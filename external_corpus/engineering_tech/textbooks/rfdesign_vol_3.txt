Preface

The book series Microwave and RF Design is a comprehensive treatment
of radio frequency (RF) and microwave design with a modern "systems-
first" approach. A strong emphasis on design permeates the series with
extensive case studies and design examples. Design is oriented towards
cellular communications and microstrip design so that lessons learned can
be applied to real-world design tasks. The books in the Microwave and RF
Design series are:

     Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems, Volume 1
     Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines, Volume 2
     Microwave and RF Design: Networks, Volume 3
     Microwave and RF Design: Modules, Volume 4
     Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators, Volume 5

The length and format of each is suitable for automatic printing and binding.

Rationale

The central philosophy behind this series's popular approach is that the
student or practicing engineer will develop a full appreciation for RF and
microwave engineering and gain the practical skills to perform system-
level design decisions. Now more than ever companies need engineers with
an ingrained appreciation of systems and armed with the skills to make
system decisions. One of the greatest challenges facing RF and microwave
engineering is the increasing level of abstraction needed to create innovative
microwave and RF systems. This book series is organized in such a way that
the reader comes to understand the impact that system-level decisions have
on component and subsystem design. At the same time, the capabilities of
technologies, components, and subsystems impact system design. The book
series is meticulously crafted to intertwine these themes.

Audience

The book series was originally developed for three courses at North
Carolina State University. One is a final-year undergraduate class, another an
introductory graduate class, and the third an advanced graduate class. Books
in the series are used as supplementary texts in two other classes. There
are extensive case studies, examples, and end of chapter problems ranging
from straight-forward to in-depth problems requiring hours to solve. A
companion book, Fundamentals of Microwave and RF Design, is more suitable
for an undergraduate class yet there is a direct linkage between the material
in this book and the series which can then be used as a career-long reference
text. I believe it is completely understandable for senior-level students
where a microwave/RF engineering course is offered. The book series is a
comprehensive RF and microwave text and reference, with detailed index,
appendices, and cross-references throughout. Practicing engineers will find
the book series a valuable systems primer, a refresher as needed, and a
vi  PREFACE

    reference tool in the field. Additionally, it can serve as a valuable, accessible
    resource for those outside RF circuit engineering who need to understand
    how they can work with RF hardware engineers.

    Organization
       This book is a volume in a five volume series on RF and microwave

    design. The first volume in the series, Microwave and RF Design: Radio
    Systems, addresses radio systems mainly following the evolution of cellular
    radio. A central aspect of microwave engineering is distributed effects
    considered in the second volume of this book series, Microwave and RF
    Design: Transmission Lines. Here transmission lines are treated as supporting
    forward- and backward-traveling voltage and current waves and these
    are related to electromagnetic effects. The third volume, Microwave and RF
    Design: Networks, covers microwave network theory which is the theory
    that describes power flow and can be used with transmission line effects.
    Topics covered in Microwave and RF Design: Modules, focus on designing
    microwave circuits and systems using modules introducing a large number
    of different modules. Modules is just another term for a network but the
    implication is that is is packaged and often available off-the-shelf. Other
    topics that are important in system design using modules are considered
    including noise, distortion, and dynamic range. Most microwave and RF
    designers construct systems using modules developed by other engineers
    who specialize in developing the modules. Examples are filter and amplifier
    modules which once designed can be used in many different systems. Much
    of microwave design is about maximizing dynamic range, minimizing noise,
    and minimizing DC power consumption. The fifth volume in this series,
    Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators, considers amplifier and
    oscillator design and develops the skills required to develop modules.

    Volume 1: Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems

    The first book of the series covers RF systems. It describes system concepts
    and provides comprehensive knowledge of RF and microwave systems.
    The emphasis is on understanding how systems are crafted from many
    different technologies and concepts. The reader gains valuable insight into
    how different technologies can be traded off in meeting system requirements.
    I do not believe this systems presentation is available anywhere else in such
    a compact form.

    Volume 2: Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines

    This book begins with a chapter on transmission line theory and introduces
    the concepts of forward- and backward-traveling waves. Many examples are
    included of advanced techniques for analyzing and designing transmission
    line networks. This is followed by a chapter on planar transmission lines
    with microstrip lines primarily used in design examples. Design examples
    illustrate some of the less quantifiable design decisions that must be made.
    The next chapter describes frequency-dependent transmission line effects
    and describes the design choices that must be taken to avoid multimoding.
    The final chapter in this volume addresses coupled-lines. It is shown how to
    design coupled-line networks that exploit this distributed effect to realize
    novel circuit functionality and how to design networks that minimize
    negative effects. The modern treatment of transmission lines in this volume
    emphasizes planar circuit design and the practical aspects of designing
PREFACE                                                                          vii

around unwanted effects. Detailed design of a directional coupler is used
to illustrate the use of coupled lines. Network equivalents of coupled lines
are introduced as fundamental building blocks that are used later in the
synthesis of coupled-line filters. The text, examples, and problems introduce
the often hidden design requirements of designing to mitigate parasitic
effects and unwanted modes of operation.

Volume 3: Microwave and RF Design: Networks

Volume 3 focuses on microwave networks with descriptions based on S
parameters and ABCD matrices, and the representation of reflection and
transmission information on polar plots called Smith charts. Microwave
measurement and calibration technology are examined. A sampling of
the wide variety of microwave elements based on transmission lines is
presented. It is shown how many of these have lumped-element equivalents
and how lumped elements and transmission lines can be combined as a
compromise between the high performance of transmission line structures
and the compactness of lumped elements. This volume concludes with an
in-depth treatment of matching for maximum power transfer. Both lumped-
element and distributed-element matching are presented.

Volume 4: Microwave and RF Design: Modules

Volume 4 focuses on the design of systems based on microwave modules.
The book considers the wide variety of RF modules including amplifiers,
local oscillators, switches, circulators, isolators, phase detectors, frequency
multipliers and dividers, phase-locked loops, and direct digital synthesizers.
The use of modules has become increasingly important in RF and microwave
engineering. A wide variety of passive and active modules are available
and high-performance systems can be realized cost effectively and with
stellar performance by using off-the-shelf modules interconnected using
planar transmission lines. Module vendors are encouraged by the market
to develop competitive modules that can be used in a wide variety of
applications. The great majority of RF and microwave engineers either
develop modules or use modules to realize RF systems. Systems must also
be concerned with noise and distortion, including distortion that originates
in supposedly linear elements. Something as simple as a termination
can produce distortion called passive intermodulation distortion. Design
techniques are presented for designing cascaded systems while managing
noise and distortion. Filters are also modules and general filter theory is
covered and the design of parallel coupled line filters is presented in detail.
Filter design is presented as a mixture of art and science. This mix, and the
thought processes involved, are emphasized through the design of a filter
integrated throughout this chapter.

Volume 5: Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators

The fifth volume presents the design of amplifiers and oscillators in
a way that enables state-of-the-art designs to be developed. Detailed
strategies for amplifiers and voltage-controlled oscillators are presented.
Design of competitive microwave amplifiers and oscillators are particularly
challenging as many trade-offs are required in design, and the design
decisions cannot be reduced to a formulaic flow. Very detailed case studies
are presented and while some may seem quite complicated, they parallel the
level of sophistication required to develop competitive designs.
viii  PREFACE

      Case Studies

      A key feature of this book series is the use of real world case studies
      of leading edge designs. Some of the case studies are designs done in
      my research group to demonstrate design techniques resulting in leading
      performance. The case studies and the persons responsible for helping to
      develop them are as follows.

         1. Software defined radio transmitter.
         2. High dynamic range down converter design. This case study was

             developed with Alan Victor.
         3. Design of a third-order Chebyshev combline filter. This case study was

             developed with Wael Fathelbab.
         4. Design of a bandstop filter. This case study was developed with Wael

             Fathelbab.
         5. Tunable Resonator with a varactor diode stack. This case study was

             developed with Alan Victor.
         6. Analysis of a 15 GHz Receiver. This case study was developed with

             Alan Victor.
         7. Transceiver Architecture. This case study was developed with Alan

             Victor.
         8. Narrowband linear amplifier design. This case study was developed

             with Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
         9. Wideband Amplifier Design. This case study was developed with Dane

             Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
        10. Distributed biasing of differential amplifiers. This case study was

             developed with Wael Fathelbab.
        11. Analysis of a distributed amplifier. This case study was developed with

             Ratan Bhatia, Jason Gerber, Tony Kwan, and Rowan Gilmore.
        12. Design of a WiMAX power amplifier. This case study was developed

             with Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
        13. Reflection oscillator. This case study was developed with Dane Collins

             and National Instruments Corporation.
        14. Design of a C-Band VCO. This case study was developed with Alan

             Victor.
        15. Oscillator phase noise analysis. This case study was developed with

             Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
         Many of these case studies are available as captioned YouTube videos and
      qualified instructors can request higher resolution videos from the author.

      Course Structures

      Based on the adoption of the first and second editions at universities,
      several different university courses have been developed using various parts
      of what was originally one very large book. The book supports teaching
      two or three classes with courses varying by the selection of volumes
      and chapters. A standard microwave class following the format of earlier
      microwave texts can be taught using the second and third volumes. Such
      a course will benefit from the strong practical design flavor and modern
      treatment of measurement technology, Smith charts, and matching networks.
      Transmission line propagation and design is presented in the context of
      microstrip technology providing an immediately useful skill. The subtleties
      of multimoding are also presented in the context of microstrip lines. In such
PREFACE                                                                            ix

a class the first volume on microwave systems can be assigned for self-
learning.

   Another approach is to teach a course that focuses on transmission line
effects including parallel coupled-line filters and module design. Such a class
would focus on Volumes 2, 3 and 4. A filter design course would focus
on using Volume 4 on module design. A course on amplifier and oscillator
design would use Volume 5. This course is supported by a large number of
case studies that present design concepts that would otherwise be difficult to
put into the flow of the textbook.

   Another option suited to an undergraduate or introductory graduate class
is to teach a class that enables engineers to develop RF and microwave
systems. This class uses portions of Volumes 2, 3 and 4. This class then omits
detailed filter, amplifier, and oscillator design.

   The fundamental philosophy behind the book series is that the broader
impact of the material should be presented first. Systems should be discussed
up front and not left as an afterthought for the final chapter of a textbook, the
last lecture of the semester, or the last course of a curriculum.

   The book series is written so that all electrical engineers can gain an
appreciation of RF and microwave hardware engineering. The body of the
text can be covered without strong reliance on this electromagnetic theory,
but it is there for those who desire it for teaching or reader review. The book
is rich with detailed information and also serves as a technical reference.

The Systems Engineer

Systems are developed beginning with fuzzy requirements for components
and subsystems. Just as system requirements provide impetus to develop
new base technologies, the development of new technologies provides new
capabilities that drive innovation and new systems. The new capabilities
may arise from developments made in support of other systems. Sometimes
serendipity leads to the new capabilities. Creating innovative microwave
and RF systems that address market needs or provide for new opportunities
is the most exciting challenge in RF design. The engineers who can
conceptualize and architect new RF systems are in great demand. This book
began as an effort to train RF systems engineers and as an RF systems
resource for practicing engineers. Many RF systems engineers began their
careers when systems were simple. Today, appreciating a system requires
higher levels of abstraction than in the past, but it also requires detailed
knowledge or the ability to access detailed knowledge and expertise. So what
makes a systems engineer? There is not a simple answer, but many partial
answers. We know that system engineers have great technical confidence and
broad appreciation for technologies. They are both broad in their knowledge
of a large swath of technologies and also deep in knowledge of a few
areas, sometimes called the "T" model. One book or course will not make
a systems engineer. It is clear that there must be a diverse set of experiences.
This book series fulfills the role of fostering both high-level abstraction of
RF engineering and also detailed design skills to realize effective RF and
microwave modules. My hope is that this book will provide the necessary
background for the next generation of RF systems engineers by stressing
system principles immediately, followed by core RF technologies. Core
technologies are thereby covered within the context of the systems in which
they are used.

1.1 Introduction to Microwave Networks

At microwave frequencies a ground plane cannot always be defined as
circuits are large enough that a "ground" in one part of a circuit is not
the same as a "ground" in another spatially separated part of the circuit.
If they were the same "ground" then charges would need to be able to
instantaneously redistribute and this is not possible because of the finite
speed of causality (that is, the speed of light). One of the consequences of
this is that voltage and current occur as forward- and backward-traveling
voltage and current waves on transmission lines, or in microwave networks
as incident and reflected voltage and current waves at interfaces between
different parts of a circuit. At any point the sum of the forward-traveling
(or incident) voltage wave and the backward-traveling (or reflected) voltage
wave is the total voltage used with low-frequency circuits. A similar
description applies to currents. A voltage wave directly relates to the
movement of power or what are called power waves. Because of this, the
conventional circuit parameters, the y and z parameters defined when there
is a single ground, prove to be inadequate to describe signals in microwave
circuits. Scattering parameters, or S parameters, are the most convenient
network parameters to use with microwave circuits as they neatly describe
the properties of traveling waves of voltage and current. A further attribute
is that the S parameters relate directly to power flow.

   In the early days of electrical engineering all circuits were called networks.
That usage remains with microwave circuits but it is more commonly used
with circuits that operate at microwave frequencies but only the external
terminals are presented and internal details often hidden. The use of the
network term also conveys a subtle reminder that there is not necessarily
a universal ground. S parameters are defined even when there is not a
universal ground.

   Most RF and microwave design is concerned with the movement of signal
power and minimizing noise power to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio
in a circuit. This maximizes the performance of communication, radar and
2  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

   sensor systems. Thus maximizing power transfer is critical and the design
   technique that does this is called matching.

   1.2 Book Outline

   Chapter 2 presents microwave network analysis and in particular S
   parameters and other parameters that are useful in design. One of the
   characteristics of a microwave designer is thatthey work very well with
   graphical information about a network. The visual display is the fastest
   way to convey information to the human brain. A human recognizes
   patterns very well so it is not surprising that microwave design methods
   have evolved to make extensive use of graphical means of representing
   network information, and of design strategies that are based on graphical
   manipulations. Graphical methods for representing the description of
   microwave networks are considered in the third chapter of this book,
   Chapter 3, entitled Graphical Network Analysis. The all important Smith
   chart is described here. Working knowledge of S parameters and of Smith
   charts are the two biggest `barriers to entry' to microwave design. They
   are the two main topics that must be understood and absorbed before one
   can become a competent microwave designer or even converse with other
   engineers about microwave designs. There is no simpler way to describe the
   intended or actual performance of a microwave circuit design.

      The fourth chapter, Chapter 4, discusses microwave measurements and
   how information about a network can be interpreted from the graphical
   display of measured information or from a design solution sketched out
   on a Smith chart. The Smith chart is the microwave engineer's `back-of-the-
   envelope' sketch pad.

      Chapter 5 introduces many novel microwave elements and these rarely
   have an analog below microwave frequencies. These circuit elements exploit
   distributed effects, i.e. transmission line effects. Sometimes there are a
   few low frequency analogs but these were developed by first conceiving
   the microwave element and then replacing transmission lines by their
   approximate LC equivalent circuits. This chapter introduces transmission
   line stubs, hybrids (which are four-port circuits that route signal power),
   baluns (which interface balanced and unbalanced circuits), and power
   combiners and dividers.

      The final two chapters in this book, Chapter 6 on impedance matching,
   i.e. matching for maximum power transfer, and Chapter 7 on broadband
   matching are concerned with the design of impedance matching networks,
   with managing the bandwidth of these networks, and with describing the
   performance of microwave circuit elements.

      This book is the third volume in a series on microwave and RF
   design. The first volume in the series addresses radio systems [1] mainly
   following the evolution of cellular radio. A central aspect of microwave
   engineering is distributed effects considered in the second volume of his
   book series [2]. Here the transmission lines are treated as supporting
   forward- and backward-traveling voltage and current waves and these
   are related to electromagnetic effects. The fourth volume [3] focuses on
   designing microwave circuits and systems using modules introducing a
   large number of different modules. Modules is just another term for a
   network but the implication is that is is packaged and often available off-the-

shelf. Other topics in this chapter that are important in system design using
modules are considered including metrics for describing noise, distortion,
and dynamic range. Most microwave and RF designers construct systems
using modules developed by other engineers who specialize in developing
the modules. Examples are filter and amplifier chip modules which once
designed can be used in many different systems. Much of microwave design
is about maximizing dynamic range, minimizing noise, and minimizing DC
power consumption. The fifth volume in this series [4] considers amplifier
and oscillator design and develops the skills required to develop modules.

2.1 Introduction

Analog circuits at frequencies up to a few tens of megahertz are characterized
by admittances, impedances, voltages, and currents. Above these frequencies
it is not possible to measure voltage, current, or impedance directly. One
reason for this is that measurement equipment is separated from the device
by lengths of transmission line that are electrically long (i.e., at least an
appreciable fraction of a wavelength long). It is better to use quantities such
as voltage reflection and transmission coefficients that can be quite readily
measured and are related to power flow. As well, in RF and microwave
circuit design the power of signals and of noise is always of interest. Thus
there is a predisposition to focus on measurement parameters that are related
to the reflection and transmission of power.

   Scattering parameters, S parameters, embody the effects of reflection
and transmission. As will be seen, it is easy to convert these to more
familiar network parameters such as admittance and impedance parameters.
In this chapter S parameters will be defined and related to impedance
and admittance parameters, then it will be demonstrated that the use
of S parameters helps in the design and interpretation of RF circuits.
S parameters have become the most important parameters for RF and
microwave engineers and many design methodologies have been developed
around them.

           This chapter presents microwave circuit theory which is based on the
        representation of distributed structures that are too large to be considered
        to be dimensionless, by lumped element circuits. The origins of microwave
        circuit theory were in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s [1-3] with extensions for
        networks with lossy transmission lines [4, 5].

        2.2 Two-Port Networks

        Many of the techniques employed in analyzing circuits require that the

        voltage at each terminal of a circuit be referenced to a common point such

        as ground. In microwave circuits it is generally difficult to do this. Recall

        that with transmission lines it is not possible to establish a common ground

        point. However, with transmission lines (and circuit elements that utilize

        distributed effects) it was seen that for each signal current there is a signal

        return current. Thus at radio frequencies, and for circuits that are distributed,

        ports are used, as shown in Figure 2-1(a), which define the voltages and

        currents for what is known as a two-port network, or just two-port.1 The

        network in Figure 2-1(a) has four terminals and two ports. A port voltage is

        defined as the voltage difference between a pair of terminals with one of the

        terminals in the pair becoming the reference terminal. The current entering

        the network at the top terminal of Port 1 is I1 and there is an equal current

        leaving the reference terminal. This arrangement clearly makes sense when

        transmission lines are attached to Ports 1 and 2, as in Figure 2-1(b). With

        transmission lines at Ports 1 and 2 there will be traveling-wave voltages, and

        at the ports the traveling-wave components add to give the total port voltage.

        In dealing with nondistributed circuits it is preferable to use the total port

        voltages and currents--V1, I1, V2, and I2, shown in Figure 2-1(a). However,

        with distributed elements it is preferable to deal with traveling voltages and
        currents--V1+,     -     +          -
                                    and        shown  in  Figure  2-1(b).  RF  and  microwave
                        V1 ,  V2 ,       V2 ,

        design necessarily requires switching between the two forms.

        2.2.1 Reciprocity, Symmetry, Passivity, and Linearity

        Reciprocity, symmetry, passivity, and linearity are fundamental properties
        of networks. A network is linear if the response (voltages and currents) is
        linearly dependent on the drive level, and superposition also applies. So if
        the two-port shown in Figure 2-1(a) is linear, the currents I1 and I2 are linear
        functions of V1 and V2. An example of a linear network would be one with
        resistors and capacitors. A network with a diode would be an example of a
        nonlinear network.

        1 Even when the term "two-port" is used on its own, the hyphen is used, as it is referring to a
          two-port network.

Figure 2-2: The z-, y-, and h- parameter equivalent circuits for port-based and global ground
representations. The immittances are shown as impedances.

   A passive network has no internal sources of power and so a network with
an embedded battery is not a passive network. A symmetrical two-port has
the same characteristics at each of the ports. An example of a symmetrical
network is a transmission line with a uniform cross section.

   A reciprocal two-port has a response at Port 2 from an excitation at Port 1
that is the same as the response at Port 1 to the same excitation at Port 2. As
an example, consider the two-port in Figure 2-1(a) with V2 = 0. If the network
is reciprocal, then the ratio I2/V1 with V2 = 0 will be the same as the ratio
I1/V2 with V1 = 0. Most networks with resistors, capacitors, and transmission
lines, for example, are reciprocal. A transistor amplifier is not reciprocal, as
gain, analogous to the ratio V2/V1, is in just one direction (or unidirectional).

2.2.2 Parameters Based on Total Voltage and Current

Here port-based impedance (z), admittance (y), and hybrid (h) parameters
will be described. These are similar to the more conventional z, y, and
h parameters defined with respect to a common or global ground. The
contrasting circuit representations of the parameters are shown in Figure 2-2.

Impedance parameters

First, port-based impedance parameters will be considered based on total
port voltages and currents as defined for the two-port in Figure 2-1. These
parameters are also referred to as port impedance parameters or just
impedance parameters when the context is understood to be ports.

   Port-based impedance parameters, or z parameters, are defined as

   V1 = z11I1 + z12I2                (2.1)             V2 = z21I1 + z22I2, (2.2)

   or in matrix form as V = ZI.                                                     (2.3)

   The double subscript on a parameter is ordered so that the first refers to
   the output and the second refers to the input, so zij relates the voltage
   output at Port i to the current input at Port j. If the network is reciprocal,
   then z12 = z21, but this simple type of relationship does not apply to all
   network parameters. The reciprocal circuit equivalence of the z parameters
   is shown in Figure 2-3(a). It will be seen that the z parameters are convenient
   parameters to use when an element is in series with one of the ports, as then
   the operation required in developing the z parameters of the larger network
   is just addition.

      Figure 2-4(a) shows the series connection of a two-terminal element with
   a two-port designated as network A. The z parameters of network A are

                                                z11 (A) z12 (A)                     (2.4)
                                     ZA = (A) (A) ,

                                                z21 z22

   so that V1(A) = z11 (A)I1 + z12 (A)I2 (2.5)         V2 = z21 (A)I1 + z22 (A)I2.  (2.6)

   Now V1 = zI1 + V1(A) = zI1 + z11 (A)I1 + z12 (A)I2,                              (2.7)
   so the z parameters of the whole network can be written as

                                     Z = z 0 0 0 + ZA. (2.8)

      What is the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the

From the original circuit

           V1 = Z11I1 + Z12I2                     (2.9)   (Z22 + ZL)V1 = (Z22 + ZL)Z11I1             (2.13)
           V2 = Z21I1 + Z22I2                    (2.10)                            +(Z22 + ZL)Z12I2  (2.14)
           V2 = E - I2ZL                         (2.11)
                                                          Z12E = Z12Z21I1 + Z12(Z22 + ZL)I2

Substituting Equation (2.11) in Equation (2.10)          Subtracting Equation (2.14) from Equation
                                                         (2.13)

           E = Z21I1 + (Z22 + ZL)I2              (2.12)  (Z22 + ZL)V1 - Z12E = [(Z22 + ZL)Z11-]I1

Multiplying Equation (2.9) by (Z22 + ZL) and              V1 =  Z12 E        + Z11 -  Z12 Z21   I1 (2.15)

                                                                Z22 + ZL              Z22 + ZL

For the Thevenin equivalent circuit V1 = ETH + I1ZTH and so

           ZTH =                         Z12 Z21                              Z12 E             (2.16)
                               Z11 -                     and ETH =

                                       Z22 + ZL                            Z22 + ZL

Admittance parameters

When an element is in shunt with a two-port, port-based admittance param-
eters, or y parameters, are the most convenient to use. These are defined as

I1 = y11V1 + y12V2             (2.17)            I2 =y21V1 + y22V2,          (2.18)

or in matrix form as I = YV.                                                 (2.19)

Now, for reciprocity, y12 = y21 and the circuit equivalence of the y parameters
is shown in Figure 2-3(b). Consider the shunt connection of an element
shown in Figure 2-4(b) where the y parameters of network A are

           YA =                y11 (A)  y12 (A)  = ZA-1.                     (2.20)
                               y21 (A)  y22 (A)

The port voltages and currents are related as follows

I1(A) = y11 (A)V1 + y12 (A)V2  and               I2 = y21 (A)V1 + y22 (A)V2  (2.21)
                                                                             (2.22)
I1 = yV1 + I1(A) = (y + y11 (A))V1 + y12 (A)V2.

Thus the y parameters of the whole network are

                       Y=      y0       + YA.                                (2.23)

                                                         represented as two-port networks.

    Hybrid parameters

    Sometimes it is more convenient to use hybrid parameters, or h parameters,
    defined by

    V1 = h11I1 + h12V2 and I2 = h21I1 + h22V2,                     (2.24)

    or in matrix form as

                          V1 I2 = H I1 V2 .                        (2.25)

    These parameters are convenient to use with transistor circuits, as they
    describe a voltage-controlled current source that is a simple model of a
    transistor.

       The choice of which network parameters to use depends on convenience,
    but as will be seen throughout this text, some parameters naturally describe
    a particular characteristic desired in a design. For example, with Port 1 being
    the input port of an amplifier and Port 2 being the output port, h21 describes
    the current gain of the amplifier.

    2.2.3 Series Connection of Two-Port Networks

    A series connection of two two-ports is shown in Figure 2-5. An example
    of when the series connection occurs is shown in Figure 2-6, which is the
    schematic of a transistor amplifier configuration with an inductor in the
    source leg. The transistor and the inductor can each be represented as two-
    ports so that the circuit of Figure 2-6(a) is the series connection of two two-
    ports, as shown in Figure 2-6(b). In the following, two-port parameters of the
    complete circuit are developed using the two-port parameter descriptions of
    the component two-ports. The procedure with any interconnection is to write
    down the relationships between the voltages and currents of the constituent
    networks. Which network parameters to use requires identification of the
    arithmetic path requiring the fewest operations.

       Simple algebra relates the various total voltage and current parameters.
    From Figure 2-5,

                                                                               Figure 2-7: Parallel connec-

    V1(A)    z11 (A) z12 (A)         I1(A)     V1(B)          z11 (B) z12 (B)  I1(B)
      (A) =  (A) (A)                   (A) ;     (B) =        (B) (B)          I2(B)
    V2       z21 z22                 I2        V2             z21 z22
                                                                                 (2.26)

or                                V1 V2 = (ZA + ZB ) I1 I2 .

                                                                               (2.27)

Thus the impedance matrix of the series connection of two-ports is

                                     Z = ZA + ZB.                              (2.28)

2.2.4 Parallel Connection of Two-Port Networks

Admittance parameters are most conveniently combined to obtain the over-
all parameters of the two-port parallel connection of Figure 2-7. The total
voltage and current are related by

        V1(A) = V1(B) = V1             (2.29)             I1 = I1(A) + I1(B)   (2.31)
        V2(A) = V2(B) = V2             (2.30)             I2 = I2(A) + I2(B)   (2.32)

and                        I1(A)         y11 (A) y12 (A)    V1(A)              (2.33)
                           I2(A)                            V2(A)
                                  =         (A) (A)
                                         y21 y22

             I1(B)                       y11 (B) y12 (B)  V1(B)
               (B) =                        (B) (B)         (B) .              (2.34)
             I2                          y21 y22
                                                          V2

So the overall y parameter relation is

                                  I1 I2 = (YA + YB) V1 V2 .                    (2.35)

Figure 2-8 is an example of subcircuits that can be represented as two-ports
that are then connected in parallel.

                                                                          networks.

        two-ports shown in Figure 2-9. Now,

        I1(A) = I1(B) = I1                            (2.36)           V1 = V1(A) + V1(B)        (2.38)
        V2(A) = V2(B) = V2                            (2.37)           I2 = I2(A) + I2(B),       (2.39)

        and so, using hybrid parameters,

                                           V1(A)      h11 (A) h12 (A)  I1(A)
                                             (A) =    (A) (A)          V2(A)                     (2.40)
                                           I2         h21 h22          I1(B) (B) .               (2.41)
                                                                       V2
                                           V1(B)      h11 (B) h12 (B)
                                             (B) =    (B) (B)
                                           I2         h21 h22

        Putting this in compact form:

                                               V1 I2 = (HA + HB) I1 V2 .                         (2.42)

        2.2.6 ABCD Matrix Characterization of Two-Port Networks

        ABCD parameters are the best parameters to use when cascading two-
        ports, as in Figure 2-10, and total voltage and current relationships are
        required. First, consider Figure 2-11, which puts the voltages and currents
MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                        13

                                    Figure 2-11: Two-port network with cascadable voltage and
                                    current definitions.

in cascadable form with the input variables in terms of the output variables:

                          Va Ia = A B C D Vb Ib .                  (2.43)

The reciprocity relationship of the ABCD parameters is not as simple as for
the z and y parameters. To see this, first express ABCD parameters in terms
of z parameters. Note that the current at Port 2 is in the opposite direction to
the usual definition of the two-port current shown in Figure 2-1(a). So

Va = V1                        (2.44)       Vb = V2                (2.47)
Ia = I1                        (2.45)       Ib = -I2               (2.48)
Va = z11Ia - z12Ib             (2.46)       Vb = z21Ia - z22Ib.    (2.49)

From Equation (2.49),     Ia = z22 Ib + 1 Vb,                      (2.50)
                               z21     z21

and substituting this into Equation (2.46) yields

                       Va = z11 Vb + z11 z22 - z12 Ib.             (2.51)
                          z21          z21

Comparing Equations (2.50) and (2.51) to Equation (2.43) leads to

                       A = z11/z21     B = z/z21                   (2.52)
                       C = 1/z21       D = z22/z21,

where z = z11z22 - z12z21.                                         (2.53)

Rearranging,

              z11 = A/C             z12 = (AD - BC)/C              (2.54)
              z21 = 1/C             z22 = D/C.

   Now the reciprocity condition in terms of ABCD parameters can be
determined. For z parameters, z12 = z21 for reciprocity; that is, from
Equation (2.54), for a reciprocal network,

              AD - BC = 1 and AD - BC = 1.                         (2.55)
                       C       C

Thus for a two-port network to be reciprocal, AD - BC = 1. The utility of
these parameters is that the ABCD matrix of the cascade connection of N
two-ports in Figure 2-10 is equal to the product of the ABCD matrices of the
individual two-ports:

A B C D = A1 B1 C1 D1 A2 B2 C2 D2    AN BN CN DN .              (2.56)

See Table 2-1 for the ABCD parameters of several two-port networks.

                2.3 Scattering Parameters

                Direct measurement of the z, y, h, and ABCD parameters requires that
                the ports be terminated in either short or open circuits. For active circuits,
                such terminations could result in undesired behavior, including oscillation
                or destruction. Also, at RF it is difficult to realize a good open or short. Since
                RF circuits are designed with close attention to maximum power transfer
                conditions, resistive terminations are preferred, as these are closer to the
                actual operating conditions. Thus the effect of measurement errors will have
                less impact than when parameter extraction relies on imperfect opens and
                shorts. The essence of scattering parameters (or S parameters2) is that they
                relate forward- and backward-traveling waves on a transmission line, thus
                S parameters are related to power flow.

                   The discussion of S parameters begins by considering the reflection
                coefficient, which is the S parameter of a one-port network.

                2.3.1 Reflection Coefficient

                The reflection coefficient, , of a load, as in Figure 2-12, can be determined by
                separately measuring the forward- and backward-traveling voltages on the
                transmission line:

                                                       V -(x)                      (2.57)
                                             (x) = + .

                                                       V (x)

                2 For historical reasons a capital "S" is used when referring to S parameters. For most other
                  network parameters, lowercase is used (e.g., z parameters for impedance parameters).
MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                             15

                                      characteristic impedance Z0 and
                                      length  terminated in a load of
                                      impedance ZL.

 at the load is related to the impedance ZL by

                       (0) = ZL - Z0 ,                                         (2.58)
                                 ZL + Z0

where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the connecting transmission line.
This can also be written as

                       (0) = Y0 - YL ,                                         (2.59)
                                 Y0 + YL

where Y0 = 1/Z0 and YL = 1/ZL.

2.3.2 Reflection Coefficient with Complex Reference
         Impedance

Here the reflection coefficient of ZL in Figure 2-13 will be developed with

respect to the complex reference impedance Zg.The total voltage and current

at the load are

   V = Vg ZL           (2.60)         and I = Vg .                             (2.61)
            Zg + ZL                                 Zg + ZL

To develop the reflection coefficient, first define equivalent forward- and

backward-traveling waves. This can be done by imagining that between

the generator and the load there is a transmission line of characteristic

impedance Zg which has infinitesimal length. The incident voltage and cur-
rent waves (V +, I+) are the total voltage and current obtained when the gen-
erator is conjugately matched to the load (i.e., ZL = Zg). So the equations of
forward-traveling voltage and current become3

+                Zg                             I+ = Vg 1 .
V = Vg                = VgZg 2R {Zg}  (2.62)               2R {Zg}             (2.63)
        Zg + Zg

Now return to considering the actual load, ZL. The reflected voltage and
current (V -, I-) are obtained by calculating the actual voltage and current

at the source using the relationships

        V =V++V-       (2.64)                   I = I+ + I-                    (2.65)

    to determine the backward-traveling components. In Equations (2.64) and
    (2.65) the forward-traveling components are those in Equations (2.62) and
    (2.63). From Equation (2.62),

                                            Vg = V  +    Zg  +   Z

                                                                   g

    V is the voltage reflection coefficient, which is usually denoted as just ,

    while I is the current reflection coefficient. It is clear that V = 0 = I

                       g

    resistive (i.e., when Zg = Rg). Generally the reflection coefficients are defined

    using a purely resistive Zg. This becomes the reference resistance, which is

    more commonly referred to as the reference impedance, Z0, or, if the same

    reference impedance is used throughout, the system impedance.

    2.3.3 Two-Port S Parameters

    Two-port S parameters are defined in terms of traveling waves on transmis-
    sion lines with real characteristic impedance Z0 attached to each of the ports
    of the network, see Figure 2-1(b):

          -               +          +                             -             +     +

    where Sij are the individual S parameters. In matrix form the equations
    above become

                          V1 -           S11 S12             V1  +               V1 +

    Individual S parameters are determined by measuring the forward- and

    backward-traveling waves with loads ZL = Z0 at the ports. For the output
                                                                +

    The remaining three parameters are determined similarly and so S22 is found
    as

   In the above Z0 is referred to as the normalization impedance or
equivalently the reference impedance. In some circumstances ZREF is
used to denote reference impedance to avoid possible confusion with a

transmission line impedance that is not the same as the reference impedance.
The S parameters here are also called normalized S parameters, and the S

parameters are normalized to the same reference impedance at each port.
Calling them normalized S parameters also carrys the additional meaning
that the S parameters are referenced to the one real impedance.

   The relationships between the two-port S parameters and the common
network parameters are given in Table 2-2. It is interesting to note that
S21/S12 = z21/z12 = y21/y12 = h21/h12. That is, the ratio of the forward
to reverse parameters (at least for S, z, y, and h parameters) are the same and
this ratio is one for a reciprocal device. An S parameter is a voltage ratio, so
when it is expressed in decibels Sij|dB = 20 log(Sij).

   A reciprocal network has S12 = S21. If unit power flows into a two-
port (with ports terminated in the reference impedance), a fraction, |S11|2,
is reflected and a further fraction, |S21|2, is transmitted through the network.

EXAMPLE 2.2 Two-Port S Parameters

What are the S parameters of a 30 dB attenuator?
Solution:

An attenuator is shown with a system impedance
of Z0. An ideal attenuator has no reflection at each
of the two ports when the attenuator is embedded
in its system impedance. Thus in = 0 = out.
Since there is no reflection from the load or the
source, this implies that S11 = 0 = S22.
Since this is a 30 dB attenuator, the power delivered to the load impedance Z0 is 30 dB
below the power available from the source, thus S21 = -30 dB = 0.0316. The attenuator is
reciprocal and so S12 = S21. Thus the S parameters of the attenuator are

S = 0 0.0316 .                                                                               (2.76)
         0.0316 0

Note that the reference impedance did not need to be known to develop the S parameters.

                               Network

                         A two-port is shown in Figure 2-14 that is terminated at Port 2 in a load with
                         a reflection coefficient L. The lines at each of the ports are of infinitesimal
                         length (i.e., 1  0 and 2  0) and are used to make it easier to visualize the
                         separation of the voltage into forward- and backward-traveling components.
                         The aim in this section is to develop a formula for the input reflection
                         coefficient in = V1-/V1+. For the circuit in Figure 2-14 three equations can
                         be developed:

2.3.5 Evaluation of the Scattering Parameters of an Element

Scattering parameters can be derived analytically for various circuit

configurations and in this section the procedure is illustrated for the shunt

element of Figure 2-15. The procedure to find S11 is to match Port 2 so that
   +
      =  0,  then  S11  is  the  reflection  coefficient  at  Port  1:
V2

                                        S11 = Y0 - Yin ,                                  (2.85)
                                                Y0 + Yin

where Yin = Y0 + Y , since the matched termination at Port 2 (i.e., Y0 = 1/Z0)
shunts the admittance Y . Thus

                               S11 = Y0 - Y0 - Y = -Y .                                   (2.86)
                                        2Y0 + Y           2Y0 + Y

From the symmetry of the two-port,

                                             S22 = S11.                                   (2.87)

S21 is evaluated by determining the transmitted wave, V2-, with the output
                                                                                             +
line  matched      so  that  again  an  admittance,  Y0,    is  placed  at  Port  2  and        =  0.
                                                                                          V2

After some algebraic manipulation,

                                    S21 = 2Y0/(Y + 2Y0)                                   (2.88)

is obtained. Since this is clearly a reciprocal network, S12 = S21 and all
four S parameters are obtained. A similar procedure of selectively applying
matched loads is used to obtain the S parameters of other networks.

EXAMPLE 2.3 Calculation of the S Parameters of a Two-Port Network

    Derive the two-port 50  S param-
    eters of the resistive circuit to the
    right.

    Solution:
    Calculation of S11. This involves terminating Port 2
    in the system reference impedance, 50 , and then
    calculating the input impedance of the augmented
    network. This is then converted to a reflection
    coefficient, which here is S11. The circuit for
    calculation is to the right. Now

                  ZIN = 100  [25 $ (50  50)]  = 100  50  = 33.33 ,                    (2.89)

    where  indicates the parallel-connection calculation and $ indicates the series-connection
    calculation. Thus

                  S11 = IN = ZIN - Z0 = 33.33 - 50 = -0.2.                            (2.90)
                                    ZIN + Z0 33.33 + 50

    Calculation of S21. This involves terminating Port 2 in the system reference impedance, 50 ,
    and then calculating the forward-traveling voltage wave at Port 1 and the reverse-traveling
    voltage wave at Port 2. Note that the reverse-traveling voltage wave at Port 2 is leaving the
    two-port.

    Since there is no wave reflected from the termination
    at Port 2, the total voltage at Port 2 is just V2-. The

    circuit for calculation is on the right.

                         V1 = V1+ + V1- = V1+ (1 + S11)  V1+ = V1 1 + S = 1.25V1. 11  (2.91)
    The voltage at Port 1 is                                                          (2.92)

                           V1 = I1ZIN = 33.33I1  V1+ = 1.25  33.33I1 = 41.66I1.

    The next step is to find an expression for I2:

                  V1 = I1ZIN = 33.33I1 = I2(25 $ 50  50) = 50I2.                      (2.93)

    Rearranging,  I2 = I1 33.33 = 0.6667I1.                                           (2.94)
                              50

    Now           V2- = V2 = I2(50  50) = 25I2 = 16.67I1.                             (2.95)

    So            V2- 16.67                                  = 0.4.
                  S21 = + =                                                           (2.96)
                  V1 41.66

    Calculation of S12. The two-port is a reciprocal network (as are all networks with only
    lumped R, L, and C elements) and so S12 = S21.

    Calculation of S22. Using a similar procedure
    to that used for finding S11, the circuit for the
    calculation is on the right:
MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                                 21

       ZIN = 50  [25 $ (100  50)]  = 50  (25$33.33) = 50  58.33 = 26.92 .          (2.97)
                                                                                   (2.98)
       Therefore                 S22 = IN = 26.92 - 50 = -0.3.
                                                   26.92 + 50                      (2.99)

       Collecting the individual S parameters:
                                                     S = -0.2 0.4 .
                                                               0.4 -0.3

2.3.6 Properties of a Two-Port in Terms of S Parameters

The properties of most interest are whether the two-port network is lossless,
passive, or reciprocal.

   If a network is lossless, all of the power input to the network must leave
the network. The power incident on Port 1 of a network is

                           +          1 +2                               (2.100)

                        P1 =          2 V1
                                       Z0

and the power leaving Port 1 is

                           -     =    1 -22 .                            (2.101)

                        P1             V1

                                      Z0

This can be repeated for Port 2 and the factor 12 /Z0 appears in all expressions.
So cancelling this factor, the condition for the network to be lossless is

                  |S11|2 + |S21|2 = 1 and |S12|2 + |S22|2 = 1.           (2.102)

   For a network to be passive, no more power can leave the network than
enters it. So the condition for passivity is

                  |S11|2 + |S21|2  1 and |S12|2 + |S22|2  1.             (2.103)

Reciprocity requires that S21 = S12.

2.3.7 Scattering Transfer or T Parameters

S parameters relate reflected waves to incident waves, thus mixing the
quantities at the input and output ports. However, in dealing with cascaded
networks it is preferable to relate the traveling waves at the input ports to
the output ports. Such parameters are called the scattering transfer (or ST )
parameters, which for a two-port network are defined by

                     -           S T 11 S T 12     +

                  V1                            V2
                    +=S                  S        -,                     (2.104)
                  V1             T 21 T 22
                                                V2

where

                        S S T = T S 11 S T S 12 .                        (2.105)
                                     T 21 T 22

Figure 2-16: N -port network
with traveling voltage and cur-
rent waves.

    The two-port ST parameters and S parameters are related by

         S T S 11 S T S 12 = -(S11S22 - S12S21)/S21 (S11/S21)                            (2.106)
         T 21 T 22                        -(S22/S21)         (1/S21)

    and

         S11 S12                 =  S T 12S T 22 -1 (S T 11 - S T 12S T 22 -1S T 21)  .  (2.107)
                                    S -1              S -1S
         S21 S22                    T 22  - T 22 T 21

       Very often the ST parameters are called T parameters, but there are at least

    two types of T parameters, so it is necessary to be specific. (Another form will
    be introduced in Section 2.6.) If networks A and B have parameters STA and
    STB, then the ST parameters of the cascaded network are

                                    S T = S TA  S TB.                                   (2.108)

       There are two forms of the scattering T parameters. Here the scattering
    transfer parameters are designated as the ST parameters but often T on

    its own is used. The other more common form are the chain scattering

    parameters which will be considered in Section 2.6.

    2.4 Generalized Scattering Parameters

    The scattering parameters up to now are known as normalized S parameters
    because they have the same reference impedance at each port. However the
    qualification `normalized' is not used unless it is necessary to distinguish
    them from a more general form of S parameters. In this section generalized
    S parameters that have different reference impedances at each of the ports
    are considered. These are particularly useful in designing amplifiers but are
    also useful in measurements where the system impedance of a design may
    not be the same as the reference impedance of the measurement system.
    For example an RFIC may have a system impedance of 100 , but the
    measurement system have a reference impedance of 50 .

    2.4.1 The N-Port Network

    The N -port network is a generalization of a two-port, as you may have
    guessed. A network with many ports is shown in Figure 2-16. Again, each
    port consists of a pair of terminals, one of which is the reference for voltage.
    Each port has equal and opposite currents at the two terminals. The incident
    and reflected voltages at any port can be related to each other using the
MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                                                             23

              ..  =  ..                                                              ..  ,                  (2.109)
             .  .                                            ..  .                  .

or in compact form as V- = SV+                                                                              . (2.110)

Notice that                                          
                                                     Vi  - 
                                        Sij = +                              .                              (2.111)
                                                     Vj  +
                                                             Vk =0 for k=j

   In words, Sij is found by driving Port j with an incident wave of voltage
Vj+ and measuring the reflected wave Vi- at Port i, with all ports other than
j terminated in a matched load. Reflection and transmission coefficients can
also be defined using the above relationship, provided that the ports are
terminated in matched loads:

     Sii : reflection coefficient seen looking into Port i
     Sij : transmission coefficient from j to i.

2.4.2 Power Waves

The S parameters used so far have the same reference impedance at each

port. These can be generalized so that the reference impedances at each port

can be different. These are useful if the actual system being considered has
different loading conditions at the ports. Generalized S parameters, denoted
here as GS, are defined in terms of what are called root power waves,

which in turn are defined using forward- and backward-traveling voltage
waves. Consider the N -port network of Figure 2-16, where the nth port has a
reference transmission line of characteristic impedance Z0n, which can have
infinitesimal length. The transmission line at the nth port serves to separate
the forward- and backward-traveling voltage (Vn+ and Vn-) and current (In+
and In-) waves.

   The reference characteristic impedance matrix Z0 is a diagonal matrix, Z0
= diag(Z01 . . . Z0n . . . Z0N ), and the root power waves at the nth port, an and
bn, are defined by

                                                                                   
             an = Vn+/  {Z0n} and bn = Vn-/  {Z0n},                                                         (2.112)

and shown in Figure 2-17 and are often called just power waves. The unit of
the a and b values is root power, that is, in the SI unit system, W. In matrix
form

  a = Z0-1/2V+ = Y01/2V+,                                      b = Z0-1/2V- = Y01/2V-,                      (2.113)
V+ = Z01/2a = Y0-1/2a,                                       V- = Z01/2b = Y0-1/2b,                         (2.114)

where

       a = [a1 . . . an . . . aN ]T,                         b = [b1 . . . bn . . . bN ]T,                  (2.115)

                     interpreted as describing power flow:

                                             12 |an| =     incident power at Port n              (2.117)
                                     and 12 |bn| =         power leaving at Port n.

                     That is, for example, the incident (or available) power at Port n, referenced
                     to Z0n, is 12 |an|2 and the reflected power at the port is 12 |bn|2. Thus the power
                     delivered by the nth port is 12 (|bn|2 - |an|2).

                        After some manipulation it can be shown that on each reference line the
                     power waves can be related to the total voltages and currents as

                                     a = V + Z0I and b = V - Z0I ,                               (2.118)
                                               2 {Z0}                      2 {Z0}

                     where V and I are vectors of total voltage and total current. Now, generalized
                     S parameters can be formally defined as

                                                           b = GSa,                              (2.119)

                     thus Y01/2V- = GSY01/2V+, and so V- = Y0-1/2GSY01/2V+. This reduces
                     to V- = GSV+ when all of the reference transmission lines have the same

                     characteristic impedance. However, when the ports have different reference
                     impedances, SV is used for voltage scattering parameters and SI for current
                     scattering parameters, where V- = SV V+ and I- = SI I+.

                        The following conversion relationships can also be derived:

                                     SI = {Z0}- 21 GS{Z0} 21                                     (2.120)

                        Recall that GS is in terms of a and b, SI is in terms of I- and I+, and SV

                     is in terms of V- and V+ . When port impedances and reference resistances

                     are real, Equations (2.120) and (2.121) assume the simpler forms

                     resistance at the nth port. In addition, if the reference resistances at each

                     port are the same, all of the various scattering parameter definitions become

equivalent (i.e., SV = -SI = GS = S), where S is the normalized S
parameter matrix, also called the normalized S parameter matrix.

   The reciprocity condition for generalized S parameters is GS12 =

  EXAMPLE 2.4 Generalized Scattering Parameters of a Through Connection

Develop the generalized

scattering parameters of a

through connection with a

reference impedance Z01

at Port 1 and a reference          (a)                (b)           (c)

impedance Z02 at Port 2.

Solution:

The through connection is shown in (a) and in (b) is the configuration to determine S11 as

V2+ = 0 = a2 since Port 2 is terminated in Z02. Then

        GS11 = in =  Z02 - Z01                 GS22 =    Z01 - Z02  G
                                and similarly                       = - S11      (2.124)
                     Z02 + Z01                           Z02 + Z01

Figure (b) is used to determine S21 as here V2+ = 0 = a2            {Z01 }.      (2.125)
           V2- = b2 {Z02} = V1 = V1+ + V1- = V1+(1 + S11) = a1                   (2.126)

Thus,

GS21 =  b2       =   {Z01 }     G              G           {Z02 }   G
                             (1 + S11) and also S12 =               (1 + S22).
        a1 a2=0      {Z02 }                                {Z01 }

The generalized scattering parameter matrix of the through is

   GS=      1                Z02 - Z01         2Z01 {Z02}/{Z01}                  (2.127)
                                                                                 (2.128)
            Z01 + Z02 2Z02 {Z01}/{Z02 }               Z01 - Z02
                                                           
                                   1         Z02 - Z01 2 Z01Z02
                          G
and for real Z01 and Z02 S =
                                Z01 + Z02 2 Z01Z02 Z01 - Z02

For normalized S parameters the reference impedances at the ports are the same, i.e. Z01 =
Z0 = Z02, and the normalized S parameters of the through are (as expected)

                                      N        01
                                S= S=                 .                          (2.129)
                                               10

2.4.3 Scattering Parameters in Terms of a and b waves

Previously S parameters were defined in terms of forward- and backward-
traveling voltage waves, see Section 2.3.3 and Equation (2.71). That definition
is adequate if only one reference impedance is used throughout. A more
general form of S parameters uses the a and b root power waves. This is still
valid if only one reference impedance is used but they can also be used when
the ports have different reference impedances. This more general definition
for a two-port network, with respect to Figure 2-18, is

                    b1 b2 = S11 S12 S21 S22  a1 a2 .                (2.130)

Even if the reference impedances at ports 1 and 2 are the different. If the
references impedance are the same and real, the usual case, the scattering
26  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

    parameters are identical when used to relate traveling voltage waves as in
    the following:

    V1-   S11 S12                                                    +

    V2-=  S21 S22                                                 V1         (2.131)
                                                                    +.

                                                                  V2

    2.4.4 Normalized and Generalized S Parameters

    S parameters measured with respect to a common reference resistance are
    referred to as normalized S parameters. In almost all cases, measured S
    parameters are normalized to 50 , as 50  cables and components are
    used in measurement systems. In other words, Z01 = Z02 = . . . =
    Z0N = R0 (= 50 ). Generalized S parameters can be used to simplify
    the design process of devices such as amplifiers. For example, it is often
    convenient to use the input and output impedances of an amplifier as the
    normalization impedances. Also, it is often desirable to be able to convert
    between measured S parameters (normalized to 50 ) and generalized S
    parameters. Let N S be the measured (normalized) S parameter matrix. (So
    N S is the conventional S parameter matrix.) The development is tedious, but
    it can be shown that the generalized S parameters are

    GS = (D)-1(N S - )(U -  N S)-1D,                                         (2.132)

    where U is the unit matrix (U = diag(1, 1, . . . , 1)), R0 is the reference
    impedance of the normalized S parameters, N S, and D is a diagonal matrix
    with elements

    Dii = |1 - i |-1(1 - i) 1 - |i|2                                         (2.133)
     i = (Z0i - R0)(Z0i + R0)-1 i = 1, 2, . . . , N,                         (2.134)

    and  is a diagonal matrix with elements i. Z0i is the system impedance at
    Port i to which the generalized S parameters are to be referred.

    2.4.5 Change of Reference Impedance

    The result in the section above can be used to change scattering parameters
    referenced to a real impedance R1 (i.e., R1S) to scattering parameters
    referenced to R2 (i.e., R2S). Note that R1S and R2S are the conventional
    or normalized S parameters. The elements in Equations (2.133) and (2.134)
    become

    Dii = D = |1 - R2|-1(1 - R2)  1 - |R2|2 =                     1 - |R2|2  (2.135)
    R2 = (R2 - R1)(R2 + R1)-1,                                               (2.136)

    and |R2| < 1. So Equation (2.132) becomes

    R2S = D-1(R1S - )(U - R1S)-1D = (R1S - )(U - R1S)-1 (2.137)

Figure 2-18: Definition of S parameters in terms of a and b root
power waves. a1 = V1+/{Z01}, b1 = V1-/{Z01}, a2 =
V2+/{Z02}, b2 = V2-/{Z02}. Incident power at Port 1 (2) is |a1|2
(|a22). Power leaving Port 1 (2) is |b1|2 (|b22)
MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                                       27

since D is a diagonal matrix with all diagonal entries the same. So for a two-
port

R2S =   R2 S11  R2 S12
     =  R2 S21  R2 S22

        R1S11 - R2          R1 S12            1 - R2R1S11      -R2R1S R1 12 -1 .
            R1S21       R1S22 - R2             -R2 R1 S21     1 - R2 S22

                                                                               (2.138)

EXAMPLE 2.5 Change of Reference Impedance

An attenuator has the 50  S parameters:

                                   50S =            0 0.3162 .                          (2.139)
                                                 0.3162 0                               (2.140)

What are the S parameters referenced to 75 ?

Solution:
The conversion uses Equation (2.138) with R1 = 50  and R2 = 75 .
So 75 = (75 - 50)/(75 + 50) = 0.2. Thus the S parameters referenced to 75  are

        75S =   50S11 - 75      50 S12                 1 - 7550S11   -75 50 S12
                    50 S21  50S22 - 75                  -75 50 S21  1 - 7550S22

                = -0.2 0.3162                    1        -0.2  0.3162
                      0.3162 -0.2
                                       -0.2  0.3162          1

                = -0.2 0.3162                 1 0.06324 = -0.18 0.3036 .
                      0.3162 -0.2      0.06324         1            0.3036 -0.18

2.4.6 Passivity in Terms of Scattering Parameters

Consider an N -port characterized by its generalized scattering matrix S. The
time-averaged power dissipated in the N -port is

                    1 2 N           2         1 T          T
                P=         (|ai| - |bi| ) = 2 a a - b b ,                (2.141)
                    2 i=1

and so P = 12 aT U - (S)TS a.                                            (2.142)

In the above, the conjugate, a, of the matrix a is obtained from a by taking
the complex conjugate of each element. For a passive N -port,

                        U - (S)TS  0 for all real ,                      (2.143)

This can also be written in summation form as

                            N

                                              =  Pj .                    (2.144)

    whether a network is lossless, lossy, or perhaps has gain.

    For a lossless N -port, U - STS = 0.                                           (2.145)

    Rearranging, taking the transpose of both sides and noting that UT = U

                                           SST = U.                                (2.146)

    This is known as the unitary condition. That is, for a lossless N -port

                                          S = ST-1 .                               (2.147)

    The important result here is that for a lossless network (these are the unitary
    conditions)

                         N                =  1                                     (2.148)

    2.4.7 Impedance Matrix Representation

    In this section N -port S parameters are related to N -port z parameters. The
    basic relationship of voltage and current at any port using impedances is

                                      z11 z12 . . . z1N

     ..  =  ..                                                         ..  ,       (2.150)
    .  .                                                              . 

      VN                             zN1 zN2 . . . zNN                     IN

    or in compact form as V = ZI                                                   . (2.151)

    Z is reciprocal if zij = zji. The z parameters defined here are more formally
    called port-based z parameters, as the voltage and current variables are port
    quantities.

       Relating z and S parameters begins by relating the total voltage and
    current at the nth terminal plane to the traveling voltage and current waves.
    From Figure 2-16,

                        Vn  =     +  +    Vn-,  and         In  =    +  -  In-,    (2.152)

                               Vn                                  In

    and in vector form

                        V = V+ + V-                        I = I+ + I-             (2.153)
                                                        V- = -Z0I-,
                        V+     =  Z I+

                                     0

    where Z0 = diag(Z01, Z02, . . . , Z0N ) (and z0n can be complex). After some
    algebraic manipulation, the following relationships are obtained:

                            V                   -1 -1        -1
                        S = [U + ZZ0 ] [Z(Z0) - U]                                 (2.154)
                                                                                   (2.155)
                            Z  =  [U  +   SV        -1  -      -1 V     )]-1.

Note that SV is the voltage scattering parameter matrix. These are related
to the generalized scattering parameter matrix by Equation (2.123). For
normalized S parameters the same real reference impedance is used at all
ports (Z0n = Z0, n = 1, . . . , N ), then Equations (2.154) and (2.155) become

In this section, N -port S parameters are related to N -port y parameters. The
currents and voltages are related as

          y11 y12 . . . y1N              
  I1                                                  V1

  I2      y21  y22 . . .    y2N                       V2  
                      ...                                 
 ..  =  ..                                ..  ,             (2.157)
.  .                                     . 

  IN      yN1 yN2 . . . yNN                           VN

or in compact form the port-based y parameters are

               I = YV.                                      (2.158)

   Using a similar approach to that in the previous subsection, the relation-
ship between S and y parameters can be developed. The development will

be done slightly differently and this development is applicable to general-

ized scattering parameters. First, consider the relationship of the total port
voltage V = [V1 . . . Vn . . . VN ]T and current I = [I1 . . . In . . . IN ]T to forward-
and backward-traveling voltage and current waves:

      V = V+ + V- and I = I+ + I-,                          (2.159)

where I+ = Y0V+ = Y01/2a and I- = -Y0V- = -Y01/2b. (Each element
of Y0, Y0n = 1/Z0n and can be complex.) Using traveling waves, Equation

(2.158) becomes

                      I+ + I- = Y(V+ + V-)                  (2.160)
             Y0(V+ - V-) = Y(V+ + V-)                       (2.161)
Y0(1 - Y0-1/2SY01/2)V+ = Y(1 + Y0-1/2SY01/2)V+,             (2.162)

and so the port y parameters in terms of the generalized scattering
parameters are

Y = Y0(1 - Y0-1/2GSY01/2)(1 + Y0-1/2GSY01/2)-1.             (2.163)

Alternatively, Equation (2.161) can be rearranged as

(Y0 + Y)V- = (Y0 - Y)V+                                     (2.164)
            V- = (Y0 + Y)-1(Y0 - Y)V+                       (2.165)
                                                            (2.166)
       Y0-1/2b = (Y0 + Y)-1(Y0 - Y)Y0-1/2a.

Comparing this to the definition of generalized S parameters in Equation
(2.119) leads to

  GS = Y01/2(Y0 + Y)-1(Y0 - Y)Y0-1/2.                       (2.167)

    2.5 Scattering Parameter Matrices of Common Two-Ports

    RF and microwave circuits can generally be represented as interconnected
    two-ports, as most RF and microwave circuit designs involve cascaded
    functional blocks such as amplifiers, matching networks, filters, etc.4 (see
    Figure 2-19). Thus there is great interest in various manipulations that can
    be performed on two-ports as well as the network parameters of common
    two-port circuit topologies. As an example, consider the matching networks
    in Figure 2-19. These are used to achieve maximum power transfer in an
    amplifier by acting as impedance transformers. Matching networks assume
    a variety of forms, as shown in Figure 2-20, and all can be viewed as two-
    port networks and a combination of simpler components. In this section,
    strategies are presented for developing the S parameters of two-ports.

    Transmission Line

    The traveling waves on a transmission line (Figure 2-21(a)) have a phase that
    depends on the electrical length, , of the line. The transmission line has a
    characteristic impedance, Z0, and length, , which in general is different from

    4 This arrangement tends to maximize bandwidth, minimize losses, and maximize efficiency.
      Lower-frequency analog design utilizes more complex arrangements; for example, feedback
      high in the circuit hierarchy improves the reliability and robustness of design but comes at the
      cost of reduced bandwidth and lower power efficiency.

the system reference impedance, here Z01. Thus

S11 = S22 =    (1 - e-2)                           (1 - 2)e-
               2 -2 and S21 = S12 =                2 -2 ,     (2.169)

                                Z0 + Z01

   If the reference impedance is the same as the characteristic impedance of
the line, i.e. Z01 = Z0 and  = 0, the scattering parameters of the line are

                     S=          0 e-           .             (2.171)

                              e  -  0

Shunt Element

The S parameters of the shunt element (Figure 2-15) were developed in
Section 2.3.5. In a slightly different form these are

S11 = S22 = - y               and S12 = S21 = 2 ,             (2.172)
               (y + 2)                             (y + 2)

where y = Y /Y0 is the admittance normalized to the system reference
admittance (Y0 = 1/Z0).

Series Element
The S parameters of the series element (Figure 2-21(b)) are

     S11 = S22 = z               and S12 = S21 = 2 ,          (2.173)
                     (z + 2)                       (z + 2)

where z = Z/Z0 is the normalized impedance.

2.6 T or Chain Scattering Parameters of Cascaded
       Two-Port Networks

The T parameters, also known as chain scattering parameters, are a
cascadable form of scattering parameters. They are similar to regular S
parameters and can be expressed in terms of the a and b root power waves
or traveling voltage waves. Two two-port networks, A and B, in cascade
are shown in Figure 2-22. Here (A) and (B) are used as superscripts to
distinguish the parameters of each two-port network, but the subscripts A
and B are used for matrix quantities. Since

               a2(A) = b1(B) and b2(A) = a1(B),               (2.174)
32                     STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

Figure 2-22: Two cascaded
two-ports.

                         it is convenient to put the a and b parameters in cascadable form, leading to
                         the following two-port chain matrix or T matrix representation (with respect
                         to Figure 2-18):

                       a1 b1 = T11 T12 T21 T22         b2 a2 ,                (2.175)

    where the T matrix or chain scattering matrix is

                               T = T11 T12 T21 T22 .                          (2.176)

    T is very similar to the scattering transfer matrix (ST) of Section 2.3.7. The
    only difference is the ordering of the a and b components. You will come
    across both forms, so be careful that you understand which is being used.
    Both forms are used for the same function--cascading two-port networks.
    The relationships between T and S are given by

                   -1                      -1                  -1         -1
                                                                   T22 - T21T11 T12
    T=        S21                -S21 S22      S=     T21T11              -1         .
                                                                          -T11 T12
            -1                             -1                  -1

          S21 S11      S12 - S11S21 S22                   T11

                                  (2.177)                                     (2.178)

    For a two-port network, using Equations (2.174) and (2.175),

          a1(A)        b2(A)      and          a1(B)               b2(B)
            (A) = TA (A)                         (B) = TB (B) , (2.179)
          b1           a2                      b1                  a2

    thus

                           a1(A)                      b2(B)
                              (A) = TATB (B) .                                (2.180)
                           b1                      a2

    For n cascaded two-port networks, Equation (2.180) generalizes to

                       a1(1)                           b2(n)
                         (1) = T1T2 . . . Tn (n) ,                            (2.181)
                       b1                              a2

    and so the T matrix of the cascaded network is the matrix product of the T
    matrices of the individual two-ports.

       Previously, in Section 2.3.7, the scattering transfer parameters were
    introduced. Both the chain scattering parameters and scattering transfer
    parameters are referred to as T parameters. Be careful to denote which form
    is being used.

    What is the input reflection coefficient in terms of chain
    scattering parameters of the terminated two-port to
    the right where the two-port is described by its chain
    scattering parameters.

    Solution:                                      Thus the input reflection coefficient is

    The chain scattering parameter relations are                in = b1 = T21 + T22L .              (2.198)

               a1 = T11 T12       b2 .
               b1     T21 T22     a2               Now consider a transmission line of electrical
                                                   length  and characteristic impedance Z0 (see
    Expanding this matrix equation and using the   the figure b) in cascade with the two-port.

                   a1 = T11b2 + T12Lb2   (2.196)
                   b1 = T21b2 + T22Lb2.  (2.197)

    Multiplying Equation (2.196) by (T21 + T22L)   The input reflection coefficient now is found
    and Equation (2.197) by (T11 + T12L) and then  by first determining the total chain scattering
    subtracting                                    matrix of the cascade:

       (T21 + T22L)a1 = (T11 + T12L)b1.

Thus the input reflection coefficient is now         If the load is now a short circuit L = -1 and

2.6.1 Terminated Two-Port Network

A two-port with Port 2 terminated in a load with reflection coefficient L is
shown in Figure 2-23 and a2 = Lb2. Substituting this in Equation (2.175)
leads to

                a1 = (T11 + T12L)b2 and b1 = (T21 + T22L)b2,

eliminating b2 results in

2.7 Scattering Parameter Two-Port Relationships

2.7.1 Change in Reference Plane

It is often necessary during S parameter measurements of two-port devices

to measure components at a position different from that actually desired.

An example is shown in Figure 2-24(a). From direct measurement the S

parameters are obtained, and thus the T matrix at Planes 1 and 2. However,

                                     
TDUT referenced to Planes 1 and 2 is required. Now,

                                  T = T1 TDUTT2 ,                (2.202)

                                                     under test (DUT) and transmission line

    and so TDUT = T1 -1TT2 -1.                                     (2.203)

    A section of line with electrical length  and port impedances equal to its
    characteristic impedance has

    S=  e    0 e-0  (2.204)                 and T = e -0 .         (2.205)

           -

    Therefore Equation (2.203) becomes

                        T11e-(1+2) T12e-(1-2)
           TDUT =                                       (1+2) ,    (2.206)
                           T21e  (1-2)            T22e

    and then the desired S parameters of the DUT are obtained as

                                S11e21 S12e(1+2)
           SDUT =                                       22 .       (2.207)

    2.7.2 Conversion Between S and ABCD Parameters

    Figure 2-25 can be used to relate the parameters of the two views of the
    network. If both ports have the same reference impedance Z0, then

    V1 I1 = A B V2 C D I2               and b1 b2 = S11 S12 a1 S21 S22 a2 .

    The S parameters are then expressed as

    S11 = A + B/Z0 - CZ0 - D     S12 = 2(AD - BC)                  (2.208)
                                                 

    S21 = 2                      S22 = -A + B/Z0 - CZ0 + D ,
                                                        

    where  = A + B/Z0 + CZ0 + D.                                   (2.209)

    The ABCD parameters can be expressed in terms of the S parameters as

                 A = (1 + S11)(1 - S22) + S12S21                   (2.210)

2.8 Return Loss, Substitution Loss, and Insertion Loss

2.8.1 Return Loss

Return loss, also known as reflection loss, is a measure of the fraction of
power that is not delivered by a source to a load. If the power incident on a
load is Pi and the power reflected by the load is Pr, then the return loss in
decibels is [6, 7]

                                       RLdB = 10 log Pi .                (2.214)
                                                          Pr

The better the load is matched to the source, the lower the reflected power
and hence the higher the return loss. RL is a positive quantity if the reflected
power is less than the incident power. If the load has a complex reflection
coefficient , then

                                        1                                (2.215)
                   RLdB = 10 log 2 = -20 log || .

                                       

That is, the return loss is the negative of the input reflection coefficient
expressed in decibels [8].

   When generalized to a terminated two ports, the return loss is defined with
respect to the input reflection coefficient of the terminated two port [9]. The
two port in Figure 2-26 has the input reflection coefficient

                             in = S11 + LS12S21 ,                        (2.216)
                                             (1 - LS22)

where L is the reflection coefficient of the load. Thus the return loss of a
terminated two-port is

         RLdB = -20 log |in| = -20 log S11 + LS12S21 .                   (2.217)
                                                            (1 - LS22)

If  the  load  is  matched,  i.e.  ZL  =  Z    (the  system   reference  impedance),  then

                                            0

                                   RLdB = -20 log |S11| .                (2.218)

This return loss is also called the input return loss since the reflection
coefficient is calculated at Port 1. The output return loss is calculated looking
into Port 2 of the two-port, where now the termination at Port 1 is just the
source impedance.

    2.8.2 Substitution Loss and Insertion Loss

    The substitution loss is the ratio of the power, iPL, delivered to the load by
    an initial two-port identified by the leading superscript `i', and the power
    delivered to the load, fPL, with a substituted final two-port identified by the
    leading superscript `f '. In terms of generalized scattering parameters with

    reference impedances Z01 at Port 1 and Z02 at Port 2 the substitution loss in
    decibels is (using the results of Example 3.2 and noting that S is referred to
    Z01 and L is referred to Z02)

                             (1 - fS11S )(1 - fS22L) - fS12fS21S L          2
             iPL       iS21                                                   
    LS|dB = fP = 10 log L  fS21 [(1 - iS11S)(1 - iS22L) - iS12iS21SL]  .      

                                                                         (2.219)

    Insertion loss is a special case of substitution loss with particular types of
    initial two-port networks. There are a number of special cases to consider.

    Insertion Loss with an Ideal Adaptor

    Comparing the power delivered to the load with an inserted two-port with
    that delivered with an ideal adaptor is the commonly accepted definition
    of insertion loss [10]. That is, `insertion loss' without qualifications is the
    same as `insertion loss with an ideal adaptor.' An ideal adaptor (as the
    initial two-port network) transforms from the Port 1 reference impedance,
    Z01, to the Port 2 reference impedance, Z02. In terms of generalized S
    parameters the ideal adaptor has i GS11 = 0 = i GS22 (for no reflection),
    iG iG 

       S12 S21 = 1 (for no loss in the adaptor and there is no phase shift),
          iG  iG 

    and S12 = S21 Z01/Z02 (for reciprocity). (If Z01 = Z02 this ideal
    adaptor is the same as a direct connection.) Insertion loss in decibels is, using
    Equation (2.219):

    IL|dB =
                                                                              2

                                                                      S    L  
    10 log
                                     fG                                       
             Z01                     ( S12) (1 - S)
                                                                              

                                                                         (2.220)

       Attenuation is defined as the insertion loss without source and load
    reflections (S = 0 = L) [10], and Equation (2.220) becomes

                                   

    A|dB = 10 log     Z02 1          (= IL|dB with S = 0 = L).           (2.221)
                      Z01 |GS21|2

    where GS21 is that of the final two-port.

    Insertion Loss with Direct Connection

    With normalized S parameters, i.e. Z01 = Z02, the insertion loss

    with an initial direct connection is as given in Equation (2.220). With

    different reference impedances at each port, the initial direct connection
    `i', from Example 2.4, i GS11 = (Z02 - Z01)/(Z02 + Z01), i GS22 =
    iG  iG   iG                                                     iG

network are substituted in Equation (2.219) to determine insertion loss with
a direct connection.

2.8.3 Measurement of Insertion Loss

If the S parameters of a two-port network can be measured it is simple to
calculate the insertion loss of the two-port. However there are situations
where the S parameters cannot be measured and this includes where
there is not a port connection (e.g., the air side of an antenna) and the
system reference impedances differ at the two ports. In this section methods
for measuring insertion loss in such difficult situations is described. If S
parameter measurements are not available the insertion loss of a two-port
network is defined as the ratio, in decibels, of voltages immediately beyond
the point of insertion, before and after insertion [6, 11]. Referring to Figure
2-27(a and b), insertion loss is expressed in decibels as

                                     ILdB = 20 log  E2 ,                         (2.222)
                                                        E2

where E2 is the voltage across the load (ZL) before insertion of the two-port

and  E     is  the  voltage  across  the  load  (ZL)  after  insertion  of  the  two-port.  The

        2

power delivered to the load is proportional to the square of the magnitude of

the voltage across the load, so this definition is equivalent to that described

in section 2.8.2 where

                                     ILdB = 10 log PL ,                          (2.223)
                                                       PT

where PL is the power delivered to the load before the insertion of the two-
port and PT is the power delivered to the load following insertion.

EXAMPLE 2.9 Insertion loss of a two-port in a different reference system

    A 50  attenuator has an attenuation of 3 dB and a return loss of 20 dB. If the attenuator is
    used in a 75  system what is the insertion loss of the attenuator?

    Solution:

    The insertion loss can be calculated using the insertion loss formula in Equation (2.219). To

    apply this the 50  S parameters of the attenuator are needed and then the load and source

    reflection coefficients, L and S respectively, which will be the reflection coefficients of the

    75  load and source impedances referred to 50 . Also note that Z01 = Z02 = 50 . Since

    there are two reference systems the leading superscripts 50 and 75 will be used to distinguish

    them.

    Step 1. Find S and L in the 50  system: S = L = (55 - 50)/(55 + 50) = 0.2000

    Step 2. Find the S parameters in a 50  system. (case 1, assume  S11 =  S21 = 0)

    It is known that 50RL|dB = 20 dB and 50IL|dB = 3 dB. Also an attenuator is symmetrical so

    that  50 S11  =  50     and  50 S12  =  50       Using  Equations  (2.218)  and  (2.221)

                       S22                    S21 .

                     and    |50S11| = |50S22| = 10-50RL|dB/20 = 10-20/20 = 0.1000
                            |50S12| = |50S21| = 10-50IL|dB/20 = 10-3/20 = 0.7080.

    The phases of the S parameters are not known. Assume first (use the leading subscript `1')
    that the phases are 0 and consider alternatives later and then the S parameter matrix is

                                         50          50

                            1S = 50                         =                        .         (2.224)

    From Equation (2.220)

    75 IL 50 (1 - 0.1  0.2) (1 - 0.1  0.2) - 0.7080  0.7080  0.2  0.2 2 dB = 10 log = 2.82 dB.

                                                                                               (2.225)

    Step 3 Four phase assumptions for S11 and S22

    Case 1         S11 =  S22 = 0,  S21 =  S12 = 0                     75       =    2.82  dB
    Case 2         S11 =  S22 = 0,  S21 =  S12 = 180
    Case 3                                                              1 ILdB
    Case 4         S11 =  S22 = 180,  S21 =  S12 = 0                   75
                                                                                =    2.82  dB
                   S11 =  S22 = 180,  S21 =  S12 = 180                  2 ILdB
                                                                       75
                                                                                =    3.53  dB
                                                                        3 ILdB
                                                                       75
                                                                                =    3.53  dB
                                                                        4 ILdB

    Thus just knowing the return loss and insertion loss in one reference system is not enough to

    know the insertion loss in another system without knowing the phases of the S parameters.

EXAMPLE 2.10 Insertion loss calculation using change of reference impedance

       A 50  attenuator has an attenuation of 3 dB and a return loss of 20 dB. If the attenuator is
       used in a 75  system what is the insertion loss of the attenuator?

       Solution:

       This is alternative to the method used in Example 2.9. Using the S parameters of the
       attenuator in Equation (2.224), in a 75  system the S parameters are found using Equation
       (2.138) and noting that 75 = 0.2 is the reflection coefficient of 75  in a 50  system:

               75S11 75S12 =     50                50           50                             50  -1
               75S21 75S22         1S11 - 75 1S12               1 - 75 1S11 -75 1S12
       75S =                         50      50                 50                             50
            =   -0.1 0.7080            1S21    1S22 - 75        -75 1S21 1 - 75 1S22
               0.7080 -0.1

                                 -0.1416      0.9800
                                                           =

       In the 75  system the load and source are matched and using Equation (2.220)                (2.227)
                                1 75 ILdB = 10 log |75S21|2 1 = 10 log |0.7227|2 1 = 2.82 dB.

       which is in agreement with the calculation in Example 2.9, see Equation (2.225).

2.8.4 Minimum Transducer Loss, Intrinsic Attenuation

Another situation often required is determining the minimum possible loss
of a two-port. This is obtained with lossless two-port networks, M1 and
M2 at the input and output of the two-port of interest, M3. M1 and M2 are
adjusted to obtained the minimum possible loss of M3. This is not the same
as designing M1 and M2 to obtain matching. The minimum insertion loss,
also called the intrinsic attenuation, or minimum transducer loss in dB is [12]
(the derivation is involved),

LTM|dB = 10 log  Z02 |1 - S22TM|2 - | (S12S21 - S11S22) TM + S11|2

                 Z01                   |S21|2 (1 - |TM|2)

                                                                    (2.228)

where the S parameters are of M3 Z01 and Z02 are the real reference
impedances at ports 1 and 2 respectively, and

                 TM = B 1  1 - 2|A| ,                              (2.229)
                            2A                   B

where                 A  =  S22  +        (S12S21  -   S11S22)      (2.230)
and                                                                 (2.231)
                                     S11

               B = 1 - |S11|2 + |S22|2 - |S12S21 - S11S22|2.

The intrinsic attenuation is a useful metric when a device is being developed
and has not yet been optimally matched.

   Other insertion loss concepts are comparison loss, mismatch loss, and
conjugate mismatch loss, see [10].

    2.9 Scattering Parameters and Directional Couplers

    Directional couplers were described in Section 5.8 of [13] but described
    without the use of S parameters. A directional coupler with ports defined
    as in Figure 2-28, and with the ports matched (so that S11 = 0 = S22 = S33 =
    S44), has the following scattering parameter matrix:

                                0 T 1/C 1/I                                               (2.232)
                          S = 1/C 1/I 0 T   T 0 1/I 1/C .

                                  1/I 1/C T 0

    There are many types of directional couplers, and the phases of the traveling

    waves at the ports will not necessarily be in phase as Equation (2.232)

    implies. When the phase difference between traveling waves entering at Port
    1 and leaving at Port 2 is 90, Equation (2.232) becomes

                                0 -T 1/C 1/I                                              (2.233)
                          S = 1/C 1/I 0 -T  -T 0 1/I 1/C  .

                                  1/I 1/C -T 0

EXAMPLE 2.11 Identifying Ports of a Directional Coupler

    A directional coupler has the following S parameters:

               0           0.9   0.001                      0.1 
         S =  0.001  0.9    0     0.1                      0.9  0.001  .
                           0.1     0
                    0.1   0.001   0.9                        0

    (a) What are the through (i.e., transmission) paths? Identify two paths. That is, identify the
         pairs of ports at the ends of the through paths.
         First note that the assignment of ports to a directional coupler is arbitrary. So the
         S parameters need to be considered to figure out how the ports are related. The S
         parameters relate the forward-traveling waves to the backward-traveling waves and this
         leads to the required understanding, thus

     V1-   V1+   0                0.9                      0.001          0.1   V1+ 
     V - 2   V + 2   0.9           0                        0.1                V2+
     - =S + =                     0.1                        0    0.001             
                                 0.001                      0.9                     
     V3   V3   0.001                                                      0.9   V + 3  .
    V4-  V4+                                                                   V4+
                          0.1                                             0

    Writing the S parameters out this way makes it easier to identify the largest backward-
    traveling waves for each of the inputs at Ports 1, 2, 3, and 4. The backward-traveling
    wave will leave the directional coupler and the inputs will be forward-traveling waves.
    Consider Port 1, the largest backward-traveling wave is at Port 2, and so Ports 1 and 2
    define one of the through paths. The other through path is between Ports 3 and 4.
    So the through paths are 1-2 and 3-4.
MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                                   43

(b) What is the coupled port for the signal entering Port 1?

The coupled port is identified by the port with the largest backward-traveling signal not

including the port at the other end of the through path. For Port 1 the coupled port is

Port 4.

(c) What is the coupling factor?

                                          V1+ 1
                                   C = - = = 10 = 20 dB.

                                         V4 0.1

(d) What is the isolated port for the signal entering Port 1?

The isolated port is Port 3. The backward-traveling wave at this port is the smallest given

an input at Port 1.

(e) What is the isolation factor?

                                     V1+ 1
                       I= - =                     = 1000 = 60 dB.
                                     V3 0.001

(f) What is the directivity factor?

The directivity factor indicates how much stronger the signal is at the coupled port

compared to the isolated port for a signal at the input. For an input at Port 1, the

directivity factor is                V4- 0.1

                       D= - =                     = 100 = 40 dB.
                                     V3 0.001

As a check D = I/C = 1000/10 = 100.

(g) Draw a schematic of the directional coupler.

There are four ways to draw it depending on which port is chosen to be the input port
(see Figure 2-29).

2.10 Summary

There are several network parameters used with RF and microwave circuits.
Which is used depends on which makes the task of visualizing circuit
operation more clear, which makes analyzing circuits more convenient, and
which makes design easier.

   Scattering parameters are parameters that are almost exclusively used
by RF and microwave engineers. They describe power flow and traveling
waves and are essential to describing distributed circuits. Much of RF and
microwave engineering is concerned with managing the signal-to-noise
power ratio and with power efficiency. It is therefore natural to work with
parameters that directly relate to power flow. RF and microwave design
is characterized by conceptual insight and it is essential to use parameters

and graphical representations that are close to the physical world. Scattering
parameters have very natural graphical representations, as will be seen in
the next chapter.

   The next most important network parameters considered in this chapter
are the ABCD parameters. The special significance of these parameters in
microwave engineering is that they can be used to relate a distributed circuit
to a lumped-element circuit. Many RF designs begin as lumped-element
prototypes that are eventually transformed into electrically equivalent
distributed structures. This equivalence process nearly always involves
ABCD parameters.

3.1 Introduction

The network parameters that directly describe reflected and transmitted
power flow in circuits are scattering (S) parameters. This chapter introduces
two widely used graphical techniques for describing and solving problems
using S parameters. The first graphical technique is signal flow graph
analysis (SFG) and is a graphical way of representing equations and
variables. Simplifying an SFG is the same as solving simultaneous equations
and the equations can be kept in symbolic form. The second graphical
representation is an annotated polar plot of S parameters called a Smith
chart. This is one of the most powerful tools in RF and microwave
engineering and is used to present measured results, to conceptualize
designs, and to intuitively solve problems involving distributed networks.

3.2 Signal Flow Graph

SFGs are convenient ways to graphically represent systems of simultaneous

linear equations [1, 2]. SFGs are used in many disciplines, but they are

particularly useful with RF and microwave circuits.

An SFG represents a linear operation on an input. Consider the inductor

shown in Figure 3-1(a), where the circuit quantities are v and i, and these

are related by the impedance of the inductor sL. The SFG representation of

this relation is given in Figure 3-1(b), with the operation performed written

beside a directed edge. The operation here is simple, multiplying an input

quantity by a scale factor. The edge is directed from the excitation node to the

response node. The algebraic relationship between v and i is, in the Laplace

domain,

                       v = sLi,                      (3.1)
50  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

    and this is exactly how the SFG of Figure 3-1(b) is interpreted. Several linear
    equations are represented in SFG form in Table 3-1.

    3.2.1 SFG Representation of Mathematical Relations

    In this section the basic rules for manipulating SFGs are presented. Think
    back to when you first started working with circuits. The great abstraction
    came about when the physical world was represented graphically as
    connections of circuit elements. Provided that a few simple rules were
    followed, the graphical representation enabled recognition of circuit
    topologies and the selection of appropriate solution strategies (e.g., applying
    the voltage divider rule). When it comes to working with S parameters and
    interconnections of multiport networks, SFGs serve much the same purpose.
    As well, SFG analysis enables the development of symbolic expressions.
    Only a portion of SFG theory is considered here--the aspects relevant to
    manipulating scattering parameter descriptions. Balabanian [3], Abrahams
    and Coverly [4], and Di Stefano et al. [5] provide a more detailed and general
    treatment.

    3.2.2 SFG Representation of Scattering Parameters

    Scattering parameters relate incident and reflected waves:

                        b = Sa,                                           (3.2)

    where a and b are vectors and their ith elements refer to the incident
    and reflected waves, respectively. These relationships can be represented by
    SFGs. Consider the two-port in Figure 3-2(a) described by the equations

    b1 = S11a1 + S12a2  (3.3)                       b2 = S21a1 + S22a2, (3.4)

    which are represented in SFG form in Figure 3-2(b).

    3.2.3 Simplification and Reduction of SFGs

    The power of SFG analysis is that an SFG can be formulated by building up
    the set of equations describing a network by connecting together the SFGs
    of sections. Pattern recognition can be used to identify patterns that can be

reduced and simplified to arrive at a simple relationship between system
input and output. Humans are extraordinarily good at pattern recognition.

Addition

Figure 3-3 depicts SFG addition. Figures 3-3(a and b) denote

                     x2 = G1x1 + G2x1.                        (3.5)

Multiplication

Consider the three cascaded blocks represented by the SFG of Figure 3-4(a).
Here the output of the first block, x2, is described by x2 = G1x1. Now x2 is
the input to the second block with output x3 = G2x2, and so on. The total
response is the product of the individual responses (see Figure 3-4(b)):

                     x4 = G1G2G3x1.                           (3.6)

Commutation

The rules that govern the simplification of SFGs use the fact that each graph
represents a set of simultaneous equations. Consider the removal of the
internal node, b3, in Figure 3-5(a). Here

                     b3 = S31a1 + S32a2 and b4 = S43b3.       (3.7)

Node b3 is called a mixed node (being both input and output) and can be
eliminated, so

                     b4 = S31S43a1 + S32S43a2,                (3.8)

which has the SFG of Figure 3-5(b). In Figure 3-5(b) the node representing the
variable b3 has been eliminated. Thus elimination of a node corresponds to

             the elimination of a variable in the simultaneous. It is sufficient to recognize
             the SFG pattern shown in Figure 3-5(a) and replace it with the SFG of Figure
             3-5(b) to achieve SFG reduction.

             Self-loop

             Recognizing a self-loop and eliminating it is the best example yet of pattern
             identification and direct application of SFG reduction strategies. Consider
             the SFG of Figure 3-6(a), which has a self-loop, which describes The
             equations for this graph are

             Thus  b3 = S32a2, S23a2 = b2, b2 = S21a1 + S23a3, a3 = b3.    (3.9)
                   b3 = S32S21a1 + S32S23b3 and (1 - S32) b3 = S32S21a1,  (3.10)

             where the variable b2 has been eliminated. The graph of Equation (3.10) is
             shown in Figure 3-7(a). The loop attached to node b3 is called a self-loop.
             Such loops are not particularly convenient and can be removed by writing
             Equation (3.10) in the form

                                   b3 = S21S32 a1,                        (3.11)
                                          1 - S23S32

             and the SFG for this equation is shown in Figure 3-7(b). The rule for
             removing self-loops follows from the manner in which Figure 3-7(a) was
             transformed into Figure 3-7(b). As an example, Figure 3-8(a) becomes Figure
             3-8(b) and this can be reduced to the SFG of Figure 3-8(c).

                As a further example, consider the more difficult multiple-loop case
             shown in Figure 3-9(a). This may be redrawn as Figure 3-9(b). The two self-
             loops are added and then the graph reduces to that in Figure 3-9(c).

EXAMPLE 3.1 Signal Flow Graph

Draw the SFG of a two-port with a load (at Port 2) having a voltage reflection coefficient of
L, and at Port 1 a source has a reflection coefficient of S. Using SFG analysis, derive an
expression for the input reflection coefficient looking into the two-port at Port 1.

Solution:
The two-port is shown to the right with the load
attached. The input reflection coefficient is in =
b1/a1 and the properties of the source here have no
impact.

 The sequence of SFG manipulations is shown in Figure 3-10 beginning with the SFG in the
top left-hand corner. So the input reflection coefficient is

     in = b1 a = S11 + S21S12L . 1 1 - S22L                   (3.12)

    3.2.4 SFG Model of a Source

    The SFG model, referenced to a possibly complex impedance Z0, of a source

    with a Thevenin equivalent voltage E and impedance ZS is shown in Figure

    3-11(a). In developing this model the circuit shown in Figure 3-11(b) is used

    where the transmission line of infinitesimal length separates the forward
                                                                  +          -

    impedance of Z0, the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. The

    SFG model used with the transmission line-augmented source is shown in

    Figure 3-11(c). The SFG model of Figure 3-11(c) describes

                                        a1 = bs + Sb1.                                          (3.13)

    where the source reflection coefficient S = (ZS - Z0)/(ZS + Z0). The circuit
    equations for Figure 3-11(b) are

                                                                                   V+ V-        (3.14)
                            V1 = E - ISZS = V1+ + V1- and IS = 1 Z - 1 . 0 Z0

    Now, the traveling wave voltages are related to the a and b root power waves
    as (see Equation (3.15))

                            a1 =  V+1                  and b1 =           V-                    (3.15)
                                                                            1.
                                  {Z0}
                                                                          {Z0}

    Then combining Equations (3.14) and (3.15) yields

                            E = V1+ ZS + Z0            - V1    - ZS - Z0

                                           Z0                        Z0

                                                                                V1
                                                                                {Z0}              (3.16)

          Z0 1 E = a1 - b1S.
         {Z0} ZS + Z0

    Comparing Equations (3.13) and (3.16) it is seen that

                                  bs =      Z0 1 E.                                             (3.17)
                                           {Z0} ZS + Z0

    Thus the SFG model of a source is as shown in Figure 3-11(a) where the
    model is shown for a real Z0.

EXAMPLE 3.2 Power Delivered to a Load and Substitution Loss

This example illustrates the method for determining
powers using signal flow graph analysis with gener-
alized S parameters having reference impedances Z01
at Port 1 and Z02 at Port 2. This is then used to de-
termine substitution loss. The substitution loss is the
ratio of the power delivered to a load with an initial
two-port, to the power delivered with the substituted
final two-port network. The SFG elements are shown
on the right with S referred to Z01 and L referred to
Z02 .

Solution:

The SFG manipulations that determine the power delivered to the load are shown in Figure

3-12 where   = S21 ,                 = 1
                  1 - S22L                 1 - S (S11 + S12L)
                                                                                       (3.18)

and b2 = bS = bS S21 1
                             (1 - S22L) {1 - S [S11 + S12S21L/(1 - S22L)]}

            = bS S21                    (1 - S22L)

            (1 - S22L) [(1 - S22L) - S11S(1 - S22L) + S12S21S L]

            = bS S21                                                                   (3.19)
                  1 - S22L - S11S + S11S22S L + S12S21S L

            = bS S21
                  (1 - S11S )(1 - S22L) - S12S21SL

Then the power delivered to the load is (using Equation (2.117))

            PL = 21 |b2|2  1 - |L|2  =  21 |bS S21|2 1 - |L|2                          (3.20)

                                        |(1 - S11S )(1 - S22L) - S12S21SL|  2

The substitution loss, LS, is the ratio of the power delivered to the load by an initial

two-port identified by the leading superscript `i', and the power delivered to the load with

a final two port identified by the leading superscript `f '. In decibels

                     iPL iS21 (1 - fS11S )(1 - fS22L) - fS12fS 2 21S L                 (3.21)
LS |dB = 10 log fP = 10 log L fS21 [(1 - iS11S)(1 - iS22L) - iS12iS21S L]

Substitution loss is used in deriving formulas for insertion loss, see Section 2.8.2.

             3.2.5 Mason's Rule

             Mason's rule is a general procedure for reducing SFGs with multiple loops
             and is a systematic procedure for the reduction of SFGs to a single branch.
             Mason [6] derived the formula with the aim of developing a general method
             for the computer analysis of electrical circuits. First, a number of topology
             definitions must be introduced.

                A path begins at one node and traverses a number of successive edges in
             the direction of the arrows to arrive at the final node or sink. In SFG anal-
             ysis, a path is a forward path, as the successive edges are traversed in the
             direction of the arrows. An open path encounters the same node only once,
             and a closed path (or a loop) ends on the same node at which it is started.
             The product of the transmittances of all edges in a loop is called the loop
             transmittance. Two paths, open or closed, are said to be non-touching paths
             if they have no nodes in common. Similarly, disjoint loops are loops that have
             no nodes in common.

             Mason's rule:
             If T represents the overall graph transfer function and Tk represents the
             transfer function of the kth forward path from source to sink, then

                                          T = 1 Tkk,                                               (3.22)
                                                k

             where  is the determinant of the matrix of coefficients of the equations
             represented by the SFG (usually called the determinant of the graph) and k
             is the determinant of that part of the graph (subgraph) that does not touch
             the kth forward path. The determinant is given by

              = 1 - Pj1 + Pj2 - Pj3 + . . . ,                                                      (3.23)

             j                            j           j

             where the first summation in Equation (3.23) is the sum of the loop transfer
             functions of all the loops in the graph. In the second summation, the products
             of the transfer functions of all pairs of non-touching loops are added. In
             the third summation, the products of the transfer functions of disjoint loops
             taken three at a time are added, and so on. Mason's rule can be quite difficult
             to apply, but any problem that Mason's rule can solve can also be solved
             using multiple applications of SFG manipulations described previously.

EXAMPLE 3.3  Application of Mason's Rule

    Use Mason's rule to reduce the SFG shown in Figure 3-13(a). Here, input node a1 is the
    excitation and the output node b4 is the response. The transmittance T is equal to b4/a1.

    Solution:

    First, consider the determinant of the flow graph. Since all the loops have at least one node
    in common, the expression for the determinant reduces to

              = 1 - Pj1.                                 (3.24)

                                j

    There are three loops identified in Figure 3-13(b) with transmittances A = S21S32S13, B =
    S32S43S24, and C = S21S32S43S14. Thus the sum of the loop transmittances is
GRAPHICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                                       57

          (a)                     (b)                                               (c)

Figure 3-13: Signal flow graph used in Example 3.3 applying Mason's rule: (a) SFG; (b)

                                 Pj1 = S21S32S13 + S32S43S24 + S21S32S43S14              (3.25)
                                                                                         (3.26)
                                            j

and the determinant is given by

                             = 1 - S21S32S13 - S32S43S24 - S21S32S43S14.

This rule works well with the human ability to recognize patterns, in this case loops. There
is only one forward path, identified in Figure 3-13(b), from source a1 to sink b4, given by

                            T1 = S21S32S43.                                              (3.27)

Since all the loops of the graph have nodes that touch T1, then 1 = 1 and

          Tkk = T11 = S21S32S43.                                                         (3.28)
                                                                                         (3.29)
      k

Thus  b4 = T =              S21S32S43 .
      a1        1 - S21S32S13 - S32S43S24 - S21S32S43S14

This can be represented by a single edge from a1 to b4 as shown in Figure 3-13(c).

3.2.6 Summary

SFG reduction can be used with numerical values but the real power comes
from the ability to develop symbolic expressions. In RF and Microwave
engineering these expressions nearly always involve scattering parameters
but they can be used with any sets of equations. Design is best undertaken by
developing symbolic solutions as these enable optimization to be performed
and insights gained as to the significance of parameters.

3.3 Polar Representations of Scattering Parameters

Scattering parameters are most naturally represented in polar form with the
square of the magnitude relating to power flow. In this section a greater
rationale for representing S parameters on a polar plot is presented and this
serves as the basis for a more complicated representation of S parameters on
a Smith chart to be described in the next section.
58    STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

Figure 3-14: A two-port with scattering parameter

matrix S augmented by lines at each port with the line
at Port n having the reference characteristic impedance
at that port, i.e. Z0n and with electrical length (in
radians) of n. The scattering parameter matrix of the
augmented two-port is S.

    3.3.1 Shift of Reference Planes as a S Parameter Rotation

    A polar plot is a natural way to present S parameters graphically. In general
    S parameters are referenced to different characteristic impedances Z0n at
    each port. Adding additional lengths of the lines at each port rotates the S
    parameters. Consider the two-port in Figure 3-14. Here the original two-port

    with scattering parameter matrix S is augmented by lines at each port with

    each having a characteristic impedance equal to the reference impedance.
    The S parameter matrix of the augmented two-port, S, are the same as the
    original S parameter matrix but phase-shifted. That is

      S S      S e-21 S e-(1+2)
      11 12    11                                                12         .
    S = S S =                                                                  (3.30)
               S21e                                      -(1+2)  S22e  -22
      21 22

    The shift in reference planes simply rotates the S parameters. This is one of
    the main reasons why S parameters are commonly plotted on a polar plot.

    3.3.2 Polar Plot of Reflection Coefficient

    The polar plot of reflection coefficient is simply the polar plot of a complex
    number. Figure 3-15 is used in plotting reflection coefficients and is a polar
    plot that has a radius of one. So a reflection coefficient with a magnitude
    of one is on the unit circle. The center of the polar plot is zero so the
    reflection coefficient of a matched load, which is zero, is plotted at the
    center of the circle. Plotting a reflection coefficient on the polar plot enables
    convenient interpretation of the properties of a reflection. The graph has
    additional notation that enables easy plotting of an S parameter on the
    graph. Conversely, the magnitude and phase of an S parameter can be
    easily read from the graph. The horizontal label going from 0 to 1 is used
    in determining magnitude. The notation arranged on the outer perimeter of
    the polar plot is used to read off angle information. Notice the additional
    notation "ANGLE OF REFLECTION COEFFICIENT IN DEGREES" and the
    scale relates to the actual angle of the polar plot. Verify that the 90 point is
    just where one would expect it to be.

       Figure 3-16 annotates the polar plot of reflection coefficient with real and
    imaginary axes and shows the location of the short circuit and open circuit
    points. Note that the reflection coefficient of an inductive impedance is in
    the top half of the polar plot while the reflection coefficient of a capacitive
    impedance is in the bottom half of the polar plot.

       The nomograph shown in Figure 3-17 aids in interpretation of polar
    reflection coefficient plots. The nomograph relates the reflection coefficient
    (RFL. COEFFICIENT),  ( was originally used instead of  and is still
    used with the Smith chart); the return loss (RTN. LOSS) (in decibels); and
    the standing wave ratio (SWR); and the standing wave ratio (in decibels)
    as 20 log(SWR). When printed together with the reflection coefficient polar
    plot (Figures 3-15 and 3-17 combined) the nomograph is scaled properly, but
GRAPHICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                                        59

it is expanded here so that it can be read more easily. So with the aid of a
compass with one point on the zero point of the polar plot and the other at
the reflection coefficient (as plotted on the polar plot), the magnitude of the
reflection coefficient is captured. The compass can then be brought down to
the nomograph to read , the return loss, and VSWR directly.

3.3.3 Summary

This section introduced the plotting of reflection coefficients as a complex
number on a polar plot. The use of angle and magnitude scales make it easy
to plot a complex number in magnitude-angle form but it is also easy to
plot or read-off the complex number in real-imaginary form. Nomographs
also enable return loss and SWR to be developed without calculation. The

coefficient with real, , and imaginary, , axes.
The short circuit  = -1 and open circuit
 = +1 are indicated. The reflection coefficient
is referenced to a reference impedance ZREF .
Thus an impedance ZL has the reflection
coefficient  = (ZL - ZREF)/(ZL + ZREF)).
An interesting observation is that the angle
of  when ZL is inductive, i.e. has a positive
reactance, has a positive angle between 0 and
180 and so  is in the top half of the polar plot.
Similarly the angle of  when ZL is capacitive,
i.e. has a negative reactance, has a negative
angle between 0 and -180 and so  is in the

bottom half of the polar plot.

                         transmission coefficient can be plotted on the same polar plot, i.e. Figure 3-
                         15, as the polar plot is the representation of a complex number.

                     3.4 Smith Chart

                         The Smith chart is a powerful graphical tool used in the design of microwave
                         circuits. Mastering the Smith chart is essential to entering the world of RF
                         and microwave circuit design as all practitioners use this as if it is well
                         understood by others. It takes effort to master but fundamentally it is quite
                         simple combining a polar plot used for plotting S parameters directly, curves
                         that enable normalized impedances and admittances to be plotted directly,
                         and scales that enable electrical lengths in terms of wavelengths and degrees
                         to be read off. The chart has many numbers printed in quite small font and
                         with signs dropped as there is not room.

                            The Smith chart was invented by Phillip Smith and presented in close to its
                         current form in 1937, see [7-10]. Once nomographs and graphical calculators
                         were common engineering tools mainly because of limited computing
                         resources. Only a few have survived in electrical engineering usage, with
                         Smith charts being overwhelmingly the most important.
GRAPHICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                        61

   This section first presents the impedance Smith chart and then the
admittance Smith chart before introducing a combined Smith chart which
is the form needed in design. The Smith chart presents a large amount
of information in a confined space and interpretation, such as applying
appropriate signs, is required to extract values. The Smith chart is a `back-
of-the-envelope' tool that designers use to sketch out designs.

3.4.1 Impedance Smith Chart

The reflection coefficient, , is related to a load, ZL, by

 = ZL - ZREF ,                                              (3.31)
      ZL + ZREF

where ZREF is the system reference impedance. With normalized load
impedance zl = r + x = ZL/ZREF, this becomes

 = r + x - 1 .                                              (3.32)
      r + x + 1

Commonly in network design reactive elements are added either in shunt
or in series to an existing network. If a reactive element is added in series
then the input reactance, x, is changed while the input resistance, r, is held
constant. So superimposing the loci of  (on the S parameter polar plot) with
fixed values of r, but varying values of x (x varying from - to ), proves
useful, as will be seen. Another loci of  with fixed values of x and varying
values of r (r varying from 0 to ) is also useful. The combination of the
reflection/transmission polar plots, the nomographs, and the r and x loci is
called the impedance Smith chart, see Figure 3-18. This is still a polar plot
of reflection coefficient and the arcs and circles of constant and resistance
enable easy conversion between reflection coefficient and impedance.

   The full impedance Smith chart shown in Figure 3-18 is daunting so
discussion will begin with the less dense form of the impedance Smith chart
shown in Figure 3-19(a) which is annotated in Figure 3-19(b). Referring
to Figure 3-19(b), the unit circle corresponds to a reflection coefficient
magnitude of one and hence a pure reactance. Note that there are lines
of constant resistance and arcs of constant reactance. All points in the
top half of the Smith chart have positive reactances and so all reflection
coefficient points plotted in the top half of the Smith chart indicate inductive
impedances. All points in the bottom half of the Smith chart have negative
reactances and so all reflection coefficient points plotted in the bottom half
of the Smith chart indicate capacitive impedances. The horizontal line across
the middle of the Smith chart indicates pure resistance.

   A point on the unit circle indicate that the resistance of the point is zero,
while a reflection coefficient point inside the unit circle indicates a finite
positive resistance.

   One big difference between the less dense form of the impedance Smith
chart, Figure 3-19(a), and the full impedance Smith chart of Figure 3-18 is
that the signs of the reactances are missing in the full impedance Smith chart.
This is simply because there is not enough room and the user must add the
appropriate sign when reading the chart. Thus it is essential that the user
keep the annotations in Figure 3-19(b) in mind. Yet another factor that makes
it difficult to develop essential Smith chart skills.
62  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

Figure 3-18: Impedance Smith chart. Also called a normalized Smith chart since resistances and
reactances have been normalized to the system reference impedance ZREF: z = Z/ZREF.
A point plotted on the Smith chart represents a complex number A. The magnitude of A is
obtained by measuring the distance from the origin of the polar plot (the same as the origin of
the Smith chart in the center of the unit circle) to point A, say using a ruler, and comparing that
to the measurement of the radius of the unit circle which corresponds to a complex number with
a magnitude of 1. The angle in degrees of the complex number A is read from the innermost

EXAMPLE 3.4 Impedance Plotting

      Plot the normalized impedances zA = 1 - 2
      and zB = 0.3 + 0.6 on an impedance Smith
      chart.

      Solution:
      The impedance zA = 1 - 2 is plotted
      as Point A to the right. To plot this, first
      identify the circle of constant normalized
      resistance r = 1, and then identify the arc
      of constant normalized reactance x = -2.
      The intersection of the circle and arc locates
      zA at point A. The reader is encouraged to
      do this with the full impedance Smith chart
     as shown in Figure 3-18. Recall that signs
      of reactances are missing on the full chart.
      As an exercise read off the reflection coeffi-
      cient (the answer is 0.5-0.5 = 0.707 -45).

      The impedance zB = 0.3 + 0.6 is plotted as Point B which is at the intersection of the circle
      r = 0.3 and the arc x = +0.6. Interpolation is required to identify the required circle and arc.
      The reader should do this with the full impedance Smith chart. As an exercise read off the
      reflection coefficient (the answer is -0.268 + 0.585 = 0.644 115).

EXAMPLE 3.5 Impedance Synthesis

    Use a length of terminated transmission line to realize an impedance of
    Zin = 140 .

    Solution:
    The impedance to be synthesized is reactive so the termination must also
    be lossless. The simplest termination is either a short circuit or an open
    circuit. Both cases will be considered. Choose a transmission line with
    a characteristic impedance, Z0, of 100  so that the desired normalized
    input impedance is 140 /Z0 = 1.4, plotted as point B in Figure 3-20.

     First, the short-circuit case. In Figure 3-20, consider the path AB. The termination is a short
    circuit and the impedance of this load is Point A with a reference length of A = 0  (from the
    outermost circular scale). The corresponding reflection coefficient reference angle from the
    scale is A = 180 (from the innermost circular scale labeled `WAVELENGTHS TOWARDS

    THE GENERATOR' which is the same as `wavelengths away from the load'). As the line
    length increases, the input impedance of the terminated line follows the clockwise path
    to Point B where the normalized input impedance is 1.4. (To verify your understanding

    that the locus of the refection coefficient rotates in the clockwise direction, i.e. increasingly
    negative angle, as the line length increases see Section 2.3.3 of [11].) At Point B the reference
    line length B = 0.1515  and the corresponding reflection coefficient reference angle from
    the scale is B = 71.2. The reflection coefficient angle and length in terms of wavelengths
    were read directly off the Smith chart and care needs to be taken that the right sign and
    correct scale are used. A good strategy is to correlate the scales with the easily remembered

    properties at the open-circuit and short-circuit points. Here the line length is

     = B - A = 0.1515 - 0 = 0.1515,                                                            (3.33)

    and the electrical length is half of the difference in the reflection coefficient angles,

     = 21 |B - A| = 21 |71.2 - 180| = 54.4,                                                    (3.34)

    corresponding to a length of (54.4/360) = 0.1511 (the discrepancy with the previously
    determine line length of 0.1515 is small). This is as close as could be expected from using
    the scales. So the length of the stub with a short-circuit termination is 0.1515.

      For the open-circuited stub, the path begins at the infinite impedance point  = +1 and
    rotates clockwise to Point A (this is a 90 or 0.25 rotation) before continuing on to Point B.

    For the open-circuited stub,                                                               (3.35)
                                             = 0.1515 + 0.25 = 0.4015.

    3.4.2 Admittance Smith Chart

    The admittance Smith chart has loci for discrete constant susceptances
    ranging from - to , and for discrete constant conductance ranging from
    0 to , see Figure 3-21. A less dense form is shown in Figure 3-22(a). This
    chart looks like the flipped version of the impedance Smith chart but it is the
    same polar plot of a reflection coefficient so that the positions of the open
    and short circuit remain the same as do the capacitive and inductive halves
    of the Smith chart. In the full version of the admittance Smith chart, Figure 3-
    21, signs have been dropped as there is not room for them. Thus interpreting
    admittances from the chart requires that the user separately determine the
    signs of susceptances. The less dense version, Figure 3-22(a), retains the
    signs making it easier to follow some of the discussions and examples. It is
    important that the user readily understand the annotations on the less dense
    form of the Smith chart, see Figure 3-22(b).
GRAPHICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS  65

Figure 3-20: Design of a short-circuit stub with a normalized input impedance of 1.4. The path
AB is actually on the unit circle but has been displaced here to avoid covering numbers. The
electrical length in wavelengths has been read from the outermost circular scale, and the angle,
, in degrees refers to the angle of the polar plot (and is twice the electrical length).

3.4.3 Combined Smith Chart

The combination of the reflection/transmission polar plots, nomographs,
and the impedance and admittance Smith chart leads to the combined
Smith chart (see Figure 3-23). This color Smith chart is the preferred version
for use in design and the separate impedance and admittance versions
of the Smith chart are rarely used. The combined Smith charts is rich
with information and care is required to identify the lines that correspond
to admittances (specifically lines of constant normalized conductance
and constant normalized susceptances), and the lines that correspond
to impedances (constant normalized resistances and constant normalized

    reactances). The signs of the reactances and susceptible are missing and left
    to the user to add them depending on whether a reflection coefficient point
    is capacitive (in the lower half of the Smith chart and hence susceptances
    are positive and reactances are negative) or whether a point is inductive (in
    the upper half of the Smith chart and hence susceptances are negative and
    reactances are positive). A less dense version of the combined Smith chart,
    with the addition of signs, is shown in Figure 3-24(a).

  EXAMPLE 3.6 Impedance to Admittance Conversion

         Use a Smith chart to convert the impedance z = 1 - 2 to an admittance.

         Solution:
        The impedance z = 1-2 is plotted as Point A in Figure 3-24(b). To read the admittance from
         the chart, the lines of constant conductance and constant susceptance must be interpolated
         from the arcs and circles provided. The interpolations are shown in the figure, indicating a
         conductance of 0.2 and a susceptance of 0.4. Thus

                                                             y = 0.2 + 0.4.

         (This agrees with the calculation: y = 1/z = 1/(1 - 2) = 0.2 + 0.4.)

Adding Reactance and Susceptance

A good amount of microwave design, such as designing a matching network
for maximum power transfer, involves beginning with a load impedance
plotted on a Smith chart and inserting series and shunt reactances, and
transmission lines, to transform the impedance to another value. The
preferred view of the design process is that of a reflection coefficient that
gradually evolves from one value to another. That is, in the case of a series
reactance, the effect is that of a reflection coefficient gradually changing as
the reactances increase from zero to its actual value. The path traced out by
the gradually evolving reflection coefficient value is called a locus. The loci
of common circuit elements added to various loads are shown in Figure 3-
25. For each locus the load is at the start of the arrow with the value of the
element increasing from zero to its actual final value at the arrow head.

    3.4.4 Smith Chart Manipulations

    Microwave design often proceeds by taking a known load and transforming
    it into another impedance, perhaps for maximum power transfer. Smith
    charts are used to show these manipulations. In design the manipulations
    required are not known up front and the Smith chart enables identification
    of those required. Except for particular situations, lossless elements such
    as reactances and transmission lines are used. The few situations where
    resistances are introduced include introducing stability in oscillators and
    amplifiers, and deliberately reduce signals levels. Most of the time
    introducing resistances unnecessarily increases noise and reduces signal
    levels thus reducing critical signal-to-noise ratios.

       The circuit in Figure 3-26 will be used to illustrate the representation of
    manipulations on a Smith chart. The most common view is to consider that
    the Smith chart is a plot of the reflection coefficient at various stages in the
    circuit, i.e., A, B, C , D, and IN. Additionally the load, ZL, is plotted
    and reactances, susceptances, or transmission lines transform the reflection
    coefficient from one stage to the next. Yet another concept is the idea that
    the effect of an element is regarded as gradually increasing from a negligible
    value up to the final actual value and in so doing tracing out a locus which
    ends in an arrow head. This is the approach nearly all RF and microwave
    engineers use. The manipulations corresponding to the circuit are illustrated
    in Figure 3-27. The individual steps are identified in Figure 3-28. The first
    few steps are confined to the top half of the Smith chart which is repeated on
    a larger scale in Figure 3-29 for the first three steps.

    Step 1 L, a, b, c, d, e, f
    The first step is to plot the load ZL on a Smith chart and this is the Point L
    in Figures 3-27-3-29. The reference impedance ZREF is chosen to be 50 , the
    same as the characteristic impedance of the transmission line in the circuit.
    The Smith chart is now known as a 50- Smith chart. This is a common
    choice because then the locus of reflection coefficient variation introduced
    by the line will be a circle centered at the origin of the Smith chart. To plot L
    derive the normalized load impedance zL = ZL/ZREF = 0.3 + 0.6 (future
    numerical values are given in Figure 3-26).

       To plot zL the normalized resistance circle for 0.3 and the normalized

                    reactance arc for +0.3 must be located. The resistance circle is identified

                    from the scale on the horizontal axis of the Smith chart, see the circled value
                    labeled `a'. Locating the +0.3 reactance arc is not as direct as the signs of

                    reactance are missing on the Smith chart. Referring back to Figure 3-19 it is
                    noted that an inductive impedance is in the top half of the Smith chart and
                    so positive reactances are in the top half. Thus the +0.3 reactance arc is in

                    the top half of the Smith chart and the correct arc is identified by `c'. From
                    the curves identified by `a' and `c' the arcs `b' and `d' are drawn with the
                    impedance zL, i.e. point L, at the intersection of the arcs.

                       It is instructive to determine L, the reflection coefficient at L. On the Smith
                    chart the reflection coefficient vector L is drawn from the origin to the point
                    L. L is evaluated by separately determining its magnitude and angle. To
                    determine the magnitude measure the length of the L| vector either using a
                    ruler, a compass, or marking the edge of a piece of paper. Then this length can

                    be compared against the reflection coefficient scale shown at the bottom of
                    Figure 3-27 yielding |L| = 0.644. The angle of L is read by extending the L
                    vector out to the inner most circular scale on the Smith chart. This extension
                    is labeled as e. The angle is read at point `f' as 115. Thus L = 0.644 115.
GRAPHICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS                                                           73

74  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

    Step 2 Add the series reactance XAL, path L to A, g
    In step 2 an inductor with reactance XAL is in series with ZL and the
    reflection coefficient transitions from point L to point A. Now xL = {zL} =
    0.6. To this xAL = 0.6 is added so that the normalized reactance at A is
    xA = xL + xAL = 0.6 + 0.6 = 1.2. The locus of this operation is the arc,
    `g', extending from L with gradually increasing series reactance until the full
    value xAL, at the arrowhead of the locus, is obtained. The procedure is to
    identify the arc of xA = +1.2 reactance and then follow the circle of constant
    resistance (since the resistance is not changing) up to this arc. This operation
    traces out the locus 'g'.

    Step 3 Add the shunt susceptance BBA, path A to B, h
    In step 3 a capacitor with susceptance XBA is in shunt with ZA and
    the reflection coefficient transitions from point A to point B. The locus
    of this operation follows a circle of constant conductance with only they
    susceptance changing. The final value must be calculated as bB = bA + bBA.
    The susceptance bB is read from the graph as -0.784. This value is read
    by following the arc of constant susceptance out to the unit circle where
    a value of 0.784 is read. Note that the arc must be interpolated and that
    the user must realize that the susceptance is negative in the top half of the
    Smith chart so the susceptance must be negative even though a minus sign is
    not shown on the Smith chart. Thus the correct reading for xA is -0.784.
    Now bBA = +0.230 so the locus, `h', of the transition follows the circle
    of constant conductance ending at the (interpolated arc) with susceptance
    bB = ba + bBA = -0.784 + 0.230 = -0.554.

    Step 4 Add the series reactance XCB, path B to C, i
    In step 4 a capacitor with reactance XCB is in series with ZB and the
    reflection coefficient transitions from point B to point C. Now xB is read
    from the graph as +1.603. To this add xCB = -3.600 so that the normalized
    reactance at C is xC = xB + xCB = 1.603 + (-3.600) = -1.997. The locus
    from B to C, path `i', begins at B and follows a circle of constant resistance
    up to the arc with normalized reactance xC = -1.997. This reactance arc
    is in the bottom half of the Smith chart as reactances are negative there
    even though the signs are missing on the labels of the reactance arcs in the
    bottom half of the chart. The locus of this operation is the arc, `g', from L
    with gradually increasing series reactance until the full value zCB, at the
    arrowhead of the locus, is obtained. The procedure is to identify the arc of
    xC = -1.997 reactance and then follow the circle of constant resistance (since
    the resistance is not changing) up to this arc. This traces out the locus 'i'.

    Step 5 Insert the transmission line, path C to D, j
    Step 5 illustrates a different type of manipulation as now there is a
    transmission line and the reflection coefficient transitions from C , i.e. point
    C to the input reflection coefficient of the line D. The locus of this transition
    must be clockwise, i.e. having increasingly negative angle (as discussed
    in Section 2.3.3 of [11]). The electrical length of the transmission line is
     = 83 and the reflection coefficient changes by the negative of twice this
    amount, DC = -2 = -166. The locus is drawn in Figure 3-27 with the
    transmission line gradually increasing in length tracing out a circle which,
    since Z0 = ZREF, is centered at the origin of the Smith cart. The procedure is
    to find the scale value of the angle at point C which is read by drawing a line
    from the origin through C intersecting the reflection coefficient angle scale
GRAPHICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS  75

(the innermost circular scale) yielding C = -50.4 and so D = C +DC =
-50.4 - 166 + 360) = +143.6. The locus from C to D is drawn by first
drawing a line from the origin to the D = -143.6 point on the angle scale.
Then point D will be at the intersection of this line and a circle of constant
radius drawn through C. The locus is shown as path 'j' in Figure 3-27.

Step 6 Add the shunt susceptance BID, path D to I, k
The final step is to add the shunt capacitor with susceptance BID to ZD.
Following the previous procedure bD is read as -2.71 to which bID = 2.71 is
added so that bI = 0 which is just the horizontal line across the middle of the
Smith chart. This line corresponds to zero reactance and zero susceptance.
The locus, path 'k', extends from D to I following the circle of constant
conductance. The final result is that zIN = 1.00 and ZIN = zIN  Z0 = 50 .

Summary

The Smith chart manipulations considered here modified the reflection
coefficient of a load by adding shunt and series reactive elements. The final
result of the circuit manipulations is that the input impedance is ZIN =
50 . If the source has a Thevenin source impedance of 50  then there is
maximum power transfer to the circuit. Since all of the elements in the circuit
manipulations are lossless this means that there is maximum power transfer
from the source to the load ZL. Of course fewer circuit manipulations could
have been used to achieve this result. Note that manipulations resulting from
adding series and/or shunt resistances were not considered. It is rare that
this would be desired as that simply means that power is absorbed in the

                   Design Environment Project File: RFDesign Shorted Microstrip Line Smith.emp

         The example in Section 3.5.2 of [11] calculated the input reflection coefficient, , of the
        shorted microstrip line on alumina substrate shown in Figure 3-30. The line had low loss
         and so  was always close to 1. The microstrip line was designed to be 50  and the locus of
         with respect to frequency of the low loss line is plotted on a 50- Smith chart in Figure 3-
        31(a). Plotting  on a 50- Smith chart indicates that the reflection coefficient was calculated
         with respect to 50 . At a very low frequency, 0.1 GHz is the lowest frequency here, the locus
         of the reflection coefficient is very close to  = -1, identifying a short circuit. As the electrical
         length increases, in this case the frequency increases as the physical length of the line is fixed,
         the locus of the reflection coefficient moves clockwise, hugging the unity reflection coefficient
         circle. At the highest frequency, 30 GHz, the reflection coefficient is less than 1 and the locus
         starts moving in from the unity circle. It is interesting to see what happens with a high-loss
         line, and this is achieved by changing the loss tangent, tan , of the substrate from 0.001 to
        0.1. The locus of the reflection coefficient of the high-loss line is shown in Figure 3-31(b). Loss
         increases as the electrical length of the line increases and the locus of the reflection coefficient
         traces out a clockwise inward spiral.

    3.4.5 An Alternative Admittance Chart

    Design often requires switching between admittance and impedance. So it is
    convenient to use the colored combined Smith chart shown in Figure 3-23.
    Monochrome charts were once the only ones available and an impedance
    Smith chart was used for admittance-based calculations provided that
    reflection coefficients are rotated by 180. This form of the Smith chart is not
    used now.

    3.4.6 Expanded Smith Chart

    Another form of the Smith chart is the expanded Smith chart shown in
    Figure 3-32. This is used to plot reflection coefficients of loads with a negative
    resistance that have a reflection coefficient magnitude greater than one. An
    oscillator, for example, presents a negative resistance to a resonator. It is also
    used to plot transmission parameters that have a magnitude greater than
    one, such as the forward transmission parameter, S21, of a transistor.

    3.4.7 Summary

    The Smith chart is the most powerful of tools used in RF and Microwave
    Design. Design using Smith charts will be considered in other chapters but
    at this stage the reader should be totally conversant with the techniques
    described in this section.

3.5 Transmission Lines and Smith Charts

The locus of a transmission line on a Smith chart is a circle. When
the characteristic impedance of the line is equal to the system reference
impedance this circle is centered at the origin of the Smith chart. The main
purpose of this section is to consider the situation where the characteristic
impedance and the system reference impedance differ.

3.5.1 Bilinear Transform

Mathematically the input reflection coefficient of a terminated transmission
line of characteristic impedance Z02 is referenced to a system impedance
Z01. The mathematics describing this is based on the bilinear transform. The
generalized bilinear transform of two complex numbers z and w is

w = Az + B ,                (3.36)
      Cz + D

where A, B, C, and D are constants1 that may themselves be complex. This is
of interest in dealing with reflection coefficients where w and z are reflection
coefficients and A, B, C, and D describe the two-port network connected to a
load with a complex reflection coefficient z, and w is the reflection coefficient
looking into the network. The special property of the bilinear transform is
that a circle in the complex plane (here the locus of z) is mapped onto another
circle (here the locus of w) in the complex plane. (This is shown in Section
1.A.14 of [11].)

1 These are not the cascadable ABCD parameters, but simply the coefficients commonly used
  with bilinear transforms.

                            forward transmission parameter, S21,
                            of a transistor is shown with the ar-
                            rows in the direction of increasing fre-
                            quency. The unit circle of a conven-
                            tional Smith chart is shown

    3.5.2 Reference Impedance Change as a Bilinear Transform

    In Figure 3-33 a fixed load terminates a transmission line of characteristic
    impedance Z01 and the input reflection coefficient is in. As will be shown,
    the locus of in, normalized to any system impedance, is a circle on the
    complex plane as the electrical length of the line increases. The electrical
    length of the line increases as the frequency increases with the physical
    length of the line held constant, or as the physical length of the line increases
    with the frequency held constant.

       From Equation ((2.60)) of [11] the reflection coefficient of a load ZL
    referenced to Z01 is

    L,Z01 = ZL - Z01                                           (3.37)
                 ZL + Z01

    and the input reflection coefficient referenced to Z01 is

    in,Z01 = L,Z01e-2,                                         (3.38)

    where  =  is the electrical length of the line. As  increases from zero,
    in,Z01 plotted on a polar chart traces out a circle rotating in the clockwise
    direction. The important result that will be developed in this section is that
    when the input reflection coefficient is referenced to another impedance, the
    new reflection coefficient will also trace out a circle. The development of
    in,Z02 (the input reflection coefficient referred to Z02) begins by calculating
    the input impedance of the line (in Figure 3-33):

    Zin = Z01 1 + in,Z01                                       (3.39)
                 1 - in,Z01

    so that the reflection coefficient referenced to Z02 is

    in,Z02 = Zin - Z02 = (Zin - Z02)(1 - in,Z01)               (3.40)
                 Zin + Z02 (Zin + Z02)(1 - in,Z01)

             = (Z01 + Z02)in,Z01 + (Z01 - Z02)
                 (Z01 - Z02)in,Z01 + (Z01 + Z02)

             = in,Z01 + B = Ain,Z01 + B .
                 Bin,Z01 + 1 Cin,Z01 + D

    This mapping has the form of a bilinear transform (Equation (3.36)) with

    A = 1 = D,  B = Z01 - Z02 = C.                             (3.41)
                      Z01 + Z02

    Since Equation (3.40) is a general bilinear transform, if the locus of in,Z01 is
    a circle, then the locus of in,Z02 is also a circle.

EXAMPLE 3.8 Reflection Coefficient, Reference Impedance Change

In the circuit to the right, a 50- lossless line is terminated
in a 25- load. Plot the locus, with respect to the length of
the line, of the reflection coefficient looking into the line,
referencing it first to a 50- reference impedance and then
to a 75- reference impedance.

Solution:

Let the input reflection coefficient referenced to a 50- system be in,50, and when it is
referenced to 75- it is in,75. In the 50- system the reflection coefficient of the load is

L,50 = ZL - 50 = 25 - 50 = -0.3333                (3.42) and in,50 = L,50e-2 , (3.43)
           ZL + 50 25 + 50

where  = () is the electrical length of the line. The locus, with respect to electrical length,

of in,50 is plotted in Figure 3-34 as the length  ranges from 0 to /8 to /2, and completes

the circle at /2. Now

                                                Zin = 50 1 + in,50 ,   (3.44)
                                                            1 - in,50

so that the 75- reflection coefficient is

                            in,75 = Zin - 75 .                         (3.45)
                                        Zin + 75

The locus of this reflection coefficient is plotted on a polar plot in Figure 3-35. This locus is
the plot of in,75 as the electrical length of the line, , is varied from 0 to . The center of the
circle in Figure 3-35 is taken from the chart and determined to be -0.177.
80                   STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

                A circle is defined by its center and its radius, and Equations ((1.239)) and
             ((1.240)) of [11], enable the circles for the locus of in,Z01 and in,Z02 to be
             related. in,Z01 has a center CZ01 and a radius RZ01:

                     CZ01 = 0 and RZ01 = |L,Z01| .                                                    (3.46)

             In Equation ((1.239)) of [11] CZ01 replaces the center Cz and |L,Z01| takes the

             place of the radius Rz. Similarly the center of the Z02 circle, CZ02, replaces

             Cw and the radius of the Z02 circle, RZ02, replaces Rw. So the locus of the

             reflection coefficient referenced to Z02 is described by a circle with center and

             radius

             CZ02 =  B - A/C  2+  A                     (3.47)  RZ02 = 1 - |CL,Z01|2 (BC - A)L,Z01 .  (3.48)

                     1 - |CL,Z01| C

                Since, from Equation (3.41), A = 1 and B = C (B is given in Equation
             (3.41)), this further simplifies to

             CZ02 =  B - 1/B  2+  1                                     (B2 - 1)L,Z01
                                                        (3.49)  RZ02 =                2.              (3.50)
                     1 - |BL,Z01| B                                     1 - |BL,Z01|

                So the locus (with respect to frequency) of the input reflection coefficient
             of a terminated transmission line (of characteristic impedance Z01) is a circle
             no matter what normalization impedance is used and the center of the circle
             will be on the real axis, the horizontal axis of the Smith chart.

EXAMPLE 3.9  Center of Reflection Coefficient Locus

    In Example 3.8 the locus of the input reflection coefficient referenced to 75  was plotted
    for a 50- line terminated in a load with reflection coefficient (in the 50- system) of -1/3.
    Calculate the center of the input reflection coefficient when it is referenced to 75 .

    Solution:

    The center of the reflection coefficient normalized to Z01 is zero, that is, C50 = 0. From
    Equation (3.49), the center of the reflection coefficient normalized to Z02 = 75  is

    where  C75 = 1 - |BL,50|2 B - 1/B + 1B ,                                          (3.51)
    So                                                                                (3.52)
             B = Z01 - Z02 = 50 - 75 = -0.2.                                          (3.53)
                    Z01 + Z02 50 + 75

           C75 = 1 - (0.2/3)2 -0.2 + 5 - 5 = -0.17857,

    which compares favorably to a center of -0.177 determined manually from the polar plot in
    the previous example.

             3.5.3 Reflection Coefficient Locus

             The direction of the locus of the input reflection coefficient of a terminated
             transmission line is always clockwise with increasing frequency, even if the
             Smith chart uses a reference or normalization impedance different from the
             characteristic impedance of the line. In Figure 3-36, Z01 is the characteristic
             impedance of the line and Z02 is the normalization impedance. The center
             of the circle of the reflection coefficient normalized to Z02 is to the left of the
             origin if Z02 > Z01, and to the right of the origin if normalized to Z02 < Z01,
             but always on the real axis.

                                                             is with respect to the electrical length of the line
                                                             and the arrows show the direction of rotation
                                                             of the reflection coefficient. (Note that for the
                                                             same terminating impedance the radii will also
                                                             change, but this is not shown here.)

3.5.4 Summary

Smith charts are indispensable tools for RF and microwave engineers. Even
with the ready availability of CAD programs. Smith charts are generally
preferred for portraying measured and calculated data because of the easy
interpretation of S parameters. With experience, the properties of circuits can
be inferred. Also, with experience they are an invaluable design tool enabling
the designer to see the beginning and endpoints of a design and infer the type
of circuitry required to go from start to finish.

3.6 Summary

Graphical representations of power flow enable RF and microwave
engineers to quickly ascertain circuit performance and arrive at qualitative
design decisions. Humans are very good at processing graphical information
and seeing patterns, anomalies, and the path from one point to another.
Two powerful techniques were introduced in this chapter that provide this
insight. These are the signal flow graph and the Smith chart. Signal flow
graphs enable engineers to solve algebraic problems without using algebraic
equations. Signal flow graphs are also a convenient way to develop symbolic
expressions. Developing these expressions using algebraic manipulations
alone is error prone.

   The Smith chart is a richly annotated polar plot for representing reflection
and transmission coefficients, and more generally, scattering parameters.
The Smith chart representation of scattering parameter data aligns very
well with the intuitive understanding of an RF designer. The experienced
RF designer is intrinsically familiar with the Smith chart and prefers that
circuit performance during design be represented on one. Representing
something as simple as an extension of a line length to a two-port is
quite complex if described using network parameters other than scattering
parameters. However, with scattering parameters this extension results in a
change of the angle of a scattering parameter, or on a Smith chart an arc.
Scattering parameters relate directly to power flow. So from a Smith chart an
82             STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

experienced designer can ascertain the effect of circuit design on power flow,
which then relates to signal-to-noise ratio and power gain. The Smith chart
will be an essential tool in many of the topics considered in later chapters.

4.1 Introduction

At microwave frequencies it is almost never possible to measure voltage and
current directly and so it is not possible to measure z and y parameters, and
most other network parameters, directly. However S parameters are easy to
measure as they are based on power flow and instead of relying on short
and open circuit terminations, their definitions require matched loads which
minimize reflections and also ensure that circuits are stable.

4.2 Measurement of Scattering Parameters

S parameters are measured using a network analyzer called an automatic
network analyzer (ANA), or more commonly a vector network analyzer
(VNA).

4.2.1 Vector Network Analyzer

The VNA is based on separating the forward- and backward-traveling
voltage waves using a directional coupler. The separated traveling waves are
then the total voltages on the coupled lines of the directional coupler. They
are down-converted to perhaps 100 kHz and then sampled by an analog-to-
digital converter [1]. Schematics of modern VNAs are shown in Figures 4-1
and 4-2 and comprise

   1. A frequency synthesizer for stable generation of a sinewave.
   2. A display plotting the S parameters in various forms, with a Smith

       chart being most commonly used.
   3. An S parameter test set. This device generally has two measuring ports
90              STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

                                 so that when required S11, S12, S21, and S22 can all be determined
                                 under program control. The main components are switches and
                                 directional couplers. Directional couplers separate the forward- and
                                 backward-traveling wave components. Network analyzers with more
                                 than two ports--four-port network analyzers are popular--have more
                                 switches and directional couplers. The mixers map the amplitude and
                                 phase of the RF signal to the IF, commonly around 100 kHz, which is
                                 sampled by the ADC.
                             4. A computer controller used in correcting errors and converting the
                                 results to the desired form.

                         For RF measurements up to a few tens of gigahertz, most of these functions
                         are incorporated in a single instrument. At higher frequencies and with older
                         equipment multiple units are used. An outline of such a system is shown in
                         Figure 4-3(a) and a photograph in Figure 4-3(c). In the foreground of Figure
                         4-3(c) is a probe station that has a stage for an IC or RF circuit board and
                         mounts for micropositioners to which microprobes are attached. The vertical
                         tube-shaped object is a microscope-mounted camera.
                         The probes are mounted on micromanipulators such as those shown in
                         Figure 4-4. These provide precision positioning with x-y-z movement and an
                         axis rotation to accommodate probing on substrates that are not completely
                         flat.

Probing elements required for on-wafer measurements are shown in Figure
4-5. Figure 4-5(a) shows a single RF probe that is essentially an extended
coaxial line. Figure 4-5(c) shows a microprobe making a connection to a
transmission line on an IC and the lower image in Figure 4-5(b) shows
greater detail of the contact area.
A typical microprobe is based on a micro coaxial cable with the center
conductor (carrying the signal) extended a millimeter or so to form a needle-
like contact. Two other needle-like contacts are made by attaching short
extensions to the outer conductor of the coaxial line on either side of the
signal connection (see the top image in Figure 4-5(b)). Such probes are called

ground-signal-ground (GSG) probes and transition from a coaxial cable to
an on-wafer CPW line, providing a smooth transition of the EM fields from
those of a coaxial line to those of the CPW line. The on-wafer pads can be as
small as 50 탆 on a side.
Measurement using CPW probes and manipulators enables repeatable
measurements to be made from DC to above 100 GHz. Such measurements
require repeatability of probe connections that are better than 1 탆. When
the DUT has microstrip connections, it is necessary to use a CPW-to-
microstrip adapter, as shown in Figure 4-6. The layout of a suitable adapter
is shown in Figure 4-6(a). In Figure 4-6(c and d) two adaptors are shown
in use in the characterization of a microwave transistor. GSG probes contact
the adapters and the grounds are connected to the backside metalization by
vias. Calibration uses the microstrip transmission line calibration substrates
shown in Figure 4-6(b).

4.3 Calibration

The components of a microwave measurement system introduce substantial
errors. Fortunately a network analyzer is a very stable instrument and the
errors are faithfully reproduced. This means that a calibration procedure can
be used to determine the errors and then the errors can be removed from raw
measurements of the device being measured, which, by convention, is called

    Figure 4-7: Two-port error network with three different calibration loads.

    the device under test (DUT). All that is needed to determine the parameters
    of a two-port are three precisely known loads.
    Calibration of the measurement system is critical, as the effect of cabling and
    connectors can be more significant than that of the device being measured.
    The process of removing the effect of cabling and connectors is called
    de-embedding. Ideally, perfect short, open, and matched loads would be
    available, but these can only be approximated, and numerous schemes have
    been developed for alternative ways of calibrating an RF measurement
    system. In some cases, for example, in measuring integrated circuits using
    what is called on-wafer probing, it is very difficult to realize a good match.
    A solution is to use calibration standards that consist of combinations
    of transmission line lengths and repeatable reflections. These calibration
    procedures are known mostly by combinations of the letters T, R, and L such
    as through-reflect-line TRL [3] (which relies on a transmission line of known
    characteristic impedance to replace the match); or through-line (TL), [4, 5]
    (which relies on symmetry to replace the third standard).

    4.3.1 One-Port Calibration

    In one-port measurements the desired reflection coefficient cannot be
    obtained directly. Instead, there is effectively an error network between the
    measurement plane at the load and the ideal internal network analyzer
    port. The network model [6] of the measurement system is shown in Figure
    4-7 together with three ideal calibration standards. Calibration, here, is
    concerned with determining the S parameters of the error two-port.
    Various calibration schemes have been developed, some of which are better
    in particular measurement environments, such as when measuring on-chip
    structures. Calibration schemes share certain commonalities. One of these
    is that the errors can be represented as a two-port (or several two-ports)
    that exists between an effective reference plane internal to the measurement
    equipment and the reference plane at the device to be measured. This
    device is commonly called the device under test (DUT). Known standards
    are placed at the device reference plane and measurements are made. The
    concept is illustrated by considering the determination of the S parameters
    of the two-port shown in Figure 4-7. With Z1 being a matched load, the input
    reflection coefficient 1 is S11:

                                 S11 = 1.                                       (4.1)

    The other commonly used calibration loads are Z2 = 0 (a short circuit) and
    Z3 =  (an open circuit). In calibration precision shorts and opens are

detailed calibration procedure. From these, S12 = S21 and S22 can be derived:

                        2 - 3                                                                                               (4.3)

                                                                                                               1

and S21 = S12 = [(3 - S11)(1 - S22)] 2 .

The error two-port modifies the actual reflection coefficient of a DUT to a
warped (but calibrated) reflection coefficient according to Equation (3.12).
In Equation (3.12), the load reflection coefficient, L, is a complex number
that is scaled, rotated, and shifted before being presented at in. Moreover,
circles of reflection coefficient are mapped to circles on the warped complex
plane; that is, the ideal Smith chart is mapped to a warped Smith chart. Here
the actual load reflection coefficient, L, is warped to present a measured
reflection coefficient, M , to the internal network analyzer. Calibration
can be viewed as a mapping operation from the complex plane of raw
measurements to the complex plane of ideal measurements, as shown in
Figure 4-8(a). That is, calibration develops the required mapping. Figure 4-
8(b-e) shows how the corrected mapping is developed using different sets of
calibration standards. The mapping operation shown in Figure 4-8(b) uses
the short, open, and match loads. This one-port calibration procedure is
called open-short-load or SOL calibration and is available as a calibration
algorithm in all network analyzers. The three standards are well distributed
over the Smith chart and so the mapping can be extracted with good
precision. While ideal short, open, and match loads are not available, if
the terminations are well characterized then appropriate corrections can be
made. The mapping in the one-port case is embodied in the extracted S

             parameters of the two-port.
             Figure 4-9(a) shows the longitudinal section of a precision coaxial open. The
             key feature is that the outer coaxial conductor is extended and the fringing
             capacitance at the end of the center conductor can be calculated analytically.
             Thus the precision open is not a perfect open, but rather an open that
             can be modeled as a small capacitor whose frequency variation is known.
             Figure 4-8(c) uses offset shorts (i.e., short-circuited transmission lines of
             various lengths). This circumvents the problem of difficult-to-produce open
             and matched loads. Care is required in the choice of offsets to ensure that
             the mapping can be determined accurately. The calibration scheme shown
             in Figure 4-8(d) introduces a known load. The mapping cannot be easily
             extracted here, but in some situations this is the only option. Figure 4-8(e)
             introduces a new concept in calibration with the use of a sliding matched
             load such as that shown in Figure 4-9(b). A perfect matched load cannot be
             produced and there is always, at best, a small resistance error and perhaps
             parasitic capacitance. When measured, the reflection will have a small offset
             from the origin. If the matched load is moved, as with a sliding matched
             load, a small circle centered on the origin will be traced out and the center of
             this circle is the ideal matched load.

             4.3.2 De-Embedding

             The one-port calibration described above can be repeated for two ports,
             resulting in the two-port error model of Figure 4-10(a), the error model for
             correcting two-port measurements. Using the chain scattering matrix (or T
             matrix1) introduced in Section 2.6, the T parameter matrix measured at the
             internal reference planes of the network analyzer is

                                     TMEAS = TATDUTTB ,                                 (4.4)

             where TA is the T matrix of the first error two-port, TDUT is the T matrix
             of the device under test, and TB is the T matrix of the right-hand error two-
             port. Manipulating Equation (4.4) leads to TDUT:

                                     TA-1TMEASTB-1 = TA-1TATDUTTB TB-1                  (4.5)
                                                 TDUT = TA-1TMEASTB-1,                  (4.6)

             from which the S parameters of the DUT can be obtained.

             4.3.3 Two-Port Calibration

             The VNA architecture introduced in 1968 and still commonly used today
             is shown in Figure 4-1. A key component of the system is the test set
             that comprises mechanical microwave switches and directional couplers
             that selectively couple energy in either the forward- or backward-traveling
             waves. Many modern VNAs use multiple mixers and electronic switches to

             1 Note that there are several T matrices, so it necessary to be specific.

eliminate the need for mechanical switches. Operation is similar. Returning
to the architecture of Figure 4-1, this architecture supports a single signal
source and a single test port at which the RF signal to be measured is mixed
down to a low frequency, typically 100 kHz, where it is captured by an ADC.
The mixing component is called the frequency converter, and it mixes the RF
signal with a version of the original RF signal offset in frequency to produce
a low-frequency version of the RF signal. This has the same phase as the
98                      STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

    RF signal and an amplitude that is linearly proportional to the RF signal.
    When Hackborn introduced this system in 1968 [1], he also introduced the
    8-term error model shown in Figure 4-10(a). This is an extension of the one-
    port error model discussed in Section 4.3.1, with a two-port capturing the
    measurement errors to each port.
    Closer examination of the VNA system of Figure 4-1 indicates that the signal
    path varies for each of the four scattering parameters for a DUT. Another
    imperfection that is not immediately obvious is that there is leakage in the
    system so that Ports 1 and 2 are coupled by a number of mechanisms that
    do not involve transmission of the signal through the DUT. Leakage is due
    to finite isolation in the mixers and direct coupling between probes used
    to make contact at Ports 1 and 2, among other possible causes. The first
    person to identify this was Shurmer [9] in 1973, leading eventually to the
    12-term error model [7, 10] shown in Figure 4-10(b). Calibration yields the
    error parameters, and the S parameters of the DUT are found as follows:

    The most complete model is the 16-term error model introduced in 1979
    and shown in Figure 4-10(c), which incorporates a different model for each
    parameter and fully captures the various signal paths resulting from the
    different switch positions [8]. Nevertheless, the 12-term error model is the
    one most commonly used in microwave measurements and is sufficient to
    reliably extract the desired S parameters of the DUT from the raw VNA
    measurements. This process of extracting the de-embedded parameters is
    call de-embedding, or less commonly, unterminating.
    The 12-term error model models the error introduced by leakage or crosstalk
    internal to the network analyzer. The 16-term error model captures the
    leakage or crosstalk of the 12-term error model, but in addition includes
    switch leakage that results in error signals reflecting from the DUT and
    leaking to the transmission port as well as common-mode leakage [11].
    This method is called two-port 16-term singular value decomposition (SVD)
    calibration, as the equations are solved in a least squares sense using the
    singular value decomposition method [11]. In a coaxial environment, the
GRAPHICAL MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENTS                            99

extra leakage terms are small, provided that the switches have high isolation.
However, in wafer probing where direct coupling between the probes can be
appreciable, the transmission-related leakage can be important and the 16-
term error model captures errors that the 12-term error model does not.
These error models and the sequence of measurements to extract them are
included in the VNA control software. The user must select which to use.

Coaxial Two-Port Calibration

If the DUT has coaxial connectors then precision open, short, and matched
loads are available. While these are not ideal components, the open
has fringing capacitance; for example, they are well characterized over
frequency. The full set of standards required to develop the 12-term error
model includes one-port measurements for each port with open, short, and
match connections, a two-port measurement with a through connection, and
a two-port measurement with opens at each port. The last measurement
determines the internal isolation of the system. Most connectors come in
male and female counterparts. As such it is not possible to create a perfect
through by joining the connectors and a small delay is introduced. There
are, however, sexless connectors, such as the Amphenol precision connector
(APC-7) with a 7 mm outer diameter as it has a flush face that can be
connected for a near-perfect through. The APC-7 connector is no longer
commonly used, with most coaxial systems now using SMA connectors
or the higher-tolerance APC 3.5 connectors that come in male and female
connectors. The majority of the measurements desired these days are of
ICs and other planar structures for which there is no clear connector. The
connector, or fixture, problem has resulted in a variety of standards being
used.

Planar Circuit Calibration

Calibration standards are required in microwave measurements. For
measurements of microstrip and CPW systems, standard calibration alumina
substrates are available, see Figure 4-5(d and e). These calibration substrates
include various lengths of transmission lines that can be used as standards,
as well as an open, a short, and a laser-trimmed matched load.

4.3.4 Transmission Line-Based Calibration Schemes

A drawback of all de-embedding techniques that use repeated fixture
measurements during the de-embedding process is the generation of errors
caused by the lack of fixture reproducibility during measurements of each of
the required standards. These errors can be amplified during the course of
de-embedding.
The TRL technique [3] is a calibration procedure used for microwave
measurements when classical standards such as open, short, and matched
terminations cannot be realized. There are now a family of related
techniques, here denoted as TxL methods, with the commonality being the
two-port measurement of a through connection and of the same structure
with an inserted transmission line. The two-port connections required in
the TRL procedure are shown in Figure 4-11. The concept behind the
representation is that there is a measurement error that is captured by

fixtures; and (d)with arbitrary reflection.

     the fixture two-port. The TRL procedure allows the fixtures on either side,
     Fixtures A and B here, to have different two-port parameters. The SFG
     representations of the connections are shown in Figure 4-12. Assuming that
     the fixtures are faithfully reproduced when going from one connection to
     another, then the SFGs shown in 4-12(a-c) need to be considered. With
     each configuration, two-port measurements are made, and as the number of
     independent S parameter measurements exceed the number of unknowns,
     it would seem that it may be possible to solve the SFGs to obtain the
     unknown parameters of the fixtures. This is all that is required to de-embed
     measurements made with a DUT between the fixtures. Unfortunately this
     is not possible. However, Engen and Hoer [3] developed a procedure that
     enabled the complex propagation constant of the line to be extracted from
     the external S parameter measurements of the through and line connections.
     This procedure is considered in the next section.

     4.3.5 Through-Line Calibration

     The through and line measurement structures include fixtures as well as
     the direct connection (for the through) and the inserted line (for the line)
     (see Figure 4-11). Two-port measurements of these two structures yield the
     propagation constant L =  +  of the line [3]. Similar but earlier work
     was presented by Bianco et al. [12]. For the through structure, the error
     networks between the ideal internal port of a network analyzer and the
     desired measurement reference plane are designated as Fixture A at Port 1
     and Fixture B at Port 2. For the line measurement, fixturing is reestablished
     (following the through measurement) with the line inserted. In general, the
GRAPHICAL MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENTS                                                101

fixturing cannot be faithfully reproduced and therefore becomes Fixtures A
and B, respectively (see Figure 4-11).

The following is based on the derivation of Engen and Hoer [3]. As
well as presenting an important result indicating sources of error in

microwave measurement, the development demonstrates a technique for
solving measurement problems involving transmission lines.

The development begins using cascading matrices, R, defined as

          R = R21                                         S21

Thus the parameters describing the A and B fixtures are SA, SB and RA, RB,
respectively. The cascading matrix of the through is simply a unity matrix
and the line of length, L, is described by

                                   e-LL                   0                               (4.14)

                                         0              eLL

The characteristic impedance of the line is taken as the reference impedance,
Z0, of the measurement system and results in the off-diagonal zeros in
the above definition for the line standard. Because of this simplifying
assumption, L can be computed using the equations that follow.
The cascading matrix of the through structure (i.e., the fixture-fixture
cascade) is

                         Rt = RARB (the through).                                         (4.15)

For the line structure, a fixturing error  is introduced.  corresponds to a

small  additional  electrical  length  of     the    A  fixture  (i.e.,  R     =  RARe),  then  the

                                                                            A

cascading matrix of the fixture-line-fixture cascade is

                                                                               0          e .

Now introduce the matrix                        t12  
                                      
                                         t11                     -1
                                                        = RdRt .                          (4.17)
                               T = t21          t22

Thus T combines the line and through measurements and approximately

removes the through measurement from the line measurement. Most
importantly, all of the elements of the T matrix are measured quantities.
Continuing (note that if A and B are matrices, (AB)-1 = B-1A-1), and

using Equations (4.15)-(4.17),

                      -1                                         -1
          TRA = RdRt RA = RARLRB (RARB) RA

          = RAReRLRBRB-1RA-1RA                                                            (4.18)
                                                                                          (4.19)
and so    TRA = RAReRL,
102  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

     which is referred to as the TL (for through-line) equation.  (4.20)
     Expanding Equation (4.19) leads to a system of equations:    (4.21)
                                                                  (4.22)
                               t11RA11 + t12RA21 = RA11e-e-LL     (4.23)
                               t21RA11 + t22RA21 = RA21e-e-LL
                               t11RA12 + t12RA22 = RA12eeLL
                               t21RA12 + t22RA22 = RA22eeLL ,

     which upon solution yields the propagation constant of the line standard [3],

     L = 1 ln    t11 + t22    - 2                                (4.24)
            2 L  t11 + t22                                        (4.25)

      = t112 - 2 t11t22 + t222 + 4 t21t12 1/2 .

     If the fixtures are faithfully reproduced, then networks A and A are identical,
     as are networks B and B, and so  = 0, and L is

     L = 1 ln t11 + t22   .                                      (4.26)
            2 L t11 + t22  

     The sign to use with  is chosen corresponding to the root selection [3].
     That is, two-port S parameter measurements of the through connection
     (shown in Figure 4-11(a)) and two-port S parameter measurements of the
     line connection (shown in Figure 4-11(b)) enable the propagation constant of
     the line to be determined. The characteristic impedance of the line standard
     can be determined as described in Section 4.5.
     Extraction of the propagation constant of the transmission line standard
     is a common property of calibration techniques that use through and
     line measurements instead of match measurements. Such techniques are
     called TxL techniques, where x identifies an additional measurement used
     in calibration. Unfortunately the TxL calibration techniques often result
     in errors in de-embedding at frequencies where the length of the line
     standard is a multiple of one-half wavelength (called critical lengths [13, 14]).
     These are the lengths where the electrical length is a multiple of 180.
     Buff et al. [15, 16] showed that small fixture repeatability errors result
     in errors incorporated in . These errors affect the entire calibration and
     subsequent de-embedded measurements. These errors are minimized by
     using measurements where the line standard has an electrical length not
     within 20 of a critical length. Statistical means and the use of multiple
     lines have been proposed to minimize the error [17, 18], as well as an
     optimization scheme to determine the additional electrical length,  [15, 16].
     The optimization scheme significantly reduces the uncertainty and is based
     on the assumption that a change of line length is the sole source of error
     in fixture reproducibility (the fixture here includes, of course, the probe and
     probe pad). This is seen in Figure 4-13 where the results of optimization are
     seen most clearly for the attenuation constant in Figure 4-13(a), the curve
     labeled fixture error de-embedded. The no fixture error curve was selected
     as the best results from a large number of calibrations (multiple repeats of
     probe-on-probe pad connections). The fixture error curve is the result of a
     typical calibration measurement.

In the following, several of the TxL calibration techniques are described.
These are techniques incorporated in most vector network analyzers and
are particularly useful in characterizing on-chip circuits. An example of an
on-wafer two-port measurement is shown in Figure 4-14, showing on-chip
calibration standards. The VNA software leads the user through the required
set of calibration measurements and computes the error models to be used
in de-embedding.

Through Short Delay

Matched loads can be difficult to realize, especially when probing ICs and
planar circuits using probes. The through short delay (TSD) method uses
reflection and transmission measurements [19]. The delay is realized using a
line with a 50  characteristic impedance. TSD experiences the 180 glitches
common to TxL schemes. The through could be another delay, but then
problems occur when the delay difference (the electrical length difference)
of the through and delay is an integer multiple of 180.

Through Reflect Line

What has become known as the through reflect line (TRL) calibration
technique was developed by Bianco et al. [12] and Engen and Hoer [3],
who used a through connection, an arbitrary reflection standard, and a
delay or line standard. The line standard can be of arbitrary length with
its propagation constant unknown, but it is assumed to be nonreflecting.
The result of this assumption is that the characteristic impedance of the line
becomes the system reference impedance. Also, the reflection standard, can
be any repeatable reflection load, with an open or short preferred. Again
the transmission line introduces calibration uncertainties when the electrical

     length is a multiple of one-half wavelength [3].

     Through Reflect Match

     Through reflect match (TRM) is a variation of TRL that replaces the through
     by a matched load and is useful only when a matched load can be realized.
     It retains the arbitrary reflection standard, which is particularly useful as
     it can be difficult to produce a short or open with planar circuits. For
     example, a via used in realizing a microstrip short circuit has finite resistance
     and inductance and so does not create a good through, but does create a
     useful repeatable arbitrary reflection. The technique does not have the critical
     length glitches, but repeatable fixturing is always important.

     Other Distributed Calibration Techniques

     TRL and TRM are the most commonly accepted standards used in calibrating
     measurements of planar circuit structures. There are several other related
     techniques that also use transmission lines and are useful in certain
     circumstances.
     In 1982 Benet [20] developed the open-short-five-offset-line calibration
     technique. The key concept is that the multiple offset through lines trace out
     a circle on the Smith chart and the center of the circle provide the matched
     load. Through least squares fitting Benet derived the propagation constant of
     the through lines and the remaining error terms to develop the 12-term error
     model.
     Pennock et al. [21] introduced the double through line (DTL) calibration
     system in 1987. This is useful for characterizing transitions between different
     mediums. There is sufficient information to develop the 6-term error model.
     SOLT (short-open-load-through) calibration requires precisely characterized
     standards and is robust to 20 GHz.
     SOLR (short-open-load-reciprocal-through) calibration is similar to SOLT
     using precisely defined reflect standards as a standard.
     LRRM, (line-reflect-reflect-match) calibration uses a line instead of a through,
     one of the reflection standards is a short and the other is an open. This is
GRAPHICAL MICROWAVE NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENTS  105

                                                                                                Figure 4-15: Two-tier
                                                                                                calibration procedure.

usually the best calibration technique to use with probes, as these standards
are straightforward to incorporate in calibration substrates. The calibration
standards are the same as those used in SOLT, but LRRM does not require
precision short and open standards. The essentials of what must be known
are the characteristics of the through and the DC resistance of one of the load
standards. The inductance of the load is automatically determined.
LRM, (load-reflect-match) calibration is similar to LRRM calibration but does
not use a precision reflect standard. A modification is LRM+, for which the
DC resistances of the loads are required.

4.3.6 Two-Tier Calibration

With measurements in noncoaxial systems, it is difficult to produce precision
standards such as shorts, opens, and resistive loads. In these situations, two-
tier calibration is sometimes used. In a two-tier calibration procedure, two
sets of standards are used to establish first- and second-tier reference planes
(see Figure 4-15). It is preferable to use a highly repeatable set of standards
in Tier 1 (such as a non-TxL technique), and one that yields more precise
characterization in a particular environment (such as a TxL technique for
on-wafer measurement).
In the first-tier calibration, a precision set of standards is normally used. This
can be achieved using coaxial standards or perhaps a standard calibration
substrate used with probes. Referring to Figure 4-15, each of the 2 two-
ports from the internal reference planes of the network analyzer to the
external reference planes is established. Generally with the second tier, insitu
calibration standards are used, and the additional (e.g. on-chip) fixturing
is identical for the two ports. Precision calibration should be done using
standards fabricated in the medium of the DUT.
Two-tier calibration generally results in the fixtures in the second tier being
identical. This enables checks to be made for the integrity of the probe
connection. Connections to IC pads can be problematic because of oxide
build up, especially with aluminum pads. So ensuring symmetry of second-
tier calibrations by comparing the two-port measurements of symmetrical
structures such as transmission lines can greatly reduce the impact of the
fixture-induced errors discussed in Section 4.3.5. Recall that small fixturing
errors, such as bringing the probes down in slightly different positions,

calibration procedure: (a) through connection;

configuration.

                     results in measurement errors at the half-wavelength frequencies (/2, ,
                     3/2, etc.). For example, if the DUT is a device on a silicon wafer, the
                     optimum measurement technique is to realize the calibration standards on
                     the silicon wafer processed in the same way as for the DUT. The two-
                     tier calibration procedure removes fixturing errors associated with fringing
                     effects at the probes and with other nonidealities involved in creating the
                     landing pads for the probes.
                     In an example two-tier calibration scheme, a first tier is used to establish
                     the 12-term error model. Then a second calibration is used to develop a
                     secondary six-term error model, as in Figure 4-10(a) with S12 = S21. In such
                     a situation the standards used in developing the 12-term error model would
                     normally include an open, a short, and a matched load. These need not be
                     precise standards. Thus the 12-term error model need not be precise, and this
                     model does not suffer from the half-wavelength errors of the TxL techniques.

                     Through Line Symmetry

                     For planar measurements using probes, first-tier calibration using a standard
                     calibration substrate is to the end of the probe tips, and errors with using
                     other substrates (e.g., the probe pads are of different size or the substrate
                     permittivity is different) will be common to both probes (fixtures) in a two-
                     port measurement. With careful design, the fixtures employed in the second
                     tier will be identical and have the same S parameters. In the second-tier
                     calibration, measurements of a through and line will be symmetrical with
                     S11 = S22 and S12 = S21. This symmetry is exploited in the through line
                     (TL) technique which exploits symmetry and renders the half-wavelength
                     errors of TxL insignificant [4, 5]. The TL calibration connections in second-
                     tier calibration are shown in Figure 4-16. In the first calibration tier, a 12-term
                     error model is developed using open, short, load, and delay. Consequently
                     there are no half-wavelength glitches that occur when transmission line
                     standards are used. In the second calibration tier, probes are used with two
                     lengths of transmission line fabricated on the same substrate as the DUT. One
                     of the lines becomes a through.
                     The procedure proceeds by calculating the propagation constant of the line
                     using the technique developed for the TRL procedure (Equation (4.26)).
                     There is fixture symmetry in the TL connections (see Figure 4-16) and this
                     is reflected in the SFG representations of the connections as shown in Figure
                     4-17. As will be shown, this symmetry enables the arbitrary reflection used

in the TRL procedure to be replaced by a virtual precise short or open circuit.
Let the S parameters of Fixture A be  = S11,  = S12 = S21, and  = S22.
Using these parameters with the port reversal required to model the Fixture
at Port 2, the SFG shown in Figure 4-17(a) relates the measured S parameters
to the parameters of the fixtures. The input reflection coefficient of Fixture A
with a short circuit placed at Port 2 of A is

                        sc =  -       2   .                      (4.27)

                                      1+

Let the measured S parameters of the through connection be designated by a
leading superscript T . Using the self-loop (or Mason's) rule with the SFG in
Figure 4-17(a) relates the measured S parameters to the fixture parameters:

   T  S11 =  +          2             and T S21 =  2             (4.28)
                                                       2.
                        1-  2                      1-

Subtracting these expressions yields

T  S11 - S21 =  +T      2  2-         2               2 - 2
                                          2 =+

                        (1 - )(1 + )         1+

That is, the input reflection coefficient of a fixture terminated in a virtual ideal
short circuit can be obtained from the through measurement of the back-to-
back fixtures in the through configuration:

                        sc = T S11 - T S21.                      (4.30)

Similar results are obtained for a virtual ideal open circuit placed at Port 2 of
Fixture A:

                        oc = T S11 + T S21.                      (4.31)

Thus it is possible to effectively insert ideal open and short circuits within a
noninsertable medium.

4.4 Extraction of Transmission Line Parameters

This section describes approaches for extracting the per unit length
RLGC parameters of a transmission line, and the effective permittivity
and permeability of transmission line mediums, from measurements. The
measurements could be made experimentally or through simulation.

     Ideal Calibration

     The procedure described here assumes ideal calibration to the ports of a
     uniform transmission line that will yield symmetrical transmission line S
     parameters with S11 = S22 and S12 = S21 for the reciprocal structure.
     The propagation constant of a transmission line is

                               = (R + L)(G + C)                    (4.32)

     and the characteristic impedance is

                                 Z0 =     (R + L) .                (4.33)

     These parameters can be extracted from the measured S parameters of
     a transmission line provided that sufficiently accurate calibration can be
     achieved. This extraction was described in [22-24], yielding the line's
     characteristic impedance

     propagation constant is obtained from

     It is also possible to use specialized test structures to obtain the transmission
     line parameters. In [25] measurements of the input impedances of short- and
     open-circuited stubs are used to derive the transmission line parameters.

     Nonideal Calibration

     The measurement of the S parameters of a transmission line described
     above assumes that the error model of the fixtures can be accurately
     calibrated. Sometimes it can be difficult to achieve a sufficiently accurate
     calibration because of the difficulty of inserting a known resistive impedance
     standard. In the through-line calibration methods described in Section 4.3.5,
     measurement of a fixtured transmission line and measurement of back-to-
     back fixtures (a through connection) yields the propagation constant  of the
     transmission line, even if an impedance standard is not available. One way
     of extracting the characteristic impedance, Z0, of a line from measurements
     in this situation was described in Section 4.5. The key idea was varying the
     electrical length of a transmission line to trace out a circle on the Smith chart.
     The frequency-dependent characteristic impedance can be obtained by using
     a number of transmission lines of different length. So with  and Z0 known,
     the RLGC parameters can be obtained using Equation (4.34).

4.4.1 Summary

The complexity and expense of equipment involved in measuring S
parameters depends greatly on the frequency range with vector network
analyzers able to measure S parameters above a hundred gigahertz
costing many 100s of thousands of dollars. Also the time involved in
calibration can be significant taking many hours to days at the very
highest of microwave frequencies but only a few minutes at single-
gigahertz frequencies. Microwave measurement requires the development
of considerable expertise.

4.5 Determining Z0 of a Line from the Smith Chart

It was shown in Section 3.5.2 that the reflection coefficient locus with respect

to frequency of a terminated line is a circle on the Smith chart even if

the characteristic impedance of the line is not the same as the reference
impedance of the Smith chart. The one caveat here is that the reflection

coefficient of the termination must be independent of frequency so a resistive
termination is sufficient. If the characteristic impedance of the line is Z01
and the Smith chart is referenced to Z02, which is usually the same as the
system impedance of the measurement system, then Z01 can be determined
from the center, CZ02, and radius, RZ02, of the reflection coefficient circle.
Thus measurements can be used to determine the unknown impedance Z01.
Another situation where this is useful is in design where a transmission
line circle can be drawn to complete a design problem and from this the
characteristic impedance of the line found. In both situations CZ02, RZ02,
and Z02 are known and Z01 must be determined.
A simple closed-form solution for the unkown characteristic impedance
Z01 cannot be obtained from Equations (3.49) and (3.50). However, by
substituting Equation (3.50) in Equation (3.49), and if Z01 and Z02 are close
(so that B is small), then

CZ02  B - 1 + 1  B.                                    (4.38)
                 BB

The approximation is better for smaller |L,Z01|. Also

RZ02  |L,Z01| .                                        (4.39)

So provided that the characteristic impedance of the line, Z01, is close to the
system reference impedance, Z02,

Z01 = 1 + B  1 + CZ02                                  (4.40)
Z02 1 - B 1 - CZ02

and this is just the normalized impedance reading at the center of the circle.
For example, if a line with a characteristic impedance (Z01) of 55  is
terminated in a 45  load, then in a (Z02 =) 50  system, CZ02 = 0.0939
and RZ02 = 0.0996. Using Equation (4.40) the derived Z01 = 54.7  and, using
Equation (4.39), L,Z01 = 0.0996 compared to the ideal 0.1000.
Table 4-1 presents the actual characteristic impedance of the line as the ratio
ZZ01/ZZ02 for particular center and radius values measured on the polar
plot referenced to Z02. The actual value of impedance is compared to the
approximate value for ZZ01/ZZ02  1 + CZ02/1 - CZ02. It is seen that the
110                                    STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

approximation in Equation (4.40) provides a good estimate of the unknown
characteristic impedance (Z01) improving as the center of the locus is closer
to the origin.

4.6 Summary

The vendors of microwave test equipment program their instruments so
that they guide the user through the calibration procedure. Usually the
calibration procedures take much longer than the actual DUT measurement.
The higher the frequency the longer and more fastidious is calibration, with
calibration at 200 GHz perhaps taking days. Still calibration is absolutely
required and with it surprisingly accurate measurements can be made at
microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies.

5.1 Introduction

This chapter introduces a wide variety of passive components. It is not
possible to be comprehensive, as there is an enormous catalog of microwave
elements and scores of variations, and new concepts are introduced every
year. At microwave frequencies distributed components can be constructed
that have features with particular properties related to coupling, to traveling
waves, and to storage of EM energy. Sometimes it is possible to develop
lumped-element equivalents of the distributed elements by using the LC
ladder model of a transmission line thus realizing lumped-element circuits
that would be difficult to imagine otherwise.

5.2 Q Factor

RF inductors and capacitors also have loss and parasitic elements. With
inductors there is both series resistance and shunt capacitance mainly
from interwinding capacitance, while with capacitors there will be shunt
resistance and series inductance. A practical inductor or capacitor is limited

     resonant circuit. (The transfer function
     is V /I for the parallel resonant circuit
     of Figure 5-2(a) and I/V for the series
     resonant circuit of Figure 5-2(b).)

     to operation below the self-resonant frequency determined by the inductance
     and capacitance itself resonating with its reactive parasitics. The impact of
     loss is quantified by the Q factor (the quality factor). Q is loosely related to
     bandwidth in general and the strict relationship is based on the response
     of a series or parallel connection of a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a
     capacitor (C). The response of an RLC network is described by a second-
     order differential equation with the conclusion that the 3 dB fractional
     bandwidth of the response (i.e., when the power response is at its half-power
     level below its peak response) is 1/Q. (The fractional bandwidth is f /f0
     where f0 = fr is the resonant frequency at the center of the band and f is
     the 3 dB bandwidth.) This is not true for any network other than a second-
     order circuit, but as a guiding principle, networks with higher Qs will have
     narrower bandwidths.

     5.2.1 Definition

     The Q factor of a component at frequency f is defined as the ratio of 2f
     times the maximum energy stored to the energy lost per cycle. In a lumped-
     element resonant circuit, stored energy is transferred between an inductor,
     which stores magnetic energy, and a capacitor, which stores electric energy,
     and back again every period. Distributed resonators function the same way,
     exchanging energy stored in electric and magnetic forms, but with the energy
     stored spatially. The quality factor is

     Q = 2fr average energy stored in the resonator at fr , (5.1)
                               power lost in the resonator

     where f1 = r/(2) is the resonant frequency.
     A simple response is shown in Figure 5-1. For a parallel resonant circuit with
     elements L, C, and G = 1/R (see Figure 5-2(a)),

                                   Q = rC/G = 1/(rLG),              (5.2)

     where fr = r/(2) is the resonant frequency and is the frequency at which
     the maximum amount of energy is stored in a resonator. The conductance,
     G, describes the energy lost in a cycle. For a series resonant circuit (Figure
     5-2(b)) with L, C, and R elements,

                                   Q = rL/R = 1/(rCR).              (5.3)
PASSIVE COMPONENTS                                                               117

                    Figure 5-3: Loss elements of practical inductors and capacitors:

                    (a) an inductor has a series resistance R; and (b) for a capacitor,

(a)  (b)            the dominant loss mechanism is a shunt conductance G = 1/R.

These second-order resonant circuits have a bandpass transfer characteristic
(see Figure 5-1) with Q being the inverse of the fractional bandwidth of the
resonator. The fractional bandwidth, f /fr, is measured at the half-power
points as shown in Figure 5-1. (f is also referred to as the two-sided -3 dB
bandwidth.) Then

                    Q = fr/f.                (5.4)

Thus the Q is a measure of the sharpness of the bandpass frequency response.
The determination of Q using the measurement of bandwidth together
with Equation (5.4) is often not very precise, so another definition that
uses the much more sensitive phase change at resonance is preferred when
measurements are being used. With  being the phase (in radians) of the
transfer characteristic, the definition of Q is now

                    Q = r d  . (5.5)
                           2 d

Equation (5.5) is another equivalent definition of Q for parallel RLC or series
RLC resonant circuits. It is meaningful to talk about the Q of circuits other
than three-element RLC circuits, and then its meaning is always a ratio of the
energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle. The Q of these structures
can no longer be determined by bandwidth or by the rate of phase change.

5.2.2 Q of Lumped Elements

Q is also used to characterize the loss of lumped inductors and capacitors.
Inductors have a series resistance R, and the main loss mechanism of a
capacitor is a shunt conductance G (see Figure 5-3).
The Q of an inductor at frequency f = /(2) with a series resistance R and
inductance L is

                    QINDUCTOR = L .          (5.6)
                                         R

Since R is approximately constant with respect to frequency for an inductor,
the Q will vary with frequency.
The Q of a capacitor with a shunt conductance G and capacitance C is

                    QCAPACITOR = C .         (5.7)
                                          G

G is due mainly to relaxation loss mechanisms of the dielectric of a capacitor
and so varies linearly with frequency. Thus the Q of a capacitor is almost
constant with respect to frequency. For microwave components invariably
QCAPACITOR  QINDUCTOR, and QINDUCTOR is smaller than the Q of
transmission line networks. Thus, if the length of a transmission line is not
too long, transmission line networks are preferred. If lumped elements must
be used, the use of inductors should be minimized.

     5.2.3 Loaded Q Factor

     The Q of a component as defined in the previous section is called the
     unloaded Q, QU . However if a component is to be measured or used in any
     way, it is necessary to couple energy in and out of it. The Q is reduced and
     thus the resonator bandwidth is increased by the power lost to the external
     circuit so that the loaded Q, then the loaded Q is

     QL = 2f0  average energy stored in the resonator atf0

               power lost in the resonator and to the external circuit

           = 1 , (5.8)
              1/Q + 1/QX

     where QX is called the external Q. QL accounts for the power extracted from
     the resonant circuit.
     So a parallel LCG circuit with elements Lr, Cr, and Gr (at resonance) loaded
     by a shunt conductance Gl has

     and   QU = rCr/Gr = 1/(rLrGr)                                       (5.9)
     Thus                                                               (5.10)
           QL = rCr/(Gr + Gl).                                          (5.11)
     or     1=1+1
           QL QU QX                                                     (5.12)

                       1 1 -1
           QX = QL - QU .

     QX is called the external Q, and it describes the effect of loading. QL is the Q
     that would actually be measured. QU normally needs to be determined, but
     if the loading is kept very small, QL  QU .

     5.2.4 Summary of the Properties of Q

     In summary:

     5.3 Integrated Lumped Elements

     This section considers lumped-elements used in integrated circuits operating
     at microwave frequencies. Lumped elements such as capacitors, inductors
     and resistors can rarely be regarded as pure elements at microwave
     frequencies. Inductors and capacitors have significant loss and all of the
     elements store energy in both electric and magnetic forms.

5.3.1 On-Chip Capacitors

There are three primary forms of on-chip capacitor:

  (a) Metal-dielectric-metal capacitor--using interconnect metalization.
  (b) Metal-dielectric-semiconductor capacitor--essentially a MOS transis-

       tor.
  (c) Semiconductor junction capacitor--either the capacitance of a reverse-

       biased pn junction or Schottky barrier.

In silicon technology it is common to refer to the first capacitor type as a
metal-oxide-metal (MOM) capacitor or as a metal-insulator-metal (MIM)
capacitor. A MOM capacitor can be realized as a parallel plate capacitance
(see Figure 5-4(a)), and multiple levels of metalization can be used to
increase the capacitance density. Relatively low capacitance values of up to
500 fF/탆2 are typically available.
An alternative MOM capacitance is available using lateral arrangements
of conductors on the same layer (see Figure 5-4(b)); that is, adjacent metal
structures are separated by a small horizontal gap. Again, there are two
distinct metal connections, and a smaller metal separation can be obtained
using photolithography than that possible using dielectric separation.
However the capacitance density is only increased by a factor of about three.
Higher values can be obtained using the interdigitated capacitor (IDC) of
Figure 5-4(c). Both types of MOM capacitance, parallel plate and lateral, are
geometrically defined, are voltage independent, have very low temperature
coefficients, and have initial fabrication tolerances of 20%-30%.
The second type of capacitor in MOS technology is referred to as a
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor. MOS capacitors use a MOS
transistor with a parallel-plate capacitance between the gate of a MOS
transistor and a heavily inverted channel. The drain and source are
connected in this configuration and the separation between the conductors
is thin, being the gate oxide thickness. This leads to high values of
capacitance, although with a weak voltage dependence. Junction capacitance
is realized as the capacitance of a reverse-biased semiconductor junction.
This capacitance can be quite large, but has a strong voltage dependence.
This voltage dependence can be utilized to realize tunable circuits (e.g., a
voltage-controlled oscillator).

     5.3.2 Planar Inductors

     Inductors are important components in RF and microwave circuits. In
     addition to their role in matching networks, they are used to provide bias
     to active devices while effectively blocking RF signals from the bias circuitry.
     Inductors of up to 10 nH can be fabricated in compact form, with the spiral
     inductor of Figure 5-4(e) being typical. Bond wires can also be used to realize
     small inductances in the 0.5-1 nH range. One of the advantages of having
     a portion of a large inductance on-chip is reduced sensitivity to die attach
     (bondwire, etc.) connections used to connect to an external inductance. Small
     values of inductance can be realized by the meander line inductor of Figure
     5-4(d). This is based on a high-impedance length of line (narrow line in
     microstrip) appearing inductive.
     An on-chip spiral inductor is shown in Figure 5-5. An approximate
     expression for the inductance of this structure was developed by Wheeler
     [1-3]:

                                   L  9.40n2a2 ,                            (5.13)
                                          11d - 7a

     where a is the mean radius of the spiral and n is the number of turns. This
     formula was derived for circular coils, but its accuracy for square spirals is
     within 5% of values obtained using EM simulation [4]. It is therefore a very
     useful formula in the early stages of design, but EM analysis is required to
     obtain the necessary accuracy and frequency dependence of the inductor.
     Fields produced by a spiral inductor penetrate the substrate, and as the
     ground plane is located at a short distance away, the eddy currents on the
     ground plane reduce the inductance that would otherwise be obtained. The
     eddy current in the ground conductor rotates in a direction opposite to that
     of the current on the spiral itself. As a result, the flux of the image inductor
     in the ground is in the opposite direction to that produced by the spiral
     itself, with the consequent effect that the effective total inductance is reduced.
     By creating a broken conductor pattern, the ground inductance is largely
     eliminated as the eddy currents cannot flow [5].
     All inductors have appreciable resistive loss of conductors, and for inductors
     on semiconductor substrates, loss due to induced substrate currents is
PASSIVE COMPONENTS                                                                 121

important and often dominates. Loss in the substrate is particularly large
in silicon substrates due to the finite conductivity of the substrate and the
resulting current flow. These induced currents follow a path under the
conductors of the spiral and, just as with ground plane eddy currents, lowers
the inductance achieved. However, the resistance of the lines is unchanged.
Thus on silicon it is difficult to achieve very high Qs (the ratio of stored
energy to energy dissipated per cycle).
Lumped inductors are based on coils of conductor, and there is parasitic
capacitance between the windings [6]. As a result there will be a frequency
where the capacitance and inductance resonate at what is called the self-
resonant frequency. The impedance of a realistic inductor is shown in Figure
5-5(c). If the practical inductor was purely inductive, then its impedance
would increase linearly with frequency. However, because of resonance, the
effective inductance increases just before resonance causing the impedance
of the practical inductor to increase more rapidly than linearly. This is seen in
Figure 5-5(c), and this effect is often used in narrowband microwave circuits.

5.4 Surface-Mount Components

The majority of the RF and microwave design effort goes into developing
modules and interconnecting modules on circuit boards. With these the most
common type of component to use is surface-mount. Figure 5-6(a) shows
a two-terminal element, such as a resistor or capacitor, in the form of a
surface-mount component. Figure 5-6(b and c) show the use of surface-
mount components on a microwave circuit board.

     A two-terminal surface-mount resistor or capacitor is commonly called a
     chip resistor or chip capacitor. These can be very small, and the smaller
     the component often the higher the operating frequency due to reduced
     parasitic capacitance or inductance. Common sizes of two-terminal chip
     components are listed in Table 5-1. With a chip resistor or chip capacitor,
     the parasitic inductance determines the maximum operating frequency with
     the self-resonant frequency, in the case of a chip capacitor, being when the
     capacitance resonates with the parasitic inductance. The usable maximum
     frequency is below the self-resonant frequency.
     Figure 5-7(a) shows an inductor in a surface-mount package and details
     are shown in Figure 5-7(b). This inductor is wound on a dielectric former,
     which, unfortunately, increases the inductor's parasitic capacitance. The
     resonance of this capacitance with the inductance establishes the self-
     resonant frequency (SRF) of the inductor. The inductor is useable as an
     inductor at a frequency backed-off from the SRF. The parasitic capacitance is
     reduced if the inductor has an air core, as for the inductors shown in Figure
     5-7(c), with details shown in Figure 5-7(d). The air enables the inductor
     performance to be improved if the size remains the same or the inductor
     is smaller for comparable performance. The performance of the two types of
     inductors is listed in Tables 5-2 and 5-3.

     5.5 Terminations and Attenuators

     5.5.1 Terminations

     Terminations are used to completely absorb a forward-traveling wave and
     the defining characteristic is that the reflection coefficient of a termination is
     ideally zero. If a transmission line has a resistive characteristic impedance

R0 = Z0, then terminating the line in a resistance R0 will fully absorb the
forward-traveling wave and there will be no reflection. The line is then said
to be matched. At RF and microwave frequencies some refinements to this
simple circuit connection are required. On a transmission line the energy is
contained in the EM fields. For the coaxial line, a simple resistive connection
between the inner and outer conductors would not terminate the fields and
there would be some reflection. Instead, coaxial line terminations generally
comprise a disk of resistive material (see Figure 5-8(a)). The total resistance of
the disk from the inner to the outer conductor is the characteristic resistance
of the line, however, the resistive material is distributed and so creates a good
termination of the fields guided by the coaxial conductors.
Terminations are a problem with microstrip, as the characteristic impedance
varies with frequency, is in general complex, and the vias that would
be required if a lumped resistor was used has appreciable inductance at

     frequencies above a few gigahertz. A high-quality termination is realized
     using a section of lossy line as shown in Figure 5-8(b). Here lossy material
     is deposited on top of an open-circuited microstrip line. This increases the
     loss of the line appreciably without significantly affecting the characteristic
     impedance of the line. If the length of the lossy line is sufficiently long, say
     one wavelength, the forward-traveling wave will be totally absorbed and
     there will be no reflection. Tapering the lossy material, as shown in Figure
     5-8(b), reduces the discontinuity between the lossless microstrip line and the
     lossy line by ensuring that some of the power in the forward-traveling wave
     is dissipated before the maximum impact of the lossy material occurs. Thus
     a matched termination is achieved without the use of a via.

     5.5.2 Attenuators

     An attenuator is a two-port network used to reduce the amplitude of a
     signal and it does this by absorbing power and without distorting the signal.
     The input and output of the attenuator are both matched, so there are no
     reflections. An attenuator may be fixed, continuously variable, or discretely
     variable. The IEEE standard symbols for attenuators are shown in Table 5-4.
     When the attenuation is fixed, an attenuator is commonly called a pad.
     Resistive pads can be used to minimize the effect of shorts and opens on

the integrity of an RF circuit. An example of attenuator use in this situation
is in a cable TV system, where it is critical that the integrity of the system
is not compromised by a consumer disconnecting appliances from a cable
outlet.
Balanced and unbalanced resistive pads are shown in Figures 5-9 and 5-10
together with their design equations. The attenuators in Figure 5-9 are T
or Tee attenuators, where Z01 is the system impedance to the left of the
pad and Z02 is the system impedance to the right of the pad. The defining
characteristic is that the reflection coefficient looking into the pad from the
left is zero when referred to Z01. Similarly, the reflection coefficient looking

     from the right of the pad is zero with respect to Z02. The attenuation factor is

                                      K = Power in .                                 (5.20)

     In decibels, the attenuation is

                             K|dB = 10 log10 K = (Power in)|dBm - (Power out)|dBm .  (5.21)

     If the left and right system impedances are different, then there is a minimum
     attenuation factor that can be achieved [10]:

                                                        

                              2Z01 - Z02 + 2 Z01 (Z01 - Z02) /Z02  , Z01  Z02
                                                                   , Z01  Z02
     KMIN =                                                                          (5.22)

                              2Z02 - Z01 + 2 Z02 (Z02 - Z01) /Z01

     This limitation comes from the simultaneous requirement that the pad be
     matched. If there is a single system impedance, Z0 = Z01 = Z02, then
     KMIN = 1, and so any value of attenuation can be obtained.
     Lumped attenuators are useful up to 10 GHz above which the size of
     resistive elements becomes large compared to a wavelength. Also, for planar
     circuits, vias are required, and these are undesirable from a manufacturing
     standpoint, and electrically they have a small inductance. Fortunately
     attenuators can be realized using a lossy section of transmission line, as
     shown in Figure 5-11. Here, lossy material results in a section of line with
     a high-attenuation constant. Generally the lossy material has little effect on
     the characteristic impedance of the line, so there is little reflection at the
     input and output of the attenuator. Distributed attenuators can be used at
     frequencies higher than lumped-element attenuators can, and they can be
     realized with any transmission line structure.
     Another example of the use of attenuators in combining the output of two
     sources is shown in Figure 5-12. This is a common situation in measurements
     where the outputs of two instrumentation sources are to be combined. The
     attenuators reduce the level of the signal presented to the output of one
     source by the other. If the level of the second signal is high, most sources
     would produce nonlinear distortion, including nonlinear mixing products.

EXAMPLE 5.1 Pad Design

Design an unbalanced 20 dB pad in a 75  system.

Solution:

There are two possible designs using resistive pads. These are the unbalanced Tee and Pi
pads shown in Figures 5-9 and 5-10. The Tee design will be chosen. The K factor is

                     K = 10( K|dB/10) = 10(20/10) = 100.                         (5.23)

Since Z01 = Z02 = 75 , Equation (5.15) yields

                              
                     R1 = R2 = 75 100 - 1 = 75 9 = 61.4

5.6 Transmission Line Stubs and Discontinuities

Interruptions of the magnetic or electric field create regions where additional
magnetic energy or electric energy is stored. If the additional energy stored
is predominantly magnetic, the discontinuity will introduce an inductance.
If the additional energy stored is predominantly electric, the discontinuity
will introduce a capacitance. Such discontinuities occur with all transmission
lines. In some cases transmission line discontinuities introduce undesired
parasitics, but they also provide an opportunity to effectively introduce
lumped-element components. In this section microstrip discontinuities will
be considered, but the principles apply to all transmission line structures.
The simplest microwave circuit element is a uniform section of transmission
line that can be used to introduce a time delay or frequency-dependent phase
shift. More commonly it is used to interconnect other components. Line
segments including bends and junctions are shown in Figure 5-13.

5.6.1 Open

Many transmission line discontinuities arise from fringing fields. One
element is the microstrip open, shown in Figure 5-14. The fringing fields at
the end of the transmission line in Figure 5-14(a) store energy in the electric
field, and this can be modeled by the fringing capacitance, CF , shown in
Figure 5-14(b). This effect can also be modeled by an extended transmission
128                    STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

     line, as shown in Figure 5-14(c). For a typical microstrip line with r = 9.6, h
     = 600 탆, and w/h = 1, CF is approximately 36 fF. However, CF varies with
     frequency, and the extended length is a much better approximation to the
     effect of fringing [12]. For the same dimensions, the length of the extension
     is approximately 0.35h and almost independent of frequency [13]. As with
     many fringing effects, a capacitance or inductance can be used to model the
     effect of fringing, but generally a distributed model is better.

     5.6.2 Discontinuities

     Several microstrip discontinuities and their equivalent circuits are shown
     in Figure 5-15. Discontinuities (Figure 5-15(b-g)) are modeled by capacitive
     elements if the E field is affected and by inductive elements if the H field
     (or current) is disturbed. The stub shown in Figure 5-15(b), for example,
     is best modeled using lumped elements describing the junction as well as
     the transmission line of the stub itself. Current bunches at the right angle
     bends from the through line to the stub. The current bunching leads to excess
     energy being stored in the magnetic field, and hence an inductive effect.
     There is also excess charge storage in the parallel plate region bounded by
     the left- and right-hand through lines and the stub. This is modeled by a
     capacitance.

5.6.3 Impedance Transformer

Impedance transformers interface two lines of different characteristic
impedance. The smoothest transition and the one with the broadest
bandwidth is a tapered line. This element can be long and then a quarter-
wave impedance transformer (see Figure 5-15(a)) is sometimes used,
although its bandwidth is relatively small and centered on the frequency at
which l = g/4. Ideally Z0,2 = Z0,1Z0,3. This topic is considered further in
Section 7.5 where the design of tapered lines and multi-stage quarter-wave
transformers are considered in detail.

5.6.4 Planar Radial Stub

The use of a radial stub (Figure 5-16(a)), as opposed to the conventional
microstrip stub (Figure 5-16(b)), can improve the bandwidth of many
microstrip circuits. A major advantage of a radial stub is that the input
impedance presented to the through line generally has broader bandwidth
than that obtained with the conventional stub. When two shunt-connected
radial stubs are introduced in parallel (i.e., one on each side of the microstrip
feeder line) the resulting configuration is termed a "butterfly" stub (see
Figure 5-16(c)). Critical design parameters include the radius, r, and the
angle of the stub.

application of the half-angle transform [14]; and (c) equivalence between series connection of

          5.6.5 Stub Transformations

          The stub transformations in Figure 5-17 enable the lengths of stubs to be
          reduced. The first two stub transformations (Figure 5-17(a and b)) are called
          half-angle transformations and enable a stub to be replaced by two shorter
          stubs. The third stub transformation (Figure 5-17(c)) enables two stubs to be
          replaced by two cascaded transmission lines.
          Figure 5-17(a) is a half-angle transform of a series open-circuited stub.
          Mathematically the transform is described as follows. Consider the input
          impedance of an open-circuited stub [14] with electrical length  =  at
          frequency f and which is a quarter-wavelength long at f0 (i.e.,  = /2 at f0)
          (from Section 2.4.4 of [15] and using Equation ((1.105)) of [15]):

          Zoc = -Z0 cot () =  (Z0/2) tan (/2) -  (Z0/2) / tan (/2) . (5.26)

          In general,  = (/2) (f /f0). The right-hand side of Equation (5.26) describes
          the series connection of short- and open-circuited stubs having characteristic
          impedances of Z0/2 and half the original electrical length. This implies
          that the resulting transmission line resonators are one-quarter wavelength
          long at 2f0 (i.e., they are one-eighth wavelength long at f0). The half-angle
          transformation applies at all frequencies and not just frequencies near f0.
          Through a similar analytical treatment, the short-circuited stub has the
          equivalence shown in Figure 5-17(b). The series short-circuited stub on the
          left in Figure 5-17(b) has the series admittance

            YT = 1 = 1 cot()                                                      (5.27)

PASSIVE COMPONENTS                                                              131

and the stubs in the transformation have an input impedance

                 Zoc = - 21 Z0 cot(/2) and Zsc =  12 Z0 tan(/2).     (5.28)
These stubs are in parallel so that the total input admittance is

YT = 1 + 1 = 2 + 1
        Zoc Zsc -Z0 cot(/2) Z0 tan(/2)

= 2 - tan(/2) + 1 ot(/2) = 1 cot().                                  (5.29)
Z0                          c                        Z0

Examining Equations (5.27) and (5.29) it is seen that they are identical, thus
Figure 5-17(b) represents another half-angle transformation.
For the series open- and short-circuited stubs in Figure 5-17(c), the input
impedances of the open- and short-circuited stubs are

Zoc = -Z02 cot() and Zsc = Z01 tan(),                                (5.30)

respectively, so that the total series impedance is

ZT = Zoc + Zsc = -Z02 cot() + Z01 tan().                             (5.31)

For the transformation on the right, the impedance looking into the open
circuit (outer) stub is

                            Zx = -Z2 cot()                           (5.32)

and the total impedance is

Z -Z T = Z1 2 cot() + Z1 tan() = -Z1Z2 cot() + Z12 tan() . (5.33)
Z1 + Z2 cot() tan()            Z1 + Z2                      Z1 + Z2

Equating Equations (5.31) and (5.33) and collecting terms,

Z02 = Z1Z2/(Z1 + Z2) and Z01 = Z12/(Z1 + Z2),                        (5.34)

and the transmission line segments (of characteristic impedance Z01, Z02, Z1
and Z2) all have the same electrical length.
In summary, the stub transformations hold no matter what the lengths of the
stubs. The half-angle stub transformations enable transmission line circuits
to be miniaturized.

5.7 Resonators

Near resonance, the response of a microwave resonator is very similar to
the resonance response of a parallel or series LC resonant circuit, shown in
Figure 5-18(e and f). These equivalent circuits can be used over a narrow
frequency range of perhaps 5% fractional bandwidth.
Several types of resonators are shown in Figure 5-18. Figure 5-18(a) is a
rectangular cavity resonator coupled to an external coaxial line by a small
coupling loop. Figure 5-18(b) is a microstrip patch reflection resonator.
This resonator has large coupling to the external circuit. The coupling
can be reduced and photolithographically controlled by introducing a gap,
as shown in Figure 5-18(c), to create what is called a microstrip gap-
coupled transmission line reflection resonator. The Q of a resonator can
be dramatically increased by using a low-loss, high-dielectric constant
material, as shown in Figure 5-18(d), for a dielectric transmission resonator
in microstrip.

                     5.7.1 Dielectric Resonators

                         Any dielectric structure can store EM energy, with the resonant frequency
                         dependent on both the permittivity and the physical dimensions. At the
                         resonance frequency, all resonators store the maximum amount of energy.
                         Two resonators that store particularly large amounts of energy are the cavity
                         resonator shown in Figure 5-18(a) and the dielectric resonator shown in
                         Figure 5-18(d).
                         Microwave ceramics can have very low loss and high permittivity (which
                         results in small wavelengths and hence small size) and are commonly used
                         in microwave resonators. Low-loss ceramic materials with permittivities in
                         the range of 21 to 150 are generally available and unloaded Q factors are in
                         the 5,000 to 10,000 range. Physical dimensions generally depend upon the
                         resonant frequencies desired.
                         The general theoretical expression for the resonant frequencies, applying to
                         a cylindrical dielectric resonator of radius a and height d, is

                   c  mn 2 +  l2  (5.35)
     fmnl =            a      d,

                2 r

     where the integer l denotes the number of half wavelengths in the vertical
     direction and mn is the mth extremum of the Bessel function Jn for a TM
     mode (or alternatively the mth zero for a TE mode).
     Figure 5-18(d) shows a common use of a dielectric resonator, often called a
     puck, coupling to the fields of a microstrip line. The puck has a resonance
     defined by the radius of the high permittivity puck. There can be several
     modes of resonance, with some modes introducing a parallel resonant circuit
     (Figure 5-18(e)) in shunt across the line and others introducing a series
     resonant circuit in shunt across the line (Figure 5-18(f)).

     5.8 Magnetic Transformer

     In this section the use of magnetic transformers in microwave circuits will be
     discussed. Magnetic transformers can be used directly up to a few hundred
     megahertz or so, but the same transforming properties can be achieved using
     coupled transmission lines.

5.8.1 Properties of a Magnetic Transformer

A magnetic transformer (see Figure 5-19) magnetically couples the current
in one wire to current in another. The effect is amplified using coils of wires
and using a core of magnetic material (material with high permeability)
to create greater magnetic flux density. When coils are used, the symbol
shown in Figure 5-19(a) is used, with one of the windings called the primary
winding and the other called the secondary winding. If there is a magnetic
core around which the coils are wound, then the symbol shown in Figure
5-19(b) is used, with the vertical lines indicating the core. However, even
if there is a core, the simpler transformer symbol in Figure 5-19(a) is more
commonly used. Magnetic cores are useful up to several hundred megahertz
and rely on the alignment of magnetic dipoles in the core material. Above
a few hundred megahertz the magnetic dipoles cannot react quickly enough
and so the core looks like an open circuit to magnetic flux. Thus the core is not
useful for magnetically coupling signals above a few hundred megahertz. As
mentioned, the dots above the coils in Figure 5-19(a) indicate the polarity of
the magnetic flux with respect to the currents in the coils so that, as shown,
V1 and V2 will have the same sign. Even if the magnetic polarity is not
specifically shown, it is implied (see Figure 5-19(c)). There are two ways
of showing inversion of the magnetic polarity, as shown in Figure 5-19(d),
where a negative number of windings indicates opposite magnetic polarity.
The interest in using magnetic transformers in high-frequency circuit design
is that configurations of magnetic transformers can be realized using
coupled transmission lines to extend operation to hundreds of gigahertz.
The transformer is easy to conceptualize, so it is convenient to first develop a
circuit using the transformer and then translate it to transmission line form.
That is, in "back-of-the-envelope" microwave design, transformers can be
used to indicate coupling, with the details of the coupling left until later
when the electrical design is translated into a physical design. Restrictions
must be followed as not all transformer configurations can be translated this
134          STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

     way. Transformer characteristics are developed below.          (5.36)
     The following notation is used with a magnetic transformer:

      L1, L2: the self-inductances of the two coils
      M : the mutual inductance
      k: the coupling factor,

                                               k = M .
                                                        L1L2

     Referring to Figure 5-19(e), the voltage transformer ratio is

                 V2 = nV1,                                          (5.37)

     where n is the ratio of the number of secondary to primary windings. An
     ideal transformer has "perfect coupling," indicated by k = 1, and the self-
     inductances are proportional to the square of the number of windings, so

                 V2 = L2 .                                          (5.38)
                 V1     L1

     The general equation relating the currents of the circuit in Figure 5-19(e) is

             RI2 + L2I2 + M I1 = 0,                                 (5.39)
                                                                    (5.40)
     and so      I1 = - R + L2 .
                 I2                  M

     If R  L2, then the current transformer ratio is

             I1  - L2 = - L2 .                                      (5.41)
             I2      M               L1

     Notice that combining Equations (5.38) and (5.41) leads to calculation of the
     transforming effect on impedance. On the Coil 1 side, the input impedance
     is (referring to Figure 5-19(e))

             Zin = V1 = - V2 L1 = R L1 .                            (5.42)
             I1      I2 L2                            L2

     In practice, however, there is always some magnetic field leakage--not all
     of the magnetic field created by the current in Coil 1 goes through (or links)
     Coil 2--and so k < 1. Then from Equations (5.38)-(5.42),

             V1 = L1I1 + M I2                                       (5.43)
              0 = RI2 + L2I2 + M I1.                                (5.44)

     Again, assuming that R  L2, a modified expression for the input
     impedance is obtained that accounts for nonideal coupling:

             Zin = R L1 + L1(1 - k2).                               (5.45)
                       L2

     Imperfect coupling, k < 1, causes the input impedance to be reactive and this
     limits the bandwidth of the transformer. Stray capacitance is another factor
     that impacts the bandwidth of the transformer.

5.9 Hybrids

Hybrids are transformers that combine or divide microwave signals among
a number of inputs and outputs. They can be implemented using distributed
or lumped elements and are not restricted to RF and microwave applications.
For example, a magnetic transformer is a hybrid and can be used to combine
the outputs of two or more transistor stages, or to obtain appropriate
impedance levels. A 3 dB directional coupler based on parallel coupled lines
is also a type of hybrid. Specific implementations will be considered later in
this chapter, but for now the focus is on their idealized characteristics. The
symbols commonly used for hybrids are shown in Figure 5-20.
A hybrid is a special type of four-port junction with the property that if
a signal is applied at any port, it emerges from two of the other ports at
half power, while there is no signal at the fourth or isolated port. The two
outputs have specific phase relationships and all ports are matched. Only
two fundamental types of hybrids are used: 180 and 90 hybrids. A hybrid
is a type of directional coupler, although the term directional coupler, or
just coupler, is most commonly used to refer to devices where only a small
fraction of the power of an input signal is sampled. Also, a balun is a special
type of hybrid.

     5.9.1 Quadrature Hybrid

     The ideal 90 hybrid, or quadrature hybrid, shown in Figure 5-20(c), has the
     scattering parameters

                               0 - 1 0 

                       1         -                0 0 -  0 0 1 .
     S90 =                                        1 - 0                 (5.46)
                       21
                                            0

     The 90 phase difference between the through and coupled ports is indicated
     by -. The actual phase shift, that is, +90 or -90 (indicated by ), between

     the input and output ports depends on the specific hybrid implementation.

     Another quadrature hybrid could have the parameters

                                 0  1 0

                              1                   0  0  1  
                       S90 =                               .            (5.47)
                              2 100
                                               010

     Recall the requirement of quadrature modulators that the local oscillator be
     supplied as two components equal in magnitude but 90 out of phase. A

     quadrature hybrid is just the circuit that can do this.

     To convince yourself that Equation (5.47) describes a network that splits the

     power, consider the power flow implied by Equation (5.47). The fraction of
     power transmitted from Port i to Port j is described by |Sji|2. Consider the
     power that enters Port 1. No power is reflected for an ideal hybrid, as the
     input at Port 1 is matched and S11 = 0. Port 4 should be isolated so no power
     will come out of Port 4, and so S41 = 0. The power should be split between
     Ports 2 and 3, and these should be equal to half the power entering Port 1.

     From Equation (5.47),

     2  1 1 2                                        2  1 1 2
     |S21| =  || = 2 and |S31| =  |1| = 2 .                             (5.48)
     2                                                     2

     Thus the power entering Port 1 is split, with half going to Port 2 and half to
     Port 3.

     5.9.2 180 Hybrid

     The scattering parameters of the 180 hybrid, shown in Figure 5-20(b), are

                              0                   1 -1 0 
                                                  0 0 1  0 0 1 ,
                       1 1                        1 10
     S180 =                                                             (5.49)
                              2 -1

                                               0

     and this defines the operation of the hybrid. In terms of the root power waves

     a and b, the outputs at the ports are

                                                                        (5.50)
     b1 = (a2 - a3)/ 2                            b2 = (a1 + a4)/2 .
     b3 = (-a1 + a4)/ 2                           b4 = (a2 + a3)/ 2

     Imperfections in fabricating the hybrid will result in nonzero scattering
     parameters at the ports where ideally Sji = 0, so that it is best to terminate

the isolated port of the hybrid, as shown in Figure 5-20(d), to ensure that
there is no reflected signal (i.e., no a4) entering the hybrid at the isolated
port. Equation (5.50) shows that ports are interchangeable. That is, if a signal
is applied to Port 3, then it is split between Ports 1 and 4, and Port 2 becomes
the isolated port.
A hybrid can be used in applications other than splitting the input signal
into a through and a coupled component. An example of another use is in a
system that combines or compares two signals, as in Figure 5-21. Here a 180
hybrid with the scattering parameters of Equation (5.49) is shown. With a
signal x(t) applied to Port 2 in Figure 5-20(b), and another signal y(t) applied
to Port 3, the output at Port 4 is the sum signal, x(t) + y(t), and the output
at Port 1 is the difference signal, x(t) - y(t). More common names for the
output ports (when the 180 hybrid is used as a combiner) are to call Port 4
the sigma or sum port, often designated using the symbol . Port 1 is called
the difference or delta port, . Notice that if a signal is applied to the  port
it will generate out-of-phase outputs.

5.9.3 Magnetic Transformer Hybrid

In the hybrid circuits of Figures 5-22 and 5-23, the number of windings
of each coil (there are three in each structure) is the same. The impedance
levels given are those required for maximum power transfer and indicate
the impedance transformations of the structures. Considering Figure 5-23
and equating powers,

1 (2V )2 1 V 2      4 = 1,  and so Z2 = 4Z0.  (5.51)
          =2 ,      Z2 Z0
2 Z2  Z0

That is, if Z2 = 4Z0, the impedance seen looking into Port 4 (of the
transformer in Figure 5-23) is Z0, and so the transformer has provided
matching to the large load. For example, if Z2 = 200  (perhaps the input
of a transistor), the transformer matches this to 50 .

antenna could be attached to Port 1. A common flux passes through the three coils.

EXAMPLE 5.2 Magnetic Transformer Hybrid

     Consider the magnetic transformer hybrid of Figure 5-22(a) with Z0 real. Determine what
     type of hybrid this is and calculate the impedance transformations. Assume ideal coupling
     (k = 1).

     Solution:

     Since the coupling is ideal and each coil has the same number of windings,

          (V3 - V2) = V1 and (V2 - V4) = V1.                                (5.52)

     The current levels in the transformer depend on the attached circuitry. For this circuit to

     function as a hybrid with Port 2 isolated, the current I2 must be zero so that I3 and I4 are
     equal in magnitude but 180 out of phase. The loading at Ports 3 and 4 must be the same.

     Now V2 = 0, since I2 = 0, and so Equation (5.52) become

                                                V3 = V1 and V4 = -V1,       (5.53)
     so this circuit is a 180 hybrid.
PASSIVE COMPONENTS                                                                               139

To determine loading conditions at Ports 2, 3, and 4 the following transformer equation is
used:

                       V3 = L2I3 + M I1 - M I4,                                      (5.54)

where L2 is the inductance of Coil 2 and M is the mutual inductance. Now I1 = -V1/Z0,
L2 = L3 = M since coupling is ideal, and V3 = V1. So Equation (5.54) becomes

                 V3 = M (2I3 - V3/Z0). That is, V3(1 + M/Z0) = 2M I3.                (5.55)

If M |Z0|, this reduces to Zx = V3/I3 = 2Z0.                                         (5.56)

For maximum power transfer Z3 = Zx, but since Z0 is real, Z3 = Zx = 2Z0. From symmetry,
Z4 = Z3. Also, I3 = -I4 = I1/2.

(The above result can also be obtained by considering only maximum power transfer

considerations. The argument is as follows. An impedance Z0 is attached to Coil 1. Maximum

power transfer to the transformer through the coil requires that the input impedance be Z0

(since it is real). In the ideal hybrid operation the power is split evenly between the powers

delivered to the loads at Ports 3 and 4, since V1 = (V3 - V2) = (V2 - V4) and the power

delivered to Coil 1 is V12/(2Z0). The power delivered to Z3 (and Z4) is (V3 - V2)2/(2Z3) =
V12/(2Z3) = V12/(4Z0). That is, Z3 = 2Z0 = Z4. It is a small extrapolation to say that
            
Z3  =         =  Z4.)
       2Z0

The problem is not yet finished, as Z2 must be determined. For hybrid operation, a signal
applied to Port 2 should not have a response at Port 1. So the current at Port 2, I2, should be
split between Coils 2 and 3 so that I3 = -I2/2 = I4. Thus

                       V4 = -I4(2Z0) = (I2/2)(2Z0) = I2Z0 = V3.                      (5.57)

Now           V3 - V2 = V1 = 0 = V2 - V4,  and so  V2 = V4 = I2Z0.                   (5.58)
That is,            Z2 = V2/I2 = Z0.                                                 (5.59)

The final 180 hybrid circuit is shown in Figure 5-22(b) with the loading conditions for
matched operation as a hybrid.

In the example above it is seen that the number of windings in the coils are
the same so that the current in Coils 2 and 3 (of the transformer in Figure 5-
22) is half that in Coil 1. The general rule is that with an ideal transformer, the
sum of the amp-turns around the magnetic circuit must be zero. The precise
way the sum is calculated depends on the direction of the windings indicated
by the "dot" convention. A generalization of the rule for the transformer
shown in Figure 5-22 is

                       n1I1 - n2I2 - n3I3 = 0,                      (5.60)

where nj is the number of windings of Coil j with current Ij. The example
serves to illustrate the type of thinking behind the development of many
RF circuits. Considering maximum power transfer provided an alternative,
simpler start to the solution of the problem than one that used the full
transformer equations.

5.10 Baluns

A balun [16, 17] is a structure that joins balanced and unbalanced
circuits. The word itself (balun) is a contraction of balanced-to-unbalanced

              ground. Instead, the antenna should be electrically isolated from the ground
              (i.e., balanced). The antenna would usually be fed by a coaxial cable with its
              outer conductor connected to ground, and so a balun is required between the
              cable and the antenna.
              A balun is a key component of many RF and microwave communications
              systems [18, 19]. Baluns are used in balanced circuits, such as antennas,
              double-balanced mixers, push-pull amplifiers, and frequency doublers [20].
              Another application of a balun is in a system using RFICs, where a balun
              transforms the differential outputs of an RFIC to unbalanced microwave
              circuitry. The schematic of a magnetic transformer used as a balun is shown
              in Figure 5-25(a) with one terminal of the unbalanced port grounded. Figure
              5-24(b) is the standard schematic symbol for a balun and its use with a
              dipole antenna is shown in Figure 5-24(c). The second port is floating and
              is not referenced to ground. An example of the use of a balun is shown in
              Figure 5-25(b), where the amplifier is called a single-ended amplifier and its
              output is unbalanced, being referred to ground. A balun transitions from the
              unbalanced transistor output to a balanced output.

              5.10.1 Marchand Balun

              The most common form of microwave balun is the Marchand balun [16, 20-
              23]. An implementation of the Marchand balun using coaxial transmission
              lines is shown in Figure 5-26(a) [24]. It can also be realized in planar form
              [16]. The Z02 line acts as both a series stub and a shunt stub. Thus the model
              of the Marchand balun is as shown in Figure 5-26(b).
              The drawback of the conventional Marchand balun is that the center
              frequency of the balun is actually the resonant frequency of the transmission

line resonators forming the balun. Thus the overall size of a conventional
Marchand balun can be large, with the size determined by the transmission
line sections, which are one-quarter wavelength long at the balun center
frequency. Network synthesis can lead to miniaturized baluns by shifting the
one-quarter wavelength frequency up while maintaining the balun center
frequency [23].

5.11 Combiners and Dividers

Combiners are used to combine power from two or more sources. A typical
use is to combine power from two high power amplifiers to obtain a higher
power than would be otherwise be available. Dividers divide power so that
the power from an amplifier can be routed to different parts of a circuit.

5.11.1 Wilkinson Combiner and Divider

The Wilkinson divider can be used as a combiner or divider that divides
input power among the output ports [25]. Figure 5-27(a) is a two-way divider
that splits the power at Port 1 equally between the two output ports at Ports
2 and 3. A particular insight that Wilkinson brought was the introduction of
the resistor between the output ports and this acts to suppress any imbalance
between the output signals due to nonidealities. If the division is exact, no
current will flow in the resistor. The circuit works less well as a general
purpose combiner. Ideally power entering Ports 2 and 3 would combine
losslessly and appear at Port 1. A typical application is to combine the power
at the output of two matched transistors where the amplitude and the phase

                 of the signals can be expected to be closely matched. However, if the signals
                 are not identical, power will be absorbed in the resistor. The bandwidth of the
                 Wilkinson combiner/divider is limited by the one-quarter wavelength long
                 lines. However, the bandwidth is relatively large, approaching 50% [25].
                 Arbitrary power ratios can also be obtained [26-28].
                 The operation of the Wilkinson divider can be seen by deriving the input
                 impedance of the two-way Wilkinson divider driven at Port 1 (see Figure
                 5-27(e)). Since the Wilkinson divider is driven, the signals at Ports 2 and 3
                 will be identical, so it is as though the resistor in the Wilkinson divider is
                 not there. The input impedance of one of the one-quarter wavelength long
                 sections in Figure 5-27(e) is

                                   2Z02               (5.61)
                            Z1 = Z0 = 2Z0,

                 and so the Wilkinson model reduces to that in Figure 5-27(f). The two 2Z0
                 resistors are in parallel, resulting in the further model reductions in Figures
                 5-27(g) and 5-27(h). Thus Port 1 is matched. A similar analysis shows that
                 Ports 2 and 3 are matched (have an input impedance of Z0). The S parameters
                 of the two-way Wilkinson power divider with an equal split of the output
                 power are therefore

                                                      (5.62)

                 can be repeated to produce N -way power dividing. The lumped-element
                 version of the Wilkinson divider shown in Figure 5-27(c) is based on the LC
                 model of a one-quarter wavelength long transmission line segment. With a
                 50  system impedance and center frequency of 400 MHz, the elements of
                 the lumped element are (from Figure 2-37(c)) L = 28.13 nH, C1 = 11.25 pF, C2
                 = 5.627 pF, and R = 100 .
                 Figure 5-28(a) is the layout of a direct microstrip realization of a Wilkinson
                 divider. The obvious problem is how to incorporate the resistor. As long as
                 the resistor is placed symmetrically this is not as severe a problem as it would
                 initially seem, as power is not dissipated in the resistor unless there is an
                 imbalance. A higher-performance microstrip layout is shown in Figure 5-
                 28(b), where the transmission lines are curved to bring the output ports near
                 each other so that a chip resistor can be used.

EXAMPLE 5.3 Lumped-Element Wilkinson Divider

Design a lumped-element 2-way Wilkinson divider in a 60  system. The center frequency
of the design should be 10 GHz.

Solution:

The design begins with the transmission line form of the Wilkinson

divider which will be converted to a lumped-element form latter. The

design parameters are Z0 = 60 , f = 10 GHz,  = 21010 =

2.283  1010 rads/s and so 
           Z01 = 2Z0 = 84.85 , R = 2Z0 = 120 .                                               ,

The next stage is to convert the transmission lines to lumped elements. A broadband design
of a quarter-wavelength transmission line was presented in Figure 2-37(b) of [15]. That is,
each of the quarter-wave lines has the model

                                                    with L = Z01/ = 84.85/ = 954.9 pH,
                                                    C = 1/(Z01) = 1/(84.85) = 265.3 fF.
So the final lumped element design is

                             with
                             C1 = 2C = 530.6 fF,
                             C2 = C = 265.3 fF,
                             L = 954.9 pH,
                             R = 120 .

5.11.2 Chireix Combiner

One of the problems with the Wilkinson structure when it is used as a
combiner is that it is only efficient at combining when the two signals to be
combined are in phase. A better combiner is the Chireix combiner [29] shown
in Figure 5-29. This combiner is often used when combining the outputs of
two amplifiers achieving efficient combining even when the signals to be
combined are not identical [30-33].

5.12 Transmission Line Transformer

One of the challenges in RF engineering is achieving broadband operation
of transformers from megahertz up to several gigahertz. In this section,
several structures are presented that operate as magnetic transformers at
frequencies below several hundred megahertz but as coupled transmission
line structures at high frequencies. A transformer that achieves this and,

     in this configuration, realizes a balun is shown in Figure 5-30(a). Below a
     few hundred megahertz this functions as a magnetic transformer. Above
     this frequency the ferrite core cannot respond to the signal and the
     magnetic circuit through the core appears as an open circuit. Then, since the
     transformer is not operating as a magnetic transformer anymore, magnetic
     leakage is inconsequential. At high frequencies the wire transmission lines
     are closely coupled and appear as a perfect coupler if the lines (or wires here)
     are long enough. The equivalent circuit of this structure is shown in Figure 5-
     30(b). At high frequencies, stray capacitances between the windings becomes
     important but become part of the transmission line capacitance. Many types
     of transformers operating from several megahertz to several gigahertz can
     be realized using the same principle and are available as surface-mount
     components (see Figure 5-30(c)).
     High-frequency coupling is enhanced by twisting the conductors as shown
     in Figure 5-31. The combination of magnetic coupling at low frequencies
     with transmission line coupling at high frequencies yields a transformer that
     operates over very wide bandwidths.

5.12.1 Transmission Line Transformer as a Balun

The schematic of a broadband 1:1 RF balun is shown in Figure 5-30(b) and a
realization of it is shown in Figure 5-30(a and c). The 1:1 designation indicates
that there is no impedance transformation. The circuit equations describing
this balun are (from the ABCD parameters of a transmission line; see Table
2-1)

  Va = Vbcos() + IbZ0 sin() and Ia = Ibcos() +  Vb sin() (5.63)
                                                                             Z0

and the load resistance creates a third equation,

                              Vb = IbR.                    (5.64)

The aim in the following is the development of a design equation that
describes the essential properties of the structure. Substituting Equation
(5.64) in Equation (5.63) leads to

Va = Vb cos() +  Z0 sin()     and Ia = Vb cos() +  R sin() .
                           R             R            Z0

                                                           (5.65)

Choosing Z0 = R yields (since e = cos() +  sin())          (5.66)
                          Va = Vbe and Ia = (Vb/R)e,

and so

                    Zin = Va/Ia = R.                       (5.67)

This analysis is idealized, as parasitics are eliminated (mainly parasitic
capacitances), but the above equation indicates that the essential function
of the structure is that of a balun with no impedance transformation.
The transformer arrangement shown in Figure 5-30(b) is of particular interest
as it can be realized using coupled transmission lines.

5.12.2 4:1 Impedance Transformer at High Frequencies

By changing the connection of the transformer terminals it is possible to
achieve impedance transformation. A 4:1 impedance transformer is shown
in Figure 5-32(a). A specific arrangement of the primary and secondary
windings puts this into what is called the transmission line form, shown
in Figure 5-33. At high frequencies port conditions are enforced so that the
currents at Ports 1 and 3 (and at Ports 2 and 4) are matched, as shown in
Figure 5-33. Showing that Zin = R begins with

Va = Vb cos() + IbZ0 sin(), Ia = Ib cos() +  Vb Z0 sin(),  (5.68)
Vin = Va + R(Ia + Ib), and Vb = (Ia + Ib)R.

So the aim is to find Zin = Vin/Ia, as this defines the required electrical
function. Now

        Vin = Va + Vb = Vb[1 + cos()] + IbZ0 sin(),        (5.69)

                                                                             Z0

                Thus

                           Zin = Vin = Z0 2R[1 + cos()] + Z0 sin() .                  (5.71)

                At very low frequencies the electrical length of the transmission line, , is
                negligibly small and Zin = 4R. To see what happens when the length of
                the transmission line has a significant effect, consider the special case when
                Z0 = 2R, then

                                                  Zin = 2R(1 + e-).                   (5.72)

                For a short line, that is,  < 0.1 or  < 0.2, Equation (5.72) can be
                approximated as

                           Zin  2R[1 + 1 - ] = 4R - R(2).                             (5.73)

                The imaginary component, -R2, is a capacitance and it must be
                resonated out (e.g., by a series inductor) to obtain the required resistance
                transformation.
                The general approach described above can be used to design transformers
                with higher impedance ratios. Two more, a 9:1 transformer and a 16:1
                transformer, are shown in Figure 5-34.

5.12.3 4:1 Impedance Transformer at Low Frequencies

In the previous section it was shown that the impedance transformer in
Figure 5-32(a) acts as a 4:1 impedance transformer at high frequencies where
the structure can be considered to be a transmission line. In this section it
will be shown that the transformer is also a 4:1 impedance transformer at
low frequencies where the structure can be considered to be a wire-wound
transformer.
At low frequencies, the port conditions1 at the ends of the transmission
line are not enforced and so a better low frequency representation of
the transformer currents is shown in Figure 5-35. If at low frequencies
the transformer of Figure 5-33 has a self-inductance of Ls and a mutual
inductance of M , then the circuit equations for the transformer are

Vin - Vb = LsIa - M Ib                                  (5.74)
       Vb = -LsIb + M Ia                                (5.75)
       Vb = (Ia + Ib)R.                                 (5.76)

          Replacing Ib in Equation (5.78) using Equation (5.77) yields

                          Vin = (R + Ls) -  (R - M )2    Ia.                 (5.79)

                                            R + Ls

          Thus the input impedance is

          Z V in = in = R2 + 2RLs - (Ls)2 - R2 + 2RM + (M )2 .               (5.80)
          Ia                           R + Ls

          If ideal coupling is assumed (i.e., M = Ls) then Equation (5.80) reduces to

                                       Zin = 4RLs .                          (5.81)
                                               R + Ls

          If Ls  R, then

                                       Zin  4R.                              (5.82)

          Thus the transformer is a 4:1 impedance transformer both at low frequencies
          when the structure acts as a magnetic transformer and, as seen in Section
          5.12.2, at higher frequencies when the structure acts like a transmission
          line. Design of the impedance transformer is then directed at managing
          the frequency transition region and ensuring that the required impedance
          transformation occurs there as well. In practice, very broadband operation is
          not difficult to achieve.

          5.12.4 Hybrid Transformer Used as a Combiner

          In Figure 5-36(a) a 180 hybrid transformer is used to combine the outputs of
          two power amplifiers that are driven 180 out of phase with respect to each
          other. This is commonly done when the power available from just one solid-
          state transistor amplifier is not sufficient to meet power requirements. Since
          the sum of the amp-turns of an ideal transformer must be zero,

                                       nIo = m(I1 + I2)                      (5.83)
PASSIVE COMPONENTS                                                                            149

and I1 = I2 since the two amplifiers are driven identically but 180 out of
phase. Then Vh = 0, V1 = V2 = (m/n)Vo, and both power amplifiers deliver
equal power to the load. Also, each amplifier sees a load impedance

                    Rin = V1 =   m 22R0.              (5.84)
                             I1  n

EXAMPLE 5.4 Transformer Design

      The Thevenin equivalent output impedance of each amplifier in Figure 5-36(a) is 1  and
      the system impedance, R0, is 50 . Choose the transformer windings for maximum power
      transfer.

      Solution:

      For maximum power transfer, Rin = 1 , and so from Equation (5.84),

                       1 = m 2  2  50 and m = 0.1.                         (5.85)
                       n                      n

      Thus with a 10:1 winding ratio the required impedance transformation can be achieved.

5.12.5 Hybrid Transformer Used as a Power Splitter

The hybrid transformer can also be used to split power from a source to
drive two loads. The circuit of Figure 5-36(b) splits power from a current
source driver into two loads. With the number of primary and secondary
windings equal (i.e., m = n), the circuit equations are

      I = I1 + I2, V1 = V + Vh, and V2 = Vh - V.      (5.86)

Thus  V1 - Vh = Vh - V2.                              (5.87)

Using V1 = R1I1, V2 = -I2R2, and Vh = (I2 - I1)Rh, the desired electrical
characteristics of the splitter are obtained:

                       I2 = R1 + 2Rh .                (5.88)
                       I1 R2 + 2Rh

Several observations can be made about the performance of the power
splitter. If R1 = R2, then I1 = I2 for any value of Rh. Conversely, if
R1 = R2, I1 = I2 for a finite Rh. To obtain equal drive currents in both
power amplifiers in spite of variations in R1 and R2, the center tap of the
transformer needs to be omitted so that Rh = .

5.12.6 Broadband Hybrid Combiner

A broadband hybrid combiner is shown in Figure 5-37. In what follows, it is
shown that this combiner has the property of accommodating mismatches of
the amplifiers. The development begins by assuming that the transformers
have an equal number of turns on each winding. These two transformers are
used to make a broadband (transmission line transformer) hybrid coupler.
The circuit equations are

      I1 = Ia + Ib and I2 = Ia - Ib,                  (5.89)
                                                      (5.90)
      Ia = 1 (I1 + I2) and Ib = 1 (I1 - I2),          (5.91)
      2                                 2

      V1 = Vo + Vh and V2 = Vo - Vh.

     Thus

                                      V1 = Rh  1 - I2   + R0   1 - I2                  (5.92)
                                      I1            I1      2       I1                 (5.93)

                                      V2 = R0  1 + I1   - Rh   I1 - 1 .
                                      I2 2          I2         I2

     A special situation is when Rh = R0/2, and then V2/I2 = R0 and V1/I1 = R0.
     Thus each of the amplifiers sees a constant load resistance, R0, even if the
     amplifiers are mismatched, resulting, for example, when the amplifiers have
     slightly different gains.

     5.13 Transmission Line-Based Hybrids

     Hybrids can be realized in a variety of transmission line structures. A
     few of these, but representative ones, are discussed here. Hybrids can
     also be realized using lumped-elements by modeling the transmission line
     segments.

     5.13.1 Branch-Line Hybrids Based on Transmission Lines

     A branch-line hybrid is based on transmission line segments that introduce
     phase delay. Two such hybrids are shown in Figure 5-38 where the different
     signal paths result in constructive and destructive interference of signals.
     This is a very different way of realizing the hybrid function than that
     obtained using magnetic transformers. The operation of the 180 hybrid
     (Figure 5-38(a)) can be verified approximately by counting the total number
     of one-quarter wavelength (90) phase shifts in each path. It is not so
     easy to verify the operation of the 90 hybrid. The various characteristic
     impedances of the transmission line segments adjust the levels of the signals.
     The operation of the 90 hybrid is examined in the example in this section.
     (A complete analysis could be done using signal flow graphs.)

                                                                               (b) transmission

These branch-line hybrids may be formed into a ring shape, as shown in

Figure 5-39. It is also worth considering the so-called rat-race or hybrid-

ring circuit shown in Figure 5-40(a). Output signals from Ports 2 and 4
differ in phase by 180 (in contrast to the branch-line coupler, where the
phase difference is 90). An interesting and important design feature arises

when considering the quarter-wave transformer action of this coupler. Only

Ports 2 and 4 exhibit this action, because Port 3 is half-wave separated

from the input feeding Port 1. Thus the net effective load on the inner
ring lines feeding Ports 2 and 4 amounts to 2Z0 (two Z0 loads appearing,
equivalently, in series). Now the characteristic impedance Z0 of any quarter-
wave transforming line between two impedances, Z01 and Z02, is equal to

  Z01Z02. In this case the two impedances are Z0 and 2Z0, respectively, so
(from Section 2.4.6 of [15]) the input impedance of the intervening quarter-

wave line is

                    =                        (5.94)
                       Z0  2Z0 = 2Z0.
              Z0

EXAMPLE 5.5                                                                                                   
             Thus the characteristic impedance of the line forming the ring itself is 2
             times that of the feeder line impedances. So when the impedance of all ports
             is 50 , the ring characteristic impedance is 70.7 .

               Rat-Race Hybrid

     In this example the rat-race circuit shown in Figure 5-40(a) is considered. One of the
     functions of this circuit is that with an input at Port 1, the power of this signal is split between
     Ports 3 and 4. At the same time, no signal appears at Port 2. This example is an exercise in
     exploiting the impedance transformation properties of the transmission line.

        From Figure 5-40(a) it is seen that each port is separated from the other port by a specific
     electrical length. Intuitively one can realize that there will be various possible outputs for
     excitation from different ports. Each case will be studied.

        When Port 1 of the hybrid is excited or driven, the outputs at Ports 3 and 4 are in phase, as
     both are distanced from Port 1 by an electrical length of g/4, while Port 2 remains isolated,
     as the electrical length of the two paths from Port 1 to Port 2 differ by an even multiple of
     g/2. Thus Port 2 will be an electrical short circuit to the signal at Port 1.

         In a similar way, a signal excited at Port 2 will result in outputs at Ports 3 and 4, though
     with a phase difference of 180 between the two output ports and Port 1 remains isolated.

         Finally, a signal excited at Ports 3 and 4 will result in the sum of the two signals at Port
     1 and the difference of two signals at Port 2. This combination of output is again due to
     varying electrical length between every port and every other port in the rat-race hybrid. The
     equivalent transmission line model and equivalent circuit of the rat-race hybrid are shown
     in Figures 5-40(b and c), respectively.

             5.13.2 Lumped-Element Hybrids

             Hybrids are developed based on transmission line principles, but it is
             possible to create hybrids using lumped-element equivalents of transmission
             line segments. In some cases the full circle of design can begin with the
             magnetic transformer conceptualization, followed by a transmission line
             realization, and then a lumped-element approximation. At least this is valid
             over a bandwidth centered at a particular frequency, f = 0/(2). The
             lumped-element equivalent of the 180 hybrid in Figure 5-38(a) is shown
             in Figure 5-41(a) with

             0L = 1 = 2Z0.                                                                                 (5.95)
                      0C

             This result comes from the broadband equivalent circuit of a /4 line shown
             in Figure 2-37. The lumped-element quadrature hybrid of Figure 5-41(b),
             based on Figure 5-38(b), has

                                              1    Z0

5.14 Summary

This chapter introduced the richness of microwave components available
to the RF designer. Microwave lumped-element R, L, and C components
are carefully constructed so that they function as intended up to 20 GHz
or so. They are usually in surface-mount form so that they can be
integrated in design without the parasitic effects of leads. To a limited
extent, transmission line discontinuities can be used as small-valued lumped
elements. Even if the transmission line discontinuities are not specifically
introduced for this purpose, their lumped-element equivalent circuits must
be included in circuit analysis. Transmission line stubs are widely used
to introduce capacitance and inductance in circuits. In most transmission
line technologies only shunt stubs are available, and thus there is a strong
preference for shunt elements in circuit designs. Many functionalities can
be developed using the interactions of forward- and backward-traveling
waves on transmission lines. Classic examples seen in this chapter are the
combiners and hybrids. Sometimes the functionality can only be visualized
using transmission line structures. Then coming full circle, lumped-element
equivalents can be realized.
There are many more passive components in the repertoire of the
RF designer. However, this chapter reviewed the most important and
introduced the concepts that can be used to analyze other structures
and to invent new ones. Each year new variants of microwave elements
are developed and documented in patents and publications. Microwave
engineers monitor these developments, especially in their field of expertise.

6.1 Introduction

The maximum transfer of signal power is one of the prime objectives in RF
and microwave circuit design. Power traverses a network from a source to a
load generally through a sequence of two-port networks. Maximum power
transfer requires that the Thevenin equivalent impedance of a source be
matched to the impedance seen from the source. That is, the source should
be presented with the complex conjugate of the source impedance. This is
achieved by designing what is called a matching network inserted between
the source and load. As long as the load has some nonzero real part (and so
can dissipate power), a matching network can always be found. Design of
the matching network is called impedance matching.
Section 6.2 describes two common matching objectives. Then design
approaches for impedance matching are presented first with an algorithmic
approach in Sections 6.3-6.6 and then a graphical approach based on using a
Smith chart in Sections 6.7-6.9.

6.2 Matching Networks

Matching networks are constructed using lossless elements such as lumped
capacitors, lumped inductors and transmission lines and so have, ideally,
no loss and introduce no additional noise. This section discusses matching
objectives and the types of matching networks.

                                                                                      in  =
                                                                                               S

     6.2.1 Matching for Zero Reflection or for Maximum Power
              Transfer

     With RF circuits the aim of matching is to achieve maximum power transfer.

     With reference to Figure 6-1 the condition for maximum power transfer

     is Zin  =     Z    (see Section 2.6.2 of [1]). An alternative matching objective,

                     S

     used most commonly with digital circuits, is a reflection-less match. The

     reflection-less match and the maximum power transfer match are only

     equivalent if ZS and ZL are real. Nearly always in RF design the matching

     objective is maximum power transfer, and this is assumed unless the

     reflection-less match is specifically indicated.

     The maximum power transfer matching condition can also be specified in

     terms of reflection coefficients with respect to an real reference impedance

     ZREF. (In the definition of reflection coefficient ZREF can be complex, but

     many of the manipulations in this book only apply when ZREF is real and

     this should be assumed unless it is specifically stated that it can be complex.)

     The  condition     for  maximum         power      transfer     is  Zin  =  Z    which    is  equivalent

     to in = S. The proof is as follows:                                           S

                                             in = Zin - ZREF ,                                     (6.1)
                                                       Zin + ZREF

     and for maximum power transfer Zin = ZS, so

                         Zin - ZREF                     Z    -  ZREF      (ZS - Z0)
                   in =                            =                     =
                                                          S

                             Zin + ZREF                 Z    +  ZREF             (ZS + Z0)   

                                                          S

                                             (ZS )    -  Z           ZS  -    Z

                                                           REF                  REF
                                             =   =                                = S.             (6.2)
                                             (ZS ) + ZREF ZS + ZREF

     If  ZREF  is  real,  Z               =  ZREF  and  then    the  condition    for  maximum     power

                            REF

     transfer is

                                              ZS - ZREF
                                             in =                    = S.                          (6.3)
                                                   ZS + ZREF

     Thus, provided that ZREF is real, the condition for maximum power transfer

     in  terms of  reflection coefficients is                   =    S   or   in  =    S. The      matching

                                                           in

     conditions are summarized in Table 6-1.

     6.2.2 Types of Matching Networks

     Up to a few gigahertz, lumped inductors and capacitors can be used in
     matching networks. Above a few gigahertz, distributed parasitics (losses
IMPEDANCE MATCHING                                                                 161

and additional capacitive or inductive effects) can render lumped-element
networks impractical. Inductors in particular have high loss and high
parasitic capacitances at microwave frequencies. Lumped capacitors are
useful circuit elements at much higher frequencies than are lumped
inductors. Segments of transmission lines are used in matching networks
and are used instead of lumped elements when loss must be kept to a
minimum, power levels are high, or the parasitics of lumped elements render
them unusable. This is because the loss of an appropriate transmission line
component is always much less than the loss of a lumped inductor.
Many factors affect the selection of the components of a matching
network. The most important of these are size, complexity, bandwidth, and
adjustability. The impact on a circuit of a distributed element is directly
related to its length compared to one-quarter of a wavelength (/4). At
1 GHz a circuit board, for example, with a relative permittivity of 4 has
/4 = 3.75 cm. This is far too large to fit in consumer wireless products
operating at 1 GHz.
Performance of lumped-element capacitors and inductors refers to both the
self-resonant frequency of an element and its loss. Inductors are a particular
case in point. An actual inductor must be modeled using capacitive elements,
capturing inter-winding capacitance as well as the primary inductive
element. At some frequency the inductive and capacitive elements will
resonate and this is called the self-resonant frequency of the element. The
self-resonant frequency is the maximum operating frequency of the element.
With regards to complexity, the simplest matching network design is most
often preferred. A simpler matching network is usually more reliable, less
lossy, and cheaper than a complex design. The pursuit of small size and/or
higher bandwidth, however, may necessitate that the simplest circuit not be
selected. Any type of matching network can ideally give, ignoring resistive
loses, a perfect match at a single frequency. Away from this center frequency
the match will not be ideal. From experience, achieving a reasonable match
over a 5% fractional bandwidth based on a single-frequency match can
usually be achieved with simple matching networks..
An impedance matching network may consist of

  (a) Lumped elements only. These are the smallest networks, but have
       the most stringent limit on the maximum frequency of operation. The
       relatively high resistive loss of an inductor is the main limiting factor
       limiting performance. The self resonant frequency of an inductor limits
       operation to low microwave frequencies.

  (b) Distributed elements (microstrip or other transmission line circuits)
       only. These have excellent performance, but their size restricts their use
       in systems to above a few gigahertz.

  (c) A hybrid design combining lumped and distributed elements,
       primarily small sections of lines with capacitors. These lines are shorter
       than in a design with distributed elements only, but the hybrid design
       has higher performance than a lumped-element-only design.

  (d) Adhoc solutions (suggested by input impedance behavior and features
       of various components).

This chapter concentrates on matching network design. One emphasis here is
on the development of design equations and synthesis of desired results. The
second emphasis is on graphical techniques for matching network design
based on using A Smith chart. This is particularly power as it enables

     secondary side.

     typologies to traded-off. An alternative design approach used by some
     designers is to choose a circuit topology and then use a circuit optimizer
     to arrive at circuit values that yield the desired characteristics. This is
     sometimes a satisfactory design technique, but is not a good solution for
     new designs as it does not provide insight and does not help in choosing
     new topologies.

     6.2.3 Summary

     There are many design choices in the type of matching network to be
     developed but the common guidelines are to minimize losses and to keep
     the matching network compact. These objectives are not always compatible.
     Matching network design in this chapter is based on perfect matching at
     one frequency and design decisions are made to maximize, or otherwise
     manipulate, the bandwidth of the match. True broadband matching network
     design is more like filter design.

     6.3 Impedance Transforming Networks

     Transformers and reactive elements considered in this section can be used to
     losslessly transform impedance levels. his is a basic aspect of network design.

     6.3.1 The Ideal Transformer

     The ideal transformer shown in Figure 6-2 can be used to match a load to a
     source if the source and load impedances are resistances. This will be shown
     by starting with the constitutive relations of the transformer:

     V1 = nV2 and I1 = -I2/n.                        (6.4)

     Here n is the transformer ratio. For a wire-wound transformer, n is the ratio
     of the number of windings on the primary side, Port 1, to the number of
     windings on the secondary side, Port 2. Thus the input resistance, Rin, is
     related to the load resistance, RL, by

     Rin = V1 = -n2 V2 = n2RL.                       (6.5)
     I1                                          I2

     The matching problem with purely resistive load and source impedances is
     solved by choosing the appropriate winding ratio, n. However, resistive-only
     problems are rare at RF, and so other matching circuits must be used.

     6.3.2 A Series Reactive Element

     Matching using lumped elements is based on the impedance and admittance
     transforming properties of series and shunt reactive elements. Even a single
     reactive element can achieve limited impedance matching. Consider the
     series reactive element shown in Figure 6-3(a). Here the reactive element, XS,
IMPEDANCE MATCHING                                                                           163

is in series with a resistance R. The shunt equivalent of this network is shown
in Figure 6-3(b) with a shunt susceptance of B. In this transformation the
resistance R has been converted to a resistance RP = 1/G. The mathematics
describing this transformation is as follows. The input admittance of the
series connection (Figure 6-3(a)) is

      Yin() = 1 = 1 = 2 2 R -  2 2 XS .                                    (6.6)
                  Zin() R + XS R + XS R + XS

Thus the elements of the equivalent shunt network, Figure 6-3(b), are

      G= 2  R                  and B = - 2 2 XS .                          (6.7)
                                                R + XS
      R + XS        2

The "resistance" of the network, R, has been transformed to a new value,

      RP = G-1 = R2 + XS2 > R.                                             (6.8)
                             R

This is an important start to matching, as XS can be chosen to convert R (a
load, for example) to any desired resistance value (such as the resistance of a
source). However there is still a residual reactance that must be removed to
complete the matching network design. Before moving on to the solution of
this problem consider the following example.

EXAMPLE 6.1 Capacitive Impedance Transformation

Consider the impedance transforming properties of the capacitive series element in Figure
6-4(a). Show that the capacitor can be adjusted to obtain any positive shunt resistance.

Solution:

The concept here is that the series resistor and capacitor network has an equivalent shunt

circuit that includes a capacitor and a resistor. By adjusting CS any value can be obtained

for RP . From Equation (6.8),

            RP =                  2  +  (1/2CS2 )  =    1  +     22     2         (6.9)

                               R0                              CS    R0

                                        R0                    22
                                                            CSR0

and the susceptance is B = 2 2 2 (1/CS ) =  2 2 2 CS .                            (6.10)
                               R0 + 1/ CS             1 +  CSR0

Thus        CP = B =                        2 2 2 CS .                            (6.11)
                                1 +  CSR0

To match R0 to a resistive load RP (> R0) at a radian frequency d, then, from Equation
(6.9), the series capacitance required, i.e. the design equation for CS, comes from

                                     dCS = 1/ R0RP - R02,                         (6.12)

To complete the matching design, use a shunt inductor L, as shown in Figure 6-4(c), where
dCP = 1/(dL). The equivalent impedance in Figure 6-4(c) is a resistor of value RP , with
a value that can be adjusted by choosing CS which then requires L to be adjusted.

          6.3.3 A Parallel Reactive Element

          The dual of the series matching procedure is the use of a parallel reactive
          element, as shown in Figure 6-5(a). The input admittance of the shunt circuit

                                                   Yin = 1 + B.                                        (6.13)
                                                           R

          This can be converted to a series circuit by calculating Zin = 1/Yin:

                Zin = R =                       R                BR2                                   (6.14)
                                                  2 2 -              2 2.                              (6.15)
                        1 + BR 1 + B R 1 + B R

          So RS =                    R                    -BR2
                                        2 2 and XS =             2 2.
                        1+B R                             1+B R

          Notice that RS < R.

EXAMPLE 6.2 Parallel Tuning

     As an example of the use of a parallel reactive element to tune a resistance value, consider
     the circuit in Figure 6-6(a) where a capacitor tunes the effective resistance value so that the
     series equivalent circuit (Figure 6-6(b)) has elements

          RS =    R0                 and XS = -               2        1   .

                   22 2                          CP R0
                                                      2 2 2 =-                     (6.16)
                1 +  CP R0                       1 +  CP R0            CS          (6.17)

                           22 2

                1 +  CP R0
     So   CS = 2      2.
                 CP R0

     Now consider matching R0 to a resistive load RS, which is less than R0 at a given frequency
     d. This requires that

                                              dCP = 1/(RS R0) - 1/R02.

     To complete the design, use a series inductor to remove the reactive effect of the capacitor, as
     shown in Figure 6-6(C). The value of the inductor required is found from

                                 dL = 1 ,       that is,  L = 21 .                 (6.18)

          6.4 The L Matching Network

          The examples in the previous two sections suggest the basic concept behind
          lossless matching of two different resistance levels using an L network:

                                                    of the match is fixed.

Step 1: Use a series (shunt) reactive element to transform a smaller (larger)
       resistance up (down) to a larger (smaller) value with a real part equal
       to the desired resistance value.

Step 2: Use a shunt (series) reactive element to resonate with (or cancel) the
       imaginary part of the impedance that results from Step 1.

So a resistance can be transformed to any resistive value by using an LC
transforming circuit.
Formalizing the matching approach described above, note that there are
four possible two-element L matching networks (see Figure 6-7). The two
possible cases, RS < RL and RL < RS , will be considered in the following
subsections.

             Introducing the quantities

                         QS = the Q of the series leg = |XS/RS|
                         QP = the Q of the shunt leg = |RL/XP |

             leads to the final design equations for RS < RL:

                                          |QS| = |QP | =                        RL - 1.                            (6.24)
                                                                                RS

             The L matching network principle is that XP and XS will be either capacitive
             or inductive and they will have the opposite sign (i.e., the L matching
             network comprises one inductor and one capacitor). Also, once RS and RL
             are given, the Q of the network and thus bandwidth is defined; with the L
             network, the designer does not have a choice of circuit Q.

EXAMPLE 6.3  Matching Network Design

     Design a circuit to match a 100  source to a 1700  load at 900 MHz. Assume that a DC
     voltage must also be transferred from the source to the load.

     Solution:

     Here RS < RL, and so the topology of Figure 6-9(a) can be used and there are two versions,
     one with a series inductor and one with a series capacitor. The series inductor version (see
     Figure 6-9(b)) is chosen as this enables DC bias to be applied. From Equations (6.22)-(6.24)
     the design equations are

     |QS | = |QP | =  1700 - 1 = 16 = 4,  XS = 4, and XS = 4  100 = 400.                                  (6.25)
                      100                 RS

     This indicates that L = 400 , and so the series element is                                            (6.26)
                                                L = 2  9  108 400 = 70.7 nH.

     For the shunt element next to the load, |RL/XC | = 4, and so

Thus 1/C = 425 and C =           1         = 0.416 pF.

equations for the L network for RS > RL are similarly derived and are

EXAMPLE 6.4 Two-Element Matching Network

Design a passive two-element matching network that will achieve maximum power transfer
from a source with an impedance of 50  to a load with an impedance of 75 . Choose a
matching network that will not allow DC to pass.

Solution:

RL > RS, so, from Figure 6-7, the appropriate matching network topology is

                                              This topology can be either high pass or low pass
                                              depending on the choice of XS and XP . Design
                                              proceeds by finding the magnitudes of XS and XP .
                                              In two-element matching the circuit Q is fixed. With
                                              RL = 75  and RS = 50 .

The Q of the matching network is the same for the series and parallel elements:

     |QS| = |XS | =  RL - 1 = 0.7071 and |QP | = RL = |QS | = 0.7071,
                RS   RS                                    |XP |

therefore |XS | = RS  |QS | = 50  0.7071 = 35.35 . Also

                     |XP | = RL/|QP | = 75/0.7071 = 106.1 .

     Specific element types can now be assigned to XS and XP , and note that they must be of
     opposite type.

     The lowpass matching network is  The highpass matching network is

     XS = +35.35 , XP = -106.1 .      XS = -35.35 , XP = +106.1 .

     This highpass design satisfies the design criterion that DC is not passed, as DC is
     blocked by the series capacitor.

     6.5 Dealing with Complex Sources and Loads

     This section presents strategies for dealing with complex loads. In the
     algorithmic matching approach design proceeds first by ignoring the
     complex load and source and then accounting for them either through
     topology choice or canceling their effect through resonance.

     6.5.1 Matching

     Input and output impedances of transistors, mixers, antennas, etc., contain
     both resistive and reactive components. Thus a realistic impedance matching
     problem looks like that shown in Figure 6-11. The matching approaches that
     were presented in the previous sections can be directly applied if XS and XL
     are treated as stray reactances that need to be either canceled or, ideally, used
     as part of the matching network. There are two basic approaches to handling
     complex impedances:

       (a) Absorption: Absorb source and load reactances into the impedance
            matching network itself. This is done through careful placement of
            each matching element such that capacitors are placed in parallel with
            source and load capacitances, and inductors in series with source and
            load inductances. The stray values are then subtracted from the L
            and C values for the matching network calculated on the basis of
            the resistive parts of ZS and ZL only. The new (smaller) values, L
            and C, constitute the elements of the matching network. Sometimes
            it is necessary to perform a series-to-parallel, or parallel-to-series,
            conversion of the source or load impedances so that the reactive
            elements are in the correct series or shunt arrangement for absorption.

       (b) Resonance: Resonate source and load reactances with an equal and
            opposite reactance at the frequency of interest.

     The very presence of a reactance in a load indicates energy storage, and
     therefore bandwidth limiting of some kind. In the above approaches to
     handling a reactive load, the resonance approach could easily result in a
IMPEDANCE MATCHING                                                                           169

narrowband matching solution. The major problem in matching is often to
obtain sufficient bandwidth. What is sufficient will vary depending on the
application. To maximize bandwidth the general goal is to minimize the
total energy storage. Roughly the total energy stored will be proportional
to the sum of the magnitudes of the reactances in the circuit. Of course, the
actual energy storage depends on the voltage and current levels, which will
themselves vary in the circuit. A good approach leading to large bandwidths
is to incorporate the load reactance into the matching network. Thus the
choice of appropriate matching network topology is critical. However, if
the source and load reactance value is larger than the calculated matching
network element value, then absorption on its own cannot be used. In this
situation resonance must be combined with absorption. Overall, the majority
of impedance matching designs are based on some combination of resonance
and absorption.

EXAMPLE 6.5 Matching Network Design Using Resonance

For the configuration shown in Figure 6-12, design an impedance matching network that
will block the flow of DC current from the source to the load. The frequency of operation

is 1 GHz. Design the matching network, neglecting the presence of the 10 pF capacitance at
the load. Since RS = 50  < RL = 500 , and from Figure 6-7, consider the topologies of
Figures 6-13(a) and 6-13(b). The design criterion of blocking flow of DC from the source to
the load narrows the choice to the topology of Figure 6-13(b).

Solution:  |QS| = XS = |QP | = RL =  RL - 1 = 3 and QP = RL .                       (6.31)
Step 1:    RS       XP               RS                                         XP

So XP = L = RL/QP = 500/3. Reducing this gives

           L = 500 3 , and so L = 3  2  109 500 = 26.5 nH.                        (6.32)

Similarly -XS/RS = 3 and so                                                         (6.33)
                   1/( C) R = 3 or C = 1 = S 3RS 3  2  109 1  50 = 1.06 pF.

Step 2:                                                                             (6.34)
Resonate the 10 pF capacitor using an inductor in parallel:                         (6.35)

                         L -1 =   10  10-12
                                L = 210-11 1 = (2)2 1018  10-11 1 = 2.533 nH.

Thus Figure 6-13(c) is the required matching network. Two inductors are in parallel and the
circuit can be simplified to that shown in Figure 6-14, where

           LX = (26.5 nH  2.533 nH) = 2.533  26.5 nH = 2.312 nH.                   (6.36)

EXAMPLE 6.6 Matching Network Design Using Resonance and Absorption

     For the source and load configurations shown in Figure 6-15, design a lowpass impedance
     matching network at f = 1 GHz.

     Solution:

     Since RS < RL, use the topology shown in Figure 6-16(a). For a lowpass response, the
     topology is that of Figure 6-16(b). Notice that absorption is the natural way of handling the

     3 nH at the source and the 5 pF at the load. The design process is as follows:

     Step 1:

     Design the matching network, neglecting the reactive elements at the source and load:

     |QS| = |QP | =  RL - 1 = 10 - 1 = 3                                                    (6.37)

     This design is shown in Figure 6-17(a). This is the matching network that matches the 100 
     source resistance to the 1000  load with the source and load reactances ignored.

     Step 2:

     Figure 6-17(b) is the interim matching solution. The source inductance is absorbed into the
     matching network, reducing the required series inductance of the matching network. The
     capacitance of the load cannot be fully absorbed. The design for the resistance-only case
     requires a shunt capacitance of 0.477 pF, but 5 pF is available from the load. Thus there is an
     excess capacitance of 4.523 pF that must be resonated out by the inductance L:

        L 1 = 4.523  10-12. So L = (2)2  1018  4.523  10-12 1 = 5.600 nH. (6.40)

     The final matching network design (Figure 6-17(c)) fully absorbs the source inductance into
     the matching network, but only partly absorbs the load capacitance.

6.6 Multielement Matching

The bandwidth of a matching network can be controlled by using multiple
matching stages either making the matching bandwidth wider or narrower.
This concept is elaborated on in this and several design approaches
presented.

6.6.1 Design Concept for Manipulating Bandwidth

The concept for manipulating matching network bandwidth is to do the
matching in stages as shown in Figure 6-18. Figure 6-18(a) shows the one-
stage matching problem using the common identification of the matching
network as `M'. The one-stage matching problem is repeated in Figure 6-
18(b) without explicitly showing the source generator. A two-stage matching
problem is shown in Figure 6-18(c) with the introduction of a virtual resistor
RV between the first, M1, and second, M2, stage matching networks. RV
is shown as a virtual connection as it is not actually inserted in the circuit.
Instead this is a short-hand way of indicating the matching problem to be
done in two stages as shown in Figure 6-18(d and e) with the first stage
matching the source resistor RS to RV and the second stage matching RV

     to the load resistor RL. After M1 has been designed the resistance looking
     into the right-hand port of M1, see Figure 6-18(d), will be RV so RV is the
     Thevenin equivalent source resistance to M2. Similarly the input impedance
     looking into the left-hand port of M2 is RV so RV is the effective load
     resistor of M1. Of course these are the impedances at the center frequency
     and away from the center frequency of the match the input impedances will

     be complex.

     The concept behind multi-stage matching network design is shown in Figure

     6-19 where the standard one-stage match is shown in Figure 6-19(a). While
     this is shown for RL > RS the concept holds for RL < RS. The arrows follow
     the convention that design begins with the load and ends at the source. With
     the one stage match the circuit Q is fixed designated here as the total circuit
     Q, QT being the same as the Q of the one-stage RL to RS matching network,
     QSL. The two-stage match that reduces bandwidth (compared to the one-
     stage match) is shown in Figure 6-19(b). The total Q, QT , of the second stage
     is higher than for the one-stage design because the ratio of RL to RV is
     greater than the ratio of RV to RS. Bandwidth can also be reduced relative to
     the one-stage match by assigning RV to be greater than both RL and RS, see
     Figure 6-19(c).
     Choosing RV to be between RS and RL will result in a circuit with lower
     QT and the bandwidth of the match will increase, see Figure 6-19(d). The
     maximum bandwidth for a two-stage match is to choose RV as the geometric
     mean of RS and RL. This concept can be extended to multiple stages as
     shown for a three-stage match in Figure 6-19(e).

     This section presents various matching network designs for manipulating

     bandwidth and all are based on the concept of choosing a virtual resistor.

     6.6.2 Three-Element Matching Networks

     With the L network (i.e., two-element matching), the circuit Q is fixed once
     the source and load resistances, RS and RL, are fixed:

                             Q = RL - 1, (RL > RS).      (6.41)

Thus the designer does not have a choice of circuit Q. Breaking the matching
problem into parts enables the circuit Q to be controlled. Introducing a third
element in the matching network provides the extra degree of freedom in the
design for adjusting Q, and hence bandwidth.
Two three-element matching networks, the T network and the Pi network,
are shown in Figure 6-20. Which network is used depends on

(a) the realization constraints associated with the specific design, and
(b) the nature of the reactive parts of the source and load impedances and

     whether they can be used as part of the matching network.

The three-element matching network comprises 2 two-element (or L)
matching networks and is used to increase the overall Q and thus narrow
bandwidth. Given RS and RL, the circuit Q established by an L matching
network is the minimum circuit Q available in the three-element matching
arrangement. With three-element matching, the Q can only increase, so three-
element matching is used for narrowband (high-Q) applications. However,
lower Q can be obtained with more than three elements. The next subsections

consider matching with more than three elements.

networks with a virtual resistance, RV , between the networks.

     6.6.3 The Pi Network

     The Pi network may be thought of as two back-to-back L networks that are
     used to match the load and the source to a virtual resistance, RV , placed
     at the junction between the two networks, as shown in Figure 6-21(b). The
     design of each section of the Pi network is as for the L network matching. RS
     is matched to RV and RV is matched to RL.
     RV must be selected smaller than RS and RL since it is connected to the
     series arm of each L section. Furthermore, RV can be any value that is smaller
     than the smaller of RS, RL. However, it is customarily used as the design
     parameter for specifying the desired Q.
     As a useful design approximation, the loaded Q of the Pi network can be
     taken as the Q of the L section with the highest Q:

                                             Q = max(RS, RL) - 1.                                   (6.42)
                                                             RV

     Given RS, RL, and Q, the above equation yields the value of RV .

EXAMPLE 6.7 Three-Element Matching Network Design

     Design a Pi network to match a 50  source to a 500  load. The desired Q is 10. A suitable
     matching network topology is shown in Figure 6-22 together with the virtual resistance, RV ,
     to be used in design.

     Solution: RS = 50  and RL = 500  so max(RS , RL) = 500  and so the virtual resistor is

              RV = Q2 max(RS, RL) + 1 = 500 101 = 4.95 .               (6.43)

     Design proceeds by separately designing the L networks to the left and right of RV . For the
     L network on the left,

     Qleft =  50 - 1 = 3.017. so Qleft = |Xa| = RS = 3.017,            (6.44)
              4.95                           RV |X1|

     Note that X1 and Xa must be of opposite types (one is capacitive and the other is inductive).
     The left L network has elements

              |Xa| = 14.933  and |X1| = 16.6 .                         (6.45)

The resulting Pi network is shown in Figure 6-23 with the values

              |X1| = 16.6 , |X3| = 50 , |Xa| = 14.933 , and |Xb| = 49.5 .       (6.48)

Note that the pair Xa, X1 are of opposite types and similarly Xb, X3 are of opposite types.
So there are four possible realizations, as shown in Figure 6-24.

In the previous example there were four possible realizations of the three-
element matching network, and this is true in general. The specific choice
of one of the four possible realizations will depend on specific application-
related factors such as

                It is fortunate that it may be possible to achieve multiple functions with the
                same network.

EXAMPLE 6.8 Three-Element Matching with Reactive Source and Load

     Design a Pi network to match the source to the load
     shown. The design frequency is 900 MHz and the
     desired Q is 10.

     Solution:

     The design objective is to arrive at an overall network which has a Q of 10. To achieve this
     it is necessary to absorb the source and load reactances into the matching network. If they
     were resonated instead, the overall Q of the network can be expected to higher than the Q of
     the L matching network on its own.

     Design begins by considering the matching
     of RS = 50  to RL = 500 . Since the
     Q is specified, three (or more) matching
     elements must be used. The design starting
     point is shown on the right:

     The virtual resistor RV = max (Rs, RL)/(1 +    Note that QRIGHT is almost exactly the
     Q2) = (500 )/(1 + 100) = 4.95 .                desired Q of the network and QLEFT
                                                    will have little effect on the Q of the
     The left subnetwork with X1 and Xa has         overall circuit. Now QLEFT = |Xa|/RV =
                                                    RS/|X1|, so |Xa| = 14.9  and |X1| =
     QLEFT = RS/RV - 1 = 50/4.95 - 1 =              16.57 . QRIGHT = |Xb|/RV = RS /|X2|,
                                                    so |Xb| = 49.5  and |X2| = 50.0 .
     3.017. The right subnetwork with X2 and

     Xb has QRIGHT =         RL/RV - 1 =

     500/4.95 - 1 = 10.001.

     X1 must be chosen to be a capacitor C1 =
     10.67 pF so that the 2 pF source capacitance
     can be absorbed. Similarly X2 is a capacitor
     C2 = 3.53 pF. Xa and Xb are both inductors
     that combine in series for a total inductance
     L3 = 11.38 nH. This leads to the final design
     shown on the right where the matching
     network is in the dashed box.

                6.6.4 Matching Network Q Revisited

                To demonstrate that the circuit Q established by an L matching network is the
                minimum circuit Q for a network having at most three elements, consider the
                design equations for RS > RL. Referring to Figure 6-25,

Then for a real solution we must have

                    Q  RS - 1,                       (6.51)
                             RL

and so Q  QL network. For Q = QL network, X3   and the Pi network
reduces to an L network that has two elements. Thus it is not possible to
have a lower Q with a three-element matching network than the Q of a two-
element matching network. Thus a three-element matching network must
have lower bandwidth than that of a two-element matching network.

6.6.5 The T Network

The T network may be thought of as two back-to-back L networks that are
used to match the load and the source to a virtual resistance, RV , placed
at the junction between the two L networks (see Figure 6-26). RV must be
selected to be larger than both RS and RL since it is connected to the shunt
leg of each L section. RV is chosen according to the equation

               Q = RV - 1,                           (6.52)
                        min(RS, RL)

where Q is the desired loaded Q of the network. Each L network is calculated

in exactly the same manner as was done for the Pi network matching. That
is, RS is matched to RV and RV is matched to RL. Once again there will be
four possible designs for the T network, given RS , RL, and Q.

6.6.6 Broadband (Low Q) Matching

L network matching does not allow the circuit Q, and hence bandwidth, to be
selected. However, Pi network and T network matching allows the circuit Q
to be selected independent of the source and load impedances, provided that
the chosen Q is larger than that which can be obtained with an L network.
Thus the Pi and T networks result in narrower bandwidth designs.
One design solution for broadband matching is to use two (or more) series-
connected L sections (see Figure 6-27). Design is still based on the concept
of a virtual resistor, RV , placed at the junction of the two L networks (as in
Figure 6-28), but now RV is chosen to be between RS and RL:

                    Rmin  RV  Rmax,                  (6.53)

     where Rmin = min(RL, RS) and Rmax = max(RL, RS). Then one of the two
     networks will have

     Q1 = RV - 1 and the other Q2                                 = Rmax - 1.   (6.54)
                Rmin                                                     RV

     The maximum bandwidth (minimum Q) available is obtained when

                                    Q1 = Q2 =   RV - 1 =   Rmax - 1 .           (6.55)
                                               Rmin         RV

     That is, the maximum matching bandwidth is obtained when RV is the
     geometric mean of RS and RL:

                                               RV = RLRS.                       (6.56)

     Even wider bandwidths can be obtained by cascading more than two L
     networks, as shown in Figure 6-29. In this circuit

                                    RS < RV 1 < RV 2 . . . < RV n-1 < RL.       (6.57)

     For optimum bandwidth the ratios should be equal,

                                    RV1 = RV2 = RV3 =    = RL ,              (6.58)
                                    RS RV1 RV2             RVn-1

     and the Q is given by

          Q=                        RV1 - 1 =  RV2 - 1 =    =   RL - 1.      (6.59)

     If there are N L networks used in the match, the maximum bandwidth will
     be obtained if the ith virtual resistor is

                                    RV i = (RSRL)i/N , i = 1, . . . , (N - 1).  (6.60)

EXAMPLE 6.9 Two-Section Matching Network Design

Consider matching a 10  source to a 1000  load using two L matching networks and
designing for a Q of 3. How many matching sections are required?

Solution:

Here the approximate Qs achieved with a single L matching network and with an optimum
two-section design are compared. For a single L network design

                    Q = RL - 1 = 9.95.                                       (6.61)
                              RS

Now consider an optimum two-section design:

                            RL - 1 =                RL - 1 = 3.              (6.62)
RV = RSRL; Q2 =             RV                      RS

Thus the Q is 3 compared to the Q of an L section of 9.95. If the fractional bandwidth is
inversely proportional to Q, then the bandwidth of the two-section design is 9.95/3 = 3.32
times more than that of the L section.

Now consider how many sections are required to obtain a Q of 2:

(1 + Q2) = RV1 = RV2 = . . . = RL                                            (6.63)
                    RS RV1                   RVn-1                           (6.64)

1 + Q2 n = RL R  n ln 1 + Q2 = ln RL  n = S RS ln (1 + Q2 ln(RL/RS )) .

For Q = 2 and RL/RS = 100, n = 2.86, which rounds to n = 3, and three sections are
required.

6.7 Impedance Matching Using Smith Charts

The lumped-element matching networks presented up to now can also be
developed using Smith charts which provide a fairly intuitive approach to
network design. With experience it will be found that this is the preferred
approach to developing designs, as trade-offs can be captured graphically.
Smith chart-based design will be presented using examples.

6.7.1 Two-Element Matching

The examples here build on the preceding lumped-element matching
network designs now using the Smith chart introduced in Chapter 3.
Capacitive and inductive regions on the Smith chart are shown in Figure
6-30. In the design examples presented here, circles of constant resistance
or constant conductance are followed and these correspond to varying
reactance or susceptance, respectively.

EXAMPLE 6.10 Two-Element Matching Network Design Using a Smith Chart

      Develop a two-element matching network to match a source with an impedance of RS =
     25  to a load RL = 200  (see Figure 6-31).

      Solution:

      The design objective is to present conjugate matched impedances to the source and load.
      However, since here the source and load impedances are real, the design objective is Z1 = RS
     and Z2 = RL. The load and source resistances are plotted on the Smith chart in Figure 6-
     33(a) after choosing a normalization impedance of Z0 = 50  (and so rS = RS/Z0 = 0.5
      and rL = RL/Z0 = 4). The normalized source impedance, rS, is Point A, and the normalized
      load impedance, rL, is Point C. The matching network must be lossless, which means that
      the design must follow lines of constant resistance (on the impedance part of the Smith chart)
      or constant conductance (on the admittance part of the Smith chart). So Points A and C must
      be on the above circles and the circles must intersect if a design is possible. The design can
      be viewed as moving back from the source toward the load or moving back from the load
      toward the source. (The views result in identical designs.) Here the view taken is moving
      back from the source toward the load.

       One possible design is shown in Figure 6-33(a). From Point A, the line of constant resistance
      is followed to Point B (there is increasing series reactance along this path). From Point B,
      the locus follows a line of constant conductance to the final point, Point C. There is also an
     alternative design that follows the path shown in Figure 6-33(b). There are only two designs
      that have a path from A to B following just two arcs. At this point two designs have been
      outlined. The next step is assigning element values.

         The design shown in Figure 6-33(a) begins with rS followed by a series reactance, xS,
      taking the locus from A to B. Then a shunt capacitive susceptance, bP , takes the locus from
      B to C and rL. At Point A the reactance xA = 0, at Point B the reactance xB = 1.323. This
      value is read off the Smith chart, requiring that an arc as shown be interpolated between the
      arcs provided. It should be noted that not all versions of Smith charts include negative signs,
      as the chart becomes too complicated. Thus the user needs to be aware and add signs where
      appropriate. The normalized series reactance is

that is,            xS = xB - xA = 1.323 - 0 = 1.323,                              (6.65)
                    XS = xsZ0 = 1.323  50 = 66.1 .                                (6.66)

A shunt capacitive element takes the locus from Point B to Point C and

          bP = bC - bB = 0 - (-0.661) = 0.661,                                     (6.67)

so        BP = bP /Z0 = 0.661/50 = 13.22 mS or XP = -1/BP = -75.6 .

                                                                                   (6.68)

The final design is shown in Figure 6-32.

One of the advantages of using the Smith chart is that the design progresses
in stages, with the structure of the design developed before actual numerical
values are calculated. Of course, it is difficult to extract accurate values from
a chart, so designs are regularly roughed out on a Smith chart and refined
using CAD tools. Example 6.10 matched a resistive source to a resistive
load. The next example considers the matching of complex load and source
182                                          STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

                      impedances. In the earlier algorithmic approach to matching network design
                      absorption and resonance were introduced as strategies for dealing with
                      complex terminations. Design was not always straightforward. It will be seen
                      that this complication disappears with a Smith chart-based design, as it is
                      conceptually not much different from the resistive problem of Example 6.10.

EXAMPLE 6.11 Matching Network Design With Complex Impedances

     Develop a two-element matching network to match a source with an impedance of ZS =
     12.5 + 12.5  to a load ZL = 50 - 50 , as shown in Figure 6-34.

     Solution:

     The design objective is to present conjugate matched impedances to the source and load;

     that  is, Z1  =       and  Z2  =        The     choice  here is   to  design for Z1; that  is, elements will

                      ZS               ZL .

     be inserted in front of ZL to produce the impedance Z1. The normalized source and load

     impedances are plotted in Figure 6-35(a) using a normalization impedance of Z0 = 50 , so

     zS = ZS /Z0 = 0.25 + 0.25 (Point S) and zL = ZL/Z0 = 1 -  (Point C).

     The   impedance  to   be  synthesized   is  z1  =  Z1 /Z0  =      =   0.25 - 0.25  (Point  A).  The  matching

                                                                   zS

     network must be lossless, which means that the lumped-element design must follow lines of

     constant resistance (on the impedance part of the Smith chart) or constant conductance (on

     the admittance part of the Smith chart). Points A and C must be on the above circles and the

     circles must intersect if a design is possible.

     The design can be viewed as moving back from the load impedance toward the conjugate
     of the source impedance. The direction of the impedance locus is important. One possible
     design is shown in Figure 6-35(a). From Point C the line of constant conductance is followed
     to Point B (there is increasing positive [i.e., capacitive] shunt susceptance along this path).
     From Point B the locus follows a line of constant resistance to the final point, Point A.

     The design shown in Figure 6-35(a) begins with a shunt susceptance, bP , taking the locus
     from Point C to Point B and then a series inductive reactance, xS, taking the locus to Point A.
     At Point C the susceptance bC = 0.5, at Point B the susceptance bB = 1.323. This value is read
     off the Smith chart, requiring that an arc of constant susceptance, as shown, be interpolated
     between the constant susceptance arcs provided. The normalized shunt susceptance is

     that is,       bP = bB - bC = 1.323 - 0.5 = 0.823,                                                   (6.69)
                   BP = bP /Z0 = 0.823/(50 ) = 16.5 mS or XP = -1/BP = -60.8 .                            (6.70)

     A series reactive element takes the locus from Point B to Point A, so

                   xS = xA - xB = -0.25 - (-0.661) = 0.411,                                               (6.71)
                                                                                                          (6.72)
     so            XS = xSZ0 = 0.411  50  = 20.6 .

     The final design is shown in Figure 6-36.

     There are only two designs that have a path from Point C to Point A following just two
     arcs. In Design 1, shown in Figure 6-35(a), Path CBA is much shorter than Path CHA for
     Design 2 shown in Figure 6-35(b). The path length is an approximate indication of the total
     reactance required, and the higher the reactance, the greater the energy storage and hence
     the narrower the bandwidth of the design. (The actual relative bandwidth depends on the
     voltage and current levels in the network; the path length criteria, however, is an important
     rule of thumb.) Thus Design 1 can be expected to have a much higher bandwidth than Design
     2. Since designing broader bandwidth is usually an objective, a design requiring a shorter
     path on a Smith chart is usually preferable.

6.8 Distributed Matching

Matching using lumped elements leads to series and shunt lumped elements.
The shunt elements can be implemented using shunt transmission lines, as
a short length (less than one-quarter wavelength long) of short-circuited
transmission line looks like an inductor and a short section of open-circuited
transmission line looks like a capacitor. However, in most transmission
line technologies it is not possible to realize the series elements as lengths
of transmission lines. While it has been shown that a short length of
transmission line is inductive, replacing series inductors by a length of
transmission line of high characteristic impedance is not the best approach
to realizing networks. The solution is to use lengths of transmission line
together with shunt elements. If space is not at a premium, this is an
optimum solution, as transmission lines have much lower loss than a lumped
inductor. The series transmission lines rotate the reflection coefficient on the
Smith chart.
As with all matching design, using transmission lines begins with a topology
in mind. Several topologies are shown in Figure 6-37. Figure 6-37(a) is the

                         and stub realized as an open-circuited transmission line. Figure 6-37(b) is a
                         shorthand schematic for this circuit. Matching network design then becomes
                         a problem of choosing the lengths and characteristic impedances of the lines.
                         The stub here is used to realize a capacitive shunt element. This network
                         corresponds to two-element matching with a shunt capacitor. The value of
                         the shunt capacitance can be increased using a dual stub, as shown in Figure
                         6-37(c), where the capacitive input impedances of each stub are in parallel.
                         The dual circuit to that in Figure 6-37(a) is shown in Figure 6-37(d) together
                         with its schematic representation in Figure 6-37(e). This circuit has a short-
                         circuited stub that realizes a shunt inductance.
                         Mixing lumped capacitors with a transmission line element, as shown in
                         Figure 6-37(f), realizes a much more space-efficient network design. There
                         are many variations to stub-based matching network design, including the
                         two-stub design in Figure 6-37(g).
                         A common situation encountered in the laboratory is the matching of
                         circuits that are in development. Laboratory items available for matching
                         include the stub tuner, shown in Figure 6-38(a), and the double-stub tuner,
                         shown in Figure 6-38(b). With the double-stub tuner the length of the series
                         transmission line is fixed, but stubs can have variable length using lengths
                         of transmission lines with sliding short circuits. Not all impedances can
                         be matched using a double stub tuner, however. A triple-stub tuner can
                         match all impedances presented to it [2]. The double-slug tuner shown in
                         Figure 6-38(c) has dielectric slugs each of which introduces a short section
                         of lower impedance line. The slugs are moved up and down the line and
                         avoid the rapid changes in impedances that occur with the stub tuners and
                         as a result the double-slug tuner provides a broader bandwidth match than
                         does the double stub tuner.. The slide-screw slug tuner shown in Figure 6-
                         38(d) can achieve a broadband match. Here a metal slug can be lowered into
                         the slabline changing the impedance of a section of transmission line and
                         mostly affects the magnitude of the reflection coefficient while moving the
                         metal slug along the line mostly affects the phase. This is the type of tuner
                         incorporated in computer-controlled automated tuners.

6.8.1 Stub Matching

In this section matching using one series transmission line and one stub will
be considered. This corresponds to the microstrip circuit topologies shown in
Figures 6-37(a and d). First, consider the terminated transmission line shown
in Figure 6-39. When the length, 1, of the line is zero, the input impedance
of the line, Zin, equals ZL. How it changes is best described by considering
the input reflection coefficient, in, of the line. If the reflection coefficient is
normalized to Z01, then the magnitude of in and its phase varies as twice
the electrical length of the line. This situation is shown on the Smith chart in
Figure 6-39, where ZL is chosen arbitrarily. The input reflection coefficient of

                  the line rotates in a clockwise direction as the length of the line increases. One
                  way of remembering this is to consider an open-circuited line. When the line
                  length is zero, Yin = 0 and in = +1. A short length of this line is capacitive
                  so that its reflection coefficient will be in the bottom half of the Smith chart.
                  A length of line can be used to rotate the impedance to an appropriate point
                  to follow a line of constant conductance to the desired input impedance.

EXAMPLE 6.12 Matching Network Design With a Transmission Line and a Single Stub

       Design a two-element matching network to match a source with an impedance ZS =
       12.5 + 12.5  to a load ZL = 50 - 50 , as shown in Figure 6-34. This example repeats the
       design in Example 6.11, but now using a transmission line.

       Solution:

       As  in  Example  6.11,  choose  Z0  =  50    and  the  design  path  is  from  zL  =  ZL /Z0  =  1-    to    

                                                                                                                  zs ,

       where zs = 0.25 + 0.25. One possible design solution is indicated in Figure 6-40. The line

       length,  (taking the locus from Point C to Point B), is

                                        = 0.4261 - 0.3125 = 0.1136,

       and the normalized shunt susceptance, bP (taking the locus from Point B to Point C), is

                                           bP = bA - bB = 2 - 1 = 1.

       Thus XP = (-1/bP )  50  = -50 . The final design is shown in Figure 6-41(a). The stub
       design of Figure 6-41(b) follows the procedure described in Example 6.5.

6.8.2 Hybrid Lumped-Distributed Matching

A lossless matching network can have transmission lines as well as inductors
and capacitors. If the system reference or normalization impedance is the
characteristic impedance of a transmission line, then the locus of the input
impedance (or reflection coefficient) of the line with respect to the length of
the line is an arc on a circle centered at the origin of the Smith chart. The
direction of the arc is clockwise as the electrical length of the line moves
away from the load. So a hybrid matching network is possible that combines
a length of transmission line with a lumped element (preferably a capacitor
rather than an a inductor as the inductor would have a relatively lower Q).

6.9 Matching Options Using the Smith Chart

The purpose of this section is to use the Smith chart to present several design
options for matching a source to a load, see Figure 6-42. The designs here
provide another view of design using the Smith chart.

6.9.1 Locating the Design Points

The first design choice to be made is the reference impedance to use. Here

ZREF = 50  will be chosen largely because this is in the center of the design

space for microstrip lines. Generally the characteristic impedance, Z0, of a

microstrip line needs to be between 20  and 100 . A microstrip line with

Z0 < 20  will be wide and there is a possibility of multimoding due to

transverse resonance. Also 20  line is about six times wider than a 50  line

and so takes up a lot of room and there is a good chance that it could be close

to other microstrip lines or perhaps the wall of an enclosure. This is based on

the rule of thumb (developed in Example 3.4 of [1]) that Z0  h/w where

h is the substrate thickness and w is the strip width. The thickness is usually

fixed, i.e. it is not always a readily changed design choice. If Z0 > 100 

the characteristic impedance is getting close to the wave impedance of free

space and of the dielectric of the substrate. As such it is likely that field lines

are not tightly constrained by the metal of the strip and the fields can more

likely radiate. Then radiation loss can be high or coupling to a neighboring

microstrip can be high.

The normalized source and load impedances are zS = ZS/ZREF = [(29.36 -

12.05) ]/(50 ) = 0.587 - 0.241 and zL = ZL/ZREF = [(132.7 -

148.8) /(50 ) = 2.655 - 2.976 = rL + xL, respectively. Maximum

power transfer requires that the input impedance of the matching network

terminated  in  ZL  be  Z1  =  ZS ,  i.e.  z1  =  z    =  0.587  +  0.241   =  r1  +  x1.  These

                                                    S

impedances are plotted on the normalized Smith chart in Figure 6-43.

The normalized load impedance is Point L. To locate this point the

arcs corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of zL are considered

separately. The resistive part of zL is rL = 2.655 and the resistance labels are

     located on the horizontal axis (or equator) of the Smith chart. There are two
     sets of labels, one for normalized resistance, r (which is above the horizontal
     axis), and one for normalized conductance, g (which is below the horizontal
     axis). The way to remember which is which is to realize that the infinite
     impedance point is at the  = +1 (open circuit) location on the right of the
     graph. At the origin (center) of the Smith chart r = 1 = g and to the right of
     the center the values of r should be greater than one. The closest r labels to
     rL = 2.655 are r = 2.0 and r = 3.0. There are five divisions so the unlabeled
     curves correspond to 2.2, 2.4, . . . . The arc corresponding to r = 2.655 must
     be interpolated and this interpolation is shown as the Path `a'.
     The imaginary part of zL is xL = -2.976. The labels for the arcs of constant
     reactance are given adjacent to the unit circle. There are two sets of labels,
     one for reactance and one for susceptance. To recall which is which, the point
     of infinite impedance can be used and the required reactance labels should
     increase towards the  = +1 point. Recall that the Smith chart does not

include signs of reactances (there is not enough room) so note must be made
that positive reactances are in the top half of the Smith chart and negative
reactances are in the bottom half. Since xL is negative it will be in the bottom
half of the Smith chart. The closest labels are x = 2.0 (this is actually -2.0)
and x = 3.0 (this is actually -3.0) so the arc for x = -2.976 is interpolated as
the Path `b'. Point L, i.e. zL, is located at the intersection of Paths `a' and`b'.
The normalized impedance z1 is located similarly at Point 1 by finding the
point of intersection of the r1 = 0.587 arc, Path `c', and the x1 = +0.241 arc,
Path `d'.

6.9.2 Design Options

By convention design follows a process of beginning with zL and adding
series and shunt elements in front of it evolving the impedance (or reflection
coefficient) until the input impedance is z1 = zS . Three electrical designs are
shown in Figure 6-44 and the corresponding lumped-element and microstrip
topologies are shown in Figure 6-45. The subscript on the circuit elements
correspond to the paths on the Smith chart in Figure 6-44 . The designs will
be elaborated in the following subsections.

6.9.3 Design 1, Hybrid Design

Design 1 on its own is shown in Figure 6-46. The concept here is to use a
transmission line and a shunt to go from the load Point L to the Point 1.
The reason why a shunt element is chosen and not a series element is that
the shunt element can be implemented as stub line and a series element,
i.e. a series stub, cannot be implemented in microstrip. A lumped element
limits a design to the low microwave range as losses become prohibitively
large especially for inductors. Also if a microstrip line is going to be used
anyway then a decision already has been made that there is enough room
to implement a transmission-line based design and so the shunt lumped
element can reasonably be replaced by a stub.
Design follows trial and error. The first attempt, and the one that works here,
is to draw a circle through L centered on the origin at Point O. This circle
describes a transmission line whose characteristic impedance is the same
as the reference impedance of the Smith chart, here 50 . The next step is
to draw a circle of constant conductance through Point 1. The combination
path from L to 1 needs to lie on these circles and the intermediate point
will be where these circles intersect. One other constraint is that with a
transmission line the locus (as the line length increases) of the input reflection
coefficient of the line must rotate in the clockwise direction. It is seen that
there are two points of intersection and the first of these, at A, is chosen in
design. So the electrical design is defined by the directed Paths `g' and `h'.
Path `g' defines the properties of the transmission line and Path 'h' defines
the properties of the shunt element. As `h' is directed towards the infinite
inductive susceptance point, Path `h' defines an inductor. The topology of
this design is shown in Figure 6-45(a).
The characteristic impedance of the transmission line (defined by Path `g')
is Z0g = 50 . The electrical length of the line is defined by the angle
subtended by the arc `g'. The electrical length of the line is determined from
the outermost circular scale which is labeled `WAVELENGTHS TOWARDS

GENERATOR.' A line drawn from O through L intersecting the scale has a
scale reading of L = 0.280. Then the scale reading at A is similarly found as
A = 0.452 and so the line length is g = A -L = 0.452-0.280 = 0.172.
Another way of determining the electrical length of the line is from the
change in reflection coefficient angle. For L the reflection coefficient angle
is L = -21.8 read from the innermost circular scale. This angle is just the
angle from the polar plot. Then the angle at A is read as A = -145.7. The
difference is |A -L| = |-145.7-(-21.8)| = 124.9. The electrical length of
the line is half the change in reflection coefficient angle and so the electrical
length of the line is g = 12 124.9 = 62.5. Now  corresponds to an electrical
length of 360 so g corresponds to 62.5/360 = 0.174 corresponding to the
previously determined length of 0.172 which is very good agreement given
that these were derived from graphical readings.
Path `h' defines a shunt inductor and a circle of constant conductance is
192  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

     followed with only the susceptance changing. The susceptance indicated by
     Path `g' is bg = b1 - bA. To obtain bA extend the circle of constant susceptance
     through A out to the unit circle. The extended circle cross the unit circle
     between the susceptance labels 2.0 and 3.0. A check is that susceptance is
     positive in the bottom half of the Smith chart so the signs of the labels do
     not need to be adjusted. There are two scales adjacent to the unit circle,
     one for normalized susceptance and one for normalized reactance. Since
     the intersection is close to the infinite susceptance point at the s/c (short-
     circuit) so the values that are becoming very large towards s/c are used.
     Interpolation results in the reading bA = 2.48. A similar process applied to
     Point 1 results in b1 = -0.598 where the negative sign has been applied to
     the scale reading since the point of intersection between the arc of constant
     susceptance passing through Point 1 and the unit circle is in the top half of
     the Smith chart. Thus bh = b1 - bA = -0.598 - 2.48 = -3.08 and so the
     normalized reactance of the shunt element is xh = -1/bh = 0.325. The un-
     normalized reactance of the shunt element is Xh = xhZREF = 16.2 .
     The final Design 1 hybrid layout is shown in Figure 6-45(a) with Xh = 16.2 ,
     Z0g = 50 , and g = 0.172. That is all that is needed to define the electrical
     design, providing the electrical length in degrees, g = 62.5 is redundant
     but provided anyway. The transmission line in Figure 6-45(a) is shown as as
     the top view of the strip of a microstrip line as is commonly done. A more
     common way of representing this schematic is shown in Figure 6-45(b) where
     the ground connections at Ports 1 and 2 have been removed and the ground
     connection of the inductor shown separately.

     6.9.4 Design 1 with an Open-Circuited Stub

     In the previous section Design 1 was left as a hybrid design with a
     transmission line and a lumped-element inductor. In this section the lumped-
     element inductor is implemented as an open-circuited stub, see Figure 6-
     45(d). Recall that the 50 -normalized susceptance of the inductor is bh =
     -3.08. If the stub is also implemented as a 50  line then bh can be used
     unchanged. Point C in Figure 6-47 corresponds to the normalized admittance
     0 - 3.08. The unit circle is the zero conductance circle (and is also the zero
     resistance circle) and the susceptance is read from the scale adjacent to the
     unit circle again using as reference that susceptances in the top half of the
     Smith chart need to incorporate a negative sign and the susceptance scale
     is identified by the susceptance values becoming larger approaching the s/c
     point. Point C also corresponds to xh = -1/bh = 3.25 and indeed this is the
     value read from the normalized reactance scale.
     A transmission line needs to be designed to have a normalized input
     susceptance of bh = -3.08. Choosing an open circuit, o/c, termination the
     point corresponding to o/c is as identified in the figure. At the o/c point
     the length scale reads o/c = 0.250. The locus rotates in the clockwise
     direction up to Point C where the direct electrical reading reading is C =
     0.050. Using this directly to determine the line length k = C - o/c =
     0.050 - 0.250 = -0.20 which indicates that the stub has a negative
     length. Clearly an erroneous result. This apparent discrepancy comes about
     because the length scale resets at the short circuit point where the length scale
     abruptly goes from 0.5 to 0. Thus the corrected C reading needs to have
     an additional 0.5. Thus the corrected value of C = (0.5 + 0.050) = 0.550
IMPEDANCE MATCHING  193

and k = C - o/c = 0.550 - 0.250 = 0.300.
Thus the final design is as shown in Figure 6-45(d) with Z0k = 50 , and
g = 0.300, Z0g = 50 , and g = 0.172.
The stub could also have been implemented as a short-circuit stub as shown
in Figure 6-45(c). Now the beginning of the line would be at the s/c point
and the line length would be 0.050

6.9.5 Design 2, Lumped-Element Design

Design 2 is a lumped-element design and the Smith-chart-based electrical
design is shown in Figure 6-48 resulting in the schematic shown in Figure 6-
45(e). Design proceeds by identifying where circles of constant conductance
and constant resistance passing through the Points L and 1 intersect. One
solution is shown in Figure 6-48. A circle of constant conductance passes
through L and part of a circle of constant resistance passes through 1. If
the circle had continued there would have been a second intersection with
194  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

                            Figure 6-48: Design 2.

     the circle through L. Both of these intersections mean that there is a shunt
     element adjacent to the load and series element adjacent to the source. Recall
     that in a lumped-element design that under no circumstances can the locus of
     a lumped element pass through the short circuit point (if it is a susceptance)
     or open-circuit point (if it is a reactance), the susceptance and reactance
     infinity points respectively.
     Returning to the actual design shown in Figure 6-48. The first intersection
     of the two circles is Point B so that the design is specified by the Paths `e'
     and 'f'. Design has largely been completed by identifying these paths and
     the next stage is determining the circuit elements that correspond to these
     paths. Path `e' follows a circle of constant conductance and so indicates a
     shunt susceptance and the direction of the locus indicates a capacitance. The
     value of this normalized susceptance is be = bB - bL = 0.506 - 0.187 = 0.319.
     (Remember to check the signs of the readings since the Smith chart omits
     signs of the reactances and susceptances.) Path `f' identifies a series inductor

with a reactance xf = x1 - xB = 0.241 - (-1.78) = 2.02. The final design
is shown in Figure 6-45(e) with Xe = Z0/be = 50/0.319  = 158  and
Xf = Z0xf = 50  2.02  = 101 .

6.9.6 Design 3, Single Line Matching

Design 3 uses a single transmission line to match the source and load as
shown in the schematic of Figure 6-45(f). This design is akin to using a
quarter-wave transmission line transformer but with a Smith chart being
used the approach can now be used with complex source and load
impedances. Recall from Sections 3.5.2 and 4.5 that the locus of a terminated
transmission line is a circle on the Smith chart even if the characteristic
impedance of the transmission line, Z0i in Design 3, and the reference
impedance, ZREF, are not the same. Furthermore the center of the circle will
be on the horizontal axis. The Smith-chart-based electrical design of Design 3
is shown in Figure 6-49 where ZREF = 50 . There is only one way to draw a
circle that passes through two points with the center of the circle constrained
to be on the horizontal axis. That circle is shown in Figure 6-49 with Path `i'
on the circle going from Points L to 1 tracing out the locus of the reflection
coefficient. This locus must be in the clockwise direction. The center of the
circle is at Point D and the center of the circle is (the reflection coefficient
normalized to ZREF) is CD = 0.240. (The radius is also given but this is not
necessary.) The angle subtended by Path `i' is twice the electrical length of
the line. This angle cannot be directly measured from the scales (although
it is possible by placing a chart over the top and and aligning the center of
the polar plot with D) and here was read using a protractor. The angle is
D = 150 so that the electrical length of the line is i = 12 150 = 75, i.e.
i = 74/360 = 0.208. The only parameter not known is the characteristic
impedance, Z0i, of the line. This must be arrived at iteratively. From Equation
(4.40) (after replacing Z01, Z02 and CZ02 by Z0i, ZREF and CD, respectively)

Z0i  ZREF(1 + CD)/(1 - CD)         (6.73)

with the approximation improving the closer Z0i is to ZREF. Substituting
ZREF = 50  and CD = 0.240, the first iteration of Z0i is

1Z0i = 50 1 + 0.240        = 82 .  (6.74)
               1 - 0.240

Re-plotting using a new reference impedance of ZREF = 82  yields a new
center of 0.07 from which an updated iterate is 2Z0i = 94  and then a new
center of 0.02 and 3Z0i = 98 . Continuing to iterate results in an asymptotic
value Z0i = 100 . Z0i can also be estimated from the tabulated values
in Table 4-1. Reading the line with radius of 0.5 and center of 0.24 yields
Z0i = 50  1.980 = 99 .
The final design is as shown in Figure 6-45(f) with i = 0.208, i = 75, and
Z0i = 100 .
As was seen with the quarter-wave transformer design using multiple stages

significantly increases bandwidth by matching to intermediate resistances

determined as geometric means of the source and load resistance. The
corresponding strategy here is to draw a line between the Points 1 and L and,

if there are to be two stages, choose the intermediate matching impedance

     at the mid-point of the line. If the source and loads are complex then the
     reactive storage elements in the source and load will set a limit on maximum
     achievable bandwidth.

     6.9.7 Summary

     This section presented three quite different designs for a matching network.
     One of the particular benefits of using the Smith chart is identifying
     topologies and initial design values. Design can then transfer to a microwave
     circuit simulator. The Smith chart enables back-of-the-envelope design
     studies. While with experience it is possible to complete many of these steps
     with a computer-based Smith chart tool, even experienced designers doodle
     with a printed Smith chart when exploring design options.

6.10 Summary

This chapter presented techniques for impedance matching that achieve
maximum power transfer from a source to a load. The simplest matching
network uses a series and a shunt element, a two-element matching network,
to realize a single-frequency match. This type of impedance matching
network uses lumped elements and can be used up to a few gigahertz.
Performance is limited by the self-resonant frequency of lumped elements
and by their loss, particularly that of inductors. The shunt element can
be replaced by a shunt stub, but in most transmission line technologies,
including microstrip, the series element cannot be implemented as a stub.
Matching networks can also be realized using transmission line segments
only, principally shunt stubs and cascaded transmission lines. A tunable
double-stub matching network, which uses two stubs separated by a
transmission line, is standard equipment in microwave laboratories and
facilitates matching of a circuit under development.
The bandwidth of a matching network is set by the maximum allowable
reflection coefficient of the terminated network. Two-element matching
nearly always results in a narrow match and for typical communications
applications often achieves acceptable matching over bandwidths of only
1%-3%. The most significant determinant of the quality of the match that
can be achieved is the ratio of the source and load resistances, as well as the
reactive energy storage of the source and load. Clearly if the load and source
are resistances of the same value, the bandwidth of the matching network is
infinite, as it is no more than a wired connection.
An important concept in matching network design is a technique for
controlling bandwidth. The concept is based on matching to an intermediate
resistance Rv. Increased bandwidth is obtained if Rv is the geometric mean
of the source and load resistances. This new network consists of two two-
element matching networks. If Rv is greater or less than both the source and
load resistances, then the bandwidth of the matching network is reduced.
Matching network synthesis can also be addressed using filter design
techniques, enabling simultaneous control over the quality and bandwidth
of the match. It is always a good idea to have no more bandwidth in the
system than is needed, as this minimizes the propagation of noise.
A powerful graphical matching tool is the Smith chart on which the load
and source can be plotted. The design objective is then to determine the
path, subject to constraints, from the load back to an input, which is the
complex conjugate of the source, a task that a human is particularly adept
at performing. Alternatively the perspective could be flipped and the role of
the source and load interchanged.
Design becomes increasingly more difficult as the required bandwidth
increases. Many times it is sufficient to have small-to-moderate bandwidths
that can be tuned rather than providing one large instantaneous bandwidth.
Also many of the evolving wireless systems require multiple functionality,
which in turn requires adjustability of a matching network. In some
applications the matching network may require adjustment to match a
variable load impedance. A good example is dealing with a cell phone
antenna where the user may put his or her hand over the antenna and alter
the load seen by the RF frontend. Some types of matching network designs
are more adjustable than others. Such designs require variable components,
so matching design can be a source of competitive advantage.

7.1 Introduction

This chapter presents techniques for developing broadband matching
networks. Sometimes these are akin to cascaded two-port matching
networks. The general concept that works most of the time is to gradually
step from an initial impedance to a final impedance. Design of broadband
matching networks should also be done with the understanding that many
RF systems will have multiple matching networks and so the maximum
passband transmission loss of an individual matching network needs to
be a fraction of a decibel so that when multiple networks are cascaded
the insertion loss at the overall band edges will accumulate to equal the
desired limit on loss. It is common to use a 1 dB insertion loss threshold to
define bandwidth so the individual matching networks may need to have a
bandwidth defined by a loss that is much less with insertion loss thresholds
as low as 0.1 dB often used.
Bandwidth is limited by energy storage and Section 7.2 introduces the Fano-
Bode limits which are theoretical limits of what can be achieved in matching
given reactive loads. It is not possible to exceed the Fano-Bode limits on
bandwidth. Section 7.3 introduces the constant Q circles plotted on Smith
charts to provide a visual guide for the design of broadband matching
networks. The next three sections describe three types of broadband
matching networks. The first, in Section 7.4, describes the stepped-
impedance transmission line transformer which is a generalization of the
quarter-wave transformer. Section 7.5 describes tapered transmission-line

     transformers which are generalizations of stepped impedance broadband
     matching networks. An approach to broadband matching to reactive loads
     is described in Section 7.7.

     7.2 Fano-Bode Limits

     A complex load having energy storage elements limits the bandwidth of the
     match achieved by a matching network. Theoretical limits addressing the
     bandwidth and the quality of the match were developed by Fano [1, 2] based
     on earlier work by Bode [3]. These theoretical limits are known as the Fano-
     Bode criteria or the Fano-Bode limits. The limits for simple loads are shown
     in Figure 7-1. More general loads are treated by Fano [1]. The Fano-Bode
     criteria are used to justify the broad assertion that the more reactive energy
     stored in a load, the narrower the bandwidth of a match.
     The Fano-Bode criteria include the term 1/ |()|, which is the inverse of the
     magnitude of the reflection coefficient looking into the matching network, as
     shown in Figure 7-1. A matching network provides matching over a radian
     bandwidth BW, and outside the matching frequency band the magnitude
     of the reflection coefficient approaches 1. Introducing avg as the average
     absolute value of () within the passband, and with f0 = 0/(2) as the
     center frequency of the match (see Figure 7-2), then the four Fano-Bode
     criteria shown in Figure 7-1 can be written as

     Parallel RC load:                                          Parallel RL load:

     BW ln 1                        (7.1)                       BW ln 1  (0L)         (7.2)

     0     avg             R(0 C )                              0  avg             R

     Series RL load:                                            Series RC load:

     BW ln 1  R                     (7.3)                       BW ln 1  R(0C).       (7.4)

     0     avg             (0L)                                 0  avg

In terms of reactance and susceptance these can be written as

Parallel load:                    Series load:

BW ln    1       G         (7.5)  BW ln 1  R ,                 (7.6)
 0     avg         |B|
                                  0     avg     |X |

where G = 1/R is the conductance of the load, B is the load susceptance, and
X is the load reactance. BW/0 is the fractional bandwidth of the matching
network. Equations (7.5) and (7.6) indicate that the greater the proportion
of energy stored reactively in the load compared to the power dissipated in
the load, the smaller the fractional bandwidth (BW/0) for the same average
in-band reflection coefficient avg.
Equations (7.5) and (7.6) can be simplified one step further:

                        BW ln 1   ,                            (7.7)
                        0  avg       Q

where Q is that of the load. Several general results can be drawn from
Equation (7.7) as follows:

   1. If the load stores any reactive energy, so that the Q of the load is
       nonzero, the in-band reflection coefficient looking into the matching
       network cannot be zero across the passband.

   2. The higher the Q of the load, the narrower the bandwidth of the match
       for the same average in-band reflection coefficient.

   3. The higher the Q of the load, the more difficult it will be to design the
       matching network to achieve a specified matching bandwidth.

   4. A match over all frequencies is only possible if the Q of the load is
       zero; that is, if the load is resistive. In this case a resistive load could be
       matched to a resistive source by using a magnetic transformer. Using
       a matching network with lumped L and C components will result in a
       match over a finite bandwidth. However, with more than two L and C
       elements the bandwidth of the match can be increased.

   5. Multielement matching networks are required to maximize the
       matching network bandwidth and minimize the in-band reflection
       coefficient. The matching network design becomes more difficult as the
       Q of the load increases.

7.3 Constant Q Circles

One strategy for wideband matching is based on the concept of matching
to an intermediate resistance that is the geometric mean of the source and
load impedances. This concept was introduced in Section 6.6 and can be
generalized to intermediate impedances and can be represented on a Smith
chart using constant Q as shown in Figure 7-3. If the load and source
impedances, RL and RS, are resistive, then the normalizing resistance (Rv)
of the Smith chart should (although it is not necessary) be chosen as the
geometric mean of the source and load resistance (i.e., Rv = RLRS). To
maintain a specific circuit Q, and hence bandwidth, the locus of impedances
in the design must stay within or touch, the corresponding constant Q circle.

EXAMPLE 7.1 Broadband Matching Using Constant Q Circles

     Design a broadband matching network at 1 GHz for the situation shown in Figure 7-4.

     Solution:

     ZS = 100 - 94.25 , YL = 0.02 + 0.01 S, and ZL = 40.0 - 20.0 . Normalizing these

     to 100  results in zS = 1 - 0.9425, yL = 2 + 1, and zL = 0.400 - 0.200. Also the Q of

     the source, QS = 0.9425 and the Q of the load is QL = 0.500. The matching design puts a

     network  in  front  of  zL  to  present  an  impedance      to  the  source.  These  values  are  plotted

                                                             zS

     in Figure 7-5. The design objective is to maintain maximum bandwidth and this is done by

     staying inside the Q = 0.9425 circle, where the Q is the larger of the source and load Qs.

     Design can proceed by moving back from the load toward the source, or from the source to

     the load. Most commonly the perspective used is moving back from the load. Then the load

     zL  is  transformed  to         Maximum  bandwidth      is  approximately     achieved  if  the  matching

                              zS .

     stages do not exceed the maximum Q of the load or of the source. So the Q of the stages

     cannot exceed 0.9425. An appropriate matching concept is shown in Figure 7-6. The locus is

     BCDEFGA. The matching network is therefore of the form shown in Figure 7-

     7. The rest of the design is extraction of numerical values, but the difficult part of the design

     has been done.

7.4 Stepped-Impedance Transmission Line Transformer

The wideband matching techniques described in this section use multiple
quarter-wavelength-long transmission line sections with the lines having
characteristic impedances which are stepped from the source impedance to
the load impedance. They are conceptual extensions of the quarter-wave
transformer and differ by how the characteristic impedances of the sections
are chosen. The methods strictly are applicable to resistive source and load
impedances yet achieve reasonably wideband matches with moderately
reactive source and load impedances.

7.4.1 Quarter-Wave Transformer using Geometric Means

Design here uses multiple quarter-wave long transmission lines the
characteristic impedances of which are chosen as geometric means of the
source and load impedances. The procedure is described in the next example.

EXAMPLE 7.2 Multisection Quarter-Wave Transmission Line Transformer

     Design one-, two, and three-section quarter-wave transformers in microstrip to connect a
     power amplifier with an output impedance of 10  to a 50  cable.

     Solution:
     The parameters are ZS = 10  and ZL =50 . The characteristic impedance of a single,
     N = 1, quarter-wave transformer is Z01 = ZS ZL = 22.36 .
     With a two-section, N = 2, quarter-wave transformer (using geometric means)

       Z01 = 3 ZS2 ZL = 17.10  Z02 = 3 ZS ZL2 = 29.24 .

     With a three-section, N = 3, quarter-wave stepped-impedance transformer

                                                       
     Z01 = ZSZ02 = 14.95  Z02 = ZSZL = 22.36  Z03 = Z02ZL = 33.44 . (7.8)

     The microstrip layouts are shown in Figure 7-8 where each section is a quarter-wavelength
     long at mid band. The simulated transmission characteristics of the design realized at 10 GHz
     (on alumina, r = 10, and attenuation of 1.87 dB/m are shown in Figure 7-8(d and e).

       7.4.2 Design Based on the Theory of Small Reflections

       Another design method for choosing the characteristic impedances of
       cascaded lines is based on the theory of small reflections [4, 5]. The reflection
       coefficients at each boundary in Figure 7-9 are defined as

       0 = Z01 - ZS                  n = Zn+1 - Zn       N = ZL - Z0N .                             (7.9)

                                                       sion line transformer with the nth section
                                                       having characteristic impedance Z0n and
                                                       electrical length n. n is the reflection coef-
                                                       ficient, and Zn the impedance, considering
                                                       only the (n + 1)th line.

As these are small reflections (since Z0n changes gradually) the theory of
small reflections (described in Section 2.6.5 of [6]) can be invoked and so,
using Equation ((2.201) of [6]), the total reflection coefficient seen from the
source ZS is

in  0 + e-21 1 + e-22 2 +    e-2N N .                       (7.10)

It is now necessary to make a design choice. It has been found that a
multisection transformer that provides a good broadband match at both the
source and load has symmetrical reflection coefficients, i.e. n = N-n [5].
Another design choice is that the electrical lengths of the sections are the
same, i.e. n = . Then Equation (7.10) becomes

in = 0 + 1e-21 + 2e-42 +    N e-2NN                         (7.11)

= 0 1 + e-2N + 1 e-2 + e-2(N-1) + . . .

= e-N 0 eN + e-N + 1 e(N-2) + e-(N-2) + . . .

= 2e-N {0 cos(N ) + 1 cos[(N - 2)] + . . . }                   (7.12)

using the trigonometric identity cos x = 12 (ex + e-x) (and this is where
symmetry is used). The last term in Equation (7.12) is 21 N/2 if N is even
and (N-1)/2 cos  if N is odd.The design variables here are the reflection
coefficients at each line boundary (from which the characteristic impedances
of the lines can be found) and the mid-band electrical length 0.
The general design approach is to assume a functional form for in() and
then to derive the ns that result in that functional form. in() will now be
used to indicate that in is a function of  and hence of frequency. Also the
mid-band electrical length 0 is set to /2 corresponding to the sections being
a quarter-wavelength long. This may seem arbitrary but it has been shown to

be optimum [7] (for maximum bandwidth). The final design step is to derive

the characteristic impedances of the line sections. Using Equation (7.9)

Z0N = ZL  1 - N     and Z0n = Z0(n+1) 1 - n .                  (7.13)
          1 + N                                  1 + n

7.4.3 Maximally Flat Stepped Impedance Transformer

The design objective here is to set the first N derivatives of in at midband
to zero. This results in a very smooth response and that is what is desired in
some situations. If the following assignment is made

                    |in()|  | cos()|N                          (7.14)

then dn|in()|/dn = 0 at  = /2 = 0 for n = 0, 1, . . . , (N - 1). An
assignment that results in this is the binomial expansion

                                                    N  N e-2n  (7.15)

                                         n (N - n)!n!

              is the binomial coefficient. Equating Equations (7.11) and (7.15)

                                         n = A N .                                                   (7.17)
                                                     n

              To find A consider zero frequency. Then  = 0 and the transformer has no
              effect and in is just the mismatch of the source and load impedances and
              Equation (7.15) becomes

                         in(0) = A2N = ZL - ZS so that A = 2-N ZL - ZS .                             (7.18)

              Thus n() = 2-N ZL - ZS N
                                            ZL + ZS n

              and Z0n comes from Equation (7.13) with the design accuracy determined
              by the approximation of a small discontinuity at each transmission line
              boundary.
              The reflection in and transmission T characteristics of maximally flat
              stepped-impedance transformers are shown in Figure 7-10 for various
              orders. As with all lossless two-ports |T | = 1 - |in|2. It can be seen
              that the bandwidth increases with increasing order and the transmission is
              remarkably flat.

EXAMPLE 7.3 Maximally Flat Multisection Transmission Line Transformer

     Design a three-section maximally flat stepped-impedance transformer in microstrip to
     connect a ZS = 5  source to a ZL = 50  load.

     Solution:

     The design will have three transmission lines of different characteristic impedance and each
     section will be a quarter-wavelength long at mid band. Now N = 3 so from Equation (7.19)

     n = 2-N  ZL - ZS    N = 2-3 50 - 5  3 = 45 3 .                                          (7.20)

     resulting in (a sanity check is the expectation that ZL > Z03 > Z02 . . . )

where       is  ideally      (the  complex     conjugate     of)  the  original  ZS   but   is  actually  significantly

       ZS

different. This is because the design is based on the theory of small reflections and so

multiple reflections at the transmission line boundaries were not considered. As a further

investigation, and noting that each section is a quarter-wavelength long at midband, another

estimate  for   ZS  ,  call  this       ,  is  found  using  Equation  ((2.132))  of  [6],

                                   ZS

                2                                         2                                 2
       Z2 = Z03/ZL = 33.16 , Z1 = Z02/Z2 = 14.07 , ZS = Z01/Z1 = 9.334 .

The microstrip layout is shown in Figure 7-11(a). Simulation of the design realized at 10 GHz
(on alumina, r = 10, a 2.83 mm section length, and a line attenuation of 1.87 dB/m for
an overall attenuation of 0.016 dB) results in the transmission characteristics identified by
z = ZL/ZS = 10 in Figure 7-11(b). The final design does not have the ideal maximally flat
transmission characteristics and this is due to deficiencies in the small reflection assumption.
Final design requires a small amount of optimization as the synthesized design has a
maximum in-band insertion loss of 0.4 dB (T = 0.953).

Repeating the design with ZS = 10  and ZL = 50  results in 0 = 3 = 0.08333,

1  =  2   =  0.2500,   Z01   =     15.23       ,  Z02  =  25.38   ,  Z03  =  42.31   ,  and          =       =  12.89  .

                                                                                                ZS      ZS

The transmission characteristics are identified by z = ZL/ZS = 5 in Figure 7-11(b). The

minimum in-band transmission coefficient is 0.990 for a maximum insertion loss of 0.091 dB.

Thus design accuracy improves for a lower impedance transformation ratio.

7.4.4 Stepped Impedance Transformer With Chebyshev
         Response

Expressing the input reflection coefficient in of a stepped-impedance
transformer in terms of a Chebyshev polynomial results in a good match
in-band that rapidly transitions outside the passband. Compared to the
maximally flat transformer a much better match can be obtained for the
same number of line sections if the resulting ripples in the passband can be
tolerated. With reference to Equation (7.10), the design choice is

       in() = 0 + e-2 1 + e-2 2 +    e-2N                                                    (7.21)
               = Ae-NTN (cos / cos m).

     where TN is the N th order Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind (as de-
     scribed in Section 1.A.10 of [6]). In Equation (7.21) m defines the passband
     of the transformer as being between m    ( - m) and in the passband
     |in()|  m and at  = m and  = ( - m) (the edges of the passband)

     |in(m)| = |in( - m)| = m = |ATN (cos m/ cos m)| = |ATN (1)|. (7.22)

     Since |TN (1)| = 1       A = m                                                        (7.23)

     To proceed another expression is needed for A so that m, N , and m
     (and thus bandwidth) can be related. This is obtained by considering the
     mismatch at zero frequency, that is when  = 0:

                              in(0) = ZL - ZS = ATN (sec m).                               (7.24)
                                           ZL + ZS

     (where sec m = 1/ cos m) and so

                              A = ZL - ZS                       1.                         (7.25)
                              ZL + ZS TN (sec m)

     Substituting for A in Equation (7.21) and using Equation (7.10) results in

     eNin() = ATN (cos / cos m) =                               ZL - ZS  TN (cos / cos m)
                                                                ZL + ZS      TN (sec m)

                              = 2 {0 cos(N ) + 1 cos[(N - 2)] + . . . } .                  (7.26)

     The expansion of TN (cos / cos m) is given in Equation ((1.198)) of [6] and
     has terms in cos(m) and so design (which requires n) proceeds by equating
     terms in Equation (7.26) having the same cos(m) for m = 1, . . . , N . This will

     be illustrated in an example.
     The reflection in and transmission T characteristics of Chebyshev stepped-
     impedance transformers are shown in Figure 7-12 for orders from one to four
     for m = /4 (this indicates a 100% bandwidth). It is seen that the maximum
     inband in) reduces with increasing order. So with a Chebyshev response
     there is a trade-off between passband ripple and bandwidth.
     An expression for bandwidth of the match will now be developed. Equating

     Equations (7.23) and (7.25)

                              TN (sec m) = 1 ZL - ZS                                       (7.27)

     Using the identity

     TN (sec m) = cosh N cosh-1(sec m) = 1 ZL - ZS                                         (7.28)

                            N             m ZL + ZS

The fractional bandwidth can be obtained by noting that  and thus m
are proportional to frequency f . That is, f = k. At the passband center
frequency f0,  = /2 and so k = 2f0/. Thus if fm is the frequency at the
lower band edge, fm = km = 2f0m/. Then the fractional bandwidth (with
the passband defined by when |in|  m) is

              f = 2(f0 - fm) = 2 - 4m .                                             (7.30)
                     f0            f0                   

Thus Equations (7.29) and (7.30) relate the fractional bandwidth, the
maximum passband reflection coefficient m, the impedance mismatch z =
max(ZL/ZS, ZS/ZL), and the Chebyshev order, N . Table 7-1 enables the
required transformer order to be selected for a specified bandwidth and
impedance mismatch.

EXAMPLE 7.4 Chebyshev Multisection Transmission Line Transformer

Design a 100% bandwidth three-section Chebyshev stepped-impedance transformer in
microstrip to connect a power amplifier with an output impedance of 10  to a 50  cable.

Solution:

The design parameters are N = 3, ZS = 10 , and ZL = 50 . From Equation (7.30)
the fractional bandwidth f /f0 = 1 = 2 -(4m)/ so that m = /4. Then, with
sec m = 1/ cos m = 1/ cos(/4) = 2 and T3( 2) = 7.071 (from Equation ((1.193) of [6])),
Equation (7.25) yields

     Using Equation (7.26) and the Chebyshev expansion for T3 this leads to

     AT3(cos / cos m) = A sec3 m[cos(3) + 3 cos ] - 3 sec m cos              (7.32)
                              = 2 [0 cos(3) + 1 cos()] .

     Thus after equating like terms in cos(m) (noting that n = (N-n) since symmetry is
     required)

     0 = 3 = 21 A sec3 m = 21 0.09428  2 3 = 0.1333  3     = 0.2000         (7.33)

     Then the characteristic impedances of the three line sections are (using Equation (7.13))

     Z01 = 13.19 , Z02 = 21.78 , and Z03 = 35.94                             (7.34)

     and each section is a quarter-wavelength long at midband. The microstrip layout is shown in
     Figure 7-13(a). The simulated transmission characteristics of the design realized at 10 GHz
     (on alumina, r = 10, section lengths of 2.83 mm, and an attenuation of 1.87 dB/m (for an
     overall attenuation of 0.016 dB) are shown in Figure 7-13(b). The expected lossless ripple
     (from T = 1 - 2m = 0.9955 = -0.039 dB) is 0.039 dB. The simulated minimum insertion
     loss is 0.024 dB and the maximum in-band insertion loss is 0.057 dB for a passband ripple of

     0.033 dB (line loss is known to reduce ripple).

     7.4.5 Stepped Impedance Transformer Design

     The multisection stepped-impedance transformers change the characteristic
     impedances of the section between the source and load resistances but do
     so in steps. It is possible to achieve a similar result by continuously tapering
     the characteristic impedance of the transmission line taper or, equivalently,
     tapering the width of microstrip line as shown in Figure 7-14.

     7.4.6 Summary

     The multisection impedance transformer design described in this section is
     based on transmission line sections each a quarter-wavelength long at the
     center frequency of the match. It is tempting to think that a better result
     could be obtained by having sections of various lengths. However it has been
     shown that optimum matching transformer designs are of the quarter-wave

Chebyshev type and only minimum enhancement is possible [7].

7.5 Tapered Matching Transformers

Tapered impedance transformers match an impedance ZS to an impedance
ZL using a transmission line having a characteristic impedance Z0 that
gradually and monotonically varies from ZS to ZL along the length of the
line, see Figure 7-14. This figure references a microstrip line but the key
aspect is the gradual change in characteristic impedance that applies to any
transmission line. The central design problem is how to choose the function
Z0(z). If the length of the line,  here, is not constrained then the Klopfentein
taper [8, 9] is regarded as the optimum approach for design of the taper and
will be discussed after first reviewing approaches used when the length of
the line is constrained. Note that both ZL and ZS are resistive.

7.5.1 Small Reflection Theory and Tapered Lines

In this section the theory behind the synthesis of a taper is developed
beginning with the theory of small reflections. The reflection at point z on
the line for a taper segment of length z is (refer to Figure 7-14(a))

 = (Z0(z) + Z) - Z0(z) = Z  Z ,                               (7.35)
          (Z0 + Z) + Z0(z) 2Z0(z) + Z 2Z0(z)

where Z0(z) is the characteristic impedance of the taper at z and Z is the
change of Z0(z) from one side of the taper segment to the other. In the limit
as Z  0, Z is replaced by dZ and  is replaced by d so that Equation

(7.35) becomes (and putting in differential operator form)

d = dZ0  d = d = 1 dZ0 .                                      (7.36)
2Z0(z)                dz dz 2Z0(z) dz

The next step is to refer all of the small reflections, , to the beginning of
the taper at z = -/2. The theory of small reflections is that these small
reflections, accounting for the electrical lengths from the start of the taper to
each taper segment, can be summed, see Equation (7.10). This is the same as
saying that the small reflection from one taper segment is not affected by its
own reflection from another taper segment. Noting that the electrical length
218      STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

     from the beginning of the taper to a taper segment at z is  = (/2 + z), the
     reflection at the input of the tapered line is found as

         in() =      z=/2                                        (7.37)
                                                                 (7.38)
                             e-2(/2+z)d

                    z=-/2

         = 1 e- /2 e-2z dZ0(z) dz,2
                    -/2 Z0(z) dz

     where in is shown explicitly as a function of the length of the taper. So
     the design problem becomes choosing the characteristic impedance function,
     Z0(z) to provide the desired input reflection coefficient in. This is difficult
     to achieve with the form of Equation (7.38). The problem can be simplified
     by noting that (and introducing Z1 as a normalizing impedance so that the
     argument of ln is dimensionless)

     ln (Z0(z)/Z1) = Z1 d(Z0(z)/Z1) = Z1 1 d(Z0(z)/Z1)
     dz  Z0(z) dz           Z0(z) Z1                         dz

         = 1 d(Z0(z)/Z1) ,                                       (7.39)
            Z0(z) dz

     and so, making it clear that d varies along the taper,

         d(z) = 21 d(Z0(z)/Z1) dz dz.                            (7.40)

     Thus after assuming the form of Z0(z), the incremental reflection coefficient
     d is obtained using Equation (7.37). Alternatively (after integrating
     Equation (7.40)) a form for in can be assumed and d(z) determined
     and then Z0(z). This will become clearer below when specific tapers are
     considered.

     7.5.2 Linear taper

     In the linear tapered line design Z0(z) varies linearly from the source
     impedance ZS to ZL:

         Z0(z) = ZS + (ZL - ZS)z/.                               (7.41)

     This is often approximated in microstrip by a linear taper of the width of the
     microstrip line as shown in Figure 7-14(b). A simple expression for the input
     reflection coefficient is not available and so must be found from simulation.
     This is the simplest taper and the taper performs better the greater its
     electrical length (i.e. at higher frequencies or longer physical length). The
     performance of the linear taper is compared to other tapers later.

     7.5.3 Exponential taper

     The exponential taper has an exponential taper of the line's characteristic
     impedance. Setting

     Z0(z) = Zxeaz with a = 1 ln (ZL/ZS) and Zx = ZSe-a/2        (7.42)
                                          
IMPEDANCE MATCHING                                                                        219

results in the input reflection coefficient, derived using Equation (7.38),

in() = 12 Zxe-             - /2 2z d ln(eaz) 1                          sin()
                                  e                  dz = 2 ln (ZL/ZS)         .  (7.43)
                                        dz                              
                           -/2

So in has a sinc function characteristic with the variations of in reducing
as the taper becomes longer. The main problem with this taper comes from
the abrupt impedance discontinuity at the ZL end of the taper. This taper
will not be considered further as the Klopfenstein taper considered next has
much better performance.

7.5.4 Klopfenstein taper

The Klopfenstein taper [8, 9] results in a specified reflection coefficient
ripple (and thus transmission ripple) above a minimum passband frequency.
It is believed to achieve the minimum taper length over a passband
defined by the maximum allowable reflection coefficient mismatch, m,
(and so minimum transmission loss) in the passband. The linear taper
and most other tapers used in matching [10, 11] assume the form of
a taper's characteristic impedance profile and the broadband reflection
and transmission characteristics are whatever results. In contrast the
Klopfenstein taper derives the required impedance profile for a source and
load impedance mismatch ratio (ZL/ZS) and m.
Klopfenstein [8] showed that the input reflection coefficient of the taper
could be expressed as the limiting form of a high-order Chebyshev
polynomial. Thus the Klopfenstein taper has the passband ripples that
occur with Chebyshev-based multi-section impedance transformers and
Chebyshev filters. The maximum magnitude of the reflection coefficient in
the passband is determined by the line length. The appropriate characteristic
impedance is computed from [8, 9]

         ln Z0(z) = ln ZSZL + ln ZL/ZS  (cosh A)-1                               (7.44)
                        A2 (2z/, A) + U z - 12  + U z + 12  - 1

where U (x) is the unit step function so that U (x) = 0 for x < 0 and U (x) = 1

for x  0.

The maximum reflection coefficient amplitude m = 0/ cosh A where 0 =

(ZL - ZS/(ZL + ZS) is the reflection coefficient when the load and source

are directly connected. Klopfenstein found that this introduced a small error

attributed to the limitation of the small reflection assumption. He determined
                                     1
that  a  better  estimate  is  0  =  2  ln(ZL/ZS ).  Thus

                               A = cosh-1 [ln(ZL/ZS)/m] .                         (7.45)

That is, m, the maximum reflection coefficient in the passband, and the
mismatch, ZL/ZS, determines A. Substituting Equation (7.45) in Equation
(7.44) yields

         ln Z0(z) = ln     ZSZL + ln        ZL/ZS m (ZL + ZS)
                                                           (ZL - ZS)

                  A2 (2z/, A) + U z - 12  + U z + 12  - 1                        (7.46)

     and the function (w, A) is computed as [12]

                                                                               (7.47)

                                                     k=0

     (summation up to k = 20 is sufficient) with the recursion formulas

     a0 = 1, ak =  A2         ak-1; b0 = 2 w, bk =1 12 w(1 - w2)k + 2kbk-1  .  (7.48)

                   4k(k + 1)                              2k + 1

     The results are shown in Figure 7-15.
     It is interesting to derive the characteristic impedance at the center of the
     taper. At the center of the taper, z = 0, (0, A) = 0 and Equation (7.44)
     becomes

                 ln Z0(0)  =  1  ln (ZSZL),     that is, Z0(0) =  ZS ZL,       (7.49)
                              2

     which is the geometric mean of the source and load resistances.
     The Klopfenstein taper trades off line length , minimum passband
     frequency fmin, and maximum passband reflection coefficient m. The
     passband of the taper is all frequencies above fmin. This is a remarkable result
     with the line length being considerably less than that of a linear taper. The
     limitation is that with such a short line the reflections along the line cannot
     always be considered to be small so that it is often necessary to increase the
     line length slightly above the length derived from this synthesis procedure.

typically be small and for a maximum transmission loss of between 0.1 dB
and 1 dB (corresponding to m = 0.151 and m = 0.454 respectively) and
maximum ZL/ZS = 10. Then the maximum value of A is 2.72 and this is
when the simplified Klopfenstein taper will have the most error. So retaining
only the first three terms in Equation (7.47), (w, A) can be approximated as

                 (w, A) = a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2  (7.50)

and used in Equation (7.46). A comparison of the calculated impedances for
a relatively high transmission loss of 1 dB (0.1 dB is more typical) and a large
impedance mismatch ZL/ZS = 10 is given in Table 7-2. The maximum error
of 1.33% is comparable to the characteristic impedance error of fabricated
transmission lines. So for practical purpose the simplified approach can be
used to design the Klopfenstein taper.

EXAMPLE 7.5 Design of a Klopfenstein Taper

      Design a microstrip Klopfenstein taper to match a ZS = 10  source to a ZL = 50  load.
      The maximum transmission ripple is to be 0.1 dB and the minimum passband frequency is
      8 GHz. The substrate has a thickness h = 0.635 탆, and relative permittivity r = 10.0.

      Solution:

      First determine the maximum reflection coefficient m in the passband. The minimum
      transmission in the passband is T = 100.1/20 and m = 1 - T 2 = 0.151. Since ZL/ZS = 5
     it is seen from Table 7-2 that the simplified Klopfenstein taper can be used with a maximum
      error of 1.33%. Using Equation (7.45) the required electrical length of the taper at 8 GHz is

                        A = cosh-1 [ln(ZL/ZS )/m] = cosh-1 [ln(50/5)/0.151] = 2.720.

      A taper with ten segments is chosen and in the table below the normalized length
      w = 2z/ is used to distinguish the parameter from the microstrip width w. The microstrip
      parameters were obtained by interpolating Table 3-3 of [6]. Z0 and 칎 are the average
      characteristic impedance and effective permittivity of a segment, a linear taper, extending
      from the width on the previous line to that on the same line. The electrical length of
      each segment is () = A/10 = 0.272 radians so that the physical length of a segment

                                 
       = 0.2728GHz/(2 e) where 8GHz = 3.745 cm is the free-space wavelength at 8 GHz.

         7.5.6 Comparison of Transmission Line Impedance

                  Transformers

         In this section the four main impedance transformers are compared: the
         linear taper, the Klopfenstein taper, the quarter-wave transformer and the
         two-section quarter-wave transformer. These transformers are lengths of
         nonuniform transmission line with a characteristic impedance that varies
         along the length of the line, i.e. Z0 = Z0(z) where z is the position along
         the line of total length . The N -section quarter-wave transformer has step
         changes in Z0(z) at n/4 where n = 1, 2 < . . . N but practically N = 1 or 2
         is the limit usually considered as much better performance can be obtained
         with the Klopfenstein taper with a legth typically between /4 and /2.
         Figure 7-16 compares the performance of the tapers for ZS = 25  and
         ZL = 50  but the results are applicable in general for ZL/ZS = 2. Figure
         7-16(a) shows the Z0 profile for the transmission line transformers and
         where the length of the linear taper has been chosen to provide comparable
         passband responses defined as where the transmission loss is less than
         0.1 dB corresponding to a maximum reflection coefficient m = 0.151 and a
         minimum transmission factor T = 0.989. The reflection coefficient response
         is shown in Figure 7-16(b). First consider the responses of the quarter-wave
         transformers. Both provide an ideal match at the passband center frequency
         f0 = 10 GHz and this repeats at odd multiples of f0 as a 3/4-long line is
         electrically identical to a /4-long line. The linear taper, chosen here as m/2
         long where m is the guide wavelength at f0, has a reflection coefficient
         mismatch that reduces as frequency increases as then the line becomes
         electrically longer.
         The Klopfenstein taper for m = 0.151 and ZL/ZS = 2 has A = 1.1103
         so that the passband of the Klopfenstein taper extends indefinitely above
         an electrical length of 1.1103 radians which defines the physical length of
         the line for a chosen minimum passband frequency fmin. The design choice
         here is fmin = 0.532f0 so that fmin was comparable to that of the two-
         section quarter-wave transformer. Then the electrical line length required
         is 0.87m/2. That is, a slightly shorter Klopfenstein taper has the same
         minimum passband frequency as a two-section quarter-wave transformer.

The Klopfenstein taper has the distinct advantage that the passband extends
indefinitely above fmin where as one-stage and multi-stage quarter-wave
transformers have a finite bandwidth.
The previous paragraph considered matching when ZL/ZS = 2. A similar
comparison is shown in Figure 7-17 for a much higher source and load
impedance discontinuity with ZS = 5  and ZL = 50  and the results are
applicable in general for ZL/ZS = 10. Figure 7-17(a) shows the Z0 profile
for the transmission line transformers and where the length of the linear
taper has been chosen to provide comparable passband responses defined as
where the transmission loss is less than 0.1 dB (corresponding to a maximum
reflection coefficient magnitude of 0.151). The reflection coefficient response
is shown in Figure 7-17(b). First consider the responses of the single- and
two-section quarter-wave transformers. Both provide an ideal match at the
passband center frequency f0 = 10 GHz and repeating at odd multiples of f0.
Again the passband defined by the two-section quarter-wave transformer is
used to determine the length of the linear and Klopfenstein tapers resulting
in the linear taper being 3m long and the Klopfenstein taper being 0.595 m
long, slightly longer than the two-section quarter-wave transformer. The
linear taper, chosen here to be m/2 long where m is the guide wavelength
at f0, has a reflection coefficient mismatch that reduces as frequency increases

     The Klopfenstein taper for m = 0.151 and ZL/ZS = 10 has A = 2.720 so
     that the passband of the Klopfenstein taper extends indefinitely above an
     electrical length of 2.720 radians and so choosing the minimum passband
     frequency fmin determines the physical length of the line.
     The 0.1 dB passbands of the transmission line transformers are compared in
     Table 7-3. The two-section quarter-wave transformer and the Klopfenstein
     transformer have comparable performance near the center frequency of the
     design with the choice being made on whether it is more important to have

good transmission properties indefinitely above fmin or to provide some
frequency selectivity by having a poorer match at the second harmonic
frequency of the center match frequency, here f0.

7.5.7 Summary

The transmission line transformers considered in this section match resistive
source and load impedances. However these impedance transformers
provide guidance for design strategies when the source and load include
reactances. When the source and load are resistances then the clear choice for
a transmission-line-based impedance transformer is the Klopfenstein tape.
With a reactive load the challenge is achieving broadband match since of
course the reactance of the load and/or load will vary with frequency and
so impose an overall bandwidth constraint. Design of the matching network
needs to take into account the frequency characteristic of the load.
Different loads will have different frequency characteristics and hence
variations in the type of matching network required. Four basic loads that are
commonly encountered in microwave engineering and to which matching is
required include the series RC model of the input of a FET transistor with
a series reactance that is inversely proportional to frequency; the series LR
model encountered in bonding to the input of a device where the inductance
comes from a bond wire and which has a series reactance that is proportional
to frequency; and a parallel RC load encountered at the output of a transistor
with a susceptance that reduces with frequency. These two-element models
of sources and loads are simple and other parasitics may need to be included.
At microwave frequencies the Q of the impedances encountered with active
devices is typically in the range of 0.5 to 3, and source/load resistance
mismatch typically ranges from 1.5 to 10. For example, high mismatches are
encountered at the output of power amplifiers.

7.6 Matching a Series RC load

The matching network design described in this section is appropriate for
a real source impedance and series RC load where the load resistance is
less than the source resistance. Also a two-section quarter-wave impedance
transformer will be considered as this has performance that is representative
of what is reasonable to achieve using transmission-line based impedance
transformers. Tapers are not considered here as their particular advantage of
an indefinite passband when matching resistive source and load impedance
disappears when the load (or source) is reactive.

Design Examples

Figure 7-18(a) presents the problem of matching to the input of a transistor
which is modeled here as a capacitor in series with a resistive load. This is
the typical model for the input of a FET.
With a two-section cascaded quarter-wave transformer an appropriate
matching network is shown in Figure 7-18(b). This topology is based on the
design concepts shown in Figures 7-18(c, d and e) where the single-frequency
reflection coefficient loci with respect to increasing line length are shown. The
overall concept is that line 3 rotates the load impedance to a resistance RX
and then RX is matched to RS using a two-section quarter-wave transformer,

quarter-wave impedance transformer. The arrows in (c), (d), and (e) indicate increasing line
length at 10 GHz. The Smith charts are normalized to Z03 and present three design concepts.
(The choice of high Z03 is appropriate for RL < ZS and a capacitor in the load.)

     that is, lines 1 and 2.
     At 10 GHz the 294 fF capacitor has a reactance of -54.13  and with the
     resistive part of the load the input of the transistor has a Q of 2.36. This is
     plotted on the 50  Smith chart in Figure 7-18(c). The design concept is that
     line 3 rotates the load ZL to a purely resistive load of 10.0 . Then a /4-long
     line, line 2, rotates the reflection coefficient to an intermediate impedance,
     and this is followed by line 1, another /4-long line which takes the input
     impedance to 50 . Note that the electrical lengths of the lines are given by

     the angle subtended by the arcs and do not correspond to the drawn lengths
     of the arcs. Here the electrical length of line 1 is 50.0 and that of lines 2 and
     3 are 90.

     Two alternative design concepts are shown in Figures 7-18(d and e). Figure 7-
     18(d) describes a low impedance (Z03  50 ) design concept. If Z03 = 20 
     then the electrical length of the line is 72.3 and the intermediate impedance
     ZX = 2.41 . An alternative is to use a high characteristic impedance for line
     3 as outlined in Figure 7-18(e). With Z03 = 100  the electrical length of line
     3 is 29.4 and ZX = 17.54 . Of these three design concepts the third design
     concept with the highest Z03 is preferable on two accounts. One of these
     is that the electrical length of line 3 is the smallest, and since the electrical
     lengths of lines 1 and 2 are fixed (each is /8 long), this results in the lowest

     overall electrical line length. Secondly the intermediate resistance is closest

Table 7-4 compares several trial designs with varying Z03 and it is apparent

that the characteristic impedance of Z03 needs to be high. A maximum Z03

of 100  is typical of many transmission line technologies and especially of

planar transmission lines like microstrip. Note that the maximum bandwidth

is 11% which is considerably less than the approximately 90% bandwidth

that could be obtained for a two-section quarter-wave transformer if the

capacitance in the load was not present (see Table 7-3).

The transmission characteristics of the matching network designed using

four values of Z03 ranging from 10  to 100  are shown in Figure 7-19(a).

Examination of the Smith chart plot, Figure 7-19(b), reveals the fundamental

problem in broadband matching of reactive loads to a resistive source

impedance. First consider the frequency locus of the load ZL which is

seen to have a clockwise rotation on the Smith chart as is typical of non-

resonant impedances. Matching requires that the impedance presented by

        into port 2 of the matching network (in Figure 7-18(a)) for each of the four

        designs are also plotted in Figure 7-19(b). These all rotate in the clockwise

        direction so that it is only possible for these matching networks to present

        the         desired  impedance    Z      at   a  single  frequency,  here  10  GHz.  The        angular

        length of the out loci from 6 GHz to 14 GHz for the four designs differ.

        The line with Z03 = 100  has the shortest out locus having the shortest

        total angular length (and hence shortest electrical and physical lengths). The

        passband responses of the various designs are shown in Figure 7-19(a) and

        the broadest passband response is obtained when Z03 = 100  and this

        impedance is about the largest that could be tolerated for a planar line as

        otherwise the microstrip characteristic impedance is become close to the

        377  free space and radiation (and this loss) from the microstrip line is

        starting to be significant.

        7.6.1 Summary

        The lessons learned from the design in this section can be generalized with
        the results shown in Table 7-5. While these results were obtained for a
        particular form of the load (a series RC load) they are a broad indication of

Table 7-5: Bandwidths achievable for various RL/ZS ratios and Qs using the two-section
quarter-wave transformer of Figure 7-18(b) and Z03 = 2ZS. The percentage bandwidth is
calculated as 100 times the difference of the high and low frequencies of the passband divided by
the ideal match frequency, f0. The notation >33 indicates that the passband is at all frequencies
above 0.33f0 as for small impedance discontinuities and low Q, the two-section transformer is
close to being a linear taper. Q is inversely proportion to frequency. Transmission losses of 0.1 dB,
0.2 dB, 0.5 dB, and 1.0 dB correspond to a maximum |in| in the passband of |m| = 0.151, 0.212,
0.330, and 0.454 respectively. (The same bandwidths are obtained with inverted values of RL/ZS
but requires a different design concept for the matching network.)

what can be achieved without exploiting resonance in the matching network.
(Resonance is a technique to obtain improved results and is be considered in
Section 7.7.) The performance metrics in Table 7-5 are much more realistic
than the Fano-Bode limits which could require lossless networks of infinite
complexity, and only consider the average passband reflection coefficient
rather than the maximum in-band reflection coefficient.
For example, with a factor of 2 difference between ZL and ZS and with a Q
of 1, the fractional bandwidth that can be readily achieved is 27%, 55%, 38%,
and 74% for maximum passband losses of 0.1 dB, 0.2 dB, 0.5 dB, and 1 dB
respectively. Since matching networks are not usually used for frequency
selectivity (which is more appropriate for a filter), and since there will be
multiple matching networks in a design, it is common to use a maximum
transmission loss of 0.1 dB as a passband criterion.

7.6.2 Matching using Cascaded Transmission Lines and
         Constant Q Circles

The stepped-impedance transformer designs utilizing quarter-wavelength-
long lines can be very long. In this section the design of a stepped-impedance
transmission line transformer with shortened lines is considered. Design is
conceptually derived from the quarter-wave transformer but design choices
are made based on constant Q circles.
First consider the single-line matching problem shown in Figure 7-20(a).
The normalized impedances are plotted on a Smith chart with constant Q
circles in Figure 7-20(b). A detailed view is given in Figure 7-20(c) and this
will be used to describe the design procedure. The normalizing reference
impedance Z0 is arbitrary and does not need to be related to the source or
load impedance, or to the characteristic impedance of the line.
Figure 7-21(a) shows a quarter-wavelength-long transmission line matching
a normalized load zL to a normalized source impedance zS with the arrow
on the reflection coefficient locus indicating the direction of increasing line
length. The arc subtends an angle of 180 corresponding to the line having
an electrical length of 90, i.e. it is /4 long. The maximum Q along the arc is
near 0.6 indicating an approximate fractional bandwidth of 1/Q or 1.6.
Greater bandwidth of the match can be obtained by using more line sections
and matching to an intermediate impedance. This situation is shown in
Figure 7-21(b) where there are two quarter-wavelength-long transmission

                                                                                             
lines each matching to a normalized intermediate resistance rv = zszL
since both zs and zL are resistances. The two arcs in the locus each are part of
a circle whose center can be used to determine the characteristic impedance
of each of the lines. As an approximation, the center of the circle containing
the arc for transmission line n is Cn referenced to the impedance Z0 and
then Z0n  Z0(1 + 2C0n) (see Section 4.5). (Of course we already know

                                                                                       
that each of the lines is a quarter-wave transformer so Z01 = Z0 zsrv and

            
Z02 = Z0 zvrL). The maximum Q set by the matching network is now 0.28
so the fractional bandwidth has increased to 1/0.28 = 3.57. This process can
be continued indefinitely. With a matching network with three quarter-wave
lines, as shown in Figure 7-21(c) the maximum Q is further reduced and the
fractional bandwidth increased.
The cascaded quarter-wave lines can reliably be used to obtain wide-
bandwidth matching but the overall length of the network becomes quite
230  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

     large. A more compact matching network with shorter overall line length
     can be obtained using lines that are shorter than /4. Such a network design
     is shown in Figure 7-21(d) with electrical lengths of each of the three lines
     being less than that of a quarter-wave line (each is about /8 long). The
     design problem then becomes one of determining the number of lines (or
     sections), determining the electrical lengths of the lines, the s, and then the
     characteristic impedance of the lines.
     A reasonably good estimate can be obtained using a Smith chart and the
     constant Q circles. Generally maximum bandwidth is obtained if no one
     point on the locus sets the maximum circuit Q. A better solution is when
     multiple arcs on the locus all touch the same Q line.
     While the illustration used here has resistive load and source impedances
     the technique can be used with complex source and load impedances.
     The complicating factor is that if the source and/or load impedances have
     reactances, then the source and load impedances will vary with frequency.
     Still resistive matching provides a good initial point in a design and starting
     from here optimization in a microwave circuit simulator can be used to
     finalize a design. A good approach is to absorb the impedance variation with
     frequency into the matching network.

7.7 Broadband Matching to Reactive Loads

Previous sections presented methods for broadband matching to resistive
loads. Usually these techniques work quite well if the load is moderately
reactive but this is not always the case. Inputs and outputs of transistors
can have larger reactive parts than resistive parts. Broadband matching to
such loads requires customization taking into account the frequency locus of
the loads which nearly always rotates in the clockwise direction on a Smith
chart so that the locus of the complex conjugate match rotates in the counter-
clockwise direction. Circuits that achieve broadband match to these loads
exploit resonance and as such have limited bandwidths so that half-octave
matching is usually the most that can be achieved.

7.7.1 Broadband Matching to a Series RC Load

Consider matching to the input of a transistor. A transistor such as a FET
has an input that can be modeled as a capacitor in series with a resistor as
shown in Figure 7-22(a). At 10 GHz the 294 fF capacitor has a reactance of
-54.06  so that the Q of the load is 2.36. The Fano-Bode limit, see Equation
(7.7), indicates that the maximum fractional bandwidth that can be achieved

                         for an average reflection coefficient, avg, at Port 1 of 0.11 is 60%. This avg
                         corresponds to an average transmission loss of 0.05 dB for a maximum
                         transmission loss of approximately 0.1 dB in the bandwidth of the match.
                         (Note that if the load was purely resistive, then Q = 0 and it is theoretically
                         possible to achieve infinite bandwidth.)
                         Matching would be greatly simplified if the matching network presented a
                         negative capacitor to the load. The reactance normalized to 54.06  versus
                         frequency of the required negative capacitance (of capacitance -294 fF) is
                         shown as the curve identified as -C in Figure 7-22(d). At the normalized
                         frequency f = 1 (frequency normalized to 10 GHz) the slope of this curve
                         is -1. A circuit that approximates this over a moderate bandwidth is the
                         broadband matching network shown in Figure 7-22(b). To see how this
                         is achieved, consider the input impedance of the circuit in Figure 7-22(c).
                         The reactance of the parallel LC subcircuit is shown in Figure 7-22(d) as
                         the curve labeled C1 L1. At f^ = 1 this reactance has a slope of -2 and
                         adding a series inductor, L2, (having the reactance curve L2 in Figure 7-
                         22(d)) results in a reactance x, see Figure 7-22(d), which does have a slope
                         of -1 at f^ = 1. Thus the total reactance, x, closely matches the reactance of a
                         negative capacitor over a limited, but still broad, bandwidth. The other part

of the matching problem is matching the source and load resistances and
with appropriate choice of matching network values the resistance r (ideally
22.9  normalized to 54.06 ) will be approximately constant in the matching
region, see Figure 7-22(e).
A microstrip realization centered at 10 GHz of the broadband matching
network concept is shown in Figure 7-23(a). At Port 1 is an open-circuited
stub with a relatively short electrical length at 10 GHz and so presents the
capacitance C1. This is followed by a short section of line that separates the
two stubs and provides an extra degree of freedom to be used in matching
the source and load resistances. Then follows a short shorted stub that
implements L1. This is followed by a short high-impedance line which
introduces the series inductance L2 (see Section 2.4.5 of [6]). The performance
of the matching network is shown in Figure 7-23(c) where it is compared to
that of a narrowband matching network. The narrowband network, shown
in Figure 7-23(b), is a conventional two-element matching network designed
using the absorption method so that the 294 fF capacitor is absorbed into the
network but still requires an additional inductance L4 to compensate for the
capacitance. The match of both the broadband and narrowband matching
networks is ideal at 10 GHz. The in loci of the two networks are shown on
a 50  Smith chart in Figure 7-23(c).
The range of match for a maximum transmission loss of 0.1 dB is from
9.04 GHz to 11.53 GHz (a 2.49 GHz bandwidth) for the broadband network
and 9.47 GHz to 10.62 GHz (a 1.15 GHz bandwidth) for the narrowband
network. Using a 0.5 dB bandwidth criterion the bandwidth of the region
of match for the broadband microstrip network is 8.13 GHz to 12.95 GHz
234  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN, NETWORKS

     (a 4.82 GHz bandwidth) and the narrowband network has a passband from
     8.54 GHz to 12.34 GHz (a 3.80 GHz bandwidth).
     Also plotted in Figure 7-23(c) is S22 of the broadband microstrip network and
     from this the reason why a good match is achieved can be seen. Typically
     the reflection coefficient locus of simple networks rotates clockwise on the
     Smith chart with increasing frequency. For a small frequency range near the
     center match frequency S22 has a loop and effectively rotates in the counter-
     clockwise direction approximating the locus of a negative capacitor. Such
     a behavior is obtained in the lumped element version of the broadband
     network by the resonance of L1, C1, and L2. A very good match is therefor
     possible over a small frequency range. The good match is obtained over
     about half an octave (of frequency) and this is typically the best that can be
     achieved when matching to the inputs and outputs of microwave transistors.
     The microstrip broadband matching network has a finite length and width.
     Including the widths as well as the lengths of the lines, the broadband
     matching network has a width and length of 0.11 , considerably less than
     that of a quarter-wave transformer used to match resistive source and load
     impedances when they are resistive but not when the load has a large
     reactance as here.

     7.7.2 Summary

     The broadband matching concept presented in this section is using resonance
     to present an impedance to a load or source that rotates in the counter-
     clockwise direction (with respect to frequency) on a Smith chart. This
     is achievable only over a moderate bandwidth and typically half-octave
     bandwidths are regarded as the limit of what can be achieved when
     matching to a load that is more reactive than resistive. There are techniques
     also that are sometimes able to achieve broader effective matches by
     incorporating the parasitic reactances of a device to be matched into a
     distributed transmission line.

     7.8 Summary

     This chapter presented design concepts for realizing matching networks
     with broad bandwidths. Matching a load and/or a source with a reactance
     presents a particular problem because reactive loads include energy storage
     elements and energy storage elements limit bandwidth. Theoretically, if
     negative capacitances and inductors could be realized then it would be
     possible to have infinite bandwidth matching of complex loads and/or
     sources provided that the elements of the matching network are lossless.
     Since negative capacitors and inductors cannot be realized, there will be
     a limit on matching bandwidth. The Fano-Body limits indicate the trade-
     off between the quality of the match in terms of the minimum reflection
     coefficient that can be achieved and the bandwidth of the match. While
     ideal magnetic transformers can achieve infinite matching of source and
     load resistors, actual magnetic transformers have self inductances and thus
     energy storage and so matching bandwidth is limited even with magnetic
     transformers.
     All matching networks introduce energy storage elements. This includes
     capacitor, inductor, and transmission line elements, as well as magnetic
IMPEDANCE MATCHING                                                              235

transformers. Thus design techniques are required that enable design trade-
offs of the quality of a match and bandwidth. The constant Q circles on a
Smith chart enable the maximum Q and hence fractional bandwidth, which
is very approximately 1/Q, of a matched to be controlled. As long as the
locus of the input reflection coefficient of an evolving terminated matching
network does not go outside a specific pair of equal-valued constant Q circles
the bandwidth is constrained. This concept applies to loads and sources that
are resistive only or include reactances. The stepped-impedance and tapered
transmission-line matching networks presented enable broadband matching
of source and load resistances but the concepts of gradual matching in stages
to interim resistances levels can be extrapolated to matching general sources
and loads.
The final concept of this chapter describes a topology for matching a reactive
load, in particular a load comprising a resistor and a capacitor. This is
what the input and output of a transistor looks like. The matching network
described in Section 7.7 approximates a negative capacitor over a limited
bandwidth and is one of the best such networks known and this matching
network topology is commonly used in matching the input and output
of transistors. Other broadband network topologies have been invented
and these developments are tracked by microwave engineers involved in
matching network design.

MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: NETWORKS                          Third Edition

Microwave and RF Design: Networks presents the tools and techniques required to analyze and design
microwave and RF circuits. Because of the finite speed of light, microwave circuits must be considered to be
spatially distributed and so there is not a single ground. As such metrics that can be used to describe power
flow are of most use. The topics covered include scattering parameters, signal flow graphs, and Smith charts.
Acquiring expertise in these is the biggest barriers to a successful career in microwave and RF engineering.
This book is suitable as both an undergraduate and graduate textbook, as well as a career-long reference
book.
