PREFACE  vii

Preface

This book is written for undergraduate students and teachers engaged in electrical and com-
puter engineering (ECE) design projects, primarily in the senior year. The objective of the
text is to provide a treatment of the design process in ECE with a sound academic basis that is
integrated with practical application. This combination is necessary in design projects because
students are expected to apply their theoretical knowledge to bring useful systems to reality.
This topical integration is reflected in the subtitle of the book: Theory, Concepts, and Practice.
Fundamental theories are developed whenever possible, such as in the chapters on functional
design decomposition, system behavior, and design for reliability. Many aspects of the design
process are based upon time-tested concepts that represent the generalization of successful
practices and experience. These concepts are embodied in processes presented in the book, for
example, in the chapters on needs identification and requirements development. Regardless of
the topic, the goal is to apply the material to practical problems and design projects. Overall,
we believe that this text is unique in providing a comprehensive design treatment for ECE,
something that is sorely missing in the field. We hope that it will fill an important need as
capstone design projects continue to grow in importance in engineering education.

    We have found that there are three important pieces to completing a successful design
project. The first is an understanding of the design process, the second is an understanding
of how to apply technical design tools, and the third is successful application of professional
skills. Design teams that effectively synthesize all three tend to be far more successful than
those that don't. The book is organized into three parts that support each of these areas.

    The first part of the book, the Design Process, embodies the steps required to take an idea
from concept to successful design. At first, many students consider the design process to be
obvious. Yet it is clear that failure to understand and follow a structured design process often
leads to problems in development, if not outright failure. The design process is a theme that
is woven throughout the text; however, its main emphasis is placed in the first four chapters.
Chapter 1 is an introduction to design processes in different ECE application domains. Chapter
2 provides guidance on how to select projects and assess the needs of the customer or user.
Depending upon how the design experience is structured, both students and faculty may be
faced with the task of selecting the project concept. Further, one of the important issues in
the engineering design is to understand that systems are developed for use by an end-user, and
if not designed to properly meet that need, they will likely fail. Chapter 3 explains how to
develop the Requirements Specification along with methods for developing and documenting
the requirements. Practical examples are provided to illustrate these methods and techniques.
Chapter 4 presents concept generation and evaluation. A hallmark of design is that there are
many potential solutions to the problem. Designers need to creatively explore the space of
possible solutions and apply judgment to select the best one from the competing alternatives.

    The second part of the book, Design Tools, presents important technical tools that ECE de-
signers often draw upon. Chapter 5 emphasizes system engineering concepts including the well
known functional decomposition design technique and applications in a number of ECE prob-
lem domains. Chapter 6 provides methods for describing system behavior, such as flowcharts,
state diagrams, data flow diagrams and a brief overview of the Unified Modeling Language
(UML). Chapter 7 covers important issues in testing and provides different viewpoints on test-
ing throughout the development cycle. Chapter 8 addresses reliability theory in design, and
reliability at both the component and system level is considered.

    The third part of the book focuses on Professional Skills. Designing, building, and testing
a system is a process that challenges the best teams, and requires good communication and
project management skills. Chapter 9 provides guidance for effective teamwork. It provides
viii  CONTENTS

an overview of pertinent research on teaming and distills it into a set of heuristics. Chapter
10 presents traditional elements of project planning, such as the work breakdown structure,
network diagrams, and critical path estimation. It also addresses how to estimate manpower
needs for a design project. Chapter 11 addresses ethical considerations in both system design
and professional practice. Case studies for ECE scenarios are examined and analyzed using
the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Code of Ethics as a basis. The
book concludes with Chapter 12, which contains guidance for students preparing for oral
presentations, often a part of capstone design projects.

    Features of the Book
    This book aims to guide students and faculty through the steps necessary for the successful
execution of design projects. Some of the features are listed below.

     Each chapter provides a brief motivation for the material in the chapter followed by
       specific learning objectives.

     There are many examples throughout the book that demonstrate the application of the
       material.

     Each end-of-chapter problem has a different intention. Review problems demonstrate
       comprehension of the material in the chapter. Application problems require the solution
       of problems based upon the material learned in the chapter. Design problems are directly
       applicable to design projects and are usually tied in with the Project Application section.

     Nearly all chapters contain a Project Application section that describes how to apply the
       material to a design project.

     Some chapters contain a Guidance section that represents the author's advice on appli-
       cation of the material to a design project.

     Checklists are provided for helping students assess their work.

     There are many terms used in design whose meaning needs to be understood. The text
       contains a glossary with definitions of design terminology. The terms defined in the
       glossary (Appendix A) are indicated by italicized-bold highlighting in the text.

     All chapters conclude with a Summary and Further Reading section. The aim of the
       Further Reading portion is to provide pointers for those who want to delve deeper into
       the material presented.

     The book is structured to help programs demonstrate that they are meeting the ABET
       (accreditation board for engineering programs) accreditation criteria. It provides ex-
       amples of how to address constraints and standards that must be considered in design
       projects. Furthermore, many of the professional skills topics, such as teamwork, ethics,
       and oral presentation ability, are directly related to the ABET Educational Outcomes.
       The requirements development methods presented in Chapter 3 are valuable tools for
       helping students perform on cross-functional teams where they must communicate with
       non-engineers.

     An instructor's manual is available that contains not only solutions, but guidance from the
       authors on teaching the material and managing student design teams. It is particularly
       important to provide advice to instructors since teaching design has unique challenges
       that are different than teaching engineering science oriented courses that most faculty
       are familiar with.
PREFACE  ix

     PowerPointTM presentations are available for instructors through McGraw-Hill

     There are a number of complete case study student projects available in electronic form
       for download by both students and instructors and available at. These projects have
       been developed using the processes provided in this book.

    How to Use this Book
    There are several common models for teaching capstone design, and this book has the
flexibility to serve different needs. Particularly, chapters from the Professional Skills section
can be inserted as appropriate throughout the course. Recommended usage of the book for
three different models of teaching a capstone design course is presented.

     Model I. This is a two-semester course sequence. In the first semester, students learn
       about design principles and start their capstone projects. This is the model that we
       follow. In the first semester the material in the book is covered in its entirety. The
       order of coverage is typically Chapters 1-3, 9, 4-6, 10-11, and 7-8. Chapter 9 (Teams
       and Teamwork) is covered immediately after the projects are identified and the teams
       are formed. Chapters 10 (Project Management) and 11 (Ethical and Legal Issues) are
       covered after the system design techniques in Chapters 5 and 6 are presented. Students
       are in a good position to create a project plan and address ethical issues in their designs
       after learning the more technical aspects of design. Chapter 12 (Oral Presentations) is
       assigned to students to read before their first oral presentation to the faculty. The course
       concludes with principles of testing and system reliability (Chapter 7 and 8). We assign a
       good number of end-of-chapter problems and have quizzes throughout the semester. By
       the end of the first semester, design teams are expected to have completed development of
       the requirements, the high-level or architectural design, and developed a project plan. In
       the second semester, student teams implement and test their designs under the guidance
       of a faculty advisor.

     Model II. This two-semester course sequence is similar to Model I with the difference
       being that the first semester is a lower credit course (often one credit) taught in a seminar
       format. In this model chapters can be selected to support the projects. Some of the core
       chapters for consideration are Chapters 1-5, which take the student from project selection
       to functional design, and Chapters 9-11 on teamwork, project management, and ethical
       issues. Other chapters could be covered at the instructor's discretion. The use of end-
       of-chapter problems would be limited, but the project application sections and example
       problems in the text would be useful in guiding students through their projects.

     Model III. This is a one-semester design sequence. Here, the book would be used to
       guide students through the design process. Chapters for consideration are 1-5 and 9-10,
       which provide the basics of design, teamwork, and project management. The project
       application sections and problems could be used as guidance for the project teams.

The Engineering Design Process

       en-gi-neer (n) 1. One versed in the design, construction, and use of machines. 2.
       One who employs the innovative and methodical application of scientific knowledge
       and technology to produce a device, system, or process, which is intended to satisfy
       human needs. --American College Dictionary

    Take a moment to read and analyze the key elements of the two definitions presented above.
If you are an engineering student or practicing engineer, do you think that this definition applies
to you? The first definition uses the terms design and construction. People like to think of
themselves as designers. Why is that so? The answer may be in the combination of the term
construction, and from the second definition, the idea of innovation. Applying innovation and
creativity to produce something new is a wonderfully rewarding process. The great thing about
being an engineer is that it allows you to be a creative designer. That is generally not the way
the profession is viewed. What is the difference between engineering design and other types of
design that are associated with creativity such as interior design, fashion design, or webpage
design? The answer is supplied in the second definition which states ". . . methodical application
of scientific knowledge and technology. . . " As an engineering student, you have studied a great
deal of math, science, and fundamental technology, but probably have had limited exposure to
creative and innovative design.

    The definition also contains the somewhat contradictory terms innovative and methodical.
If there is an established and methodical way of employing a scientific principle or process, it
does not seem to allow much room for creativity and innovation. The truth is that the two
concepts are in competition with each other, but a good engineer realizes this and utilizes
both effectively. The definition also indicates that engineers design to satisfy human needs, an
important, yet often overlooked point. That means that when designing systems, it is necessary
to determine the user's needs and the ethical application of the technology.

    This book aims to help electrical and computer engineers become effective designers, to bet-
ter understand professional practices, and to provide guidance for executing design projects.
This chapter presents the processes by which designs are realized, the characteristics of suc-
cessful engineers, and an overview of the book.

     Understand what is meant by engineering design.

     Understand the phases of the engineering design process.

     Be familiar with the attributes of successful engineers.

     Understand the objectives of this book.

1.1 The Engineering Design Process

ABET (formerly known as Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology) provides the
following definition of engineering design [ABE03].

       Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to
       meet desired needs. It is a decision-making process (often iterative), in which
       the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert
       resources optimally to meet a stated objective. Among the fundamental elements
       of the design process are the establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis,
       analysis, construction, testing, and evaluation.

    The definition indicates that, in engineering design, different phases of the process have to
be re-visited and the deliverables for each phase updated as necessary. Realistic problems are
complex with many potential solutions; the goal is not to find just any solution, but the best one
given the constraints and available resources. This requires the application of sound judgment,
decision-making skills, and patience in constantly evaluating progress towards a solution. The
definition identifies some common elements of the design process, such as establishment of
criteria, synthesis, construction, and testing.

    Design processes embody the steps required to take an idea from concept to realization
of the final system, and are problem-solving methodologies that aim to develop a system that
best meets the customer's need within given constraints. This is not all that different from
some everyday processes, such as preparing dinner. Say you are hungry and need to eat dinner
before you can go to see a movie that starts in one hour. The constraints are time, money, food,
your tastes, and nutritional value if you are health-conscious. You brainstorm and come up
with the options of making dinner at home, going to a restaurant, or buying something to eat
at the theater. Based on these options, you then select the solution based on your evaluation
of the best one. This is similar in philosophy to the stages of design processes where you have
a problem to solve, constraints, and a number of potential solutions to select from.

    A related term is known as the product realization process. The product realization process
is broader in scope, including aspects such as entrepreneurship, market research, financial
planning, product pricing, and market strategy. Many technologies have their own particular
design processes that have evolved over time and have been found by practitioners in the field
to be valuable. For example, different methodologies are applied in the design of integrated
circuits (VLSI), embedded systems, and software systems, yet they all have some degree of
commonality, such as requirements analysis, technical design, and system test. Design processes
continue to evolve. One field in which this is particularly true is in software design due to the
1.1. THE ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS                  5

constantly changing nature of software and the special challenges that large software projects
pose.

    Cross [Cro00] identified two types of design processes--prescriptive and descriptive. As
the name implies, prescriptive design processes set down an exact process, or systematic
recipe, for realizing a system. Prescriptive design processes are often algorithmic in nature
and expressed using flow charts with decision logic. An example of a prescriptive process is
shown in Figure 1.1, which describes the front end of the design process where the problem
and requirements are determined. A decision block is included where the requirements are
examined to determine if they satisfy the needs of the problem. Descriptive processes are
less formal, describing typical activities involved in realizing designs with less emphasis on exact
sequencing. The distinction between descriptive and prescriptive processes is not always clear,
however, and some processes may be considered more strongly associated with one property
than the other. Cross makes an important point in stating that design processes are sometimes
viewed as common sense and thus ignored, resulting in failed products. Cross cites two good
reasons to adhere to design processes: 1) they formalize thought processes to ensure good
practices are followed, leading to better and more innovative solutions, and 2) they keep all
members of the team synchronized in terms of understanding where they are in the design
process.

Figure 1.1: A prescriptive design process for problem identification and requirements selection.

    A descriptive process that is widely applicable to design problems is shown in Figure 1.2. In
a perfect world, the process starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds clockwise to
research, followed the requirements phase, and so on until the system or device is delivered and
goes into service (maintenance phase). This scenario is unrealistic, ignoring the iterative nature
of design where the design team alternates between different phases as necessary. Consequently,
links are inserted that allow transitions between all the different phases of the

    design process. Of course, transitions between certain phases are unreasonable or very
costly. It is virtually impossible to move directly from problem identification to system in-
tegration without developing a design concept first. It is much more likely for engineers to
alternate between nearby phases in the process, such as problem identification, research, re-
quirements specification, and concept generation. This does not mean that you can't move
between phases that are not in close proximity in the model. For instance, the customer's
needs may change while in the design phase, necessitating re-evaluation of the needs, correc-
tion of the requirements specification, and system redesign--all at a substantial cost in time
and money. Studies have shown that the cost required to correct errors or make changes
increases exponentially as the project lifetime increases, as presented in Figure 1.3.

Elements of the Design Process

Nearly all the phases of the design process in Figure 1.2 are covered in this book, with the
exception of the maintenance phase. The objective of the first phase, problem identification,
is to identify the problem and customer needs. This occurs in a variety of ways, from someone
conceiving a new idea to a client coming to you with a problem to solve. In either case, it is
important to determine the true needs for the product, device, or system (terms that are used
interchangeably throughout the book and often referred to as systems). Failure to correctly
identify the needs has negative ramifications for the entire process, typically resulting in costly
redesigns, or even worse, abandonment of the project.

    In the research phase the design team conducts research on the basic engineering and
scientific principles, related technologies, and existing solutions. The objective is to become
experts on the problem, save time and money by not re-inventing the wheel, and be positioned
to develop new and innovative solutions.

    The Requirements Specification articulates what the system must do for it to be suc-
cessful and to be accepted by the customer. It is important to focus on what the system must
do, as opposed to how the solution will be implemented. This is challenging since engineers
tend to focus on solutions and propose implementations early in the process. This is not sur-

prising since engineering education focuses on solving problems rather than specifying them.
The requirements are the mission statement that guides the entire project, and if properly
developed, provide flexibility for creativity and innovation in developing solutions.

    In concept generation, many possible solutions to the problem are developed. The hall-
mark of design is that it is open-ended, meaning that there are multiple solutions to the
problem and the objective is to develop the one that best meets the requirements and satisfies
the constraints. In this phase, wild creativity is encouraged, but it is ultimately tempered with
critical evaluation of the competing alternatives.

    In the design phase, the team iteratively develops a technical solution, ultimately pro-
ducing a detailed system design. Upon its completion, all major systems and subsystems are
identified and described using an appropriate model that depends upon the particular technol-
ogy being employed.

    In the prototyping and construction phase, different elements of the system are con-
structed and tested. In rapid prototyping, the objective is to model some aspect of the system,
demonstrating functionality to be employed in the final realization. Many prototypes are
discarded or modified as the system evolves--the idea is to experiment, demonstrate proof-
of-concept principles, and improve understanding. Prototypes may be used anywhere in the
process--you may present the client with prototypes after the concept generation phase, or
they may be utilized in the design phase to test a design idea, or as the final system is tested
and developed.

    During system integration, all of the subsystems are brought together to produce a
complete working system. This phase is challenging and time-consuming since many different
pieces of the design must be interfaced, and the team must work closely to make it all work.
Care taken in the design phase to clearly communicate the functionality and interfaces between
subsystems aids in system integration. System integration is closely tied to the test phase,
where the overall system is tested to demonstrate that it meets the requirements.

    Ultimately the system is delivered to the customer where it is likely that they will test it
using a mutually agreed upon process. Development does not necessarily end when the system
goes into service, as it will likely enter the maintenance phase where it is maintained,
upgraded to add new functionality, or where design problems are corrected. Following and
understanding the design process improves the probability of successful system development.
The process is flexible, and the designer needs to transition between different phases in order to
bring the system to realization. Design is an iterative process--you may not fully understand
everything necessary in any given phase and have to revisit different steps as the system evolves.
8                               CHAPTER 1. THE ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS

That is not a license for not trying to develop the best design you can on the first attempt--by
all means do so--but realize that flexibility and a willingness to change the design are necessary.

Technology Specific Design Processes

Different application domains have developed specialized processes for technology-specific de-
sign. One such example is VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design. A typical VLSI design
process is shown in Figure 1.4 [Wol02]. In this model the system specification is used to develop
the system architecture. The system architecture is composed of the major functional units
that constitute an integrated circuit. Each functional unit is then designed at the gate logic
level, which is subsequently designed at the circuit (transistor) level, and finally the circuit
elements are laid out on the silicon chip. This is an excellent demonstration of the divide-
and-conquer approach to design, where a complex system is broken down into lower levels of
abstraction and each of these is further broken down until the design objectives are met.

                  Architecture

                  Figure 1.4: A process for integrated circuit (VLSI) design [Wol02].

    Next, consider the design process for embedded computer systems shown in Figure 1.5.
Embedded systems are combined hardware/software systems embedded into a larger system
to perform dedicated application specific operations. Embedded systems are employed in
automobiles, DVD players, and digital cameras to name a few applications. Performance issues
dominate embedded applications, and the designer needs to partition tasks between software
and hardware to achieve optimum performance. This design process is somewhat prescriptive
with phases for requirements gathering, specifications, and architectural design. The process
reflects the unique nature of embedded systems with separate software and hardware design
blocks, married together by the interface design.

    The field of software engineering is one in which the development of different design process
models is still under considerable flux today. This is due to the complex nature of software
and the failure of computer scientists and engineers to effectively develop high-quality software
systems. There are many reasons why this is so. The sheer size of software programs may
easily exceed one million lines of code written by many different software developers. One
small mistake in those millions of lines of code can cause the system to fail. Another difficulty
is in designing for upgrade and reuse of software. What if the needs change after the millions
of lines of code are developed and one of the fundamental structures or objects needs to be
upgraded?

    The waterfall model shown in Figure 1.6 is one of the first proposed and most well-known
software design processes. This is a prescriptive model since the development proceeds linearly
from the first step where the user's needs are analyzed through the phases of specification
development, design, test, and maintenance. This works for well-defined and moderately com-
plex software applications, but fails as complexity grows due to the inability to move between
phases. A more flexible and descriptive software design process is known as the spiral model,
which is a cyclical process where phases are revisited as necessary [Som01]. Extreme Program-
ming is a more recent and controversial software development process, where relatively small
teams of software developers rapidly develop software following some strict rules. Both the

problems.

1.2 The World-Class Engineer

The ability to effectively design is important for engineers, requiring strong technical skills
and an understanding of the design process. Yet, this ability in itself is not enough to become
an effective practicing engineer. The Pennsylvania State University Leonhard Center for the
Advancement of Engineering Education, in consultation with a number of industries, developed
a description of what is referred to as a "World-Class Engineer" [Leo95]. Shown in Table 1.1,
the description identifies the characteristics of successful engineers, and contains six major
elements: 1) Aware of the World, 2) Solidly Grounded, 3) Technically Broad, 4) Effective in
Group Operations, 5) Versatile, and 6) Customer-Oriented. The description recognizes that
engineers must be effective in group operations, since the majority of projects are carried out
in teams. Not only that, many projects span multiple technical disciplines and are executed
in multifunctional organizations that have diverse groups such as marketing, finance, human
resources, technical support, and service. It also recognizes that an engineer must be versatile,
innovative, understand ethical principles, and be customer-oriented, important themes that
are stressed throughout this book.

1.3 Book Overview

Consider the digital camera, the cellular phone, and the space shuttle, all complex systems
that integrate a variety of technologies. A digital camera is the synthesis of an embedded
electronics system, optics, a mechanical lens assembly, and the camera package itself. The
embedded electronics contain an imaging sensor, a digital display, digital interface circuitry,
flash memory storage, system control software, and the user interface. The challenges of
integrating the components of such a system and having it record and transfer huge amounts
12  CHAPTER 1. THE ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS

of image data, within an acceptable timeframe, are immense. Cellular phones are another good
example of a complex system that represents a technology that has shrunk in size, but increased
tremendously in functionality at the same time. They encompass digital data communications,
antenna design, encryption for secure data transmission, a user interface display, and Internet
connectivity. At the other end of the spectrum are large-scale space and military systems, such
as the space shuttle. Despite the two shuttle accidents, the safety and reliability requirements of
the space shuttle are incredibly high. Realizing such a system is accomplished by a tremendous
number of people from many disciplines working for different organizations. All three of these
technologies were developed by large teams that encompass multiple disciplines. The processes
and practices employed in their development represent application of the fundamentals that
this book hopes to cover. While you won't be building complete space shuttles by the end
of this design course, you can expect to apply design principles that allow you to design and
integrate a relatively complex system, maybe even a part of the space shuttle.

    The intention is to teach the application of design principles to computer and electrical
engineers and to help prepare students for a professional career. The majority of engineering
education is devoted to math, science, engineering science, and problem-solving. They are
important topics required to enter this highly technical field. However, it is clear that there are
other aspects beyond this that are equally important for success, including an understanding
of system design, innovation, ethical principles, teamwork, and strong communication skills.

    The book is divided into three parts: I-Design Process, II-Design Tools, and III-Professional
Skills. This is shown in Figure 1.7 as three separate, but related components that play a key
role in achieving Project Excellence--the ability to complete a project, in an ethical manner
that meets the customer's need, satisfies the constraints, and is clearly communicated to all
involved. The chapters are decoupled as much as possible so that the reader can move between
chapters as necessary. In Part I, the emphasis is on understanding and gaining experience in
the different phases of the design process. The reader is guided through the steps of project
identification, research, specification development, creative concept generation, and critical
evaluation of competing solutions. Part II addresses topics that are often employed in design,
including functional decomposition, description of system behavior, reliability, and testing.
Part III addresses professional skills, including teamwork principles, project planning, ethics
in design and the profession, and oral communication skills.

    Here are a few thoughts to conclude the chapter and get started on the path to great
designs. You are embarking on what will likely be a fun, challenging, sometimes frustrating,
and ultimately rewarding journey. The systems that engineers work with continue to become
increasingly complex and multi-disciplinary in nature. The example problems presented in this
book come from the fields of analog electronics, digital electronics, electrical systems theory,
and software systems. These four areas comprise a significant problem-domain common to
the education of most electrical and computer engineers. Finally, consider the quote below by
Robert Hayes on the importance of design.

    Fifteen years ago, companies competed on price. Today it's quality. Tomorrow it's design.--
Robert H. Hayes, Harvard Business School, 1991.

    What is this saying? Well, it is clear that the world continues to move to a more knowledge-
based society, where individuals and companies compete on the strength of their intellectual
capital and ability to produce new and innovative products. That is what design is all about.
It is not saying that price and quality are unimportant, they certainly are; in fact quality and
reliability in design are part of this book. It is that quality and price are a given, and successful
products will be distinguished by their design characteristics. The implication is that design
will play a larger role in the development and success of products. The future Hayes predicted
is now. Design is what distinguishes between products that are seen as commodities and those

1.4 Summary and Further Reading

Engineering design is an iterative process in which the design team employs creativity and
technical knowledge to develop a solution that best meets the end-users' needs within the
constraints applied to the problem. There is no single design process that can be applied to
all situations and technologies, but there are many common elements shared, regardless of the
technology under consideration. In order to successfully bring designs to fruition, it takes a
combination of design tools, professional skills, and a clear understanding of the process needed
to complete designs. The objective of this book is to develop your proficiency in these areas
so that you may become an effective engineer and achieve excellence in design projects.

    Engineering Design Methods by Nigel Cross [Cro00] presents the differences between de-
scriptive and prescriptive design processes, and covers a wide array of processes in more de-
tail. It also discusses the cognitive characteristics of effective designers. There are many
good books on software engineering process development methods. Software Engineering by
Ian Sommerville [Som01] discusses the different software design process models, such as the
waterfall and spiral models. This is also true of many modern software engineering texts.
The original reference to the waterfall model is by Royce [Roy70]. The Art of Innovation by
Michael Kelley [Kel01] describes the activities of well-known design company IDEO and is a
highly readable description of their design practices. The ABC Nightline news program also
produced an interesting segment on IDEO [ABC01] that can be purchased at the ABC web-
site. The Circle of Innovation by Tom Peters [Pet97] is another popular book that provides
his perspective on current trends in business and the importance of design.

Project Selection and Needs
Identification

       For every problem there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong.--H.L. Mencken
    Traditionally, companies have organized resources based on functions such as accounting,
engineering, finance, manufacturing, and marketing. It is often more effective to organize
around projects that are of significant value and align resources to meet the needs of the project.
This means that traditional departments and middle management are being de-emphasized and
the role of projects is growing. Capstone design projects provide a great opportunity to gain
experience in the management and execution of a project. One of the first and most important
decisions encountered is selecting a project to pursue.
    The objective of this chapter is to provide pragmatic guidance in the project selection
phase. A description of design and engineering projects is presented, followed by advice on
how projects can be selected by engineering students who wish to put design principles into
practice. The chapter addresses how to identify the needs of the end-user and provides guidance
for conducting background research. All of this information is brought together in a Problem
Statement that identifies the needs, the goals of the project, and research on the technology.

16  CHAPTER 2. PROJECT SELECTION AND NEEDS IDENTIFICATION

2.1 Engineering Design Projects

This section provides a classification of design and describes some of the types of projects
undertaken by practicing engineers and those tackled in student projects. In reality, most
projects don't fit neatly into the categories presented, but are some combination of them. The
objective of a design project is to create a new artifact (system, component, or process) to
meet a given need. Within the design domain there are different types of designs that are
classified broadly into three categories of Creative, Routine, and Variant designs [Cro00].

    Creative designs represent new and innovative products. An example of a creative design
is the Palm Pilot Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). While the idea for the PDA had been
around for awhile, earlier attempts at developing the technology, notably the Apple Newton,
were unsuccessful. This was primarily due to unreliable handwriting recognition that frustrated
the user. However, Palm Computing had the creative idea to develop a simplified handwriting
language, Graffiti, which eliminated the need for natural handwriting recognition. The Palm
Pilot is a great example of a creative design--it is simple (four basic functions), fits in your
pocket, and is easy to use. This innovation spawned a huge hand-held computing industry.

    Variant designs are variations of existing designs, where the intent is to improve perfor-
mance or add features to an existing system. Many engineering projects fall into this category.
For example, the objective may be to increase accuracy or system throughput.

    Routine designs represent the design of devices for which theory and practice are well-
developed. Examples are DC power supplies, analog and digital filters, and basic digital
components such as adders and comparators. Routine designs are often components of more
complex creative and variant designs.

    Within these three categories of design, there are many different types of projects. Systems
engineering and systems integration projects represent the synthesis of many subsystems into
a larger system. They may be creative or variant designs, but have unique challenges since
they are typically large and involve many people and technologies. Adherence to good design
processes is important for their success. Engineers are often engaged in systems test, where
the objective is to ensure that a system meets stated requirements and the needs of the user.
Examples include the testing of systems for use in space and military environments.

    The objective in experimental design projects is to design experimental procedures and
apparatus for determining the characteristics of a system. For example, an engineering team
may test a system under a variety of operating conditions. Example 2.4 presented later in the
chapter is such a project, where the objective was to design a series of experiments to test
the feasibility of gigabit Ethernet technology in a military environment. The test explored the
impact of environmental factors such as temperature and vibration, and further used this data
to estimate the operating lifetime of the Ethernet board. Upon completion of this project, the
team made recommendations as to the allowable operating ranges of the technology.

    The objective in analysis projects is to analyze some aspect of an existing system to improve
or correct it. For example, a system or process may be failing in the field and the source of
the failure unknown. Tools such as the Failure Mode Effects and Analysis technique may be
applied in this situation to identify the sources of failure. In technology evaluation projects,
technologies are assessed to determine if they can be used in a given application. This may be
to determine if the technology can improve an existing system, or to characterize its operating
performance.

    The objective of a research project is to perform research or experiments with the goal of
discovering or creating a new technology. The fundamental difference between this and other
types of projects is that the ultimate outcomes are unknown. Most engineering research falls
under the category of applied research. This refers to the creation of new technology or systems
2.2. SOURCES OF PROJECT IDEAS  17

based on existing technology and theory developed from fundamental research. Fundamental
research emphasizes the discovery of new scientific principles without necessarily having an
intended application. Fundamental research is very valuable, but not typically a part of design
projects.

2.2 Sources of Project Ideas

Depending upon your situation, you may have the opportunity to identify and select your
project. The list below provides some places to search for project ideas:

     Industry sponsored projects. Many companies will sponsor projects and are happy to do
       so, particularly if you have worked for them on an internship.

     Engineers without Borders (www.ewb-usa.org). This organization sponsors student projects
       to improve the quality of life in developing countries.

     www.FreeRandD.com. This is a clearinghouse for businesses and students teams to col-
       laborate on projects. It allows businesses to post capstone project ideas for students to
       work on, while students can post resumes and project interests.

     Your campus and local community. In our school, a number of student teams have
       identified novel projects by asking other departments on campus for ideas. They have
       also been successful in approaching local community organizations for ideas, such as
       museums and research institutes.

     Brainstorm. Get together with a group of your peers and brainstorm on project ideas.
       You will be surprised at how many project ideas you can develop in a good brainstorming
       session (see Chapter 4). Do not only consider project ideas, but also brainstorm to
       identify problems that need solutions.

2.3 Project Feasibility and Selection Criteria

This section provides questions to consider when examining the feasibility of a project. George
H. Heilmeier (an electrical engineer who has held positions as Chief Technology Officer of
Texas Instruments, Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and CEO of
Bellcore) developed a set of questions to answer when starting a new project [Sha94]. Heilmeier
argued that all projects must be tied to the goals of the organization, and applied this by asking
the following questions:

     What are you trying to do? Articulate your goals using absolutely no jargon.

     How is it done today, and what are the limitations of current practice?

     What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?

     Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?

     What are the risks and payoffs?

     How much will it cost? How long will it take?

     What are the midterm and final exams to check for success?
18  CHAPTER 2. PROJECT SELECTION AND NEEDS IDENTIFICATION

    Heilmeier credits successful completion of projects that he managed to answering these
questions up-front and adhering to disciplined project management processes.

    A second perspective is offered from an organizational project management viewpoint
[Gra02] that provides the following criteria for project selection:

     The project must be tied to the mission and vision of the organization. Believe it or not,
       organizations often spend resources fruitlessly on projects that don't meet this criterion.
       To be fair, there is always risk associated with a project and it is sometimes hard to
       judge exactly how well a project meets this criterion. For engineers who are new to an
       organization, it is hard to judge a project's importance relative to the mission and goals,
       but if you find yourself in this situation, do not be afraid to ask some questions. Novices
       ask basic questions that are often overlooked by those who are highly experienced or
       intimately involved in a project.

     Must have payback. An economic analysis should be done to estimate if the project will
       make a profit. Much of this is outside the scope of this text, requiring marketing and
       financial analyses. Chapter 10 covers the basics of project cost estimation that will help
       in trying to answer this question.

     Should have selection criteria. Sound criteria for selecting among competing projects
       should be employed. The example at the end of this section demonstrates the application
       of criteria in project selection.

     Objectives of the Project should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic,
       Time-Related. Chapter 3 addresses how to determine project requirements that are
       Specific and Measurable. Assignable, Realistic, and Time-Related all refer to project
       management aspects that are covered in Chapter 10. The objective is to develop tasks
       that are assigned to groups or individuals and realistically can be completed in the given
       timeframe.

    Example 2.1 demonstrates how to apply a project selection model using a method known
as the Analytical Hierarchy Process. AHP is a decision making method that is described
in Appendix B and is utilized frequently throughout the text - the reader should read
Appendix B prior to proceeding with this example.

     Example 2.1 A project selection model for capstone design.

    Assume that you are part of a capstone design team that has the opportunity to select
    their project from competing project ideas. The steps in making a decision using AHP
    are to select the criteria that drive the decision, determine relative weights of the criteria,
    rate the alternatives (in this case project concepts) against the criteria, to compute a
    weighted score for each of the alternatives, and then review the decision.

        Step 1: Determine the selection criteria
        To select the criteria, assume that the team brainstorms to determine the following
    criteria that interest the team members:

           A - Match to team skills B - Technical complexity C - Creativity D - Market
           potential E - Industry sponsorship

        Step 2: Determine the criteria weightings
2.4. NEEDS IDENTIFICATION                                                            19

    Assume the team applies the method of pairwise comparison to determine the weights
as shown in Appendix B. In order to do so, the team systematically compares each
criterion to all others using the following scale of relative importance:

    1 = equal, 3 = moderate, 5 = strong, 7 = very strong, 9 = extreme.
    Again, details of pairwise comparison are outlined in Appendix B and the results are
below.

Criteria A B C D E Weight

A      1 5 5 3 3 0.52

B      1/5 1 3 1/3 1/3 0.12

C      1/5 1/3 1 1 3                         0.09

D      1/3 3 1 1 5                           0.18

E      1/3 3 1/3 1/5 1 0.09

This is an important step and one often overlooked - the team has identified what is

important to it in project selection. It is clear that match to the team skills (criterion

A) is most important, by a large margin, followed by market potential.

Step 3: Identify and rate alternatives relative to the criteria

Assume that the team identifies three potential projects ideas: 1 - IEEE sponsored

robot competition, 2 - Industry sponsored project to design a new test protocol, and

3 - Design of an item-finder device to help people locate lost items. Furthermore, the

team goes through the process of rating each project relative to the criteria as outlined

in Appendix B. These ratings are reflected in the decision matrix in the next step.

Step 4: Compute scores for the alternatives

The decision matrix below is constructed and the scores for the alternatives deter-

mined.                     Weights                 Alternatives
      Selection Criteria
                                    Project 1 Project 2 Project 3

A (Match to skills)        0.52              0.40  0.20                 0.40

B (Technical Complexity) 0.12                0.40  0.30                 0.30

C (Creativity)             0.09              0.45  0.20                 0.35

D (Market potential)       0.18              0.05  0.35                 0.60

E (Industry sponsorship) 0.09                0.00  1.0                  0.00

Score                                        0.31  0.31                 0.38

    Step 5: Review the decision
    Project 3 (item finder) is rated the highest among the three choices based upon the
weights determined by the team members. It is a good match to the team skills, but also
matches their desire to solve a problem with good market potential. The remaining two
projects are rated about equal.

2.4 Needs Identification

Often a customer, client, or supervisor comes to you with a problem to solve and you must
determine the needs or requirements for the solution to the problem. In other words, determine
the voice of the customer. This seems like a simple statement--ask the customer what they
want and you are done, right?

    As an illustration, let's say a client comes to you with the following request--The traffic at
20  CHAPTER 2. PROJECT SELECTION AND NEEDS IDENTIFICATION

the front of campus is too congested. I would like you to design a new traffic lane for northbound
traffic exiting at the intersection at the front of the college. So you design this new lane and
have it added to the intersection. However, you find out three months later that the traffic
congestion has decreased a little bit, but it is still a significant problem. So what went wrong?
Clearly you did what was asked of you, but the problem was not solved, meaning that you
were solving the wrong problem. The real problem was to improve the flow of traffic at the
entrance. In this case, the client gave both the problem and the solution all in one statement.
That is fine if a careful feasibility study was done and it was known that the additional traffic
lane would alleviate the problem, but that was not the case here. This hypothetical situation
is not so far fetched and happens in practice via neglect to do the up-front research or because
underlying assumptions change. The point is that the correct problem should be identified and
solved.

    It would be better if the client had simply asked to improve the traffic flow, providing
the opportunity to analyze the situation and develop different design options. Some questions
to be asked in this situation are: How much additional traffic is there? At what times does
this happen? Where is the traffic coming from? What is an acceptable waiting time at the
intersection? It may be that several new lanes are needed, or perhaps the sequencing of the
traffic signals is wrong, or maybe a new entrance could be added for less cost and improved
traffic flow.

    The lesson is that customers often come with the problems and solution all wrapped up
together. When this is done, the design space, the space of all possible solutions to the
problem, is unnecessarily limited. Be ready to tactfully challenge the assumptions and ask
questions to get to the root of the problem. Ask clarifying questions, analyze, pick apart the
request, and focus on the problem, not the solution.

    Researchers and practitioners have examined the problem of eliciting needs, and it is an
important pre-requisite for developing good engineering requirements specifications. Ulrich
and Eppinger [Ulr03] proposed a process for obtaining the voice of the customer using the
following five steps: 1) Gather raw data from users; 2) Interpret raw data in terms of needs;
3) Organize needs into a hierarchy; 4) Determine the relative importance of the needs; and
5) Review the outcomes and the process. Each of these steps is described in the following
sections.

 Step 1: Gather Raw Data from Users

This is often accomplished via interviews with supervisors, key users, or people from the
client organization. In cases where new products are being developed, focus groups are often
employed. The advantage of interviews and focus groups is that they provide the opportunity
for dialogue with the user where new ideas, concepts, and needs may emerge. Another option
is direct observation, where the team goes out and examines the system in use and develops
concepts for improving it. IDEO Corporation is an innovative and successful company that
designs new products and systems. They rely heavily on direct observation as a technique for
successfully developing innovative products [Kel01]. For example, IDEO was asked by a client
to develop a new medical instrument for balloon angioplasty used in hospital operating rooms.
A critical requirement from the user was that only one hand could be used to operate the
device because the technician's other hand had to be free during the procedure. From direct
observation, the IDEO design team found that even though the current system was designed
for one-hand use, it was impractical, and the technicians actually used both hands. IDEO
designed and developed a two-handed pump that not only worked better than the one handed
2.4. NEEDS IDENTIFICATION  21

pump, but was quieter, easier to read, and had increased precision. This is another example
of the customer specifying the solution as part of the problem statement.

    Ulrich and Eppinger provide the following questions to ask during an interview:

     When and why do you use this type of product (system)?

     Walk us through a typical session using the product.

     What do you like about the existing products?

     What do you dislike about the existing products?

     What issues do you consider when purchasing the product?

     What improvements would you make to the product?

Step 2: Interpret the Raw Data in Terms of Needs

In this step the raw data is translated into customer needs. The needs are expressed in terms
of what the system must do (a requirement) as opposed to how it is done. Statements of the
customer's needs are known as marketing requirements or marketing specifications. For
example, "The system should have high-quality audio" is a need or marketing requirement from
the customer regarding performance, but says nothing about how it will be achieved. Marketing
requirements are short sentences that describe the need in the language of the customer. They
typically do not have a numerical target and are described as a state of being for the system.
Other examples of marketing requirements are, "The system should be easy-to-use," and "The
system should be able survive a drop from the runner's height."

Step 3: Organize Needs into a Hierarchy

The marketing requirements are organized into a hierarchy of needs arranged from the most
general to the most specific in successive levels of detail as required by the problem. It is
organized by functional similarity, not as hierarchy of importance (that is the next step). This
hierarchy is referred to as an objective tree. An example objective tree for a portable audio
device intended for use by runners is shown in Figure 2.1. The three high-level objectives
determined were high-quality audio, portable, and easy-to-use. Each of these is further sub-
divided into the characteristics that support the higher level. For example, portability is
divided into the needs of lightweight, small, ergonomic, and the ability to operate in the
environment. The environmental need is further expanded into needs that support it.

Step 4: Determine the Relative Importance of the Needs

The relative importance of the needs is determined based upon the user needs. As we saw in
Example 2.1 and as presented in Appendix B, the pairwise comparison is a good technique
for determining relative importance and weighting of needs. In pairwise comparison, all needs
are systematically compared to all other needs at the same level in the hierarchy. An example
pairwise comparison table for this problem is shown in Table 2.1 with the resulting weights
for each need indicated. This shows that portability is the most important need, followed by
audio quality and ease-of-use. The weights are also reflected in the objective tree in Figure 2.1.
In addition, the needs at each sublevel in the hierarchy are compared, the results of which are
reflected in Figure 2.1. The rankings are used in later chapters to compare design alternatives.

of the process.

Step 5: Review the Outcomes and the Process

The design process and all of its sub-processes are methods for making good decisions, and
this technique for needs identification is no different. There is a certain amount of subjectivity
and judgment that goes into it; the end result should be reviewed to determine if it makes
sense. The objective is to challenge assumptions, fully identify the problem, and make informed
decisions.

    The three outcomes of this process are the marketing requirements that identify the needs,
an objective tree that provides a hierarchical representation of the needs, and a ranking of the
relative importance of needs. This process may seem as though it does not apply to student

design projects, but in reality it does. The questions in this chapter are certainly candidates to
ask when working on company-sponsored projects. If it is not a company sponsored project,
the user needs should still be considered. For example, questions can be asked of friends
and co-workers who are potential users of the system, focus groups can be formed, surveys
administered, and Internet bulletin boards and discussion groups employed to gather this
information.

2.5 The Research Survey

It is important to conduct a thorough research survey while defining the project concept.
Failure to do so may translate into time and money spent reinventing the wheel, while not
taking full advantage of existing components, knowledge, practices, and technology. During
the research phase, competing systems and technologies are identified, and based upon them
the project concept refined, or in some cases abandoned. The character and strategy of the
research survey is driven by the nature of the project. In general, the objective is to develop
an understanding of the underlying scientific principles and demonstrate a familiarity with the
state-of-the-art in the particular field. Some questions to be answered in the research survey
are:

     What is the basic theory behind the concept?

     How is it currently being done?

     What are the limitations of current designs or technology?

     What are the similarities and differences between your concept and existing technologies?

     Are there existing or patented technologies that may be relevant to the design? If so,
       what are they and why are they relevant?

    Internet Searching
    The Internet is a powerful, fast, and readily accessible source for conducting research.
There are many excellent search engines for locating web resources, but understand that it is
important to go beyond the well-known search engines and beyond the Internet in the survey.
    One of the risks, and also one of the wonderful things, about the Internet is that virtually
anybody can post information. It is important to analyze websites to ensure that they are re-
liable and credible. There are resources available that provide pointers on how to evaluate this
credibility [Mci02, Sch98], and a little common sense goes a long way. One of the important
things to look for is authorship--the author should be clearly identified and any affiliations
listed. Carefully determine whether the information is subjective opinion or possibly a com-
mercial for a product. Credible sites should provide references to original sources of material.
Another step is to verify website content in print media or other reliable sources.
24  CHAPTER 2. PROJECT SELECTION AND NEEDS IDENTIFICATION

    There are thousands of search engines available, making the task of selecting one chal-
lenging. Also, there are different types of search engines: text (search for the text or key-
words; subject heading or full-page text search), indexed (information categorized into di-
rectories), meta-search (engines that search other engines), and natural language processing
(allowing natural language queries). A listing of search engines to try are www.altavista.com,
www.AskJeeves.com, www.google.com, www.kartoo.com, and www.yahoo.com. The Librar-
ian's Index to the Internet, www.lii.org is a collection selected and evaluated by librarians,
and according to their website, it is a "well-organized point of access for reliable, trustworthy,
librarian-selected Internet resources." This information may change rapidly and represents
current information at the time of publication.

2.6 Needs and Objectives Statements

Two parts of the Problem Statement are the needs and objectives statements. The needs
statement identifies and motivates the need for the project and should:

     Briefly and clearly state the need being addressed.

     Not provide a solution to the problem.

     Provide supporting information collected as outlined in Section 2.4.

     Provide any supporting statistics and anecdotes that support the need.

     Describe current limitations.

     Describe supporting processes that are needed to understand the need. This is partic-
       ularly important in industry-sponsored projects having specific needs that may not be
       clear to the average person.

    The objectives statement typically ranges from one or two sentences to one or two para-
graphs in and should:

     Summarize what is being proposed to meet the need.
26  CHAPTER 2. PROJECT SELECTION AND NEEDS IDENTIFICATION

     Provide some preliminary design objectives (detailed requirements are developed later).

     Provide a preliminary description of the technical solution, avoiding a detailed description
       of the implementation. Often the input and output behavior of the system are described.
       The complete solution is not usually posed until after the engineering requirements are
       fully determined.

    Example needs and objectives statements are provided in Examples 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.

     Example 2.2 iPod Hands-Free Device Needs and Objectives. Abstracted
    from the iPod Hands-Free Device Design Report by Al-Busaidi, Bellavia, and
    Roseborough [Alb06].

    Need: According to AppleInsider, approximately 10.3 million people owned iPods at the
    end of 2004 and many of the owners used them while operating their automobiles. The
    National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that driver distraction is a
    contributing cause of 20 to 30 percent of all motor vehicle crashes - or 1.2 million accidents
    per year. One research study has estimated that driver inattention may cause as many as
    10,000 deaths each year and approximately $40 billion in damages. iPods can present a
    distraction to drivers that is similar to cell phones in that the driver's attention is divided
    between controlling the steering wheel, watching the road, and navigating controls on the
    iPod. A system is needed to allow users to navigate among the music selections of their
    iPod without distracting their attention from the road.

        Objective: The objective of this project is to design and prototype a device that will
    make the iPod safer to use while driving an automobile, by allowing hands-free control
    of the iPod. The device will interact with the user using spoken English commands. The
    user will be able to issue simple voice commands to the device to control the operation of
    the iPod. In turn, the device will communicate information verbally, such as song titles
    that are displayed on the iPod screen, to the user.

    Example 2.3 Experimental Design Problem Needs and Objectives. Abstracted
    from the Intel Pro 1000XF Server Testing Design Report by Esek, Hunt, and
    Lewis. [Ese03].

    Need: Our industry sponsor is investigating the performance of commercial grade gigabit
    Ethernet fiber optic equipment for computer data communications in a military envi-
    ronment. The proposed system will utilize an Intel Pro1000 XF server card. This is
    a harsh operating environment and its effects on the performance and lifetime of the
    equipment are unknown. The client wishes to understand how the military environment
    affects the optical power margin of the Intel Pro 1000 XF card and associated connectors
    and cabling.

        Objective: The goal of this project is to design the experimental equipment and test
    procedures to determine the effects of temperature variations and vibration on the optical
    power margin and the operating lifespan of the system.

     Example 2.4 Portable Aerial Surveillance Needs and Objectives. Abstracted
    from the PASS Design Report by Andre, Kolb, and Thaler [And06].

    Need: Emergencies happen all across the world, all of the time. There are nearly 2,000,000
2.7. PROJECT APPLICATION: THE PROBLEM STATEMENT  27

reported fires in the United States every year, and over 90 tactical activations of Pennsyl-
vania's Special Emergency Response Team which handles barricaded suspects and hostage
situations. There have been over 100 documented riots in the United States in the past
century, with the Los Angeles Riot alone causing $1 billion in damage. Having an aerial
view of these situations would be a great benefit to the emergency workers on the ground.
For example, police may have to monitor a large crowd or a hostage situation where aerial
surveillance would allow them to observe the situation from a safe distance and use the
footage as evidence in court. Firefighters could use aerial surveillance to examine fire
damaged buildings and search for victims through the windows of high-rise buildings.
In large cities, emergency organizations often employ helicopters for aerial surveillance.
However, in smaller rural towns, helicopters either take too long to reach the scene from a
nearby city or they are too expensive to afford. The least expensive two-seat helicopters
cost over $400,000, while new helicopters cost well over a million dollars with average
operating costs of $400-$1000 per hour. There is a need for a low cost aerial device that
can provide emergency workers with overhead surveillance of emergency situations.

    Objective: The objective of this project is to design a device that will provide emer-
gency workers with a live aerial view of a situation at a cost that small municipalities can
afford. The device will deploy rapidly and record and log video. The camera will also
include pan and zoom functionality to make identification of victims and suspects easier.

2.7 Project Application: The Problem Statement

A format for a Problem Statement that integrates the elements of this chapter is as follows:

     Need. A statement that identifies the needs of the project.
     Objective. Describes the concept proposed to meet the needs identified.
     Background. A summary of the research survey on the relevant technologies and systems.

       The objective is to provide an introduction answer the questions posed in Section 2.4.
       The length and content of this section varies depending upon the project.

     Marketing Requirements. Short statements describe the user needs.
     Objective Tree. A hierarchical representation of the needs based on functional similarity

       with the relative weights of the needs identified.

2.8 Summary and Further Reading

This chapter addressed the types of projects that are often undertaken by engineers and pro-
vides guidance in terms of questions to ask when selecting a project. The success of design
projects depends upon adequately determining the user's needs and desires for the system.
A process developed by Ulrich and Eppinger for needs elicitation was presented. The three
outcomes of this process are: 1) marketing requirements identifying the customer needs, 2) an
objective tree that hierarchically represents the needs, and 3) a ranking of the relative impor-
tance of the needs. It is important to conduct research on the concept and related technologies,
and pointers for conducting the research survey were provided. Finally, a format for a Prob-
lem Statement was presented that summarizes the needs, objectives, and research survey for
a design project.
28  CHAPTER 2. PROJECT SELECTION AND NEEDS IDENTIFICATION

    The works by Griffin and Hauser [Gri93] and Ulrich and Eppinger [Ulr03] are readable and
more detailed discussions on how to obtain the voice of the customer. There are also other
design books available that address how to identify needs and develop objective trees [Cro00].
Cagan and Vogel [Cag02] have proposed a process for product development known as iNPD
(integrated new product development) and provide methods for navigating what they refer to
as "the fuzzy front end of project definition."

The Requirements Specification

       Specification  (n) A detailed and exact statement of particulars, a statement fully
       describing something to be built.--American Heritage Dictionary

    The Requirements Specification identifies those requirements that the design must satisfy in
order for it to be successful. It is in effect the mission statement that drives all subsequent stages
of development, and when completed should be a detailed and complete vision of the design
goals. An effective Requirements Specification should identify all important requirements, yet
provide enough flexibility for the design team to develop innovative solutions. It also serves as
a communication tool for everyone involved in the design, such as engineering, marketing, and
the client. All parties should agree to the requirements before further development proceeds.
In some cases, the Requirements Specification serves as a legally binding agreement between
the developers and the client.

    A major challenge in developing the requirements is in many ways analogous to the prover-
bial "What came first, the chicken or the egg? " question. The final solution is analogous to
the chicken and the requirements are analogous to the egg. In the beginning, the chicken is
hidden inside the egg, yet the egg must be capable of describing what the chicken will become.
The difficulty is that it is hard to develop the what for the requirement without already having
solved the problem or created the chicken.

    This chapter guides the reader through the process of developing a Requirements Specifica-
tion and is organized as follows. First, the properties of an engineering requirement are defined
and numerous examples for computer and electrical systems are provided. Then, the proper-
ties of the complete Requirements Specification (the collection of marketing and engineering
requirements) are considered followed by a number of case study examples. The chapter con-
cludes with advanced methods of analyzing and refining requirements, utilizing tools such as
the House of Quality.

       formed requirements that meet the properties.

     Be familiar with engineering requirements that are commonly specified in electrical and
       computer systems.

       the steps to developing one.

     Be able to conduct advanced requirements analysis to identify design tradeoffs.

3.1 Overview of the Requirements Setting Process

The Requirements Specification, which is the focus of this chapter, is a collection of engi-
neering and marketing requirements that a system must satisfy in order for it to meet the needs
of the customer or end-user. Figure 3.1 illustrates a process for developing a Requirements
Specification that is from the IEEE Guide for Developing System Requirements Specifications
[IEEE Std. 1233-1998]. This process is the focus of this chapter and there are three stakeholder
groups in it - the customer, the environment, and the technical community. The input from the
customer includes the marketing (raw) requirements that were addressed in Chapter 2. The
environment introduces requirements in the form of constraints and standards that impact or
limit the design. The input from the technical community is based upon the knowledge of
engineers who are primarily responsible for design, implementation, testing, manufacturing,
and maintenance of the system.

Figure 3.1: Requirements Specification development processes from IEEE Std. 1233-1998. The
three input sources to the process are the customer, environment, and technical community.

3.2 Engineering Requirements

Before developing the complete Requirements Specification, designers need to first determine
individual engineering requirements. Engineering requirements are short statements that
address a technical need of the design. A simple example is "The system should be able to supply
50 watts of power." This section identifies the desirable properties of engineering requirements,
methods of identifying requirements, and provides numerous examples.
3.2. ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS  33

Properties of an Engineering Requirement

Each engineering requirement should meet the four properties below [IEEE Std. 1233-1998]:

   1) Abstract. This means that a given requirement should specify what the system will
       do, not how it will be implemented. This is the chicken and egg problem described
       earlier. It is frequently the most difficult property to satisfy since designers often have
       a preconceived concept for the solution. Unless absolutely necessary, the requirements
       should say nothing about the implementation. For example, a requirement stating that
       a certain microcontroller (i.e., technology) will be used should be avoided. Admittedly,
       this is not always possible due to customer constraints or in cases where a system is
       being built upon pre-existing technology. A common analogy used for the "what versus
       how " problem is that of designing a bridge. The requirement is to transport people from
       one side to other, without specifically stating the solution is a bridge, because another
       solution, like a ferry, may be a much more effective solution.

   2) Verifiable. Verifiability means that there should be a way to measure or demonstrate
       that the requirement is met in the final system realization. Doing so allows the system
       to be tested or verified against the requirements. The idea is that if there is no way to
       verify that the requirement is met, then it should not be a requirement. Verifiability is
       used to answer the question of "Are we building the system correctly? "

   3) Unambiguous. Each requirement should have a single unambiguous meaning and be
       stated with short complete sentences.

   4) Traceable. Requirements should be traceable marketing requirements. If the design
       doesn't satisfy the customer's needs, it won't be successful.

    Let's examine an example requirement for a robot whose objective is to navigate au-
tonomously within a specified environment. Consider the following requirement

       The robot must have an average forward speed of 0.5 feet/sec, a top speed of at
       least one foot/sec, and the ability to accelerate from standstill to the average speed
       in under one second.

    Are the four properties for an engineering requirement met? In terms of the abstractness
property, the answer is yes; it states what the system must do, not how it will be implemented.
In terms of the second property, can the requirement be verified? Speed and acceleration
are directly testable in the final realization, and thus it is verifiable. Is it unambiguous? It
gives clear bounds for speed and acceleration. Finally, traceability can't be shown without the
marketing requirements and is addressed later.

    Now we analyze a second example requirement for the robot to see if it meets the properties

       The robot must employ IR sensors to sense its external environment and navigate
       autonomously with a battery life of one hour.

    This requirement is not abstract since it identifies part of the solution in terms of the
sensor type and the fact that batteries must be used. It is somewhat ambiguous in that it
should specify what is meant in terms of autonomous and the operating period. In terms of
operating period, should it work for exactly one hour and stop, or is greater than an hour
acceptable? Again, traceability can't be demonstrated without the marketing requirements.
This requirement would be hard to verify without a good definition of what autonomous
navigation in this context means. A better requirement would be
34  CHAPTER 3. THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

       The robot must navigate autonomously, with the aid of only landmarks in the spec-
       ified environment, for a period of least one hour.

    Realize that good requirements typically have two key elements in the statement - a de-
scription capability and condition. Capability describes what the system must do and in the
above requirement, that capability is autonomous navigation. Conditions are measurable or
testable attributes of the capability and are critical for verification.

A Fifth Property - Realism

In addition to meeting the four properties, requirements should be realistic or justified. This
is not defined in the IEEE standard as a property, but it is an important aspect that is
often overlooked. To be realistic, there should be a way of demonstrating that the target is
technically feasible. For example, a requirement could indicate that a robot to should travel
at a speed of 1,000,000 miles per hour, which could be verifiable, unambiguous, and abstract
- yet, completely unachievable. Realistic targets can be determined with a little research,
engineering know-how, creativity, or system modeling. One way to do this is to assume a
solution for the final system - violating the abstractness property. For example, consider the
design of a robot where some basic assumptions are made on the weight of the robot, the
motors used, the wheel size, and the battery selected. An engineering model based upon these
characteristics could be developed to predict performance and estimate realistic requirements.
Alternatively, target requirements can be based upon an actual prototype, where a model or
experimental system is developed to show that a particular requirement is feasible. This is
how the technical community in Figure 3.1 feeds into the requirements process.

    The use of benchmarking to identify similar systems and their performance provides a
reference for realistic targets. It is generally hard to surpass the performance of well-developed
products and systems on a first-generation design. An exception is with new and innovative
approaches that allow you to surpass the competition. Competitive benchmarks may also be
obtained from similar, but not necessarily identical, products. Experience working with a
particular technology or previous generations of a system also provides guidance in selecting
realistic targets. That being said, organizations wishing to gain or maintain a market edge
often press the development team to achieve performance on new generations that were once
believed to be unrealistic. Sometimes it just may not be feasible to determine the technical
feasibility of requirements. In such cases, the requirements should have a certain amount of
tolerance built into them and be updated as development proceeds.

Constraints

One of the inputs to the requirements process in Figure 3.1 is the environment, serving as the
source of both constraints and standards. In reality, all engineering requirements impose some
sort of constraint on a design, but in design a constraint is a special type of requirement. A
constraint is a design decision imposed by the environment or a stakeholder that impacts
or limits the design. Constraint requirements often violate the abstractness property. For
example, a constraint requirement is

       The system must use a PIC18F52 microcontroller to implement processing func-
       tions.

    This constraint requirement specifies how the system will be implemented. This could
be because the project sponsor has developed a great deal of expertise using this particular
3.2. ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS  35

microcontroller and does not want to spend the development time learning a new platform.
Note that a number of other references define constraints to be synonymous with non-functional
requirements (usually indicated as items that are not specifically functions). However, that
terminology is avoided here since it is not well defined nor universally accepted.

Standards

Standards are exactly what the name implies, a standard or established way of doing things
that ensure interoperability. Without standards, the use of technology would be severely
limited, if not downright impossible. Standards ensure that products work together, from
home plumbing fixtures to the modules in a modern computer. Imagine if every computer
manufacturer had their own communication standard, instead of following established protocols
such as RS-232, TCP/IP, and USB--computers would have a hard time printing, sending email,
instant messaging, or surfing the Internet! Furthermore, standards ensure the health and safety
of products that people use every day. Identifying and following standards is an expected part
of good engineering practice.

    The focus in this chapter is on identifying standards that impact the requirements and
ultimately the design. The question becomes, what standards are relevant to your project
and how do you use them? There are different levels of interaction with standards that we
denote as: user, implementation, and development levels. At the user level, the standards are
simply employed in the design, and detailed technical knowledge of the standard is typically
not necessary. For example, when using a component that communicates to other devices,
it is likely that a standard communication protocol is used. Other than having to configure
software or hardware to communicate with the standard, detailed knowledge of the standard
isn't required. Another example would be in developing software to display digital images in a
standardized format such as JPEG-2000 (Joint Photo Experts Group), in which case it is likely
that existing software components would be used to read and display data in this format.

    At the implementation level details of the standard need to be understood. Standards at the
implementation level are most likely to impact the design and the requirements. For example,
when developing low-level drivers for computer peripherals, you need to become an expert on
the underlying standard. Another example is reliability, where the requirement may be that
"the system will have a reliability of 95% in 10 years." In this case a reliability standard,
such as Military Handbook for Reliability Prediction of Equipment [MIL-HDBK 217F] may
be employed, and its usage requires an understanding of both the reliability theory and the
standard itself.

    New standards are constantly being developed and existing ones modified, leading to the
final level of interaction at the development level. Depending upon the standard, engineers
from different organizations, professional societies, and corporations take part in the standards
setting process. Many participants in this process are trying to gain a competitive advantage
for their products and services.

    It can be difficult to navigate the world of standards; they tend to be highly detailed
and limited parts of a standard may apply to a project. In addition, many standards are
costly to obtain, while some are freely distributed. The following is advice for identifying and
employing standards. First, conduct research on applicable standards. Virtually all standards
organizations maintain websites that provide basic information on their particular standards.
The IEEE Xplore database is a good place to start since it has a wide variety of standards
and provides free searchable abstracts. Many companies and universities have subscriptions
databases of complete standards. Second, determine the expected level of interaction. Based
upon your analysis of the problem, do you foresee applying standards? Or will you need to
36  CHAPTER 3. THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

develop an in-depth knowledge at the implementation level? In the latter case, you need to
obtain detailed information on the applicable standards. Finally, you should consider asking
your client. They may have their own internal standards and procedures to follow, and they
may have experts on the applicable standards.

    The list below identifies some of the types of standards that may be employed in a project
and included in the requirements.

     Safety. Safety standards address how to design for safety and how to test products to
       ensure that they are safe.

     Testing. Testing standards are often related to safety, but are broader in scope. For
       example, standardized benchmark tests are used for comparing computational perfor-
       mance, one well-known standard being the SPEC (Standard Performance Evaluation
       Corporation) benchmarks.

     Reliability. Reliability standards address general reliability principles and design methods
       for different classes of systems. Another practical aspect is in the estimation of reliability
       of electronic systems, such as the IEEE and military reliability standards.

     Communications. They address how electronic systems communicate and transfer infor-
       mation, such as in computing, telephony, and satellite communications.

     Data Formats. Standard data formats ensure that systems and software can properly
       share information. Examples include image, video, and database standards.

     Documentation. There are standards for technical report documentation. In addition,
       there are standards for documenting processes and business practices, a well-known case
       being the ISO (International Standards Organization) 9000 and subsequent standards.

     Design Methods. Certain design techniques are standardized as well. Examples include
       software design methodologies, and the use of design languages such as the Hardware
       Description Language (HDL) and the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

     Programming Languages. Programming language syntax is standardized so that software
       maintains a level of portability between systems and compilers.

     Connector Standards. Standards for cable connections are common and should be fol-
       lowed to ensure that systems are easily interfaced and manufactured.

     Meta-Standards. Some standards are a combination of multiple standards known as meta-
       standards. For example, the RS-232 standard is really a combination of a mechanical
       standard describing the connector physical dimensions connector, an electrical standard
       describing the voltages, a functional standard describing the pins and their function, and
       a procedural standard describing how entities communicate.

Identifying Engineering Requirements

There are many techniques for identifying requirements listed below [IEEE Std. 1233-1998]:

     Structured workshops and brainstorming sessions.

     Interviews, surveys, and questionnaires.

     Observation of processes or devices in use.
3.2. ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS  37

     Competitive benchmarking and market analysis.

     Prototyping and simulations.

     Research and technical documentation review.

    Many requirements may be specified for a design, but knowing which to include is the
challenge. The remainder of this section is a guide to describe the types of engineering require-
ments that may be specified for electrical and computer systems. Requirements in categories
of performance and functionality are presented first as they are often critical, followed by an
alphabetical grouping of a potpourri of other types requirements. This taxonomy of re-
quirements is by no means definitive or inclusive of all possibilities, and the design
team needs to carefully determine those that are applicable to the particular situ-
ation. Careful attention must be given to the verifiability of requirements for the
particular application.

Performance

These requirements reflect a critical aspect of the performance of the system or device. They
often are characterized by time, accuracy, throughput, or percentage error. The following is
an example requirement that might be used in a security application with camera surveillance.

       The system should detect 90% of all human faces in an image.

    In order to verify this, a test might be constructed where the system is presented with a
large database of face images that the system was not developed or trained with. The number
of faces correctly detected would then be determined. Here is another example performance
requirement for a system that measure part location

       The system should be able to measure part location to within ± 1mm.

    One way to verify this would be to take independent measurements of the system's ability
to measure part location and compare them to the result of the system. The following is an
example that could apply to software response time.

       The system should retrieve the user data no less than three seconds for 90% of
       requests and in a maximum of six seconds for all requests.

    This could be verified by constructing a test where a large number of queries for user data
are presented to the software under a variety of operating conditions and the response time
measured. Yet another example is:

       The system should be able to process video data at a rate of 30 frames per second.

    This could be verified by providing an input video stream at the frame rate and testing
to ensure that proper processing occurs. The test procedure would need to specify length
and number of videos to test, issues that are addressed in Chapter 7. A final example of
performance is one that could apply to electrical audio amplification

       The amplifier will have total harmonic distortion of less than 1%.

    Total harmonic distortion is a measure that quantifies how closely an amplifier is able to
replicate the original signal. This would likely be verified using laboratory instrumentation to
measure the harmonic distortion in the output signal.
38  CHAPTER 3. THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

Functionality
These requirements describe the type of functions that a system should perform. Often, they
provide inputs, outputs, and the transformation that the system will perform on the inputs.
This is examined further in Chapter 5, which presents functional design techniques. The
following is an example, where the input is ambient air temperature is converted to a digital
readout. It also has a performance aspect in that the accuracy is specified.

       The system will convert ambient temperature to a digital readout of temperature
       with an accuracy of 1% over the measurement range.

    The following is an example from a real capstone project to develop a wireless mouse that
is worn by the user and integrated into a glove.

       The system will implement the left and right button functions of a standard mouse.

    The following are several functional examples for software systems.

       The user shall be able to search all five company internal databases.

       The system will protect the user's identity with 128-bit encryption.

    Note that in these last two cases, verification would be by inspection.

Economic
Economic requirements include the costs associated with the development (design, production,
maintenance) and sale of a system. They may also include the economic impact of the final
system, such as how it will to contribute to profits or save the user money. Two example
economic requirements are below.

       The costs for developing the system (labor and parts) should not exceed $50,000.

       The total parts and manufacturing costs cannot exceed $500 per unit.

Energy
Virtually all systems consume and/or produce energy and thus have energy requirements.
Energy consumption is the amount of power that a system consumes, and may be specified in
terms of maximum, minimum, or average values. Example requirements are

       The system will have an average power consumption of 500mW.

       The system will have a peak current draw of 1A.

    These requirements could be verified by measuring current and voltage draws under the
different operating conditions, or by estimating the power drawn by all components in the
system.

    Operating lifetime addresses how long the system will operate from a given power source.
For battery-powered devices, operating time is critical, and the lifetime for a given source may
be an important requirement. An example of such a requirement is
3.2. ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS  39

       The system will operate for a minimum of three hours without needing to be recharged.

    Source characteristics refer to the characteristics of the input and/or output sources, such
as voltage, current, impedance, frequency, number of phases, and power requirements. An
example requirement is

       The system will operate from a 12V source that supplies a maximum current of
       300mA.

Environmental
These requirements address the impact of the design on the external environment and us-
age of the earth's resources. For example, energy usage is an important factor and example
requirement is as follows

       The system will use 20% less energy than the industry average for similar products
       and qualify for US Energy Star certification.

    Recyclability is the ability to dismantle a product into its constituent materials for reuse in
other products. European countries have regulations on the recyclability of consumer products.
In many cases, the producer of a product is responsible for its safe disposal once its service life
is over. An example requirement is as follows

       50% of the modular components will be able to be repaired and re-used in similar
       products.

Health and Safety
The health and safety of anyone affected by the final product is an especially important consid-
eration. For example, IEEE and ANSI standards provide guidance on safe levels for exposure
to radio frequency electric fields.

       The system will not expose humans to unhealthy levels of electromagnetic radiation
       and will meet conditions for safe operation identified in ANSI Std. C95.1.

    There is a tendency to think that physical harm is not an issue in electrical and computer
systems, but many electronic systems control mechanically moving parts. Consider the design
of an automatic garage door system. An example constraint could be that

       The door should stop moving if a person or object is detected in the door path.

    This could also translate into further engineering requirements on the amount of force on
the door required to trigger it to stop. There are many safety standards, and two that are
widely applied for consumer products are the UL (Underwriters Laboratory) and CE (Common
European) standards. Examples are

       The system will use only UL approved components.

       The final system will be meet UL and CE standards and be tested at an independent
       laboratory for approval.
40  CHAPTER 3. THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

Legal

Designs should not infringe upon existing patents, copyrights, and trademarks, particularly if
the intention is to sell the product. Patent searches should be conducted, and search capabilities
are available at the United States Patent Office website (www.uspto.gov). An example is

       An intellectual property search will be conducted to ensure that there is no infringe-
       ment on prior patents.

       This could be verified by having an external firm will conduct the patent search
       and evaluate the design against existing intellectual property.

    Security and privacy constraints apply to systems that handle sensitive data or personal
communications. The ability of computing systems to withstand malicious attacks by hackers is
another consideration, and the use of firewalls or other protective measures may be warranted.
Examples are

       The system will protect the user's identity with 128-bit encryption as required by
       law.

Maintainability

The maintenance of the system being developed and compatibility with other systems are often
considerations. Will the system be designed so that it can be reused in future applications?
This is common in software development where the objective is to design modules that are
reliable and flexible enough to be used in other applications. It is also a consideration in terms
of the reusability of electronic or digital components in future system upgrades. An example
reuse constraint is

       The software should maintain downward capability and be able to use version 2
       object libraries.

    After a product goes into service, it enters the maintenance phase, where it is maintained
and upgraded. In software designs this is an important consideration, as software is regularly
upgraded and maintained. On the hardware side, maintenance can be facilitated by the use of
plug-in modules that are easily removed and replaced. Examples are

       The system will initially be available to 100 users at five field locations, and within
       one year must be expanded to address usage by 5,000 users company-wide.

       The system should have a modular design such that failed components can be re-
       placed by a technician in under 15 minutes.

    There may be internal restrictions on system development imposed by the company based
on their internal expertise and ability to maintain the system, such as the following constraint
requirement.

       The system will use only PIC microcontrollers.
3.2. ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS  41

Manufacturability

A prevalent product development paradigm that used to be employed in many engineering
organizations was to "throw the design over the wall." What this meant is that the design and
development team would create a new product and hand it off to the manufacturing team to
produce (throw it over the wall and run), often without having considered the manufacturability
of the product. The manufacturing team would then address how to produce the design, and
in many cases could not do so without major redesign. Fortunately, this has given way to
much better concurrent engineering practices where all aspects of product development are
considered throughout the process. All of the examples presented here are constraints, in that
that they are external decisions that limit the design.

    Size is a consideration in terms of the amount of space the final design will occupy, par-
ticularly if it has to be physically integrated with other components. An example constraint
requirement is

       The system must be manufactured on a circuit board with dimensions of no greater
       than 1"x2".

    The realization and portability of the system is a consideration. For example, with electron-
ics, will it be built on a printed circuit board? Following design rules and file format guidelines
is important for manufacturing printed circuit boards and integrated circuits. A chip foundry
may require that integrated circuit layouts utilize certain file formats. Examples are below,
which again are clear constraints on the design.

       The system will be manufactured using three layer printed circuit board technology.

       The product should be run on the Linux operating system.

    The use of readily available parts, instead of low volume or hard to find components,
improves manufacturability, and an example is

       The design shall only incorporate components that can be purchased through two of
       our main suppliers.

Operational

Operational requirements address the physical environment in which the system will oper-
ate. Characteristics could be temperature, humidity, electromagnetic radiation, shock, and
vibration. Note, that these can often be quite difficult to verify and may require specialized
equipment to do so. An example temperature operational requirement is

       The system should be able to operate in the temperature range of 0°C to 75°C.

    This could be tested via test in an environmental chamber which the operation of the
system is tested over the complete temperature range. Alternatively, indirect verification
is a possibility. For example, in the design, only components that are known to meet this
operational requirement, as specified in their product datasheet, could be used.

    Depending upon the customer needs, the system may be tested in an environmental chamber
to verify that the requirement is met. Humidity is similar in concept to the temperature
requirement, addressing the required ambient humidity range. A system may also need to
be water-resistant (withstand rain and snow) or waterproof (be submersible in water). An
example requirement is
42  CHAPTER 3. THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

       The system must be waterproof and operate while submersed in water.

    Be careful with the differences between waterproof (submersible in water) and water-
resistant, which indicates the ability to withstand outdoor elements such as rain and snow.
For example, outdoor decorative lights are water-resistant, but not waterproof.

    Depending upon the environment, the system may need to withstand vibrations. Bounds
are typically specified in terms of frequency, magnitude, and duration of the vibration. An
example requirement is

       The system must be able to withstand vibrations of up to 60Hz with a peak magnitude
       of 1mm for a period of 1 minute.

    Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) results from any electromagnetic energy that interferes
or disturbs the operation of an electronic system. Electronic systems may produce electromag-
netic radiation and limits may need to be placed upon the amount of radiation emitted. EMI
is typically measured with specialized testing apparatus. Conversely, a system may need to be
able to operate properly given a certain level of EMI.

    The system may need to withstand a specified amount of shock and still operate. This may
be measured in G-force or via heuristics. An example requirement is

       The system should withstand a drop from a height of six feet and still operate.

Political

Political constraints address relationships to political, governmental, or union organizations.
Examples include obtaining governmental approvals, resolving trade barriers, and determining
the acceptance of systems for use in unionized environments. Examples are below.

       The system will need to obtain FDA approval before it can be sold to medical users.

       The software will comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

Reliability and Availability

This refers to the expected period of time that a system will operate properly. Measures of
reliability include failure rates and mean time to failure. Estimation of system reliability is
given detailed coverage in Chapter 8. The following is an example of a reliability requirement.

       The system will have a reliability of 95% in five years.

    This requirement means that 95% of the systems should be properly operating (have not
failed) in five years. Direct measurement of reliability would not be possible, unless you are
willing to wait five years to see how many systems fail, thus the use of estimation. This would
require indirect verification using mathematical techniques to estimate the system reliability.

    Availability is related to reliability, but addresses the amount of time that a system is
available for operation. Example availability requirements are

       The system will be operational 99% of the time.

       The system will be operational from 4AM to 10PM, 365 days a year.
3.2. ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS  43

    These might be hard to verify this since it is only determined for sure once the system
is deployed. Verification would have to address under which conditions the system would be
tested to ensure this occurs.

Social and Cultural

This addresses aspects such as benefits, risks, and acceptance of products by the intended user
or by society at large. For example, robots have tremendous benefits for improving product
quality, while freeing people from dangerous and repetitive tasks. Yet when used in automation,
they present the risk of displacing workers and causing job losses.

    Many great products have fallen by the wayside because users were unwilling to accept
it. An example is the early Apple Newton Personal Digital Assistant, the first product of its
kind. The fatal flaw was handwriting recognition that required a training process for accurate

recognition. This was not accepted by consumers and Palm® Computing solved the problem

by employing a simplified alphabet known as Graffiti. Graffiti was also seen as risky when it
was being developed, but due to its simplicity it was accepted by consumers and the product
became a huge success. In the mid 1980s, Phillips electronics released the Laser Disk player,
which failed magnificently, but was far superior to VHS technology. Their failure was attributed
to the cost of the players and disks when compared to VHS. Fifteen years later DVDs, with
the help of computers, reached a price point which now makes them preferable to VHS.

    Will the system be used by engineers, technicians, laborers, doctors, lawyers, or the general
public? Each group has its own culture, educational background, and willingness to accept
innovations. Example requirements are

       The product shall provide help menus to the user in either English or Spanish.

       The software will be designed to easily be used by operators on the manufactur-
       ing floor. The software will be tested by a group of 25 operators and the average
       time to learn the basic functionality of the software will not exceed 8 hours.

Usability
Usability requirements address the ease of use of a system. Although they are quite common,
they are often difficult to verify. Usability can address how long it takes to learn the product
and satisfaction by the end-user or a group of users. To aid in verification conditions can be
placed on the number of menus in the system, an estimated learning time, and number and
types of errors the user is allowed to make. An example requirement is that

       Users of the system should be able to learn 80% of its functionality within two hours.

    The method of verification would need to be clearly specified, such as, a group of 25 test
users who have never used the product will be provided two hours to learn the product. Another
example of a usability requirement is

       The system will have a maximum of 20 functions and a maximum of two menus of
       depth.
44  CHAPTER 3. THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

3.3 Developing the Requirements Specification

The Requirements Specification is the complete set of all system requirements. The steps in
developing the Requirements Specification are to:

     Identify requirements from the customer, environment, and the technical community
       (focus of the previous section).

     Ensure the engineering requirements are well-formed (meet the properties).

     Organize the requirements. Similar requirements should be presented together and rela-
       tionships between engineering and marketing requirements identified. The collection of
       requirements should meet the properties identified in this section.

     Validate the Requirements Specification - which means all requirements are examined to
       ensure they meet the needs of the stakeholders.

Properties of the Requirements Specification

The desirable properties of the Requirements Specification are as follows [IEEE Std.1233-1998]:

   1) Normalized (orthogonal) set. There should be no overlap or redundancy between engi-
       neering requirements. A mathematical analogy is that of orthogonal vectors. For ex-
       ample, the x and y axes of the two-dimensional Cartesian space are orthogonal vectors,
       meaning that the projection (dot product) of one vector onto the other is zero. Ideally,
       all requirements should be orthogonal with no redundancy.

   2) Complete set. A complete Requirements Specification addresses all of the needs of the
       end-user and also those needs required for system implementation. Failure to define a
       complete set results in under-specificity where not all needs are met.

   3) Consistent. The engineering requirements should not be self-contradictory.

   4) Bounded. The scope of the Requirements Specification should be identified. Determine
       the minimum acceptable bound for target values; going beyond what is necessary limits
       the design space of potential solutions. Applying unnecessary bounds results in over-
       specificity.

   5) Modifiable. Requirements are typically considered to be evolutionary. This is because
       there are many unknowns at the start of a project, hence estimates for the requirements
       are made. The original requirements are known as baseline requirements. The esti-
       mates can change as development proceeds, as long as the changes are communicated to
       and agreed upon by all affected parties. Versions of the requirements should be tracked
       and identified as modifications take place.

Requirements Validation

An important property of an engineering requirement that we saw earlier was verifiability.
Verifiability seeks to answer the question of whether or not the system is being developed
correctly, or "Are we building the product correctly?" A related concept is that of validation,
which seeks to answer the question "Are we building the correct product? " More formally,
validation is the process of determining whether the system meets the needs of the user--is it
3.4. REQUIREMENTS CASE STUDIES                                                          45

valid? This is more general in scope than verification and more difficult to show. Requirements
validation is usually carried out by reviews of the requirements by a team of people. Validation
is demonstrated by being able to answer the following questions in the affirmative [Som01]:

     For each individual engineering requirement, are the traceability and verifiability prop-
       erties met? Is each requirement realistic and technically feasible?

     For the Requirements Specification, are the properties of orthogonality, completeness,
       and consistency met?

    A complete Requirements Specification includes all the requirements, both marketing and
engineering, along with the relationships between them. The relationships between the en-
gineering and marketing requirements need to be described to ensure that all the marketing
requirements are being addressed by design. The relationship between the marketing and en-
gineering requirements is called a mapping because, like a mathematical mapping, it defines
which elements of the domain (marketing requirements) are associated with which elements of
the range (engineering requirements).

3.4 Requirements Case Studies

This section presents case study examples of Requirements Specification, most of which are
from real capstone design projects. They are presented in a table format that presents each en-
gineering requirement, the mapped marketing requirements (supporting the traceability prop-
erty), and the justification for each requirement. The marketing requirements are summarized
at the end of the table.

Case Study: Car Audio Amplifier

Table 3.1 presents the Requirements Specification for a car audio amplifier. This simple ex-
ample was selected because of the relative ease of understanding, broad familiarity with this
type of device, and it will be expanded upon later.

Marketing Requirements
1. The system should have excellent sound quality.
2. The system should have high output power.
3. The system should be easy to install.
4. The system should have low cost.

    Audio power amplifiers are widely available devices, so the requirements were determined
through competitive benchmarks and knowledge of amplifier circuit designs. The first engi-
neering requirement directly impacts sound quality and is known as total harmonic distortion
(THD). THD measures how closely the amplifier output signal follows the input signal. It
is desirable for an amplifier to have a linear relation between input and output, where the
output signal is identical to the input signal, except for an amplification factor. In reality, all
amplifiers have some degree of nonlinearity or distortion. It is measured by applying a pure
sinusoid as the input to the amplifier, which in the case of a perfectly linear amplifier produces
a pure output sinusoid of the same frequency. Any nonlinearity introduces unwanted harmonic
frequencies. THD represents the power of unwanted harmonics relative to the power of the
fundamental sinusoid. THD is typically less than 1% for a good amplifier.

    The second requirement, output power, is quantified in terms of both average and maximum
values to minimize ambiguity. The third engineering requirement addresses the efficiency of the
power transfer, or how much of the power consumed by the device is actually converted to audio
power. The fourth engineering requirement, ease of installation, is perhaps easy to understand
intuitively, and the expected installation time provides the condition for verification. The fifth
requirement addresses the physical size of the device, and is important as it will need to be
installed somewhere in the vehicle.

    To develop the marketing requirements, this team conducted an informal survey of students
on campus, asking the target group what their desires for such a system would be. The first
three engineering requirements are related to the important issues of the system functionality
and performance. In order to develop justifications for some of the requirements a prototype
solution had to considered, although the solution has not been formally posed. For example,
in order to estimate a time for responding to a user's command, some assumptions were made

on the types of components that might be used in the design. The last two requirements are
operational requirements, ensuring that the device will work in its intended environment.

Case Study: Gigabit Ethernet Card Testing

Table 3.3 presents an example Requirements Specification developed for the design of an ex-
perimental test setup [Ese03]. The Problem Statement for this example was presented in
Chapter 2, where the objective was to design a system to test a gigabit Ethernet card for
use in a harsh operating environment. In particular, the effects of temperature and vibration
variations on the optical power margin, both of which impact the bit-error rate and the system
performance, were determined.

    The marketing requirements were quite brief and direct, and not surprising due to the fact
the customer in this case was group of engineers who had a good idea of what they wanted.
The engineering requirements were selected based upon characteristics of the operating en-
vironment, through discussion with the engineers, and via some educated guesswork. Let's
consider some of the requirements, starting with the effects of temperature variation on the
optical power output. The testing requirement on the temperature range was selected based
on the operating environment, while the accuracy is driven by the test equipment. The re-
quirements also address the vibration testing requirements, including the vibration frequency
range, amplitude, and resonant frequency.

    This project was developed in conjunction with Penn State Behrend and the Mercyhurst
College's Institute for Intelligence Studies to meet a need that the institute identified. The
student team met with a number of law enforcement officials to determine the needs. The
first engineering requirement addresses the critical functionality that the system is to provide,
while engineering requirements 2-5 address the performance and ability to work in the outdoor
environment. Note the inclusion of a federal standard that drives the requirement on the
maximum deployment height of the device. Requirement 7 addresses the cost, which can often
be difficult to justify in student projects, but in this case the team has developed a clear
justification.

3.5 Advanced Requirements Analysis

This section examines more advanced methods that are used to analyze and refine requirements.
There are tradeoffs between the different requirements and understanding them is valuable for
refining the requirements themselves and developing solution concepts. This section addresses
tradeoffs between engineering and marketing requirements, tradeoffs between engineering re-
quirements themselves, and benchmarking. At the conclusion, all of this is integrated in to the
well-known House of Quality.

The Engineering-Marketing Tradeoff Matrix

This matrix identifies how engineering and marketing requirements impact each other. To
demonstrate its construction, we continue to examine the automobile audio amplifier example
from Table 3.1. The tradeoff matrix is shown in Table 3.5, where the marketing requirements
constitute the row headings and the engineering requirements the column headings.

tion, ^^=strong positive correlation, _=negative correlation, __=strong negative correlation.

3) Install Ease +  _                 ^^ ^ _

4) Cost  - __ _ _                    _ ^^

    One of the first things to note is that each requirement has an associated polarity. A
requirement with a positive/negative polarity, denoted with a +/- symbol, means that in-
creasing/decreasing that requirement increases the desirability of the product, respectively. A
goal is considered a requirement with its polarity. For example, cost almost universally has a
negative polarity because decreasing cost almost always makes a product more desirable.

    The entries in the body of the matrix can be thought of as a correlation that measures the
ability to achieve the marketing and engineering goals simultaneously. A positive correlation (^)
means that both goals can be simultaneously improved, while a negative correlation (_) means
that improving one will compromise the other. Not all correlations are of equal importance,
the strength of the correlation being denoted by the number of arrows. Blanks entries in the
matrix mean that there is no correlation between the requirements.

    To better understand the matrix, consider the entries in the top row associated with sound
quality. The relationship between THD and sound quality is denoted by the double positive
arrow. This relationship is interpreted as

       The goal is to increase sound quality and decrease THD. There is a strong positive
       correlation between them since decreasing THD increases sound quality.

    What wasn't so clear in the 1-to-1 mapping is that there is a link between the goal of
maximizing output power and the goal of maximizing sound quality (second entry in the top
row). This entry is interpreted as

       The goal is to increase sound quality, to increase output power, and there is negative
       correlation between them since increasing output power will decrease sound quality.

    That is because electronics can be designed to achieve larger output power at the expense
of sound quality. However, it gets a little more complicated, since output power can be in-
creased without loss in sound quality, if more amplifier stages are employed. That increases
the dimensions and cost, thus the relationships between sound quality, cost, and dimensions
52        CHAPTER 3. THE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

are identified in the first row. When creating the entries in the matrix, it should be assumed
that only the associated requirements can vary and that all others are held constant. When
finished, the matrix allows a quick and easy reading of the tradeoffs between engineering and
marketing requirements. This example demonstrates the complex nature of a seemingly simple
device, and provides a much clearer picture of the design tradeoffs involved.

The Engineering Tradeoff Matrix

The example of output power in the previous section illustrates the need to examine the
tradeoffs between the engineering requirements, which are shown in Table 3.6. In this table
the engineering requirements constitute the headings for both the row and column entries.
Only the entries above the upper diagonal elements are filled in due to the redundancy of the
lower diagonal elements. Again, positive and negative correlations are indicated along with
the strength of correlation.

    Let's examine the tradeoffs involved with output power. High output power can be achieved
at the expense of THD as shown in the first row of the table. The second row indicates that
there is a positive correlation between efficiency and output power, since the more efficient
an amplifier is, the more power it can deliver. There is a negative correlation between the
dimensions and power, since larger parts and greater surface area aid in dissipating more
power. Finally, there is a negative correlation between the output power and cost because of
the greater size and number of parts needed to achieve higher power.

Competitive Benchmarks

Competitive benchmarking helps to select targets for the engineering requirements. By ana-
lyzing competing systems, a better understanding is gained of what is realistic and where the
design may potentially outperform the competition. The benchmark table lists the require-
ments in the row headings and the competitors in the column headings as shown in Table 3.7.

The House of Quality

A well-known tool for developing requirements is the House of Quality (HOQ). The HOQ is
part of a product development process known as Quality Functional Deployment (QFD) that is

widely used in industry. QFD is a series of processes for product development that incorporate
the needs of the customer throughout the system lifecycle. It encompasses design, manufac-
turing, sales, and marketing. QFD is characterized by a series of matrices that have a visual
appearance similar to that of a house. The matrices relate different aspects of the development
process and are effective for communicating between different units in an organization. There
are houses for different phases of product development, but here the focus is on using the
HOQ for the Requirements Specification. A HOQ for the audio amplifier example is shown in
Figure 3.2.

gineering requirements, engineering-marketing tradeoffs, engineering tradeoffs, and the target
values for the engineering requirements. The HOQ is presented for completeness, but is re-
dundant since it contains all of the information already presented in Tables 3.5-3.7. The HOQ
also becomes visually overwhelming and hard to read as problem complexity grows.

3.7 Summary and Further Reading

This chapter presented a process for developing the Requirements Specification, which consists
of identifying the requirements from the user, environment, and input of the technical com-
munity. The desirable properties of engineering requirements and the complete Requirements
Specification were presented. The verification of a requirement is particularly important, as
it seeks to help in answering if the system is being built correctly. Requirements validation
addresses whether the requirements meet the needs of the user, or if the correct product is be-
ing designed. Tools for benchmarking and analyzing the tradeoffs between requirements were
given. Proper determination of the requirements significantly influences all subsequent phases
of the design, thus the final requirements document should be agreed upon by all stakeholders.

    The processes presented here were developed from research in the field and the authors'
teaching experiences. Pugh [Pug90] presents a good perspective on identifying requirements

and constraints, although with more emphasis on mechanical systems. The article by Robert
Abler [Abl91] is a short primer that provides good advice on how to develop specifications that
overlaps with the properties presented in the IEEE Standard 1233 [IEEE Std. 1233-1998].

    The HOQ technique was originally developed by Hauser and Clausing [Hau88] and has
gained wide acceptance. Their original article provides a case study of the technique applied
to the design of automobile door seals as implemented by Toyota Motor Corporation. Ullrich
and Eppinger [Ull03] present a good perspective on developing specifications employing the
QFD techniques and the HOQ with an emphasis on the voice of the customer.

Concept Generation and Evaluation

       Creativity is a great motivator because it makes people interested in what they are
       doing. Creativity gives hope that there can be a worthwhile idea. Creativity gives
       the possibility of some sort of achievement to everyone. Creativity makes life more
       fun and more interesting.--Edward DeBono

    When developing a design, it is important to explore many potential solutions and select the
best one from them. Too often a single concept is generated and is the only one pursued, the
unfortunate result being that potentially better solutions are not considered. When confronted
with a problem, engineers must explore different concepts, critically evaluate them, and be
able to defend the decisions that led to a particular solution. Two key thought processes
employed are creativity and judgment. Creativity involves the generation of novel concepts,
while judgment is applied to evaluate and select the best solution for the problem. Creativity
and judgment appear to be inherent individual qualities that can't be taught. That is to some
extent true, but with practice and application of formal techniques, they can be improved.

    It is important to distinguish between innovation and creativity. Creativity refers to the
ability to develop new ideas, while innovation is the ability to bring creative ideas to reality.
Innovation is valued by companies since new products and services are often their lifeblood.
That is why many make it a priority to hire engineers who can bring creativity to the design
process. This chapter addresses creativity, concept generation, and evaluation in design. The
first part describes barriers to creative thought, followed by strategies for overcoming them
and enhancing creativity. Next, methods for concept generation are presented, followed by
techniques for concept evaluation.

4.1 Creativity

Is creativity something that is inherent in the individual or something that can be learned?
It appears that both are true; some individuals are naturally more creative than others, yet
people can enhance their creativity with conscious effort and practice. This section examines
barriers to creativity, different thinking modes, and strategies for enhancing creativity. One of
the ways to spark creativity is to solve puzzles. To get into the creative spirit the reader can
try to solve the puzzles presented in Figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1: (a) The shovel problem. Think of this as a shovel with a coin on the spade. The
objective is to move two lines so that the coin is no longer in the spade, but there is still a
shovel. (b) The nine dot problem. Draw four connected straight lines that pass through all
nine dots.

Barriers to Creativity

James L. Adams, an engineer and former professor at Stanford University, has researched in-
novation in technical domains. He examined the barriers to creativity and classified them into
the following four types: 1) perceptual blocks, 2) emotional blocks, 3) cultural and environ-
mental blocks, and 4) intellectual and expressive blocks [Ada01].

    Perceptual blocks are those that prevent people from clearly seeing the problem for what
it is. A common perceptual block is the tendency to delimit the problem space, or in other
words, to put constraints on the problem that don't exist. Have you solved the puzzles shown
in Figure 4.1 yet? If not, it is possible that you are placing constraints on the problems that
don't exist. Knowing that this is the case, you may want to go back and try again. Another
example of a perceptual block is the tendency to stereotype or see a solution to a problem
that one is biased to see. This occurs because we have used similar techniques for solving
the problem in the past. For example, if you have used a microcontroller to solve a certain
type of problem, chances are that you are going to consider using a microcontroller in all
related problems in the future. Another perceptual block is the difficulty of isolating the true
problem. Three pictures that illustrate this are shown in Figure 4.2. When examining these
images, people tend to form a conclusion as to what the content of each one is. Look carefully,
as each picture has two equally valid interpretations.

    One of the most common emotional blocks is the fear of failure. People often have creative
ideas, but are afraid to express them since they may be criticized or may not have the "correct"
answer. It is clich´e to hear that you must fail often to succeed, but true. The highly successful
4.1. CREATIVITY  59

Figure 4.2: Each of the images shown above has two different interpretations. Can you deter-
mine what they are?

product design company, IDEO, that was examined in Chapter 2 takes the approach in concept
generation to "fail early and often" in order to succeed [Kel01]. Their design teams are en-
couraged to develop many seemingly outlandish ideas that are often discarded, but sometimes
lead to innovative solutions. Another emotional block is a fear of chaos and disorganization.
The creative process challenges engineers, since it is disorganized and not a neat scientific
approach to which they are accustomed. Another block is the tendency to critically judge
ideas, rather than generate and build upon them. Finally, it takes time for creative ideas
to incubate. Most of us can relate to the experience when we could not solve a problem that
nagged us for a period of time, followed by that unexpected "Aha!" moment when we identified
the solution.

    Environmental blocks refer to those things in our environment that limit creative ability.
This could be in the form of poor teamwork where members distrust each other and criticize
each other's ideas. In the workplace, this could be due to autocratic management that resists
new ideas. There are also cultural biases against creativity. There is a bias against creativity
as an approach to problem solving in the engineering field. This is usually based upon the
reasoning that there is a single correct solution to a problem and creativity is an excuse for
poor engineering. It is true that creativity and brainstorming alone do not solve engineering
problems--the concepts generated need to be scrutinized using engineering principles to become
viable innovations.

    The final block that Adams identified is that of intellectual and expressive. In an engineering
context, this means that the designer needs to have an understanding of intellectual tools that
are applied to solve problems. For example, mathematics is a universal language for expressing
and solving scientific problems. Specific examples in ECE are languages that describe the
characteristics of systems such as functional, logical, and state behaviors. Examples in digital
design are truth tables (input, output behavior) and state diagrams (stimulus-response). In the
domain of electronics design, a functional approach (input, output, and function) is commonly
used. Chapters 5 and 6 present tools for modeling the behavior of ECE systems.

Vertical and Lateral Thinking

Edward DeBono is the father of a field known as lateral thinking, which offers a different
perspective on the barriers to creativity. Lateral thinking is contrasted to what is known as
60  CHAPTER 4. CONCEPT GENERATION AND EVALUATION

the vertical thinking process [Deb67, Deb70]. Engineers tend to be vertical (or convergent)
thinkers, meaning that they are good at taking a problem and proceeding logically to the
solution. This is typically a sequential linear process, where the engineer starts at the highest
level and successively refines elements of the design to solve the problem. This is usually based
upon experience solving similar problems and conventional tools that are employed in that
particular area.

    The objective of lateral (or divergent) thinking is to identify creative solutions. It is not
concerned with developing the solution for the problem, or right or wrong solutions. It en-
courages jumping around between ideas. In the words of DeBono "The vertical thinker says:
'I know what I am looking for.' The lateral thinker says: 'I am looking but I won't know
what I am looking for until I have found it.' " The field of lateral thinking is character-
ized by puzzles of the following type found at Paul Sloane's Lateral Thinking Puzzles website
[http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/sloane]:

       A body is discovered in a park in Chicago in the middle of summer. It has a frac-
       tured skull and many other broken bones, but the cause of death was hypothermia.

    A hunter aimed his gun carefully and fired. Seconds later, he realized his mistake.
    Minutes later, he was dead.

       A man is returning from Switzerland by train. If he had been in a non-smoking car
       he would have died.

    The objective in these puzzles is to develop plausible scenarios that explain how each of
the above situations could have happened. A solution for the first example is that a person
stowed away in the wheel compartment of a jet airliner. While in flight he froze and died of
hypothermia. When the plane prepared to land, it lowered its landing gear, causing the body
to fall to the park, fracturing his skull, and breaking his bones. Can you develop plausible
scenarios that describe each of them?

    Vertical thinking focuses on sequential steps toward a solution and tries to determine the
correctness of the solution throughout the process. This is very different from lateral thinking
where there is nonlinear jumping around between steps and there is no attempt to discern
between right and wrong. As such, lateral thinking is more apt to follow least likely paths to a
solution, whereas vertical thinking follows the most likely paths. The goal in lateral thinking
is to develop as many solutions as possible, while vertical thinking tries to narrow to a single
solution.

    Lateral thinking is appropriate for the concept generation phase. So should concept gen-
eration and brainstorming be done by the individual or by a team? DeBono and Osborn [Osb63]
conclude that creativity is more effective by individuals than by teams. However, Osborn also
points out that there is great value in applying creativity in teams, since it provides a place for
the team to work together on problems and see other perspectives. Our anecdotal observations
of student design teams supports this--group brainstorming is effective for developing concepts,
new product ideas, new features, and different ways to combine technologies. This is because
in groups, ideas are readily built upon by other team members. More mathematical, technical,
and theoretical breakthroughs tend to be the work of the lone genius. Examples of this are
the Theory of Relativity (Einstein), Boolean Logic (Bool), and Shannon's Sampling Theorem.
4.1. CREATIVITY  61

We have also observed that novice designers, who do not have much experience in concept
generation, can benefit greatly from group brainstorming techniques.

Strategies to Enhance Creativity

There are valuable strategies that can be employed to enhance the creative process. The body
of research on the subject is very large and key points are summarized as follows:

     Have a questioning attitude. One of the keys is to have a questioning attitude and chal-
       lenge assumptions. The willingness to do this generally decreases as people age. Young
       children are highly creative and are constantly questioning everything, with questions
       such as "Why do trees have leaves? " or "Why is the sky blue? " Asking basic questions
       stimulates creativity and is applicable to technical designs. When examining a design
       with a microcontroller, ask questions such as "Is there a way to replace the microcon-
       troller? ", "Are there other features that I can achieve with the microcontroller? ", and
       "Is there a better microcontroller that can be used? "

     Practice being creative. Research shows that people can improve their creative ability
       through conscious effort. For example, try solving the puzzles presented in this chapter
       and in the end of the chapter problems. Be conscious of things that bother you ("pet
       peeves") in your everyday life and try to develop new solutions for them.

     Suspend judgment. It is easy to criticize and immediately dismiss ideas, so it is impor-
       tant to defer judgment and be flexible in thinking. Seemingly outlandish ideas can
       lead to other concepts that are valuable solutions. The opportunity for new solutions
       is curtailed if ideas are immediately judged and discarded. Creative concepts can be
       developed by taking a concept and modifying it or combining it with other seemingly
       unrelated concepts.

     Allow time. The creative process needs time for incubation. The human mind needs
       time to work on problems, so set aside time to reflect on the problem and to allow it to
       incubate so that the "Aha! " moment of discovery can happen.

     Think like a beginner. New solutions often come from novices. The reason is that
       novices don't have preconceived ideas as to the solution for a problem. Experience is
       a double-edged sword--it allows one to quickly solve problems by drawing upon pre-
       existing solutions, but can inhibit creativity. If confronted with a new problem that
       bears similarity to one encountered in the past, then it is likely that the new solution
       will bear similarity to the old one. If everyone else is it doing it one way, consider the
       opposite.

    Many creative ideas arise from novel combinations and adaptations of existing technology.
SCAMPER, an acronym for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate,
and Rearrange/Reverse, can be used as a guide to systematically generate creative concepts.
The SCAMPER principles are valuable in brainstorming and are described below:

     Substitute. Can new elements be substituted for those that already exist in the system?

     Combine. Can existing entities be combined in a novel way that has not been done
       before?

     Adapt. Can parts of the whole be adapted to operate differently?
62  CHAPTER 4. CONCEPT GENERATION AND EVALUATION

     Modify. Can part or all of a system be modified? For example, size, shape, or functional-
       ity.

     Put to other use. Are there other application domains where the product or system can
       be put to use?

     Eliminate. Can parts of the whole be eliminated? Or should the whole itself be elimi-
       nated?

     Rearrange or Reverse. Can elements of the system be rearranged differently to work
       better? This is different from substituting in that the elements of the system are not
       changed, but rearranged or ordered differently to create something new. In terms of
       reversal, are there any roles or objectives that can be reversed?

    SCAMPER is a modification of a set of questions that was originally posed by Osborn
[Osb63] and was modified to its form above by Michalko [Mic91].

4.2 Concept Generation

After the problem is defined, the next step is to explore concepts for the solution. It is unlikely
that a design team will have reached this stage without some ideas for solving the problem,
but it is important to fully explore the design space. Ullrich and Eppinger [Ull03] identify the
following phases of concept generation - search internally, search externally, and systematically
explore. Each is considered in turn.

    External searching was covered to a great extent in Chapters 2 and 3, which addressed
conducting background research and benchmarking. Methods of external searching are:

     Conduct literature search.

     Search and review existing patents.

     Benchmark similar products.

     Interview experts.

    Internal searching is done by the team members via methods such as brainstorming. The
team members need have to have a common problem definition for this to be effective. Un-
derstanding the tradeoffs using requirement analysis methods in Chapter 3 is also valuable, as
overcoming tradeoffs leads to innovative solutions. Furthermore, the team should decompose
larger problems into sub-problems and the attack the sub-problems individually. Chapter 5
addresses the process of problem decomposition.

    The most well-known method of internal searching is brainstorming. Group brainstorm-
ing is effective for generating many concepts in a short period of time. Experienced design
teams are known to generate hundreds of concepts in an hour. Traditional brainstorming is
not highly-structured--though a facilitator helps--and employs five basic rules:

     No criticism or judgment of ideas.

     Wild ideas are encouraged.

     Quantity is stressed over quality.

     Build upon and modify the ideas of others.
4.2. CONCEPT GENERATION  63

     All ideas are recorded.

    Many novice design teams struggle with unstructured brainstorming and more formalized
approaches, such as brainwriting and the Nominal Group Technique, can be of benefit. The
steps of brainwriting are:

   1. The team develops a common problem statement that is read out loud.

   2. Each team member writes their ideas down on a card and places it in the center of the
       table.

   3. Other team members then take cards from the pile and use other's ideas to generate new
       ones or build upon them, keeping in mind the principles of SCAMPER. Alternatively,
       members can each generate an idea, write it on a card, and then pass it to another team
       member. Each member then builds upon the idea passed to them.

    Brainwriting 6-3-5 is a variation where the objective is to have six people, develop three
ideas in five minutes. The optimal number of people for the exercise is thought to be six,
although it is not necessary. Each person generates three ideas in five minutes, and clearly
describes it using sketches and written descriptions on paper. At the end of five minutes, each
team member passes their ideas to another team member. The next person reviews the ideas
of their teammate and adds three more by building on them, developing new ones, or ignoring
as necessary. This process continues until all members have reviewed all papers.

    In the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) [Del71] each team member silently generates
ideas that are reported out in a round-robin fashion so that all members have an opportunity to
present their ideas. Concepts are selected by a multi-voting scheme with each member casting
a predetermined number of votes for the ideas presented. The ideas are then ranked, discussed
further, and voted upon again if necessary. The steps of NGT are as follows:

     Read problem statement. It should be read out loud by a team member (the facilitator).

     Restate the problem. Each person restates the problem in their own words to ensure that
       all members understand it.

     Silently generate ideas. All members silently generate ideas during a set period of time,
       typically 5-15 minutes.

     Collect ideas in a round-robin fashion. Each person presents one idea in turn until all
       ideas are exhausted. The facilitator should clarify ideas and all should be written where
       the entire team can view them.

     Summarize and rephrase ideas. Once the ideas are collected, the facilitator leads a discus-
       sion to clarify and rephrase the ideas. This ensures that the entire group is familiar with
       them. Related ideas can be grouped or merged together.

     Vote. Each person casts a predetermined number of votes, typically three to six, for
       the ideas presented. The outcome is a set of prioritized ideas that the team can further
       discuss and pursue.

    To systematically generate concepts, the problem is decomposed sub-functions and solutions
are sought for the sub-functions. A concept table, demonstrated in Table 4.1, is a tool
for identifying different combinations, arrangements, and substitutions. The table headings

identify functions to be achieved in the design, while the entries in the corresponding column
represent potential solutions. Novel products or solutions are generated by combining elements
from each of the columns, which are identified in the table by circled elements. The solutions
can be in the form of a single element selected from each column, or as in the example shown,
multiple elements selected from each column.

    Based on the concepts circled in Table 4.1, one can imagine a personal computing system
that has the following features: 1) is wearable with different credit card size components placed
on the body and in clothing to make it comfortable to use; 2) is powered by a combination of
solar cells, fuel-cells, and from thermal heat generated by a person's body; 3) has a microphone
and camera integrated in the user's clothing for interface to the system, as well as a flexible
foldable keyboard for typing that is stored in a pocket; 4) has a heads-up display integrated
with the user's eyeglasses or baseball hat; and 5) has a miniature earpiece microphone used for
communication. While the above example focused on novel combinations and substitutions,
the concept table can also be used to examine the possibility of eliminating ideas. For example,
the table inherently assumes that a display will be used. However, it should also be asked if it
is absolutely necessary in the design.

    Another example is shown in Table 4.2, where the objective is to identify design concepts
for a temperature measurement and display device. There are three main elements to the
proposed solution: the thermal sensing method, circuitry that converts the sensor information
(temperature) to a voltage, and a display unit that converts the voltage to a displayed tem-
perature. Note that the table implies a three-stage architecture, thus concepts are generated
within that framework. There may be completely different architectures that are better.

    A related tool is a concept fan, which is a graphical representation of design decisions and

Design decisions are identified by circles; solutions are indicated by squares. In this example,
more options are shown than in Table 4.2. Concepts are generated by selecting among the
different solution blocks.

Concept Evaluation

The concepts generated are evaluated to determine which are the most promising to pursue.
The designer should exercise engineering judgment and use the customer needs and technical
factors to drive the decision. This process is shown in Figure 4.3, where the user needs, con-
cepts, and engineering consideration serve as inputs to a decision process to ranks the concepts.
A point of caution--some of the methods presented generate numerical scores for comparing
concepts, leading one to potentially believe that the quantitative results are infallible. Keep in
mind that the inputs are based on qualitative and semi-quantitative assessments and can be
geared to select a preconceived notion of the solution. It is important to maintain flexibility
of thinking, to challenge assumptions, and ultimately determine the best concept.

Initial Evaluation

The concepts generated should be initially reviewed and those that are completely infeasible
discarded. Some of the reasons a concept may be deemed infeasible are that it may be far
too costly, will take too long to develop, or involve too much risk. In many cases it may be
deemed that using cutting-edge technology represents an unacceptable risk. Concepts that
clearly cannot meet the engineering requirements should also be discarded. Care should be
taken not to completely eliminate ideas that may have merit, as conditions change and some
concepts that were previously thought unrealistic may become viable in the future.

Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis

Another form of evaluation is to complete a strengths and weaknesses analysis of the
potential solutions. Table 4.3 demonstrates the application of this analysis applied to an
experimental design project for testing of the Intel 1000XF card (examined in Chapter 2 (Ex-
ample 2.2) and Chapter 3 (Table 3.2)). In order to test the card under different operating
temperatures, a method of heating the card and holding its temperature fixed during the ex-
periment was needed. The two solutions compared were to use a contact heating element or
to place the card in an environmental test chamber. In this particular example, the temper-
ature chamber solution was ultimately selected due to the need for a uniform temperature
distribution. The strength and weakness analysis is good for examining problems of moderate
complexity. It suffers in that it does not require uniform criteria for comparison. To make
the method more quantitative, relative scores for the strengths (plus factors) and weaknesses
(minus factors) can be assigned and used to score the concepts.

Analytical Hierarchy Process and Decision Matrices

In the Analytical Hierarchy Process, design alternatives are compared against pre-selected
criteria, such as the engineering or marketing requirements. AHP is covered in detail in Ap-
pendix B and was first applied in Chapter 2 for project selection. The reader is encouraged
to review Appendix B as necessary. The end result of AHP is a decision matrix is shown in
Table 4.4, where the criteria are listed in the leftmost column with the associated weighting
factors (i) quantifying the relative importance of the criteria. The body of the matrix contains

design ratings, ij, that reflect the technical merit of each of the jth design options relative to
ith criterion. The total score, Sj, for each design option is computed as a weighted summation
of the design ratings and weighting factors.

    The application of AHP is demonstrated for the design of an electronic circuit for measuring
temperature, by producing a voltage signal that is directly proportional to temperature.

Step 1: Determine the Selection Criteria

Assume that the criteria for comparing the concepts are high accuracy, low cost, small size,
and availability of parts for manufacture.

Step 2: Determine the Criteria Weightings

Assume that the criteria were ranked using pairwise comparison and weights computed (see
Appendix B) as shown in Table 4.5.

Step 3: Identify and Rate Alternatives Relative to the Criteria

Three candidate solutions are shown in Figure 4.5. Each acts as a constant current source
that drives a temperature measurement device (RTD). The resistance of an RTD varies with
temperature, and when driven by a constant current, I, produces a voltage, VT, that varies
proportionally with temperature. Each circuit supplies a constant current of I=1mA.

    The accuracy of each design was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis using a SPICE circuit
simulation package assuming 10% resistors. The deviation of the output voltage (maximum
deviation from nominal) for the three designs is 9.2%, 1.3%, and 1.9% respectively. Since the
objective is to minimize the deviation, the following rating metric is used:

                                                       min[deviation]
                                                =

                                                          deviation

This produces the following normalize design ratings for accuracy: 11 = 0.008, 12 = 0.55,
and 13 = 0.37.

    The parts costs are the following: resistors = $0.05, bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)
= $0.15, op amps = $0.35, and RTDs = $0.25. Using a measure for cost similar to (1) gives
following normalized cost ratings for the three options respectively: 21 = 0.31, 22 = 0.28,
and 23 = 0.31.

    Assume that to manufacture each circuit on a printed circuit board requires the following
dimensions: design 1 = 1 in2, design 2 = 1.56 in2, and design 3 = 2.25 in2. The objective
is to minimize size, and againusing a measure analogous to (1) for the required space to
manufacture each produces the following normalized decision ratings: 31 = 0.48, 32 = 0.31,
and 33 = 0.21.

    Assume that the parts have an in-stock availability of 95%, 70%, 90%, and 80% of the time
for the resistors, BJTs, RTDs, and op amps respectively. A measure for the overall availability
of parts to manufacture each design is required. One way to measure this is to compute the
probability that a design will be able to be manufactured based upon the past history of part
availability. This is found by multiplying the availability of all individual components needed
for the design:

    P (design 1 can be produced) = (0.95)(0.90)(0.70) = 0.60
    P (design 2 can be produced) = (0.95)(0.90)(0.80) = 0.68
    P (design 3 can be produced) = (0.95)(0.90) (0.70)(0.70) = 0.42
    This produces the following normalized decision ratings for availability: 41 = 0.35, 42 =
0.40, and 43 = 0.25.

Step 4: Compute Scores for the Alternatives

The decision matrix is built and the overall weighted scores for the alternatives are computed
as shown in Table 4.6.

Step 5: Review the Decision

Remember that this is a semi-quantitative method. The final ranking indicates that design
options 1 and 3 are quite similar, while both are inferior to option 2.

Pugh Concept Selection
Pugh Concept Selection is a method of comparing concepts against criteria, similar to what
we saw with a decision matrix. It is different in that it has a simpler scoring method and it is
an iterative process. The steps of Pugh Concept Selection are:

   1. Select the comparison criteria, usually the engineering or marketing requirements.
   2. Determine weights for the criterion.
   3. Determine the concepts.
   4. Select a baseline concept that is initially believed to be the best.
   5. Compare all other concepts to the baseline, using the following scoring method: +1 better

       than, 0 equal to, -1 worse than.
   6. Compute a weighted score for each concept, not including the baseline.
   7. Examine each concept to determine if it should be retained, updated, or dropped. Syn-

       thesize the best elements of others into other concepts wherever possible.
   8. Update the table and iterate until a superior concept emerges.

    An example of a Pugh Concept Selection matrix is shown in Table 4.7.

4.3 Project Application: Concept Generation and Evaluation

The following advice is provided for teams in the concept generation and evaluation phase:

     Set aside time specifically for concept generation and evaluation and take it as a challenge
       to identify as many concepts as possible.
70  CHAPTER 4. CONCEPT GENERATION AND EVALUATION

     Search externally, including literature reviews and patent searches.

     Search internally using brainstorming, brainwriting, or the Nominal Group Technique.
       Effective teams generate many concepts in a brainstorming session.

     Examine solutions for the entire design, for sub-functions of the design, and for individual
       components (such as integrated circuit selection). The techniques in this chapter can be
       combined with design methods presented in Chapters 5 and 6.

     Utilize SCAMPER, concept tables, and concepts fans as tools to facilitate and document
       concept generation.

     Critically and objectively evaluate concepts against common criteria.

     Clearly identify the concept(s) selected and the rationale for selection.

4.4 Summary and Further Reading

In the design process, it is important to creatively generate different concepts for a solution to a
problem. This is followed by an evaluation of concepts to determine which are the most promis-
ing. This chapter identified barriers to creativity and provided strategies for enhancing creative
ability. The concepts of vertical and lateral thinking were introduced, and their impact on the
design process was explored. Methods of concept generation, including brainstorming, concept
tables, and concepts fans were presented. Finally, methods for critically evaluating concepts
(strength/weakness analysis, Analytical Hierarchy Process, and Pugh Concept selection) were
presented.

    There are many references that examine creativity and concept generation. Adams [Ada01]
is a good reference for creativity and problem-solving with a technical bent. Alex Osborn was
an advocate of creativity and developed two readable works that address the creative process,
the need for creativity, and strategies for enhancing it [Osb48, Osb63]. Edward DeBono is
another well-known authority in the field and has produced many works on lateral thinking and
creativity [Deb67, Deb70]. Paul Sloane has published numerous books with lateral thinking
puzzles [Slo91, Slo93, Slo94]. TRIZ [Alt99] is a more advanced and complex approach to
concept generation, that centers around resolving tradeoffs in a problem. It is fairly complex
and may be considered by more advanced teams.

System Design I: Functional
Decomposition

       At Sony, we assume all products of our competitors will have basically the same
       technology, price, performance, and features. Design is the one thing that differen-
       tiates one product from another in the marketplace.--Norio Ohgo, Chairman and
       CEO, Sony

    After the technical concept is selected, it is translated into a solution that satisfies the
system requirements. The designer must put on paper, or the computer screen, a representation
that is meaningful and clear; in other words, a useful abstraction of the system. Engineering
designs are often complex, consisting of many systems and subsystems, thus this representation
should facilitate the design process and effectively describe the system. In addition, it serves
an important function in communicating the design to all members of the team. Imagine a
scenario where each team member is responsible for designing part of a large system. Each
person develops their part in isolation and several months later the team gets back together to
integrate the pieces. Of course, the system won't work unless the team has collectively defined
and communicated the functionality and interfaces for all subsystems in the design.

    This chapter presents a well-known design technique--known as functional decomposi-
tion--that is intuitive, flexible, and straightforward to apply. It is probably the most pervasive
design technique used for engineering systems and is applicable to a wide variety of problems
that extend well beyond electrical and computer engineering. In functional decomposition,
systems are designed by determining the overall functionality and then iteratively decomposing
it into component subsystems, each with its own functionality.

    The objective of this chapter is to present both basic design concepts and the functional
decomposition design technique. A process for functional decomposition is provided and it is
applied to examples in analog electronics, digital electronics, and software systems.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader should:

76  CHAPTER 5. SYSTEM DESIGN I: FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION

     Understand the differences between bottom-up and top-down design.
     Know what functional decomposition is and how to apply it.
     Be able to apply functional decomposition to different problem domains.
     Understand the concepts of coupling and cohesion, and how they impact designs.

5.1 Bottom-Up and Top-Down Design

Two general approaches to synthesizing engineering designs are known as bottom-up and
top-down. In the case of bottom-up, the designer starts with basic components and synthe-
sizes them to create the overall system. To use an analogy, consider the case of creating an
automobile. In the bottom-up approach, you have pieces of the automobile, such as the tires,
motor, axle, transmission, alternator, and they are brought together to create a car. The
implication is that the final system depends upon the parts at hand. In other words, in the
bottom-up approach, the parts and subsystems are given, and from them an artifact is created.

    The top-down approach is analogous to the concept of divide-and-conquer. In top-down the
designer has an overall vision of what the final system must do, and the problem is partitioned
into components, or subsystems that work together to achieve the overall goal. Then each
subsystem is successively refined and partitioned as necessary. In the case of the automobile,
the overall objective is determined; the major subsystems are defined, such as electrical, power
drive-train, and the suspension; and then each subsystem is further refined into its component
parts until the complete system is designed.

    A debate that continues in the design community revolves around which is the better
approach. It might appear that top-down is better, since it starts with the overall goal (re-
quirements) and from that a solution is developed. Top-down is particularly valuable on large
projects with many subsystems, where it is unlikely that bringing together pieces in an ad-hoc
fashion will successfully solve the problem. A disadvantage of top-down design is that it tends
to limit the solution space and innovation. Top-down design is inclined to follow a vertical
thought process (Chapter 4) where the designer starts with a problem and successively refines
the subsystems until a blueprint for solving the problem is defined. Furthermore, the de-
signer cannot create a top-down design in a vacuum without bottom-up knowledge of existing
technology and how the system can be realized.

    Bottom-up has the advantage of lending itself to creativity. It allows the designer to take
different technologies and from them create something new, allowing more "what if ? " questions
to be asked. Bottom-up design is applicable when there are constraints on the components
that can be used. This is a realistic scenario. Consider the case of variant design, where the
goal is to improve the performance of an existing, or legacy, system. For example, automobile
manufacturers might have to redesign their models to meet new emissions, mileage, or safety
standards. If you are not starting with a new design and must utilize existing systems, it
requires bottom-up thinking. In reality, most problems require a combination of bottom-up
and top-down thinking, and the designer must alternate between them.

    In summary, it is most effective to work between bottom-up and top-down. A completely
top-down approach is not feasible because the designer must have an understanding of the
bottom level technology for the components of the design hierarchy to be realistic. Likewise,
completely bottom-up by itself is generally not feasible, particularly as the system complexity
grows.

5.2 Functional Decomposition

Functional decomposition is a recursive process that iteratively describes the functionality
of all system components. It is analogous to the mathematical concept of a function, for
example, y = f (x). In this function there is an input, x, an output, y, and a transformation
between the input and output, f . This is easily extended to the case of multiple inputs and
outputs where the inputs and outputs are vectors, y = f (x). In functional decomposition,
the same items are defined as in the mathematical analogy--the inputs, the outputs, and
the transformation between the inputs and outputs (the functionality). Those three items
constitute what is known as the functional specification or functional requirement--the
requirement that a functional module should meet. A module is a block, or subsystem, that
performs a function. Functional decomposition has a strong top-down flavor, due to the fact
that the highest level functionality is defined and then further refined into sub-functions, each
with its own inputs, outputs, and functionality. The process is repeated until some base level
functionality is reached where the modules can be actualized with physical components.

    A process for applying functional decomposition is illustrated in Figure 5.1. It starts with
a definition of the highest level (Level 0) of system functionality (the functional requirement
for the system). This is followed by definition of the next level of the hierarchy that is needed
to achieve the design objective. The Level 1 design is typically referred to as the main design
architecture of the system. In this context, architecture means the organization and intercon-
nections between modules. Care must be taken at each design level to ensure that it satisfies
the requirements of the higher level. The process is repeated for successive levels of the design
and stops when the detailed design level is reached. Detailed design is where the problem
can be decomposed no further and the identification of elements such as circuit components,
logic gates, or software code takes place. The number of levels in the design hierarchy depends
upon the complexity of the problem.

5.3 Guidance

The following guidance is provided before examining applications of the functional decompo-
sition technique:

     It is an iterative process. During the first pass, it is not possible to know all of the detailed
       interfaces between components and the exact functionality of each block. In fact, some
       details are not known until the implementation level is reached, so the designer needs to
       iterate, work between top-down and bottom-up, and adjust the design as necessary.
78  CHAPTER 5. SYSTEM DESIGN I: FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION

     Set aside sufficient time to develop the design. This is a corollary to the previous point.
       The iterative nature means that it takes time to examine different solutions and to refine
       the details into a working solution.

     Pair together items of similar complexity. Modules at each level should have similar
       complexity and granularity.

     A good design will have the interfaces and functionality of modules well-defined. It is fairly
       easy to piece together some blocks into an apparently reasonable design. However, the
       functional requirements should be clearly defined and the technical feasibility understood.
       If not, the design will fall apart when it comes to the implementation stage. Consider
       the following advice of a well-known architectural designer:

             The details are not the details. They make the design.--Charles Eames

     Look for innovations. Top-down designs tend to follow a vertical thinking process, where
       the designer proceeds linearly from problem to solution. Try to incorporate lateral think-
       ing strategies from Chapter 4 and examine alternative architectures and technologies for
       the solution.

     Don't take functional requirements to the absurd level. Common elements, such as analog
       multipliers or digital logic gates, do not require explicit functional specifications. Doing
       so may become cumbersome and add little to the design. However, it depends upon the
       level at which you are working. If the goal is to design an analog multiplier chip, it is
       entirely appropriate to develop the functional requirement for the multiplier.

     Combine functional decomposition with other methods of describing system behavior.
       There is no single method or unifying theory for developing designs. Functional de-
       composition alone cannot describe all system behaviors. It may be supplemented by
       other tools such as flowcharts (logical behavior), state diagrams (stimulus-response), or
       data flow diagrams. In the digital stopwatch example presented later in this chapter, the
       behavior is defined using state diagrams. Other methods for describing system behavior
       are addressed in Chapter 6.

     Find similar design architectures. Determine if there exist similar designs and how they
       operate. Realize that this creates a bias towards existing solutions.

     Use existing technology. Many designers take the attitude that they are going to develop
       the entire design themselves, the sentiment being to ignore technology that they did not
       develop. Furthermore, engineering education predisposes us to design at a fundamental
       level. Both factors lead to time spent re-inventing the wheel. If existing technology is
       available that meets both the engineering and cost requirements, then use it.

     Keep it simple. Do not add complexity that is not needed.

             A designer knows that he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left
             to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.--Antoine de St-Exupery

     Communicate the results. It is important to describe the theory of operation (the why)
       as well as the implementation (the what). The what in the completed design is usually
       quite clear from the implementation, but documenting the description of operation and
       design decisions helps later when the system must upgraded. Designs can also become
5.4. APPLICATION: ELECTRONICS DESIGN                       79

very complex, so consider how much information can be effectively communicated on a
single page. If the information is too complex to show reasonably on a page or two, then
it probably is too detailed and another level in the hierarchy should be added.

5.4 Application: Electronics Design

We now examine the application of functional decomposition in different problem domains. In
the domain of analog electronics, the inputs and outputs of modules are voltage and current
signals. Typical transformations applied to the inputs are alterations in amplitude, power,
phase, frequency, and spectral characteristics. Consider the design of an audio power amplifier
that has the following engineering requirements.

    The system must

     Accept an audio input signal source with a maximum input voltage of 0.5V peak.

     Have adjustable volume control between zero and the maximum volume level.

     Deliver a maximum of 50W to an 8W speaker.

     Be powered by a standard 120V 60Hz AC outlet.

Level 0

The Level 0 functionality for the amplifier is shown in Figure 5.2, which is fairly simple--
the inputs are an audio signal, volume control, and wall outlet power, and the output is an
amplified audio signal.

audio input signal  Audio Power       audio output signal
  volume control      Amplifier

power, 120 VAC

Figure 5.2: Level 0 audio power amplifier functionality.

    The system should be described in as much detail as possible for each level via the functional
requirement. The Level 0 functional requirement for this design is shown in the Audio power
amplifier Module, Table 5.1.

    Not all values can be known on the first pass through the design as was indicated in the
guidelines. Underlined items represent values that need to be determined or refined as the
design proceeds. In this case, the peak value of the audio output voltage is determined from
the system requirements on power gain. Knowing that the maximum poweris given by Pmax =
Vp2eak/R, allows the maximum output voltage to be computed as Vpeak = 8  50W = 20V .

Level 1

The Level 1 diagram, or system architecture, is shown in Figure 5.3. This architecture is com-
mon in amplifier design and is but one possible solution. It contains three cascaded amplifier
stages and a DC supply that powers the three stages. The first amplifier stage, the buffer am-
plifier, provides a high resistance buffer that minimizes loading effects with the source. Buffer

amplifiers have extremely high input resistance and a unity signal gain. The high gain ampli-
fier increases the amplitude of the signal, but provides little in terms of the output current
necessary to drive the speakers. The last stage in the cascade is the power output stage, which
provides the current needed to drive the speakers, but has no voltage amplification.

                                                                                     volume control

               Figure 5.3: Level 1 audio amplifier design.

    The functional requirements for the Level 1 subsystems are now detailed, starting with the
Buffer amplifier Module, Table 5.2.

Inputs              Audio input signal: 0.5V peak.
Outputs

                    Audio signal: 0.5V peak.
               Buffer the input signal and provide unity voltage gain. It should
               have an input resistance >1MW and an output resistance <100W.

    Where did the ± 25V DC value for the DC input power come from? The system must
5.4. APPLICATION: ELECTRONICS DESIGN                                             81

produce a ± 20V AC output signal to satisfy the Level 0 requirement, so supply values that
exceed that are required to power the electronics. How about the values for the input and
output resistance? They are educated guesses, based on knowledge of what is achievable with
the technology (bottom-up knowledge). The exact resistance requirements are refined later
based upon the overall design, taking into account the input and output resistances for all
stages.

    Now consider the functional requirements shown in the High gain amplifier Module,
Table 5.3.

Module         High gain amplifier

Inputs          Audio input signal: 0.5V peak.
                User volume control: variable control.

Outputs             Power: ± 25V DC
Functionality
                    Audio signal: 20V peak.
               Provide an adjustable voltage gain, between 1 and 40. It should
               have an input resistance >100kW and an output resistance <100W.

    The gain of 40 is determined from the overall system power and gain requirements (the
maximum input voltage of 0.5V must be able to be amplified to 20V), while the resistances
are again educated guesses.

    Now consider the requirements described in the Power output stage Module, Table 5.4.

Module         Power output stage

Inputs              Audio input signal: 20V peak.
Outputs
Functionality       Power: ± 25V DC.

                    Audio signal: 20V peak at up to 2.5A.
               Provide unity voltage gain with output current as required by a
               resistive load of up to 2.5A. It should have an input resistance
               >1MW and output resistance <1W.

    For the power output stage, it is clear that 20V peak needs to be delivered, but how was
the requirement on current determined? The current needed to drive the speaker is determined
from Ohm's Law as I = V /R = 10V /8 = 2.5A.

    The last module to examine at this level is the power supply described in the Power
supply Module, Table 5.5.

    It is clear that the power supply needs to deliver ± 25V DC, while the 3.0A current
capability was selected to supply the 2.5A needed for the peak output power requirement plus
the current needed to power the other amplifier stages.

    Finally, it is necessary to determine if the values of the input and output resistances selected
for the stages are realistic. For cascaded amplifier stages, the overall voltage gain is given by
the product of gains multiplied by the voltage divider losses between stages [Sed04]. In this
case the overall gain is

        V oltagegain = gain1  gain2  gain3  Rin2  Rin3
                                      Rin2 + Rout1      Rin3 + Rout2

                      lation of <1%.

               Convert AC wall outlet voltage to positive and negative DC out-
               put voltages, and provide enough current to drive all amplifiers.

                                100k + 100 1M + 100

    So the resistance values selected in the functional requirements satisfy the overall system
requirements. If not, it would be necessary to go back and refine them.

Level 2

At this point, the three amplifier stages are ready for detailed component level design, while
the power supply needs another level of refinement as shown in Figure 5.4. The functional
requirement for each of the elements in the power supply would be developed similarly. Func-
tional decomposition stops at this point--all levels of the hierarchy are defined and the next
step is the detailed design, where the actual circuit components are determined.

5.5 Application: Digital Design

Functional decomposition is widely applied to the design of digital systems, where it is known
as entity-architecture design. The inputs and outputs refer to the entity, and the architecture
describes the functionality. The application of functional decomposition to digital systems is
demonstrated in the following example. Consider the design of a simple digital stopwatch that
keeps track of seconds and has the following engineering requirements.

    The system must

     Have no more than two control buttons.

     Implement Run, Stop, and Reset functions.

     Output a 16-bit binary number that represents seconds elapsed.

Level 0

The Level 0 diagram and functional requirements are shown in Figure 5.5.
    The Level 0 functional requirement for this design is shown in the Stopwatch Module,

Table 5.6.

                      toggles between run and stop modes.

               The stopwatch counts the number of seconds after B is pushed
               when the system is in the Reset or Stop mode. When in Run
               mode and B is pushed, the stopwatch stops counting. A reset
               button push (A) will reset the output value of the counter to zero
               only when in Stop mode.

Level 1

The Level 1 architecture in Figure 5.6 contains three modules: a seconds counter, a clock
divider, and a finite state machine (FSM). The stopwatch counts seconds, thus the seconds
counter module counts the seconds and outputs a 16-bit number representing the number of
seconds elapsed. The clock divider generates a 1Hz signal that triggers the seconds counter.
The FSM responds to the button press stimuli and produces the appropriate control signals
for the seconds counter. The system clock is included to clock both the FSM and the clock
divider.

    The functionality of the Level 1 modules is described as follows, starting with the Finite
state machine Module, Table 5.7.

    The functionality of the finite state machine is described with a tool that is probably familiar
to the reader, the state diagram. State diagrams are covered in more detail in Chapter 6. The
state diagram describes stimulus-response behavior, and shows how the system transitions
between states based upon logic signals from the button presses.

    Next, consider the Clock divider Module, Table 5.8.
    The value of 32,768 Hz was selected for the system clock for several reasons. It is a power
of 2 that is easily divisible by digital circuitry to produce a 1Hz output signal. It is also well
above the clock rate needed for detecting button presses and there is a wide selection of crystals
that can meet this requirement.
    Finally, consider the Second counter Module, Table 5.9.
    The system decomposition would end here, assuming that the design is to be implemented
using off-the-shelf chips. The next step would be to determine components at the detailed
design level. However, if it were an integrated circuit design, the description would continue
until the transistor level is reached.

5.6 Application: Software Design

Software also lends itself to functional decomposition since virtually all computing languages
provide the capability to call functions, subroutines, or modules. Functional software design
simplifies program development by eliminating the need to create redundant code via the use
of functions that are called repeatedly.

    Structure charts are specialized block diagrams for visualizing functional software de-
signs. The modules used in a structure chart are shown in Figure 5.7. The larger arrows
indicate connections to other modules, while the smaller arrows represent data and control

information passed between modules. Five basic modules are utilized:

   1. Input modules. Receive information.
   2. Output modules. Return information.
   3. Transform modules. Receive information, change it, and return the changed information.
   4. Coordination modules. Coordinate or synchronize activities between modules.
   5. Composite modules. Any possible combination of the other four.

    This approach to software design, also known as structured design, was formalized in the
1970's by IBM researchers [Ste99].

    The following example demonstrates the application of functional decomposition to a soft-
ware design with the following requirements.

    The system must

     Accept an ASCII file of integer numbers as input.
86  CHAPTER 5. SYSTEM DESIGN I: FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION

     Sort the numbers into ascending order and save the sorted numbers to disk.

     Compute the mean of the numbers.

     Display the mean on the screen.

    This is a fairly simple task that could easily be done in a single function, but doing so
would not allow components of the design to be easily reused, tested, or troubleshot. The
engineering requirements themselves provide some guidance in terms of how to arrange the
functionality of the modules (form follows function). The architecture in Figure 5.8 contains
a main module that calls three sub-modules. In this design main is a coordinating module
that controls the processing and calling of the other modules, a common scenario. It was also
decided that all user interaction would take place within main. The order of the processing
is not described by structure charts. In our program, main calls ReadArray, SortArray, and
ComputeMean in sequential order. main passes the filename (fname) to ReadArray, which
reads in the array and the number of elements in it, and returns this information to main. The
choice of passing in the filename was deliberate; the user could have been prompted for the
filename in ReadArray, but doing so might limit future reuse of the function since you may not
always want to do so when reading an array of data. SortArray is then called, which accepts
the array of numbers and the number of elements in the array, and returns the sorted values
in the same array. Finally, ComputeMean is executed, which accepts the sorted array and the
number of elements, computes the mean value, and returns it to main.

          Figure 5.8: Structure chart design of sorting and mean computation program.

    The functional requirements for each module in the structure chart are detailed in Ta-
ble 5.10. The structure chart provides a visual relationship between modules in the design,
but also has some disadvantages. It is difficult to visualize designs as the complexity of the
software increases. This can be addressed by expanding sublevels in the design as necessary
in different diagrams. Structure charts also lack a temporal aspect that indicates the calling
order. Most software systems have many layers in the hierarchy and highly complex calling
patterns. In this example, main calls three modules in a well-defined order, but if there was
another level in the hierarchy, there is no reason why it could not be called by a module at
any other level. That leads to some of the unique problems associated with software design.
Functional design works well for small-to-moderately complex software, but tends to fall short
when applied to large scale software systems. As such, it has given way to the object-oriented
design approach.
5.7. APPLICATION: THERMOMETER DESIGN                    87

5.7 Application: Thermometer Design

The final example includes both analog and digital modules where the objective is to design a
thermometer that meets the following engineering requirements.

    The system must

     Measure temperature between 0 and 200C.

     Have an accuracy of 0.4% of full scale.

     Display the temperature digitally, including one digit beyond the decimal point.

     Be powered by a standard 120V 60Hz AC outlet.

     Use an RTD (thermal resistive device) that has an accuracy of 0.55C over the range.
       The resistance of the RTD varies linearly with temperature from 100 at 0C to 178
       at 200C. (Note: this requirement does not meet the abstractness property identified in
       Chapter 3, since it identifies part of the solution. This requirement is given to provide
       guidance in this example.)

Level 0

The overall goal is to convert a sensed temperature to a digital temperature reading. The Level
0 description description is shown in Figure 5.9.

    The input, output and functioality of the signal in Figure 5.9 are described in the Digital
thermometer Module, Table 5.11.

Level 1

The Level 1 architecture selected is shown in Figure 5.10. The temperature conversion unit
converts the temperature to an analog voltage using the RTD that is sampled by the analog-to-
digital converter. The N-bit binary output from the converter is translated into binary-coded
decimal (BCD). BCD is a 4-bit representation of the digits between 0 and 9. Since there are
four display digits, there are four separate binary encoded outputs from the BCD conversion
unit. Common 7-segment LEDs are used for the display. However, they do not directly accept
BCD and instead have seven input lines, each of which is individually switched to control the
display segments. The requirements did not specifically address cost or size constraints, nor
clearly define the environment, so there are many possible solutions. For example, an analog-
to-digital current converter could be used, integrated circuit temperature sensing packages
could be considered, and microcontroller-based solutions are feasible as well.

    From a system design perspective, an error budget is needed to identify the maximum
error that each subsystem may introduce, while still achieving the overall accuracy. In this

case, error is introduced in the temperature conversion unit and A/D converter, but not in
the remaining digital components. The overall accuracy that the system must achieve is 0.4%,
and that translates into 0.8°C of allowable error for the 200°C range. Let's now examine the
modules.

    The functionality of the Level 1 modules is described as follows, starting with the temper-
ature conversion unit. the Temperature conversion unit supply Module, Table 5.12.

    There are several unknowns at this point. The voltage necessary to power the electronics
is not known, but a reasonable assumption could be made. The output voltage range and the
accuracy are unknown. It is known that the RTD will introduce up to 0.55°C of error and that
the electronics themselves will introduce additional error (the exact amount is unknown at this

is 0.6°C. This means that the electronics themselves would be required to introduce no more
than 0.05°C of error due to the 0.55°C of error introduced by the RTD.

    Now consider the the A/D converter Module, Table 5.13.

90             CHAPTER 5. SYSTEM DESIGN I: FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION

    The A/D converter is not likely to be something that is designed due to the availability of
low cost, off-the-shelf solutions. The requirements drive the converter selection. There are two
unknowns--the number of bits and the range of the input voltage. The number of bits affects
the accuracy, since the greater the number of bits, the better the accuracy. The number of
bits needed for the converter is calculated from the maximum allowable error that the A/D
can introduce (0.2°C), the number of discrete intervals, and the temperate range as

                     range          200C   
        M axerror =                 = N  0.2 C  N  9.97bits
                     numberof intervals 2

    So the A/D converter needs to have at least 10 bits. How is the voltage range selected? It
is typically fixed for a particular integrated circuit solution, but the temperature conversion
subsystem output should be matched to the voltage range so that all bits are effectively utilized,
otherwise, error is introduced.

    Now, consider the BCD conversion unit Module, Table 5.14.

               Converts the 10-bit binary number to BCD representation of tem-
               perature. Must refresh the displays twice a second.

    The objective of the BCD conversion unit is fairly simple, although the component level
design of the circuitry to accomplish the conversion is not.

    This leads to the last module, the 7-Segment LED driver Module, Table 5.15.
    For completeness, the functional requirements of the Power supply Module, Table 5.16
are supplied. They are similar to the power supply requirements utilized in the audio amplifier
design in Section 5.4.
    At this point, the requirements for the major subsystems are completed and ready for
design at the component level. Illustration of the complete design would require a fair amount
of detail, and while it is not presented here, some of the issues involved are discussed. First,
there are a variety of electronic circuits (inverting op amps, single BJT configurations, and
current mirrors, etc.--see Section 4.2 ) that could be utilized as a current source to drive
the RTD in the temperature conversion subsystem. A midrange resolution A/D converter is
needed, and its particular input voltage range drives the output voltage requirements for the
temperature conversion module. The BCD conversion circuitry could be implemented using
combinational digital logic (tedious due to the number of discrete gates), or a more efficient,
but slower, sequential logic design. Finally, the 7-segment display converters could be designed
using combinational logic that maps the BCD inputs into outputs to activate the appropriate
display segments.

5.8 Coupling and Cohesion

The concepts of coupling and cohesion are examined before concluding this chapter. They
originated to describe software designs [Ste99], but are applicable to electrical and computer
systems. To understand their importance, consider the relationship between the number of
modules in a system and the number of connections between them. For our purposes, a
connection between two modules may consist of any number of signals without regard to
their direction. Thus, a system consisting of two modules has, at most, one connection. If
the number of modules is increased to three, the number of possible connections increases to
three, a system with four modules has six possible connections, and five modules increases the
number of possible connections to ten. The point is that the maximum number of potential
connections increases rapidly with the number of modules in the system. The relationship
between the maximum possible connections and number of modules (n) is given by

                                                                     n(n - 1)
                                           Connectionsmax = 2

    Modules are coupled if they depend upon each other in some way to operate properly.
Coupling is the extent to which modules or subsystems are connected [Jal97]. Although
there is no agreed upon mathematical definition of coupling, it seems obvious that increasing
the exchange of control and data between two modules leads to a higher degree of coupling.
When systems are highly coupled, it is difficult to change one module without impacting the
other. Consider the extreme case where all modules in a system are connected to each other--
an error in one module has the potential to impact every other module in the system. Errors
in a module are propagated to others to a degree that is related to the amount of coupling.
92  CHAPTER 5. SYSTEM DESIGN I: FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION

From this point of view, it is good to minimize coupling. Yet coupling cannot be eliminated,
since the point of functional decomposition is to break a design into components that work
together to produce a higher level behavior.

    There are two ways to reduce coupling--minimize the number of connections between
modules and maximize cohesion within modules. Cohesion refers to how focused a module
is--highly cohesive systems do one or a few things very well. Stevens et al. [Ste99] defined
six types of cohesion from the weakest to strongest as: coincidental, logical, temporal, commu-
nicational, sequential, and functional. More information on this can be found in the original
work, but the conclusion is that modules with high functional cohesion are the most desirable.
So it is best to design modules with a single well-defined functional objective consistent with
the philosophy of functional decomposition. This leads to the important design principle that
it is desirable to maximize cohesion, while minimizing coupling.

    Coupling and cohesion impact the later stages of testing and system integration. If a
particular module is highly cohesive, then it should be possible to test it independently of the
other modules to verify its operability. This does not mean that it will necessarily operate
properly when integrated into the overall system, but the probability that it will is higher
if provided with proper inputs from connected modules. Contrast this to the case of a low
cohesion system. In that case, it will likely be difficult to test the individual modules without
first integrating them.

    To develop a better understanding, consider the amplifier design in Figure 5.3 (Section 5.4)
with three cascaded amplifier stages. Each stage is highly cohesive, performing a singular
function of signal amplification. Each of these stages could easily operate as a stand-alone
module independent of the complete system. How about coupling? In terms of the number
of connections, it is fairly low as each amplifier stage has an input and output voltage signal.
The most coupled module in the system is the power supply, and not surprisingly, its failure
leads to a complete system failure. Coupling in this case can also be viewed in terms of the
resistance matching between input and output of the cascaded stages, producing the voltage
divider effect in equation (1). For voltage amplifiers, the goal is to have high input resistance
and low output resistance, which minimize both voltage losses and coupling. The stages are not
completely uncoupled, because the input resistances, although large, are not infinite, and the
output resistances are not zero. The modules in the power supply unit in Figure 5.4 (rectifier,
smoothing filter, and regulator) have a much higher degree of coupling. In fact, it is difficult
to develop a clear functional decomposition of the power supply module because the elements
in the smoothing filter also serve as part of the rectifier circuit (refer to a basic electronics
textbook [Sed04] for more information).

    As another example, consider a software design where two options are under consideration:
one large function with 1000 lines of code, versus 15 cohesive functions, each with an average
of 100 lines of code. Both perform the same function, but which runs faster? Most likely the
first, as it would be highly integrated and would not suffer from overhead needed with multiple
functions. Which is easier to upgrade and debug a year from now? That is clearly the second
case. Although loosely coupled and highly cohesive designs may facilitate better design and
testing, they may not be best in terms of performance.

       for the choices made. This should be based upon concept evaluation methods communi-
       cated in Chapter 4.

5.10 Summary and Further Reading

This chapter presented the functional decomposition design technique, where every level of the
design is decomposed into sub-modules, each of which is the domain of the next lower level.
The inputs, outputs, and functionality must be determined for a given module. Applying the
process in Figure 5.1 and following the guidelines in Section 5.3 should aid in the application
of functional decomposition. Functional decomposition is applicable to a wide variety of sys-
tems, and in this chapter designs of analog electronics, digital electronics, and software were
examined.

    Nigel Cross presents a good overview of the functional decomposition method with appli-
cation to mechanical systems [Cro00], but with less focus on the description of the functional
requirements than presented here. The work by Stevens et al. [Ste99] is interesting reading
that gives an understanding of the evolution of structured design. It delves into the concepts
of coupling and cohesion. Coupling and cohesion are also addressed well in the book by Jalote
[Jal97]. An in-depth treatment of structured systems design is found in The Practical Guide
to Structured Systems Design [Pag88]. This guide also integrates data flow diagrams with
functional techniques. Finally, the thermometer design example was inspired by Stadtmiller's
book [Sta01] on electronics design.

System Design II: Behavior Models

       Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.--Thomas Edison
    The functional decomposition technique examined in Chapter 5 is a powerful modeling
tool for system design that is applicable for describing input, output, and transform behavior.
However, that approach by itself is limited in its descriptive ability. This was apparent in the
digital stopwatch example that required the use of state diagrams, in addition to functional
decomposition, to fully articulate the design. A state diagram is an example of a model, a
standardized abstraction of a system. Models allow systems to be described without having
to determine all of the implementation details. All models are not the same--they come in a
variety of forms and each serves a different intention.
    This chapter provides an overview of other design tools for describing system behavior,
with an emphasis on computing systems. The first tool examined is the state diagram. This
is followed by the flowchart, which describes algorithmic processes and logical behavior. Two
modeling languages for information and data handling--data flow diagrams and entity rela-
tionship diagrams--are then examined. The final is the Unified Modeling Language, which is
a collection of system views for describing behavior.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader should:
     Be familiar with the following modeling tools for describing system behavior: state di-
       agrams, flowcharts, data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, and the Unified
       Modeling Language.
     Understand the intention and expressive power of the different models.
     Understand the domains in which the models apply.
     Be able to conduct analysis and design with the models.
     Understand what model types to choose for a given design problem.

98  CHAPTER 6. SYSTEM DESIGN II: BEHAVIOR MODELS

6.1 Models

From the previous chapter we know that the top-down design process starts with an abstraction
of the system to be built. This initial design is called an abstraction because it captures the
essential characteristics of the system without specifying the underlying physical realization.
An abstraction that is expressed in a standardized and accepted language is called a model.
In other words a model is a standardized representation of a system, process, or object which
captures its essential details without specifying the physical realization. A modeling language
does not have to be formed from letters and words--often the words are graphical symbols.
You are already familiar with many different models from everyday life such as blueprints,
a diagram of a football play, knitting instructions, electrical schematics, and mathematical
formulas to name a few. In order to be effective, a model should meet the following properties
[Sat02]:

     Be abstract. This means that the model should be independent of final implementation
       and that there should be multiple ways of implementing the design based upon it.

     Be unambiguous. A model should have a single clear meaning in terms of describing the
       intended behavior.

     Allow for innovation. Models should encourage exploration of alternative system imple-
       mentations and behaviors.

     Be standardized. Standardization provides a common language that can be understood
       by all. Designers should be wary of developing their own models that are ill-defined and
       not commonly understood.

     Provide a means for communication. A model should facilitate communication within
       the design team and with non-technical stakeholders.

     Be modifiable. A model should make design modifications relatively easy.

     Remove unnecessary details and emphasize important features. The intent is to simplify
       the design for ease of understanding. The most highly detailed information is typically
       identified in the detailed design.

     Break the overall problem into sub-problems. Most problems are too complex to be
       handled directly and must be decomposed into subsystems. This produces the design
       hierarchy.

     Substitute a sequence of actions by a single action. This allows understanding of the
       overall larger behavior, which can then be examined at other levels. This supports the
       ability to break a design into sub-problems.

     Assist in verification. A model should aid in demonstrating that the design meets the
       engineering requirements.

     Assist in validation. Validation is the process of demonstrating that the needs of the
       user are being met and the right system is being designed. The model should facilitate
       discussion with all stakeholders to ensure it meets everyone's expectations.
6.2. STATE DIAGRAMS                                  99

    In order to meet these properties, most models have an object type, which is capable of
encapsulating the actual components used to construct the target system. In order to capture
the dependence of objects on one another models typically have a relationship type. Finally,
models have an intention, which is the intended class of behavior that it describes. For
example, the intention of a circuit schematic and the schematic of a football play are entirely
different. Since models are built with different intentions, it possible to choose the wrong
model for a particular system--it would surprise a football team to see a play represented with
resistors and capacitors!

    Since models capture the essential details of a system in a standardized way then they are
an ideal way to describe the functionality of a system at all levels of detail. In Chapter 5 the
predominate method of describing functionality was with words. However, there are languages
that describe system behavior. We start by examining state diagrams.

6.2 State Diagrams

State diagrams describe the behavior of systems with memory. A system with memory is
able to modify its response to inputs based on the state of the system. The state of a system
represents the net effect of all previous inputs to the system. Since the state characterizes
the history of previous inputs, it is often synonymous with the word memory. Intuitively, a
state corresponds to an operating mode of a system, and inputs are associated with transitions
between states. To determine if a system has memory, ask the following question-- "Can the
same input produce different outputs? " If the answer to this question is yes, then the system
has memory and can be modeled with a state diagram.

    A state diagram is a drawing that consists of states and transition arcs as shown in Fig-
ure 6.1. Each state is represented as a rectangle with rounded edges with the name of the state
written inside. Whenever possible, states should be given meaningful names. When there
exists the possibility for ambiguity in the names, a table should be created that identifies the
state names and their associated meanings. There are special circle symbols for both initial
and final states. Transitions are drawn as arrows from a source state to a destination state.
Since inputs cause the transitions between states, the arrows are labeled with their associated
inputs. The outputs are listed directly in the state since it is assumed that the outputs are
associated with states.

State                               = Initial State

                     = Transitions  = Final State

Figure 6.1: Symbols used in state diagrams.

    As an example, consider a vending machine that accepts nickels and dimes and dispenses a
piece of candy when 25 cents has been deposited. This vending machine can be modeled using
a state diagram because the response of the machine to a coin depends on how much money
has been deposited so far.

    In order to give a more complete description of the vending machine the state diagram is
embedded into the function table template introduce in Chapter 5 as shown in Table 6.1. This
100                  CHAPTER 6. SYSTEM DESIGN II: BEHAVIOR MODELS

table lists the inputs and outputs of the vending machine along with the behavior represented
by a state diagram.

Module         Table 6.1: A state diagram for a simple vending machine.

                    Vend: Signal to dispense candy.

               dime      $0.05    dime

                     nickel
                         $0.15

                     nickel
                         $0.20

                     nickel
                        >= $0.25

    The initialization/reset state is labeled $0.00, while the action of the machine (dispense or
not dispense candy) is associated with the states--the only state that dispenses candy is $0.25.
There are three types of transitions shown in this state diagram. The two labeled nickel and
dime are associated with depositing those coins. The unlabeled transition from state $0.25 to
state $0.00 is called an unconditional transition. A system with an unconditional transition
between two states is assumed to remain in the first state for a defined time period before
automatically moving to the second state. In this case it ensures that the machine dispenses a
single candy before going on to the next transaction. It is common practice in state diagrams
to assume that any unspecified input conditions cause the system to remain in the current
state. For example, if no coin is inserted while in state $0.20 the system remains in state $0.20.
Finally, note that since this machine does not dispense change, it can overcharge a customer
for candy. This would not be a popular vending machine with users!

6.3 Flowcharts

The intention of a flowchart is to visually describe a process or algorithm, including its steps
and control. Flowcharts are often scoffed at as being old-fashioned and overly simple--these
6.4. DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS                                    101

criticisms are actually strengths. Since flowcharts have been around for a long time, they are
easily recognized and understood. Furthermore, being simple makes them accessible to a wide
audience. Due to their simplicity, they are applied in a great number of applications, including
non-technical ones such as the description of business processes.

    Some of the primary symbols used in flowcharts are shown in Figure 6.2. The names of the
starting and ending steps of a flowchart are represented by ovals known as terminators. Indi-
vidual processing steps are written inside of rectangles, while a process step that is elaborated
by another flowchart is drawn as a rectangle with double sides. Elaborated processes allow the
representation of hierarchy in the design. Certain points in a flowchart can lead to alternative
destinations as represented by a decision or conditional symbol (diamond). The condition that
determines the next step is written inside the diamond and the possible values of the condition
are written on the arcs leaving the conditional step. As shown in Figure 6.2 there are multiple
ways to indicate data stores for retrieving or saving data.

                                     Figure 6.2: Basic flowchart symbols.

    As an application, consider an embedded computer system that monitors the light level
of its environment as described by the flowchart in Table 6.2. The algorithmic process of the
flowchart is easy and intuitive to understand. The system reads the current light value, stores
it into an array, and then computes an average. In a complete system description, there would
be a second flowchart describing how the system determines the average of the values of the
light samples, since this is identified as an elaborated process. The system then waits 1ms,
writes the average to a terminal (display device), and then checks for a key-press. Light levels
continue to be monitored in the absence of a key-press, otherwise the light monitoring process
halts.

    Flowcharts are an intuitive way to describe algorithmic processes. Limiting the complex-
ity of a flowchart to between 10 and 20 steps enables the sequence of actions to be quickly
comprehended while eliminating unnecessary details. Flowcharts are not able to represent
the structure of data being manipulated and they are not particularly good at representing
concurrent processes. For this we need data flow diagrams.

6.4 Data Flow Diagrams

The intention of a data flow diagram (DFD) is to model the processing and flow of data inside
a system. It is a function-oriented approach that is similar to functional decomposition--the
processes inside a DFD accept data inputs, transform them in some way, and produce output
data. A DFD is often used for the analysis of information systems due to its data emphasis,
but can be broadly applied to ECE systems. It differs from functional decomposition in that
functional decomposition is often closer to the implementation of the design, whereas the

DFD models the system from a data point of view. A DFD is fundamentally different from
a flowchart in that it does not encapsulate control and sequencing information, but allows
multiple processes running concurrently. There are four symbols, shown in Figure 6.3, that are
used in a DFD:

   1. Processes. A rectangle with rounded corners that describes a useful task or function.
       They perform a transformation on the data.

   2. Data flows. An arrow representing a data relationship between two processes.

   3. Data stores. An open rectangle representing a data repository.

   4. Interfaces. A square describing external agents or entities that use the system. They are
       also referred to as sources and sinks.

     Process                    Data Flow               Data Store                 Interface

                                   Figure 6.3: Data flow diagram symbols.

    Like the general design process, DFDs are successively refined from the top-down. That
is, there is a single top level (or Level 0) DFD describing the entire system and the interfaces
and data stores that it interacts with. The rules for constructing a DFD are fairly intuitive. A
process must have at least one input and one output. The refinement of a process at level N
must have the same inputs and outputs as the process at level N-1. Data must be transformed
in some way by a process. This process of refinement continues until a satisfactory level of
detail is reached.

    An example of a Level 1 DFD for a video browsing system is shown in Table 6.3. Video
databases are typically very large; due to their size, it is usually cumbersome to preview videos
and extract important information. A solution to this problem is to apply image analysis
techniques to identify shots (continuous scenes without a break) in a video and store both the
location of the shot boundaries in the video and key frames that summarize each shot. The
collection of key frames is known as a storyboard. The storyboards are stored in an annotation
6.4. DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS                                                                             103

database that is much smaller in size than the original video database. Typically the user of
a video browsing system has the ability to preview the storyboard and select shots from it to
view. This example shows the data flow for such a system.

    The data processing is readily apparent from the DFD. Videos in the database are processed
to extract shot boundaries and key frames, which are stored in the annotation database. The
user can submit requests to view a storyboard, which is retrieved from the annotation database.
When a shot is selected from the storyboard, the users can preview the original shot, which is
retrieved from the video database.

    There are a few important points to note about DFDs. They are solution independent,
specifying the behavior based upon data flow. Specific information on the data flows is defined
in a formal language known as a data dictionary (it is not covered here). There can be
concurrent processes represented in a DFD. In the video browsing example, multiple people
can use the system simultaneously, and there is no implied sequencing between when the shot
boundary detection process is run and the storyboards are previewed. It is clear that the video
must undergo shot detection prior to viewing its storyboard. This information is listed in
something known as an event table. The event table for this example is shown in Table 6.4.
104              CHAPTER 6. SYSTEM DESIGN II: BEHAVIOR MODELS

                 Table 6.4: Event table for the video browsing system.

    An event is an occurrence at a specific time and place that needs to be remembered. Events
can be classified into temporal, external, and state. A temporal event is one which happens
because the system has reached some critical time. In this example, the generation of shot
boundaries could occur for all new videos in the database at a specified time each day, but in
this case it occurs whenever a new video is added to the database. An external event occurs
outside the system boundary by a system user, in this case requesting either a storyboard or a
video preview. A state event is the result of something changing within the system. Associated
with each event is a trigger, the cause of the event. Each event has a process that is associated
with it. Finally, associated with each event is a source, the entity responsible for triggering it.

6.5 Entity Relationship Diagrams

A database is a system that stores and retrieves data, and it is modeled by an entity re-
lationship diagram (ERD). The intention of an ERD is to catalog a set of related objects
(entities), their attributes, and the relationships between them. The entities and their relation-
ships are real distinct things that have characteristics that need to be captured. The design
of a database starts by describing the entities, their attributes, and the relationship between
entities in an ERD. In order to ask meaningful questions about the data, the entities need to
be related to one another. For example, a list of students and a list of courses by themselves
have limited utility. However, by introducing a relationship between these two entities we can
ask questions such as "How many students are taking the Microelectronics course? " The three
elements used in the ERD modeling language are:

   1. Entities. They are generally in the form of tangible objects, roles played, organizational
       units, devices, and locations. An instance is the manifestation of a particular entity. For
       example, an entity could be Student while an instance would be Kristen.

   2. Relationships. They are descriptors for the relationships between entities.

   3. Attributes. They are features that are used to differentiate between instances of the
       entities.

    Lets consider an ERDs describing academic life at a college . The process typically starts
by interviewing the end-users and identifying the entities and their attributes. Assume that
the result of this process is that the college wants to store data about three entities: Students,
Courses, and Departments. The process of building an ERD starts by determining the rela-
tionships between entities. One way to do this is to build an entity relationship matrix
as shown in Table 6.5. The entities constitute both the row and column headings, and the
matrix entries represent the relationship, if any, that exists between entities. This is similar to
the pairwise comparison matrix in Chapter 2 where user needs were systematically compared.
Relationships are bi-directional because they have two participating entities.
6.6. THE UNIFIED MODELING LANGUAGE                                 105

            Table 6.5: Entity relationship matrix.

                          site for many
                          offers many

    From Table 6.5 we can see that a Student can take many courses and a Course has many
students in the Student-Course relationship. A cardinality ratio, associated with each rela-
tionship, describes the multiplicity of the entities in a relationship. For example, the Student-
Course relationship is many-to-many, or M:M, because one student can take many courses and
one course is taken by many students. The relationship between Student and Department
is M:1 since a Department enrolls many students, but a student can major in only one De-
partment. A recursive relationship, prerequisite, exists between the Course entity and itself
because a course may have many other courses as prerequisites and may be the prerequisite for
many other courses. Thus the prerequisite relationship has an M:M cardinality. It needs to be
noted that in this example the needs of the college required relationships between all pairs of
entities. If, for example, the college did not need to keep track of the students' majors, then the
relationship between Student and Department would be left blank in the entity relationship
matrix.

    The resulting ERD is shown in Figure 6.6. The relationships are identified by the diamonds
shaped symbols; the entities are denoted by the rectangles with their name at the top. The
cardinality ratio is labeled on the links between the relationships and entities. Another piece
of information shown in the ERD is the attributes associated with each entity. An attribute is
a feature or characteristic of an entity that needs to be remembered. There are many different
types of attributes; however, the most important are key attributes (which are underlined)
which uniquely identify instances. For example, the identification number (ID) attribute of a
Student is a key attribute.

    The ERD allows for an easy interpretation of the relationships between entities as well
as their attributes. Although beyond the scope of the discussion here, the ERD is a formal
language that can be used to automatically generate the database structure. The relationships
in the ERD allow queries to be asked of the resulting database. For example, the college could
derive a student's course schedule from the database from the relationship between Student
and Course.

6.6 The Unified Modeling Language

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created to capture the best practices of the
object-oriented software development process. However, it has valuable modeling tools that
can be applied more generally to ECE systems. The objective of this section is to provide an
overview of UML and the six different system views that it encompasses. A caveat for the
reader--UML is complex, and complete coverage is beyond the scope of this book. In order
to fully understand its subtleties and nuances, the reader is advised to consult the references
provided in Section 6.8.

    In order to aid in the explanation of the different views we will create a UML model of a
system called the Virtual Grocer, or v-Grocer for short. The v-Grocer enables a user to order

groceries from home and have them delivered. The concept is to provide users with a barcode
scanner that is connected to their home computer along with application software. When the
user runs out of an item, he/she scans in the Universal Product Code (UPC). When users want
to order groceries, they connect to the Internet, log into the grocery store web server, enter
the quantity for the scanned items, and place their order. Once the order is completed, they
are billed and the groceries are delivered to their houses at a prearranged time.

Static View

Object-oriented design (OOD) is fundamentally different from functional software design in
that it emphasizes objects instead of functions. Objects represent both data (attributes) and
the methods (functions) that can act upon the data. An object represents a particular instance
of something known as a class, which defines the attributes and methods. An object encapsu-
lates all of this information. The data and methods that an object encapsulates are available
only to that object by default. Thus, other objects cannot change that state of an object
6.6. THE UNIFIED MODELING LANGUAGE  107

unless given specific permission to do so. This improves the reliability and maintainability of
software systems, because changes made to the internal representation of a class are not seen
by methods outside of the class.

    The intention of the static view is to show the classes in a system and their relationships.
The static view is characterized by a class diagram. A very simple class diagram with a single
class is shown in Figure 6.4. The specification of a class has three parts, a name, a list of
attributes, and a set of methods. The name of the class for this example is Customer and
it has three attributes: Name, Address, and CustId. It has one method associated with it,
ChangeAddr(), which can change the Address attribute. A class, just like an entity in an ERD,
is a generalization of a set of a particular thing or instance. For example, the Customer class
could have a particular instance called Ms. Robinson.

                                                                    Customer
                                                            -Name : string
                                                            -Address : string
                                                            -CustId : long
                                                            +ChangeAddr() : bool

Figure 6.4: Class diagram notation. The class has a label (Customer), attributes (Name,
Address, and CustId), and methods (ChangeAddr()).

    Classes are related to one another by relationships that define how classes interact with
each other. For example, if a class is a subset of another class (a kind of relation) then the
subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass. In UML, there are a host
of relationships; among these are generalization, composition, and associations. Two classes
are related by a generalization relationship when one is a subset of the other. Two classes are
related by a composition relationship when one is composed of members of the other. Two
classes are related by an association relationship whenever they need to send messages to one
another. Relationships are drawn as lines connecting the two participant classes. The terminals
of the line have different shapes depending on the type of relationship. Just like an ERD, the
relationships between classes have cardinality defined by the rule base. In order to illustrate
these points, Figure 6.5 shows the class diagram for a portion of the v-Grocer system.

    The class diagram has five classes--Customer, Delivery, Order, Item, and GroceryCart.
The GroceryCart class is derived from the many-to-many relationship which exists between
the Order and Item classes. Just like the rules for an ERD, the cardinality of a relationship is
read at the end of the association in which it is involved. The only difference is that the many
cardinality in a class diagram is denoted by a * symbol. For example, a delivery is sent to one
customer, while a customer may receive many deliveries.

Use-Case View

The intention of the use-case view is to capture the overall behavior of the system from the
user's point of view and to describe cases in which the system will be used. It is characterized
by a use-case diagram, and an example for the v-Grocer is shown in Figure 6.6. There are
only two symbols employed in a use-case diagram, actors and use-cases. Actors, drawn as stick
figure people, are idealized people or systems that interact with the system. For this example
the actors are customers, delivery people, the database, clerks, and the web server. Use-cases
are drawn as ovals in the diagram, and in this example, they are WebOrder, DeliverOrder, and
AssembleOrder. A use-case is a particular situation when actors use the system and is usually
represented by a sequence of actions that will be performed by the system. This sequence

     +TotalCost() : float

                Figure 6.5: Class diagram for the v-Grocer.

of actions typically represents a high level of functionality. Every actor that interacts with a
particular use-case is connected to it with a line. Finally, the entire collection of use-cases is
enclosed in a rectangle with the actors outside. This rectangle represents the system boundary
and consequently is labeled with the name of the system.

                Figure 6.6: Use-case diagram for the v-Grocer.

    From Figure 6.6 it is apparent that a Customer, the WebServer, and Database interact
when creating a WebOrder. Use-cases are often described in a table as shown for this particular
example in Table 6.7.

    Use-cases focus on a very high level of functionality and describe who will interact with the
system and how they will interact. Given their high level of abstraction, they can easily be
incorporated into a variety of ECE projects. They are also simple and easy to understand and

thus can be incorporated into presentations to non-technical audiences. Finally, use-cases are
simply not busy work--they are fundamental to the development of other UML models.

State Machine View

The state machine view is characterized by a state diagram as was discussed in Section 6.2.
Again, the intention of a state diagram is to describe systems with memory. Figure 6.7 shows
the state view of a customer logging into the v-Grocer web server.

                           Present login    ! loaded

                                    loaded

             ! recognized  Read password ! enter
                                        enter

                           Query server     ! respons

                           Order page

             Figure 6.7: State diagram for the v-Grocer customer login.

Activity View

The intention of the activity view, characterized by an activity diagram, is to describe the
sequencing of processes required to complete a task. In UML, the tasks elaborated are the
individual use-cases identified in a use-case diagram. Since more than one actor may be involved
in completing a task, an activity diagram can express the concurrent nature of tasks. An
activity diagram is composed of states, transitions, forks, and joins. Figure 6.8 contains an
activity diagram for the v-Grocer order delivery system. The diagram gives a clear visual
picture for the activities that need to be completed for an order to be packed and delivered.
After a complete order is placed, the flow is forked into two concurrent processing branches.
One of these branches is for completion of the order, while the other addresses its scheduling,
110                            CHAPTER 6. SYSTEM DESIGN II: BEHAVIOR MODELS

delivery, and coordination with other deliveries. When both of those processes are completed,
they are joined together and then the delivery run is made.

     Figure 6.8: Activity diagram for order processing and delivery for the v-Grocer.

Interaction View

The intention of the interaction view is to show the interaction between objects. It is
characterized by collaboration and sequence diagrams. In an object-oriented system, tasks are
completed by passing messages between objects. The interaction view shows how messages are
exchanged in order to accomplish a task. These tasks are usually the use-cases. Since messages
are sent through time, the interaction view must be able to express the concept of order. We
start by examining collaboration diagrams.

    Two objects collaborate together in order to produce some meaningful result. A collabo-
ration diagram shows the sequencing of messages that are exchanged between classes in order
to complete a task. It consists of the classes that participate in the realization of the task
and the messages exchanged. The messages are drawn as arrows from the sending object to
the receiving object. The message arrows are labeled with the name of the message and its
numerical position in the sequence of messages exchanged to realize the task. For example,
Figure 6.9 shows how the WebOrder use-case is realized using the Customer, WebServer, and
Database classes. Note, WebServer and Database are introduced as new classes and are not
shown as part of the class diagram in Figure 6.9.

     Figure 6.9: Collaboration diagram for the WebOrder use-case.

    The collaboration diagram is similar in form to the class diagram, the difference being
that the relationships are annotated with the messages that are exchanged. Consequently, the
collaboration diagram aides the developers in understanding and implementing the methods
used between classes. In order to emphasize the order in which messages are exchanged, a
developer can also use a sequence diagram.

    A sequence diagram contains the same information as the corresponding collaboration di-
agram. Where the collaboration diagram emphasizes the objects that interact to produce a
behavior, a sequence diagram emphasizes the message order that produces a behavior. As
shown in Figure 6.10, the classes that participate in the behavior are listed in a row at the top
of the diagram. From each class a dotted vertical line is drawn downward that represents the
6.6. THE UNIFIED MODELING LANGUAGE                                      111

lifeline of its class (the vertical axis represents time). When an object is actively requesting or
waiting for information from another object, a rectangle is drawn over the dotted lifeline of the
object. The message is drawn as an arrow from the sending object to the receiving object and
labeled with the name of the message. The activity diagrams can be applied generally to ECE
systems to show the interaction between entities, particularly the sequencing of messages.

Physical View

The intention of the physical view is to demonstrate the physical components of the system
and how the logical views map to them. The physical view is characterized by a component and
deployment diagram. A component diagram shows the software files and the interrelationships
that make up the system. Software files are shown in rectangles. Lines connect together files
that need to communicate. A deployment diagram shows the hardware and communications
components that will be used to realize the system. The hardware components are drawn as
cubes and labeled with their names. Figure 6.11 shows a combined component and deployment
diagram for the v-Grocer system. The software files are the Browser, v-Grocer, Apache, and
Oracle, while the hardware components are the Customer, WebServer, and Database.

112  CHAPTER 6. SYSTEM DESIGN II: BEHAVIOR MODELS

6.7 Project Application: Selecting Models

Chapters 5 and 6 have presented a variety of models for representing the behavior of systems.
The design team needs to select the correct combination of tools to properly describe a design
for its eventual implementation. Table 6.8 provides a summary of the models and their different
intentions.

6.8 Summary and Further Reading

Models provide a convenient method of describing a system at a high level of abstraction. This
allows a system to be described without having to determine all of the implementation details.
All models are not the same--they come in a variety of forms and each is designed to serve a
different intention. The properties of effective models were presented, and we saw that they are
similar to those of an engineering requirement. Models should encourage innovation by allowing
the exploration of alternative implementations. Since models are built from abstractions of the
actual system components, they are an effective means for communicating with non-technical
stakeholders. Finally, models provide an excellent means of documenting the development of
a design from the highest level down to the detailed design.

    This chapter presented a variety of models for describing system behavior that included
state diagrams, flowcharts, data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, and the Unified
Modeling Language. Table 6.8 provides a quick reference that describes the intention and
application of the models examined in both Chapters 5 and 6.

    Flowcharts have been around for quite some time and an early work describing them is
Flowcharts by Chapin [Cha71]. The book Programming Logic and Design [Far02] covers
flowcharts extensively and their application in programming. State diagrams are fundamental
to the ECE field and further information on them is available in virtually any introductory
digital design textbook. Data flow diagrams and entity relationship diagrams are common
tools used in information systems analysis and design and can be further explored in Systems
Analysis and Design [Sat02] and Fundamentals of Database Systems [Elm94]. Two references
for UML are The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual [Rum98] and
Schaum's Outline of UML [Ben01].

                                a DFD requires the designer to carefully think about the uses of
                                the system and how the system is to react to external users and

                                The intention of UML is to describe complex software systems.
                                However, certain views are well suited to describing systems at a
                                high level and are applicable to many domains. The process of
                                viewing a system from the six perspectives listed below decreases
                                the chances that crucial details of the design will be overlooked.

                                and are not easily accessible to a non-technical audience. See
                                Section 6.6.

                                This is essentially the same as the state diagram, but is also a

6.9 Problems

   1. Why is it important for a model to separate the design of a system from its realization?

   2. Classify each of the following as either a model, not a model, or sometimes a model.
       Justify your answer based on the definition and properties of a model.

            A diagram of a subway system,
            a computer program,
            a football play,
            drivers license,
            a floor plan of the local shopping mall (a "you are here" diagram).,
            an equation,
            A scratch n' sniff perfume advertisement in a fashion magazine,
            The 1812 overture,

            sheet music for the Brandenburg Concerto,
            the United States Constitution,
            a set of car keys,
            the ASCII encoding of an email message.

   3. Which of the following systems has memory? Justify your answer using the concepts of
       input, output, and state.

            an ink pen,
            a resistor,
            a capacitor,
            a motorized garage door,
            an analog wrist watch,
            the air pressure in an air compressor,
            the thermostat which controls the furnace in a house,
            a light switch,
            a political system,
            the temperature of a large lake,
            a book,
            a computer's hard drive.

   4. A can of soda has memory. Your objective is to figure out what characteristic of the can
       is the state variable and what input causes it to change. Based upon this, draw a state
       diagram for a can of soda. Label the transition arcs with the input responsible for the
       transition. Hint: no special equipment is needed to elicit the change of state.
6.9. PROBLEMS  115

5. Consider the state diagram for the vending machine shown in Table 6.1. Now assume
   that the system accepts nickels, dimes, and quarters. Also assume that it is capable of
   returning change to the user after a purchase. Create a state diagram that represents
   this new system. Make sure to define the output signals and their value for each state.

6. Use a state diagram to describe the high level operation of the ChipMunk Recorder
   (CMR). The CMR records sounds and then plays them back at a variety of speeds,
   making a recorded voice sound like a high pitched chipmunk. The CMR receives user
   input from a keyboard and an audio source. The behavior of the system is described as
   follows:

        When powered up, the CMR enters a wait state.

        If 'R' is pressed the recorder begins recording.

        Any key-press will put the CMR back into the wait state.

        If 'S' is pressed, the CMR is ready to change the playback speed. A subsequent
          numerical input between 1 and 5 will cause the playback speed to be changed to
          that value.

        Pressing the 'R' key when in the adjust playback speed mode will cause the CMR
          to go to the wait state.

        Pressing a 'P' key will cause the CMR to playback the recorded sounds. When
          done playing the entire recording, the CMR will loop back and start playing at the
          beginning.

        Any key-press while in the playback mode will cause the CMR to go back into the
          wait state.

   Draw a state diagram describing the behavior of the CMR. Create a table which lists
   every state and its associated output.

7. Build a state diagram to describe the state of the tape cartridges used to backup a
   company's network drives. When new unformatted cartridges are received they are
   immediately labeled with a unique ID. Before a tape is used it is formatted turning it
   into a blank tape. On the first day of the week a complete backup is made of the
   network drives, transforming blank tapes into active tapes. The active tapes, made
   every fourth week, are moved off site making them archival tapes. Active tapes older
   than 3 months are assumed to have out of date information and are reformatted into
   blank tapes. Archival tapes more than 2 years old are reformatted and put back into
   circulation.

8. Build a flowchart to describe the operation of a microcontroller (MCU) based temperature
   regulating system. The system monitors the temperature of a heated environment using
   thermistors and regulates the temperature by turning fans on to cool the environment.
   The MCU periodically reads the temperature from each of the 64 different thermistors
   (each is driven by its own constant current source) by selecting each through an analog
   multiplexor. The voltage is converted into an 8-bit digital value using the MCU's analog-
   to-digital converter. If any of the 64 thermistors exceeds a high temperature threshold,
   the MCU uses a complex algorithm to determine the number of fans to turn on, otherwise
   all the fans are turned off.

   statements.

10. Create a flowchart that outlines how to crochet a two-tone blanket with a diagonal stripe
     across it as shown below. A blanket is crocheted by linking together a sequence of basic
     stitches. For the purposes of the flowchart assume that a basic stitch is an elaborate
     process. Basic stitches are made from either dark or light yarn. The blanket should be
     100 stitches wide by 150 stitches high. The diagonal stripe runs at a 45 degree angle
     from the horizontal.

11. Build a data flow diagram and event table to represent an image archiving system for
     an art museum. The art museum maintains a database of digital images of paintings
     from museums all over the world. The following information is known about the image
     database system:

          Images are shared among museums in a participating network. Whenever a partic-
            ipating museum posts a new image, it sends a broadcast email to all participating
            museums in the network with the image attached as an email. It provides the name
            of the painting and artist in the body of the email. All new images received are
            added directly to the museum's own image database.

          When inserted into the museum's database, each image is provided with a tag
            identifying the name of the painting and the artist. Furthermore, this triggers an
            image analysis routine that classifies the image based into predefined categories such
            as portrait, natural scene, and modern. Furthermore, it stores key features that are
            extracted from the image.

          The key features are used to identify and retrieve visually similar images from the
            museum's database. Another image processing algorithm is run that compares the
            visual similarity of the new image to all images in the database. This process
            produces a matching score of 0 to 100 that is stored.

          The museum's image database is available to visitors via computer kiosks placed
            throughout the museum. Kiosk users can retrieve and view images in one of three
6.9. PROBLEMS  117

            ways. First, they can specify the name of the artist or painting. Second, they
            can retrieve a class of images, such as modern. Third, once they have received a
            painting, they can submit a request to view visually similar images. The visually
            similar images are retrieved for viewing based upon the matching score.

12. Build an ERD to keep track of the bicycle frames manufactured at a local company. The
     following are notes from an interview with the owner.

            We custom build bike frames to the dimension of each individual customer.
            When a customer comes in we take measurements in their height, leg length,
            arm length, torso length, weight, and waist measurement. Since we have
            high customer satisfaction our customers order new frames every several year.
            Hence we would like to date these measurements in order to track how a cus-
            tomer's body changes through time .Each frame is built on one set of measure-
            ments. Clearly, we need to keep track of our customer's contact information
            like name, address, phone number, and email address. We would like to know
            which employee built which frame. We would like to store basic information
            like name, address, phone, and SSN for each employee. Each frame is built
            by one employee using a variety of different titanium tubing. We have strict
            inventory control on all of our tubing and need to keep track of its grade, lot
            #, Outer Diameter (OD), Inner Diameter (ID), and manufacturer. Tubing is
            uniquely identified by its lot #. Finally we need to keep information on the
            frame. Each frame is given a unique serial number, and has a color, type, and
            dimensions.

13. Extend Problem 7 to create an ERD that captures data about the tape cartridges used
     in the backup system. Every Sunday night a full backup is made of all network drives.
     A full backup creates an identical copy of the network drives on the tape cartridges. Due
     to the large amount of information, a full backup requires many tapes. On the other
     nights of the week an incremental backup is made. An incremental backup stores only
     files modified since the last backup (either full or incremental). Incremental backups are
     much smaller than a full backup, and consequently many incremental backups fit on a
     single tape. A tape contains only full or incremental backup information - the unused
     portion of the last tape used for a full backup is never used to store incremental backups.
     Your company wants to keep track of tapes, full backups, and incremental backups. An
     ID and state should be tracked for each tape. For full backups, the system needs to track
     the creation date and the number of tapes used. For an incremental backup it should
     track the date it was made. The relationships between the backup type and the tape will
     capture which tapes participated in which backup. (Hint: the state of a tape should be
     an attribute of the tape entity - unformatted, blank, etc. They are not attributes and
     are possible values for the state attribute.)

Testing

       A stitch in time saves nine.--Anonymous
    Most systems undergo testing throughout their development and before they are delivered
to the customer. Clearly, systems should be tested to ensure that they meet the engineering
requirements. In fact, one of the desirable properties of an engineering requirement is that it
be verifiable, or in other words, testable. The philosophy of testing is embodied in the quote
above, which means that it is better to correct errors early, rather than wait until they become
much larger problems later. As we saw in Chapter 1, the cost to correct problems increases
exponentially with the lifetime of the project. Thus, testing should be considered throughout
system development.
    Testing means different things to different people. A field service technician, assembly line
worker, and designer will have their own definitions and requirements from a test. In this
chapter testing is examined from the perspective of a systems designer intent on checking
that the system meets the engineering requirements. Along the way fundamental testing
concepts like controllability and observability are explored. Approaches to debugging systems
are provided, followed by templates for building unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance
tests.

7.1 Testing Principles

The design process is really a continual increase in specificity from engineering requirements
to the detailed design. We now consider the question of how to test that the resulting system
meets the design requirements. One answer is based on a common testing model, the "test
vee", shown in Figure 7.1. This model starts with the engineering requirements, proceeds to
the implementation, and then onto testing. It emphasizes that every level of design has a
corresponding level of test. What is not so clear from this model is that the testing process
is actually split between the two halves of the test vee. Students typically think of testing as
being exclusively confined to the right half of the test vee - build it then you test it. However,
each test performed in the right half of the test vee must be carefully engineered during the
development of the system in the left side of the test vee. An acceptance test plan should be
written with the Requirements Specification, integration tests defined and written during the
system design, and so forth.

    In our enthusiasm to complete a project many of us all too often rely on a "smoke test" -
turn on a system to see if it works. The name of this test is a reference to what may happen to
the system if the test fails - it burns up and smokes. Beyond being a potentially expensive way
to test a system, a smoke test is not a systematic approach to verify that the system behaves
as expected. Customer are not be impressed with "hey it didn't catch on fire!" as the test
result. Clear tests need to be developed because:

     The test cases define exactly what the module must do.
     Testing prevents feature creep, since the development of a module is complete when its

       test is passed.

     Test cases motivate developers by providing immediate feedback.
     Test cases force designers to think about extreme cases.
     Test cases are a form of documentation.
     Test cases force the designer to consider the design of the module before building it.
7.1. TESTING PRINCIPLES  121

    The test suite and its accompanying documentation contain important information about
the behavior and organization of a system and its module. This gives tests a value beyond
a role in showing that the system and its modules do not fail the tested conditions. The
individual test cases show others engineers how to properly interface to a module, making that
module more reusable. In addition, test documents can be used by other individuals in the
organization like technical writers, maintenance technicians, and technical trainers.

    How should testing be done? Given enough time, a system could be tested by simply
enumerating every conceivable input and observing the outputs. While in some cases this
might be possible, in general it would take an unreasonable amount of time to perform such a
test. Instead, tests are crafted in order to maximize the likelihood of finding errors.

Types of Testing, Observability, and Controllability

Tests fall into two general types--black box and white box tests. Black box tests are those
that are performed without any knowledge of the systems internal organization. In a black
box test, the testing is typically conducted by changing the inputs and comparing the system
outputs to their expected values. The input and output values can be classified as typical,
boundary, extreme, and invalid. These categories are illustrated by considering a system
which converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit. Typical inputs are values experienced
during normal operation, say room temperature. Boundary values are encountered whenever
the input or output changes in some significant way. For example, 0°C and -33.3°C mark the
transition between positive to negative temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit respectively.
Absolute zero represents an extreme value, because things can't get any colder. While these
tests could be accomplished by enumerate every possible input to the system and observing
the output, this would take an unreasonable amount of time. Hence, the test writer must
elect candidate inputs to represent the behavior of the system over a range of possible inputs.
An important goal of the test writer is to minimize the number of these equivalence classes
while maximizing coverage of the input domain. Without a clear understanding of the internal
organization of the system this is a challenging goal.

    White box tests are conducted with knowledge of the internal working of the system. The
idea of white box testing is to build tests which target specific internal nodes of the system to
check that they are operating as expected. The tests should be written to check the node can
handle typical, boundary, extreme and illegal situations.

    One of the many goals in designing a system is to increase its testability. A design is
testable when a failure of a component or subsystem can be quickly located. A testable
design is easier to debug, manufacture, and service in the field. One way to increase the
testability of a system is to increase controllability and observability. Controllability is the
ability to set any node of the system to a prescribed value. Observability is the ability to
observe any node of a system. In black box testing, both controllability and observability are
low. In white box testing, controllability and observability may be higher depending on the
design.

    Let's examine this further via the example of a simple transistor amplifier shown in Fig-
ure 7.2. The purpose of this circuit, known as the common-emitter amplifier, is to amplify the
input signal, vi, to produce a linearly proportional output signal, vo = Axvi. The rectangular
boundary in the figure represents a black box view of the system. In this view, the system
power, Vcc, and ground would be applied to activate the circuit. The black box testing would
consist of checking supply and ground voltages, varying the input signal, and observing the
output signal. Again, this is a low controllability and low observability situation.
122                                            CHAPTER 7. TESTING

    White box testing utilizes knowledge of the internal workings of the design. When designing
a transistor amplifier, there are two major points to consider--the DC bias voltages in the
circuit and its AC, or time varying, amplification behavior. The two behaviors are related
since the AC behavior depends upon proper DC biasing of the circuit. During detailed circuit
design, the expected DC voltages for different nodes in the circuit would be determined. Thus,
a white box test would consist of first checking the power supply and ground voltages as
was done in the black box case. The next step would be different in that the node voltages
(VB, VC , VE) would be checked to see if they meet the expected design values. This indicates a
high degree of observability. However, the controllability is not significantly better than in the
black box case. This is because the internal DC node voltages in the circuit cannot arbitrarily
be changed without negatively changing the operation of the circuit.

Stubs

A stub is a device that is used to simulate a subcomponent of a system. This might be done
for two reasons, either the subcomponent has not yet been built, or the risk of damaging
the subcomponent warrants using a stand-in. Typically, stubs are used to simulate inputs or
monitor outputs of the unit under test (UUT). Both hardware and software stubs can be
used when designing a system. In software testing stub routines are developed to either call
other functions or act as those to be called by the unit under test.

    Consider a hardware example, the transistor amplifier in Figure 7.2. Assume that the circuit
is ultimately to be integrated into a larger system. The input to this system is a time-varying
source with certain resistive and capacitive characteristics, while the output is connected to
another system with a known input resistance range. The stubs used for testing in this system
are shown in Figure 7.3. On the input side is a function generator, an off-the-shelf component,
connected to a resistor and capacitor that models the expected characteristics of the final
system. The stub on the output side is simply a resistor, whose value can be varied over the
expected load.

Test Case Properties
As we go through the different levels of testing we will need to build effective test cases.
Effective test cases share some common attributes regardless of their level. Dianne Runnels
[Run99] defined the following properties for effective test cases:

     Accurate. The test should check what it is supposed to and exercise an area of intent.

     Economical. The test should be performed in a minimal number of steps.

     Limited in complexity. Tests should consist of a moderate number (10-15) of steps.

     Repeatable. The test should be able to be performed and repeated by another person.

     Appropriate. The complexity of the test should be such that it is able to be performed
       by other individuals who are assigned the testing task.

     Traceable. The test should verify a specific requirement. The corresponding requirements
       for the different types of test are derived from the associated development stages in the
       test vee in Figure 7.1.

     Self cleaning. The system should return to the pre-test state after the test is complete.

7.2 Constructing Tests

This section presents the four different types of test shown in Figure 7.1 - debugging, unit
testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing. This is presented in reverse order from the
order in which test should be created, as the reader is probably most familiar with basic test
techniques such as debugging. Thus the presentation is from the most familiar to the more
abstract. The next section presents a case study that proceeds in the opposite direction from
acceptance testing to unit testing.
124  CHAPTER 7. TESTING

Debugging

At some point in the design process, the implementation level must be reached, where tasks
such as constructing circuits, wiring integrated circuits, and writing code are carried out.
Applying the functional decomposition paradigm introduced in Chapter 5 should provide a
clear idea of the inputs, outputs, and behavior of the modules that are being built. Inevitably,
there will come a point during the construction of a component when it will not function as
expected. This is commonly referred to as a bug. It requires the application of debugging
skills to determine the root cause of the problem and correct it. You have undoubtedly run
across a variety of bugs in your day, and it is a good guess that your bugs fell into one of two
camps--Bohrbugs and Heisenbugs.

    Bohrbugs are named after the Bohr model of the atom that assumes that electrons have
a distinct position in space. Bohrbugs are reliable bugs, in which the error is always in the
same place. This is analogous to the electrons having a definite position. Given a particular
input, a Bohrbug will always manifest itself in the same way and in the same place. Finding a
Bohrbug is a matter of laying the correct trap. A good trap is simple to set-up, quickly causes
an error, and reveals the source of the error. This is a tall order, but one which experience
hones.

    Heisenbugs are named after the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, in which the position
of an electron is uncertain. Analogously, Heisenbugs may not always be reproducible with the
same input. They seemingly move around within a system and are consequently difficult to
locate. Finding a Heisenbug requires you to think outside the box because they usually result
from unanticipated mechanisms. An example of a Heisenbug is a computer program with a
pointer error that occasionally overwrites the system stack. This can cause return values from
a subroutine to be incorrect. In such a case, the subroutine would appear to have a problem,
since it is returning the wrong value. However, testing the subroutine by itself would confirm
that the subroutine works properly. Another good example is a circuit that works fine on some
days, but doesn't work on others (typically when a professor is nearby). Insidious problems
such as a floating ground line often are to blame.

    Regardless of the bug type, the debugging process is iterative. You must run tests and
depending on the results, go back and run new tests. With this in mind, you should enter into
the debugging process with a strategy in mind. This strategy is often similar to programming
an if-then structure--"if the test is negative, then I'll pursue this line of attack; otherwise the
error could be in another subsystem." In general, the debugging process is much the same as
the scientific method. The steps of the debugging process are:

     Observe. Observe the problem under different operating conditions.

     Hypothesize. Form a hypothesis as to what the potential problem is.

     Experiment. Conduct experiments to confirm or eliminate the hypothesized source of
       the problem.

     Repeat. Repeat until the problem is eliminated.

    When hypothesizing, make sure to check the simplest and easiest potential problems first.
There are two good reasons for this--they are easy to perform and more tests can be performed
in a given period of time. In addition, designs should be verified from the lowest levels of
abstraction to the highest. For example, voltages should be verified as correct before moving
to higher levels of functionality. The reason for this heuristic is obvious--the higher level of
functionality cannot operate correctly unless all the lower levels are working.
7.2. CONSTRUCTING TESTS  125

Unit Testing

A unit test is a complete test of a module's functionality. In order to be a complete check,
a unit test consists of a set of test cases each of which establishes that the module performs
a single unit of functionality to some specification. Test cases should be written with the
express intent of uncovering undiscovered defects. For example, consider a hardware module
which converts an input Celsius temperature into an output Fahrenheit temperature. Let the
operation of the module be represented by the following pseudo-code.

if (16 < input < 32)
      output = ROM[input -16];

else
      output = (2 * input) + 32;

    When the input temperature is between 16 and 32, the output is determined by a lookup
operation in a ROM, otherwise the input is converted using an approximation to the familiar
Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion. Each test case for this hardware module should exercise a
single area of intent. Clearly, we need to have at least two test cases, one for the "if" clause and
one for the "else" clause. In addition, it would be a good idea to check the boundary conditions
separating the "if" and "else" clauses. Finally, we should consider the extreme values of the
input. For example, if the input were a signed 8-bit number then we should check -128, and
128. If the input is a signed value then 0 is also a boundary value that should be checked.

    This example illustrates the concept of a processing path - a sequence of consecutive
instructions or states encountered from the beginning to the end of a computation pr process.
The temperature conversion example has two processing paths, one where the "if" statement
is taken and one when the "else" statement is taken. Each such processing path through the
system represents a potential test case. The extent to which the test cases cover all possible
processing paths is called the test coverage. It is desirable to design test sets that have the
highest coverage as possible in the fewest number of test cases. The ultimate in coverage is
achieved by path-complete coverage where every possible path has a test. However this level
of coverage may not be possible because the number of processing paths goes up exponentially
with the number of nested branches. In cases where there are more paths than it is possible to
check, you must be satisfied with partial path coverage. In such cases, those paths that which
are though to most likely reveal an error should be tested.

    Clearly documenting unit tests has added importance because the test cases are generally
written by one person or group and performed by a separate group. In order to organize the
test cases they can be organized as matrices, step-by-step tests or automated scripts.

Matrix Tests

A matrix test is a test that is best suited to cases where the inputs submitted are structurally
the same and differ only in their values. The test procedure is then "factored out" leaving a list
of inputs and their expected outputs. Since the tests are written by one group and performed by
another the test writer must leave space in the test document for the tester to make comments
and observations regarding the system behavior.

    Lets consider a test for the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that was used in the temper-
ature measuring system described in Table 5.13. Assume that the ADC's clock frequency is 10
kHz and the input ranges from 0 to 5 volts. The unit test will consist of submitting different
inputs to the ADC and verifying the outputs. Since each test only varies the input, with no
change in the testing procedure, the test matrix in Table 7.1 was created.
126                                                             CHAPTER 7. TESTING

    This test case exercises each bit of the ADC's output independent of the other output
bits. Other test cases should examine extreme inputs as well as illegal inputs. Care should be
taken that illegal inputs do not stress the ADC beyond the manufactures recommendations;
otherwise the tests might accidentally damage the ADC.

Step-by-Step Tests

A step-by-step test case is a prescription for generating the test and checking the results.
These descriptions are most effective when the test consists of a complex sequence of steps.
The test template for a step-by-step test has the all information contained in the matrix test
template the difference being the addition of a column in the test section describing what
action the tester should perform at each step in the test process.

    As an example, recall the state diagram for the vending machine in Table 6.1 that accepts
nickels and dimes and dispenses candy when a total of $0.25 (or more) is submitted. The state
machine has different processing paths, depending upon the combination and order of coins
deposited. Test cases can be written for each of the processing paths through the system, and
an example is shown in Table 7.2 for one particular processing path.

Automated Test Scripts

An automated test script is a sequence of commands provided to the UUT without user
intervention. The outputs are usually automatically compared against the expected outputs
to determine if the module contains an error. Automated scripts are executed from a device
referred to by many different names like test harness, test fixture, and test bench.

    While automated scripts carry a lot of up front cost in terms of the time required putting
them together they pay dividends when performing regression testing. Regression testing

Overall test result:

is the process of retesting a module following a modification in any related part of the system
to ensure that no errors were inadvertently introduced. Reducing the time spent on regres-
sion testing will has a positive effect on the overall development time. Hence, the benefit of
automated scripts is realized later in the testing cycle. In addition, design decision can have
an effect on the amount of time spent on regression testing. It stands to reason that systems
with highly coupled modules require more extensive and consequently more time consuming
regression testing.

    The template for the matrix tests could be used to describe what an automated test script
does. However, the specifics of how the automated scripts perform these actions are implemen-
tation specific. For example, in hardware description languages the stimulus and responses of
the UUT are processed by a test bench. The test bench is itself a piece of hardware coded in
the same hardware language used to describe the UUT.

Integration Testing

After the individual subsystems have undergone their unit tests, they are then integrated
into large subcomponents leading eventually to the construction of the entire system. Hence
integration testing checks that the major modules of the overall system operate correctly
together. The test cases for integration testing must be traceable to the high-level design, and
128  CHAPTER 7. TESTING

the test cases are written based on characteristics of the design architecture. Test cases for
integration can be derived from the following questions:

     Have all the execution paths through the system been exercised?

     Have all the modules been exercised at least once?

     Have all the interface signals been tested?

     Have all interface modes been exercised?

     Does the system meet timing requirements?

    The integration tests themselves can be documented using either the matrix or step-by-step
template outlined for unit tests.

Acceptance Testing
An acceptance test is a formal document stipulating the conditions under which the customer
will accept the system. It generally consists of a suite of test cases that exercise the systems
according to the user's environment. The test cases are constructed to ensure that the engineer-
ing requirements are met. The four attributes of a good requirement (abstract, unambiguous,
traceable, and verifiable) are important in building a good acceptance test. An unambiguous
requirement will result in a test which everyone can agree on. A verifiable requirement sets
an objective pass/fail criterion on the acceptance test. Tests based on a traceable requirement
imply they are directly assessing the needs of the project. However, an acceptance test goes
far beyond an enumeration of the test cases. It typically includes the following sections:

     Testing Approach. The types, level and methods employed to test the system.

     Test Schedule. Start and end dates for the individual tests.

     Problem Reporting. How the test results will be recorded.

     Resource Requirements. The hardware, software, and people requirements needed to
       perform the tests.

     Test Environment. The setup required to run the tests.

     Test Equipment. Any special equipment or configurations required to run the test.

     Post-Delivery Tests. Tests performed on the deployed system.

     Test Identification. Enumeration of test cases and their unique identifiers.

     Corrective Action. What repairs must be made to the system in order to accept it.

    It is not necessary for every test case to be passed in order for the system to be accepted.
The acceptance test should stipulate the degree of importance surrounding each test. While
it's easy to imagine writing the test cases for an acceptance test, the process can become a
chicken-and-egg problem. That is you are trying to stipulate the test procedures and results
for a system which has yet to be implemented of the system. This can often lead to revisions
of the acceptance test plan later in the design cycle.
7.3. CASE STUDY: SECURITY ROBOT DESIGN  129

7.3 Case Study: Security Robot Design

In order to demonstrate the concepts involved in testing lets consider the design of a security
system which monitors an office complex looking for intruders. The design team has decided to
address the need by designing a mobile robot which autonomously navigates its way through
the office space. The team, along with the customer, developed a number of requirements and
from this we will focus on two that address a fundamental navigational problem.

     The robot's center must stay within 12 to 18 centimeters of the wall over 90% of the
       course, while traveling parallel to a wall over a 3 meter course.

     The robot's heading should never deviate no more than 10 degrees from the wall's axis,
       while traveling parallel to a straight wall over a 3 meter course.

    This case study explores test cases for the acceptance, integration and unit testing related
to these two requirements. The development of the test cases follows the proper order of test
case development illustrated in Figure 7.1. That means acceptance tests are developing in
conjunction with the requirements, integration tests are constructed during the system design,
and unit tests during the system build.

Acceptance Testing

We start by constructing an acceptance test case to verify that the robot can achieve the stated
requirements. A number of tests would need to be built and we create a test only for the first
engineering requirement. A test could be performed by having someone observe the robot
moving along a wall and mark (on the floor) whenever the robot strayed out of bounds. Such
a test would not easily be repeatable because different people might judge what is meant by
"out of bounds" differently. The accuracy of such a test is questionable because determining
when and if a speeding robot crossed the boundary is difficult. Finally, there would be no
permanent record of the test results making it difficult for the customer to actually verify the
test was passed. A way to address these problems is to have the robot monitor its own distance
from the wall. This is done in this case by a program written to monitor the position of the
robot over time and store these values. From the specifications for a step-by-step acceptance
in Table 7.3 it is clear what the test program must configure the robot to log the distance data
while traversing the wall. After this data is downloaded from the robot it can be analyzed in
a spreadsheet program to determine the needed metrics and archived for future reference.

Integration Testing

The team, in consultation with the customer, has gone through the requirements and created
a complete set of acceptance tests in addition to the test in Table 7.3. They next turn to
developing a high level design architecture that can meet the requirements. The design they
create is shown in Figure 7.4, the Level 1 architecture of the autonomous robot.

    The heart of the design is a microcontroller (MCU) which reads the sensor values, makes
decisions, and controls the speed of the two drive motors. The robot moves and turns by
adjusting the relative speed of each motor using a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal from
the MCU. The duty cycle of the PWM is directly proportional to the speed of the motor. The
H-bridges then amplify the MCU output to power to the motors. The MCU also outputs a set
of signals to send text to an LCD. The signal to the digital compass is bidirectional because the
MCU must configure the operating mode of the compass before using it. The MCU receives

an analog input from the range finder, where the voltage level of the signal is proportional to
the distance to the obstacle. Finally, a set of switches are included that allow for manual input
and testing of the robot.

    Clearly, the interaction of the MCU with each of the compass, rangefinder, LCD, switches,
and H-bridges should be examined. However, this will be left to the unit test because the
MCU makes a great test harness which can be used to provide stimulus to and read outputs
from these I/O. In addition, many of the routines from these tests can be reused later in the
development process.

    There are many interactions between subsystems that could be tested during integration
testing. A careful examination of the system must be done to determine which combinations
of subsystems are most likely to create problems. Experience and component selection play a
large part in molding expectations. For example, the magnetic field created by the windings
in the DC motor can affect the reading generated by the compass. This interaction could

potentially affect the headings read by the MCU and cause the robot to go off course by more
than the allowable 10 degrees. Thus a step-by-step integration test is created in Table 7.4 to
test the operation of the motors with the magnetic compass.

    It is clear from this test case that a testing program needs to be written in order to prompt
the user to align the robot, capture compass readings, and then to spool them back to the
user. The requirement that the compass readings deviate no more than 10 degrees is based
on the engineering requirement that the robot deviate no more than 10 degrees from the walls
axis while navigating down the hallway.

Unit Testing

Once the Level 1 architecture is developed and the test cases written to ensure that the archi-
tecture is capable of meeting the design requirements, the design team moves on to selecting
components to use in the design. The design team must select the units so that the resulting
system can meet the engineering requirements. Each of the individual components Figure 7.4
needs to be considered as a candidate for unit testing. In general each functional unit might
have several test cases comprising its unit test. A unit test for the digital compass component
will illustrate this. Prior to presenting the test case, the functional design requirements for the
unit are given in Table 7.5.

    In order to be useful in the overall design the compass module must be able to accurately
report the robot's heading. The requirements place an upper bound of 10 degrees on the error
in the heading of the robot. Thus, the matrix test case is Table 7.6 is constructed to configure
the compass and then reads heading data from it. This unit test looks for heading errors
greater than 10 degrees.

7.4 Guidance

Tests have a lifetime beyond the obvious need to check proper operation of the subsystems,
their integration, and the overall performance of the system. Test cases describe how the
system operates in plain English. Test cases can be used to develop diagnostics, assist in
writing technical documentation, and aid marketing and sales staff in understanding system
performance. Testing is a value-added process in design. Beyond attempting to remove bugs

from the system, Burke and Coyner [Bur03] suggest the following are good reasons to perform
testing:

     Testing reduces the number of bugs in existing and new features. Testing does not elimi-
       nate all the bugs, but rather reduces the probability of a bug making it to production.

     Tests are good documentation. Tests provide insight to others on the operation of the
       unit under test and how to interface to it.

     Tests reduce the costs of change. A change to a complex design with no tests can produce
       bugs that are difficult to track down. A good set of regression tests can help localize the
       effect of bugs introduced by changes.

     Tests improve design. In order to create a testable design, you need to create highly
       cohesive, loosely coupled units.

     Tests allow you to refactor. Subcomponents of a testable design can be changed and
       optimized with less chance of introducing new errors. This is because tests exist that can
       verify the redesigned (refactored) module functions correctly.

     Tests constrain features. When a test is written before building the associated module,
       the exact requirements are defined. Hence, when a unit passes its test, there is confidence
       that the requirements have been met.

     Tests defend against other designers. Often a design needs to have circuitry to deal with
       special cases. Tests that check these special cases can make sure that future modification
       do not remove them.

     Testing is fun. Writing tests requires creative solutions to complex design problems.

     Testing forces you to slow down and think. When writing a test before incorporating
       a feature into a design, you are forced to see how the new feature fits into the existing
       design framework.

     Testing makes development faster. On a component level, testing slows development.
       However, as the design becomes larger and more complex, modules can be more easily
       integrated into the design without causing malfunctions in existing components.

     Tests reduce fear. Would you rather improve a unit with a test suite or one without?

System Reliability

are
       Quality is never an accident. It is always the result of intelligent effort.--John
       Ruskin

    A typical design project in your academic career may never leave the confines of a laboratory.
However, in industry, engineers develop systems that are used by the public at large, and issues
beyond the functionality, such as reliability, safety, and maintainability become important
factors in the success of the design. Over the past 20 years, industry has made a great shift to
address reliability through the adoption of processes such as Quality Functional Deployment
(QFD), Six-Sigma, and Robust Design. While othrefer chapters have addressed some elements
of these processes, the objective of this chapter is to examine system reliability. Reliability
attempts to answer the question of how long a system will operate without failing. Answering
this question has inherent uncertainty and requires the use of probability and statistics. This
chapter presents a review of basic probability theory and applies it to estimate the behavior
of real-world devices. Reliability at the component and system levels is considered.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader should:
     Have a familiarity with the basic principles of probability and understand how they apply
       to reliability theory.
     Understand the mathematical definition and meaning of failure rate, reliability, and mean
       time to failure.
     Understand how to determine the reliability of a component.
     Understand how to derate the power of electronic components for use under different
       operating temperatures.
     Understand how to determine the reliability of different system configurations.

8.1 Probability Theory Review

Probability theory provides a formal framework to study chance events. It is a powerful tool
for modeling engineering systems and is a requisite for reliability estimation. Although this
section provides a review of some important concepts from probability, it is assumed that the
reader is versed in the basics of probability theory.

    In order to apply probability, some general definitions are examined first. An experiment
is the process of measuring or quantifying the state of the world. The particular outcome of
an experiment is an event (ei),while the event space (E) is the set of all possible outcomes
of the experiment. For example, consider an experiment where a six-sided die is rolled. The
experiment is rolling the die and observing the outcome, the event is the particular outcome
observed, and the event space for the experiment is the set E = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The outcomes
do not have to be numerical values. Another example experiment is tossing a coin, in which
case the event space is E = {Heads, T ails}. Both are examples of a discrete event space
because there are a finite number of experimental outcomes. In a discrete event space, the
union of all the possible experimental outcomes defines the event space. If ei is the ith event
in a discrete event space, then the event space is given by the union

     E = ei     (8.1)

    The probability of an event indicates how likely it is for an event to occur. This is quantified
by the probability operator, P , that assigns to each event a real number between 0 and 1. The
probability is the percentage of times that an event would occur if the experiment were repeated
an infinite number of times (the Law of Large Numbers). Two of the three fundamental axioms
on which probability theory is built are

     P (ei)  0  (8.2)

     P (E) = 1  (8.3)

    The first axiom indicates that all probabilities are non-negative, while the second is a
restatement of the event space definition--the outcome of an experiment must be an element
of the event space. Armed with these definitions and axioms, some important concepts from
probability are now examined.

Probability Density Functions

Not all event spaces are discrete as in the case of rolling a die or flipping a coin. Consider
an experiment where the objective is to measure temperature. Clearly, such a measurement
requires a variable having a continuous range of possible values. A random variable is defined
as the outcome of an experiment that has a continuum of possible values. Random variables
have a mathematical function known as the probability density function (PDF) associated with
them, which when integrated, yields the probability of a range of events. A PDF is typically
denoted as pX (x), where X takes values over the event space. Standard notation identifies
random variables using upper case variables as the subscript for the PDF. The variable inside
the parentheses is a lowercase dummy variable that does not have to match the random variable,
but typically does. A question that the PDF allows us to ask is "What is the probability that
a random variable is in some range? " Consider the case where the objective is to determine
the probability that the random variable X lies between two values a and b. Written using
8.1. PROBABILITY THEORY REVIEW                        139

the probability operator, this is indicated as P (a  X  b). It is determined from the PDF as
follows

                                           b          (8.4)

       P (a  X  b) = px(s)dx

                                         a

    Conceptually, this probability represents the area under the PDF between the two limits
of integration as shown in Figure 8.1.

    Let's examine a few more important properties of probability density functions. The first,
which is analogous to Equation 8.3, indicates that the probability of the event space occurring
is equal to one. This is known as the normalization property and it is expressed as

                                                      (8.5)

              px(x)dx = 1

          -

    Another interesting result is obtained by trying to determine the probability that a random
variable takes on an exact value, for example P (X = a). That is determined from the integral

                                   a                  (8.6)

       P (X = a) = px(x)dx = 0

                                 a

    This is a somewhat counterintuitive result--it indicates that the probability a random
variable can take on a particular value is zero. Does this make any sense? Consider an
experiment where the objective is to measure a voltage value for a random variable V . Now
consider the question, "What is the probability that the result of a voltage measurement equals
 (the irrational number) volts? " In practice, this question is impossible to answer because the
precision required of the meter is infinite and contrary to its construction. So the mathematical
and practical results are in harmony. There is a way around this dilemma, which is to determine
the probability that the random variable is within a small range about the target value as
follows

                                +v

       P ( < V <  + v) =            pV dv  pV ()v     (8.7)

                                

    This means that the probability a random variable is within a small range about a given
value is approximated by the product of the PDF evaluated at the value and the size of the
range.

Mean and Variance

Two useful and well-known statistics that are determined from the PDF are the mean (µ) and
variance (2). They are found from the PDF as follows

                         

                   µx =     xpX (x)dx     (8.8)

                         -

                                          (8.9)

                   x2 = (x - µ)2pX (x)dx

                               -

    The mean is analogous to the center of mass of the PDF; it is also known as the average
value. The variance is the average of the squared difference between the mean and the values
of the PDF, where the squared term ensures that a positive difference is taken. The square
root of the variance is known as the standard deviation .

Common Probability Density Functions

There are many PDFs available for describing the seemingly random variations in the behavior
of observed systems and phenomena. In this section, three common PDFs (normal, exponential,
and uniform) are presented.

The Normal Density

The most common density function encountered in the physical sciences and engineering is
the normal density. Many population variations can be described by a normal density. For
example, the resistance values of a large batch of 2.2k ohm resistors would likely follow a
normal density. The normal density is defined as

                           1  1 (x-µ)2
                   pX (x) =  e 2          (8.10)
                         2

    The mean, µ, and standard deviation, , are part of the definition of the PDF and used
to alter the shape of the density to suit the particular need. The normal PDF is plotted in
Figure 8.2. Varying µ allows the overall function to be shifted along the x-axis, while increasing
 spreads (or flattens) the function out. Calculating probabilities from the normal density can
be done (although it takes a bit of work mathematically) so they are usually computed from
something known as the Cumulative Distribution Function that is presented shortly.

                                                                     -  +

The Uniform Density

The uniform density, plotted in Figure 8.2, models the outcome of an experiment where all
outcomes are equally likely. Mathematically, the PDF for a uniform density is given by

                                                      1                  (8.11)
                                        px(x) = b - a , a  x  b,
where a, b are selected to meet the demands of a particular problem.

Figure 8.3: The uniform density on the interval [a, b].

The Exponential Density

Exponential densities are often utilized to model time dependent functions, such as inter-arrival
times between data packets in communication systems. As shown later, the exponential density
also describes the behavior of component failures as a function of time. The mathematical
description of an exponential density is

                px(x) = e-x, x  0,   0.                                  (8.12)

    The PDF is characterized by the parameter  which affects the shape of the curve as
demonstrated in Figure 8.4.

Cumulative Distribution Functions

An important class of questions can be phrased as, "What is the probability that a random
variable X is less than value a?" For example, the objective might be to determine the prob-
ability that an electronic component will malfunction within two years. Returning to the first
question, it is clear that the goal is to determine the probability P (X < a), which is found
by integrating the PDF. This result is generalized by allowing the upper limit of integration
to take on an arbitrary value that spans the range of the random variable. This produces a
new function, known as the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), which is the integral
function of the PDF and is defined as

                                   x

             CDF(x) =                 px(y)dy.                     (8.13)

                                   -

8.2 Reliability Prediction

Our main interest in the study of probability stems from the desire to quantify the reliability
of a system. The following is a formal mathematical definition of reliability.

     Definition: Reliability, R(t), is the probability that a device is functioning properly
     (has not failed) at time t.

    In order to determine R(t), it is necessary to first introduce some related mathematical
entities and their meanings. The failure rate, (t), of a device is the expected number of
failures per unit time. The failure rate is measured by operating a batch of devices for a given
time interval and noting how many fail during that interval. A typical graph of failure rate
versus time has the bathtub shape shown in Figure 8.5. The high initial failure rate is a result of
manufacturing defects often referred to as infant mortality. Consequently, many manufactures
will "burn-in" devices at the factory, so that if they fail, they do so before being sold. After the
infant mortality phase, devices enter a phase of constant failure rate, where (t) = , known
as the service life. Estimates for  are determined empirically by testing a large number of
components. They are usually expressed as a unit failure per a given number of hours, for
example  = failure/106 hours. After some period of time, devices start to wear-out and the
failure rate increases. This usually happens as a result of mechanical wearing with age and use.
Properly designed electronic devices will not have a wear-out region, instead continuing on at
a constant failure rate. This applies only to the electronic devices themselves, not necessarily
to complete systems that will likely contain mechanical devices.

(t) burn-in  service lifetime / constant failure rate  wear-out

                                                                                                                                     t

     Figure 8.5: Failure rate as a function of time, also known as the bathtub curve.
8.2. RELIABILITY PREDICTION                                       143

    In addition to failure rate, a PDF for the failure time of the device, fT (t) is defined, where
the random variable is time T . This function allows the question to be asked "What is the

probability that a device will fail between time t1 and t2? " It is important to note the difference
between (t) and fT (t). The failure rate tells us the average rate that a collection of identical
devices will fail at a given time t, while fT (t) is a PDF used to determine the probability that
a given device will fail within a specified time period. A CDF for fT (t) is determined as

                                               t                  (8.14)

                             F (t) = fT ( )d

                                             0

    F (t) answers the question "What is the probability that the device has failed by time t? "
and it is also known as the failure function. Take a few seconds to go back and review the
definition of R(t). It is clear that R(t) is directly related to F (t) and is its complement. The
relationship between the two is

                             R(t) = 1 - F (t)                     (8.15)

    Since F (t) is a CDF, it increases monotonically from an initial value of 0 to a maximum
value of 1 as time goes to  as shown in Figure 8.6. Conversely, R(t) starts at a value of 1 at
time zero and decreases monotonically to a value of 0.

1  R(t)                                           F(t)

Figure 8.6: Example reliability and failure functions.

    Since (t) represents data that is measured empirically, it is useful to establish a relationship
between (t) and the ultimate goal of reliability, R(t). To do so, a relationship between
(t), R(t), and is established as follows. Consider a small period of time between t and 4,
and determine the probability of device failure during this period. From the approximation
developed in Equation 8.7, this probability is given by

   P (failure betweentandt)  fT (t)t                              (8.16)

    How is this probability related to R(t) and (t)? R(t) provides the probability that the
device is working at time t and (t) gives the probability that the device will fail at time t.
The product of R(t), (t), and t gives the same probability of failure in Equation 8.16.

   P (failure betweent andt)  R(t)(t)t                            (8.17)

    Setting Equations 8.16 and 8.17 provides the desired relationship between the three quan-
tities

                             fT (t) = R(t)(t),                    (8.18)
144                                         CHAPTER 8. SYSTEM RELIABILITY

    that is fundamental in establishing the connection between R(t) and (t). However, the
PDF fT (t) needs to be eliminated from Equation 8.18. This is accomplished through its
relationship to the CDF F (t), and thus R(t), as follows

                                   d     d                          d
     fT (t) = dt F (t) = dt 1 - R(t) = - dt R(t)                                                 (8.19)

     Equating this result with Equation 8.18 produces

     - d R(t) = R(t)(t)  - ddt R(t) = (t)                                                        (8.20)
     dt                                                R(t)

     Integrating both sides gives

     t[ - ddt R( ) t t ]d = ( )d  -ln(R(t)) = ( )d                                               (8.21)
     0 R( )
                                      0                                0

     and solving for R(t) produces the final result for reliability as a function of (t)

                                                                                              t  (8.22)

                                              R(t) = exp[- ( )d ]

                                                                                            0

     During the service lifetime phase, the failure rate is constant, which simplifies to

                                                  R(t) = exp(-(t))                               (8.23)
     This important result is now applied in Example 8.5.

 Example 8.5 Transistor Reliability

Problem: Consider a transistor with a constant failure rate of  = 1/106 hours. What
is the probability that the transistor will be operable in 5 years?

Solution: This solution is found using the reliability function for a constant failure rate
in Equation 8.23 as follows.

                                      R(t) = exp(-t)

                                      1     24 hours 365 days
     R(5years) = exp(- 106 hours  day  year  5 years) =

                                                    = exp(-0.0438)
                                                         = 0.957
                                                         = 95.6%

Mean Time to Failure
The mean time to failure (MTTF) is a quantity which answers the question, "On average
how long does it take for a device to fail? " From its definition, it is apparent that the MTTF
is the mean value of the random variable T (failure time). It is determined from the PDF and
the definition of the mean in Equation 8.8 as follows
8.2. RELIABILITY PREDICTION                                                        145

                                                    

                                MTTF = tfT (t)dt                                   (8.24)

                                                     0

    At this point the form of the PDF for fT (t) is not known, but it can be found from
Equation 8.19 since it is the negative derivative of R(t). Assuming the form of R(t) found in

Equation 8.23 for a constant failure rate gives

                                fT (t) = - d R(t) = e-t                            (8.25)
                                             dt

This means that under the condition of a constant failure rate, the failure PDF follows an

exponential density. The MTTF is found from fT (t) via integration by parts to be

                                 MTTF = - te-t = 1                                 (8.26)
                                                        
                                                 0

This makes intuitive sense because  is the expected number of failures per unit time for

a device. Consequently, the reciprocal of  is the expected time between failures or MTTF.

Let's consider a few examples.

Example 8.6 Transistor MTTF

Problem: Consider the transistor in Example 8.5. (a) Determine the MTTF, and (b)
the reliability at the MTTF.

Solution: (a) From Equation 8.26 the

                               M T T F = 1 = 1/1061hours = 106 hours

                                                  = 114 years
.

    (b) From Equation 8.23 the reliability at 114 years is

                                                   R(t) = exp(-t)
                                                         106 hours

                           R(114years) = exp(- 106 hours ) = exp(-1) = 0.368
                                                         = 36.8%

    .

    This is a bit counterintuitive. Although the average time between transistor failures is 114
years, an individual transistor has only a 36.8% chance of surviving to 114 years. It would
seem logical that the reliability at 114 years should be 50% and that the transistor would have
a 50-50 chance of failing. This would be true if fT (t) were symmetric about its mean, but that
is not the case for the exponential density.

     Example 8.7 Human lifespan estimation.

    Problem: Data shows that for a 30 year old population, the failure (death) rate is con-
    stant with approximately 1.1 deaths per 1000 people per year. Given this data, estimate
    the MTTF of humans.

                              = 1 year = 103 years = 909 years

        From this MTTF is computed as

                                                            1
                                             M T T F = = 909 years!

                                                            

    While great news for those of us seeking longevity, this calculation is clearly wrong since
the upper limit on human lifespan is empirically known to be about 120 years. Why is this so?
Serious problems arise if R(t) is used in situations where the underlying assumption is invalid.
The results in Equations 8.23 and 8.26 apply only if the failure rate is constant. Although that
is nearly true for people in their 20s and 30s, it is not true as people age. People do wear out
and the failure rate increases with age.

Failure Rate Estimates

The overriding objective of this chapter is to estimate the future behavior of devices that are
used in electrical and computer systems. The particular behavior of interest is the state of a
device's functionality--the reliability, is it working or has it failed? Equation 8.23 indicates
that it is fairly straightforward to determine reliability, if the failure rate () is known and is
constant. One question to consider is what factors influence the failure rate of a device. Many
of us probably have had experiences in the laboratory where we have caused devices to fail
by subjecting them to conditions outside of the normal operating bounds, notably excessive
current, power, or heat. In those cases the devices probably failed, or burned up, due to
the operating conditions outside of the allowed bounds for the device. However, even when
operated within the allowable norms of a device's operating conditions, variations in factors
such as power, operating voltages, and temperatures impact .

    The United States Military has kept copious records of device failures in the field and the
conditions under which they operated. These records are synthesized in a handbook enti-
tled Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment [MIL-HDBK-217F] that provides failure
rates for various analog and digital components, along with adjustment factors to account for
operating conditions, the environment, and device quality. Categories of devices included in
the handbook are switches, fuses, diodes, optoelectronic devices, and microelectronic devices
(op amps, logic devices, microcontrollers, microprocessors). The handbook was last published
in 1991 and has been discontinued, but it is still widely accepted and used. Bellcore (sub-
sequently Telcordia) has developed newer models [Tel96] based upon MIL-HDBK-217F that
were updated to better predict the reliability of components. MIL-HDBK-217F is used here
since it is freely available in the public domain.

    Failure rates for resistors, capacitors, transistors, and integrated circuits from MIL-HDBK-
217F are included in Appendix C. For each device, a base failure rate is given, b, and multiplied
by a number of adjustment factors, denoted by the symbol , to estimate the device failure
rate . Each adjustment factor has a unique subscript and their values are found from tables
or equations in the handbook.

    For example, consider the low frequency field effect transistor in Appendix C. The overall
failure rate is given by the equation  = btauAQEfailures/106hours. b is the base failure
rate that is directly read from a table,  is a temperature factor which is computed from an
exponential equation (be careful to use the junction temperature as indicated in Appendix C),
8.2. RELIABILITY PREDICTION                                    147

A is an application factor that depends upon how the device will be used, Q is a quality
factor, and E is an environmental factor. The quality factor table lists some strange names
and values from 0.7 to 8.0. The quality factor describes the level of burn-in and screening each
device receives before leaving the factory. Joint Army/Navy (JAN, JANTX, and JANTXV)
quality factors are the highest standard, and are usually required only for space vehicles. That
individual attention to burn-in means that JAN parts are expensive and most JAN devices
have passed their infant mortality phase before leaving the factory. When determining failure
rate for a device from a table, it is common practice to always round parameters or values
pessimistically so that the evaluation is a worst case analysis of its performance. That way the
device should perform with a higher reliability when embedded into a system, hopefully causing
only pleasant surprises in operation. Finally, the factor E is based upon the different operating
environments that are identified in Appendix C. Example 8.8 demonstrates the application of
the MIL-HDBK-217F standard for reliability estimation.

    In summary, it is possible to estimate the reliability of devices if the failure rate is known
and it is constant. The US Military and Telecordia handbooks provide guidance for estimating
failure rates, and thus the component reliability. It must be kept in mind that they are
estimates and not guaranteed to predict the exact performance. It is also apparent that this
can become a rather time-consuming process if there are many components in a system, and
thus the use of reliability software packages may be warranted.

     Example 8.8 Reliability estimation using the MIL-HDBK 217F.

    Problem: Consider the circuit below that contains a bipolar junction transistor (BJT).
    This electronic circuit is a simple digital logic inverter. When the input voltage VI is
    0, the BJT is off, no current flows through any branches of the device, and the output
    voltage, VO, is 5V. When the input is 5V (high) the BJT goes into saturation due to the
    high base current (low RB), producing a 50mA collector current, a large voltage drop
    across RC, and an output voltage close to 0V. The average collector current for the two
    states is 25mA, producing an average power of 125mW (25mA*5V). Assume that the
    circuit is used in a missile launcher, the ambient temperature is 25°C, and that JANTX
    quality parts are used. Determine the MTTF and reliability for the 2N3904 BJT (a low
    power, low frequency BJT) in 20 years.

                                                       Vcc = 5V

                        IC  RC = 100

                                      VO = 5V or 0V

              RB = 10k                               = VI  VO

VI = 0 or 5V                2N3904

              IB

Solution: The objective of this problem is to determine the failure rate, from which the
MTTF and reliability are estimated. From the MIL-HDBK-217F data in Appendix C,
the failure rate is

will be examined in more detail shortly. The temperature factor is

    A is an application factor (switched or linear amplification), and the value for the
switched logic inverter is A = 0.70. R is a power rating factor that is computed based
upon the maximum rated power dissipation of the 2N3904 (625mW from the component
datasheet in Appendix D) as follows:

     R = (PR)0.37 = (0.625)0.37 = 0.84

    S is a stress factor that is computed from the ratio of the maximum collector-emitter
voltage over the maximum rated value of the device. In this circuit, the maximum value
of VCE is 5V (when the device is off and no current flows), while the maximum rated
value of VCE from the 2N3904 datasheet is 40V.

    VS = ratedVCE appliedVCE = 405 = 0.225
    Q is the quality factor, and based upon the fact that a JANTX part is Q = 1.0. E
is the environmental factor, and for the missile launch application, E = 32.0.
    All of this is brought together to compute the failure rate. The product of the ad-
justment factors is computed as

                                        failures

                                               = 99.97%
In conclusion, the BJT is estimated to be highly reliable in 20 years.

Thermal Management and Power Derating

One of the quantities computed in Example 8.8 was the junction temperature, TJ , which
was computed from the power dissipated in the device and a quantity known as thermal
resistance, . It is important to understand this in more detail, since it impacts the reliability
of microelectronic devices. Furthermore, if the junction temperature exceeds a certain value,
the device will fail. Thus, thermal management issues need to be taken into account. We
start with a physical model in Figure 8.8 (a), which has a junction (the integrated circuit or
device), enclosed by a case (the packaging of the device), surrounded by ambient environmental
conditions. In part (b) a heat sink is included which aids in thermal transfer. Each element
has associated with it a quantity known as thermal resistance that measures the ability of
that particular element to transfer heat to another element. A result from heat transfer for
electronics is that changes in temperature (T ) are proportional to the product of power
dissipation (PD) and the thermal resistance. This relationship is

                             T = PD                                     (8.27)

    It is similar to Ohm's Law where the change in temperature, power, and thermal resistance
(units = °C/W) are analogous to voltage, current, and electrical resistance respectively. The
total thermal resistance between two elements, such as between ambient and the junction, is
the sum of all thermal resistances between them. In the case with no heat sink, this produces
a junction to ambient resistance of JA = JC + CA, while in the case with a heat sink,
JA = JC +CA +SA. In the case of the heat sink, CA is replaced by the sum CS +SA,
which has a lower combined thermal resistance and greater ability to dissipate heat.

    This Ohm's Law type of relationship means that thermal transfer can be modeled using
familiar resistive circuits as shown in Figure 8.8. Based upon this circuit model, the tempera-
ture can be found at different points from the thermal resistance and power dissipation. Most
importantly the junction temperature is found as

                             TJ = TA + PDJA                             (8.28)

    Let's now apply these results. Manufacturer datasheets typically identify the absolute
maximum power dissipation and note that the device should be derated if operated at ambient
conditions above room temperature (TA = 25circC). The datasheets also supply a maximum
junction temperature for the device. It is clear from the resistive model that, for a fixed
power dissipation, the junction temperature increases along with ambient temperature. If the
maximum junction temperature is exceeded, the device will be destroyed. Another way to

look at this is that as ambient temperature increases, the maximum amount of power a device
can dissipate decreases. This decrease in maximum power dissipation is known as derating.
From Equation 8.28 the maximum power that can be dissipated in a device at a given ambient
temperature is

                                  PD,max = TJ,max - TA                                      (8.29)
                                                     J A

    From this relationship, a power derating curve is plotted in Figure 8.9 showing the maximum
power versus ambient temperature. Example 8.9 demonstrates the application of this to the
inverter in Example 8.8.

 Example 8.9 Power Derating for the Inverter Circuit.

Problem: Assume the circuit in Example 8.8 is operating at an ambient temperature
TA = 120C and that no heat sink is used. (a) Determine the derated power and if the
design is within the manufacturer's limits for power dissipation at this temperature and,
(b) re-compute the reliability at 20 years based upon this elevated operating temperature.

Solution: (a) From the manufacturer datasheet in Appendix D, the 2N3904 BJT has a
thermal resistance of JA = 200C/W and a maximum junction temperature of 150°C.
From this the maximum power is computed from Equation 8.9 as

                                  PD,max = 200C/W = 150mW

    The derated, or maximum, power at this temperature is 150mW. Clearly, the 125mW
of power dissipated as determined in Example 8.8 for the BJT is within this derated limit.

    (b) To compute the failure rate the junction temperature and  are re-computed.

T = exp - 2114 145 + 273 - 298 = 7.66

    With this new value, the value of  = 7.00x10-3/106hours, and the reliability is reduced
slightly to 99.88%. Note, however, the junction temperature is quite high at 145°C and further
increases in temperature would likely destroy the device.

Limits of Reliability Estimation

It must be kept in mind that the reliability estimates are just that, estimates, and there
are limitations in their use. First, realize that the failure rate data comes from accelerated
stress tests, where devices are put under stress beyond normal operating conditions, and from
these the failure rates are estimated. (Nobody sits around waiting 20 years for the devices
to fail!) The tests are based upon mathematical models for the failure rate and the device
lifetime. Secondly, there are other factors that influence reliability that are not addressed by
, such as the manufacturing processes used, the quality of manufacturing technologies, shock,
and corrosion. Part of the value of reliability estimation is for comparative purposes when
evaluating different design options. Applying these methods forces the designer to consider the
operating conditions and factor them into the design.
152                                              CHAPTER 8. SYSTEM RELIABILITY

8.3 System Reliability

The previous section focused on determining the reliability of a single device. It is natural
to ask, "How can the reliability of a system consisting of many devices be determined? " In
order to derive the overall reliability of a multi-component system, it is necessary to take into
account the overall system structure.

Series Systems

Consider the inverter circuit in Example 8.8--failure of any one component in the circuit would
lead to the failure of the overall system or circuit. Conceptually, a system in which the failure
of a single component (or subsystem) leads to failure of the overall system is known as a series
system. Figure 8.10 shows a block diagram of a series system composed of boxes S1, S2, . . . Sn
that represent the components, or the subsystems, of a larger system.

     S1  S2                                      ...       Sn

     Figure 8.10: A series system consisting of components, or subsystems S1, S2, . . . Sn.

    To compute the overall reliability of a series system, Rs(t), it is assumed that the failure
of subsystems or components are independent events. The system is operable only if subsys-
tems S1andS2 . . . Sn are all simultaneously operating. Therefore, the probability of the overall
system operating is given by the product of reliabilities for all of the subsystems as follows

                                                      n

     Rs(t) = R1(t)R2(t) . . . Rn(t) = Ri(t)                                                                             (8.30)

                                                      i=1

     It is important to remember that failures are assumed to be independent events, just as

flipping a coin twice is considered two independent events. The overall system reliability is

less than or equal to that of any single subsystem, since all reliability values are  1. Thus

Rs decreases as the number of subsystems increases. Assuming a constant failure rate for all
system components gives the following result for the overall system reliability

                                                                                                                     n  (8.31)

                                Rs(t) = e-1te-2t · · · e-nt = exp(- it)

                                                                                                                   i-1

     This leads to a series system failure rate and MTTF of

                 n1                                                                                                     (8.32)

considered for system reliability estimation.

Solution: (a) Conceptually this is a series system--if any of the individual components
fail, then the overall system will fail. That means that failure rates for the two resistors
are needed in addition to the value previously computed for the transistor. They depend
upon the power dissipated in each resistor, which is 125mW and 0.9mW for the collector
and base resistors respectively. The failure rate for a fixed composition resistor from
MIL-HDBK-217F is

resistor1 = bRQE failures/106 hours

For the collector resistor, RC, the base failure rate is computed as

b = 4.5  10-9exp 12 T + 273 exp S T + 273

                         343           0.6                      273

                         = 3.77  10-4

    The S term is the ratio of power dissipated to the maximum power rating. The values
R = 1.0, Q = 15.0, and E = 27.0 are directly read from tables. Thus the overall failure
rate for the collector resistor is

         RC = 3.77  10-4(1.0)(15.0)(27.0) = 1.53  10-1 failure/106 hours
The process for the base resistor, RB, is similar, and results in

                              RB = 6.1  10-2 failure/106 hours
The total failure rate is given from Equation 8.32 as

s = BJT + RC + RB = 0.215 failures/106 hours

                                                   0.215 24 hours 365 days
          Rs(t) = exp(-st) = exp - 106 hours  day  year  20 years

                                                      96.3%

    Since resistors are pretty reliable devices, the overall system reliability decreases only
a small amount relative to that of the BJT itself.

    (b) The MTTF is given by 1/s which in this case is 531 years.

Parallel Systems

From 8.30 it is clear that as more components are added to a series system, the reliability
decreases. It is natural to ask if the reliability can be increased. The use of redundancy gives
us a method to answer in the affirmative. A design has redundancy if it contains multiple
modules performing the same function where a single module would suffice. By its very nature
redundancy allows improperly functioning modules to be switched out of the system without
affecting its behavior. With redundancy the overall system functions correctly when any one
of the submodules is functioning. Figure 8.11 shows a simplified view of a parallel system
with subsystems S1, S2, . . . Sn.

     Figure 8.11: A parallel, or redundant, system consisting of subsystems S1, S2, . . . Sn

    In order to compute the reliability of a parallel system, note that a parallel system functions

correctly when S1 is functioning correctly, or S2 is functioning correctly, . . . orSn is functioning
correctly. It would be nice if it were possible to write an equation stating that Rs(t) =
R1(t) + R2(t) + . . . Rn(t) where + is the logical OR operator. Unfortunately, there is no direct
way to realize the OR operation in probability theory. This is resolved by working with failure

function, F (t), instead. The probability that the system will fail by time t, Fs(t), is equal to
the probability that subsystem S1 will fail and S2 will fail and . . . Sn will fail. This probability
is expressed mathematically as

         n    n

     Fs(T ) = F1(t)F2(t) . . . Fn(t) = Fi(t) = (1 - Ri(t))                        (8.33)

         i=1  i=1

     The overall system reliability of the parallel system is found from this as

                                                     n                            (8.34)

     Rs(t) = 1 - FS(t) = 1 - 1 - Ri(t)

                                                   i=1

    As more redundant components are added to a parallel system, additional 1 - Ri(t) terms
are introduced into the product term. This decreases the value of the product, hence the
overall system reliability is increased as more redundant systems are added.

    In order for a parallel system to work, a mechanism must be in place to monitor each of
the subsystems to make sure that they are operating correctly. Developing circuits to detect
failures and control the switching between subsystems can be complex and is not considered
here. Special care must be paid to the switching circuit itself, as malfunction of this circuit
could lead to an overall system failure. An example of parallel system reliability is given in
Example 8.11.

     Example 8.11 Reliability of a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID).

Problem: In a RAID, multiple hard drives are used to store the same data, thus achiev-
ing redundancy and increased reliability. One or more of the disks in the system can
fail and the data can still be recovered. However, if all disks fail, then the data is
lost. For this problem, assume that the individual disk drives have a failure rate of
8.3. SYSTEM RELIABILITY                               155

 = 10f ailuresx/106hours. How many disks must the system have to achieve a reliabil-
ity of 98% in 10 years?

Solution: The reliability of a parallel system with redundancy is given by Equation 8.34.
Since all of the disks are identical, the expression simplifies to

                                          Rs(t) = 1 - [1 - Ri(t)]n

                         10 24 hours 365 days      n
0.98  1 - 1 - exp - 10 hours  day  year  10 years

                         0.98  1 - [1 - 0.42]n

                         0.02  (0.58)n

                         log(0.02)  nlog(0.58)

                                                         n  7.2

    In order to achieve this reliability, n=8 disks are required. The reliability of each individual
disk is low at 42%, but using redundancy, the overall system reliability is quite high.

Combination Systems

Many real systems do not fit neatly into either parallel or series reliability models as shown in
Figure 8.12. Rather, they may be a combination of the two, and such systems will be referred
to as combination systems. One way to determine the reliability of a combination system
is to utilize the results obtained for series and parallel systems in Equation 8.30 and 8.34.
The system network is reduced by combining parallel subsystems into a single block, whose
reliability is given by Equation 8.34, while series subsystems are reduced to a single block
whose reliability is given by Equation 8.30. This is conceptually analogous to combining series
and parallel resistances in electrical circuits. The network is continually reduced until only a
single block remains whose reliability is known from all of the subsystem combinations.

    To illustrate this, consider the system in Figure 8.12. To determine the reliability, start by
combining the three parallel systems S2, S3, andS4 whose reliability is determined by applica-
tion of Equation 8.34 to be Rs2-4 (t) = 1 - (1 - R2(t))(1 - R3(t))(1 - R4(t))). The result is
then combined with S1 in series to give the overall system reliability,

    Rs(t) = R1(t) [1 - (1 - R2(t))(1 - R3(t))(1 - R4(t)))].
    The chapter concludes with Example 8.12 that addresses combination system reliability.

     Example 8.12 Combination system reliability.

    Problem: Consider the system shown below with the following reliabilities at a fixed time
    t, Rs1 = Rs2 = 80%. Determine the reliability that subsystems Rs3 , andRs4 must have
    so that the overall system reliability is greater than 95%. You should assume Rs3 = Rs4 .

    Solution: The parallel systems can combined into single systems whose reliabilities are

                                          Rs1,2 = 1 - (1 - Rs1 )(1 - Rs2 )

                                          Rs3,4 = 1 - (1 - Rs3 )(1 - Rs4 )
        They are combined in series to give the overall system reliability

                         Rs = [1 - (1 - Rs1 )(1 - Rs2 )]  [1 - (1 - Rs2 )(1 - Rs3 )]
        Substituting values and letting Rs3 = Rs4 gives

                                       0.95 = 1 - 0.22 1 - (1 - Rs3,4 )2
    .

        Solving for the reliabilities gives the final result

                                                   Rs3 = Rs4 = 0.90
    This example demonstrates the power of redundant systems. S1andS2 have somewhat low
reliabilities relative to the overall system goal, but the reliability of the parallel combination
of S1 and S2 is 96%. It requires a reliability for systems 3 and 4 of Rs3 = Rs4 = 90%, while
the combined reliability of systems 3 and 4 is 99%.

8.4 Summary and Further Reading

This chapter presented the basics of probability theory and methods for estimating the reli-
ability of components and systems. Failure rate is an important quantity that is determined
8.4. SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING  157

empirically and provides the rate of failure over the lifetime of a component or system. A
mathematical definition of reliability was derived from this quantity, which takes a simple
exponential form in the case of a constant failure rate. This was applied to estimate the reli-
ability of single components, particularly using failure rates from MIL-HDBK-217F. Issues of
thermal transfer and power derating were considered. Reliability estimation was extended to
more realistic systems consisting of multiple components in series and parallel forms. The use
of redundancy with parallel systems to increase the overall system reliability was addressed.

    There are plenty of good textbooks available on the probability theory, if it is necessary
to study probability theory further. The book Practical Reliability of Electronic Equipment
and Products [Hna03] provides detailed coverage for electrical systems reliability. It includes
factors not considered here such as thermal management on printed circuit boards, procure-
ment practices, and electromagnetic interference. Two excellent articles that demonstrate the
application of design for reliability and redundancy for an embedded system application are
by George Novacek in Circuit Cellar magazine [Nov00, Nov01].

     order to develop the RAID system, 20GB drives will be designed and utilized. To meet
     the requirement, you have decided to use a bank of 25 disks (25x20GB=500GB) and
     utilize a system redundancy of 4 (each of the 25 disks has a redundancy of 4). What

12. Consider the design of a triply-redundant majority voting system, with three binary
     inputs a, b, and c shown below. The inputs represent data from 3 independent sources
     from which the objective is to determine if the majority of the input bit values are logic
     level 0 or 1. Each majority circuit outputs the bit value that is in the majority of the
     inputs. The output of each majority circuit is fed into a resistor and LED (light emitting
     diode) network. The LEDs are lit if the output of the majority circuit is a logic 1,
     otherwise the LED is off. Ideally, all three LEDs are lit if the majority of inputs is 1, else
160                         CHAPTER 8. SYSTEM RELIABILITY

     they are all off. However, if part of the system fails, the LED readings may not be reliable,
     so a majority rules decision is used on the LEDs. The criterion used is that if two or
     more LEDs are on, then the majority of inputs are considered to be high, otherwise, the
     majority of inputs are considered to be low. Determine the probability of a false reading
     based upon this criterion if each component in the system (gate, resistor, or LED) has a
     reliability of 90%.

Teams and Teamwork

       The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest
       bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't
       be worth a dime.--Babe Ruth

    Engineering projects are often very large and require too many diverse skills to be com-
pleted by a single person. This necessitates the use of teams, and it is likely that you will
participate on many during your professional career. That is why employers of engineering
graduates consistently rate teamwork ability as one of the most desirable attributes in a po-
tential employee. Teams can collectively perform tasks that could not possibly be completed
by individuals working in isolation. However, just because a team is created does not mean
that it will function effectively, and examples of failed teams abound. When people learn that
they are going to work on a team, their initial reaction is often one of dread, usually due to
bad experiences in the past. The good news is that with some attention to team principles and
a conscious effort, working on a team can be a positive experience. Much research has been
done and much has been written on teams and teamwork. The objective of this chapter is to
provide a primer on what constitutes a team, present models of team development, identify
the characteristics of effective teams, and provide guidance for effective teamwork.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader should:

     Understand the characteristics that define a team and understand why a team is formed.
     Understand different models for the stages of team development.
     Understand the characteristics of effective teams.
     Be able to develop Team Process Guidelines.

164  CHAPTER 9. TEAMS AND TEAMWORK

9.1 What is a Team?

The concept of a team is used broadly in many different contexts, so the following definition
of a team proposed by Katzenbach and Smith in The Wisdom of Teams [Kat93] is provided
for the basis of our discussion:

       A small group of people with complementary skills, who are committed to a com-
       mon performance, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves
       mutually accountable.

    This concept of a team is highly relevant to engineering design projects.
    The definition indicates that a team should be a small group of people, typically two to
ten. Teams larger than this become very difficult to manage. The reason is that the number of
relationships between people increases rapidly with an increase in the number of people on the
team. The number of person-to-person relationships is equal to n(n - 1)/2 is number of people
on the team. Any one of these relationships can falter, causing problems. In addition, it is
hard to develop consensus on important issues as the number of people on the team increases.
    Second, the definition indicates that teams should be composed of members who have com-
plementary skills. Members should be selected based upon the background and skills that
each person brings to the team, not based upon personality and friendships. This leads to
the related concepts of cross-functional and multi-disciplinary teams. Cross-functional
teams are those that are composed of people from different organizational functions, such as
engineering, marketing, and manufacturing [Wil95]. Cross-functional teams are particularly
important in new product development, where multiple functions are required to bring a prod-
uct from concept, to manufacture, and ultimately to the market. Multi-disciplinary implies
that the team is composed of members from different disciplines. There is no agreement in the
engineering community as to what exactly constitutes a multi-disciplinary team. In general,
the idea of complementary skills applies where a team may have representation from multiple
technical disciplines. For example, the development of a robot would require members with
multi-disciplinary expertise in computing, electronics, and mechanical systems.
    Third, the definition states that teams should have common performance goals. The goals
take time to develop and the team will likely flounder in creating them, but without specific
goals to achieve there is no need for a team. In the context of design, the team's goals are
defined by the Problem Statement and Requirements Specification developed in Chapters 2
and 3 respectively. They collectively state what the team is trying to achieve and provide a
way for the team to verify its success--are the requirements met and can the team demonstrate
that they are?
    Finally, the team definition indicates that teams should have a common approach for which
they hold themselves mutually accountable. This can be a common approach to solving prob-
lems, such as application of the design process. It can also be in terms of a method for holding
the team members accountable. One of the biggest problems that teams face is handling sit-
uations where the team fails to meet a given objective. This may be due to one or more
members failing to meet their commitments. The team must be able hold each other mutually
accountable in a constructive manner in these situations.

9.2 Models of Team Development

Bruce Tuckman developed a model for team development that contains fives stages, known
as forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning [Tuc65]. It is instructive to have
9.2. MODELS OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT  165

an understanding of these stages so that you are aware of the dynamics that occur as a team
develops. The five stages are described as follows:

     Forming. This is the stage where the team is created. The team members may not know
       each other, leading them to be anxious and uncomfortable. It is likely that the team's
       objectives are not well-defined and that the members' roles are ambiguous.

     Storming. In this stage, the team works to develop its objectives, while the members
       try to define their roles. Conflict often appears as members jockey for position and
       advantage. It is characterized by fighting and power struggles, which may be overt, but
       in many cases are subtle and below the surface. The team must resolve individual versus
       group goals. For example, what if the team is trying to select a project concept? Some
       members may have strong opinions and preconceived notions about what the project
       should be. Failure to navigate the storming stage means that the team will not reach
       the performing stage and will be forced to return to the storming stage at some time.

     Norming. In this stage the team starts to become more cohesive. Members accept the
       team's objectives, their roles on the team, and they agree upon procedures. In this phase
       the team develops common approaches for solving problems and managing conflicts.

     Performing. In this stage, the team focuses on performing tasks and achieving the
       objectives set forth. The team should be collaborating and easily making decisions.
       Disagreements that arise are accepted and resolved by the team norms.

     Adjourning. Here, the team dissolves, hopefully due to successful project completion.
       However, it can occur abruptly if the project is cancelled, or even worse, if the team is
       unable to function together.

    Katzenbach and Smith proposed the team performance curve in Figure 9.1, which shows
the performance impact of teams versus varying levels of effectiveness. The types of teams they
defined are the working group, the pseudo-team, the potential team, and the high-performance
team. The most closely related stages of team development from the Tuckman model are
indicated in parentheses on the figure. Notice that the scale on the x-axis is team effectiveness,
not time. There may be an implicit assumption that teams will move through these stages as a
function of the time the team is together. That is certainly a desired goal, but not necessarily
what the model implies.

    The working group is defined as a group of individuals working in isolation, who come
together occasionally to share information. In other words, if every member of the team works
in isolation and meets only to share ideas, they would achieve the performance of the working
group. This level of performance is represented by the dashed baseline. In fact, the working
group is not a team as given by the definition and serves a very different purpose. The pseudo-
team represents an under-performing team where the sum effort of the team is below that of
the baseline performance, while the potential team is one in which the team is functioning at
a level equal to that of the working group. At a minimum, teams should at some point perform
above the level of a potential team, otherwise, there is no need for a team. The objective is
to perform at the level of a real team, where the performance exceeds that of the working
group. In rare instances the level of a high-performance team may be realized in which the
team significantly outperforms all similar teams.
166  CHAPTER 9. TEAMS AND TEAMWORK

Figure 9.1: The team performance curve proposed by Katzenbach and Smith [Kat93]. This
shows the performance impact of teams versus varying levels of effectiveness. The Tuckman
stages of team development (forming, storming, norming, performing) that are most closely
related to the performance points are superimposed on the model [Tuc65].

9.3 Characteristics of Real Teams

How can a team reach the performing stage and simultaneously become a real team? Unfortu-
nately, there is no set process for guaranteeing that a team will become a real team. There are
characteristics and principles of effective teams, and it has been observed that real teams ap-
ply these principles. However, realize that there is a difference between a team and teamwork
principles. Real teams apply teamwork principles but this does not imply that the converse
statement is true--that applying these principles will result in a real team. The lesson is that
successful teams adhere to good teamwork principles, but the application of good teamwork
principles does not automatically guarantee that teams will be successful. However, ignoring
teamwork principles almost always leads to failure. The remainder of this section presents
some of the characteristics of real teams.

Select Members Based Upon Skills

Selecting team members based upon their skills is a key to success identified by Katzenbach
and Smith. They defined three categories of relevant skills: 1) technical and functional, 2)
problem-solving, and 3) interpersonal. The right mix of technical skills on a design project
is important to achieve the desired objectives, reinforcing the need for multi-disciplinary and
cross-functional teams. Different problem-solving approaches and the mix of interpersonal
skills are important as well, but harder to determine. The Meyers-Briggs personality tests
9.3. CHARACTERISTICS OF REAL TEAMS  167

or the Keirsey Temperament sorter [Kei84] are tools that can be used to identify different
problem-solving approaches and personality traits, but in themselves are not the answer for
selecting teams.

    One important point to consider is whether teams should be formed by self-selection or
assigned by a supervisor. There are pro and con arguments for each method of selection. An
argument for self-selection is that members believe the objectives of the team are important,
leading to a higher level of commitment. A potential pitfall is that not enough attention is
paid to the skills necessary to complete the project. In the second case, teams are assigned by
someone who has an understanding of the skills needed for the project and assigns members
accordingly. A potential pitfall is that this may create animosity from team members who are
dissatisfied with the project from the outset.

Identify Objectives

Teams are created to realize shared goals, and if the goals are not well-defined, the motivation
for being part of the team is not clear. In the context of engineering design, the combined
Problem Statement and Requirements Specification presented in Chapters 2 and 3 serve that
purpose. The Problem Statement describes what the team is trying to achieve, while the
Requirements Specification sets verifiable targets that define success. Both items are so impor-
tant, that there should be a consensus agreement among the team members on their content.
The team should be challenged by targets that are aggressive, yet achievable. Identifying
measurable objectives was identified by Katzenbach and Smith as one of the most important
attributes of successful teams. Further, all team members must be committed to achieving the
objectives.

Develop Decision-Making Guidelines

Teams regularly make decisions that affect all of its members and the success of the project.
The team must determine how decisions are to be made, and once they are, all members
need to accept the outcome. The team also needs to understand the importance of different
decisions--not all are equally important and different approaches should be used depending
upon the impact of the decision. Models for decision-making are outlined as follows [Joh02]:

   1. Decision by Authority. The leader makes all decisions, typically without discussion by
       the rest of the team. This is effective for fast decision-making, but does often not lead
       to the best decision. It can also produce resentment among the team.

   2. Expert Member. The most expert member on the subject decides. This is effective in
       cases where there is a single member who is clearly the expert on the subject.

   3. Average Member Opinion. The average team member opinion is used. A method needs
       to be devised to determine what constitutes the average opinion.

   4. Decision by Authority after Discussion. The leader makes a decision after all team
       members discuss the issue and provide input.

   5. Minority Control. A few members act as a subcommittee and solve the problem. This
       makes sense if the minority group consists of experts on the particular problem.

   6. Majority Control. A simple majority is used to make decisions.
168  CHAPTER 9. TEAMS AND TEAMWORK

   7. Consensus. All team members must agree to and commit to the decision. This generally
       comes after much discussion and evaluation of the different alternatives. This is the best
       approach, and the most time-consuming. It is not necessary for all decisions to be made
       this way, but consensus should be reached for important decisions.

    A formal and widely used method for brainstorming and team decision-making is known
as the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) [Del71]. NGT was covered in Chapter 4 and is
repeated here. In NGT, each team member silently generates solutions to a problem and the
ideas are then reported out in a round-robin fashion until all ideas are exhausted. Then, each
member gets to cast a predetermined number of votes for the ideas presented. The top idea is
then selected, or alternatively, the top few ideas are discussed further and voted upon again.
The steps of NGT are outlined below:

   1. Read problem statement. It should be read out loud by a team member (the facilitator).

   2. Restate the problem. Each person restates the problem in their own words to ensure that
       all members understand it.

   3. Silently generate ideas. All members silently generate ideas during a set period of time,
       typically 5-15 minutes.

   4. Collect ideas in a round-robin fashion. Each person presents one idea in turn until all
       ideas are exhausted. The facilitator should clarify ideas and all should be written where
       the entire team can view them.

   5. Summarize and rephrase ideas. Once the ideas are collected, the facilitator leads a discus-
       sion to clarify and rephrase the ideas. This ensures that the entire group is familiar with
       them. Related ideas can be grouped or merged together.

   6. Vote. Each person casts a predetermined number of votes, typically three to six, for
       the ideas presented. The outcome is a set of prioritized ideas that the team can further
       discuss and pursue.

Hold Effective Meetings

Teams need to meet for a variety of reasons, such as determining objectives, tracking progress,
assigning tasks, preparing deliverables, and resolving problems. It is in these meetings that
teamwork principles are most critical and where problems can arise. In the workplace it is
estimated that people spend half of their time in tasks that are related to meetings (preparing,
attending, and following up). Three elements of effective meetings are: 1) well-defined roles
for the participants, 2) a structure for conducting the meeting, and 3) the application of
interpersonal skills [Bel94]. Poorly organized and ineffective meetings lead to cynicism and
poor team performance. The structure of meetings does not always need to be the same. Some
keys to effective meetings are:

     Have an agenda. Agree upon the goals for a meeting in advance.

     Show up prepared. All members should show up on time with their tasks completed.

     Pay attention. Each person should speak in turn, and there should be no disruptive
       side conversations. No person should monopolize the conversation and all points of view
       should be heard.
9.3. CHARACTERISTICS OF REAL TEAMS  169

     Agree upon a meeting time and place. People have busy schedules and different work
       habits. Believe it or not, failure to agree upon this basic issue can lead to tremendous
       conflict.

     Summarize. At the end of the meeting summarize what was discussed, important deci-
       sions made, and actions to be taken.

Develop Team Roles

As the group finds its norms, members should settle into different roles. They may be based
upon the technical aspects of the design, such as hardware, software, and mechanical systems.
The team may find that certain members are more effective at different tasks such as procuring
parts, making presentations, and writing technical documents. Roles often evolve and change
as the team develops.

    Team roles are usually not known early on in the forming stage and members can be assigned
formal roles to perform in at the outset. This is also common in group problem solving sessions
and a typical set of roles follows [App01]:

     Leader. The leader is not necessarily the authority figure, but should guide the team
       through the processes of decision-making and problem-solving. Effective leaders should
       ensure that all opinions are heard and that everyone is involved. Leaders coordinate
       tasks such as identifying the agenda.

     Recorder. The recorder is responsible for maintaining a record of the team's work, doc-
       umenting important results, and recording responsibilities for different tasks.

     Spokesperson. The spokesperson articulates the team's results. The recorder and spokesper-
       son roles are sometimes combined.

     Optimist. The optimist's role is to examine reasons why ideas and concepts will work,
       find their merit, and advocate other's ideas.

     Pessimist. The pessimist should challenge ideas and assumptions, and make sure that
       opposing ideas are presented and discussed.

     Analyst. The team analyst performs the important role of observing the team processes
       and provides feedback to the team for improvement.

    The roles presented here are by no means definitive and other models having different roles
can be utilized. The common thread is to have participants gain experience in the different
roles so that they can become more effective team members. No matter what role a member is
playing, they should all contribute to the solution of the problem at hand. As the team evolves
and becomes more experienced, the need for formal roles will diminish.

Assign Tasks and Responsibilities

Nothing creates problems more than when team members do not have clearly defined respon-
sibilities and tasks. The workload needs to be distributed in a fair manner and all members
must perform real work. Without this, one or two people do most of the work, or even worse,
nothing gets done. Chapter 10 presents project management principles, one of the primary
aims of which is to develop and assign tasks to team members. Teams may consider desig-
nating one person as the project manager who is responsible for tracking the team's progress
170  CHAPTER 9. TEAMS AND TEAMWORK

and ensuring that members are meeting their commitments. It is important that the project
manager also be assigned tasks, outside of project management, that contribute to the project.

Spend a Lot of Time Together

Teams that spend a lot of time together are generally more successful [Kat93]. This is not only
time together in meetings and working on project deliverables, but also includes extracurricular
activities. All members of the team should be included, not just a subgroup. Experience shows
that on teams of three students, two members may spend a great deal of time together and form
a bond. This can alienate the third person (not necessarily intentional) and lead to conflict.

Respect Each Other

Imagine a scenario where you are assigned to a team and one of the members is that quiet,
weird guy who never says anything, or that loudmouth who never shuts up. You may have a
real challenge ahead of you, but working with people who are not our best friends is a reality
of life. You have to learn how to deal with personality issues if you want to be effective on
teams. One key is to demonstrate respect for the other members of your team. Ways to do
this are to:

     Listen actively. Most people are not effective listeners. As they listen to others they are
       mentally formulating their response, while not actually listening to the other person. By
       listening to the other person, then formulating an appropriate response, you will develop
       a better understanding of their viewpoint and demonstrate that their opinion is being
       heard.

     Consider how you respond to others. How you respond to others impacts your effective-
       ness. Are you negatively evaluating others ideas or treating their ideas unfairly?

     Constructively criticize ideas, not people. It is fine to examine problems and construc-
       tively criticize ideas. Consider looking for ways to improve upon ideas that have flaws.

     Respect those not present. Nothing creates divisions and factions in a team faster than
       personally criticizing members not present. If a team member is not performing, refer to
       the Team Process Guidelines examined in Section 9.3 for holding them accountable.

     Communicate your ideas. If you have an idea, clearly state it and be prepared to explain
       what the merits are. Be prepared for critical analysis and discussion of the idea.

Manage Conflicts Constructively

Conflicts inevitably occur on teams, and the more constructively they are addressed the better.
Real teams do encounter conflicts, but they are adept at resolving them. Conflicts can be
good, particularly when they lead the team to the solution of a problem or the development
of consensus. They also provide an opportunity for members to express their opinions on
important issues. Left unresolved and unspoken, they lead to resentment, suspiciousness, and
escalate into personal conflicts. Conflicts may be false (you misinterpret another's behavior),
based on performance (member(s) aren't doing their work, or it is of poor quality), or based
upon procedure (disagree with the way that meetings are run or decisions are made) [Dom01].
Some strategies for resolving conflicts are:
9.4. PROJECT APPLICATION: TEAM PROCESS GUIDELINES  171

     Focus on performance and ideas. Focus on the performance of the team and not individual
       personality. Also, focus on ideas and constructively criticize them.

     Listen to others. It is very important to remain calm and listen carefully to others when
       conflicts arise.

     Identify concerns. If you have concerns about something, it is best to identify and address
       them, rather than hiding them.

     Apply the team's process guidelines. In the next section, a format for process guidelines
       that govern the behavior and processes of a team is given. This should address a team's
       approach for resolving conflicts. Importantly, the team must remember to apply the
       guidelines when conflicts arise.

     Develop a plan to resolve the conflict. Again, conflict can be positive and lead to the
       solution of problems. The team may not be able to resolve a conflict immediately, but
       can develop a plan for solving it within a specified period of time.

     Mediation. A mediator can be used after all avenues for resolution of the conflict have
       been exhausted. One way to do this is to employ a variation of the Delphi Technique.
       The Delphi Technique was originally developed as a brainstorming method to generate
       ideas anonymously from experts outside of a team or organization. It is applied for
       mediation through the following steps:

   1. Each member of the team should anonymously supply a description of the conflict and
       suggested remedies to the mediator.

   2. The mediator proposes a solution to the conflict, which is fed back to the team.

   3. The team members are given an opportunity to suggest modifications to the proposed
       resolution.

   4. Steps 1-3 are repeated until consensus is achieved.

9.4 Project Application: Team Process Guidelines

Teams should develop clear and detailed guidelines that govern their processes. These guide-
lines are based on the items covered in the previous section. The entire collection of guidelines
forms the Team Process Guidelines. Issues addressed in the Team Process Guidelines
include:

     The team's name. This creates an early opportunity for decision-making.

     The team's mission and objectives. This can be a brief re-statement of the design problem
       statement.

     Decision-making guidelines. Indicate what techniques are going to be used to make
       decisions and when they will be applied.

     Meeting guidelines. How will meetings be run and what are the expectations for team
       members in the meetings.

     Team roles. If teams self-select, they should justify their team choice with identification
       of the complementary skills each member brings to the team.
172  CHAPTER 9. TEAMS AND TEAMWORK

      Conflict resolution. Identify how the team will resolve conflicts. For example, what
        will the team do when members are doing sub-standard work and not meeting the per-
        formance objectives? How will the team determine what sub-standard performance is?
        What happens if a member misses a meeting? What will the team do if they cannot
        resolve the conflict among themselves?

    This document should be developed early on, referred to regularly throughout the project,
and updated by the team as necessary. Table 9.1 contains a checklist and self-assessment of
the team formation stage and processes.

9.5 Summary and Further Reading

This chapter touched on some of the fundamental concepts of team development that have
been reported in the literature. Two well-known models of team development were presented.
The first is the Tuckman model of the forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning
stages. It is important for teams to carefully navigate the formative stages, agree upon the
objectives, and reach the performing stage. The second is the Katzenbach and Smith team
performance curve presented in Figure 9.1. Selected characteristics of real teams were iden-
tified. Finally, Team Process Guidelines are a tool for identifying a team's norms, problem
solving approach, and self governing principles. A format for the guidelines was presented.

    There are many excellent books and resources available that examine teams and teamwork.
One that influenced this chapter greatly is The Wisdom of Teams by Katzenbach and Smith
[Kat93]. It is a seminal work in the field and a widely recognized resource that addresses how
to create effective teams. The forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning model
of team development was proposed by Bruce Tuckman [Tuc65] and is widely documented as
a good model for team development. The Team Training Workbook [Bel94] is another valu-
able resource developed by Arizona State University engineering faculty members. Teamwork
and Project Management by Karl Smith [Smi04] is a short introduction to both teamwork
principles and project management for engineering students. Free personality tests and tem-
perament sorters can be found online; one example being the Keirsey Temperament Sorter at

Project Management

       If you fail to plan, then you plan to fail.--Anonymous

    The engineering community has led in the development of project management practices
because building complex systems is a tremendous technical and managerial challenge. Cur-
rently, businesses tend to organize around projects that have significant value to the organi-
zation. Consequently, project management is consistently rated by employers as one of the
most desirable skills sought in new college engineering hires [Par03]. The project management
field includes topics such as initiating a project, team management, cost management, risk
management, controlling, resource management, and performance management, to name a
few. Many of these are addressed throughout this book from an engineering design viewpoint
such as controlling (design process), initiating (project selection), performance management
(requirements and testing), and team management.

    The three important objectives of project management are to complete projects that are
on-time, within budget, and meet the requirements of the user. Since user requirements were
addressed in Chapters 2 and 3, this chapter addresses the remaining two objectives of time
and cost management. Time management introduces the work breakdown structure, which
identifies the activities (combined tasks and deliverables) required to complete the project.
Responsibility for completing the activities is then assigned to members of the team. Two
graphical representations of the work breakdown structure, the network diagram and the Gantt
chart, are introduced. These visual depictions show dependencies between tasks and allow
for a quantitative analysis of the project plan. The chapter concludes with methods of cost
estimation.

     Be able to determine the critical path for completing a project and the float time for
       each activity in the plan.

     Be able to conduct break-even analysis and understand some basic methods of cost
       estimation.

10.1 The Work Breakdown Structure

The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of the tasks and de-
liverables that need to be completed in order to accomplish the project objectives. Creating
the WBS is typically the first step in project planning. A WBS is an ordered set of activities
required to complete the project. An activity is a combination of a task and its associated
deliverables. Tasks are actions that accomplish a job, while deliverables are entities that are
delivered to the project based upon completion of tasks. Examples of deliverables include a
circuit design, a software module, the integration and test of modules, a report, a presentation,
or obtaining an approval. Example tasks include conducting research or writing a program.

    The concept of the WBS was formalized by the United States Military in the 1993 doc-
ument Work Breakdown Structure Handbook [MIL-HDBK 881]. The WBS has gained wide
acceptance in industry and is described in MIL-HDBK 881 as follows:

     A product-oriented family tree composed of hardware, software, services, data, and facil-
       ities. The family tree results from systems engineering efforts.

     A WBS displays and defines the product, or products, to be developed and/or produced.
       It relates the elements of work to be accomplished to each other and to the end product.

     A WBS can be expressed down to any level of interest. However the top three levels are
       as far as any program or contract need go unless the items identified are high cost or
       high risk. Then, and only then, is it important to take the work breakdown structure to
       a lower level of definition.

    This description indicates that WBS results from systems engineering efforts and that
the structure of the WBS follows the design hierarchy. The second bulleted item focuses on
the activities for the project. Gray and Larson [Gra02] recommend identifying the following
activity attributes for each activity:

     A definition of the work to be done or delivered.

     A timeframe for completion of the activity.

     Resources needed to complete the activity.

     Person(s) responsible for the activity.

     Predecessors (or dependencies) for the activity. Predecessors are other activities that
       must be completed before the work can start.

     Checkpoints for monitoring progress.

    The collection of activities and their attributes are gathered in the WBS table. The rows of
the WBS table represent the project activities. These activities are arranged in a hierarchical
fashion; each major activity is followed by its constituent sub-activities. The columns of the

WBS table are the activity attributes proposed by Gray and Larson. Table 10.1 contains the
WBS table for the temperature monitoring design examined in Chapter 5 (Section 5.7).

    Each activity is assigned an identification number (ID) and a name. The hierarchical na-
ture of the activities is reflected in the ID numbering scheme. The three highest-level activities
in the project plan are the Interface Circuitry (1), LED and Driver Circuitry (2), and Sys-
tem Integration and Test (3). The first two activities are further refined into sub-activities
shown by the indented items. For example, the Interface Circuitry activity contains three
sub-activities: Circuit Design (1.1), Purchase Components (1.2), and Construction and Test
(1.3). The Construction and Test activity is further subdivided, producing a total of three
levels in the hierarchy. In this example, the WBS follows the hierarchical breakdown of the
design architecture itself.
178  CHAPTER 10. PROJECT MANAGEMENT

    Descriptions and deliverables for each activity are provided. The deliverables also serve as
checkpoints for monitoring the activity. The identification of checkpoints becomes more im-
portant as the complexity and duration of an activity increase. The deliverable items identified
for this example include circuit design schematics, simulation results, and test data. Deliver-
ables are even defined for activities that can be somewhat nebulous, such as Research A/D
Converters (2.1). Doing so ensures that activities do not become open-ended and have specific
deliverables for monitoring their progress.

    The fifth column in Table 10.1 is the estimated duration for each activity. The ability
to estimate durations is heavily influenced by past experience. The general tendency is to
underestimate the amount of time required. Keep in mind that credibility is lost if delivery
of the final system is repeatedly delayed, so durations should be estimated as accurately as
possible. Take into account time for unexpected problems, such as equipment failure, delayed
delivery of parts and equipment, and illness. System integration and testing are tasks that are
notoriously time-consuming. A method for estimating activity duration comes from the Project
Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) developed by the US Navy in the 1950s. Empirical
studies show that durations typically follow a Beta probability density. Based upon this model,
the duration of an activity is estimated as

     te = ta + 4tm + tb  (10.1)
                   6

    where ta is the most optimistic time estimate, tb is the most pessimistic time estimate, and
tm is the most realistic time estimate. The advantage of this is that it forces one to consider
best and worst-case scenarios in the plan.

    The person(s) responsible for each deliverable are identified in the WBS. Teams need to
consider how to assign responsibility to ensure mutual accountability is achieved. Assigning
one person to an activity provides a single person who is responsible for it. However, what if
that person needs additional support or backup? Who is going to help them if they are unable
to deliver? What if a team member becomes ill? It may make sense to assign multiple people
to activities based upon complexity. In Table 10.1, when a number is placed adjacent to a
person's name, it indicates that the person has primary (1) or secondary (2) responsibility for
that activity.

    The resources needed to complete the activity include material, equipment, and labor.
Material includes items that are consumed in creating the deliverable, such as electronic com-
ponents and printed circuit boards. Examples of equipment include test equipment, computers,
and software.

    Predecessors for an activity are the activities that must be completed before the given
activity can begin. Identifying predecessors is necessary for determining the sequencing of the
activities and the time to complete the project.

10.2 Network Diagrams

A network diagram is a directed graph representation of the activities and dependencies
between them for a project. Activity B is dependent on activity A when A must be completed
before B can be started. The network diagram allows a graphic visualization of the project that
also allows for quantitative analysis. In the Activity on Node (AON) form, the activities
are represented by nodes and the dependencies by arrows. Examples of the basic connections
allowed in the AON representation are shown in Figure 10.1.

    An example network diagram for a simple project is shown in Figure 10.2. Dummy activity
nodes for the start and end of the project have been included. The ID number and estimated

duration in days are indicated inside each node. A given network diagram will have multiple
paths from the start to the end of the project. A path is any connected sequence of activities
from the start node to the end node. In this example, there are four paths to completion:
P1 = {1, 4}, P2 = {1, 5}, P3 = {2, 3, 4}, P4 = {2, 3, 5}. The completion of an individual path
does not result in completion of the project--all paths (and consequently all activities) must
be completed for the entire project to finish.

Figure 10.2: Example network diagram. Each activity contains the activity ID and the esti-
mated duration in days.

    The duration of each path is determined by summing the duration of all activities on the
path, which in this case is 20, 26, 28, and 34 days for paths P1 to P4 respectively. The path
with the longest duration is known as the critical path since it represents the minimum
time required to complete the project. In this example the critical path is P4. Activities on
the critical path are of particular interest, since, if they fall behind schedule, or experience
slippage, the overall completion time of the project is delayed. The other paths can become
critical paths if their activities experience sufficient slippage to form a new critical path. A
quantity known as float quantifies this margin. Float is the amount of time an activity can
slip without extending the overall completion time of the project. Thus, all activities on the
critical path have zero float by definition. The following method is utilized to determine the
float for activities:

   1. Identify all paths on the network diagram and the duration for each path.

   2. The path with the longest duration is the critical path. Label the critical path duration
      as tcp All activities on the critical path have zero float.

   3. To determine the float for an activity that is not on the critical path, find all paths that
      the activity lies on and identify the one with the longest duration. Label this as tlp The
      float for the activity is calculated as
180                                       CHAPTER 10. PROJECT MANAGEMENT

                                                   F loat = tcp - tlp  (10.2)
     Examples 10.13 and 10.14 examine float time computation.

 Example 10.13 Float time calculation.

Problem: Calculate the float for activities in the network diagram shown in Figure 10.2.
    Solution: The first two steps of the process have already been completed, which are

the identification of the paths, their duration, and the critical path. To summarize, the
paths are P1 = {1, 4}, P2 = {1, 5}, P3 = {2, 3, 4}, and P4 = {2, 3, 5} with durations of
20, 26, 28, and 34 days. The critical path isP4 and tcp = 34 days, so activities 2, 3, and
5 have zero float. Thus

                                             F loat2,3,5 = 0 days

    The only two activities that are not on the critical path are 1 and 4. Let's examine
activity 1 first. It lies on paths P1 and P2 durations 20 and 26 days, thus the longest path
to completion tlp1, for activity 1 is 26 days. The float is calculated from equation 10.2 as
F loat1 = tcp - tlp1 = 34 - 26days = 8 days.

    Activity 4 lies on P1 and P3, so tlp4 = 28 days and the float is

                             F loat4 = tcp - tlp4 = 34 - 28 days = 6 days

    This means that activity 1 can slip by 8 days and activity 4 can slip by 6 days without
impacting the time to complete the project.

 Example 10.14 Network diagram construction and float time calculation for
the temperature display.

Problem: For the example WBS in Table 10.1, (a) create a network diagram, (b) deter-
mine the critical path and project completion time, and (c) determine the float for all
activities not on the critical path.

     Solution: (a) The network diagram is constructed from the dependencies identified

in Table 10.1 and is shown below.

    (b) The three paths from start to end are: P1 = {1.1, 1.2, 1.3.1, 1.3.3, 3},
P2 = {1.1, 1.2, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 3}, and P3 = {2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3} which have durations of 38,
10.3. GANTT CHARTS                                                              181

39, and 30 days respectively. Thus the critical path is P2 and its duration is
                                                 tcp = 39 days

        (c) All activities on path P1 are also part of the critical path, with the exception of
    activity 1.3.2, which has

                                        F loat1.3.2 = 39 - 38 days = 1 day
        Activities 2.1-2.4 have the collective float

                                      F loat2.1-2.4 = 39 - 30 days = 9 days

    The strength of the network diagram is that it provides an intuitive graphical representation
of activities and their dependencies on one another. This is particularly valuable for complex
projects where the paths to completion may not be obvious. It also allows identification of the
critical path and float times for activities. A disadvantage of the network diagram is that it
may be difficult to encapsulate the amount of information required for an in-depth project on
a single page in an easy to read format.

10.3 Gantt Charts

Gantt charts, developed by a mechanical engineer named Henry Gantt (1861-1919), are
a bar graph representation of activities on a timeline. An example Gantt chart is shown in
Figure 10.3 for the temperature display design. The Gantt chart effectively shows the WBS and
the timeline for completion. A traditional weakness of the Gantt chart has been the inability
to show the dependencies between activities. However, as seen in this example, this has been
remedied by modern project management software where the dependencies are indicated by
the connecting arrows between tasks.

10.4 Cost Estimation

The second main objective of this chapter is to address how to complete projects within budget.
In order to do this, the costs associated with the design, development, and manufacture of the
system need to be estimated. This section describes break-even cost analysis and economic
considerations followed by methods of cost estimation.

Break-Even Analysis

A break-even analysis aims to determine the number of units that must be sold for costs and
revenues to be equal--in other words, for there to be no profit or loss. The two types of
costs that factor into this analysis are fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are those that are
constant regardless of the number of units produced and cannot be directly charged to a process
or activity. Examples are rent, overhead, insurance, property taxes, design and development
costs, capital expenditures, market research, and sometimes labor costs depending upon the
situation. Capital expenditures are costs incurred for long-term assets such as equipment or
buildings. Variable costs vary depending upon the process or items being produced, and

fluctuate directly with the number of units produced. Examples are raw materials, inventory,
energy costs, and labor costs.

    The break-even point is the point where the number of units sold is such that there is
no profit or loss. It is determined from the total costs and revenue. The total cost required to
produce a product is the sum of fixed and variable costs. Assuming n units are sold, the total
cost is

                                                                         variable cost      (10.3)

     The total revenue generated by the sale of the n units is directly related to the sale price

                                                                  sales price               (10.4)
                                            Reveneue = n 

                                                                      unit
     The break-even point is where the revenue and total costs are equal

     n                      sales price cost  = fixed cost + n    variable cost             (10.5)

                                   unit                                unit

    The break-even analysis is shown graphically in Figure 10.4 with the costs and revenue
plotted as a function of units sold. Equation 10.5 allows different scenarios to be examined.
For example, based upon a certain cost structure and sales price, the volume of sales necessary
to break-even can be computed. Or, based upon a cost structure and projected number of
units sold, a target sales price can be selected. Example 10.15 demonstrates the application of
break-even analysis for the development of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet printer.

Figure 10.4: Graphical representation of the break-even analysis.

 Example 10.15 Break-even analysis for the HP DeskJet printer.

Problem: The following data has been publicly reported for the development and sale
of the HP DeskJet [Ulr03]: sales price = $300, development cost = $50 million, produc-
tion investment = $25 million, annual production (sales) volume = 4 million units per
year, and the sales lifetime is 2 years. Assuming a fictitious variable production cost of
$225/unit, determine: (a) the number of units that must be sold to break even, and (b)
the profit expected over an estimated sales lifetime of 2 years.

    Solution:
    (a) The objective is to determine the sales volume, n, necessary to break even. The
fixed costs are the sum of the development costs and production investment. So

                            Fixed costs = $(50 + 25)million = $75 million
This leads to a total cost for n units sold of

                                       Total cost = $75million + nx$225

The revenue is

                                       Revenue = n  300

Setting the revenue and total cost each equal at the break-even point produces

                                       n  $400 = $75 million + n  $225
184  CHAPTER 10. PROJECT MANAGEMENT

Solving for the final number of units gives
                                                 N = 1 million

    (b) Profit is the differential between the total revenue and the total cost and is ex-
pressed as

                                   Profit = total revenue - total costs
For an expected volume of 4 million units per year over 2 years

                             Profit = n  $300 - ($75 million + n  $225)

                        = 8 million  $300 - ($75 million + 8 million  $225)
                                            Profit = $525 million

Cost Models

The costs must be accurately estimated in order to realize the expected profit. The goal
here is not to address the complete subject of cost estimation, which is beyond the scope of
this book, but instead present some basic concepts and techniques for estimating development
costs. Many projects go over budget during development, and this is a particularly important
consideration from a design viewpoint. The WBS is a valuable tool for cost estimation be-
cause it divides the project into manageable pieces whose individual costs can be more readily
estimated.

    As identified in the WBS, the development costs associated with a project typically include
labor, equipment, and materials. Equipment costs can be determined in a fairly straightforward
manner, because many of the equipment needs are known a priori. Labor costs are tied directly
to the length of the project and are often the largest expense.

    Estimates of labor costs are usually based upon past experience and expert opinion. This
means asking others to estimate the cost and use it as a guide. The estimation formula in (1)
for activity duration can be applied for costs as

     Cost costa + 4costm + costb                                (10.6)
                         6

    where costa is the most optimistic cost estimate, costm is the most likely cost estimate,
and costb is the most pessimistic cost estimate.

    A more formal approach for estimating labor costs is to use empirical models that represent
a quantification of past experience. The models estimate an output based upon quantifiable
inputs related to the design or technology. Example inputs are the number of subsystems, the
estimated complexity of a circuit design, or an estimate of the lines of code necessary for a
software project. This changes the problem from opinion-based estimation to estimation of a
quantity that is presumably easier to find and a better indicator of the cost. The output of
the model is the cost or another quantity that is directly related to it, such as the estimated
number of person-hours.

    The simplest example is a linear model y = mx + b for estimating an output y (cost
or person-hours) based upon an input x. For example, IBM modeled software development
project costs using the number of lines of code as the input [Jal97] as
10.4. COST ESTIMATION                                185

                       Effort = a  KLOC + b          (10.7)

    The output is an estimate of the effort in person-months and the input is the projected
number of lines of code, KLOC. KLOC, pronounced "kayloc", equals thousands (kilo) of lines
of code. The linear model was found to work well for relatively small development projects
with between 4 and 10 KLOC. As the complexity increased, an exponential model was found
to be more realistic where

                       Effort = a(KLOC)b             (10.8)

    By observation of 60 software development projects at IBM, the exponential model was fit
to observed data and the parameters were estimated to be a = 5.2 and b = 0.91. The KLOC
model is applied in Example 10.16.

 Example 10.16 Effort estimation using KLOC.

Problem: Consider a software development project that has a team of 10 software de-
velopment engineers. The team has proposed a design and estimates that it will require
50,000 lines of code to complete the project. The average cost to the company for an
engineer is $100,000 per year, including salary, benefits, and overhead. Estimate (a) the
time required to the complete the project and (b) the labor costs.

    Solution:
    (a) Based upon the projected value KLOC, the exponential model in equation 10.8 is
most appropriate

                               Effort = 5.2(50)0.91 = 183 worker months

    Since there are 10 developers on the project, the estimated time is determined by
dividing the effort by 10, to produce an estimated time of 18.3 months.

    (b) The labor costs for development are determined from the number of person-months
and the average monthly salary of a development engineer as

Labor cost = 183 worker-months   $100, 000 1 year
                                                   
                                 year 12 months

                       Labor cost = $1.53 million

    The models in equations 10.7 and 10.8 are simplistic in that there is a single input to the
estimator. For example, what if there were 100 engineers assigned to the project in Exam-
ple 10.16? The model indicates that the project would be completed in 1.83 months at the
same cost. Common sense dictates that this is unrealistic; this problem is commonly referred
to as the "mythical man-month" (person-month). The mythical person-month refers to the
fact that just adding more people to the team will not linearly reduce development time. The
reality is that many factors impact the costs, which leads to effort estimation based on many
inputs. An example of this is the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) that is also used in
software development. There are different levels of COCOMO that allow increasingly complex
model inputs, such as the type of technology employed, the maturity of the technology, the
size of the team, the experience of the engineers, and the timeframe required to complete the
project. Not only do the models estimate costs, but they can also be used to estimate how many
186  CHAPTER 10. PROJECT MANAGEMENT

engineers are needed to complete projects of a given complexity. Although the examples cited
here are from the software field, the concepts are general and applicable to the development of
many technologies.

    Empirical cost models can also be developed for the materials necessary for the manufacture
of items. Material estimates are often based upon the expected size and types of technologies
used in the manufactured part. For example, a cost model for the manufacture of a printed
circuit board may have as inputs the size of the board, the number of layers, and the type of
technology used (such as through-hole vs. surface mount).

10.5 The Project Manager

Many engineering teams have a project manager responsible for planning and organizing the
project. The project manager may take primary responsibility for developing the WBS, the
network diagram and Gantt chart, the cost estimates, and the budget. Although the project
manager may have primary responsibility for the project plan, all team members should have
input and contribute to development of the plan. The project manager should monitor the
checkpoints and deliverables against the plan and develop strategies for reacting to slippage
in any activities. The plan should be updated as necessary and the changes communicated
to all involved. The project manager may also have primary responsibility for the purchasing
of materials and controlling spending. Project managers are not necessarily the boss in the
traditional sense and should be viewed as member of the team. As such, it is important for
the project manager to also be responsible for completing project deliverables in addition to
the project management tasks.

10.6 Guidance

The following is guidance to consider when creating the project management plan, and is
particularly relevant for those working on capstone design projects:

     Build the plan after the design architecture is complete. The project plan can be created
       at any point in the design process. Our experience shows that a good time to develop
       it is after the system design architecture is complete. The design serves as a good guide
       for developing the WBS.

     Take the initial time estimates for activities and double them! Most people tend to
       significantly underestimate the amount of time it takes to complete an activity. That is
       because people often have a conceptual idea of what it will take to complete the task and
       can envision the steps to completion. The desire to please superiors also influences people
       to underestimate the time to completion. Although it may not be necessary to double
       the time estimates, you can incorporate the most optimistic and pessimistic estimates
       and apply Equation 10.1 Or, if a proven mathematical model exists, such as the KLOC
       estimator in Equations 10.7 and 10.8, it can be used to estimate times.

     Assign a lot of time for testing and integration. During integration many people must
       work together to integrate components that may have been developed in isolation. Prob-
       lems with a single component can bring the integration to a halt. Delays may be com-
       pounded by necessary re-design to correct the problem.
10.7. PROJECT APPLICATION: THE PROJECT PLAN  187

     Factor in lead times for part ordering. Even with the Internet and overnight delivery, you
       may find that needed parts and equipment are out-of-stock. Lead times for seemingly
       commonplace items can sometimes be quite lengthy.

     Assign a project manager(s). Consider assigning one individual who has primary respon-
       sibility for organizing and monitoring the plan. Again, the project manager must also be
       responsible for some of the deliverables for completion of the project.

     Do not assign all team members to all tasks. Experience shows that when this is the case
       nobody is responsible for anything and the work doesn't get done. There needs to be
       individual accountability for all team members. However, it may be a good idea to have
       more than one person responsible for activities for backup support as shown in the WBS
       in Table 10.1.

     Track the progress versus the plan. There is a tendency to create the plan and then ignore
       it. The plan is only valuable if it is monitored and progress is tracked.

     Don't become a slave to the plan. Circumstances usually dictate change. Be prepared
       to shift resources as needed. Monitor the plan to see if there are changes to the critical
       path or if a new critical path emerges.

     Experience counts. Get started now in developing this experience by creating a plan for
       your project.

10.7 Project Application: The Project Plan

A project plan should contain the following:

     Work Breakdown Structure. Identify the activities, deliverables, responsibilities, dura-
       tion, resources, and dependencies as demonstrated in
       Table 10.1. Be sure to provide sufficient detail in the structure and identify clear deliv-
       erables.

     Gantt Chart and/or Network Diagram. Provide a graphical representation of the project
       plan. Network diagrams have the advantage of showing the dependencies, while Gantt
       charts show the timeframe. Modern software tools allow both to be integrated into the
       same graph and are a good compromise as demonstrated in Figure 10.3. The critical
       path should be identified and the float for non-critical path activities understood.

     Costs. Develop a tabulated list of costs and for the equipment, materials, and labor
       necessary to carry out the project. It may not be necessary to develop labor costs for
       a capstone project, yet it is good practice to estimate person-hours and compare the
       estimate to the actual at the end of the project.

10.8 Summary and Further Reading

Three main objectives of project management are to complete projects that are on-time, within
budget, and meet the needs of the user. This chapter addressed the time and budget aspects.
The key element in developing a project plan is the WBS, which is a hierarchical identification
of the activities needed to complete the project. Both network diagrams and Gantt charts can
be created from the WBS. A network diagram is a graphical representation of activities and
188  CHAPTER 10. PROJECT MANAGEMENT

their dependencies that provides for quantitative analysis of the project plan. This analysis
includes computation of the critical path and float times. The Gantt chart is related to the
network diagram, but provides a time scale representation of the activities. In terms of the
budget issues, a simple profit and loss model was presented with a break-even analysis. Model-
based techniques can be used for estimating labor costs, where the models are built from the
analysis of similar projects. The models can be linear or nonlinear with single inputs. More
complex models can be developed with multiple inputs in order to arrive at a more precise
estimate.

    Project management is a well developed field and there are many good textbooks and
online resources available for delving deeper into the subject. Project Management by Gray
and Larson [Gra02] is a comprehensive text on the subject that includes risk management,
resource scheduling, leadership, and performance measurement.
Planning, Performing, and Controlling Projects by Angus et al. [Ang00] is written for an
engineering and scientific audience, and integrates phases of the design process. MindTools
(www.mindtools.com) is an online resource that addresses many career skills including project
management.

Ethical and Legal Issues

       A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world.--Albert Camus
    In your professional career you are going to face ethical dilemmas, and how you respond
to them will affect your reputation, your employability, and the welfare of others. Systems
are developed for use by other people, and the decisions that go into their design impacts the
health and safety of those people. There are plenty of high profile examples, such as the two
space shuttle disasters, that make it clear that the decisions of engineers and scientists have
serious implications. Beyond issues in the technical aspects of design, there are professional
ethics that govern the broad scope of interactions between people in the workplace. The aim of
this chapter is to present the basics of engineering ethics and provide guidance for addressing
dilemmas when they arise. It presents a basic overview of morality and ethics, professional
codes that apply to the engineering profession, intellectual property and legal issues as they
relate to design, how to apply ethics throughout the design process, and guidance for handling
ethical dilemmas. The chapter concludes with case studies that provide an opportunity to
apply ethical decision-making skills.

      Be able to analyze ethical case studies and suggest solutions to the dilemmas that they
        embody.

11.1 Ethical Theory in a Nutshell

Here is an ethical dilemma to consider as we start our discussion. Let's assume that you are
conducting a job search during your senior year in college and have interviewed with several
prospective employers. Company A offers a you job and you accept the position and you sign a
contract agreeing upon a starting salary, position, and start date. Two weeks later, Company
B also offers you a job with a higher starting salary and work that you find personally more
interesting. You have a choice to make. Do you turn down the offer of Company B and stay
with A? Or do you accept the offer made by B and then inform A that you are not going to
work for them? This is a classic dilemma that many students will face, and rather than trying
to answer it now, let's revisit it later.

    There is often confusion as to what exactly is meant by the related concepts of ethics and
morals. Morality is concerned with principles of right and wrong and the decisions that derive
from these principles. Morals are often taught by stories that are common in all cultures, such
as Aesop's fable of the boy who cried wolf. In this story, the boy was watching sheep and cried
wolf when there was no wolf present. In response, all of the villagers came running to help
him, only to find no wolf. When the wolf did later appear and the boy cried for help once
again, nobody believed him nor came to help, and the wolf scattered the flock. The moral of
this story is that it is wrong to lie, and when a person becomes known as a liar, nobody will
believe him/her even if he/she is telling the truth.

    The term ethics is closely related to morals and they are often used interchangeably. Ac-
cording to the American Heritage Dictionary, ethics is defined as:

       1. Branch of philosophy that deals with the general nature of good and bad and
       the specific moral obligations of and choices to be made by the individual in her/his
       relationship to others. 2. Rules or standards governing conduct, especially those
       of a profession.

    Ethics is the philosophy or study of moral obligations and the choices to be made by
individuals. It is important to understand that if there is no decision to be made, there is no
ethical dilemma. The choices to be made are based upon a belief as to what is good or bad,
and the decisions must impact relationships to others.

    Morals derive from principles, which are fundamental laws or rules that govern behavior.
An example of a principle is the Golden Rule, which states that people should treat others
as they themselves would like to be treated. The Golden Rule is a universal principle and
embodied in one form or another in all major religions and belief systems of the world. Another
example of a principle is the belief that people should be honest and trustworthy in their
dealings with others. Value is another term that is often heard in ethical discussions. A value
is something that a person or group believes to be valuable or worthwhile. This could be
relatively innocuous such as valuing baseball as a sport, or something more significant such
as valuing hard work. A group of thieves may believe that it is valuable to steal from other
people, but not from their own group. As these examples show, shared values may be good
or bad. The final example clearly violates the principles of the Golden Rule and is considered
bad by most people.

    Rule-based ethics are based upon a set of rules that can be applied to make decisions.
In the strictest form they are considered to be absolute in terms of governing behavior--either
11.2. THE IEEE CODE OF ETHICS  193

you follow the rule (good) or break the rule (bad). This type of an ethical system is based
upon the principles of universality and transitivity. Universality means that the governing
rules are such that they can be accepted by everyone, while transitivity means that you would
accept others applying the same decision to you. A problem with rule-based ethics is defining
a universal set of rules that everyone can agree upon. There may be a few rules or principles
that can be agreed upon by all, but going beyond that is difficult.

    Conditional rule-based ethics means that there are certain conditions under which an
individual can break a rule. This is generally because it is believed that the moral good of the
situation outweighs the rule. For example, if you have a seriously injured person in your car
and are transporting them to the hospital, is it acceptable to exceed the speed limit? In this
case, it may be deemed that the moral good of getting the person prompt medical attention
outweighs the obligation to obey the speed limit. It is generally believed that killing others is
wrong, except in the case of war. Is it acceptable to cheat on an exam because you stayed up
all night to help your sick roommate? Or is it acceptable to cheat because you simply did not
have enough time to study because of your other obligations? In each of these cases a moral
choice has to be weighed.

    In utilitarian ethics, decisions are made based upon the decision that brings about the
highest good for all, relative to all other decisions. This sounds appealing, but has drawbacks
in that bad choices may need to be made for certain parties in order to achieve this overall
good. It becomes very difficult to determine exactly what the highest good is. Situational
ethics are where decisions are made based on whether they produce the highest good for the
person. In this case, decisions are made based upon the impact to the individual and situation
at hand. This is generally considered a poor ethical decision-making approach.

    Let's conclude this section with a new scenario. Let's assume that you are conducting a job
search and Company A offers you a job, you agree upon terms of the offer, accept it, and sign
a contract. You then inform the other companies that interviewed you that you are no longer
available. One month later Company A calls you and notifies you that they are rescinding
their offer. Although they can no longer offer you the job, they will provide you with $1,000
in compensation for rescinding the offer. You later find out that Company A just offered the
exact same job to another student in your class who has a higher grade point average than
yours and more experience with the technical products they design. Was the decision of the
company ethical? Returning to the original case, is it ethical for the student to rescind their
acceptance of the original job offer and then accept the other?

11.2 The IEEE Code of Ethics

Most engineering disciplines have associated with them a professional society or organization.
In electrical and computer engineering two important ones are the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The
objective of professional societies is to promote and support their respective fields. They offer
a variety of services and benefits to their members, such as access to technical information,
networking opportunities, and financial services. They also define accepted practices of their
members that are embodied in an ethical code. In fact, professional societies were originally
created to provide guidance for ethical practices in their field and to ensure the safety of the
public. The IEEE Code of Ethics, shown in Table 11.1, applies broadly to the electrical,
computing, and software fields.

    Some of the values embodied in the code are that of treating others with fairness and
respect (8-10), honesty and trustworthiness (2-4), and professional competence (6-7). The
importance of the safety of the public is clearly identified in the first and ninth items of the
194  CHAPTER 11. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES

                                  Table 11.1: The IEEE Code of Ethics.

We, the members of the IEEE, in recognition of the importance of our technologies in affecting
the quality of life throughout the world, and in accepting a personal obligation to our profession,
its members and the communities we serve, do hereby commit ourselves to the highest ethical and
professional conduct and agree:
1. to accept responsibility in making engineering decisions consistent with the safety, health and
welfare of the public, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the
environment;
2. to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest whenever possible, and to disclose them to affected
parties when they do exist;
3. to be honest and realistic in stating claims or estimates based on available data;
4. to reject bribery in all its forms;
5. to improve the understanding of technology, its appropriate application, and potential conse-
quences;
6. to maintain and improve our technical competence and to undertake technological tasks for
others only if qualified by training or experience, or after full disclosure of pertinent limitations;
7. to seek, accept, and offer honest criticism of technical work, to acknowledge and correct errors,
and to credit properly the contributions of others;
8. to treat fairly all persons regardless of such factors as race, religion, gender, disability, age, or
national origin;
9. to avoid injuring others, their property, reputation, or employment by false or malicious action;
10. to assist colleagues and co-workers in their professional development and to support them in
following this code of ethics.
Approved by the IEEE Board of Directors, August 1990

code. The code provides a common basis for analyzing ethical cases studies and is applied for
these purposes in subsequent sections.

11.3 Intellectual Property and Legal Issues

It is important to understand some legal issues, particularly as they impact product design and
development. The first considered is intellectual property, which seeks to answer the question
of who owns an idea or invention. The second is that of legal liability, which comes into play
if somebody is injured or harmed by a product or system.

Intellectual Property

The intent of designing a new product is usually to sell it for a profit, which leads to the
issue of ownership of both the intellectual property and the profits. The tools for protecting
intellectual property are patents, trade secrets, and copyrights. Be aware that when you enter
the workforce as an engineer, your employer may ask you to sign an agreement assigning their
company rights to all of the intellectual property that you create while in their employ. Such
contracts are common and enforceable.

    The most well-known way of protecting a design or invention is with a patent. If a patent
is held for a technology, others cannot use it without permission of the owner. The owner
can deny others the right to use it, or grant the right to use it in exchange for monetary
compensation. The two types of patents are utility and design patents. The United States
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) defines the difference between the two as follows:
11.3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LEGAL ISSUES  195

       A utility patent may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new and
       useful process, machine, article of manufacture, compositions of matter, or any new
       useful improvement thereof. A design patent may be granted to anyone who invents
       a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.

    The one that is of most interest for this discussion is the utility patent, as the design patent
focuses on aesthetic design issues.

    In order to be granted a utility patent, the invention must meet three conditions: it must be
novel, non-obvious, and useful. Novelty means that the idea must be new and that nothing like
it already exists. It cannot be an idea that is already patented or has been published for more
than a year. The non-obvious condition means that another person would not be expected to
develop the same idea based upon existing technology. As an example, for personal computers,
it would not be possible to patent the idea of increasing data storage by adding multiple disk
drives, since this is an obvious extension of existing technology. Useful means that the device
must perform a useful function and be able to be reduced to practice. You could not patent
the concept for a transporter of the type seen on science fiction shows, such as Star Trek, where
people are beamed instantaneously through space from one place to another--unless of course
you can reduce it to practice.

    To a file a patent, extensive research needs to be done to be sure that the idea is novel.
A good place to start is the US Patent Trademark Office (USPTO) website (www.uspto.gov)
and its searchable database of patents back to 1790. The database allows full text search of
patents from 1976 forward and patent number search back to 1790. It provides full images of
all patents in the database. The website also has information on how to apply for a patent
and describes the differences between patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The elements that
are contained in a patent are:

     A citation of prior art. This is similar patents and publicly reported technology.

     A description of the invention. This describes how it operates and how it would be
       reduced to practice.

     Claims. They are the legal description of the invention and its unique aspects.

    The claims are used to determine if another party is infringing upon a patent, and thus
they must be carefully thought out and properly worded. If the claims are too broad or too
specific then they may not provide much protection. There are fees for filing the patent and
for periodic maintenance that can cost between $5,000 and $10,000 over the life of the patent.
Hiring a good patent attorney is invaluable in the application process and will cost money--
it is not unusual to spend $20,000 for lawyer and application fees. When selecting a patent
attorney, make sure that he/she has a good track record and reputation.

    An example patent for a hardware design of a fast floating point overflow and sign detection
unit (US Patent #6,779,013) is shown in Figure 11.1. The patent is owned by Intel Corporation
and the inventor was one of their employees. The first page identifies prior art that relates to
this patent. This includes previous patents related to this technology, which in this case goes
back to 1991. It is not unusual to cite prior patents that go back 50 or 100 years. In addition
to patents, prior art in publicly available literature is identified. The first page also identifies
the number of claims and supporting figures, and shows the high-level design architecture. A
description of the system starts on the second page as shown in Figure 11.1 (b). The complete
description is fairly lengthy and only the first page is shown. It is similar to a technical report
in that it provides background on the technology and describes the invention and its operation
196  CHAPTER 11. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES

in detail. The final page of the patent (Figure 11.1 (c)) identifies the legal claims that make
the invention unique.

    In the United States, patents are granted based upon the concept of first to conceive the
invention, not first to file the patent application. If two parties are applying for a patent at the
same time, then the one who demonstrates that they were the first to conceive the idea and
reduce it to practice receives the patent. Good records must be maintained to prove this. It
is done by recording inventions in a bound design notebook with numbered pages that cannot
be removed. All entries should be clearly described, understandable by other engineers, and
be signed and dated. For the best protection, entries should be signed and witnessed by at
least one other person and the notebook should be occasionally notarized. Pages should not
be removed from the notebook and entries should be made in non-erasable pen. Mistakes and
blank spaces should be crossed out, signed, and dated. Figures should be drawn directly in
the notebook, while computer generated figures are pasted in so that they are not removable.
It is good practice to maintain a design notebook even if you are not planning to patent your
ideas.

    Once a patent is granted, it is good for 20 years--after it expires, the invention is fair
game for anybody to use. Let's assume that you are the owner of a patent and you find that
somebody is infringing upon it. Is the government going to come in and start legal action
against the infringer? No--a patent only gives the owner a right to sue others if they infringe
upon it. The government does not actively seek out offenders and protect your intellectual
property. The owner of the patent must protect it.

    There are drawbacks to patents. The owner must be vigilant in defending a patent and
may have to initiate legal action to do so. Once an idea is patented, it is made public for
all to see on the government's website. This may not be a good idea depending upon the
technology and competitive situation. An alternative that many companies employ to protect
intellectual property is to hold them as trade secrets. Obviously, the idea must be kept
secret so that others cannot find out about it. This is often done by restricting the number
of people who have access to the idea and by having those who do know about it sign a
non-disclosure agreement. It is common practice for companies to ask employees and
visitors to their facilities to sign a non-disclosure agreement that prevents the signer from
disseminating information about their products, services, and trade secrets. If one breaks a
non-disclosure agreement, they can be held legally liable. Trade secrets pose another type of
risk to a company, since once the secret is revealed, it is fair game for competitors. One way
to determine a competitor's trade secrets is through the use of reverse-engineering, where a
device or process is taken apart to understand how it works. Reverse-engineering is legal if the
information is obtained through legal means, but one must be careful with the information that
is obtained and not copy it unless legally allowed to do so. The Digital Millennium Copyright
Act of 2000 prohibits breaking technological protections, such as encryption, to learn about a
competitor's product.

    Copyrights protect published works such as books, articles, music, and software. A copy-
right means that others cannot distribute copyrighted material without permission of the
owner. It is easy to obtain a copyright--all that a person has to do to copyright material
is indicate the word "copyright" on the work, along with the year of publication, and iden-
tify the name of the copyright holder. Copyrights can be officially registered through the US
Copyright Office, and it is a good idea to do so for involved works such as writing a book or
publishing music. Registering provides a stronger legal basis for pursuing claims. Copyrights
are good for the lifetime of the holder plus 50 years, while for a company they are good for 75
years.

200  CHAPTER 11. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES

Liability and Negligence

Civil lawsuits, which are those that are relevant for our discussion, are those in which one party
sues another. They involve something that is known as a tort, which serves as grounds for the
lawsuit. A tort is a wrongful act, though not necessary illegal, for which a civil lawsuit can be
brought, including product liability. A company or person can be sued for damages caused by
a product design and be held liable for them, meaning required to pay monetary damages.

    The two standards for determining legal liability in tort law are that of negligence and strict
liability. In the case of negligence, it must be shown that the manufacturer did not follow
reasonable standards and rules that apply to the situation and also committed a wrongful act.
Exactly what constitutes reasonable has to be determined for the particular case. For a product
design, a manufacturer can be held legally liable for negligence if the plaintiff demonstrates
that the following four conditions hold true:

   1. The manufacturer had a duty to follow reasonable standards and rules.

   2. There was a breach of duty (i.e., failed to include safety devices).

   3. The plaintiff was harmed.

   4. The breach caused the harm.

    Depending on the severity of the danger, there are different levels of negligence: simple,
gross, and criminal. Negligence claims can be brought for design flaws, manufacturing defects,
and for failing to warn the user of safety hazards.

    An even less stringent standard than negligence is known as strict liability, in which the
following four conditions must hold true:

   1. The product was dangerous and/or defective.

   2. The defect existed when it left the manufacturer's control.

   3. The defect caused harm.

   4. The harm is assignable to the defect.

    Strict liability focuses only on the product itself--if the product contains a defect that
caused harm, the manufacturer is liable. This is regardless of whether there was negligence, if
safety devices were incorporated, or if the user was warned of potential dangers. If the product
had a defect or was dangerous when it left the hands of the manufacturer, the manufacturer
may be liable.

11.4 Handling Ethical Dilemmas

You are going to encounter ethical dilemmas in your career, both technical and based upon
interpersonal relations. Ethical dilemmas are not always obvious and can be quite subtle. A
supervisor probably won't say "Could you falsify this data for me so we can ship the product?"
The pressure will likely be much more subtle and over the course of multiple conversations.
Consider the following sequence of statements: "We have invested a lot of time and money
in the design."; "We really need this system to work."; "The company's future depends upon
this."; "Is there any way that we can make adjustments to make it pass the certification."; "Is
11.4. HANDLING ETHICAL DILEMMAS                                 201

it close enough that we could certify it? It really meets the needs and the standard has a margin
of error built in to it."

    A framework for considering decisions is shown in the 2x2 matrix shown in Figure 11.2
[Die00]. The idea is that decisions have both ethical and legal dimensions to them. The legality
may be in terms of internal company policies or local, state, and federal laws. Quadrant I
decisions are clearly to be avoided as they are not legal or ethical. Quadrant II decisions present
an interesting dilemma since they are legal, but yet are not ethical. Making such a decision
may not have punitive ramifications, but will have a negative impact on your professional
reputation. Quadrant III decisions certainly feel right and are tempting, since they are moral
but not legal. It is in Quadrants II and III where most moral dilemmas take place. Taken
together, II and III represent opportunities for reform, to change the system positively so
that ethical choices are legal and unethical choices are illegal. Left uncorrected, both lead
to cynicism with the system, whether it is company policy or the legal system. Correcting
them may take longer to address than the immediate dilemma, but have the potential for high
payoff. Clearly, quadrant IV decisions are best and the goal in the decision process.

                                    ethical

yes III                          IV

no  I                            II

    no                           yes

                                      legal

Figure 11.2: A 2x2 matrix for ethical decision making [Die00].

    One way to evaluate a decision is through what is known as the newspaper test. The idea is
to ask whether you would be comfortable if the decision were published in a newspaper for all to
see. Advice from trusted friends or colleagues can be valuable, but if they are impacted by the
decision, they may not be a good source. Many companies have an ethics office that provides
guidance to which employees can turn. The IEEE and Online Ethics Center for Engineering
and Science co-sponsor an ethics help-line at www.OnlineEthics.org, where ethical questions
can be submitted.

    There may be situations in which you are put in an ethical dilemma by your employer that
cannot be resolved internally. As a last resort, you may go outside of the company to the press
or a government agency to report the problem. This is known as being a whistleblower. An
example of this is the space shuttle Challenger accident, in which the explosion was caused by
O-ring failures in the booster rockets made by Morton-Thiokol. The engineers and scientists
recommended against the launch, but their superiors at NASA and Morton-Thiokol went
ahead over their objections. The engineers later "blew the whistle" by going public with this
information. Although it was too late to avert the disaster, it was valuable in revealing what
had happened and preventing future mishaps. The following criteria should be satisfied when
considering becoming a whistleblower [Deg81]:
202  CHAPTER 11. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES

     The harm to the public must be considerable or serious.

     Concerns must have been made to your superiors (up to the CEO) without satisfactory
       resolution.

     You have documented evidence that would convince an impartial observer that your
       company is wrong. You should have clear technical information to support your claims.

     Release of the information outside of the company will prevent the harm.

    Whistleblowing does have risks, particularly loss of job, but the risks may be well worth it.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 improved federal protection of whistleblowers in the wake of
corporate scandals in the 1990s.

11.5 Case Study Analysis

A good way to develop decision-making skills is by examining case studies. We now go through
the steps of analyzing a case study, employing the IEEE Code of Ethics as a guide. In order
to do so, we apply a paradigm that is a modification of the one used by Lockheed Martin
Corporation in their employee ethics training programs [Loc97]. The modified paradigm is as
follows:

   1. Gather information. What things are known about the situation, but also very impor-
       tantly, what isn't known, and what assumptions are being made?

   2. Identify the stakeholders. Who will be affected by the decision? They may include you,
       your company, your supervisors, your professional colleagues, your profession, the public,
       and users of your products.

   3. Consider what ethical values are relevant to this situation. Identify the elements of the
       IEEE Code of Ethics and legal issues that apply to the situation.

   4. Determine a course of action. Identify different alternative decisions and actions. Select
       the one that you believe best meets the interests of the stakeholders and the ethical
       values.

    Example 11.17 demonstrates the application of this paradigm to a case study for a flawed
chip design. More case studies are provided in the end of chapter problems.

     Example 11.17 Ethics case study for a flawed chip design. (Texas A&M
    Ethics Case studies, http://ethics.tamu.edu. Reprinted by permission.)

    Your company has designed a chip for a new scientific calculator that features high-
    precision floating-point accuracy to 17 significant digits for all 250 mathematical functions
    provided. After one-and-a-half years in development, and after shipping over 500 beta
    units to key customers, the company discovers a problem with certain calculations. In
    addition, the company has manufactured 5000 more calculators with this chip that are
    ready to be shipped.

        In order to expedite floating point operations (used in handling scientific notation in
    mathematical operations) in a computer or calculator, certain tables of values often are
    used to assist in the speed of execution. (For example, a calculator requiring as long as
    3 minutes to perform a tangent calculation would have no market appeal.) These tables
11.5. CASE STUDY ANALYSIS  203

can contain up to 100 integer entries. During beta testing, you discover that several of
these values were incorrectly entered before burning them into the firmware.

    Further testing concludes that because of the location and use of these table errors,
the only mathematical results affected will occur in the 13th to the 17th significant digits
for the double precision floating point operations. Your management is applying subtle
pressure to release the chips due to the time and money invested in the project so far.
Identify a plan of action.

    Discussion:
    Step 1: Gather information
    The information makes it clear that the calculator may fail if precision beyond the
13th digit is needed. What is not known is the standard precision of a calculator. An
Internet search of calculator specifications was conducted, and it was found that most
scientific calculators have a 10 or 12-digit display plus two digits for the power. Going
to the 13th digit implies a higher than normal precision calculator. A calculator with
17 significant digits would likely be used by scientists and engineers for high precision
calculations.
    Step 2: Identify stakeholders
    The following are possible stakeholders:

     Users of the calculator. In certain situations, the user can make an incorrect calcu-
       lation.

     Public. The users of calculator may perform calculations that could impact safety
       of public. This could be a real possibility given the likely users.

     Company and employees. There are negative ramifications of releasing a faulty
       product. This could result in monetary harm to the employees of the company that
       you work for.

    Step 3: Identify relevant ethical values
    Values from the IEEE Code are identified with a discussion of why they apply:
    1: Release of the faulty calculator has the potential to endanger the safety of the
public.
    3: Need to be honest in stating claims as to the precision of the calculator.
    9: There is clear potential to injure the reputation of the company and its employees.
    In terms of legal issues, the company would be opening itself to claims of negligence,
particularly since the defect was identified prior to release of the product.
    Step 4: Determine a course of action
    Three possible courses of action are:
    A: Release the product as is without notifying the customers. This is not a good choice
due to the potential harm to the safety of the public. This would not pass the newspaper
test. It also may be illegal if the calculator is advertised to work to 17 significant digits.
    B: Use the chips in a different calculator that is only guaranteed to compute at a
lower precision, if such an option exists. The company would have to be producing one,
and the technology would have to be compatible.
    C: Throw away the chips and take a loss on their production and correct the problem.
Conduct testing again to verify that the corrected chips work properly.
204  CHAPTER 11. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES

    Options B and C are both reasonable choices. Option B reduces economic losses,
but acceptance testing should be conducted to make sure they operate properly at the
lower precision. Option C is the safest solution. Option A might be seen as a viable
choice, however, since it could be reasoned that handheld calculators are not often used
for safety critical applications. That is a risky assumption and the potential negative
effects are great. Also note that the ideal situation would have been to develop a test
plan (Chapter 7) that would have caught this error before release.

11.6 Project Application: Incorporating Ethics in the Design
         Process

There are good design practices that can be followed to minimize the chances that a product
will be unsafe. The first and most important issue is to identify safety and health factors that
impact the system and address them in the design. Its importance is reflected clearly as the
first item in the IEEE Code of Ethics. It is a fundamental canon in virtually all professional
engineering ethical codes. Be aware that there are often tradeoffs between economic and safety
constraints and one may be satisfied at the expense of the other. It is also important to follow
good practices throughout the design process. Ways that ethical considerations are included
throughout the design process are:

     Conduct research so that prior art is understood. This will minimize conflicts over intel-
       lectual property ownership.

     Make sure that the requirements meet the needs of the stakeholders. If they do not, the
       wrong system will be designed. This is the concept of validation that was addressed
       in Chapter 3. Be honest and realistic in making claims about what the system can do
       and realize that all have limitations. There is often tension between engineering and
       marketing functions of an organization, with engineers often believing that marketing is
       overstating the capabilities of the product. A properly developed Requirements Speci-
       fication is an effective tool for communicating the proposed system functionality to all
       parties.

     Identify and apply safety standards. There are many codes and guidelines that address
       safety in design for particular technologies. They should be identified and applied as
       necessary. For example, it may be wise to design a consumer product to meet UL
       (Underwriter's Laboratory) guidelines. It may difficult to fully incorporate guidelines
       in a capstone design project, depending upon the complexity of the design and the
       standards. However, consideration should be given to identifying those that apply.

     Keep the design space large and explore as many solutions as possible. The hallmark of
       design is that there is typically no single solution to the problem, but many that may
       satisfice. Satisfice means that a solution may meet the design requirements, but may
       not be the optimal solution. It is important to fully understand the technical tradeoffs
       involved in a given design and their impact on health and safety.

     Consider all of the possible ways that a system can fail. This follows the IEEE Code
       of Ethics, which indicates that engineers should understand technology, its application,
       and potential consequences. This can be done formally through the use of techniques
       such as failure mode analysis and the examination of system reliability (Chapter 8).
       In safety critical systems, the use of redundant systems may be warranted to improve
11.7. SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING  205

       reliability. An excellent example of a technical design that incorporates redundancy in
       a safety critical application for a hot tub controller is found in the article Designing for
       Reliability, Maintainability, and Safety by George Novacek in Circuit Cellar magazine
       [Nov00, Nov01].

     Identify ways in which the system can fail by misuse or operator error. This requires
       thinking like a beginner who is completely unfamiliar with the technology. Provide
       manuals for operation and safety labels where appropriate.

     Make realistic cost and project schedule estimates. The IEEE Code of Ethics indicates
       that engineers should be honest and realistic in stating claims, and this applies to the
       project plan as well as the system cost.

     Conduct design reviews. The purpose of a design review is to have peers who are knowl-
       edgeable about the design and the technology conduct a review of the work you have
       done. This can be a humbling, but valuable, experience. It is also in keeping with the
       IEEE Code of Ethics, which indicates that engineers should seek, accept, and offer honest
       criticism of technical work and acknowledge and correct errors.

     Verify the engineering requirements during testing. We saw in Chapter 3 that verification
       is the process of showing that the system is built properly. Verification usually occurs at
       the end of a project at a time that there may be a great deal of pressure to complete the
       tests and finish the project.

11.7 Summary and Further Reading

This chapter provided a brief overview of ethics, morality, and different ethical decision making
systems. The IEEE Code of Ethics was presented, which serves as a set of ethical values for
the electrical and computer engineering profession and provides a basis for analyzing ethical
dilemmas. Legal issues surrounding intellectual property and product liability were provided.
Advice for incorporating safety and ethics in design projects was provided as well as a paradigm
for analyzing case studies.

    The background on ethical frameworks and its importance in engineering came from a
number of articles. The article What has Ethics to do with me?: I am an Engineer [Gob99]
provides background on rule-based ethics, universality, and transitivity. A Piercian Approach
to Professional Ethics Instruction [Cha02b] addressed ethical decision-making frameworks.
Ethical Considerations in the Engineering Design Process [Van01] emphasizes the need to keep
the design space as large as possible. The article Integrating Ethics and Design [Mcl93] does a
good job of describing three different levels of ethical decision making in technical, professional,
and social contexts. The two engineering design textbooks by Dieter [Die00] and Hyman
[Hym98] are good resources on legal and intellectual property issues. The United States Patent
and Trademark Office has an excellent website (www.uspto.gov) with information on patents,
applying for a patent, and a searchable patent database. The website www.HowStuffWorks.com
is also a good source on ethical theory, patents, and legal issues surrounding product liability.

            Case Study: Disk Drive Diagnostics. (Copyright John Wallberg. Reprinted by
            permission.)

            SCSI, an industry standard system for connecting devices (like disks) to com-
            puters, provides a vendor ID protocol by which the computer can identify the
            supplier (and model) of every attached disk.

            Company C makes file servers consisting of a processor and disks. Disks sold
            by C identify C in their vendor ID. Disks from other manufacturers can be
            connected to C's file servers; however, the file server software performs cer-
            tain maintenance functions, notably pre-failure warnings based on performance
            monitoring, only on C-supplied disks.

            Company P decides to compete with C by supplying cheaper disks for C's file
            server. They quickly discover that while their disks work on C's file servers,
            their disks lack a pre-failure warning feature that C's disks have. Therefore,
            the CEO of P directs you, the engineer in charge of the disk product, to find a
            solution to the problem of no pre-failure warning for your disks. Using reverse
            engineering, you discover that by changing the vendor ID of P's disks, the C file
            servers will treat P disks as C disks. Your management at company P instructs
            you to incorporate this change into your product so that you can advertise the
            disks as "100% C-compatible." What would you do in this situation?

            Case Study: Encryption Software (Texas A&M Ethics Case Studies, http:
            //ethics.tamu.edu. Reprinted by permission.)

            You are a recently hired engineer who has been recruited directly out of college.
            For your first assignment, your boss asked you to write a piece of software to
            provide security from "prying eyes" over emailed documents; these documents
            would be used internally by the company. This software will subsequently be
            distributed to different departments.
            Upon completion of this software project, you saw a program on the local
            news about an individual in California who has made similar software available
            overseas. This individual is currently under prosecution in a federal court for
            the distribution of algorithms and information which (by law) must remain
            within the United States for purposes of national security.
            It occurs to you that your company is a multinational corporation and that
            the software might have been distributed overseas. You then discover that the
            software has indeed been sent overseas to other offices within the corporation.
            You speak with your boss, informing him of the news program from the night
            before. He shrugs off this comment, stating that "The company is based in the
            United States and we are certainly no threat to national security in any way.
            Besides, there's no way anyone will find out about software we use internally."
            You agree with your boss, and let it go. Later on however, you receive a
            letter from a gentleman working as a contractor for his company overseas.
            Through some correspondence regarding the functionality of the software and
            technical matters, you learn that the Middle Eastern office had been supplying
            his software outside the company to contractors and clients so that they could
            exchange secure emailed documents. What would you do in this situation?

            Case Study: A Failure. (Texas A&M Ethics Case Studies, http://ethics.
            tamu.edu. Reprinted by permission.)
            You work for Velky Measurement which has for years provided DGC Corpo-
            ration with sophisticated electronic equipment for patient health monitoring
            systems. Recently, DGC returned a failed piece of measurement equipment.
            A meeting was held with representatives of Velky and DGC to discuss the
            problem. This included you and your project manager who is intimately ac-
            quainted with the returned equipment. During the course of the meeting it
            becomes apparent to you that the problem has to be Velky's. You suspect that
            the equipment failed because of an internal design problem and that it was
            not properly tested. However, at the conclusion of the meeting your project
            manager represents Velky's official position--the test equipment is functioning
            properly.
            You keep silent during the meeting, but afterwards talk to your project manager
            about his diagnosis. You suggest that Velky tell DGC that the problem is due
            to a design fault and that Velky will replace the defective equipment. You
208  CHAPTER 11. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES

           manager replies, "I don't think it's wise to acknowledge that it's our fault.
           There's no need to hang out our wash and lessen DGC's confidence in the
            quality of our work. A good will gesture to replace the equipment should suffice."
            Utlimately, Velky's management replaces the equipment because DGC has been
            such a good customer. Although Velky replaces the equipment at its own
            expense, it does not disclose the real nature of the problem. What would you
            do in this situation?

     Case Study: A Vacation (Texas A&M Ethics Case Studies, http://ethics.
     tamu.edu. Reprinted by permission.)

     You work for Rancott and were looking forward to an upcoming trip for weeks.
     Once you were assigned to help install Rancott's equipment for Boulding Cor-
     poration, you arranged a vacation at a nearby ski resort. The installation was
     scheduled to be completed on the 12th and your vacation would begin on the
     13th. That meant a full week of skiing with three of your old college buddies.

     Unfortunately, not all of the equipment arrived on time. Eight of the ten
     identical units were installed by mid-morning on the 12th. Even if the remaining
     two units had arrived that morning, it would take another full day to install
     them. However, you were informed that it might take as long as two more days
     for the units to arrive.

     "Terrific," you sighed, "there goes my vacation--and all the money I put down
     for the condo." "No problem," replied Jerry, the Boulding engineer who had
     worked side-by-side with you as each of the first eight units was installed. He
     said "I can handle this for you. We did the first eight together. It's silly for
     you to have to hang around and blow your vacation." Jerry knew why you were
     sent to supervise the installation of the new equipment. It had to be properly
     installed in order to avoid risking injuries to those who use it. Although you
     are aware of this, you are confident that Jerry is fully capable to supervise the
     installation of the remaining two units. What would you do?

Oral Presentations

       Nothing should be explained in a way that it cannot be understood by an intelligent
       12 year old.--Albert Einstein

    We can all probably remember the anticipation of our first oral presentation--the sweaty
palms, butterflies in the stomach, and the pressure of trying to remember all the points to be
made. Then there is the fear associated with standing up in front of peers or teachers and
presenting ideas to have them openly criticized. According to a 1973 London Times survey,
Americans are more afraid of speaking in front of groups than dying. Perhaps this is due to
the fact that although people know they will die someday, the danger associated with giving
a presentation is more imminent and a greater concern. Somewhere in the capstone design
experience, it is likely that you will have to make an oral presentation. Examples are the project
proposal, a mid-term design review, and the final presentation. The ability to communicate
your ideas is important beyond your academic career, since practicing engineers are often
required to make oral presentations. Further, your overall ability to communicate influences
how others will accept your ideas and act upon them--those who communicate clearly are held
in high regard by their peers and tend to advance more quickly. The good news is that there
is help to overcome the fear of oral presentations. With practice and adherence to some basic
principles, one can become a competent, if not excellent, communicator.

By the end of this chapter, the reader should:

     Understand how people evaluate oral presentations.

210  CHAPTER 12. ORAL PRESENTATIONS

12.1 How People Evaluate Presentations

It is informative to understand how your audience responds to and evaluates oral presenta-
tions. Listening to a presentation is strongly associated with what is referred to as right-brain
activity. Right-brain activity is dominated by emotion and intuition, while left-brain activity
is associated with logical thinking and reason. This is an oversimplified model of the brain,
but the point is that emotion and intuition are important elements that people rely on when
evaluating a presentation.

    There are three elements, known as the "three V's," that constitute a presentation: the
verbal, the vocal, and the visual. Verbal is what the speaker says--the actual words and
content that come out of the speaker's mouth. Vocal is indicative of how it is said, and
includes pitch, enthusiasm, inflection, and intonation. Visual is what the audience sees--the
speaker's appearance, eye contact, posture, facial expressions, and gestures. All three factors
go into the evaluation of speakers, but what is the relative importance of each? The results
of a 1964 UCLA study by Dr. Albert Mehrabian (who has bachelors and masters degrees
in engineering and a Ph.D. in psychology) indicates that the impact of the three elements
is 7% verbal, 38% vocal, and 55% visual. That seems disappointing because we would like
to think that the content of the presentation is most important. Realize that the numbers
come from a simplified study and it is likely that that the percentages would be different for a
highly technical audience. The point is that content is important, but the other elements can't
be ignored. If the visual and vocal aspects of the presentation are poor, it will be perceived
negatively and make it difficult for the audience to accept and pay attention to the information
presented.

    Here is another consideration to think about the next time you make a presentation or
meet somebody. In the first seven seconds of meeting someone, people typically form a great
number of subconscious opinions about the person they meet [Bai81]. This includes the person's
income level, education level, competence, character, trustworthiness, personality, confidence,
intelligence, work ethic, and dependability. Based on what factors are the opinions made?
They include appearance, dress, posture, and speech patterns.

12.2 Preparing the Presentation

In order to make an effective presentation, the presenter must understand the subject matter
(substance counts), understand the needs of the audience, and prepare the presentation. The
remainder of this section provides guidance for preparing the presentation.

Analyze the Audience

An oral presentation is for the benefit of the audience, not the presenter. It is necessary to
analyze and understand the audience's needs and prepare the presentation to meet them. For
example, a presentation for engineering professors would likely be different from one for your
family and friends. Analyzing the audience is no different than the process that one goes
through when writing a document. Some questions to ask in this process are [Bai81]:

     What are they interested in?

     What do they want from your talk?

     What does the audience already know about my subject?

     What don't they know?
12.2. PREPARING THE PRESENTATION  211

     What is the attitude of the audience towards me and my subject?

     What are the values of the audience?

     What do you want them to know or learn?

    Understanding the needs of the audience and putting their interests first establishes credi-
bility so that they are more willing to accept the content of the presentation.

    Before creating the presentation, identify the main points that the audience should take
away from it. A rule of thumb is to identify three main points for a talk, as people tend to
forget more than that. Although it is not a strict rule, keep the number of points in that range,
say two to five. Once the points are identified, organize the presentation to support them.

Organize the Presentation

Just like a story, a presentation has an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. This is en-
capsulated in the often-heard wisdom for presentations to "tell them what you are going to
tell them" (the introduction), "tell it to them" (the body), and "tell them what you just told
them" (the conclusion).

    The introduction is absolutely critical--if the audience does not understand the presentation
from the outset, they will tune out. Einstein's advice that nothing should be explained in such
a way that it cannot be understood by an intelligent 12 year old is particularly relevant here.
Take time to explain the problem in simple terms. Part of an effective introduction is obtaining
the interest of the audience. There are many ways to accomplish this, and examples include
the use of rhetorical questions or the narration of an experience that the audience can relate
to. This should have to do in some way with the information being presented. Overall, the
objective is to motivate the audience by describing what is being presented and why it is
important. After giving motivation of the problem, an overview of the talk can be provided.
The overview should be relevant to the problem at hand, not a generic one that can apply to
virtually any presentation.

    Structure the body of the presentation to support the main points. This is done by having
a group of two to four related slides that support each of the main points. The first slide of
the group provides some key ideas, followed by the remaining slides that go into more detail
on the particular point. Don't make the talk unnecessarily technical or use a lot of jargon.
This does not mean that it should not have technical content, but that judgment should be
exercised in presenting the right amount of detail. The level of technical detail depends upon
the education and experience of the audience. If it is necessary to use jargon or acronyms, make
sure that they are defined for the audience. Consider alternative ways of explaining things.
The use of analogies is particularly powerful when explaining complex and abstract material.
One strategy is to increase the level of complexity as the talk proceeds. That way, much of the
early material will be understandable to the majority of the audience, while the latter more
complex material may only be understood by a small fraction. Everybody will then leave the
presentation with some understanding of the content.

    In a typical engineering classroom lecture, the professor usually goes through many steps in
defining and deriving equations. Realize that the goals of a classroom lecture are very different
from that of an oral presentation. When working with equations, don't derive or give too many
intermediate steps, unless that is the point of the presentation. Provide assumptions, selected
intermediate equations, and the important results. Audiences generally assume you have done
your homework and derived the equations properly. There is a tendency to present equations,
vaguely refer to them, and then move on. Equations should be presented for a reason, so
212  CHAPTER 12. ORAL PRESENTATIONS

talk about them and describe their significance. Every equation has its own story; it is the
presenter's job to tell it. The same is also true of graphs and plots.

    The conclusion provides the opportunity to summarize and emphasize the main points of
the presentation. Again, tell them what you told them by reviewing the important points and
conclusions. That way if somebody was lost during the presentation, they can understand the
importance of the work. If there are recommendations to be made for future action, address
them here. The conclusion is also an opportunity to explain the next steps for the project.

Lay Out the Slides

Below are pointers for the layout of the slide content.

     Use a large font. This ensures that information on the slides can easily be seen by the
       audience. 24 point or greater font is typically sufficient.

     Have a goal of five-to-seven bullet points per page. Avoid the tendency to cram as much
       information as possible on a page, which is often done so that the presenter does not ne-
       glect any material. Avoid this, and use five to seven bullet points to guide the discussion.
       Presentation software packages, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, allow you to introduce
       bullet items one at a time, which help to keep the discussion on track.

     Avoid fancy graphics and special effects that add no value. Presentation packages allow
       the addition of fancy features, such as spiraling text and sound effects. They add little to
       the presentation and when overused distract from the content. The content and material
       are what matter the most, not fancy formatting and special effects. To quote Edward
       Tuft, professor emeritus at Yale,

       Power Corrupts, PowerPoint Corrupts Absolutely.

       His point is that fancy graphics and features are used far too much with PowerPoint pre-
       sentation software, and that this overpowers both the content and the audience. [Tuf03].

     Group slides together to make a major point. Make the first slide the general one with
       key statements. The following ones should have more detailed information supporting
       the point.

     Do not create a canned talk or speech. That is acceptable in some fields, but not in
       engineering and science where a more extemporaneous style is the norm. Let the bullet
       points and other material on the slides serve as guides for what to say. Avoid the use of
       cue cards and do not just read directly from the slides for the presentation.

Meet the Time Constraints

Make sure that the presentation falls within the time constraints--the audience will be alienated
if it is far too short or too long. The tendency is to exceed the time limit since there is so
much information that the presenter wants to convey. You may be abruptly cut off and not be
able to conclude the presentation if the time limit is exceeded. Think about this--how would
you describe all that you know about electrical or computer engineering in ten minutes? It is
challenging, but if you only had ten minutes you would probably give a brief overview of the
major accomplishments made in the field. Accept that all of the information can't be conveyed
in the given time and use it carefully to highlight the important material.

    A heuristic is to take the length of the allotted time in minutes and divide it by two. That
provides an estimate of the number of slides to prepare. Once the presentation is prepared,
12.3. PROJECT APPLICATION: DESIGN PRESENTATIONS  213

practice to see if it can be presented reasonably in the time allotted. Practice the talk in front
of your teammates, boyfriend, girlfriend, mother, or pet rock. Be careful not to over-prepare
to the point of sounded scripted. Practice the talk the night before the presentation and only
do a brief review of the material right before the talk. Be sure to allow time for the question
and answer session that usually occurs at the end of a presentation.

Prepare for the Question and Answer Session

One of the biggest fears of presenters is the dreaded question and answer session. This is where
the audience gets to ask questions and possibly expose the presenter for what they don't know.
For example, the questioner may ask "Are you familiar with the work of Johnson and Smith
from 1984 in which they proposed exactly the same idea as yours?"

    How do you prepare for this? You must be knowledgeable about the subject, but you don't
need to have the answers to every possible question. It is good practice to rephrase questions
that are asked for the benefit of you, the audience, and the questioner. Rephrasing the question
ensures that you are answering the correct question (how many times have you been annoyed
when a teacher answered the wrong question?) and provides time to think and formulate a
response. It demonstrates to the questioner that you understand their question and are able
to present it in a different format. If the questioner is hostile, make sure that you rephrase
the question in a positive light. Rephrasing is also a courtesy for the other members of the
audience who may have not heard or understood the question.

    Most questions are made in good faith as the questioner is trying to clarify a point or learn
more. Sometimes, questioning can become hostile or aggressive. If this happens, make sure
not to respond in kind or put the questioner down. The presenter has the position of power
and becomes a bully if they do this. Be sure to maintain eye contact with the questioner,
smile, and remain relaxed in your responses. If you can't answer the question, admit it and
don't try to come up with a phony answer. If the questioner is persistent, offer to discuss it in
more detail with them after the presentation.

12.3 Project Application: Design Presentations

Examples of the three presentations that you may make during the design process are listed in
Table 12.1. It is a guide of points to consider preparing presentations and should be adjusted
to meet particular needs of the situation. The checklist in Table 12.2 is provided to aid in
preparing for presentations.

12.4 Summary and Further Reading

During the design process and your professional career, you will need to communicate ideas
effectively. One of the most common ways to do this is via an oral presentation. Visual,
verbal, and vocal aspects impact the effectiveness of an oral presentation. Although the verbal
aspect, or content, is important, the visual and vocal delivery aspects heavily influence the
audience's perception and cannot be overlooked. In preparing the presentation, the needs and
background of the audience should be taken into consideration and the main points to be
conveyed identified. Creating the presentation is much like telling a story--there should be an
introduction, a body, and a conclusion that are organized to support the main points. The
slides should be grouped to support these points. Concepts should be explained as simply
and clearly as possible. Increasing the complexity as the presentation proceeds will allow the
presentation to reach all members of the audience to some extent. Practicing the presentation

is especially important for novice presenters, and tips were provided for meeting the time
constraints and preparing for question sessions.

    There are many excellent resources and articles available regarding oral presentations. A
concise and humorous article geared for new speakers in the technical fields is Advice to Be-
ginning Physics Speakers by James Garland [Gar91]. The
IEEE Transactions on Professional Communications journal addresses many aspects of com-
munications including oral presentations. Mindtools (www.mindtools.com) has a section on
communication skills that includes a preparation checklist on presentation, delivery, appear-
ance, and visual aids. A Good Speech is Worth a Thousand Words by Bert Decker [Dec84]
addresses right and left brain thinking as well as the three V's of giving a presentation. The
article How to Overcome Errors in Public Speaking by John Baird [Bai81] addresses how to
analyze the audience, the judgments that are made when meeting a person, the introduction,
and conclusion. Other resources used in the preparation of this chapter include: The En-
gineering Presentation--Some Ideas on How to Approach and Present It [Ros93], Handling
a Hostile Audience--With Your Eyes [Car89], and How to Speak so that Facts Come Alive
[Ste89]. Many of the references are compiled in the book
Writing and Speaking in the Technology Professions: A Practical Guide edited by David Beer
[Bee03].

acceptance test
                   An acceptance test verifies that the system meets the Requirements
activity on node   Specification and stipulates the conditions under which the customer
                   will accept the system (Chapter 7).
activity
activity view      A form of a network diagram used in a project plan. In the Activ-
                   ity on Node (AON) form, activities are represented by nodes and the
Analytical Hi-     dependencies by arrows (Chapter 10).
erarchy Process
(AHP)              An activity is a combination of a task and its associated deliverables
                   that is part of a project plan (Chapter 10).
artifact
automated script   The activity view is part of the Unified Modeling Language. It is
test               characterized by an activity diagram; its intention is to describe the
                   sequencing of processes required to complete a task (Chapter 6).
baseline require-
ments              A decision-making process that combines both quantitative and quali-
                   tative inputs. It is characterized by weighted criteria against which the
                   decision is made, a numeric ranking of alternatives, and computation of
                   a numerical score for each alternative (Appendix B and Chapters 2 and
                   4).

                   System, component, or process that is the end-result of a design (Chap-
                   ter 2).

                   An automated script test is a sequence of commands given to a unit
                   under test. For example, a test may consist of a sequence of inputs
                   that are provided to the unit, where the outputs for each input are then
                   verified against pre-specified values (Chapter 7).

                   The original set of requirements that are developed for a system (Chap-

black box test
bottom-up design    A test that is performed without any knowledge of internal workings of
                    the unit under test (Chapter 7).
Bohrbug
                    An approach to system design where the designer starts with basic com-
brainstorming       ponents and synthesizes them to achieve the design objectives. This is
                    contrasted to top-down design (Chapter 5).
Brainwriting
                    Bohrbugs are reliable bugs, in which the error is always in the same
break-even point    place. This is analogous to the electrons in the Bohr atomic model
                    which assume a definite orbit (Chapter 7).
bug
cardinality ratio   A freeform approach to concept generation that is often done in groups.
                    This process employs five basic rules: 1) no criticism of ideas, 2) wild
class               ideas are encouraged, 3) quantity is stressed over quality, 4) build upon
cohesion            the ideas of others, and 5) all ideas are recorded (Chapter 4).
component de-
sign specification  A variation of brainstorming where a group of people systematically
concept fan         generate ideas and write them down. Ideas are then passed to other
concept genera-     team members who must build upon them.

concept table       The break-even point is the point where the number of units sold is such
                    that there is no profit or loss. It is determined from the total costs and
                    revenue (Chapter 10).

                    A problem or error in a system that causes it to operate incorrectly
                    (Chapter 7).

                    The cardinality ratio describes the multiplicity of the entities in a rela-
                    tionship. It is applied to entity relationship diagrams and Unified
                    Modeling Language static view diagrams (Chapter 6).

                    Classes are used in object-oriented system design. A class defines the
                    attributes and methods (functions) of an object (Chapter 6).

                    Refers to how focused a module is--highly cohesive systems do one or a
                    few things very well. Also see coupling (Chapter 5).

                    the problem are identified (Chapter 1).

                    A tool for generating concepts to solve a problem. It allows systematic
                    examination of different combinations, arrangements, and substitutions
                    of different elements for a system. Also see concept fan (Chapter 4).

                   individual can break a rule. This is generally because it is believed that
constraint         the moral good of the situation outweighs the rule. Also see rule-based
                   ethics (Chapter 11).
controllability
copyright          A special type of requirement that encapsulates a design decision im-
                   posed by the environment or a stakeholder. Constraints often violate
coupling           the abstractness property of engineering requirements (Chapter 3).

creative design    A principle that applies to testing. Controllability is the ability to set
critical path      any node of the system to a prescribed value (Chapter 7).
cross-functional
team               Copyrights protect published works such as books, articles, music, and
data dictionary    software. A copyright means that others cannot distribute copyrighted
                   material without permission of the owner (Chapter 11).
data flow dia-
gram               Modules are coupled if they depend upon each other in some way to
decision matrix    operate properly. Coupling is the extent to which modules or subsystems
                   are connected. See also cohesion (Chapter 5).

                   A formal categorization of design projects. Creative designs represent
                   new and innovative designs (Chapter 2).

                   The path with the longest duration in a project plan. It represents the
                   minimum time required to complete the project (Chapter 10).

                   Cross-functional teams are those that are composed of people from differ-
                   ent organizational functions, such as engineering, marketing, and man-
                   ufacturing. Also see multi-disciplinary team (Chapter 9).

                   A dictionary of data contained in a data flow diagram. It contains
                   specific information on the data flows and is defined using a formal lan-
                   guage (Chapter 6).

                   The intention of a data flow diagram (DFD) is to model the processing
                   and flow of data inside a system (Chapter 6).

                   A matrix that is used to evaluate and rank concepts. It integrates both
                   the user-needs and the technical merits of different concepts (Chapter 4).

derating           A decrease in the maximum amount of power that can be dissipated by
                   a device. The amount of derating is based upon operating conditions,
                   notably increases in temperature (Chapter 8).

deliverable        Deliverables are entities that are delivered to the project based upon
                   completion of tasks. Also see activity (Chapter 10).

                  no further and the identification of elements such as circuit components,
event table       logic gates, or software code takes place (Chapter 5).

failure function  A requirement of the system that applies to the technical aspects of the
failure rate      design. An engineering requirement should be abstract, unambiguous,
fixed costs       verifiable, traceable, and realistic (Chapter 3).

                  An ERD is used to model database systems. The intention of an ERD
                  is to catalog a set of related objects (entities), their attributes, and the
                  relationships between them (Chapter 6).

                  A matrix that is used to identify relationships between entities in a
                  database system (Chapter 6).

                  choices to be made (Chapter 11).

                  An event is an occurrence at a specific time and place that needs to be
                  remembered and taken into consideration in the system design (Chap-
                  ter 6).

                  A table that is used to store information about events in the system. It
                  includes information regarding the event trigger, the source of the event,
                  and process triggered by the event (Chapter 6).

                  The failure function, F (t), is a mathematical function that provides the
                  probability that a device has failed at time t (Chapter 8).

                  The failure rate, (t), for a device is the expected number of device
                  failures that will occur per unit time (Chapter 8).

                  Fixed costs are those that are constant regardless of the number of units
                  produced and cannot be directly charged to a process or activity (Chap-
                  ter 10).

Decision Making with Analytical
Hierarchy Process

Making good decisions is a crucial skill at every level.--Peter Drucker

    A hallmark of design is that many decisions must be made throughout the process. Typ-
ically, there are alternative solutions to a problem from which the best one relative to some
criteria is selected. This appendix presents the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach
to decision making. AHP is a flexible quantitative and qualitative method that is applicable
to many problems which provides a numerical score for the alternatives considered. Different
aspects of AHP are applied throughout the text and this appendix is structured to teach AHP
via example. A summary of AHP is provided at the conclusion of the appendix.

    To apply AHP there must be a decision to be made, criteria against which the decision
is based, and a set of competing decisions from which one must be selected. This process is
encapsulated in the decision matrix shown in Table B.1 and as such the process is sometimes
referred to as the decision-matrix method. The row headings are the criteria against which
the decision is made and the column headings represent the alternatives. The criteria can
have differing levels of importance and their relative weightings are reflected by i values in
the matrix. The entries in the matrix, ij, are ratings for each jth alternative relative to ith
criterion. Each alternative receives a score, Sj, which is a weighted sum of the ratings that is
computed as

                                     m                                   (B.1)

                          Sj = iij

                                    i=1

The steps of AHP are to:

1. Determine the selection criteria.
2. Determine the criteria weightings.
3. Identify and rate alternatives relative to the criteria.
4. Compute scores for the alternatives.

   5. Review the decision.

    AHP is demonstrated through two examples in which the decision to purchase a car is
considered. This example has the benefit of being relatively easy to understand, has readily
available public data for supporting the decision, demonstrates the principles of AHP clearly,
and is extensible to design problems. The first example demonstrates a straightforward set of
criteria, while the second extends to hierarchical criteria.

B.1 Applying AHP for Car Selection

AHP is demonstrated in this section by examining the decision to purchase an automobile.

Step 1: Determine the Selection Criteria
The first step is to brainstorm to identify the criteria against which the decision is made - ideally
it is done prior to identification of the alternatives. The pitfall of identifying alternatives first
is that the criteria may be selected to bias towards a particular alternative. Assume that the
criteria determined are:

     Purchase cost

     Safety

     Design styling

     Brand-name recognition

Step 2: Determine the Criteria Weightings
To determine the weights, ij, a method known as pairwise comparison is applied, where
each criterion is systematically compared to all others. For example, the purchase cost is
compared to safety, design, and brand-name. Likewise, safety is compared to the remaining
criteria and so on. A common practice in AHP to apply the following scale for pairwise
comparison and it is used throughout the book for consistency

                1 = equal, 3 = moderate, 5 = strong, 7 = very strong, 9 = extreme.

For example, if one criterion is deemed strongly more important than another, it is assigned
a score of `5', while if it is deemed strongly less important, it is assigned the reciprocal value
`1/5'.
B.1. APPLYING AHP FOR CAR SELECTION                                       233

    Example comparisons are captured in the comparison matrix in Table B.2. For each cell, the
corresponding row criterion is compared to the column criterion. From the first row of the table
it is apparent that purchase cost is considered of equal importance to safety, moderately more
important than design, and very strongly more important than brand-name. By definition,
the diagonal elements are assigned values of 1 since each is equally important to itself. The
matrix should have the following relationship about the diagonal, xij = 1/xji.

               Table B.2: Pairwise comparison of the selection criteria.

Purchase cost  Purchase cost  Safety  Design  Brand name
     Safety             1        1        3           7
     Design             1        1        5           9
                       1/3      1/5       1           3
 Brand-name            1/7      1/9                   1
                                        1/3

    People often make comparisons that are inconsistent. Look at the first row - purchase cost
and safety are deemed to be equally important, while cost is moderately more important than
design (factor of 3). Yet, in the second row safety is seen as strongly more important than
design (by a factor of 5). This is inconsistent, since if we are to believe the first row, then
safety would be only moderately more important than design (by a factor of 3) - just as the
purchase cost was compared relative to safety in the first row.

    An intuitive approach for computing the weight for each criterion is to sum each row. Since
a given row represents the comparison of a single criterion to all others - the larger a row sum
is the more important it is and the higher the weight it achieves. However, the problem of
inconsistency needs to be addressed. There are a number of approaches that can be shown
mathematically to reduce the inconsistency in the matrix. A simple method is to take the
geometric mean of each row. The geometric mean of a series of numbers, a1, a2, . . . an , is
computed as

               Geometricmean = n a1a2, . . . an.                          (B.2)

    The geometric mean is often used to reduce bias in skewed data. Table B.3 demonstrates
how the weights are computed. First, the geometric mean of each row is computed and then
the sum of the geometric means is found. The mean values are divided by the sum to produce
a normalized set of weights; that is,

                                                           i = 1.

                                                                                 i

    No matter what method is applied to find the weights, they should be normalized to a sum
of one.

                                        1/3

    The criteria have the following weights 1 = 0.37, 1 = 0.46, 1 = 0.12, and 1 = 0.05.
These calculations are easily automated with spreadsheet software.
234 APPENDIX B. DECISION MAKING WITH ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS

Step 3: Identify and Rate Alternatives Relative to the Criteria

The three competing alternatives to be evaluated are the 2006 model year Honda CR-V,
Hyundai Tucson, and Toyota RAV4, which are all small sport-utility vehicles. The ratings of
each alternative relative to each criterion, ij, that make up the body of the decision matrix
are determined next. Ideally, quantitative ratings are determined, but in many cases it is
necessary to use a more qualitative approach. Higher ratings should reflect a better match to
the criteria. Creativity and ingenuity are often needed to determine a proper metric.

    Let's examine purchase cost. The vehicle costs are $21,026 (Honda), $18,183 (Hyundai),
and $21,989 (Toyota). The purchase cost itself cannot be used directly for a rating metric, since
the highest cost would achieve the highest rating, whereas the objective is to minimize cost
and reward the lowest cost with the highest rating. An alternative metric is needed. A metric
that works when the objective is to minimize a criterion is to compare it to the minimum of
all values using the following ratio

                                 min[cost]                              (B.3)
                           =

                                    cost

    This assigns a maximum value of 1 to the lowest cost option, which in this case is the
Hyundai. The cost ratings are computed to be 11 = 0.86, 12 = 1, and 13 = 0.83. It is
important that the ratings relative to each criteria be normalized so that their sum is one. If
not, the sum of ratings for each criterion will be different. This would introduce bias by altering
the relative weights of the criteria. The normalized ratings are 11 = 0.32, 12 = 0.37, and
13 = 0.31.

    Next, a metric for safety is needed. Fortunately, there is real data to draw upon from
the US National Highway Transportation Safety Association (www.safercar.gov) which rates
vehicles in multiple categories on a five-point scale. The average rating for each car is 21 = 4.8
(Honda), 22 = 4.8 (Hyundai), and 23 = 4.6 (Toyota), producing the following normalized
values 21 = 0.34, 21 = 0.34, and 21 = 0.32.

    The rating of the cars relative to the design styling criterion is considered next. This re-
quires a more subjective approach than the previous two criteria. To quantify the subjective
evaluation pairwise comparison is again applied to determine the relative value of one auto-
mobile's design to another. Pairwise comparison for the design styling criteria is shown in
Table B.4. The 2006 CR-V is has older styling, resulting in a much lower design styling rating
than the others.

Table B.4: Pairwise comparison of design styling to determine ratings.

   Honda CRV    Honda CRV  Hyundai Tucson   Toyota RAV4  Design Rating
Hyundai Tucson          1            1/3            1/5          0.11
                        3             1             1/2          0.31
  Toyota RAV4           5             2              1           0.58

    Finally, the ratings for brand-name recognition are determined using pairwise comparison
as shown in Table B.5.

    Note that the pairwise comparison method can be somewhat time-consuming since many
comparisons must be made. When making subjective estimates, a faster approach is to use
scoring rubric that reflects how well each of the alternatives meet the criterion, for example

    1 = does not meet criterion, 5 = partially meets criterion, 9 = completely meets criterion.
    Keep in mind that pairwise comparison has the advantage of a systematic comparison of
alternatives and this reduces inconsistency in ratings.

                        1

Step 4: Compute Scores for the Alternatives

The decision matrix is built and the overall weighted scores for the alternatives are computed
as shown in Table B.6.

                      Table B.6: The decision matrix.

                      Honda CRV Hyundai Tucson Toyota RAV4

Cost            0.37  0.32           0.37              0.31

Safety          0.46  0.34           0.34              0.32

Design styling 0.12   0.11           0.31              0.58

Brand-name 0.05       0.44           0.12              0.44

Score                 0.31           0.34              0.35

Step 5: Review the Decision

The result is a set of numerical scores for the alternatives and if all work is done properly the
final scores should sum to one. In this case there is not much difference between the scores and
a simple decision based upon the maximum value would lead to selection of the RAV4. Since
there is not much of a difference, all three are good choices based upon the selection criteria.
The decision matrix allows the examination of different scenarios as the weights and ratings can
be varied to see how they affect the overall scores. The RAV4 beats the Tucson primarily due
to styling and brand-name, which are both subjective ratings. This might warrant re-visiting
those ratings to see how they impact the decision. The RAV4 barely beats out the Tucson,
so if cost and safety are truly more important, the Tucson is a better decision as it beats the
RAV4 in both of those categories.

B.2 Hierarchical Decision Criteria

The example in the previous section had fairly simple selection criteria and it arguably missed
some important ones, such as the operating costs. Further, when considering operating cost it
becomes apparent that it has multiple dimensions, or sub-criteria, such as fuel and insurance
costs. Similarly, the design styling criterion can be sub-divided into interior and exterior design.
Thus there is a hierarchy in the criteria, giving rise to the name Analytical Hierarchy Process.
The following extends the previous example to include the use of hierarchical criteria.

Step 1: Determine the Selection Criteria

Assume that the criteria have been expanded to be more realistic as shown below:

     Purchase cost
236 APPENDIX B. DECISION MAKING WITH ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS

     Operating costs

          - Fuel
          - Insurance

     Safety
     Design styling

          - Interior
          - Exterior

     Brand-name recognition

Step 2: Determine the Criteria Weightings

Pairwise comparison is again used to determine the weights. The difference now is that this
comparison is done at each level in the hierarchy. First, purchase cost, operating costs, safety,
design, and brand-name recognition are compared. Then fuel and insurance costs are compared
to each other since they are at the same level and grouping in the hierarchy, as are exterior and
interior design. Assume that the pairwise comparisons produce the following criteria weights:

     Purchase cost (0.33)
     Operating Costs (0.11)

          - MPG (0.67)
          - Insurance (0.33)

     Safety (0.40)
     Design Styling (0.12)

          - Interior (0.50)
          - Exterior (0.50)

     Brand-name recognition (0.04)

Step 3: Identify and Rate Alternatives Relative to the Criteria

Utilizing the results from the previous section, it is only necessary to compute scores relative to
the new criteria. Using mileage per gallon as a metric for ratings fuel costs is straightforward,
since the two are directly proportional. This data is readily available and is 24, 23, and 25 miles
per gallon for the CR-V, Tucson, and RAV4 respectively. This produces normalized ratings of
0.33, 0.32, and 0.35 respectively.

    In terms of insurance costs, the National Highway Transportation Safety Institute publishes
the relative average loss per insured vehicle, a rating that is used by insurance companies to
determine insurance costs. A score of 100 is the industry average - those exceeding 100 are
above the average and those less than 100 are below it. The publicly available ratings are
93, 100, and 112 for the CR-V, Tucson, and RAV4 respectively. Again, the objective is to
minimize these values so the metric in equation (3) is used. This produces normalized ratings
of 0.36, 0.34, and 0.30 respectively.

    Styling is subjective and ratings could be determined using a scoring rubric or the pairwise
comparison method. Assume that this produces the scores shown in Table B.7.
B.3. SUMMARY AND FURTHER READING                            237

Step 4: Compute Scores for the Alternatives

The decision-matrix shown in Table B.7 reflects the hierarchical criteria. The scores are com-
puted slightly differently when sub-criteria are involved. For example, the score for operating
costs of the Honda is computed based upon the two sub-criteria as (0.67x0.33 + 0.33x0.36)
= 0.34. The value of 0.34 is then the rating reflected in table for the operating costs of this
vehicle. Then to get the weighted score for operating costs, this result of 0.33 is multiplied by
the weight of 0.11, exactly as in the previous example.

                     Table B.7: The decision matrix.

                     Honda CRV Hyundai Tucson Toyota RAV4

Purchase Cost 0.33   0.32         0.37                0.31

Operating Cost 0.11  0.34         0.32                0.33

Fuel       0.67      0.33         0.32                0.35

Insurance  0.33      0.36         0.34                0.30

Safety     0.40      0.34         0.34                0.32

Design Styling 0.12  0.20         0.40                0.40

Interior   0.60      0.20         0.40                0.40

Exterior   0.40      0.20         0.40                0.40

Brand-name 0.04      0.44         0.12                0.44

Score                0.32         0.35                0.33

Step 5: Review the Decision

With this expanded set of criteria, there is a shift in the overall ranking and the Hyundai
Tucson edges out the Toyota RAV4. Frankly, all three are good choices and reflects the highly
competitive car market. A comparison of vehicles across classes, such as sport-utility, mid-size,
and a luxury car would likely results in a much larger differential in the scoring, based upon
the weighted criteria used here.

B.3 Summary and Further Reading

The Analytical Hierarchy Process is an effective tool for comparing competing alternatives
that integrates both quantitative and qualitative judgments. In order to compare alternatives,
criteria for comparison are selected and the relative weights of the criteria assigned. In terms
of selecting the criteria and their weightings, remember the following:

     Ideally, the criteria are selected prior to identification of the alternatives. This avoids
       the trap of selecting the criteria to support a pre-conceived decision.

     There is no single correct way to compute the criterion weights. However, the pairwise
       comparison approach is well-accepted. It can be a bit time-consuming, particularly when
       a large number of criteria are to be compared. If used properly pairwise comparison
       reduces bias in the decision.

     There are alternatives to pairwise comparison. One is to rank the criterion from most
       important to least important and then assign a relative weighting based upon the rank-
       ing. Another alternative is to utilize a rubric using a semi-qualitative scale, as 1= low
       importance, 5 = medium importance, and 9 = extremely important.
238 APPENDIX B. DECISION MAKING WITH ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS

     Regardless of how the weights are selected, the sum of the weights should be normalized
       to a value of one.

    Once the criteria and weights are found, ratings for each option relative to the criteria are
determined. When computing the ratings, remember the following:

     If quantitative data is available it should be used. It is admittedly hard to determine for
       many problems.

     Appropriate metrics need to be used for rating quantitative data.

     If quantitative data is unavailable, qualitative judgments must be made and quantified.
       Again, the pairwise comparison is a good tool for quantifying such judgments. Alterna-
       tively, a rubric for rating the alternatives against the criteria can be used.

     The ratings relative to each criterion need to be normalized so that their sum is equal to
       one.

    The final result is a decision-matrix and scores for each of the alternatives. This matrix
allows one to see the quantify decisions allowing a rationale approach to decision-making,
minimizing emotional factors in the decision

    AHP was originally developed by Thomas Saaty [Sat88] and has found wide acceptance
since. There are software packages available, such as Expert Choice, that allow for rapid
comparison of alternatives and evaluation

Component Failure Rate Data

This appendix contains failure rate data for selected electronic components in support of Chap-
ter 8. The information was abstracted from the Military Handbook for Reliability Prediction
[MIL-HDBK-217F] and contains information for devices that are relevant to this book. The
information is a close facsimile to MIL-HDBK-217F, but in some instances comments are added
to help interpret the information. Furthermore, MIL-HDBK-217F tends to present both em-
pirical estimation formulas and tabular data computed from the formulas. The tabular data
is generally not included here for simplicity of presentation, and is readily obtained from the
formulas supplied. Data is presented for the following devices:

     Analog components: resistors and capacitors.

     Discrete semiconductors: diodes, bipolar transistors, and field effect transistors.

     Microcircuits: gate/logic arrays and microprocessors.

C.1 Environmental Use

All of the devices presented in this appendix have an environmental factor that is used to
estimate the failure rate. The environmental factors are based on the 14 categories in Table C.1.

C.3 Microelectronic Devices

For all microelectronic devices it is necessary to compute the junction temperature (Tj) of the
silicon in order to determine the temperature factor. The junction temperature is determined
as follows:

 Tj = TA + jAPD

 TA = ambient temperature

 jA = junction to ambient thermal resistance (obtained from manufacture data sheet.)

 PD =power dissipated inm the device

    Author's Note: The equations above are slightly different than those found in MIL-
HDBK-217F. The junction to ambient thermal resistance is used here, instead of junction to
case as in the original. In addition, the ambient temperature is used in place of the case
temperature. This is more general and is consistent with the presentation in Chapter 8. The
junction to case resistance could be used, along with the case temperature. See Section 8.2 for
more detailed coverage of this thermal model.

    The part quality descriptors in Table C.10 are used to find the quality factors.

    1 Problem Statement
1.1 Need

    Visually impaired people often have mobility difficulties due to limited spatial sensing--
determining where objects are. Although many receive education in mobility techniques and
enhance other senses to create better awareness of surroundings, there is a need for a more
accurate spatial description. For example, according to the Vision and Blindness Resources
Center in Erie, visually impaired people are able to detect walls due to different sounds in
the environment. However, a tree branch, stairs, or a street sign may be undetected. Due
to objects that cannot be perceived by sensorial means, many devices have been designed to
detect objects in the path of a visually impaired individual. Common mobility resources are
guide dogs, canes, and electronic travel aid (ETA) devices. Unfortunately, these resources are
either limited or too expensive. There is a need for a device to provide an effective way to
detect objects and be cost-efficient.

    1.2 Objective
The goal is to design and implement a digital system that give visually impaired an enhanced
awareness of their surroundings. The system will detect objects and provide real-time feedback
to the user according to the size, position, and distance of the object.

    1.3 Research Survey
For over 30 years, people have been attempting to invent an electronic device to help the blind
navigate. According to the American Foundation for the Blind [1], there are about 10 million
blind and visually impaired individuals in the United States.

                                                           267
268  APPENDIX E. DESIGN PROJECT CASE STUDY

    According to Seeing Eye [2], an organization committed to train dogs for the blind, around
1% of the visually impaired use guide dogs. Many do not choose this option due to allergies,
facilities needed for dog care, training for both the dog and the individual and finally, personal
preference. The rest of the blind community relies on canes, electronic travel aids (ETA), and
their perceptual senses.

    The cane is the most popular tool for object detection for the blind. Nevertheless, this tool
is limited as it is difficult to locate objects that are not at the ground level. For example a tree
branch will go undetected by an individual using a cane. However, there are ETAs designed to
overcome this problem. The most popular ETA is a cane that contains built-in laser sensors
for object detection called the LaserCane [3]. This system integrates laser sensors near the
handle of the cane and detects objects in 3 different angles. This system provides feedback to
the user by sound or by vibrations produced on the side of the cane sensed by touch. Although
this design offers the blind more resources to identify possible objects in front, it has limited
feedback. For instance, the laser sensors fire a beam so narrow that users must be master
the movements of the cane in order to detect objects accurately. Moreover, this device costs
around $2,500, which places an attainability issue for many visually impaired.

    According to the director of the Vision and Blindness Resources Center in Erie--whom
was interviewed as part of the project's research--the visually impaired are trained to orient
themselves and navigate using their senses. However, major difficulties arise from objects
that cannot be sensed. Therefore, basic mobility needs of visually impaired consist of object
detection with a range of approximately 1 meter from the body, as a minimum, and 2 feet
wide--the width of the body. Such objects may include desks, chairs, steps, and tree branches.
In an interview with a visually impaired student on campus who uses a guide dog said that
surface differences of approximately 2 in. should be considered dangerous, and must be detected
by the ETA system.

    Based on the needs and common hazards that the visually impaired encounter, key charac-
teristics must be carefully addressed when designing an ETA device. First, the sensing system
must be able to detect objects of varied sizes and cover a wide range for ease of detection.
Second, GPS and compasses may be used for orientation. Third, an intuitive feedback system
must be used. Such a system cannot employ sound as this interferes with the hearing of the
visually impaired. Finally, the system must be affordable. Research shows that no single device
meets all these needs and has been widely accepted by the blind community.

    1.4 User Needs and Objective Tree
The team interviewed a number of sources to identify the objectives in the tree below.

    Weightings of the objectives were determined using the pairwise comparison method for all
levels of the objective tree. The results for the highest level of the tree are portability (0.20),
consumer-friendly (0.30), and ease-of-use (0.50). This result arises from the need that the
ETA must be easy to use because an overly complex interface would create a high barrier to
using and then accepting the device. Along the same lines the device should create a minimum
amount of disturbance to the user's environment. Finally, while important portability is the
least of the three concerns.

    2 The Requirements Specification
    The marketing requirements are: (1) Portability, (2) weight, (3) operable enviromnents,
(4) water resistance, (5) operation time, (6) cost, (7) east of use, (8) streamlined controls, (9)
safety, (10 comforable, (11) accurate, (12) noiuse level, (13) consumer-friendly, (14) intuitive
feedback.
    3 The Design
    The Visual Aid device has three major physical components: 1) a set of sensors, 2) a matrix
of vibrating motors and 3) a processing unit. These physical components are interconnected
                                                                                                                       269

through the processing unit and are attached to the user as in Figure E.2 below.
    The set of sensors is distributed in three modules. The head module consists of a narrow-

beam sensor (represented as a dashed red line) mounted in the head of the user. The purpose
of this module is to provide the user with accurate information regarding an objects position,
size and distance.

    The second module is the array of six wide-beam sensors. The use of wide-beam sensors
enables the system to detect objects in a larger area. In order to give more detailed information
on an object's spatial location the sensors are arranged such that portions of their beams overlap
with each other. The sensor matrix is aligned to give a wider range in the vertical orientation
than the horizontal.

    The third module detects objects and steps up or down at the ground level. This module
consists of a wide-beam sensor and a narrow-beam sensor. The wide-beam sensor detects
objects and obstructions on the ground. The narrow-beam sensor detects uneven surfaces such
as steps and stairs. This sensor will be positioned as shown in Figure E.4 with an angle .
This angle is adjustable to fit user needs. On flat surfaces, the sensor will detect a distance x
+ z. When a step is encountered, the distance read by the sensor will be diminished to x. In
order to avoid "false" detection of steps due to the movement of the user's body while walking,
a digital filter is used.

    The second major component of the system consists of 2 motors located in the front area
of the user (see Figure E.5), and 12 vibrating motors configured in a 3x3 matrix on the back of
the user (see Figure E.6). The head unit motor allows the user to scan for objects by moving
their head; the motor will generate higher intensity for closer objects and lower intensity for
farther objects. The narrow-beam motor is used to provide feedback about an uneven surface

is mounted on the users back provides feedback according to objects detected in front of the
users. For example if an object is detected in the lower right corner, then the lower right motor
will vibrate. The matrix motors also vary their intensity according to the distance of objects

    The level 0 description of the Visual Aide describes the overall input, output, and behavior
expected of the device.

    The rationale for our level 0 design was to keep the system easy to control by a non-technical
user. Too many buttons would confuse the user. The system will take environmental data of
the surroundings (objects) as input and provide vibration feedback as output to the user. The
only control is an on/off switch with everything else automated. The object is to provide the
user with care-free operation.

    The level 1 diagram reveals what is inside the level 0 box shown in Figure E.7.
    There are four main components in this part of our system design: the IR sensor bank,
ultrasonic sensor bank, PIC18F452, and vibrating motor bank. Also, there are modules for
supplying power to the components such as a voltage regulator.
    The reason for breaking the design into these four main components is because each one
provides a separate and distinct functionality towards the overall operation of the system. The
IR Sensor Bank is responsible for detecting changes in elevation of the surface (steps, curbs,
ledges) and also to identify objects targeted by they user's head. The Ultrasonic Sensor Bank
is responsible for detecting objects directly in front of the user and also indicating the object's
general location. The PIC18F452 is the control unit of the entire system. It will read data from

the sensor banks, process the data, and provide feedback control via the vibrating motor bank.
Finally, the vibrating motor bank, which is mounted on the back of the user, provides sensorial
feedback to the user in the form of vibrations of varying intensity based on the proximity of
the object and relative to the location of the object.

    The first decision for the design was which method was best to detect objects. The following
table outlines some of the advantages and disadvantages of a few methods.

    Ultrasonic sensors were capable of detecting the area which we required (Range: 1" -
10', with area of detection growing wider as distance increases). Infrared sensors were chosen
because they have a relatively narrow beam which can be used to easily pinpoint the location

of an object and also to conduct precise measurements to changes in elevation.
    The main disadvantages to laser and radar technology were high costs and bulkiness. Also,

no group member is familiar with the technology and large amounts of time to learn would be
required. Laser technology is useful in detecting small objects at far distances, but we found
that the large range of the lasers was unnecessary and the price of this technology is too high.

    The next decision falls in the category of feedback to the user. The following table outlines
of the advantages and disadvantages of two methods.

    The two alternatives to choose from involving feedback to the user were either through
vibrations or audible sounds. After some interviews and extensive research of the visually-
impaired, we learned that audible feedback would interfere with their vital sense of hearing.
Most blind people are trained to enhance their hearing capability to navigate naturally as
they walk so they typically avoid using devices that produce audible feedback. We chose to
use the vibration method due to its quiet operation, although this method will likely require
some getting used to as people are not used to having things producing this type of sensorial
feedback on their body.

    Finally, we needed to choose a method to control the other 3 components of the design.
We chose the PIC18F452 because it provides subsystems that are very useful for our design
such as multiple timer modules, and an ADC subsystem. Also, our familiarity with this device
encouraged us to use it for our main control. The PIC also provides many I/O ports, plenty
of internal flash memory, and is an inexpensive device.

    3.2 High Level Software Description
    The development of the software system exhibits the same modularity as the hardware
design shown in Figure E.8. Figure E.9 shows the overall behavior of the system as a state

its functionality.

    4 Design Verification and Testing
    The design testing is presented in the order that the tests were performed, from unit to
acceptance tests.
    4.1 Unit Testing
    The performance of the IR sensor was critical to the success of the system as it would be
observing the floor and informing the user of any upcoming steps. We had to test the sensor
to see if it could distinguish the height bob of a walker from the drop off of a set of steps.
    The graph above shows the effects of using a digital low-pass filter on the readings from
an IR sensor mounted at stomach-level on a walking person. The person walked on an even
surface in a laboratory environment to gather the data samples. In comparison with the data
obtained from the cart, the raw data has more noise, yet the low-pass filter manages to stabilize
the value considerably.
    4.1.1 Integration Testing
    This integration test checks that individual ultrasonic sensors could trigger individual mo-
tors. This is critical to insuring that the system gives proper feedback to the user about their
environment.
    This testing was performed many times and helped us to determine the proper adjust-
ments/angles of the sensors. Performing these tests also gave us insight on what to set the
sensor thresholds at in the software.
    4.1.2 Acceptance Testing
    One of the main engineering requirements is The system will detect objects that are at least
1in wide and 2in high at a distance of at least 3 ft from the user and as far as 7 ft in an area 2
ft wide, and provide sensory feedback. Also, the system should detect street signs and posts. In
order to insure that this requirement was met, the following acceptance test was constructed.
    4.2 Requirements Verification
    Tests were constructed and run for each of the engineering requirements. These are enu-
merated in the following table.

    Overall, the project was completed successfully and all the critical requirements were met.
We had the chance to meet with a visually impaired student and have him test the system.
We were content with the satisfaction he demonstrated towards the system. Considering this
system is at the prototype level, we are happy with the level of functionality the system was
able to reach.

    It was a challenge, but we were able to have the ultrasonic sensors and IR sensors work
together without having to increase the complexity level of the system. This is important
because the functions of both sensors are critical; the ultrasonic sensors perform the bulk of
the detection work, and one of the IR sensors is used to detect steps.

    While the system works well, there are some possible improvements to note:

     Place the motors on the front in a more sensitive area
     Make the system adaptable (turn off motors after long periods of time)

     Design a better vest more suited for everyday use

     Use a faster crystal or microcontroller to improve refresh rate

     Replace the IR sensors with more reliable and consistent sensors

     Put the circuitry in a PCB to reduce space and weight

     Fine-tune object detection with the ultrasonic sensors

    The experience of working as a design team has taught us valuable lessons. We learned
the importance of communicating as a team, and understanding the abilities and limitations
of each member in order to maximize the team's performance. Also, we realized how much of
a difference a good planning can make; having a good design from the previous semester made
it a lot easier to jump into work at the beginning of the term.

    On a more technical level, we learned how much the use of analog and digital filters can
help in cleaning signal noise. This played a major role in having the system operate correctly.

    Finally, meeting with a blind person made us realize how important and useful it is to
obtain feedback from the expected users of the system.
