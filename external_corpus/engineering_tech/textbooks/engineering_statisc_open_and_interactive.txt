About this Book

Engineering Statics: Open and Interactive is a free, open-source textbook for
anyone who wishes to learn more about vectors, forces, moments, static equilib-
rium, and the properties of shapes. Specifically, it is appropriate as a textbook
for Engineering Mechanics: Statics, the first course in the Engineering Mechanics
series offered in most university-level engineering programs.

    This book's content should prepare you for subsequent classes covering En-
gineering Mechanics: Dynamics and Mechanics of Materials. At its core, Engi-
neering Statics provides the tools to solve static equilibrium problems for rigid
bodies. The additional topics of resolving internal loads in rigid bodies and
computing area moments of inertia are also included as stepping stones for later
courses. We have endeavored to write in an approachable style and provide many
questions, examples, and interactives for you to engage with and learn from.

Access. The entire book is available for free as an interactive online ebook
at https://engineeringstatics.org. While the interactive version works best on
larger screens, it will also work smartphones but with some limitations due to lim-
ited screen width. A non-interactive PDF version, suitable for printing or offline
reading on a tablet or computer, is available at https://engineeringstatics.org/
pdf/statics.pdf. The PDF is searchable and easy to navigate using embedded
links.

End of Chapter exercises. The randomized end-of-chapter exercises were
made using the Numbas open-source assessment system and Geogebra for the dy-
namic diagrams. Exercises in the EngineeringStaticsRepository can be freely
remixed into your own homework sets or online exams using the NumbasEditor.
You can also use the editor to write new questions or modify existing ones.

    The exercises can be integrated into your institution's Virtual Learning Envi-
ronment to set deadlines and automatically record grades. See the NumbasDocumentation
for more information. To fully take advantage of all the features, you may need
the support of your institution's IT department to install the NumbasLTIprovider.

    Please ask questions about Numbas integration and share any good problems
you write with the Engineering Statics Group.

This book is the vision of a handful of instructors who wanted to create a free
and open Engineering Statics textbook filled with dynamic, interactive diagrams
to encourage visualization and engineering intuition.

    Dr. Baker brought together a team of volunteers from large public universi-
ties, small private colleges, and community colleges across the United States to
write the text and create the interactive elements. Some content was adapted
with permission from Jacob Moore's Mechanics Map - Open Textbook Project.
http://mechanicsmap.psu.edu/. After two years of development the book was
released to the public in 2020.

    The book continues to evolve thanks to the contributions, suggestions, and
corrections made by users of the text, both professors and students. The original

Introduction to Statics

Engineering Statics is the gateway into engineering mechanics, which is the ap-
plication of Newtonian physics to design and analyze objects, systems, and struc-
tures with respect to motion, deformation, and failure. In addition to learning
the subject itself, you will also develop skills in the art and practice of problem
solving and mathematical modeling, skills that will benefit you throughout your
engineering career.

    The subject is called "statics" because it is concerned with particles and rigid
bodies that are in equilibrium, and these will usually be stationary, i.e. static.

    The chapters in this book are:

       Introduction to Statics-- an overview of statics and an introduction to
       units and problem solving.

       Forces and Other Vectors-- basic principles and mathematical operations
       on force and position vectors.

       Equilibrium of Particles-- an introduction to equilibrium and problem
       solving.

       Moments and Static Equivalence-- the rotational tendency of forces, and
       simplification of force systems.

       Rigid Body Equilibrium-- balance of forces and moments for single rigid
       bodies.

       Equilibrium of Structures-- balance of forces and moments on intercon-
       nected systems of rigid bodies.

       Centroids and Centers of Gravity-- an important geometric property of
       shapes and rigid bodies.

       Internal Forces-- forces and moments within beams and other rigid bodies.

       Friction-- equilibrium of bodies subject to friction.

Moments of Inertia-- an important property of geometric shapes used in
many applications.

    Your statics course may not cover all of these topics, or may move through
them in a different order.

    Below are two examples of the types of problems you'll learn to solve in
statics. Notice that each can be described with a picture and problem statement,
a free-body diagram, and equations of equilibrium.

    Equilibrium of a particle: A 140 lb person walks across a slackline
stretched between two trees. If angles  and  are known, find the tension
in each end of the slackline.

   y                                Person's point of con-

                                    tact to slackline:

                                                      Fx = 0
                                    x -T1 cos  + T2 cos  = 0

                                              Fy = 0
                                    T1 sin  + T2 sin  - W = 0

    Equilibrium of a rigid body: Given the interaction forces at point C on
the upper arm of the excavator, find the internal axial force, shear force, and
bending moment at point D.

      D                             -Cx + Fx - Vx - Nx = 0

                                                                                 Fy = 0
                                                                       -Cy - Fy - Vy + Ny = 0

                                                                      F

                                                                                MD = 0
                                                                       +(dy)Cx + (dx)Cy - MD = 0

    The knowledge and skills gained in Statics will be used in your other en-
gineering courses, in particular in Dynamics, Mechanics of Solids (also called
Strength or Mechanics of Materials), and in Fluid Mechanics. Statics will be a
foundation of your engineering career.

1.1 Newton's Laws of Motion

    Key Questions

       · What are the two types of motion?

       · What three relationships do Newton's laws of motion define?

       · What are physical examples for each of Newton's three laws of mo-
           tion?

    The English scientist Sir Isaac Newton laid the foundation of mechanics in
1687 with his three laws of motion, which describe the relationship between
forces, objects, and motion. Motion can be categorized into two types:

       Translation-- where a body changes position without changing its orien-
       tation in space, and

       Rotation-- where a body spins about an axis fixed in space, without
       changing its average position.

    Some moving bodies purely translate, others purely rotate, and many do
both. Conveniently, we can separate translation and rotation and analyze them
individually using independent equations.

    Newton's three laws and their implications for to translation and rotation
are described below.
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS          4

1.1.1 Newton's 1st Law

Newton's first law states that

       an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line
       unless acted upon by an external force.

This law, also sometimes called the "law of inertia," tells us that bodies maintain
their current velocity unless a net force is applied to change it. In other words, an
object at rest it will remain at rest and a moving object will hold its current speed
and direction unless an unbalanced force causes a velocity change. Remember
that velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction, so
an unbalanced force may cause an object to speed up, slow down, or change
direction.

(like a crane or another ice age) causes    tional attraction continuously changes
it to move.                                 its velocity.

    Newton's first law also applies to angular velocities, however instead of force,
the relevant quantity which causes an object to rotate is called a torque by
physicists, but usually called a moment by engineers. A moment, as you will
learn in Chapter 4, is the rotational tendency of a force. Just as a force will cause
a change in linear velocity, a moment will cause a change in angular velocity. This
can be seen in things like tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects that
spin on an axis when a moment is applied, but eventually stop because of the
opposite moment produced by friction.

                                        In the absence of friction this top
                                    would spin forever, but the small fric-
                                    tional moment exerted at the point of
                                    contact with the table will eventually
                                    bring it to a stop.

Figure 1.1.3 A spinning top demon-
strates rotary motion.

1.1.2 Newton's 2nd Law

Newton's second law is usually succinctly stated with the familiar equation

F = ma                              (1.1.1)

where F is net force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.
    You will notice that the force and the acceleration are in bold face. This

means these are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction.
Mass on the other hand is a scalar quantity, which has only a magnitude. This
equation indicates that a force will cause an object to accelerate in the direction
of the net force, and the magnitude of the acceleration will be proportional to
the net force but inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

    When studying Statics we are only concerned with bodies which are not accel-
erating which simplifies things considerably. When an object is not accelerating
a = 0, which implies that it is either at rest or moving with a constant velocity.
With this restriction Newton's Second Law for translation simplifies to

F = 0                               (1.1.2)

where F is read as "the sum of the forces" and used to indicate the net force
acting on the object.

    Newton's second law for rotational motions is similar

M = I.                              (1.1.3)

This equation states that a net moment M acting on an object will cause an angu-
lar acceleration  proportional to the net moment and inversely proportional to
I, a quantity known as the mass moment of inertia. Mass moment of inertia
for rotational acceleration is analogous to ordinary mass for linear acceleration.
We will have more to say about the moment of inertia in Chapter 10.

    Again, we see that the net moment and angular acceleration are vectors,
quantities with magnitude and direction. The mass moment of inertia, on the
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS  6

other hand, is a scalar quantity and has only a magnitude. Also, since Statics
deals only with objects which are not accelerating  = 0, they will always be at
rest or rotating with constant angular velocity. With this restriction Newton's
second law implies that the net moment on all static objects is zero.

M = 0                               (1.1.4)

1.1.3 Newton's 3rd Law

Newton's Third Law states

       For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

The actions and reactions Newton is referring to are forces. Forces occur when-
ever one object interacts with another, either directly like a push or pull, or
indirectly like magnetic or gravitational attraction. Any force acting on one
body is always paired with another equal-and-opposite force acting on some
other body.

Figure 1.1.4 The earth exerts a gravitational force on the moon, and the moon
exerts an equal and opposite force on the earth.

    These equal-and-opposite pairs can be confusing, particularly when there are
multiple interacting bodies. To clarify, we always begin solving statics problems
by drawing a free-body diagram-- a sketch where we isolate a body or system
of interest and identify the forces acting on it, while ignoring any forces exerted
by it on interacting bodies.

    Consider the situation in Figure 1.1.5. Diagram (a) shows a book resting on
a table supported by the floor. The weights of the book and table are placed at
their centers of gravity. To solve for the forces on the legs of the table, we use the
free-body diagram in (b) which treats the book and the table as a single system
and replaces the floor with the forces of the floor on the table. In diagram (c)
the book and table are treated as independent objects. By separating them, the
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS                7

equal-and-opposite interaction forces of the book on the table and the table on
the book are exposed.

1.2 Units

    Key Questions

       · What are the similarities and differences between the SI, British
           Gravitational, and English Engineering unit systems?

       · How do you convert a value into different units?

       · When a Statics problem give a value in pounds, is this referring to
           pounds-force or pounds-mass?

    Engineering quantities consist of a numeric value and an associated unit (like
150 kg, 9.81 m/s2, or 17 ft). The values by themselves (150, 9.81, or 17) are just
numbers, but the units give the numbers context. When discussing a quantity,
you must always include the associated unit. The exceptions to this rule are
unitless quantities, which are typically ratios where the units all cancel out.

    Related units are defined as a coherent unit system. All unit systems are
based on seven base units, the important ones for Statics being mass, length,
and time. These base units combine to form all other measurement units. For
example:

   · Acceleration is defined as length [L] divided by time [t] squared, so has
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS          8

   units a = [L/t2]

· Force is the product of mass and acceleration, as defined by Newton's
   second law, so the units of force are F = [mL/t2].

1.2.1 Unit Systems

Multiple unit systems are generally used in engineering practice in the United
States, including the SI and British Gravitational systems. A third, the English
Engineering system, is commonly only used in Physics applications.

    The SI system, abbreviated from the French Système International (d'unités)
is the modern form of the metric system. The SI system is used for most in-
ternational engineering and increasingly used in the U.S. in fields like science,
medicine, electronics, and the military.

    In the SI system, the unit of force is the newton, abbreviated N , and the
unit of mass is the kilogram, abbreviated kg. The base unit of time, used by
all systems, is the second, abbreviated s. Prefixes are added to unit names are
used to specify the base-10 multiple of the original unit. One newton is equal
to 1 kg · m/s2 because 1 N of force applied to 1 kg of mass causes the mass to
accelerate at a rate of 1 m/s2.

    The other unit systems, British Gravitational and English Engineering, fall
under the general name of "Imperial units," given their broad use in the British
Empire. The British Gravitational system uses the foot, abbreviated ft, as the
base unit of distance, the second for time, and the slug for mass. Force is
expressed in the unit of pound-force, abbreviated lbf, or lb for short. One
pound-force will accelerate a mass of one slug at 1 ft/s2, so 1 lbf = 1 slug · ft/s2.
On earth, a 1 slug mass weighs 32.174 lbf.

    The English Engineering system also uses foot as the base unit of distance
and second for time, but, unlike the British Gravitational system, uses pound-
mass as the base unit of mass, where

32.174 lbm = 1 slug = 14.6 kg.

    While gravitational acceleration remains the same between the British Grav-
itational and English Engineering systems, a conversion factor is required to
maintain unit consistency.

                    1 lbf · s2      1 slug  (1.2.1)
1 = 32.174 ft · lbm = 32.174 lbm

    The perceived advantage of the English Engineering system is that on Earth,
a mass of 1 lbm weighs 1 lbf. However, this numerical equivalence often causes
confusion, given the required gravitational conversion factor mentioned in the
previous paragraph and the simple fact that mass and weight are different. Mass
describes how much matter an object contains, while weight is a force -- the
effect of gravity on a mass.
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS                                             9

    Therefore, the U.S. engineering community primarily embraces the British
Gravitational system but avoids the mass unit of slugs, instead stating material
amounts as weight in pounds-force, or for brevity, pounds.

    Table 1.2.1 shows the standard units of weight, mass, length, time, and
gravitational acceleration in three unit systems.

Thinking Deeper 1.2.2 Pounds Mass vs. Pounds Force.

The confusion caused by U.S. engineering students learning about the
pounds-mass + pounds-force system in Physics, closely followed by adopt-
ing a slugs + pounds-force system in Statics, often leads students to ask "Is
this pound a mass or force?" to which Statics faculty commonly respond
"All pounds are forces in Statics."
Below you'll find an online song and the lyrics that Dan Baker created to
help students remember that all pounds in Statics are pounds-force.
Here's the link to the Song "Pounds are a Force" at Suno.com.

                         Pounds are a Force

Our world is engineering, let's get it right,
Pounds are a force, not mass in our sight.
We measure with care, we never confuse,
Pounds-mass is a unit that we never use.

[chorus]
Pounds are force, feel their weight,
That is what Engineers calculate.
SI uses Kilograms for mass, Newtons for force,
But in the U.S. we are different of course.

Gravity pulls, and we feel the strain,
Newtons and pounds, they make it plain.
Kilograms and slugs, they are the masses,
The amount of material across our classes.

[chorus]
Pounds are force, feel their weight,
That is what Engineers calculate.
SI uses Kilograms for mass, Newtons for force,
But in the U.S. we are different of course.

From meters to feet, we can convert,
9.81 meters is simply 32.2 feet, that's certain.
So don't ask: do we multiply or divide?
Just write W = mg, and then decide.

[chorus]
Pounds are force, feel their weight,
That is what Engineers calculate.
SI uses Kilograms for mass, Newtons for force,
But in the U.S. we are different of course.

So when you measure, know your course,
In engineering, pounds are force.
Leave pounds mass back in the dust,
In the US Customary System we trust.

1.2.2 Units within Newton's 2nd Law

Given that Newton's 2nd Law, F = ma, is one of the foundational equations
in engineering mechanics and the most basic equation relating mass and weight,
let's examine its use in more detail. First we need to relate F = ma to weight,
mass, and gravity. Consider an object in free fall. The only vertical force on
the body is its weight W ; thus, the object's mass m is accelerated by gravity g.
Therefore, we can tranform Newton's 2nd Law F = ma to W = mg.

    The scalar version, W = mg, also serves as the conversion equation among
weight, mass, and gravity. You likely know this relationship for problems using
the SI system. Hence, if you are given a 100 kg object here on earth and are
asked to find the weight, you compute:

                                   W = mg
                                   W = 100 kg (9.81 m/s2)
                                   W = 981 N

    The confusion often starts when students in the United States are asked to
find the mass of a known-weight object. Let's say you are asked to find the
mass of a 100 lb object. Given the U.S. engineering convention that all pounds
are force, the lb unit listed in the problem is pounds-force. Here's the root of
the confusion: SI problems give an object's mass, while U.S. problems
give an object's weight. Life would be easier if this was not the case, but
never fear -- we can use W = mg to solve the problem. This time we will solve
for m instead of W .

                                          W = mg
                                     100 lb = m 32.2 ft/s2

                                                    100 lb
                                           m = 32.2 ft/s2
                                           m = 3.1 slug

    Next we will investigate the values of the gravitational acceleration constant
in SI and the British Gravitational system. As both measure the acceleration of
an object toward the Earth, it should make sense that they are equivalent:

                           g = 9.81 m/s2 3.28 ft  32.2 ft/s2
                                                  1m

As shown in this unit conversion, always make sure to multiply terms by the cor-
rect ratios to get your desired units. In this case we multipled by (3.28 ft/1 m)
with meters in the bottom so it cancels out with the meters in the top of
9.81 m/s2.

    Here are two examples to test your understanding of the relationships among
weight, mass, and gravity.
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS                                  12

Example 1.2.3

How much does a 5 kg bag of flour weigh on Earth?
Hint. A value in kg is a mass. Weight is a force.
Solution.

                                 W = mg
                                     = 5 kg(9.81 m/s2)
                                     = 49.05 N

Example 1.2.4

How much does a 5 lb bag of sugar weigh?
Hint. When a problem says pounds, it is referring to pounds-force.
Solution. The weight was given:

    W = 5 lb = 5 lbf.

If you needed the mass in slugs, the mass is

m=  5 lbf      2 = 0.155 slug.

    32.2 ft/s

1.2.3 Avoiding Common Unit Errors

Awareness of units will help you prevent errors in your engineering calculations.
You should always:

   · Pay attention to the units of every quantity in the problem. Forces should
       have force units, distances should have distance units, etc.

   · Use the unit system given in the problem statement and ensure any con-
       stants used agree with the units of the other terms. For example, g =
       9.81 m/s2 should only be used when the rest of the problem is in SI units,
       matching the units of m and s.

   · Avoid unit conversions when possible. If you must, convert given values to
       a consistent set of units and stick with them.

   · Ensure unit consistency in your calculations. You can only add or subtract
       quantities with the same units. When multiplying or dividing quantities
       with units, apply the same operation to the units. Finally, the units on
       both sides of an equation must match.
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS  13

   · Develop a sense of the magnitudes of the units and consider your answers
       for reasonableness. On Earth, the four commonly used masses and weights,
       from smallest to largest, are roughly equivalent to:

              Newton = 1 apple,

              pound-force = box of butter,

              kilogram = a pineapple, and

              slug = a medium dog (like a Corgi).

   · Assume every answer in Statics, and engineering in general, has units. A
       few answers will be dimensionless, but not many.

    Understanding the relationship between weight, mass, and gravitational ac-
celeration is essential for solving Statics problems. Always identify whether
weight or mass is given and use W = mg with the correct gravitational accelera-
tion. This intentional process will help you confidently work across both SI and
U.S. unit systems.

1.3 Forces

    Key Questions

       · What are some of the fundamental types of forces used in statics?

       · Why do we often simplify distributed forces with equivalent point
           forces?

    A force is simply a linear push or pull, yet forces come from a variety of
sources and occur in many different situations. As such we need a specialized
vocabulary to talk about them. We are also interested in forces that cause
rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.

    Some terms used to describe forces are given below; others will be defined as
needed later in the book.

    Point Forces, also called concentrated forces, are forces that act at a
single point. Examples are the push you give to open a door, the thrust of a
rocket engine, or the pull a the chain suspending a wrecking ball. Point forces
are actually an idealization, because real forces always act over an area and not
at a mathematical point. However, point forces are the easiest type to deal with
computationally so we will usually represent other types of forces as equivalent
concentrated forces.

    Distributed forces are forces that are spread out over a line, area or volume.
Water pressure on the side of a swimming pool and the weight of snow on a
roof are examples of forces distributed over an area. Distributed forces are
represented graphically by an array of force vectors.
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS  14

    Body forces are distributed forces acting over the volume of a body. The
most common body force is the body's weight, but there are others including
buoyancy and forces caused by electric and magnetic fields. Weight and buoyancy
will be the only body forces we consider in this book.

    In many situations, body forces are small in comparison to the other forces
acting on the object, and as such may be neglected. In practice, the decision
to neglect forces must be made on the basis of sound engineering judgment;
however, in this course you should consider the weight in your analysis if the
problem statement provides enough information to determine it, otherwise you
may ignore it.

    Loads are the forces which an object must support in order to perform its
function. Loads can be either static or dynamic, however only static loads will
be considered here. Forces which hold a loaded object in equilibrium or hold
parts of an object together are not considered loads.

    Reaction forces or simply reactions are the forces and moments which
hold or constrain an object or mechanical system in equilibrium. They are
called the reactions because they react when other forces on the system change.
If the load on a system increases, the reaction forces will automatically increase
in response to maintain equilibrium. Reaction forces are introduced in Chapter 3
and reaction moments are introduced in Chapter 5.

    Interaction forces are forces that exist between rigid bodies. They are
defined by Newton's 3nd Law as being equal and opposite. Interaction forces
become important in Chapter 6 when working with multi-body structures.

    Internal forces are forces and moments that exist within the material of a
rigid body that resist the external loads to keep the rigid body from breaking.
We model these internal loads as an axial force, a shear force, and a bending
moment. Internal forces will be discussed in Chapter 8.

    The figure below illustrates multiple of these force types using a heavy crate
being pulled by a rope across a rough surface.
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS                                      15

(a) Pull - Concentrated force     (b) Weight - Body force

(c) Friction - Distributed force  (d) Normal Force - Distributed force

Figure 1.3.1 Forces on a crate being pulled across a rough surface.

    The pull of the rope and the weight of the crate are loads. The rope applies
a force at a single point, so is a concentrated force. The force of the ground
holding the crate in equilibrium is a reaction force. This force can be divided
into two components: a tangential friction component which acts parallel to
the ground and resists the pull of the cable, and a normal component which
acts perpendicular to the bottom surface and supports the crate's weight. The
normal and tangential components are distributed forces since they act over the
bottom surface area. The weight is also a distributed force, but one that acts
over the entire crate so it's considered a body force. For computational simplicity
we usually model all these distributed forces as equivalent concentrated forces.
This process is discussed in Chapter 7.

1.4 Problem Solving

    Key Questions

       · What are some strategies to practice selecting a tool from your
           problem-solving toolbox?

       · What is the basic problem-solving process for equilibrium?

    Statics may be the first course you take where you are required to decide on
your own how to approach a problem. Unlike your previous Physics courses, you
can't just memorize a formula and plug-and-chug to get an answer; there are
often multiple ways to solve a problem, not all of them equally easy, so before
you begin you need a plan or strategy. This seems to cause a lot of students
difficulty.
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS  16

    The ways to think about forces, moments and equilibrium, and the mathe-
matics used to manipulate them are like tools in your toolbox. Solving statics
problems requires acquiring, choosing, and using these tools. Some problems can
be solved with a single tool, while others require multiple tools. Sometimes one
tool is a better choice, sometimes another. You need familiarity and practice to
get skilled using your tools. As your skills and understanding improve, it gets
easier to recognize the most efficient way to get a job done.

    Struggling statics students often say things like:

       "I don't know where to start the problem."

       "It looks so easy when you do it."

       "If I only knew which equation to apply, I could solve the problem."

These statements indicate that the students think they know how to use their
tools, but are skipping the planning step. They jump right to writing equations
and solving for things without making much progress towards the answer, or
they start solving the problem using a reasonable approach but abandon it in
mid-stream to try something else. They get lost, confused and give up.

    Choosing a strategy gets easier with experience. Unfortunately, the way you
get that experience is to solve problems. If you think that this is a chicken and
egg problem, you are correct. Here are some suggestions which will help you
become a better problem-solver.

   · Hone your math skills, in the areas of algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.
       These are complimentary tools to solve engineering problems, but only
       help after you get the problem set up.

   · Build your understanding of the terminology. If you do not understand
       the words in the problem statement, then you will have difficulty setting
       up your equations to solve the problem.

   · Every engineering equation comes with assumptions. Learn these assump-
       tions so you can decide whether a specific equation is valid within the
       context of a problem.

   · Work through, or at least set up, lots of problems. Start with simple ones
       to build your skills.

   · Start by viewing examples or videos, but progress to working problems on
       your own. Seeing someone else's solution will make you overconfident that
       you can do the same thing. The only way you'll know is to try on your
       own.

   · Solve problems using multiple approaches. Confirm that alternate ap-
       proaches produce the same results and try to understand why one method
       was easier than the other.
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STATICS  17

   · Draw neat, clear, labeled diagrams.

   · When you get frustrated, you have just found something new to learn.
       Don't get stuck for more than 15-20 minutes. Work to identify what is
       confusing you and find informative resources or ask questions.

    The majority of the topics in this book focus on equilibrium. The remaining
topics are either preparing you for solving equilibrium problems or setting you
up with skills that you will use in later classes. For equilibrium problems, the
problem-solving steps are:

   1. Read and understand the problem.

   2. Identify what you are asked to find and what is given.

   3. Stop, think, and decide on an strategy.

   4. Draw a free-body diagram with all the required elements:

         (a) An isolated body or group of bodies
        (b) All applied loads
         (c) All reactions from supports
        (d) An axis system
         (e) Labeled vectors

   5. Write equations of equilibrium based on the free-body diagram.

   6. Check if the number of equations equals the number of unknowns. If it
       doesn't, you are missing something. You may need additional free-body
       diagrams or other relationships.

   7. Solve for unknowns, then evaluate the reasonableness of your answer(s)
       magnitude, units, and sign/direction.

    Using these steps does not guarantee that you will get the right solution, but
it will help you be critical and conscious of your chosen strategies. This reflection
will help you learn more quickly and increase the odds that you choose the right
tool for the job.
Chapter 2

Forces and Other Vectors

To progress to the later topics of static equilibrium, structures, and friction, you
will need to first build a robust set of basic vector analysis skills. These skills
include:

   · Understanding the basic terminology around vectors.
   · Computing vector components from the various ways that vector magni-

       tude and direction can be defined.
   · Extracting vector direction in the form of a unit vector.
   · Adding and subtracting vectors.
   · Finding the parallel projections of vectors with dot projects.
   · Computing cross products to find the rotational tendency of forces.
    This chapter will help you build this skillset. You may notice that many of
the tools in this chapter are also covered in your Calculus III course. Use this
overlap to your advantage to dial in your computational skills in calculus, while
learning about the application of the math tools here in statics.

2.1 Vectors

    Key Questions
       · What differentiates a vector from a scalar?
       · What are the standard notations for vectors and scalars in this text-
           book?
       · How do you identify the tip, tail, line of action, direction, and mag-
           nitude of a vector?

                                                  18
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  19

       · What is the difference between the sense and orientation of a vector?

    Before you can solve statics problems, you will need to understand the basic
physical quantities used in Statics: scalars and vectors.

    Scalars are physical quantities that have no associated direction and can
be described by a positive or negative number, or even zero. Scalar quantities
follow the usual laws of algebra, and most scalar quantities have units. Mass,
time, temperature, and length are all scalars.

    Vectors represent physical quantities that have magnitude and direction.
Vectors are identified by a symbolic name which will be typeset in bold like r or
F to indicate its vector nature. The primary vector quantity you will encounter
in statics will be force, but moment and position are also important vectors.
Computations involving vectors must always consider the directionality of each
term and follow the rules of vector algebra as described in this chapter.

    You can visualize a vector as an arrow pointing in a particular direction.
The tip is the pointed end and the tail the trailing end. The tip and tail of a
vector define a line of action. A line of action can be thought of as an invisible
string along which a vector can slide. Sliding a vector along its line of action
does not change its magnitude or its direction. Sliding a vector can be a handy
way to simplify vector problems.

Figure 2.1.1 Vector Definitions
    The standard notation for a vector uses the vector's name in bold font, or

an arrow or bar above the vector's name. All three of these notations mean the
same thing.

                              F = F = F¯ = a vector named F

Most printed works including this book will use the bold symbol to indicate
vectors, but for handwritten work, you and your instructor will use the bar or
arrow notation.

    Force vectors acting on physical objects have a point of application, which
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  20

is the point where the force is applied. Other vectors, such as moment vectors,
are free vectors, which means that the point of application is not significant.
Free vectors can be moved freely to any location as long as the magnitude and
direction are maintained.

    The vector's magnitude is a positive real number including units which
describes the `strength' or `intensity' of the vector. Graphically a vector's mag-
nitude is represented by the length of its vector arrow, and symbolically by
enclosing the vector's symbol with vertical bars. This is the same notation as
for the absolute value of a number. The absolute value of a number and the
magnitude of a vector can both be thought of as a distance from the origin, so
the notation is appropriate. By convention the magnitude of a vector is also
indicated by the same letter as the vector, but in non-bold font.

                           F = |F| = the magnitude of vector F

    By itself, a vector's magnitude is a scalar quantity, but it makes no sense to
speak of a vector with a negative magnitude so vector magnitudes are always
positive or zero. Multiplying a vector by -1 produces a vector with the same
magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction.

    Vector directions are described with respect to a coordinate system. A
coordinate system is an arbitrary reference system used to establish the origin
and the primary directions. Distances are usually measured from the origin, and
directions from a primary or reference direction. You are probably familiar
with the Cartesian coordinate system with mutually perpendicular x, y and z
axes and the origin at their intersection point.

    Another way of describing a vector's direction is to specify its orientation
and sense. Orientation is the angle the vector's line of action makes with a
specified reference direction, and sense defines the direction the vector points
along its line of action. A vector with a positive sense points towards the positive
end of the reference axis and vice-versa. A vector representing an object's weight
has a vertical reference direction and a downward sense or negative sense, for
example.

    A third way to represent a vector is with a unit vector multiplied by a
scalar component. Unit vectors (which we'll learn about in Section 2.5) are
vectors with a magnitude of one (unitless), and scalar components are signed
values with units. Together, they fully define a vector quantity; the unit vector
specifies the direction of its line of action, and the scalar component specifies its
magnitude and sense. The scalar component "scales" the unit vector.

    Be careful not to confuse scalar components, which can be positive or nega-
tive, with vector magnitudes, which are always positive.

    Vectors are either constant or vary as a function of time, position, or some-
thing else. For example, if a force varies with time according to the function
F (t) = (10 N/s)t, where t is the time in seconds, then the force will be 0 N at
t = 0 s and increase by 10 N each second thereafter.

2.2 One-Dimensional Vectors

Key Questions
   · Why is one-dimensional vector math just like scalar math?

   · Given two one-dimensional vectors, how do you compute and then
       draw the resultant?

   · What happens when you multiply a vector by a scalar?

    The simplest vector calculations involve one-dimensional vectors. With one-
dimensional vectors, vector arithmetic is the same as ordinary arithmetic.

    By definition, one-dimensional vectors all act along a single line. The line
they share is called the line of action, but note that vectors that act along a
line may point towards either end.

    If we place a coordinate axis along the line of action and give vectors that
point towards the positive end positive values equal to their magnitudes, and give
vectors that point the other way negative values, then the vectors add, subtract
and multiply by constants just like ordinary numbers along the number line. The
resulting sign indicates the direction of the result. Note that, by convention, the
labeled end of an axis is the positive end.

2.2.1 Vector Addition

Adding multiple vectors together finds the resultant vector. Resultant vectors
can be thought of as the sum of or combination of two or more vectors.

    To find the resultant vector R of two one-dimensional vectors A and B you
can use the tip-to-tail technique in Figure 2.1.1 below. In the tip-to-tail tech-
nique, you slide vector B until its tail is at the tip of A, and the vector from
the tail of A to the tip of B is the resultant R. Note that vector addition is
commutative: the resultant R is the same whether you add A to B or B to A.

CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                           22

2.2.2 Vector Subtraction

The easiest way to handle vector subtraction is to add the negative of the vector
you are subtracting to the other vector. In this way, you can still use the tip-to-
tail technique after flipping the vector you are subtracting.

A - B = A + (-B)                     (2.2.1)

Example 2.2.2 Vector subtraction.

Find A - B where A = 2 i and B = 3 i.
Solution. You can simulate this in Figure 2.2.1.

   1. Set A to a value of 2 i and B to a value of -3 i, the negative of its
       actual value.

   2. Move the vectors until they are tip-to-tail. The order does not matter
       because vector addition is commutative.

R = -1 i.

2.2.3 Vector Multiplication by a Scalar

Multiplying or dividing a vector by a scalar changes the vector's magnitude but
maintains its original line of action. In other words, multiplying a vector by a
scalar "scales" the vector.

    One common transformation is to find the negative of a vector. To find the
negative of vector A, we multiply it by -1; in equation form

                                          -A = (-1)A

    Spatially, the effect of multiplying a vector by -1, is to reverse it end for
end. The magnitude and line of action stay the same, but the sense reverses, so
now the arrowhead points in the opposite direction. When multiplying vector
components by -1, simply flip the +/- sign of each term to flip the direction of
the vector.

2.3 2D Coordinate Systems & Vectors

   Key Questions

       · Why are orthogonal coordinate systems useful?

       · How do you transform between polar and Cartesian coordinates?
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  23

        · How is the notation for point coordinates different than that of vector
           coordinates?

    A coordinate system provides a reference frame to describe a system we want
to analyze. Although there are many different coordinate systems that can be
used, selecting an appropriate one will make a problem easier to solve.

    In statics, we use orthogonal coordinate systems, where orthogonal means
"perpendicular." The advantage of orthogonal coordinate systems is that the
coordinate directions are all perpendicular and, therefore, independent. The
intersection of the coordinate axes is called the origin, and measurements are
made from there. Both points and vectors are described with a set of numbers
called the coordinates. For points in space, the coordinates specify the distance
you must travel in each of the coordinate directions to get from the origin to the
point in question. Together, the coordinates can be thought of as specifying a
position vector, a vector from the origin directly to the point. The position
vector gives the magnitude and direction needed to travel directly from the origin
to the point.

    In the case of force vectors, the coordinates are the scalar components of
the force in each of the coordinate directions. These components locate the tip
of the vector and they can be interpreted as the fraction of the total force which
acts in each of the coordinate directions.

    Three coordinate directions are needed to map our real three-dimensional
world but in this section we will start with two, simpler, two-dimensional or-
thogonal systems: rectangular and polar coordinates, and the tools to convert
from one to the other.

2.3.1 Rectangular Coordinates

The most important coordinate system is the Cartesian system, which was
named after the French mathematician René Descartes. In two dimensions the
coordinate axes are straight lines rotated 90° apart named x, and y.

    In most cases, the x axis is horizontal and points to the right, and the y
axis points vertically upward, however, we are free to rotate or translate this
entire coordinate system if we like. It is usually mathematically advantageous
to establish the origin at a convenient point to make measurements from, and
to align one of the coordinate axes with a major feature of the problem.

    Points are specified as an ordered pair of coordinate values separated by a
comma and enclosed in parentheses, P = (x, y).
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  24

                Live Link

Figure 2.3.1 Cartesian Coordinate System
    Similarly, forces and other vectors will be specified with an ordered pair of

scalar components enclosed by angle brackets,

                                           F = Fx, Fy.

2.3.2 Polar Coordinates

The polar coordinate system is an alternate orthogonal system which is useful
in some situations. In this system, a point is specified by its distance r from the
origin, and an angle  measured counter-clockwise from a reference direction -
usually the positive x axis. Polar coordinates are useful if we know more about
distances and angles from a central point. Examples of systems that would
use polar coordinates would be tower cranes to build skyscrapers, robotic arm
motion, and radar systems.

    In this text, points in polar coordinates will be specified as an ordered pair
of values separated by a semicolon and enclosed in parentheses

                                            P = (r; ).

    Angles can be measured in either radians or degrees, so be sure to include a
degree sign on angle  if that is what you intend.

2.3.3 Coordinate Transformation

You should be able to translate points from one coordinate system to the other
whenever necessary. The relation between (x, y) coordinates and (r; ) coordi-
nates are illustrated in the diagram and right-triangle trigonometry is all that is
needed to convert from one representation to the other.

    Luckily, it is quite easy to translate points between the rectangular (x, y) and
polar (r; ) coordinate systems using right-triangle trigonometry. As you move
point P around the figure below, you can see how the two coordinate types are
related.

Example 2.3.5 Rectangular to Polar Representation.

Express point P = (-8.66, 5) in polar coordinates.

Solution 1. Given: x = -8.66, y = 5

r = x2 + y2                           = tan-1 y
  = (-8.66)2 + (5)2                                 x
  = 10
                                       = tan-1 5
                                                    -8.66

                                       = tan-1(-0.577)
                                       = -30

You must be careful here and use some common sense. The -30 angle
your calculator gives you in this problem is incorrect because point P is
in the second quadrant, but your calculator doesn't know this. It can't
tell whether the argument of tan-1(-0.577) is negative because the x was
negative or because the y was negative, so it must make an assumption
and in this case it is wrong.
The arctan function on calculators will always return values in the first
and fourth quadrant. If, by inspection of the x and the y coordinates, you
see that the point is in the second or third quadrant, you must add or
subtract 180 to the calculator's answer.
So in this problem,  is really -30 + 180. After making this adjustment,
the location of P in polar coordinates is:
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                         28

                                      P = (10; 150)

Solution 2. Most scientific calculators include handy polar-to-
rectangular and rectangular-to-polar functions that can save you time and
help you avoid errors. Perhaps you should google your calculator model
to find out if yours does and learn how to use it?

Example 2.3.6 Polar to Rectangular Representation.
Express 200 N force F as a pair of scalar components.

Solution 1. Given: The magnitude of force F = 200 N, and from the
diagram we see that the direction of F is 30 counter-clockwise from the
negative x axis.
Letting  = 30 we can find the components of F with right triangle
trigonometry.

Fx = F cos          Fy = F sin 
    = 200 N cos 30      = 200 N sin 30
    = 173.2 N           = 100 N

Since the force points down and to the left into the third quadrant, these
values are actually negative, and the signs must be applied manually.
After making this adjustment, the location of F expressed in rectangular
coordinates is:

                               F = -173.2 N, -100 N

Solution 2. If you would prefer not to apply the negative signs by hand,
you can convert the 30 to an angle measured from the positive x axis
and let your calculator takes care of the signs. You may use either  =
30 ± 180.
For  = -150
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                        29

Fx = F cos             Fy = F sin 
    = 200 N cos(-150)      = 200 N sin(-150)
    = -173.2 N             = -100 N

            F = -173.2 N, -100 N

Although this approach is mathematically correct, experience has shown
that it can lead to errors and we recommend that when you work with
right triangles, use angles between zero and 90, and apply signs manually
as required by the physical situation.

2.4 3D Coordinate Systems & Vectors

    Key Questions

       · How can we check if a rectangular coordinate system follows the
           right-hand rule?

       · What are direction cosine angles and why are they always less than
           180°?

       · How are spherical coordinates different than cylindrical coordinates?

    In this section we will discuss four methods to specify points and vectors in
three-dimensional space.

    The most commonly used method is an extension of two-dimensional rec-
tangular coordinates to three-dimensions. Alternately, points and vectors
in three dimensions can be specified in terms of direction cosines, or using
spherical or cylindrical coordinate systems. These will be discussed in the
following sections.

    You will often need to convert from one representation to another. Good
visualization skills are helpful here.

2.4.1 Rectangular Coordinates

We can extend the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system into three di-
mensions easily by adding a z axis perpendicular to the two-dimensional Carte-
sian plane. The notation is similar to the notation used for two-dimensional
vectors. Points and forces are expressed as ordered triples of rectangular coordi-
nates following the same notation used previously.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                     30

P = (x, y, z)  F = Fx, Fy, Fz

    For nearly all three-dimensional problems, you will need the rectangular x, y,
and z locations of points in space and components of vectors before proceeding
with the computations. If you are given the components upfront, then you are
set to move forward, but otherwise, you will need to transform one coordinate
system into rectangular coordinates.

Thinking Deeper 2.4.2 Right-Handed Coordinate Systems.

Does it matter which way the axes are oriented? Is it OK to make the x
axis point left or the y axis point down?

    The answers to the questions above, like                y
so many in life, are "It depends." If you are      z
simply summing the forces of a system, you
typically can select any perpendicular axes                            x
you wish, but for systems involving any
cross-product relationships (like the rota-    Figure 2.4.3 Right-handed
tional moments you'll learn about in Chap-     coordinate system.
ter 4), we need to use a standard orien-
tation. In mathematics and engineering,
the default is a right-handed coordinate
system, where the coordinate axes are ori-
ented according to the right-hand rule
shown in the figure.

    To apply the right-hand rule, orient
your thumb and first two fingers at right
angles to each other and align them with
three coordinate axes. Starting with your
thumb, name the axes in alphabetical or-
der x-y-z. In mathematical terms, when
we cross the x-axis into the y-axis, we need
to get the direction of the z-axis.

2.4.2 Direction Cosine Angles

The direction of a vector in two-dimensional systems could be expressed clearly
with a single angle measured from a reference axis, but adding an additional
dimension means that one angle is no longer enough.

    One way to define the direction of a three-dimensional vector is by using
direction cosine angles, also commonly known as coordinate direction an-
gles. The direction cosine angles are the angles between the positive x, y, and
z axes to a given vector and are traditionally named x, y, and z. Three-
dimensional vectors, components, and angles are often difficult to visualize be-
cause they do not commonly lie in the Cartesian planes.

Figure 2.4.4 Direction Cosine Angles

    We can relate the components of a vector to its direction cosine angles using
the following equations.

cos x = Ax      cos y = Ay           cos z = Az                (2.4.1)
           |A|             |A|                  |A|

    These cosine relationships come from the red, green, and blue right triangles
shown in Figure 2.4.4, where the side adjacent to each angle is the component and
the hypotenuse is the full vector. Note that the component in the numerator of
each direction cosine equation is positive or negative as defined by the coordinate
system, and the vector magnitude in the denominator is always positive.

    From these equations, we can conclude that:

· Direction cosines are signed value between -1 and 1.

· Direction cosine angles must always be between 0 and 180 or

                0  n  180.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                                   33

· Any direction cosine angle greater than 90 indicates a negative component
   along that respective axis. Spatially this is because all direction cosine
   angles are measured from the positive side of each axis. Mathematically
   this is because the cosine of any angle between 90 and 180 degrees is
   numerically negative.

Example 2.4.5 Direction Cosine Angles.

 x

Solution. Since the three components of F are perpendicular, we can
apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the magnitude of F .

   F = |F| = Fx2 + Fy2 + Fz2

             = 202 + (-30)2 + 602 lbf
             = 70 lbf

Direction cosine angles are equal to the inverse cosine of each Cartesian
force component divided by the force magnitude.

x = cos-1 Fx = cos-1 20 = 73.4
   |F|  70

y = cos-1 Fy = cos-1 -30 = 115.38
   |F|  70

z = cos-1 Fz = cos-1 60 = 31.0
   |F|  70
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  34

   Since the direction cosine angles are measured from the positive x, y, and
   z axes, the negative component of Fy means that y > 90, while both x
   and z are less than 90 as their components are positive.

2.4.3 Spherical Coordinates

In spherical coordinates, points are specified with these three coordinates
   · r, the radial distance from the origin to the tip of the vector,

       axis to the projection of the vector onto the xy plane, and

       · Coordinate r is not needed since all points are on the surface of the
           globe.

       · Longitude is measured 0 to 180 East or West of the prime meridian,
           rather than 0 to 360 counter-clockwise from the x axis.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                      36

   · Latitude is measured 0 to 90 North or South of the equator,
      whereas polar angle  is 0 to 180 measured from the "North Pole".

When vectors are specified using cylindrical coordinates the magnitude of the
vector is used instead of distance r from the origin to the point.

    When the two given spherical angles are defined in the manner shown here,
the rectangular components of the vector A = (A ;  ; ) are found thus:

      A = A sin                                    (2.4.2)

      Az = A cos                                   (2.4.3)
      Ax = A cos  = A sin  cos                     (2.4.4)
      Ay = A sin  = A sin  sin                     (2.4.5)

    Reflect on the equations above. Can you think through the process of how
they were derived? The generalized steps are as follows. First, draw an accurate
sketch of the given information and define the right triangles related to both 
and . Then use trig identities on the right triangle involving the vector, the
z axis and angle  to find Az, and A, the projection of A onto the xy plane.
Finally, use trig identities on the right triangle involving vector A and  to find
the remaining components of A.

                     centered at the origin with force F =
                     20, -30, 60 lbf.

                  y Find the spherical coordinates of

                     F.

x

Solution. To represent F in spherical coordinates, we must find the ra-
dial distance r, the azimuthal angle , and the polar angle .
Coordinate r is simply the magnitude of force F. Since the three compo-
nents of F are perpendicular, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to
find it.

   F = |F| = r =  F2   +              F2   +  F2

                                      = 202 + (-30)2 + 602 lbf

                                      = 70 lbf

Azimuthal angle  measures the angle between the x axis and the projec-
tion of F onto the xy plane, Fzy.
Using a right triangle with sides Fx, Fy, and Fxy, we can find  using the
inverse tangent of the ratio of the opposite to adjacent sides.

 = tan-1 Fy = tan-1 -30 = -56.31
Fx       20

This angle is negative because it is measured clockwise from the positive
x axis, opposite the standard CCW direction.
The polar angle  is measured down from the +z axis to the vector F. We
can find it using a right triangle with sides F , Fz, and Fxy. Note that  is
the same as the direction cosine angle z.

 = z = cos-1 Fz = cos-1 60 = 31.0
    |F|      70

Also notice that the azimuthal angle  is smaller than the direction cosine

angle x, since  is in the xy plane, but x is a 3D angle from the x axis
to the vector F.

2.4.4 Cylindrical Coordinates

The cylindrical coordinate system is seldom used in statics, however, it is useful
in certain geometries. Cylindrical coordinates extend two-dimensional polar co-
ordinates by adding a z coordinate indicating the distance above or below the
xy plane.

    Points are specified with these three cylindrical coordinates.

   · r, the radius of the cylinder. This is the distance from the origin to the
       projection of the tip of the vector onto the xy plane,

   · , the azimuthal angle, measured counter-clockwise from the positive x
       axis to the projection of the vector onto the xy plane

   · z, the vertical height of the vector tip.

    You can use the interactive diagram in this section to practice visualizing and
finding the components of a vector in all of these coordinate systems. You should
be able to find the x, y, and z coordinates given direction angles, spherical or
cylindrical coordinates, and vice-versa.

                 y Find the cylindrical coordinates

                    of F.

x

Solution. To represent F in cylindrical coordinates, we must find the
radial distance, r, the azimuthal angle, , and the axial coordinate, z.
In cylindrical coordinates, r is the radius of the cylinder rather than the
radius of the enclosing sphere. r is the projection of F onto the xy plane,
Fxy, and can be found by applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the x and
y components of F.

      r = Fxy =  F2   +  F2

                   x       y

      = 202 + (-30)2 lbf
      = 36.06 lbf

The azimuthal angle  is the same in both cylindrical and spherical coor-
dinates. It measures the angle between the x axis and the projection of F
onto the xy plane.  can be found using a right triangle in the xy plane
with sides Fx and Fy.

Finally, the z component is the vertical component of the force, Fz, which

2.5 Unit Vectors

   Key Questions

       · Why are unit vectors useful?

       · What are the unit vectors along the Cartesian x, y, and z axes?

       · How do you find the force vector components of known force magni-
           tude along a geometric line?

       · How can you find unit vector components from direction cosine an-
           gles?

    A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of one and no units. As such, a
unit vector represents a pure direction. By convention, a unit vector is indicated
by a hat over a vector symbol. This may sound like a new concept, but it's a
simple one, directly related to the unit circle, the Pythagorean Theorem, and
the definitions of sine and cosine.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  42

2.5.1 Cartesian Unit Vectors

A unit vector can point in any direction, but because they occur so frequently
the unit vectors in each of the three Cartesian coordinate directions are given
their own symbols, which are:

   · i, for the unit vector pointing in the x direction,

   · j, for the unit vector pointing in the y direction, and

   · k, for the unit vector pointing in the z direction..

                         Figure 2.5.1 Unit Vector Interactive

    Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the triangle gives the equation for a
unit circle

                                       cos2  + sin2  = 12

    No matter what angle a unit vector makes with the x axis, cos  and sin 
are its scalar components. This relation assumes that the angle  is measured
from the x axis, if it is measured from the y axis the sine and cosine functions
reverse, with sin  defining the horizontal component and the cos  defining the
vertical component.

    The x and y components of a point on the unit circle are also the scalar
components of F^, so

Fx = cos   = F^ = cos , sin .
Fy = sin

2.5.2 Relation between Vectors and Unit Vectors

When a purely-directional unit vector is multiplied by a scalar value it is scaled by

that amount. For example, when a unit vector pointing to the right is multiplied

by 100 N the result is a 100 N vector pointing to the right. When a unit vector

pointing up is multiplied by -50 N, the negative magnitude flips the direction

of the unit vector and the result is a 50 N vector pointing down.

In general,

                 F = |F| F^,                                       (2.5.1)

where |F| is the magnitude of vector F, and F^ is the unit vector pointing in the
direction of F.

    Solving equation (2.5.1) for F^ gives the approach to find the unit vector of

known vector F.

    The process is straightforward-- divide the vector by its magnitude.

                              F^ = F                               (2.5.2)
                                    |F|

    To emphasize that unit vectors are pure direction, recall that vectors con-
sist of both a magnitude and direction, so when we divide a vector by its own
magnitude we are just left with direction.

             F   [vector] @[m@ag@n@it@ud@@e] · [direction]  = [direction]
unit vector = =               =          @@@@

for F in terms of its unit vector F^.

    positive x-axis.
    Solution. In polar coordinates, the unit vector is a vector of magnitude
   1, pointing in the same direction as the force, so, by inspection

                        F = (100 N ; 60°)
                        F^ = (1 ; 60°)

In rectangular coordinates, first express F in terms of its x and y compo-

nents.

2.5.3 Force Vectors from Position Vectors

Unit vectors are generally the best approach when working with forces and dis-
tances in three dimensions.

    For example, when the locations of two points on the line of action of a
force are known, the unit vector of the line of action can be found and used
to determine the components of the force acting along that line. This can be
accomplished as follows, where A and B are points on the line of action.

   1. Use the problem geometry to find AB, the displacement vector from point
       A to point B.
       You can either subtract the coordinates of the starting point A from the
       coordinates of the destination point B,

                         A = (Ax, Ay, Az)
                         B = (Bx, By, Bz)
                       AB = (Bx - Ax) i + (By - Ay) j + (Bz - Az) k, or

       or, write the displacements directly by noting the change in the x, y, and
       z coordinates when moving from A to B.

                                  ABx = x = Bx - Ax
                                   ABy = y = ABy = By - Ay
                                   ABz = z = Bz - Ax
                                    AB = ABx i + ABy j + ABz k

       The result is the same with either method.

   2. Find the distance between point A and point B using the Pythagorean
       Theorem. This distance is also the magnitude of AB or |AB|.

                           |AB| = (ABx)2 + (ABy)2 + (ABz)2

3. Find AB, the unit vector from A to B, by dividing vector AB by its
   magnitude. This is a unitless vector with a magnitude of 1 which points
   from A to B.

                                 AB = ABx , ABy , ABz
                                            |AB| |AB| |AB|

4. Finally, multiply the magnitude of the force by the unit vector AB to get
   force FAB.

FAB = FAB AB
      = FAB ABx , ABy , ABz
                 |AB| |AB| |AB|

           Solution.

                                   FAB = FAB AB
                                         = 5 kN -0.7, -0.23, 0.67
                                         = -3.51, -1.17, 3.36 kN

    Given the properties of unit vectors, there are some conceptual checks you
can make after computing unit vector components which can prevent subsequent
errors.

   · The signs of unit vector components need to match the signs of the original
       position vector. A unit vector has the same line of action and sense as the
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  48

   position vector but is scaled down to one unit in magnitude.

· Components of a unit vector must be between -1 and 1. If the magnitude
   of a unit vector is one, then it is impossible for it to have rectangular
   components larger than one.

2.5.4 Unit Vectors and Direction Cosines

If you look closely at the right side of equation (2.4.1), you will see that each
equation consists of a component divided by the total vector magnitude. These
are the same equations just used to find unit vectors. Thus, the cosine of each
direction cosine angle collectively also computes the components of the unit
vector; hence we can write an equation for A^ , i.e. , the unit vector along A.

A^ = cos x i + cos y j + cos z k

    Combining the Pythagorean Theorem with our knowledge of unit vectors and
direction cosine angles gives this result: if you know two of the three direction
cosine angles you can manipulate the following equation to find the third.

cos2 x + cos2 y + cos2 z = 1         (2.5.3)

2.6 Vector Addition

    Key Questions

       · How do you set up vectors for graphical addition using the Triangle
           Rule?

       · Does it matter which vector you start with when using the Triangle
           Rule?

       · Why can you separate a two-dimensional vector equation into two
           independent equations to solve for up to two unknowns?

       · If you and another student define vectors using different direction
           coordinate systems, will you end up with the same resultant vector?

       · What is the preferred technique to add vectors in three-dimensional
           systems?

    In this section we will look at several different methods of vector addition.
Vectors being added together are called the components, and the sum of the
components is called the resultant vector.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  49

    These different methods are tools for your statics toolbox. They give you
multiple different ways to think about vector addition and to approach a problem.
Your goal should be to learn to use them all and to identify which approach will
be the easiest to use in a given situation.

2.6.1 Triangle Rule of Vector Addition

All methods of vector addition are ultimately based on the tip-to-tail method
discussed in a one-dimensional context in Subsection 2.2.1. There are two ways
to draw or visualize adding vectors in two or three dimensions, the Triangle
Rule and Parallelogram Rule. Both are equivalent.

   · Triangle Rule.

       Place the tail of one vector at the tip of the other vector, then draw the
       resultant from the first vector's tail to the final vector's tip.

   · Parallelogram Rule.

       Place both vectors' tails at the origin, then complete a parallelogram with
       lines parallel to each vector through the tip of the other. The resultant is
       equal to the diagonal from the tails to the opposite corner.

    The interactive below shows two forces A and B pulling on a particle at the
origin, and the appropriate diagram for the triangle or parallelogram rule. Both
approaches produce the same resultant force R as expected.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  50

                Live Link

Figure 2.6.1 Vector Addition Methods

2.6.2 Graphical Vector Addition

Graphical vector addition involves drawing a scaled diagram using either the
parallelogram or triangle rule, and then measuring the magnitudes and directions
from the diagram. Graphical solutions work well enough for two-dimensional
problems where all the vectors live in the same plane and can be drawn on a
sheet of paper, but are not very useful for three-dimensional problems unless
you use technology.

    If you carefully draw the triangle accurately to scale and use a protractor and
ruler you can measure the magnitude and direction of the resultant. However,
your answer will only be as precise as your diagram and your ability to read your
tools. If you use technology such as GeoGebra or a CAD program to make the
diagram, your answer will be precise. The interactive in Figure 2.6.1 may be
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  51

useful for this.
    Even though the graphical approach has limitations, it is worth your atten-

tion because it provides a good way to visualize the effects of multiple forces,
to quickly estimate ballpark answers, and to visualize the diagrams you need to
use alternate methods to follow.

2.6.3 Trigonometric Vector Addition

You can get a precise answer from the triangle or parallelogram rule by

   1. drawing a quick diagram using either rule,

   2. identifying three known sides or angles,

   3. using trigonometry to solve for the unknown sides and angles.

    The trigonometric tools you will need are found in Appendix B.
    Using triangle-based geometry to solve vector problems is a quick and pow-
erful tool, but includes the following limitations:

   · There are only three sides in a triangle; thus vectors can only be added
       two at a time. If you need to add three or more vectors using this method,
       you must add the first two, then add the third to that sum and so on.

   · If you fail to draw the correct vector triangle or identify the known sides
       and angles, you will not find the correct answer.

   · The trigonometric functions produce scalar values. You can use them to
       find the magnitudes the angles between vectors, but the results are not,
       by themselves, vectors.

    When you need to find the resultant of more than two vectors, it is generally
best to use the algebraic methods described below.

2.6.4 Orthogonal Components

Any arbitrary two-dimensional vector F can be broken into two component vec-
tors which are the sides of a parallelogram having F as its diagonal. The process
of finding components of a vector in particular directions is called vector reso-
lution. While a vector can be resolved into components in any two directions,
it's generally most useful to resolve them into rectangular or orthogonal com-
ponents, where the parallelogram is a rectangle and the components are perpen-
dicular.

    There are an infinite number of possible rectangles to choose from, so each
vector has an infinite number of sets of orthogonal components. However, the
most important set occurs when the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the x
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS  52

and y axes. These orthogonal components are given x and y subscripts indicate
that they're aligned with the coordinate axes. For vector F,

F = Fx + Fy = Fx i + Fy j,           (2.6.1)

where Fx and Fy are the scalar components of F. The advantage of this choice
of components is that vector calculations can be replaced with ordinary algebric
calculation on scalar values for each orthogonal direction.

    Alternately, you may rotate the coordinate system to any other convenient
angle, and find the components in the directions of the rotated coordinate axes
x and y. In either case, the vector is the sum of the rectangular components

2.6.5 Algebraic Addition of Components

While the parallelogram rule and the graphical and trigonometric methods are
useful tools for visualizing and finding the sum of two vectors, they are not par-
ticularly suited for adding more than two vectors or working in three dimensions.

    Consider vector R which is the sum of several vectors A, B, C and perhaps
more. Vectors A, B and C are the components of R, and the R is the resultant
of A,B and C.

    It is easy enough to say that R = A + B + C, but how can we calculate R?
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS              54

You could draw the vectors arranged tip-to-tail and then use the triangle rule
to add the first two components, then use it again to add the third component
to that sum, and so forth until all the components have been added. The final
sum is the resultant, R. The process gets progressively more tedious the more
components there are to sum.

    This section introduces an alternate method to add multiple vectors which
is straightforward, efficient and robust. This is called algebraic method, because
the vector addition is replaced with a process of algebraic addition of scalar
components. The algebraic technique works equally well for two and three-
dimensional vectors, and for summing any number of vectors.

    To find the sum of multiple vectors using the algebraic method:

1. Find the scalar components of each component vector in the x and y
   directions using the P to R procedure described in Subsection 2.3.3.

2. Algebraically sum the scalar components in each coordinate direction. The
   scalar components will be positive if they point right or up, negative if they
   point left or down. These sums are the scalar components of the resultant.

3. Resolve the resultant's components to find the magnitude and direction
   of the resultant vector using the R to P procedure described in Subsec-
   tion 2.3.3.

    The resultant FR is the simply the algebraic sum of the components in each
coordinate direction.

                        FR = Fx i + Fy j + Fz k

or in bracket notation

                        FR = Fx, Fy, Fz          (2.6.3)

.
    This process is illustrated in the following interactive diagram and in the

next example.

    Example 2.6.4 Vector Addition.
   Vector A = 200 N 45 counter-clockwise from the x axis, and vector
    B = 300 N70 counter-clockwise from the y axis.
    Find the resultant R = A + B by addition of scalar components.
    Solution.

        Use the given information to draw a
   sketch of the situation. By imagining or
   sketching the parallelogram rule, it should
   be apparent that the resultant vector points
   up and to the left.

Ax = 200 N cos 45 = 141.4 N  Bx = -300 N sin 70 = -281.9 N
Ay = 200 N sin 45 = 141.4 N  By = 300 N cos 70 = 102.6 N
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                          56

Rx = Ax + Bx                    Ry = Ay + By
    = 141.4 N - 281.9 N             = 141.4 N + 102.6 N
    = -140.5 N                      = 244.0 N

R=  R2    +  R2    =  281.6  N   = tan-1 Ry = -60.1
                                               Rx
       x        y

This answer indicates that the resultant points down and to the left, which
is odd because the parallelogram rule shows that the resultant should point
up and to the left.
This occurs because the calculator always returns angles in the first or
fourth quadrant for tan-1. To get the actual direction of the resultant,
add 180 to the calculator result.

                       = -60.1 + 180 = 119.9

The final answer for the magnitude and direction of the resultant is

                                      R = 281.6 N119.9
   measured counter-clockwise from the x axis.

    The process for adding three-dimensional vectors is exactly the same, except
that the z component is included as well. This interactive allows you to input the
three-dimensional vector components of forces A and B and view the resultant
force R which is the sum of A and B.

2.6.6 Vector Subtraction

Like one-dimensional vector subtraction, the easiest way to handle two-dimensional
vector subtraction is by taking the negative of a vector followed by vector addi-
tion. Multiplying a vector by -1 preserves its magnitude but flips its direction,
which has the effect of changing the sign of the scalar components.

                                       A - B = A + (-B)

    After negating the second vector you can choose any technique you prefer for
vector addition.

2.7 Dot Products

   Key Questions

       · What are dot products used for?

       · What does it mean when the dot product of two vectors is zero?

       · How do you use a dot product to find the angle between two vectors?

       · What does it mean when the scalar component of the projection
            projA B is negative?

    Unlike ordinary algebra where there is only one way to multiply numbers,
there are two distinct vector multiplication operations: dot product and the
cross product. Alternately, the first is referred to as the scalar product
because its result is a scalar, and the second as the vector product because its
result is a vector. The dot product and its applications will be discussed in this
section and the cross product in the next.

2.7.1 Calculation of the Dot product

For two vectors A = Ax, Ay, Az and B = Bx, By, Bz, the dot product multi-
plication is computed by summing the products of the components.

                   A · B = AxBx + AyBy + AzBz                (2.7.1)

It can be shown that an alternate, equivalent method to compute the dot

product is

                   A · B = |A||B| cos  = A B cos             (2.7.2)

where  in the equation is the angle between the two vectors and |A| and |B| are
the magnitudes of A and B.

    We can conclude from the second equation that the dot product of two per-
pendicular vectors is zero, because cos 90 = 0, and that the dot product of two
parallel vectors equals the product of their magnitudes.

    When dotting unit vectors that have a magnitude of one, the dot products
of a unit vector with itself is one and the dot product two perpendicular unit
vectors is zero, so for i, j, and k we have

            i·i=1  j·i=0                           k·i=0
            i·j=0  j·j=1                           k·j=0
            i·k=0  j·k=0                           k·k=1

Dot products are commutative, associative and distributive:
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                   59

1. Commutative. The order does not matter.

        A·B=B·A                                               (2.7.3)

2. Associative. It does not matter whether you multiply a scalar value C
   by the final dot product, or either of the individual vectors, you will still
   get the same answer.

        C (A · B) = (C A) · B = A · (C B)                     (2.7.4)

3. Distributive. If you are dotting one vector A with the sum of two more

(B + C), you can either add B + C first, or dot A by both and add the final

value.

        A · (B + C) = (A · B) + (A · C)                       (2.7.5)

    Dot products can be used to compute the magnitude of a vector, determine
the angle between two vectors, and find the rectangular component or projection
of a vector in a specified direction. These applications will be discussed in the
following sections.

2.7.2 Magnitude of a Vector

Dot products can be used to find vector magnitudes. When a vector is dotted
with itself using (2.7.1), the result is the square of the magnitude of the vector.
(Recall that |A| and A are alternate notations for the magnitude of vector A.)

        A · A = |A|2 = A2.                                    (2.7.6)

    The proof is trivial. By the definition of the dot product (2.7.1) and the
Pythagorean theorem:

        A · A = AxAx + AyAy
               = Ax2 + Ay2 = A2
               = |A|2

Taking the square root of each side gives the magnitude of A  (2.7.7)
                                       
                                         A · A = A = |A|.

The result is similar for three-dimensional vectors.

Example 2.7.1 Find Vector Magnitude using the Dot Product.

Find the magnitude of vector F with components Fx = 30 N, Fy = -40 N
and Fz = 50 N
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                            60

Solution.

               F = 30 N, -40 N, 50 N

           F · F = Fx2 + Fy2 + Fz2
                 = (30 N)2 + (-40 N)2 + (50 N)2
                 = 5000 N2

                            
              F = |F| = F · F

                    
                 = 5000 N2
                 = 70.7 N

2.7.3 Angle between Two Vectors

A second application of the dot product is to find the angle between two vectors.
Equation (2.7.2) provides the procedure.

           A · B = |A||B| cos                                  (2.7.8)
           cos  = A · B

                     |A||B|

Example 2.7.2 Angle between Orthogonal Unit Vectors.

Find the angle between i = 1, 0, 0 and j = 0, 1, 0.
Solution.

                           cos  = i · j
                                     |i||j|
                                     (1)(0) + (0)(1) + (0)(0)

                                  =
                                                (1)(1)

                                  =0

                                = cos-1(0)
                                  = 90

This shows that i and j are perpendicular to each other.

                   24500

           =
              (229.1)(172.4)

           = 0.620

            = cos-1(0.620)
             = 51.7

2.7.4 Vector Projection

The dot product is used to find the projection of one vector onto another. You
can think of a projection of B on A as a vector the length of the shadow of B
on the line of action of A when the sun is directly above A. More precisely, the
projection of B onto A produces the rectangular component of B in the direction
parallel to A. This is one side of a rectangle aligned with A, having B as its
diagonal.

    This is illustrated in Figure 2.7.4, where u is the projection of B onto A, or
alternately u is the rectangular component of B in the direction of A.

    In this text we will use the symbols

   · projA B to mean the vector projection of B on A

   · | projA B| to mean the magnitude of the vector projection, a positive or
       zero-valued scalar, and

   ·  projA B to mean the scalar projection. This value represents the
       component of B in the A direction, and can have a positive, zero, or
       negative value.

    As we have mentioned before, the magnitude of a vector is its length and is
always positive or zero, while a scalar component is a signed value that can be
positive or negative. When a scalar component is multiplied by a unit vector
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                          62

the result is a vector in that direction when the scalar component is positive, or
180 opposite when the scalar component is negative.

              Live Link

Figure 2.7.4 Vector projection in two dimensions.

The interactive shows that the projection is the adjacent side of a right

triangle with B as the hypotenuse. From the definition of the dot product (2.7.2)

we find that

                 A · B = A(B cos ) = A  projA B,          (2.7.9)

where B cos  is the scalar component of the projection. So, the dot product of

A and B gives us the projection of B onto A times the magnitude of A. This

value will be positive when  < 90, negative when  > 90, and zero when the

vectors are perpendicular because of the properties of the cosine function.

So, to find the scalar value of the projection of B onto A we divide by the

magnitude of A.              A·B A

                  projA B =  = ·B=A·B                  ^  (2.7.10)

                             AA

where A^ = A is the unit vector in the dirction of A.
               A
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                   63

    If you want the vector projection of B onto A, as opposed to the scalar
projection we just found, multiply the scalar projection by the unit vector A^ .

projA B =  projA BA^ = A^ · B A^                      (2.7.11)

Similarly, the vector projection of A onto B is

projB A =  projB AB^ = A · B^ B^                      (2.7.12)

The spatial interpretation of the results the scalar projection  projA B is
· Positive values mean that A and B are generally in the same direction.

· Negative values mean that A and B are generally in opposite directions.

· Zero means that A and B are perpendicular.

· Magnitude smaller than B This is the most common answer. This means
   that the vectors are neither parallel nor perpendicular.

· Magnitude equal to B means that the vectors point in the same direction,
   and all of B acts in the direction of A.

· Magnitude larger than B This answer is impossible. Check your algebra;
   you might have forgotten to divide by the magnitude of A.

2.7.5 Perpendicular Components

The final application of dot products is to find the component of one vector
perpendicular to another.

    To find the component of B perpen-
dicular to A, first find the vector pro-
jection of B on A, then subtract that
from B. What remains is the perpen-
dicular component.

B = B - projA B  (2.7.13)

Example 2.7.7 Dot Products.

A cable pulls with tension T = -50, 80, 40 N on a 0.4 m long anchor AB
embedded in a concrete wall. The anchor lies in the xy plane at an angle
 = 30 from the x axis.

For the system above, compute the following:

(a) Find the dot product of the cable tension T and the anchor AB

Answer.

                 T · AB = -33.32 N·m
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                     65

Solution. When you know the magnitudes and angle between two
vectors, it is easiest to use the second dot product equation (2.7.2),
but in this case it will be easier to find the components of AB and
use (2.7.1).

  T = -50, 80, 40 N
AB = 0.4 cos 30, -0.4 sin 30, 0 m

     = 0.3464, -0.2, 0 m

T · AB = Tx (ABx) + Ty (ABy) + Tz (ABz)
         = (-50 N) (0.3464 m) + (80 N) (-0.2 m) + (40 N) (0 m)
         = -33.32 N·m

The units of a dot product are the product of the units of the two
vectors.

(b) Find the angle  between the cable tension T and the anchor AB.

Answer.

          = 144.38

Solution. With the dot product T · AB known from the previous
step, we can use the (2.7.2) to find the angle between force T and
anchor.

                   T · AB = |T||AB| cos  = -33.32 N·m

The magnitude of |AB| = 0.4 m was given but we need to calculate
the magnitude of |T|,

         |T| = (-50)2 + 802 + 402 = 102.47 N

                         = cos-1 T · AB
                                     |T||AB|

                          = cos-1 -33.32 N·m
                                      (102.47 N) (0.4 m)

                          = 144.38

Note that  > 90 correctly corresponds to the negative dot product
and indicates that the two vectors generally oppose each other.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                        66

(c) Find the scalar projection of the the cable tension T onto the anchor
     AB.

Answer.

             || projAB T|| = -83.30 N

Solution 1. Recall from Subsection 2.7.4 that the scalar projection
is the scalar component of one vector in the direction of another, in
other words, how much of one vector is parallel to another. This is
one of the most direct and practical applications of the dot product.

The dot product of T with AB gives the product of the length of the
anchor AB and the scalar projection of the tension in the direction
of the anchor.

                 T · AB = AB (T cos ) = AB projAB T

and has units of N-m.
To find the projection, divide the dot product by the magnitude of
AB

                     projAB T = T · AB AB = -33.32 N&m& 0.4 &m&
                                   = -83.30 N

Solution 2. Alternately, you can apply (2.7.10) and calculate the
calculate the dot product of force vector T with the unit vector AB.

First, find the unit vector

AB = AB = 0.3464, -0.2, 0 m = 0.866, -0.5, 0
         AB               0.4 m

Or, since AB is in the xy plane with its direction defined by the
 = 30, the unit vector AB is found

         AB = cos 30, - sin 30, 0 = 0.866, -0.5, 0.

Then find the projection

 projAB T = T · AB
               = (-50 N) (0.866) + (80 N) (-0.5) + (40 N) (0)
               = -83.30 N

(d) Find the vector projection of the cable tension T onto the anchor
     AB.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                           67

Answer.

         projAB T = -72.14, 41.65, 0 N

Solution. The vector projection is the scalar projection value mul-
tiplied by a unit direction vector to turn it a vector. So we multiply

the scalar projection with the unit vector of AB to compute the
vector projection of T onto AB.

         projAB T =  projAB T · AB
                    = 83.301 N (0.866, -0.5, 0)
                    = -72.14, 41.65, 0 N

(e) Find the vector portion of cable tension T perpendicular to the an-
     chor AB.

Answer.

         TAB = 22.14, 38.35, 40 N

Solution. Recall that a two-dimensional vector can be represented
by the sum of two perpendicular components. In the same way, a
right triangle can be represented by a vector along the hypotenuse
equal to the sum of the two right-triangle sides.

Thus, any vector can be divided into two vectors parallel and per-
pendicular to another line. The vector projection projAB T, from
Part (d), is the portion of T parallel to AB. So the sum of T can be
expressed as the parallel and perpendicular terms:

         T = projAB T + (T  AB)

We want to find the part of T perpendicular to AB, so we can re-
arrange the equation to find:

               T  AB = T - projAB T
                          = -50, 80, 40 - -72.14, 41.65, 0
                          = 22.14, 38.35, 40 N

Nice effort if you worked through all the parts of this example. Graphically
the results for parts (b), (d), and (e) are shown in this diagram.

2.8 Cross Products

    Key Questions

       · How is a cross product different than a dot product?

       · What is a determinant?

       · What defines a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system?

       · How do you use the cross-product circle to find the cross product of
           two unit vectors?

    The vector cross product is a multipliation operation applied to two vectors
which produces a third mutually perpendicular vector as a result. It's sometimes
called the vector product to emphasize this and to distinguish it from the dot
product which produces a scalar result. The × symbol is used to indicate this
operation.

    Cross products are used in mechanics to find the moment of a force about a
point.

Figure 2.8.1 Direction of a cross product.
    The cross product is a vector multiplication process defined by

           A × B = A B sin  u^.                                      (2.8.1)

The result is a vector mutually perpendicular to both with a sense determined
by the right-hand rule. If A and B are in the xy plane, this is

           A × B = (AyBx - AxBy) k.                                  (2.8.2)

The operation is not commutative, in fact reversing the order introduces a neg-
ative sign.

                                       A × B = -B × A.

    The magnitude of the cross product is the product of the perpendicular
component of A with the magnitude of B,. This is the area of the parallelogram
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                               70

formed by vectors A and B. The magnitude of the cross product is zero if A and
B are parallel, and it is maximum when they are perpendicular. The magnitude
of the cross product of two perpendicular unit vectors is one.

    Notice that the cross product equation are similar to the dot product, except
that sin is used rather than cos and the product includes a unit vector u^ making
the result a vector. This unit vector u^ is simple to find in a two-dimensional
problem as it will always be perpendicular to the page, but for three-dimensional
cross products a vector determinant is used, as discussed in Subsection 2.8.3.

2.8.1 Direction of the Vector Cross Product

The direction of a cross product is determined by the right-hand rule. There
are two ways to apply the right-hand rule, the three-finger method, and the
point-and-curl method. You don't need both, but you will need to master at
least one to find the direction of cross products.

    The three-finger method uses the fact that your extended index finger, middle
finger, and thumb are all roughly mutually perpendicular. If you align your index
finger with the first vector and your middle finger with the second, then your
thumb will point in the direction of the cross product. Alternately, if you align
your thumb with the first vector and your index finger with the second, your
middle finger will point in the direction of the cross-product.

    The point-and-curl method involves placing your right hand flat with your
fingertips pointing in the direction of the the first vector. Then rotate your
hand until the second vector is can curl your fingers around your thumb. In this
position, your thumb defines the direction of the cross product.

2.8.2 Cross Product of Unit Vectors

The Figure 2.8.4(a) demonstrates how you apply these techniques to find the
cross product of i × j. Assuming the x axis points right and the y axis points up,
the cross product points in the positive z direction. Recalling that the magnitude
of the cross product of two peperpedicular unit vectors is one, we conclude that

                                             i × j = k.

(a) Using the three-finger method. (b) Using the point-and-curl method.
Figure 2.8.4 Crossing i into j to get k.

     Similarly, the cross products of the other pairs of vectors are:

i×i=0       i×j=k                                  i × k = -j
j × i = -k  j×j=0                                  j×k=i
k×i=j       k × j = -i                             k×k=0

    An alternate way to remember this is to use    Figure 2.8.5 Unit vector
the cross-product circle shown. For example        cross product circle.
when you cross i with j you are going in the pos-
itive (counter-clockwise) direction around the
blue inner circle and thus the answer is +k. But
when you cross j into i you go in the negative
(clockwise) direction around the circle and thus
get a -k. Remember that the order of cross
products matter. If you put the vectors in the
wrong order you will introduce a sign error.

    If you have any negative unit vectors it is easiest to pull out the negative
signs before you take the cross product, like the following.

-j × i = (-1) (j × i) = (-1)(-k) = +k

2.8.3 Cross Product of Arbitrary Vectors

The cross product of two arbitrary three-dimensional vectors can be calculated
by evaluating the determinant of this 3 × 3 matrix.

              i jk                                        (2.8.3)
A × B = Ax Ay Az

             Bx By Bz

    Here, the first row contains the unit vectors, the second row contains the
components of A, and the third row, the components of B. The determinant of
this 3 × 3 matrix is evaluated using the method of cofactors, as follows

A × B = + Ay Az i - Ax Az j + Ax Ay k.                    (2.8.4)
By Bz                                       Bx Bz  Bx By

Each term contains a 2 × 2 determinant which is evaluated with the formula

a b = ad - bc.                                            (2.8.5)
cd

    After simplifying, the resulting formula for a three-dimensional cross product
is

A × B = (AyBz - AzBy) i - (AxBz - AzBx) j + (AxBy - AyBx) k. (2.8.6)

    In practice, the easiest way to remember this equation is to use the aug-
mented determinant below, where the first two columns have been copied and
placed after the determinant. The cross product is then calculated by adding
the product of the red diagonals and subtracting the product of blue diagonals.
The result is identical to (2.8.6).

Figure 2.8.6 Augmented determinant

In two dimensions, vectors A and B have no z components, so (2.8.6) reduces

to
                                      i jk

A × B = Ax Ay 0 = (AxBy - AyBx) k.                        (2.8.7)

Bx By 0

This equation produces the same result as equation (2.8.1) and you may use it
if it is more convenient.
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                         73

Example 2.8.7 2D Cross Product.

The two vectors A and B shown lie in the xy plane. Determine the cross
product A × B.

P

Solution 1. In this solution we will apply equation (2.8.1).

                                  A × B = A B sin  u^

The direction of the cross product is determined by applying the right-
hand rule. With the right hand, rotating A towards B we find that our
thumb points into the xy plane, so the direction of u^ is -k.

A × B = (60 N)(40 N) sin 45(-k)
        = 1, 697 N2 (-k)
        = -1, 697 N2 k

Solution 2. In this solution we will use (2.8.7).
First, establish a coordinate system with the origin P and with the x axis
aligned with A, then find the rectangular components and apply the cross
product equation.

Ax = 60 N                                Ay = 0 N
Bx = 40 N cos 45                         By = -40 N sin 45

    = 28.28 N                                = -28.28 N

A × B = (AxBy - AyBx)k
        = (60)(-28.28) - (0)(28.28) N2k
        = -1697 N2 k

Example 2.8.8 3D Cross Product.

Find the cross product of A = 2, 4, -1 m and B = 10, 25, 20 N.
Here, we are crossing a distanceA and with a forceB. This calculation is
equivalent to finding the moment about a point P caused by force B acting
CHAPTER 2. FORCES AND OTHER VECTORS                                         74

distance A from P . You will learn about moments in Chapter 4.

Solution 1. To solve, set up the augmented determinant and evaluate
it by adding the left-to-right diagonals and subtracting the right-to-left
diagonals using equation (2.8.6).

              i j ki j
A × B = 2 4 -1 2 4

             10 25 20 10 25

         = (4 · 20) i + (-1 · 10) j + (2 · 25) k - (4 · 10) k - (-1 · 25) i - (2 · 20) j
         = (80 + 25) i + (-10 - 40) j + (50 - 40) k
         = 105, -50, 10 N·m

Thus, the force B creates a three-dimensional rotational moment equal to
105, -50, 10 N·m.
Solution 2. Calculating three-dimensional cross products by hand is
tedious and error-prone. Whenever you can, you should use technology to
do the grunt work for you and focus on the meaning of the results. In this
solution, we will use an embedded Sage calculator to calculate the cross
product. This same calculator can be used to do other problems.
Given:

                                   A = 2, 4, -1 m
                                    B = 10, 25, 20 N

.
A and B are defined in the first two lines, and A.cross_product(B) is the
expression to be evaluated. Click Evaluate to see the result. You'll have
to work out the correct units for yourself.

 A = vector([2, 4, -1]);
 B = vector([10, 25, 20]);
 A.cross_product(B)

Try changing the third line to B.cross_product(A). What changes?

Equilibrium of Particles

3.1 Equilibrium

Engineering statics is the study of rigid bodies in equilibrium so it's appropri-

ate to begin by defining what we mean by rigid bodies and what we mean by

equilibrium.

A body is an object, possibly made up of many parts, which may be ex-

amined as a unit. In statics, we consider the forces acting on the object as a

whole and also examine it in greater detail by studying each of its parts, which

are bodies in their own right. The choice of the body is an engineering decision

based on what we are interested in finding out. We might, for example, consider

an entire high-rise building as a body for the purpose of designing the building's

foundation, and later consider each column and beam of the structure to ensure

that they are strong enough to perform their individual roles.

A rigid body is a body that doesn't deform under load, that is to say, an

object which doesn't bend, stretch, or twist when forces are applied to it. It

is an idealization or approximation because no objects in the real world behave

this way; however, this simplification still produces valuable information. You

will drop the rigid body assumption and study deformation, stress, and strain

in a later course called Strength of Materials or Mechanics of Materials. In that

course, you will perform analysis of non-rigid bodies, but each problem you do

there will begin with the rigid body analysis you will learn to do here.

A body in equilibrium is not accelerating. As you learned in physics, ac-

celeration is velocity's time rate of change and is a vector quantity. For linear

motion,          a = dv.
                       dt

For an object in equilibrium a = 0 which implies that the body is either

stationary or moving with a constant velocity

                 a = 0 =  v=0
                          v = C.

                 77
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  78

    The acceleration of an object is related to the net force acting on it by
Newton's Second Law

                                             F = ma.

    So for the special case of static equilibrium Newton's Law becomes

F = 0.                               (3.1.1)

    This simple equation is one of the two foundations of engineering statics.
    There are several ways to think about this equation. Reading it from left to
right it says that if all the forces acting on a body sum to zero, then the body
will be in equilibrium. If you read it from right to left it says that if a body is
in equilibrium, then all the forces acting on the body must sum to zero. Both
interpretations are equally valid but we will be using the second one more often.
In a typical problem equilibrium of a body implies that the forces sum to zero,
and we use that fact to find the unknown forces which make it so. Remember
that we are talking about vector addition here, so the sums of the forces must
be calculated using the rules of vector addition; you won't get correct answers if
you can't add vectors!
    We'll be using all of the different vector addition techniques introduced in
Section 2.6, which may lead to some confusion. It doesn't matter, mathemati-
cally, which technique you use but part of the challenge and reward of statics is
learning to select the best tool for the job at hand; to select the simplest, easiest,
fastest, or clearest way to get to the solution. You'll do best in this course if you
can use multiple approaches to solve the same problem.
    In Chapter 5 we will add another requirement for equilibrium, namely equi-
librium equation (5.3.2) which says the forces which cause rotational motion
and angular acceleration  also must sum to zero, but for the problems of this
chapter the only condition we'll need for equilibrium is F = 0.

3.2 Particles

We'll begin our study of Equilibrium with the simplest possible object in the
simplest possible situation -- a particle in a one-dimensional coordinate
system. Also, in this chapter and the next all forces will be represented as
concentrated forces. In later sections, we will address more complicated situ-
ations, higher dimensions, and distributed forces, but beginning with very simple
situations will help you to develop engineering sense and problem-solving skills
which will be useful later.

    The defining characteristic of a particle is that all forces that act on it are
coincident1 or concurrent2, not that it is small. Forces are coincident if they have
the same line of action, and concurrent if they intersect at a point. The moon,
earth and sun can all be treated as particles, but we probably won't encounter

    1Two lines are coincident when one lies on top of the other.
    2Two or more lines are concurrent if they intersect at a single point.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  79

them in statics since they're not in equilibrium. Forces are coincident/concurrent
if their lines of action all intersect at a single, common point. Two or more
forces are also considered concurrent if they share the same line of action. One
practical consequence of this is that particles are never subjected to forces that
cause rotation. So a see-saw, for example, is not a particle because the weights
of the children tend 3 to cause rotation.

    Another consequence of concurrent forces is that Equation (3.1.1) is the only
equilibrium equation that applies. This vector equation can be used to solve for
a maximum of one unknown per dimension. If you find yourself trying to solve
a two-dimensional particle equilibrium problem and you are seeking more than
two unknowns, it's likely that you have missed something and need to re-read
the question.

    Another simplification we will be making is to treat all forces as concen-
trated. Concentrated forces act at a single point, have a well-defined line of
action, and can be represented with an arrow -- in other words, they are vectors.
Real forces don't actually act at a single mathematical point but concentrating
them is intuitive and will be justified in a later chapter 7.8. You're already fa-
miliar with the concept if you have ever placed all the weight of an object at its
center of gravity.

3.3 1D Particle Equilibrium

3.3.1 A simple case

Consider the weight suspended by a rope shown in Figure 3.3.1. Diagrams of
this type are called space diagrams; they show the objects as they exist in
space.

    In mechanics we are interested in studying the forces acting on objects and in
this course, the objects will be in equilibrium. The best way to do this is to draw
a diagram that focuses on the forces acting on the object, not the mechanisms
that hold it in place. We call this type of diagram a free-body diagram because
it shows the object disconnected or freed from its supporting mechanisms. You
can see the free-body diagram for this situation by moving the slider in the
interactive to position two. This shows that there are two forces acting on the
object; the force of the rope holding it up, and the weight of the object which is
trying to pull it to earth, which we treat as acting at its center of gravity.

    3We say "tend to cause rotation" because in a static's context, all objects are static -- so
no actual rotation occurs.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                          80

    The actual shape of the weight is                  W
not important to us, so it can sim-
ply be represented with a dot, as            Space Diagram
shown when the view control is in
position three. The forces have been              Live
slid along their common line of ac-           Link
tion until they both act on the dot,    Figure 3.3.1 A suspended weight
which is an example of an equivalent
transformation called the "Principle
of Transmissibility." This diagram
in view three is completely sufficient
for this situation.

    Drawing free-body diagrams can be surprisingly tricky. The reason for this is
that you must identify all the forces acting on the object and correctly represent
them on the free-body diagram. If you fail to account for all the forces, include
additional ones, or represent them incorrectly, your analysis will surely be wrong.

    So what kind of analysis can we do here? Admittedly not much. We can
find the tension in the rope caused by a particular weight and use it to select an
appropriately strong rope, or we can determine the maximum weight a particular
rope can safely support.

    The actual analysis is so trivial that you've probably already done it in your
head, nevertheless several ways to approach it will be shown next.

    In the vector approach we will use the equation of equilibrium.

Example 3.3.2 1D Vector Addition.

Find the relationship between the tension in the rope and the suspended
weight for the system of Figure 3.3.1.

Solution.

    The free-body diagram shows two forces acting on
the particle, and since the particle is in equilibrium they
must add to zero.

                               F = 0

                           T+W=0

                                 T = -W

We conclude that force T is equal and opposite to W, that is, since the
weight is acting down, the rope acts with the same magnitude but up.
Tension is the magnitude of the rope's force. Recall that the magnitude
of a vector is always a positive scalar. We use normal (non-bold) typefaces
or absolute value bars surrounding a vector to indicate its magnitude. For
any force F,

                                          F = |F|.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                       81

To find how the tension is related to W, take the absolute value of both
sides

                                           |T| = | - W|
                                             T =W

    We can also formulate this example in terms of unit vectors. Recall that
j is the unit vector that points up. It has a magnitude of one with no units
associated. So in terms of unit vector j, T = T j and W = -W j.

   Example 3.3.3 1D Vector Addition using unit vectors.

   Find the relation between the tension T and weight W for the system of
   Figure 3.3.1 using unit vectors.

   Solution.
        Express the forces in terms of their magnitudes and

   the unit vector j then proceed as before,

                                       F = 0
                                  T+W=0
                            T j + W (-j) = 0

                                        T j££ = W j££
                                         T =W

    In the previous example, the unit vector j completely dropped out of the
equation leaving only the coefficients of j. This will be the case whenever you
add vectors which all act along the same line of action.

    The coefficients of i, j, and k are known as the scalar components. A scalar
component times the associated unit vector is a force vector.

    When you use scalar components, the forces are represented by scalar values
and the equilibrium equations are solved using normal algebraic addition rather
than vector addition. This leads to a slight simplification of the solution as
shown in the next example.

   Example 3.3.4 1D Vector Addition using scalar components.

   Find the relation between the tension T and weight W for the system of
   Figure 3.3.1 using scalar components.

   Solution.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                  82

    The forces in this problem are W = -W j and T =
T j, so the corresponding scalar components are

Wy = -W  Ty = T

.
    Adding scalar components gives,

                                Fy = 0
                           Wy + Ty = 0
                          -W + T = 0

                                    T =W

Unsurprisingly, we get the same result.

3.3.2 Scalar Components

The scalar component of a vector is a signed number which indicates the vector's
magnitude and sense, and is usually identified by a symbol with a subscript
which indicates the line of action of the vector.

     So for example, Fx = 10 N is a scalar component. We can tell it's not a
vector because it Fx is not bold. 10 N is the magnitude of the associated vector;
the subscript x indicates that the force acts "in the x direction," in other words
it acts on a line of action which is parallel to the x axis; and the (implied)
positive sign means that the vector points towards the positive end of the x axis
-- towards positive infinity. So a scalar component, while not a vector, contains
all the information necessary to completely describe and draw the corresponding
vector. Be careful not to confuse scalar components with vector magnitudes. A
force with a magnitude of 10 N can point in any direction, but can never have a
negative magnitude.

     Scalar components can be added together algebraically, but only if they act
"in the same direction." It makes no sense to add Fx to Fy. If that's what you
want to do, first you must convert the scalar components to vectors, then add
them according to the rules of vector addition.

    Example 3.3.5 1D Scalar Addition.

    If Ax = 10 lb and Bx = -15 lb, find the magnitude and direction of their
    resultant R.

    Solution. Start by sketching the two forces. The subscripts indicate the
    line of action of the force, and the sign indicates the direction along the
    line of action. A negative Bx points towards the negative end of the x
    axis.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                              83

      R = Ax + Bx
         = 10 lb + -15 lb
         = -5 lb

R is the scalar component of the resultant R.
The negative sign on the result indicates that the resultant force acts to
the left.

Example 3.3.6 2D Scalar Addition.

If Fx = -40 N and Fy = 30 N, find the magnitude and direction of their
resultant F.

Solution. In this example the scalar components have different sub-
scripts indicating that they act along different lines of action, and this
must be accounted for when they are added together.
Make a sketch of the two vectors and add them using the parallelogram
rule. In this case, the parallelogram is a rectangle, so right-triangle trig is
appropriate.

F=  F2     +  F2

      x         y

= (-40 N)2 + (30 N)2
= 50 N

 = tan-1   Fy
  = tan-1  Fx
  = 36.9    30 N
           -40 N

 is measured from the negative x axis. The direction of F from the positive
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                  84

x axis is (180 - ) = 143.1, so
                                  F = 50 N at 143.1

3.3.3 Two-force Bodies

As you might expect from the name, a two-force body is a body with two
forces acting on it, like the weight just discussed. As we just saw, in order for a
two-force body to be in equilibrium the two forces must add to zero. There are
only three possible ways that this can happen:

    The two forces must either

   · share the same line of action, have the same magnitude, and point away
       from each other, or

   · share the same line of action, have the same magnitude, and point towards
       each other, or

   · both forces have zero magnitude.

    When two forces have the same magnitude but act in diametrically opposite
directions, we say that they are equal-and-opposite. When equal and opposite
forces act on an object and they point towards each other we say that the object
is in compression, when they point away from each other the object is in
tension. Tension and compression describe the internal state of the object.

Figure 3.3.7 Examples of two-force bodies

    Did you notice that last three examples in Figure 3.3.7 did not include the
object's weight? These are simplifictions that ignore the object's weight to make
them two-force bodies. If the object's weight was included, it would be a three-
force body. This approximation is justifiable when the object's weight is small
in comparison with the tensile or compressive forces. In this case, we say that
the weight is negligable, i.e. small enough to neglect. Also note that all these
examples show single forces acting at each point. If several forces act at a point,
they should be combined into a single resultant force acting there.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  85

    Two force bodies appear frequently in multipart structures and machines
which will be covered in Chapter 6. Some examples of two force bodies are
struts and linkages, ropes, cables and guy wires, and springs.

   Thinking Deeper 3.3.8 Locating the Center of Gravity.

   As we will see in Chapter 7, the center of gravity is the point where all
    the weight of an object can be considered to be concentrated.
   An object suspended by a cable or a frictionless pin is a two-force body.
   When hung freely it will naturally rotate until its center of gravity lies
    directly beneath the support point to ensure that the lifting force and the
   weight share the same line of action. This means that the center of gravity
    of an object can be found by suspending it from several different points,
    and noting intersection of lines drawn straight down from the hook (like
    a plumb bob).
    In practical terms, to safely lift a heavy object with a chain fall or crane,
   you must always ensure that the hook is directly above the center of gravity
    before hoisting the load. The load will be unstable if lifted from any other
    point.

Example 3.3.9 Tug of War.

Marines and Airmen at Goodfellow Air Force Base are competing in a tug
of war and have reached a stalemate. The Marines are pulling with a force
of 1500 lb. How hard are the Airmen pulling? What is the tension in the
rope?

This is a simple question, but students often get it wrong at first.
Solution.

   1. Assumptions.
       A free-body diagram of the rope is shown.

       Figure 3.3.10
       We'll solve this with scalar components because there's no need for
       the additional complexity of the vector approaches in this simple
       situation.
       We'll align the x axis with the rope with positive to the right as
       usual to establish a coordinate system.
       Assume that the pull of each team can be represented by a single
       force. Let force M be supplied by the Marines and force A by the
       Airmen; call the tension in the rope T .
       Assume that the weight of the rope is negligible; then the rope can
       be considered a particle because both forces lie along same line of
       action.

   2. Givens.
       M = 1500 lb.

   3. Procedure.
       Since they're stalemated we know that the rope is in equilibrium.
       Applying the equation of equilibrium gives:
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                       88

                                     Fx = 0
                               -M + A = 0

                                        A=M
                                           = 1500 lb

We find out that both teams pull with the same force. This was
probably obvious without drawing the free-body diagram or solving
the equilibrium equation.

It may seem equally obvious that if both teams are pulling with
1500 lb in opposite directions that the tension in the rope must be
3000 lb. This is wrong however.

The tension in the rope T is an example of an internal force and
in order to learn its magnitude we need a free-body diagram which
includes force T . To expose the internal force we take an imaginary
cut through the rope and draw (or imagine) a free-body diagram of
either half of the rope.

       Figure 3.3.11
       The correct answer is easily seen to be T = A = M = 1500 lb.

Example 3.3.12 Hanging Weight.

    The wire spool being lifted into the
truck consists of 750 m of three strand
medium voltage (5 kV) 1/0 AWG electri-
cal power cable with a 195 amp capacity
at 90°C, weighing 927 kg/km, on a 350 kg
steel reel.

    How much weight is supported by the
hook and high tension polymer lifting
sling?

Solution. The entire weight of the wire and the spool is supported by
the hook and sling.
Remember that weight is not mass and mass is not force. The total weight
is found by multiplying the total mass by the gravitational constant g.

                     W = mg
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                            89

                         = (mw + ms) g
                         = ((0.75 km)(927 kg/km) + 350 kg) g
                         = (1045 kg)(9.81 m/s2)
                         = 10300 N

Question 3.3.13

How can we apply the principles of mechanics in the two previous examples
if the rope and the sling are clearly not "rigid bodies?"
Answer. They are not rigid, but they are inextensible and in tension.
Under these conditions they don't change shape, so we can treat them as
rigid. If the force were to change direction and put either into compression,
our assumptions and analysis would fail. That is why "tug of war" involves
pulling and not pushing.

3.3.4 General Procedure

The general procedure for solving one, two, or three-dimensional particle equilib-
rium problems is essentially the same. Start with the 5-step method for creating
a free-body diagram and solve for your unknowns using your equilibrium equa-
tions.

    Draw a Free-Body Diagram

   1. Select and isolate the particle. The "free-body" in free-body diagram means
       that a concurrent force particle or connection must be isolated from the
       supports physically holding it in place. This means creating a separate
       free-body diagram from your problem sketch.

   2. Establish a coordinate system. This step is simple for one-dimensional
       problems: just label a positive direction for the forces.

   3. Identify all loads. Include force vectors on your free-body diagram repre-
       senting each applied load pushing or pulling the body, in addition to the
       body's weight, if it is non-negligible. Every vector should have a descriptive
       variable name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.

   4. Identify all reactions. Reactions represent the resistance of the physical
       supports you cut away by isolating the body in step 1. All particle supports
       are two-force members that result in tension or compression forces. Label
       each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead.

   5. Label the diagram. Verify that every force is labeled with either a value
       or a symbolic name if the value is unknown. Your final free-body diagram
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  90

   should be a stand-alone presentation and is the basis of your equilibrium
   equations.

Create and Solve Equilibrium Equations

1. Write the equilibrium equation. Now represent your free-body diagram as
   an equilibrium equation. Your computation should start with the govern-
   ing equation, like F = 0.

2. Solve for unknown. Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equation and
   solve for the unknown value. Write the unit of your answer. All answers in
   engineering have units unless you prove that they don't. Finally, underline
   or box your answers.

3. Check your work. Do the results seem reasonable given the situation?
   Have you included appropriate units?

3.4 2D Particle Equilibrium

3.4.1 Introduction

In this section we will study situations where everything of importance occurs
in a two-dimensional plane and the third dimension is not involved. Studying
two-dimensional problems is worthwhile because they illustrate all the important
principles of engineering statics while being easier to visualize and less mathe-
matically complex.

    We will normally work in the "plane of the page," that is, a two-dimensional
Cartesian plane with a horizontal x axis and a vertical y axis discussed in Sec-
tion 2.3 previously. This coordinate system can represent either the front, side,
or top view of a system as appropriate. In some problems it may be worthwhile
to rotate the coordinate system, that is, to establish a coordinate system
where the x and y axes are not horizontal and vertical. This is usually done to
simplify the mathematics by avoiding simultaneous equations.

3.4.2 General Procedure

The general procedure for solving two-dimensional particle equilibrium is a step
up from solving Subsection 3.3.1, as you now need to find equilibrium in two
independent directions. The major difference is that you must carefully find
each independent vector component and then solve for the equilibrium in each
component direction. The process follows the same five-step method for creating
a free-body diagram, followed by steps to solve your equilibrium equations.

    Draw a Free-Body Diagram:
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  91

1. Select and isolate the particle. The "free-body" in free-body diagram means
   that a concurrent force particle or connection must be isolated from the
   supports that are physically holding it in place. This means creating a
   separate free-body diagram from your problem sketch.

2. Establish a coordinate system. Draw a right-handed coordinate system to
   use as a reference for your equilibrium equations. Look ahead and select a
   coordinate system that minimizes the number of force components. This
   will simplify your vector algebra. The choice is technically arbitrary, but
   a good choice will simplify your calculations and reduce your effort.

3. Identify all loads. Add force vectors to your free-body diagram representing
   each applied load pushing or pulling the body, in addition to the body's
   weight, if it is non-negligible. If a force vector has a known direction, draw
   it. If its direction is unknown, assume one, and your later algebra will
   check your assumption. Every vector should have a descriptive variable
   name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.

4. Identify all reactions. Reactions represent the resistance of the physical
   supports you cut away by isolating the body in step 1. All particle supports
   are some type of two-force members with tension or compression reaction
   forces. These reactions will all be concurrent with the body loads from
   Step 2. Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear
   arrowhead. Again, if a vector's direction is unknown, just assume one.

5. Label the diagram. Verify that every dimension, angle, force, and moment
   is labeled with either a value or a symbolic name if the value is unknown.
   In our eyes, dimensioning is optional. Having the information needed
   for your calculations is helpful, but don't clutter the diagram up with
   unneeded details. Your final free-body diagram should be a stand-alone
   presentation and is the basis of your equilibrium equations.

Create and Solve Equilibrium Equations

1. Break vectors into components. Compute each force's x and y components
   using right-triangle trigonometry.

2. Write equilibrium equations. Now represent your free-body diagram as two
   equilibrium equations, Fx = 0 and Fy = 0.

3. Count knowns and unknowns. At this point, you should have at most two
   unknown values. If you have more than two, reread the problem and look
   for overlooked information.

4. Solve for unknowns. Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equations
   and solve for unknowns. All answers in Statics will have units - unless you
   have solved for a dimensionless value, like a friction coefficient. Finally,
   underline or box your answers.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  92

5. Check your work. If you add the components of the forces, do they add
   to zero? Do the results seem reasonable given the situation? Have you
   included appropriate units?

3.4.3 Force Triangle Method

The force triangle method applies to situations where there are (exactly) three
forces acting on a particle, and no more than two unknown magnitudes or direc-
tions.

    If such a particle is in equilibrium then the three forces must add to zero.
Graphically, if you arrange the force vectors tip-to-tail, they will form a closed,
three-sided polygon, i.e. a triangle. This is illustrated in Figure 3.4.1.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  93

                Live Link

Figure 3.4.1 Free-Body Diagram and Force Triangle
    Question 3.4.2
   Why do the forces always form a closed polygon?
   Answer. Because their resultant is zero.
    The force triangle is a graphical representation of the vector equilibrium equa-

tion (3.1.1). It can be used to solve for unknown values in multiple different ways,
which will be illustrated in the next two examples. In Example 3.4.3 We will use
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                             94

a graphical approach to find the forces causing equilibrium, and in Example 3.4.4
we will use trigonometry to solve for the unknown forces mathematically.

    In the next example we will use technology to draw a scaled diagram of the
force triangle representing the equilibrium situation. We are using Geogebra to
make the drawing, but you could use CAD, another drawing program, or even
a ruler and protractor as you prefer. Since the diagram is accurately drawn, the
lengths and angles represent the magnitudes and directions of the forces which
hold the particle in equilibrium.

    Example 3.4.3 Frictionless Incline.

    A force P is being applied to a
100 lb block resting on a frictionless
incline as shown. Determine the mag-
nitude and direction of force P and
of the contact force on the bottom of
the block.

Solution.

   1. Assumptions.

       We must assume that the block is in equilibrium, that is, either
       motionless or moving at a constant velocity in order to use the equi-
       librium equations. We will represent the block's weight and the force
       between the incline and the block as concentrated forces. The force
       of the inclined surface on the block must act in a direction that is
       normal to the surface since it is frictionless and can't prevent motion
       along the surface.

   2. Givens.

       The knowns here are the weight of the block, the direction of the
       applied force, and the slope of the incline. The slope of the incline
       provides the direction of the normal force.

       The unknown values are the magnitudes of forces P and N .

   3. Free-Body Diagram.

       You should always begin a statics problem by drawing a free-body
       diagram. It allows you to think about the situation, identify knowns
       and unknowns, and define symbols.

       We define three symbols, W , N , and P , representing the weight,
       normal force, and applied force respectively. The angles could be
       given symbols too, but since we know their values it isn't necessary.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                               95

                                                 The free-body can be a quick
                                             sketch or an accurate drawing but
                                             it must show all the forces acting
                                             on the particle and define the sym-
                                             bols. In most cases, you won't
                                             know the magnitudes of all the
                                             forces, so the lengths of the vec-
                                             tors are just approximate.

   Notice that the force N is represented as acting 25° from the y axis,
   which is 90° away from the direction of the surface.

4. Force Triangle.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  96

                  Live Link

   Use the known information to carefully and accurately construct the
   force triangle.

     (a) Start by placing point A at the origin.
     (b) Draw force W straight down from A with a length of 1, and

          place point B at its tip. The length of this vector represents
          the weight.
     (c) We know the direction of force P but not its magnitude. For
          now, just draw line BC passing through point B with an angle
          of 10° from the horizontal.
     (d) Similarly we know force N acts at 25° from vertical because it
          is perpendicular to the inclined surface, and it will close the
          triangle. So draw line CA passing through point A and at a
          25° angle from the y axis.
     (e) Call the point where lines BC and CA intersect point C. Points
          A, B, and C define the force triangle.
     (f) Now draw force P from point B to point C, and
     (g) Draw force N from point C back to point A.

    Can you prove from the geometry of the triangle that angle BCA
   is 75°?
5. Results.
   In steps 6 and 7, Geogebra tells us that p = (0.438;10.0°) which
   means force P is 0.438 units long with a direction of 10°, similarly
   n = (1.02;115°) means N is 1.02 units long at 115°. These angles
   are measured counter-clockwise from the positive x axis.
   These are not the answers we are looking for, but we're close. Re-
   member that for this diagram, our scale is

                                    1 unit = 100 lbs,

   so scaling the lengths of p and n by this factor gives

                           P = (0.438 unit)(100 lb/ unit)
                               = 43.8 lb at 10°

                           N = (1.02 unit)(100 lb/ unit)
                               = 102 lb at 115°
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                    98

.

If you use technology such as Geogebra, as we did here, or CAD
software to draw the force triangle, it will accurately produce the
solution.

If technology isn't available to you, such as during an exam, you can
still use a ruler and protractor to draw the force triangle, but your
results will only be as accurate as your diagram. In the best case,
using a sharp pencil and carefully measuring lengths and angles, you
can only expect about two significant digits of accuracy from a hand-
drawn triangle. Nevertheless, even a roughly drawn triangle can give
you an idea of the correct answers and be used to check your work
after you use another method to solve the problem.

3.4.4 Trigonometric Method

The general approach for solving particle equilibrium problems using the trigono-
metric method is to:

   1. Draw and label a free-body diagram.

   2. Rearrange the forces into a force triangle and label it.

   3. Identify the knowns and unknowns.

   4. Use trigonometry to find the unknown sides or angles of the triangle.

    There must be no more than two unknowns to use this method, which may
be either magnitudes or directions. During the problem setup, you will probably
need to use the geometry of the situation to find one or more angles.

    If the force triangle has a right angle you can use Section B.2 to find the
unknown values, but in most cases, the triangle will be oblique and you will
need to use either or both of the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines to find the
sides or angles.

    Example 3.4.4 Cargo Boom.

        A 24 kN crate is being lowered
   into the cargo hold of a ship. Boom
   AB is 20 m long and acts at a 40°
   angle from kingpost AC. The boom
   is held in this position by topping lift
   BC which has a 1:4 slope.

        Determine the forces in the boom
   and in the topping lift.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                            99

Solution.

   1. Draw diagrams.

       Start by identifying the particle and drawing a free-body diagram.
       The particle in this case is point B at the end of the boom because
       it is the point where all three forces intersect. Let T be the tension
       of the topping lift, C be the force in the boom, and W be the weight
       of the load. Let  and  be the angles that forces T and C make
       with the horizontal.

       Rearrange the forces acting on point B to form a force triangle as
       was done in the previous example.

2. Find angles.
   Angle  can be found from the slope of the topping lift.

                                = tan-1 1 = 14.0°.
                                                4

   Angle  is the complement of the 40° angle the boom makes with

                                   = 90° - 40° = 50°
   Use these values to find the three angles in the force triangle.

                                  1 =  +  = 64.0°
                                  2 = 90° -  = 76.0°
                                  3 = 90° -  = 40.0°

3.4.5 Scalar Components Method

The general statement of equilibrium of forces, (3.1.1), can be expressed as the
sum of forces in the i, j and k directions

          F = Fx i + Fy j + Fz k = 0.                                (3.4.1)

This statement will only be true if all three coefficients of the unit vectors are

themselves equal to zero, leading to this scalar interpretation of the equilibrium

equation           
                   Fx = 0

          F = 0 = Fy = 0                 (three dimensions).         (3.4.2)
                              Fz = 0

    In other words, the single vector equilibrium equation is equivalent to three
independent scalar equations, one for each coordinate direction.

    In two-dimensional situations, no forces act in the k direction leaving just
these two equilibrium equations to be satisfied

          F = 0 =       Fx = 0           (two-dimensions).           (3.4.3)
                        Fy = 0

We will use this equation as the basis for solving two-dimensional particle equi-
librium problems in this section and equation (3.4.2) for three-dimensional prob-
lems in Section 3.5.

    You are undoubtedly familiar with utility poles, which carry electric, cable
and telephone lines, but have you ever noticed as you drive down a winding road
that the poles will switch from one side of the road to the other and back again?
Why is this?

    If you consider the forces acting on the top of a pole beside a curving sec-
tion of road you'll observe that the tensions of the cables produce a net force
towards the road. This force is typically opposed by a " guy wire " pulling in the
opposite direction which prevents the pole from tipping over due to unbalanced
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  101

forces. The power company tries to keep poles beside road segments with convex
curvature. If they didn't switch sides, the guy wire for poles at concave curves
would extend into the road... which is a poor design.

    Example 3.4.5 Utility Pole.

    Consider the utility pole next to the road shown below. A top view is
    shown in the right-hand diagram. If each of the six power lines pulls with
    a force of 10.0 kN, determine the magnitude of the tension in the guy wire.

Solution.

   1. Assumptions.

       A utility pole isn't two-dimensional, but we can solve this problem
       as if it was by first considering the force components acting in a
       horizontal plane, and then considering the components in a vertical
       plane.

       It also isn't a concurrent force problem because the lines of action of
       the forces don't all intersect at a single point. However, we can make
       it into one by replacing the forces of the three power lines in each
       direction with a single force three times larger. This is an example
       of an equivalent transformation, a trick engineers use frequently to
       turn complex situations into simpler ones. It works here because all
       the tensions are equal, and the outside wires are equidistant from
       the center wire. You must be careful to justify all equivalent trans-
       formations because they will lead to errors if they are not applied
       correctly. Equivalent transformations will be discussed in greater
       detail in Section 4.6 later.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  102

2. Givens.

   T = 10.0 kN and 38° and 152° angles.

3. Free-Body Diagram.

   Begin by drawing a neat, labeled, free-body diagram of the top view
   of the pole, establishing a coordinate system and indicating the di-
   rections of the forces.

   Call the tension in one power line T and the tension in the guy
   wire G. Resolve the the tension of the guy wire into a horizontal
   component Gh, and a vertical component Gv. Only the horizontal
   component of G is visible in the top view.

   Although it is not necessary, it simplifies this problem considerably
   to note the symmetry and establish the x axis along the axis of
   symmetry.

4. Solution.
   Solve for Gh by applying the equations of equilibrium. The symme-
   try of this problem means that the Fx equation is sufficient.

                                      Fx = 0
                               Gh - 6 Tx = 0

                                        Gh = 6 (T cos 76°)
                                            = 14.5 kN

   Once Gh is determined, the tension of the guy wire G is easily found
   by considering the components of G in the side view. Note that the
   vertical component Gv tends to compress the pole.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  103

                                          Gh/G = sin 38
                                               G = Gh/ sin 38
                                               G = 23.6 kN

   This problem could have also been solved using the force triangle method.
    See Subsection 3.4.3.

    In the next example we look at the conditions of equilibrium by considering
the load and the constraints, rather than taking a global equilibrium approach
which considers both the load and reaction forces.

    Example 3.4.6 Slider.

        Three forces act on a machine part that is free
   to slide along a vertical, frictionless rod. Forces A
   and B have a magnitude of 20 N and force C has
   a magnitude of 30 N. Force B acts  degrees from
   the horizontal, and force C acts at the same angle
   from the vertical.

        Determine the angle  required for equilibrium,
   and the magnitude and direction of the reaction
   force acting on the slider.

    Solution.

       1. Givens.
           We are given magnitudes of forces A = 20 N, B = 20 N, and C =
           30 N. The unknowns are angle  and resultant force R.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  104

2. Procedure.

              Live Link

Since the rod is frictionless, it cannot prevent the slider from mov-
ing vertically. Consequently, the slider will only be in equilibrium
if the resultant of the three load forces is horizontal. Since a hori-
zontal force has no y component, we can establish this equilibrium
condition:

                       Ry = Fy = Ay + By + Cy = 0
Inserting the known values into the equilibrium relation and simpli-
fying gives an equation in terms of unknown angle .

                              Ry = Ay + By + Cy = 0
                            A + B sin  - C cos  = 0
                          20 + 20 sin  - 30 cos  = 0
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  105

                               2 + 2 sin  - 3 cos  = 0

This is a single equation with a single unknown, although it is not
particularly easy to solve with algebra. One approach is described
at socratic.org. An alternate approach is to use technology to graph
the function y(x) = 2 + 2 sin x - 3 cos x. The roots of this equation
correspond to values of  which satisfy the equilibrium condition
above. The root occurring closest to x = 0 will be the answer cor-
responding to our problem, in this case  = 22.62° which you can
verify by plugging it back into the equilibrium equation. Note that
-90° also satisfies this equation, but it is not the solution we are
looking for.

Once  is known, we can find the reaction force by adding the x
components of A, B, and C.

                  Rx = Ax + Bx + Cx
                      = A + B cos  + C sin 
                      = 0 + 20 cos(22.62°) + 30 sin(22.62°)
                      = 30.00 N

The resultant force R is the vector sum of Rx and Ry, but in this
situation Ry is zero, so the resultant acts purely to the right with a
magnitude of Rx.

                                R = 30.00 N  .

Note that this value is the resultant force, i.e. the net force applied
to the slider by A, B, and C. However, the question asks for the
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                              106

           reaction force, which is the force required for equilibrium. The
           reaction is equal and opposite to the resultant.

                                        R = -R = 30.00 N 

    The next example demonstrates how rotating the coordinate system can
simplify the solution. In the first solution, the standard orientation of the x
and y axes is chosen, and in the second the coordinate system is rotated to
align with one of the unknowns, which enables the solution to be found without
solving simultaneous equations.

   Example 3.4.7 Roller.

        A lawn roller which weighs 160 lb is being
   pulled up a 10 slope at a constant velocity.

3.4.6 Multi-Particle Equilibrium

When two or more particles interact with each other there will always be common
forces between them as a result of Newton's Third Law, the action-reaction
principle.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES      108

    Consider the two boxes with                                                                                                                 Simplified FBD
weights W1 and W2 connected to
each other and the ceiling shown in              Live
the interactive diagram. Position            Link
one shows the physical arrangement     Figure 3.4.8 Two suspended weights
of the objects, position two shows
their free-body diagrams, and posi-
tion three shows simplified free-body
diagrams where the objects are rep-
resented by points. The boxes were
freed by replacing the cables with
tension forces TA and TB.

    From the free-body diagrams you can see that cable B only supports the
weight of the bottom box, while cable A and the ceiling support the combined
weight. The tension TB is common to both diagrams. Recognizing the common
force is the key to solving multi-particle equilibrium problems.

Example 3.4.9 Two hanging weights.

A 100 N weight W is sup-

ported by cable ABCD. There

is a frictionless pulley at B and

the hook is firmly attached to the

cable at point C.                      

What is the magnitude and di-

rection of force P required to hold

the system in the position shown?

Hint. The particles are points B and C. The common force is the tension
in rope segment BC.

Solution.

   1. Strategy.

       Following the General Procedure we identify the particles as points
       A and B, and draw free-body diagrams of each. We label the rope
       tensions A, C, and D for the endpoints of the rope segments, and
       label the angles of the forces , , and . We will use the standard
       Cartesian coordinate system and use the scalar components method.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                           109


                           

Weight W was given, and we can easily find angles , , and  so
the knowns are:

W = 100 N                      = 63.4°
  = tan-1 40                   = 7.13°
                               = 45°
                 20
  = tan-1 10

                 80
  = tan-1 50

                 50

   Counting unknowns we find that there are two on the free-body
   diagram of particle C (C and D), but four on particle B, (AC, P
   and ).

   Two unknowns on particle C means it is solvable since there are two
   equilibrium equations available, so we begin there.

2. Solve Particle C.

       Fx = 0                                         Fy = 0
-Cx + Dx = 0                             Cy + Dy - W = 0
                                      C sin  + D sin  = W
    C cos  = D cos 
                       cos 45  C sin 7.13 + D sin 45 = 100 N

          C = D cos 7.13             0.124C + 0.707D = 100 N
          C = 0.713D

Solving these two equations simultaneously gives
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                   110

C = 89.6 N                           D = 125.7 N

   .

   With particle C solved, we can use the results to solve particle B.
   There are three unknowns remaining, tension A, magnitude P , and
   direction . Unfortunately, we still only have two available equilib-
   rium equations. When you find yourself in this situation with more
   unknowns than equations, it generally means that you are missing
   something. In this case, it is the pulley. When a cable wraps around
   a frictionless pulley the tension doesn't change. The missing infor-
   mation is that A = C. Knowing this, the magnitude and direction
   of force P can be determined.

    Because A = C, the free-body diagram of particle B is symmetric,
   and the technique used in Example 3.4.5 to rotate the coordinate
   system could be applied here.

3. Solve Particle B.

   Referring to the fbd for particle B we can write these equations.

              Fx = 0                             Fy = 0
-Ax - Px + Cx = 0                    Ay - Py - Cy = 0

           P cos  = C cos  - A cos            P sin  = A sin  - C sin 

Since A = C = 89.6 N, substituting and solving simultaneously gives

P cos  = 48.8 N                      P sin  = 69.0 N
      P = 84.5 N                            = 54.7

.

These are the magnitude and direction of vector P. If you wish, you
can express P in terms of its scalar components. The negative signs
on the components have been applied by hand since P points down
and to the left.

P = -P cos , -P sin 
  = -48.8 N, -69.0 N

3.5 3D Particle Equilibrium

The world we live in has three dimensions. One and two-dimensional textbook
problems have been useful for learning the principles of engineering mechanics,
but to model real-world problems we will have to consider all three.

    Fortunately, all the principles you have learned so far still apply, but many
students have difficulty visualizing three-dimensional problems drawn on two-
dimensional paper and the mathematics becomes a bit harder. It is especially
important to have good diagrams and keep your work neat and organized to
avoid errors.

3.5.1 Three-Dimensional Coordinate Frame

We need a coordinate frame for three dimensions, just as we did in two dimen-
sions, so we add a third orthogonal axis z to our existing two-dimensional frame.

    For equilibrium of a particle, usually the origin of the coordinate frame is
at the particle, the x axis is horizontal, and the y axis is vertical just as in a
two-dimensional situation. The orientation of the z axis is determined by the
right-hand rule. Using your right hand, put your palm at the origin and point
your fingers along the positive x axis. Then curl your fingers towards the positive
y axis. Your thumb will point in the direction of the positive z axis. For example,
in the plane of the page with the positive x axis horizontal and to the right and
the positive y axis vertical and upwards, the positive z axis will point towards
you out of the page. Remember that the three axes are mutually perpendicular,
i.e. each axis is perpendicular to both of the others. The right-hand rule is
important in many aspects of engineering, so make sure that you understand
how it works. Mistakes will lead to sign errors.

Figure 3.5.1 Point-and-curl right-hand rule technique.

3.5.2 Free-Body Diagrams

As we did before, we begin our analysis by drawing a free-body diagram that
shows all forces and moments acting on the object of interest. Drawing a fbd
in three dimensions can be difficult. It is sometimes hard to see things in three
dimensions when they are drawn on a two-dimensional sheet. Consequently, it
is important to carefully label vectors and angles, but not to clutter up the
diagram with too much and/or unnecessary information. When working in two
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES  112

dimensions, you only need one angle to determine the direction of the vector,
but when working in three dimensions you need two or three angles.

3.5.3 Angles

As stated above, when working in three dimensions you need three angles to
determine the direction of the vector, namely, the angle with respect to the x
axis, the angle with respect to the y axis and the angle with respect to the z
axis. The three angles mentioned above are not necessarily located in any of the
coordinate planes. Think of it this way -- three points determine a plane, and
in this case, the three points are: the origin, the tip of the vector, and a point
on an axis. The plane made by those three points is not necessarily the xy, yz,
or xz plane. It is most likely a "tilted" plane.

    As you learned in Subsection 2.4.2, one way to quantify the direction of a
vector is with direction cosine angles. These direction cosine angles are measured
from the positive x, y, and z axes and are often labeled x, y, and z, respectively.

    As with two dimensions, angles can be determined from geometry -- a dis-
tance vector going in the same direction as the force vector. This is the three-
dimensional equivalent of similar triangles that you used in the two-dimensional
problems.

                Live Link

Figure 3.5.2 Direction Cosine Angles
    If you know that the line of action of a force vector goes between two points,
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                                    113

then you can use the distance vector that goes from one point to the other to
determine the angles.

    Let's suppose that the line of action goes through two points A and B, and
the direction of the force is from A towards B. The first step in determining
the three angles is to write the distance vector from point A towards point B.
Let's call this vector rAB. Starting at point A, you need to determine how to
get to point B by moving in each of the three directions. Ask yourself: to get
from point A to point B do I have to move in the x direction? If so, how far do
I have to travel? This becomes the x component of the vector rAB namely rABx.
Next, to get from point A to point B how far do I move in y direction? This
distance is rABy . Finally, to get from point A to point B how far do I move in
the z-direction? This distance is rABz .

    When writing these scalar components pay attention to which way you move
along the axes. If you travel toward the positive end of an axis, the corresponding
scalar component gets a positive sign. Travel towards the negative end results
in a negative sign. The sign is important.

    Once you have determined the components of the distance vector rAB, you
can determine the total distance from point A to B using the three-dimensional
Pythagorean Theorem

       rAB = (rABx )2 + (rABy )2 + (rABz )2                            (3.5.1)

Lastly, the angles are determined by the direction cosines, namely

       cos x = rABx     cos y = rABy                   cos z = rABz
                   rAB             rAB                            rAB

Since the force vector has the same line of action as the distance vector, by

the three-dimensional version of similar triangles,

       rABx = Fx        rABy = Fy                      rABz = Fz
       rAB F            rAB F                          rAB F

. So,

       Fx = rABx F      Fy = rABy F                    Fz = rABz F
                 rAB              rAB                            rAB

Now, that is a bit of math there, but the important things to remember are:

· You can use three angles to determine the direction of a force in three
   dimensions.

· You can use the geometry to get them from a distance vector that lies
   along the line of action of the force.

    The three direction cosine angles are not mutually independent. From (3.5.1)
you can easily show that

                        cos x2 + cos y2 + cos z2 = 1,                  (3.5.2)

so if you know two direction cosine angles you can find the third from this
relationship.

3.5.4 General Procedure

The general procedure for solving three-dimensional particle equilibrium is essen-
tially the same as for two-dimensional particle equilibrium using the components
method. The major differences are that you must carefully find each vector com-
ponent using the techniques from Section 2.4. The process follows the same
five-step method for creating a free-body diagram, followed by steps to solve
your equilibrium equations.

    Draw a Free-body Diagram:

   1. Select and isolate the particle. The "free-body" in free-body diagram means
       that a concurrent force particle or connection must be isolated from the
       supports that are physically holding it in place. This means creating a
       separate free-body diagram from your problem sketch.

   2. Establish a coordinate system. Draw a right-handed coordinate system to
       use as a reference for your equilibrium equations. Look ahead and select a
       coordinate system that minimizes the number of force components. This
       will simplify your vector algebra. The choice is technically arbitrary, but
       a good choice will simplify your calculations and reduce your effort.

   3. Identify all loads. Add force vectors to your free-body diagram representing
       each applied load pushing or pulling the body, in addition to the body's
       weight, if it is non-negligible. If a force vector has a known direction, draw
       it. If its direction is unknown, assume one, and your later algebra will
       check your assumption. Every vector should have a descriptive variable
       name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.

   4. Identify all reactions. Reactions represent the resistance of the physical
       supports you cut away by isolating the body in step 1. All particle supports
       are some type of two-force members with tension or compression reaction
       forces. These reactions will all be concurrent with the body loads from
       Step 2. Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear
       arrowhead. Again, if a vector's direction is unknown, just assume one.

   5. Label the diagram. Verify that every dimension, angle, force, and moment
       is labeled with either a value or a symbolic name if the value is unknown.
       In our eyes, dimensioning is optional. Having the information needed
       for your calculations is helpful, but don't clutter the diagram up with
       unneeded details. Your final free-body diagram should be a stand-alone
       presentation and is the basis of your equilibrium equations.

    Create and Solve Equilibrium Equations

   1. Break vectors into components. Compute each force's x, y, and z com-
       ponents using the tools outlined in Section 2.4. While the components in
       two-dimensional problems can often be found with right triangle trigonom-
       etry, three-dimensional problems often use unit vectors.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                               115

2. Write equilibrium equations. Now represent your free-body diagram as
   equilibrium equations. For a three-dimensional particle equilibrium prob-
   lem, you can have up to three force equilibrium equations corresponding
   to a force balance in the three independent x, y, and z directions. Each
   equation should start with the governing equation, like Fx = 0.

3. Count knowns and unknowns. At this point, you should have at most three
   unknowns remaining. If you have over three, reread the problem and look
   for overlooked information.

4. Solve for unknowns. Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equations and
   solve for unknowns. With multiple unknowns scattered across multiple
   equations, linear algebra may be more efficient than substitution. Assume
   that all answers have units - unless you prove that they don't. Finally,
   underline or box your answers.

5. Check your work. If you add the components of the forces, do they add
   to zero? Do the results seem reasonable given the situation? Have you
   included appropriate units?

Now let's see how that process looks on an example problem.

Example 3.5.3 Balloon.

    A hot air balloon 30 ft above the           D
ground is tethered by three cables as
shown in the diagram.                                      30 ft

    If the balloon is pulling upwards        A          C
with a force of 900 lb, what is the    z        Bx
tension in each of the three cables?

    The grid lines on the ground
plane are spaced 10 ft apart.

Solution.
   1. Strategy.
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                        116

The three tensions are the un-

knowns which we can find by ap-

plying the three equilibrium equa-

tions.

We'll establish a coordinate

system with the origin directly be-

low the balloon and the y axis ver-

tical, then draw and label a free-

body diagram.                        z                  x

Next we'll use the given infor-

mation to find two points on each

line of action to find the compo-

nents of each force in terms of the

unknowns.

When the x, y and z components of all forces can be expressed in
terms of known values, the equilibrium equations can be solved.

2. Geometry.
   From the diagram, the coordinates of the points are

  A = (-20, 0, 0) B = (30, 0, 20) C = (0, 0, -20) D = (0, 30, 0)

Use the point coordinates to find the x, y and z components of the
forces.

        Ax = -20 A  Ay = -30 A                  0
                LA          LA          Az = LA A
                30
                    By = -30 B                  20
        Bx = LB B           LB          Bz = LB B
                 0                      Cz = -20 C
                    Cy = -30 C
        Cx = LC C           LC                  LC

Where LA, LB and LC are the lengths of the three cables found with
the distance formula.

        LA =   (-20)2 + (-30)2 + 02     = 36.1 ft
        LB =   302 + (-30)2 + 202       = 46.9 ft
        LC =   02 + (-30)2 + (-20)2     = 36.1 ft

3. Equilibrium Equations.

   Applying the three equations of equilibrium yields three equations
   in terms of the three unknown tensions.

Fx = 0

Ax + Bx + Cx = 0

- 36.1 A + 46.9 B + 0 C = 0

A = 1.153 B                                       (1)

Fz = 0

Az + Bz + Cz = 0

        20       20
0 A + 46.9 B - 36.1 C = 0

C = 0.769 B                                       (2)

Fy = 0

Ay + By + Cy + D = 0

30           30      30
- 36.1 A - 46.9 B - 36.1 C + 900 = 0

0.832 A + 0.640 B + 0.832 C = 900 lb              (3)

Solving these equations simultaneously yields the answers we are
seeking. One way to do this is to substitute equations (1) and (2)
into (3) to eliminate A and C and solve the resulting equation for
B.

          0.832 (1.153 B) + 0.640 B + 0.832 (0.769 B) = 900 lb
                                                          2.24B = 900 lb
                                                               B = 402 lb

With B known, substitute it into equations (1) and (2) to find A
and C.

A = 1.153 B                          C = 0.769 B
   = 464 lb                             = 309 lb

    The skycam at Stanford Univer-
sity Stadium has a mass of 20 kg
and is supported by three cables
as shown. Assuming that it is cur-
rently in equilibrium, find the ten-

Solution. In this situation, the directions of all four forces are specified
by the angles in the free-body diagram, and the magnitude of the weight
CHAPTER 3. EQUILIBRIUM OF PARTICLES                             119

is known. The three unknowns are the magnitudes of forces A, B, and C.

       W = mg = 20 kg 9.81 m/s2 = 196.2 N

We will first find unit vectors in the directions of the four forces by in-
spection of the free-body diagram. This step requires visualizing the com-
ponent's unit vectors and determining the angles each makes with the
coordinate axis.

       W^ = 0, -1, 0
       A^ = cos 35, cos 55, 0
       B^ = - cos 15 cos 30, cos 75, - cos 15 cos 60
       C^ = 0, cos 70, cos 20

Particle equilibrium requires that F = 0.

                    A A^ + B B^ + C C^ = -W W^

This is a 3 × 3 system of three simultaneous equations, one for each
coordinate direction, which needs to be solved for A, B, and C.

       A cos 35 - B cos 15 cos 30 + 0 = 0             (Fx = 0)
       A cos 55 + B cos 75 + C cos 70 = 196.2 N       (Fy = 0)
       0 - B cos 15 cos 60 + C cos 20 = 0             (Fz = 0)

These can be solved by any method you choose. Here we will use Sage.

Evaluating the coefficients and expressing the equations in matrix form

gives                                               
         0.819 -0.837

       0 -0.482 0.940 C                          0

This is an equation in the form

                       [A][x] = [B].

Entering the coefficient matrices into Sage.

   A = Matrix([[0.819,-0.837,0],[0.574,0.259,
        0.342] ,[0 , -0.482 ,0.940]])

   B = vector([0, 196.2, 0])

   x

 (196.391530042156, 192.168056277808, 98.5372373679827)

After evaluating, we learn that

       A = 196.4 N     B = 192.2 N               C = 98.5 N

Moments and Static Equivalence

When a force acts on a body, it can potentially produce two effects: translation
of the body in the direction of the force, and rotation of the body about an
axis. For a body in equilibrium, we say that forces have a tendency to produce
translation or rotation since no actual acceleration or motion occurs.

    The rotational tendency of a force is the subject of this chapter. Engineers
refer to this rotational tendency as a moment, short for "moment of a force."
You may remember using the term torque for the same quantity in physics.
Physicists use torque specifically for the moment of a force, and moment for the
product of any physical quantity with distance. To an engineer, a torque refers
specifically to a moment about the long axis of an object that produces twisting
and torsional stresses.

    A wrench provides a familiar example. A force F applied to the handle
of a wrench, as shown in Figure 4.0.1, creates a moment MA about an axis
perpendicular to the page through the center of the nut at point A. The M is
bold because moments are vector quantities, and the subscript A indicates the
axis or center of rotation. The direction of the moment can be either clockwise
or counterclockwise, depending on how the force is applied. If the nut is frozen,
no actual rotation occurs, but the force still produces a tendency to rotate it, i.e.
a moment.

                                                 122

Figure 4.0.1 A moment MA is created about point A by force F.

4.1 Moment of Force

A moment of force, or torque, is a measure of the tendency of that force to
rotate a body about a selected point or axis, called the moment center. This
tendency increases with the magnitude of the force, and also with the distance
between the line of action of the force and the moment center.

    Moments are vector quantities, so they have magnitude and direction and
obey all the rules of vector arithmetic, even dot and cross products, described
in Chapter 2.

4.1.1 Magnitude of a Moment

The magnitude of a moment describes how hard it turns, in the same way that
the magnitude of a force describes how hard it pushes or pulls. When you turn
a door knob, the magnitude of the moment is how hard you twist the knob.

    The magnitude of a moment is found by multiplying the magnitude of the
force by the distance between the line of action of the force and the center of
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  124

rotation, as illustrated in Figure 4.1.1. This distance called the moment arm
or the perpendicular distance, d.

M = F d.                                   (4.1.1)

    Since the moment is the product of the force's magnitude and the perpendic-
ular distance, the closer the point is to the force's line of action, the smaller the
moment. If the point lies upon the force's line of action, then the moment arm is
zero, making the moment zero as well. But notice that a force may be slid along
its line-of-action without changing the moment, because neither the magnitude
of the force nor the moment arm changes. The magnitude of a moment is a pos-
itive quantity regardless of whether it produces a clockwise or counterclockwise
tendency.

    Moments are the product of a force with a distance, so they have units of
[force] × [distance] such as N-m or ft-lb.

       ments.

                     M2 = T d2 = (1500 lb)(13.06 ft) = 19, 590 ft·lb
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  126

By inspection, we see that the tension produces a counterclockwise rota-
tion and the load produces a clockwise rotation. Counterclockwise moment
M2 is greater than the clockwise moment M1 because the boom pendant
must also support the weight of the boom, which we have not accounted
for.
As we will see in the next section, counterclockwise moments indicate a
positive scalar moment in two dimensions, and a vector that points in the
+k direction in three.

Solution. This problem is similar to the previous example, but the geom-
etry required to find the perpendicular distance is slightly more difficult.

   C and the angle  in triangle ABC.

2. Then, find the angle  in the right triangle and solve for the perpen-
   dicular distance.

3. Finally, use (4.1.1) to find the magnitude of MA created by 400 N
   force F .
                               MA = F d = 2596 N·m

   This force produces a clockwise rotation of the column, so the corre-
   sponding scalar moment is negative and the moment expressed as a
   vector is

                                   MA = 2596 N·m 

4.1.2 Direction of a Moment

In two-dimensional problems, moment vectors are perpendicular to the page
and moments simplify to clockwise or counterclockwise rotation about a point,
called the point of interest or moment center. The point of interest can
be visualized as the point where the axis of rotation pierces the page. Since
these moment vectors point into the third dimension, they are usually drawn as
circular arrows in the plane of the page.

    Consider the two moments acting on a horizontal surface, shown below. To
determine the sense of these moments, i.e. whether the vectors point up or
down, apply the right-hand rule. Imagine grasping the axis of rotation with
your right hand, with your fingers curling in the direction of rotation; your
thumb then points in the direction of the moment vector. Using this technique,
we observe that counterclockwise moments point upward, or out of the page,
while the clockwise moments point downward or into the page. In other words,
counterclockwise moment vectors point towards the positive z direction and
clockwise moments point in the -z direction.

    x

Figure 4.1.4 Moments in the plane of the page.

    Pause your reading now to apply the right-hand rule yourself to determine
the direction of the two moments in Figure 4.1.4

    In three dimensions, moment vectors are more difficult to visualize, because
they can point in any direction in 3-D space, however they still point along an
axis of rotation with sense determined by the right hand rule.

    As discussed in Subsection 2.8.1, there are several alternative methods for
applying the right-hand rule, however they all define a direction that is mutually
perpendicular to two other vectors. To find the direction of a moment, the first
of these vectors is a position vector which points from the point of interest to a
point on the force's line of action, and is designated r. The second vector is the
force, F.

    With the three-finger method, you align your right-hand index finger with
vector r and your middle finger with the force F; your thumb will point in the
direction of the moment vector. Alternatively, you can align your thumb with
r and your index finger with F; your middle finger will point in the direction of
the moment vector.

Figure 4.1.5 Three-finger right-hand rule for moments.

    With the point-and-curl method, place your right hand flat and point your
fingertips in the direction of r. Rotate your hand until the force F is perpendic-
ular to the back of your hand and can rotate your fingers. In this position, your
thumb defines the direction of the moment vector and also the axis of rotation.

    Any of these techniques may be used to find the direction of a moment. They

all produce the same result so you don't need to learn them all, but make sure
you have at least one method you can use accurately and consistently.

4.2 Scalar Addition of Moments

Since moments are vectors, they add according to the rules of vector addition.
In three dimensions this usually involves finding the x, y, and z components of
two or more moments and adding them to find the components of the resultant
moment.

    A simpler and more interactive approach using scalar components is available
for moments in two dimensions.

4.2.1 Scalar Components

In Subsection 3.3.2 we saw that vectors can be expressed as the product of a
scalar component and a unit vector. For example, a 100 N force acting in
the -j direction, i.e. straight down, can be represented by

                                     F = Fy j = -100 N j,

where Fy = -100 N is the scalar component and j is the unit vector. The absolute
value of Fy determines the magnitude of the force, and unit vector along with
the sign of Fy determines its direction. The negative sign here indicates that the
direction of F is opposite to the direction of j.

    We have previously established two sign conventions for scalar components;
we now add a third:

   · For forces acting in the x direction, right is positive, corresponding to the
       direction of i.

   · For forces acting in the y direction, up is positive, corresponding to the
       direction of j.

   · For moments acting in the x-y plane, counterclockwise moments are posi-
       tive, corresponding to the direction of k according to the right-hand rule.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  130

    Example 4.2.1 Sign Conventions.

    For each scalar component, determine whether the moment is clockwise or
    counterclockwise, and apply the right-hand rule to determine the direction
    of the corresponding moment vector.

       A M1 = 30 N·m

        B M2 = -400 kN·m

       C M3 = 25 N·m 
       D M4 = -100 ft·lb 

    Solution. By the right-hand rule, counterclockwise moments in the x-
    y plane are vectors that point in the +k direction. The corresponding
    scalar component has a positive sign. Clockwise moments point in the -k
    direction and have a negative sign.

       A M1 is positive, so it is CCW and the vector points in the +k direc-
           tion.

        B M2 is negative, so it is CW and the vector points -k direction.

       C The arrow on M3 establishes the positive direction as CW. A positive
           scalar component means that the direction is CW and the vector
           points in the -k direction.

       D The arrow on M4 establishes the positive direction as CW, but the
           negative sign on the scalar component means that the actual moment
           is CCW. The vector points in the +k direction.

In three dimensions, moments, like forces, can be resolved into components in
the x, y, and z directions.

                                   M = Mx i + My j + Mz k.

This means that the three scalar components are required to fully specify a
moment in three dimensions, whereas only one is required for moments in a
plane.

   Warning 4.2.2

    Be careful not to mix up magnitudes with scalar components.

       · Both are scalar values with units.

       · Magnitudes are never negative. Scalar components may be positive
           or negative.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  131

· Scalar components always have an associated sign convention. It
   may be implied or specifically indicated. If the sign convention is
   unstated, assume that counterclockwise moments in the x-y plane
   are positive.

· There is no special symbol or notation to indicate whether a quantity
   represents a vector magnitude or a scalar moment, so pay attention
   to context.

4.2.2 Addition of Moments

Scalar components are most useful for adding and finding the resultant of several
moments. When moments are expressed in terms of scalar components, vector
addition reduces to algebraic addition of the scalar components.

    To add several moments in a plane using scalar components, simply append
a positive sign to the magnitude of counterclockwise moments and a negative
sign to clockwise moments to create scalar components, then add the scalar
components normally.

    The resulting algebraic sum of the scalar components will be either positive,
negative, or zero, and this sign indicates the direction of the resultant moment.
If the result is positive, the resultant acts in the direction of the positive unit
vector, and in the opposite direction if it is negative.

    Example 4.2.3 Scalar addition.

    Find the resultant of the following three moments:
    M1 = 25 kN·m , M2 = 40 kN·m , and M3 = 30 kN·m 
    Solution. Manually attaching the positive or negative signs according
    to the right-hand rule turns the magnitudes into scalar moments:

                                        M1 = -25 kN·m
                                        M2 = +40 kN·m
                                        M3 = -30 kN·m

   Adding these moments algebraically gives the resultant scalar moment.

                     M = M1 + M2 + M3
                         = (-25 kN·m) + (40 kN·m) + (-30 kN·m)
                         = -15 kN·m

   The negative sign indicates that the direction of the resultant moment is
    clockwise.
    Interpreting the scalar moment as a vector gives:

                                        M = 15 kN·m 
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE           132

The corresponding magnitude of M is
                                     |M| = 15 kN·m

4.3 Varignon's Theorem

Varignon's Theorem is a method to calculate moments developed in 1687 by
French mathematician Pierre Varignon (1654 - 1722). It states that

       The sum of the moments of several concurrent forces about a point
       is equal to the moment of the resultant of those forces, or alternately,
       the moment of a force about a point equals the sum of the moments
       of its components.

This means you can find the moment of a force by first breaking it into compo-
nents, evaluating the moments of the individual components, and finally sum-
ming them to find the net moment about the point.

    This may sound like more work than just finding the moment of the original
force, but in practice, it is often easier.

    When applying Varignon's Theorem, you are free to select components in
any direction, but the two most convenient choices are discussed below.

4.3.1 Parallel and Perpendicular Components

The first common way to apply Verignon's Theorem is to break the force creating
the moment into two components, one parallel with the line segment connecting
the moment center with the point of application of the force, and the other
perpendicular to it.

    Consider the wrench in the interactive diagram below. Assume that the
length of the handle is d, the magnitude of the force is F , and the angle between
the force and the handle is . The components parallel to the wrench handle
and perpendicular to it are

F = F cos  F = F sin .

    By Verignon's theorem and the definition of the moment, (4.1.1), the sum of
the moments of the components simplifies to:

M = Fd,                                             (4.3.1)

because the contribution of the parallel component is zero since its line of action
passes through the moment center A.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  133

Live Link

Figure 4.3.1 Varignon's Theorem: Perpendicular Component

    This result agrees with our intuitive understanding of how a wrench works;
the greatest torque is developed when the force is applied at a right angle to the
handle.

    Equations (4.1.1) and (4.3.1) not only produce the same result, they are
completely identical. If the length of the handle is d and the angle between the
force F and the handle is , then d = d sin , and F = F sin . Using either
equation to calculate the moment gives

M=         F d  = F (d sin )  = F d sin .  (4.3.2)
           F d  = (F sin ) d
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                              134

Example 4.3.2 Verignon's Theorem: Parallel and Perpendicular Compo-
nents.

A gardener is moving soil with                                      F

a wheelbarrow. The length of the

handle from A to B is 45 in, and

in the position shown,  is 25.                                   B

Find the moment created

about axle A when she applies a

vertical 30 lb force at B by re-          A

solving force F into components

parallel and perpendicular to the

handle.

Solution.

                                   45 in

           A

When the handle makes an angle of  with the horizontal axis, the per-
pendicular component of F makes the same angle with the vertical, so
resolving F into perpendicular and parallel components gives:

         F = F cos  = 27.19 lb            F = F sin  = 12.68 lb

Summing the moments of the components we find

           MA = F(45 in) + F(0) = 1224 in·lb

Note that the parallel component does not contribute to the moment.

4.3.2 Horizontal and Vertical Components

Varignon's theorem is particularly convenient in situations where horizontal and
vertical dimensions are provided, as is often the case. If you decompose the
forces into horizontal and vertical components, you can find the moments of the
components without difficulty. The resultant moment is the sum of the moments
of the components.

    Verignon's Equation is (4.3.3) and Figure 4.3.3 is the corresponding diagram
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                        135

for the moment of force F about point A. Notice that the horizontal component
is multiplied by the vertical distance, and the vertical component is multiplied
by the horizontal distance since these are the perpendiculars, and that the signs
on the terms can be either positive or negative, depending on the direction of
the component moments.

M = ±(Fx dy) ± (Fy dx)                        (4.3.3)

Figure 4.3.3 Verignon's Theorem Horizontal and Vertical Components

    When applying Verignon's Theorem (4.3.3), take care to assign the correct
sign to the individual moment terms; counterclockwise moments are positive,
and clockwise negative are negative according to the right-hand rule, regardless
of whether Fx acts left or right, or whether Fy acts up or down.

    Example 4.3.4 Varignon's Theorem: Horizontal and Vertical Components.

    A 750 lb force is applied to the          3 ft 60° F
frame as shown. Determine the                                 B
moment this force makes about
point A by resolving the force        2 ft
into horizontal and vertical com-          A
ponents and applying Varignon's
Theorem.

Solution. Force F acts 60 from the vertical with a 750 lb magnitude,
so its horizontal and vertical components are

                               Fx = F sin 60 = 649.5 lb
                               Fy = F cos 60 = 375.0 lb

For component Fx, the perpendicular distance from point A is 2 ft so the
moment of this component is

                         M1 = 2Fx = 1299 ft·lb Clockwise.

For component Fy, the perpendicular distance from point A is 3 ft so the
moment of this component is

                     M2 = 3Fy = 1125 ft·lb counterclockwise.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  136

Assigning a negative sign to M1 and a positive sign to M2 to account for
their directions and summing, gives the moment of F about A.

                                  MA = -M1 + M2
                                       = -1299 + 1125
                                       = -174 ft·lb

The negative sign indicates that the resultant moment is clockwise, with
a magnitude of 174 ft·lb.

                              MA = 174 ft·lb Clockwise.

4.3.3 Moment Cross Products

The most robust and general method to a moment of a force is to use the vector

cross product

               M = r × F,                  (4.3.4)

where F is the force creating the moment, and r is a position vector from the
moment center to any point on the line of action of the force, as shown in
Figure 4.3.5. The cross product is a vector multiplication operation, and the
result is a vector perpendicular to the two vectors being multiplied.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  137

                Live Link

Figure 4.3.5 Moment cross product. M = r × F
    The cross product method is most often used to find moments in three di-

mensions, as will be discussed in Section 4.4, but it can also be applied in
two-dimensional problems.

    The next example demonstrates the technique and compares it to the other
methods we have already discussed. You will see that the cross product method
is mathematically identical to applying Verignon's theorem.

A

This problem demonstrates four different ways you can solve the problem.
The first two methods use vector algebra; the second two take a scalar
approach that uses geometry and right-triangle trigonometry. All four
methods are mathematically identical.

 (a) Find the moment of F about point A using Varignon's Theorem,

                                MA = (rx × Fy) + (ry × Fx) .

       Answer. MA = 1664.10 ft·lbf (+k)
       Solution. Varignon's Theorem states that the moment of a force
       is the sum of the moments of its components. In this example, we
       will determine the vertical and horizontal components of r and F,
       then add the cross products of the two perpendicular pairs.

                                                                                                                      F

                                                                                                                                         3
                                                                                                                                    2

                                                                                                 B

                                                  2

      Find the components of r and F.

                             F = 500 lbfcos 56.3, sin 56.3
                                = 277.35, 416.025 lbf

                              r = 6, 3 ft

      Finally, following Varignon's Theorem, add the cross products of the
      perpendicular component pairs.

                  MA = (rx × Fy) + (ry × Fx)
                       = 6 ft · 416.025 lbf (k) + 3 ft · 277.35 lbf (-k)
                       = 1664.1 ft·lbf (+k)

      Notes:

        · When finding the moment of two-dimensional vectors in com-
            ponent form, this is often the preferred method, as it is quick
            and most find the process intuitive.

        · The first cross product, rx × Fy, has a positive value because
            i × j = +k, not because you are simply multiplying two positive
            components.

        · The second cross product, ry × Fx, results in a negative value
            because j × i = -k.

        · All moments have units of force times distance, in this case [ft
            · lbf].

        · The overall sign of MA determines the final direction. A pos-
            itive value corresponds to a counterclockwise moment - right
            thumb out of the page - and a negative value indicates a clock-
            wise moment. See Figure 4.1.6 for the hand diagram.

(b) Find the moment of F about point A using a vector cross product,

                                         MA = r × F.

                         We can also solve for the mo-

                     3 ment MA using the vector determi-

                  2      nant method of Subsection 2.8.3.

               B         We can use the values of , r,

                         and F computed in part (a) above.

                         Jumping straight into the vector

A                        determinant, we find:

   MA = r × F

   277.35 416.025 0

   = 6 ft (416.025 lbf) (k) + 3 ft (277.35 lbf) (-k)

   = 1664.1 ft·lbf (+k)

     Notes:

        · Determinants are a robust way to compute two-dimensional
            cross products, but take a bit more effort than Varignon's The-
            orem. The math is exactly the same either way, which means
            that Varignon's Theorem is just a shortcut to working through
            a two-dimensional vector determinant.

        · The signs on the cross-product terms rx × Fy and ry × Fx still
            come from the right-hand rule, and conveniently the process
            of multiplying diagonals in the determinant takes care of the
            signs.

        · Recognize that the reason we multiply diagonals in a determi-
            nant is that we only want to multiply the perpendicular com-
            ponents.

(c) Find the moment of F about point A by finding the perpendicular
     distance d,
                                         MA = F d.

Answer. MA = 1664.10 ft·lbf (+k)
Solution.

                            F

                         3         This solution requires you to
                    2
                               find the perpendicular distance d
      B                        between the point A and line-of-

                               action of F. One way to find this

   C                           distance is shown below.

A

(a) Draw a moderately large and accurate diagram. Too much con-
     fusion has been created by small, inaccurately-drawn diagrams.
     Include a right triangle whose hypotenuse connects the moment
     center A with a convenient point on the line of action of F. We
     have chosen point C = (0, -3), although point B would work
     as well. Can you prove that C is on the line of action?

(b) Since the angle  between the line of action of the force and
     any horizontal line is the same everywhere,  appears three
     more times on this diagram, and gives us an angle in the right
     triangle.

(c) Use right triangle trigonometry to find d.

                                 sin  = d
                                           AC

                                   d = AC (sin )
                                        = 4 (sin 56.3)
                                        = 3.328 ft

(d) Finally, compute the moment about A.

                             MA = F d
                                   = 3.328 ft (500 lbf)
                                   = 1664.10 ft·lbf

                             MA = 1664.10 ft·lbf (+k)

     The (+k) direction of MA comes from the observation of the
     right-hand rule, as scalar moment computations are not direc-
     tional.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  142

(d) Find the moment of F about point A by finding the perpendicular
      component of F,
                                          MA = F d.

     Answer. MA = 1664.10 ft·lbf (+k)

      Solution.

D        6 ft  B  F This solution requires you to
                      find the rectangular component of
3 ft                  force F perpendicular to segment
                      dconnecting the moment center A
      A               with a point on the line of action
                      of F.
                           One approach to finding F is
                      shown below.

(a) Draw a large and accurate diagram to assist in finding the dis-
     tances and angles in this problem.
     Draw a line through point A and the point where F acts, or
     to any other convenient point on its line of action. Then draw
     a rectangle aligned with this line, indicating the parallel and
     perpendicular components of F. This rectangle consists of two
     congruent right triangles, having the force as their common
     hypotenuse. You will need to find an angle inside the triangle
     to find the components.

(b) Use triangle ABD to compute angle  and the length of the
     hypotenuse d.

                              = tan-1 3 = 26.565
                                             6

                                    
                              d = 62 + 32 = 6.708 ft

(c) Recalling that we have previously found  = 56.31, find .

                                  =  -  = 29.74

(d) Find F using the force triangle.

                               F = F sin 
                                   = 500 lbf sin 29.74
                                   = 248.07 lbf
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  143

             (e) Finally, compute the magnitude MA and the vector MA.

                                          MA = Fd
                                               = 248.07 lbf · 6.708 ft

                                          MA = 1664.10 ft·lbf (+k)

                  The counterclockwise direction (+k) comes from the right-hand
                  rule, since scalar moment computations are not directional.

We have discussed several different approaches for finding the moment of a force
about a point in the preceding sections. While all of these methods produce
the same result, you will frequently find that one method is computationally
simpler to apply than another. The simplest method generally depends on what
is known and unknown in a given situation, so we recommend that you become
familiar with all these methods.

    The interactive diagram below will help you visualize the different approaches
for finding moments that were covered.

4.4 3D Moments

    Key Questions
       · Where does the moment arm vector r start and end?
       · Why does Varignon's Theorem give you the same answer as a deter-
           minant?
       · How can you combine a dot product and a cross product to find the
           moment about a line?
       · Why does a mixed-triple determinant give you a scalar while a cross-
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                 145

           product determinant gives you a vector?

    The circular arrows we used to represent vectors in two dimensions are un-
clear in three dimensions, so instead, moments are represented as arrows with
x, y, and z components, like force and position vectors. You will sometimes
see moments indicated with double arrowheads to differentiate them from force
vectors.

    In three dimensions, it is usually not convenient to use geometry to find the
moment arm for equation (4.1.1), so instead we will use the vector cross product
method, which is easier to apply but less intuitive.

4.4.1 3D Cross Products

The mathematics of cross products was discussed in Section 2.8, and equation
(2.8.1) provides one method to calculate a moment cross products

M = |r||F| sin  u^                                        (4.4.1)

. Here,  is the angle between the two vectors as shown in Figure 4.3.5 above,
and u^ is the unit vector perpendicular to both r and F with the direction coming
from the right-hand rule. This equation is useful if you know or can find the
magnitudes of r and F and the angle  between them. This equation is the vector
equivalent of (4.3.2).

    Alternatively, if you know or can find the components of the position r and
force F vectors, it's typically easiest to evaluate the moment cross product using
the determinant form discussed in Subsection 2.8.3.

M=r×F                                                     (4.4.2)

         i jk
   = rx ry rz

       Fx Fy Fz
   = (ryFz - rzFy) i - (rxFz - rzFx) j + (rxFy - ryFx) k

    Here, rx, ry, and rz are components of the vector describing the distance
from the point of interest to the force. Fx, Fy, and Fz are components of the
force. The resulting moment has three components.

                                     Mx = (ryFz - rzFy)
                                     My = -(rxFz - rzFx)
                                     Mz = (rxFy - ryFx)

These represent the component moments acting around each of the three coor-
dinate axes. Note the negative sign in front of My, which ensures that the cross
products maintain the correct signs. The magnitude of the resultant moment
can be calculated using the three-dimensional Pythagorean Theorem.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                     146

M = |M| = Mx2 + My2 + Mz2                                     (4.4.3)

    It is important to avoid three common mistakes when setting up the cross
product.

· The order must always be r × F, never F × r. The moment arm r appears
   in the middle line of the determinant and the force F on the bottom line.

· The moment arm r must always be measured from the moment center to
   the line of action of the force. Never from the force to the point.

· The signs of the components of r and F must follow those of a right-hand
   coordinate system.

In two dimensions, rz and Fz are zero, so (4.4.2) reduces to

M=r×F                                                         (4.4.4)

         i jk
   = rx ry 0

       Fx Fy 0
   = (rxFy - ryFx) k

. This is just the vector equivalent of Varignon's Theorem in two dimensions,
with the correct signs automatically determined from the signs on the scalar
components of F and r.

4.4.2 Moment about a Point

The next two interactives should help you visualize moments in three dimensions.
    The first shows the force vector, position vector, and the resulting moment

all placed at the origin for simplicity. The moment is perpendicular to the plane
containing F and r and has a magnitude equal to the `area' of the parallelogram
with F and r for sides.

Figure 4.4.1 Moment about the origin.
    The second interactive shows a more realistic situation. The moment center

is at an arbitrary point A, and the line of action of force F passes through
arbitrary points P1 and P2. The position vector r is the vector from A to a point
on the line of action, and the force F can be slid anywhere along that line.

                          1.0 m     D. Find the moment caused by the ten-
                          2 kN      sion force around point O.

                       D
   z 0.4 m

Solution. Start the problem by using the position information and ten-

sion magnitude to find the force vector FBD. This will be done in three
steps:
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE     149

1. Find the position vector BD: Find position vectors by either sub-
   tracting the start-point coordinates from the end-point coordinates
   or focusing on the changes in the position components from B to D.

                      BD = D - B
                            = (0.4, 0, 1.0) m - (-0.9, 1.1, 0) m
                            = 1.3, -1.1, 1 m

2. Find the unit vector of BD: Compute a unit vector by dividing BD
   by the total length of BD.

                       BD = |BD| = 1.32 + (-1.1)2 + 1.02
                            = 1.975 m

                       BD = BD
                                BD

                            = 1.3, -1.1, 1 m
                                     1.975 m

                            = 0.658, -0.557, 0.506

   Note that BD is unitless and is the pure direction of BD.

3. Multiply the unit vector by force magnitude: Now multiply BD by
   the 2 kN force magnitude to find the force components.

                         FBD = FBD(BD)
                                = 2 kN 0.658, -0.557, 0.506
                                = 1.317, -1.114, 1.013 kN

Next, find the moment arm from point O to the line of action of the force.
There are two obvious options for moment arms, either rOB or rOD. To
demonstrate how both moment arms give the same answer, solutions for
both moment arms will be shown.
Option 1: Moment using rOB

                   y

B  0.9 m              A

     z 0.4 m

                      D
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                      150

· Moment arm rOB starts at the point we are taking the moment
   around, O, and ends at the point B.

                         OB = B - O
                              = (-0.9, 1.1, 0) m - (0, 0, 0) m
                              = -0.9, 1.1, 0 m

· Cross rOB with FBD to find the moment of FBD about point O.

MO = rOB × FBD

                              i               j            k

   = -0.9 1.1                                              0

                              1.317 -1.114 1.013

   = 1.114, 0.911, -0.446 kN

Option 2: Moment using rOD :

                                     y

B                             0.9 m     A

                                        1.1 m

                                        O               x

C                                       rOD      1.0 m
     z 0.4 m
                                           D

                                                 2 kN

· Moment arm rOD starts at the point we are taking the moment
   around, O, and ends at the point D.

OD = D - O
     = (0.4, 0, 1.0) m - (0, 0, 0) m
     = 0.4, 0, 1.0 m

· Cross rOD with FBD to find the moment of FBD about point O.

MO = rOD × FBD

                              i               j            k

   = 0.4                                      0        1.0

                              1.317 -1.114 1.013

   = 1.114, 0.911, -0.446 kN
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE    151

It is worth your effort to compute moments both ways for this example, or
another problem, to prove to yourself that the answers work out exactly
the same with different moment arms. You can actually select a moment
arm from O to any point on line BD and get the same result, but B and
D are points on that line that we already know.

Drawing MO, demonstrates that a moment vector direction is both 1) the
axis of rotation caused by TBD around point O, with the moment aligning
to your thumb and the moment rotating around your fingers from the right-

hand rule and 2) that MO is perpendicular to the plane formed by TBD
and TBD. Recall that all cross products result in vectors perpendicular to
the two crossed vectors.

4.4.3 Moment about a Line

In three dimensions, the moment of a force about a point can be resolved into
components about the x, y and z axes. The moment produces a rotational
tendency about all three axes simultaneously, but only a portion of the total
moment acts about any particular axis.

    We are often interested in finding the effect of a moment about a specific line
or axis. For example, consider the moment created by a push on a door handle.
Unless you push with a force exactly perpendicular to the hinge, only a portion
of the total moment you produce will act around the hinge axis and be effective
to open the door. The moment we are looking for is the vector projection of
the moment onto the axis of interest. Vector projections were first discussed in
Subsection 2.7.4.

Figure 4.4.5 Moment of a force about a line
    To find the moment of a force about a line, three vectors are required:

   · u^, a unit vector pointing in the direction of the line or axis of interest.

   · r, a position vector from any point on the line of interest to any point on
       the line of action of the force.

   · F, the force vector. If you have multiple concurrent forces, you can treat
       them individually or add them together first and find the moment of the
       resultant.

    Using these three vectors, we can compute the magnitude of the moment
about a line in two related, but unique ways.

    Two-Step Method: Separates the cross and dot products into two distinct
steps.

   · First, compute the moment of a the force about any point on the line of
       interest using the cross product, (4.3.4).

                                               M = (r × F)
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  154

   · Next, find the scalar projection of the moment onto the line of interest
       using a dot product, (2.7.10).

                                     Mline =  proju M = M · u^

    Scalar Triple Product: Combines the cross and dot product into the de-
terminant of a 3 × 3 matrix formed from the three vectors above.

   · The scalar triple product consists of taking the determinant of a matrix
       consisting of the components of the line's unit vector u^ in the top row,
       the components of a position vector r in the middle row, and the compo-
       nents of the F in the bottom row. The determiant can be computed in
       multiple ways, but we suggest using the augmented determinant method
       Figure 2.8.6 or computing it directly in a calculator which allows 3 × 3
       matrix computations.

   · Here are the computations:

       Mline =  proju M = u^ · (r × F)
                                    ux uy uz

                                = rx ry rz
                                    Fx Fy Fz

                                = (ryFz - rzFy) ux + (rzFx - rxFz) uy + (rxFy - ryFx) uz

· Note that the above determinant does not contain any unit vectors, like
   the i, j, and k vectors that show up in the top of cross-product determi-
   nants. Therefore, you are just multiplying the numbers in the diagonals
   and adding them up to a scalar value.

    A positive value indicates that the moment vector points in the u^ direction,
while a negative value indicates the moment points in the opposite direction.

    Finally if you need to find the vector components of this moment about a
line, multiplying the scalar projection by the line's unit vector will add direction
to your scalar moment value, (2.7.11)

(a) Find the magnitude of the moment caused by force P1 about line
     BG.

Answer. MP1 about BG = 0 ft·lbf

Solution. The key observation to find the moment of P1 about
line BG is that the line of action of P1 goes directly through line BG,
thus force P1 produces no moment about line BG. Force P1 still
pulls on the box and line BG, but causes no rotation about line BG.
While you could set up a two-step or mixed triple to compute this
moment, the simplest moment arm from line BG to force P1 would
be r = 0, 0, 0 ft which results in a MP1 about BG = 0 ft·lbf.

(b) Find the magnitude of the moment caused by force P2 about line
      BG.

Answer. MP2 about BG = 35.355 ft·lbf

Solution. Keep in mind that to compute the magnitude of a mo-
ment about a line, we need to compute a vector moment about a
point on the line and then dot this vector moment onto the line's
unit vector. There are two options for this computation:

Option 1: The Two-Step Method separates the cross and dot prod-
ucts into two distinct steps.

· Compute the vector moment of P1 about any point on line BG,
   including MG or MB, then

· Dot M onto the unit vector BG

Option 2: The Scalar Triple Product combines the cross and dot
product into a single matrix determinant, including the following
vectors:

· Top row: Unit vector for the line of interest BG
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                                                                             156

· Middle row: Moment arm from line of interest to force vector.
   We'll use rHG as it has the most zeros, which will simplify the
   algebra when computing the determinant.

· Bottom row: Components of force vector P2.

Let's set up the vectors for the scalar triple product, starting with
the unit vector BG.

The unit vector BG is found by dividing the position vector BG by
its own magnitude.

BG = BG = -2.0, 0.0, 2.0 ft = -0.707, 0.0, 0.707
BG  (-2)2 + 02 + 22 ft

    Next, the middle row of the scalar                                                      z  P2 line of action

are four options that will all result in                                                                          interest
the same answer after you compute                                                              rGD C
the scalar triple product.

rGH = 0.0, -2.0, 0.0 ft                                                                        rBH

rGD = 2.0, -2.0, 0.0 ft

rBH = -2.0, -2.0, 2.0 ft                                                                       rBD                Fy

rBD = 0.0, -2.0, 2.0 ft                                                              A         PB
                                                                                                    1

                                                                                  x

We'll use rGH going forward as it is a
one-dimensional vector and the zeros

will simplify the determinant.

Finally, the bottom row of the scalar triple product are the force
vector components.

    P2 = 25, 0, 0 lbf

Now, combining the three vectors, here is the triple scalar product
matrix:

                        -0.707 0 0.707
MP2 about BG = 0.0 ft -2.0 ft 0.0 ft = 35.355 ft·lbf

                         25 lbf 0 lbf 0 lbf
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                               157

    Hence, the magnitude of the mo-                 z  rGH     G
ment caused by force P2 about line              H           C     MBG
BG is 35.355 ft·lbf. As we found a pos-     P2
itive answer, this confirms that the ro-  D
tation caused by P2 is in the same di-
rection as the vector BG, which is re-        A                   BG
inforced by the right-hand rule thumb     x

                                                             B

Validating the answer with the 2-step approach, we could first sum
the moment of P2 about point G.

MG = (2 ft)(25 lbf) k^

Given that the MG k^ moment and line BG lie in a 2-D plane, you
could even use a \ang{45} right triangle instead of a dot product to
find the amount of MG which lies along line BG.

                            MBG = MG(cos 45)
                            MBG = 50 ft·lbf(0.707)
                            MBG = 35.355 ft·lbf

Not all problems have simple geometry where you can form a right
triangle to perform a dot product, but this process demonstrates the
two-step combination of a cross and a dot product to find a moment
about a line.

4.5 Couples

   Key Questions

       · What makes a couple different than a typical r × F moment?

       · Why is a couple considered a pure moment?

       · If a couple is applied about the point we are summing moments,
           does it still need to be included in the sum of moments equation?

    The moments we have considered so far were all caused by single forces
producing rotation about a moment center. In this section, we will consider
another type of moment, called a couple.

    A couple consists of two parallel forces, equal in magnitude, opposite in
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  158

direction, and non-coincident. Couples are special because the pair of forces
always cancel each other, which means that a couple produces a rotational effect
but never translation. For this reason, couples are sometimes referred to as "pure
moments." The strength of the rotational effect is called the moment of the
couple or the couple-moment.

    When a single force causes a moment about a point, the magnitude depends
on the magnitude of the force and the location of the point. In contrast, the
moment of a couple is the same at every point and only depends on the magnitude
of the opposite forces and the distance between them.

    For example, consider the interactive where two equal and opposite forces
with different lines of action form a couple. The moment of this couple is found
by summing the moments of the two forces about an arbitrary moment center
A, applying positive or negative signs for each term according to the right-hand
rule. The moment of the couple is always

M = F d                                    (4.5.1)

where d is the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces.

                Live Link

Figure 4.5.1 Moment of a couple.
    In two dimensions, couples are represented by a curved arrow indicating the

direction of the rotational effect. Following the right-hand rule, the value will
be positive if the moment is counterclockwise and negative if it is clockwise. In
three dimensions, a couple is represented by a normal vector arrow.

    When adding moments to find the total or resultant moment, you must
include couple-moments as well the r × F moments. In equation form, we could
express this as:

                               MP = (r × F) + (Mcouple)
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  159

Thinking Deeper 4.5.2 Location Independence.

In this section, we have shown that couples produce the same moment at
every point on the body. This means that the external effect of couples
is location independent. Because the moment of a couple is location inde-
pendent, the moment vector is not bound to any particular point and for
this reason is a free vector.
We will learn in Chapter 8 that moving a couple around on a rigid body
does affect the internal loads or stresses inside a body, but changing the
location of a couple does not change the external loading or reactions.

4.6 Equivalent Transformations

    Key Questions

       · What is an equivalent transformation?

       · What are some examples of equivalent transformations?

       · What are external effects?

    An equivalent transformation occurs when a loading on an object is replaced
with another loading that has the same external effect on the object. By external
effect, we mean the response of the body that we can see from the outside, with
no consideration of what happens to it internally. If the object is a free body, the
external effect would be translation and rotation. In statics, since objects are
not accelerating, the external effect really means the reactions at the supports
required to maintain equilibrium. The external effects will be exactly the same
before and after an equivalent transformation.

    Equivalent transformation permits us to swap out one set of forces with
another one without changing the fundamental physics of the situation. This is
usually done to simplify or clarify the situation, or to give you an alternate way
to think about, understand, and solve a mechanics problem.

    You already know several equivalent transformations, although we have not
used this terminology before. Here are some transformations you applied before.

Vector Addition. When you add forces together using the rules of vector
addition, you are performing an equivalent transformation. You can swap out
two or more components and replace them with a single equivalent resultant
force.

    Any number of concurrent forces can be added together to produce a sin-
gle resultant force. By definition, the lines of action of concurrent forces all
intersect at a common point. The resultant must be placed at this intersection
point for the replacement to be equivalent. This is because before and after the
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  160

replacement, the moment about the intersection point is zero. If the resultant
was placed somewhere else, that would not be true.

Replacing a Force with its Component. Resolving forces into components
is also an equivalent transformation, as it is the inverse operation of vector ad-
dition. The components are usually orthogonal and in the coordinate directions,
or in a given plane and perpendicular to it, but any combination of force com-
ponents that add to the original force is equivalent.

Figure 4.6.1 Equivalent transformations of vectors

    In this diagram,

                         F = F1 + F2 = (F ; ) = F cos , F sin .

The effects of the force in the x, y, and (in three dimensions the z) directions
remain the same, and by Varignon's theorem, we know that the moment these
forces make about any point will also be the same.

    An interesting special case occurs when two forces are equal and opposite
and have the same line of action. When these are added together, they cancel
out, so replacing these two forces with nothing is an equivalent transformation.
The opposite is true as well, so you can make two equal and opposite forces
spontaneously appear at a point if you wish.

   Thinking Deeper 4.6.2 Internal Effects.

   We made a point of saying that equivalent systems of force have the same
    external effect on the body. This implies that there may be some other
    effects that are not the same. As you will see in Chapter 8, we sometimes
    need to consider internal forces and moments. These are the forces inside
    a body that hold all the parts of the object to each other, otherwise, it
   would break apart and fail. Although the external effects are the same for
    all equivalent systems, the internal forces depend on the specifics of how
    the loads are applied.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                     161

    Let's imagine that you have
gone off-roading and have managed
to get your Jeep stuck in the mud.
You have two basic options to get it
out: you can pull it out using the
winch on the front bumper, or you
can ask your friend to push you out
with his truck. Both methods (as-
suming that they apply forces with
the same magnitude, direction, and
line of action) are statically equiv-
alent, and both will equally move
your vehicle forward.

The difference is what might happen to your vehicle. With one method,
there's a danger that you will rip your front bumper off, with the other
you might damage your rear bumper. These are the internal effects, and
they depend on where the equivalent force is applied. These forces are
necessary to maintain rigidity and hold the parts of the body together.

Sliding a force along its line of action. Sliding a force along its line of
action is an equivalent transformation because sliding a force does not change
its magnitude, direction or the perpendicular distance from the line of action to
any point, so the moments it creates do not change either. This transformation
is called the "Principle of Transmissibility".

Figure 4.6.3 Sliding a vector along its line of action

Replacing a couple with couple-moment or vice-versa. A couple, de-
fined as "two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action," pro-
duces a pure turning action that is equivalent to a concentrated moment, called
the couple-moment. Couples and couple-moments have no translational effect.
Couple-moments are free vectors, which means that they are not bound to any
point. Their external effect is on the entire body and is the same regardless of
where it is applied.

    This means that you are free to swap out a couple for its couple-moment, or
swap a couple-moment for a couple that has the same moment, and you may
put the replacement anywhere on you please and it will still be equivalent.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                              162

The diagram shows a series of equivalent transformations of a couple.

Figure 4.6.4 Equivalent transformations of couples

    Concentrated moments are free vectors, which you may draw the circular
arrow anywhere you like on the body. In other words, moving a concentrated
moment from one point to another is an equivalent transformation. Remember,
this equivalence only applies to the external effects. What happens inside the
body definitely does depend on the specific point where the moment is applied.

Adding moments to produce a resultant moment. If more than one
couple-moment or concentrated moment acts on an object, the situation may be
simplified by adding them together to produce one resultant moment,MR. The
standard rules of vector addition apply.

    In two-dimensional problems, moments are either clockwise or counterclock-
wise, so they may be considered scalar values and added algebraically. Give
counterclockwise moments a positive sign and clockwise moments a negative
sign according to the right-hand rule sign convention. If this is done, the sign
of the resultant moment will indicate the direction of the net moment. You can
use the right-hand rule to establish the direction of the moment vector, which
will point into or out of the page.

                                            MR = M

    Example 4.6.5 Equivalent Moment.

        Two concentrated moments and a couple
   act on the object shown. Given: M1 = 400 N·
   m, M2 = 200 N·m, F = 40 N, and d = 2 m.

        Replace these with a single, equivalent
   concentrated moment, and give the magni-
   tude and direction of your result.

    Solution. First, replace the couple with an equivalent couple, M3, the
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  163

magnitude of which is

                                     M3 = F d
                                          = F d sin 60
                                          = 69.3 N·m

By observation, this is a counterclockwise moment, as is M2. M1 is clock-
wise. Summing the scalar magnitudes gives the resultant moment. The
signs of the terms are assigned according to the sign convention: positive
if counterclockwise, negative if clockwise.

MR = M
     = M1 + M2 + M3
     = -400 N·m + 200 N·m + 69.3 N·m
     = -130.7 N·m

MR = 130.7 N·m clockwise

Resolving a moment into components. For three-dimensional moment
vectors, another potential equivalent transformation is to resolve a moment vec-
tor into components. These may be orthogonal components in the x, y, and z
directions, or components in a plane and perpendicular to it, or components in
some other rotated coordinate system.

4.7 Statically Equivalent Systems
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  164

    Key Questions

       · What is an equivalent system?

       · What is a resultant force?

       · What is a resultant moment?

       · Do you have to include both r × F moments and couples to find the
           resultant moment?

       · How can you find the simplest equivalent system?

       · When will the simplest equivalent system be a wrench?

       · How can you determine if two loading systems are statically equiva-
           lent?

    A loading system is a combination of load forces and moments that act on an
object. It can be as simple as a single force, or as complex as a three-dimensional
combination of many force and moment vectors.

    You will see that any loading systems may be replaced with a simpler stati-
cally equivalent system consisting of one resultant force at a specific point and one
resultant moment by performing a series of equivalent transformations. Force
system resultants provide a convenient representation for complex force interac-
tions at engineering connections that we will rely on later in a variety of contexts.
For now, we will focus on the details of reducing a system to a single force and
couple.

    Depending on the original loading system, the resultant force, the resultant
moment, or both may be zero. If they are both zero, it indicates that the object
is in equilibrium under this load condition. If they are non-zero, the supports will
need to provide an equal and opposite reaction to put the object into equilibrium.

    The resultant force acting on a system, R, can be found from adding the
individual forces, Fi, such that

                               R = F = F1 + F2 + F3 + ....

    The resultant moment, MO, about a point O, can be found from adding
all of the moments M, about that point, including both r × F moments and
concentrated moments.

                            MO = Mi = M1 + M2 + M3 + ...

    It is often more convenient to work with the scalar components of the resul-
tant vectors since they separate the effects in the three coordinate directions.

Rx = Fx  MOx = Mx
Ry = Fy  MOy = My

Figure 4.7.1 Statically equivalent systems

Force-Couple Systems. One transformation you might want to make is to
move a force to another location. While sliding a force along its line of action
is fine, moving a force to another point changes its line of action and thus its
rotational effect on the object, so moving a force to a new line of action is not
an equivalent transformation.

    Consider the cantilever beam below. In diagram (a), the load P is at the end
of the beam, and in (b) it has been moved to the center. The external effects are
shown in (c) and (d). Although the vertical reaction force is the P in both cases,
the reaction moment at point O is 2P  in the first case and P  in the second.

Figure 4.7.2 Moving a force is not an equivalent transformation

    You can move a force to a new line of action in an equivalent fashion if you
add a "compensatory couple" to undo the effect of changing the line of action.
This can be accomplished with a series of individual equivalent transformations
as shown in the diagram below. To move P to another location, first add two
equal and opposite forces where you want the force to be, as in (b). Then
recognize the couple you have formed (c), and replace it with an equivalent
couple-moment. The result of this process is the equivalent force-couple system
shown in diagram (d), which is statically equivalent to the original situation in
(a).

                                                            with the same reactions as Fig-
                                                            ure 4.7.2(c).

    Evaluating the moment at point O was an arbitrary choice. Any other point
would give the same result. For example, in the original situation (a) force P
makes a clockwise moment M = P  about the midpoint. When the force is
moved to the center P creates no moment there, so a clockwise compensatory
couple with a magnitude of P  must be added to maintain equivalence. This
is the same result as we found previously (d). The compensatory couple has
been drawn centered around the midpoint, but this too is arbitrary because
concentrated moments are free vectors and can be placed at any location.

Reduction of a complex system. Any loading system can be reduced to a
statically equivalent system consisting of single force and a single moment at a
specified point with the following procedure:

   1. Determine the resultant moment about the specified point by considering
       all forces and concentrated moments on the original system.

2. Determine the resultant force by adding all forces acting on the original
   system.

3. Determine the resultant moment about a point in the original system

4. Create the statically equivalent system by replacing all loads with the
   resultant force and the resultant moment at the selected point.

Example 4.7.4 Eccentric loading.

    An vertical column is supporting an ec-        1200 lb  P
centric load as shown.                       9 in               M

    Replace this load with an equivalent
force-couple system acting at the center of
the beam's top surface.

Solution. In order to move the vertical force 9 in to the left, a clockwise
couple M must be added to maintain equivalence, where

                                  M = Pd
                                      = (1200 lb)(9 in)
                                      = 10800 in·lb
                                      = 900 ft·lb

Example 4.7.5 Equivalent Force-couple System.

a. Replace the system of forces in diagram (a) with an equivalent force-
   couple system at point A.

b. Replace this force-couple system with a single equivalent force and
   specify its location.

Figure 4.7.6

Solution. The original system is shown in (a).

Since the F1 and F2 are parallel, the magnitude of the resultant force is
just the sum of the two magnitudes and it points down.

                                       R = F1 + F2
The resultant moment about point A is

                              MA = F1d1 + F2(d1 + d2).

To create the equivalent system (b), the resultant force and resultant mo-
ment are placed at point A.
The system in (b) can be further simplified to eliminate the moment at
MA, by performing the process in reverse.
In (c) we place the resultant force R a distance d away from point A
such that the resultant moment around point A remains the same. This
distance can be found using M = F d.

                                        d = MA/R
The systems in (a), (b), and (c) are all statically equivalent

In this example, we started with two forces. We have found two different stati-
cally equivalent systems; one with a force and a couple, the other with a single
force. This latter system is simpler than the original system.

    It is important to note that static equivalence applies to external effects
only. When determining internal forces, such as the shear and bending moment
discussed in Section 8.4 or when considering non-rigid bodies, the original loading
system must be used.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE                            169

Determining Equivalence. Two complex loading systems are equivalent if
they reduce to the same resultant force and the same resultant moment about
any arbitrary point.

    Two loading systems are statically equivalent if

   · The resultant forces are the equal

   · The resultant moments about some point are equal

    This process is illustrated in the following example.

Example 4.7.7 Finding Statically Equivalent Loads.
Which of the three loading systems shown are statically equivalent?

Figure 4.7.8

Solution.

1. Strategy.

   Evaluate the resultant force and resultant moment for each case and
   compare. We choose to evaluate the resultant moment about point
   A, though any other point would work.

2. For system (a).

                           R = -10, 0 lb
                         MA = -80 + 6(10)

                              = -20 ft·lb

3. For system (b).

                         R = -20 + 10, 0 lb
                            = -10, 0 lb
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE       170

                    MA = -120 + 12(20) - 6(10)
                         = 60 ft·lb

4. For system (c).

                                          R = -10, 0 lb
                                       MA = -40 + 20 + 0(10)

                                             = -20 ft·lb

    Systems (a) and (c) are statically equivalent since R and MA are the same
    in both cases. System (b) is not as its resultant moment is different than
    the other two.

    Any load system can be simplified to its resultant force R, and resultant
couple M, acting at any arbitrary point O. There are four common special cases,
which are worth highlighting individually.

Concurrent forces. When all forces in a system are concurrent, the resultant
moment about their common intersection point will always be zero. We then
need only find the resultant force and place it at the point of intersection. The
resultant moment about any other point is the moment of the resultant force R
about that point.

Parallel forces. When all forces in a system are parallel, the resultant force
will act in this direction with a magnitude equal to the sum of the individual
magnitudes. There will be no moment created about this axis, but we need to
find the resultant moment about the other two rectangular axes. That is, if
all forces act in the x direction, we need only find the resultant force in the x
direction and the resultant moment about the y and z axes.

Coplanar forces. When all forces in a system are coplanar we need only
find the resultant force in this plane and the resultant moment about the axis
perpendicular to this plane. That is, if all forces exist in the x-y plane, we
need only to sum components in the x and y directions to find resultant force
R, and use these to determine the resultant moment about the z axis. All
two-dimensional problems fall into this category.

Wrench resultant. A wrench resultant is a special case where the resultant
moment acts around the axis of the resultant force. The directions of the resul-
tant force vector and the resultant moment vector are the same.
CHAPTER 4. MOMENTS AND STATIC EQUIVALENCE  171

Figure 4.7.9                For example, if the resultant force is only in the x di-
Resultant              rection and the resultant moment acts only around the
                       x axis, this is an example of a wrench resultant. An
                       everyday example is a screwdriver, where both the re-
                       sultant force and axis of rotation are in-line with the
                       screwdriver. A wrench resultant is considered positive if
              Wrenchthe couple vector and force vector point in the same di-
                       rection, and negative if they point in opposite directions.

    Any three-dimensional force-couple system may be reduced to an equivalent
wrench resultant even if the resultant force and resultant moment do not initially
form a wrench resultant.

    To find the equivalent wrench resultant:

1. First, find the resultant force R and resultant moment M at an arbitrary
   at arbitrary point, O. These need not act along the same axis.

2. Resolve the resultant moment into scalar components M and M, parallel
   and perpendicular to the axis of the resultant force.

3. Eliminate M by moving the resultant force away from point O by distance
   d = M/R

    The simplified system consists of moment M and force R and acting distance
d away from point O. Since R and M act along the same axis, the system has
been reduced to a wrench resultant. Wrench resultants are the most general way

to represent a complex force-couple system, but their utility is limited.

Rigid Body Equilibrium

This chapter will investigate the equilibrium of simple rigid bodies like your

book, phone, or pencil. The important difference between rigid bodies and the

particles of Chapter 3 is that rigid bodies have the potential to rotate around a

point or axis, while particles do not.

For rigid body equilibrium, we need to maintain translational equilibrium

with

                                          F=0   (5.0.1)

and also maintain a balance of rotational forces and couple-moments with a new

equilibrium equation

                                        M = 0.  (5.0.2)

5.1 Degree of Freedom

Degrees of freedom refers to the number of independent parameters or values
required to specify the state of an object.

    The state of a particle is completely specified by its location in space, while
the state of a rigid body includes its location in space and also its orientation.

    Two-dimensional rigid bodies in       Figure 5.1.1 Two-dimensional rigid
the xy plane have three degrees of free-  bodies have three degrees of freedom.
dom. Position can be characterized
by the x and y coordinates of a point
on the object and orientation by angle
z about an axis perpendicular to the
plane. The complete movement of the
body can be defined by two linear dis-
placements x and y, and one angu-
lar displacement z.

CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM  175

    Three-dimensional rigid bodies
have six degrees of freedom, which
can be specified with three orthogonal
coordinates x, y and z, and three
angles of rotation, x, y and z.
Movement of the body is defined by
three translations x, y and z,
and three rotations x, y and z.

                                                     Figure 5.1.2 Three-dimensional rigid
                                                     body have six degrees of freedom -
                                                     three translations and three rotations.
    For a body to be in static equilibrium, all possible movements must be ad-
equately restrained. If a degree of freedom is not restrained, the body is in an
unstable state, free to move in one or more ways. Stability is highly desirable
for reasons of human safety, and bodies are often restrained by redundant re-
straints so that if one were to fail, the body would still remain stable. If the
restraints correctly interpreted, then equal constraints and degrees of freedom
create a stable system, and the values of the reaction forces and moments can
be determined using equilibrium equations. If the number of restraints exceeds
the number of degrees of freedom, the body is in equilibrium but you will need
techniques we won't cover in statics to determine the reactions.

5.2 Free-Body Diagrams

    Key Questions

       · What are the five steps to create a free-body diagram?

       · What are degrees of freedom, and how do they relate to stability?

       · Which reaction forces and couple-moments come from each support
           type?

       · What are the typical support force components and couple-moment
           components that can be modeled from the various types of supports?

    Free body diagrams are the tool that engineers use to identify the forces and
moments that influence an object. They will be used extensively in statics, and
you will use them again in other engineering courses so your effort to master
them now is worthwhile. Although the concept is simple, students often need
help to draw them correctly.

    Drawing a correct free-body diagram is the first and most important step
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM  176

in the process of solving an equilibrium problem. It is the basis for all the
equilibrium equations you will write; if your free-body diagram is incorrect, your
equations, analysis, and solutions will also be wrong.

    A quality free-body diagram is neat, clearly drawn, and contains all the
information necessary to solve the equilibrium. You should take your time and
think carefully about the free-body diagram before you begin to write and solve
equations. A straightedge, protractor and colored pencils all can help. You will
inevitably make mistakes that will lead to confusion or incorrect answers; you
are encouraged to think about these errors and identify any misunderstandings
to avoid them in the future.

    Every equilibrium problem begins by drawing and labeling a free-body diagram!

Creating Free Body Diagrams. The basic process for drawing a free-body
diagrams is

   1. Select and isolate an object.

       The "free-body" in free-body diagram means that the body to be analyzed
       must be free from the supports that are physically holding it in place.

       Simply sketch a quick outline of the object as if it is floating in space
       disconnected from everything. Do not draw free-body diagram forces on
       top of your problem drawing -- the body needs to be drawn free of its
       supports.

   2. Select a reference frame.

       Select a right-handed coordinate system to use as a reference for your
       equilibrium equations. Even if you are using a horizontal x axis and vertical
       y axis, indicate your coordinate system on your diagram.

       Look ahead and select a coordinate system that minimizes the number of
       unknown force components in your equations. The choice is technically
       arbitrary, but a good choice will simplify your calculations and reduce
       your effort. If you and another student pick different reference systems,
       you should both get the same answer while expressing your work with
       different components.

   3. Identify all loads.

       Add vector arrows representing the applied forces and couple moments of
       acting on the body. These are often obvious. Include the body's weight
       if it is non-negligible. If a vector has a known line of action, draw the
       arrow in that direction; if its sense is unknown, assume one. Every vector
       should have a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead indicating
       its direction.

   4. Identify all reactions.
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM  177

       Traverse the perimeter of the object and wherever a support was removed
       when isolating the body, replace it with the forces and/or couple-moments
       which it provides. Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and
       a clear arrowhead. Again, if a vector's direction is unknown just assume
       one.

       The reaction forces and moments provided by common two-dimensional
       supports are shown in Figure 5.2.1 and three dimensional support in Fig-
       ure 5.2.2. Identifying the correct reaction forces and couple-moments com-
       ing from supports is perhaps the most challenging step in the entire equi-
       librium process.

   5. Label the diagram.

       Verify that every dimension, angle, force, and moment is labeled with
       either a value or a symbolic name if the value is unknown. Supply the
       information needed for your calculations, but don't clutter the diagram
       up with unneeded information. This diagram should be a stand-alone
       presentation.

    Drawing good free-body diagrams is surprisingly tricky and requires practice.
Study the examples, think hard about them, do lots of problems, and learn from
your errors.

Two-dimensional Reactions. Supports supply reaction forces and moment
which prevent bodies from moving when loaded. In the most basic terms, forces
prevent translation, and moments prevent rotation.

    The reactions supplied by a support depend on the nature of the particular
support. For example in a top view, a door hinge allows the door to rotate
freely but prevents it from translating. We model this as a frictionless pin that
supplies a perpendicular pair of reaction forces, but no reaction moment. We
can evaluate all the other physical supports in a similar way to come up with the
table below. You will notice that some two-dimensional supports only restrain
one degree of freedom and others restrain up to three degrees of freedom. The
number of degrees of freedom directly correlates to the number of unknowns
created by the support.

    The table below shows typical two-dimensional support methods and the
corresponding reaction forces and moments supplied each.

Three-dimensional Reactions. The main added complexity with three-dimensional
objects is that there are more possible ways the object can move, and also more
possible ways to restrain it. The table below show the types of supports which
are available and the corresponding reaction forces and moment. As before, your
free-body diagrams should show the reactions supplied by the constraints, not
the constraints themselves.

reactions.

    One new issue we face in three-dimensional problems is that reaction couples
may be available but not engaged.

    A support which provides a non-zero reaction is said to be engaged. Picture
a crate sitting at rest on a horizontal surface with a cable attached to the top
of the crate. If the cable is slack, the reaction of the cable would be available
but not engaged. Instead, the floor would be supporting the full weight of the
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM             180

crate. If we were to remove the floor, the cable would be engaged and support
the weight of the crate.

Figure 5.2.3 Available and Engaged reactions.

    To get a feel for how reaction couples engage, pick up your laptop or a
heavy book and hold it horizontally with your left hand. Can you feel your
hand supplying an upward force to support the weight and a counter-clockwise
reaction couple to keep it horizontal? Now add a similar support by gripping
with your right hand. How do the forces and couple-moments change? You
should have felt the force of your left hand decrease as your right hand picked
up half the weight, and also noticed that the reaction couple from your left hand
was no longer needed.

Figure 5.2.4 One hand holding an object versus two hands holding the same
object.

    The vertical force in your right hand engaged instead of the couple-moment
of your left hand. The reaction couples from both hands are available, but the
vertical forces engage first and are sufficient for equilibrium. This phenomena is
described by the saying "reaction forces engage before reaction couple-moments".

Free-Body Diagram Examples. Given that there several options for repre-
senting reaction forces and couple-moments from a support, there are different,
equally valid options for drawing free-body diagrams. With experience you will
learn which representation to choose to simplify the equilibrium calculations.

    Possible free-body diagrams for two common situations are shown in the next
two examples.

Solution.

    Begin by drawing a neat rec-                        B 30°D
tangle to represent the beam dis-                                         C
connected from its supports, then
add all the known forces and couple-
moments. Label the magnitudes of
the loads and the known dimensions
symbolically.

Choose the standard xy coordinate system, since it aligns well with the
forces.
The wall at A is a fixed support which prevents the beam from translating
up, down, left or right, or rotating in the plane of the page. These con-
straints are represented by two perpendicular forces and a concentrated
moment, as shown in Figure 5.2.1. Label these unknowns as well.
The knowns in this problem are the magnitudes and directions of moment
C, forces B, and D and the dimensions of the beam. The unknowns are
the two force components Ax and Ay and the scalar moment MA caused
by the fixed connection. If you prefer, you may represent force A as a
force of unknown magnitude acting at an unknown direction. Whether
you represent it as x and y components or as a magnitude and direction,
there are two unknowns associated with force A.
The three unknown reactions can be found using the three independent
equations of equilibrium we will discuss later in this chapter.

    The beam is supported by a fric-     12 kN
tionless pin at A and a rocker at D.

Solution. In this problem, the knowns are the magnitude and direction
of force B and moment C and the dimensions of the beam.
The constraints are the frictionless pin at A and the rocker at D. The
pin prevents translation but not rotation, which means two it has two
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM                                        182

unknowns, represented by either magnitude and direction, or by two or-
thogonal components. The rocker provides a force perpendicular to the
surface it rests on, which is 30 from the horizontal. This means that the
line of action of force D is 30 from the vertical, giving us its direction but
not its sense or magnitude

the dimensions.

Add forces Ax and Ay representing vector A and force D at D, acting 30
from the vertical.
When a force has a known line of action as with force D, draw it acting
along that line; don't break it into components. When it is not obvious
which way a reaction force actually points along its lines of action, just
make your best guess and place an arrowhead accordingly. Your calcula-
tions will confirm or refute your guess later.

As in the previous example, you

could alternately represent force A          B
                                                                 C

so in this case.

5.3 Equations of Equilibrium

Key Questions

   · What is the definition of static equilibrium?

   · How do I choose which are the most efficient equations to solve two-
       dimensional equilibrium problems?

    In statics, our focus is on systems where both linear acceleration a and angu-
lar acceleration  are zero. These systems are frequently stationary, but could
be moving with constant velocity.

    Under these conditions Newton's Second Law for translation reduces to

                                     F = 0,                         (5.3.1)

and, Newton's second law for rotation gives the similar equation

                  M = 0.                                            (5.3.2)
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM                              183

The first of these equations requires that all forces acting on an object balance

and cancel each other out, and the second requires that all moments balance as

well. Together, these two equations are the mathematical basis of this course

and are sufficient to evaluate equilibrium for systems with up to six degrees of

freedom.

These are vector equations; hidden within each are three independent scalar

equations, one for each coordinate direction.

                                                               (5.3.3)
                         Fx = 0                     Mx = 0
          F = 0 = Fy = 0            M = 0 = My = 0

                            Fz = 0                     Mz = 0

Working with these scalar equations is often easier than using their vector equiv-
alents, particularly in two-dimensional problems.

    In many cases we do not need all six equations. We saw in Chapter 3 that
particle equilibrium problems can be solved using the force equilibrium equation
alone, because particles have, at most, three degrees of freedom and are not
subject to any rotation.

    To analyze rigid bodies, which can rotate as well as translate, the mo-
ment equations are needed to address the additional degrees of freedom. Two-
dimensional rigid bodies have only one degree of rotational freedom, so they
can be solved using just one moment equilibrium equation, but to solve three-
dimensional rigid bodies, which have six degrees of freedom, all three moment
equations and all three force equations are required.

5.4 2D Rigid Body Equilibrium

Two-dimensional rigid bodies have three degrees of freedom, so they only require
three independent equilibrium equations to solve. The six scalar equations of
(5.3.3) can easily be reduced to three by eliminating the equations which refer
to the unused z dimension. For objects in the xy plane there are no forces acting
in the z direction to create moments about the x or y axes, so the reduced set
of three equations is

                                              
                                               Fx = 0
                                     {1} =  Fy = 0

                                                    MA = 0

where the subscript z has been replaced with a letter to indicate an arbitrary
moment center in the xy plane instead of a perpendicular z axis.

    This is not the only possible set of equilibrium equations. Either force equa-
tion can be replaced with a linearly independent moment equation about a point
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM                                         184

of your choosing 1, so the other possible sets are

                                                            
 Fx = 0                MC = 0                                MC = 0
                                                    {4} =  MB = 0
{2} =  MB = 0         {3} =  Fy = 0
              MA = 0                MA = 0                        MA = 0

For set four, moment centers A, B, and C must form a triangle to ensure the
three equations are linearly independent.

    You have a lot of flexibility when solving rigid-body equilibrium problems. In
addition to choosing which set of equations to use, you are also free to rotate the
coordinate system to any orientation you like, pick different points for moment
centers, and solve the equations in any order or simultaneously.

    This freedom raises several questions. Which equation set should you choose?
Is one choice `better' than another? Why bother rotating coordinate systems?
How do you select moment centers? Students want to know "how to solve the
problem," when in reality there are many ways to do it.

    The actual task is to choose an efficient approach and carry it out. An efficient
solution is one which avoids mathematical complications and makes the problem
easy to solve. Complications include unpleasant geometries, unnecessary algebra,
and particularly simultaneous equations, which are algebra intensive and error
prone.

    So how do you set up an efficient approach? First, stop, think, and look for
opportunities to make the solution more efficient. Here are some recommenda-
tions.

1. Equation set one is usually a good choice and should be considered first.

2. Inspect your free-body diagram and identify the unknown values in the
   problem. These may be magnitudes, directions, angles or dimensions.

3. Align the coordinate system with at least one unknown force.

4. Take moments about the point where the lines of action of two unknown
   forces intersect, which eliminates them from the equation.

5. Solve equations with one unknown first.

    1Labels A, B and C in these equations are representative. They don't have to correspond
to points A, B and C on your problem.
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM                                                    185

Example 5.4.1 Pin and Roller.

    The L-shaped body is sup-                                250 lb  4 ft

ports a 250 lb vertical force at C           60° B  C                             1.5 ft
and a 500 ft·lb couple-moment at                                                     D
D. Determine the reactions at A                                      500 ft-lb
and B.                                                                         A  1.5 ft

This problem will be solved three different ways to demonstrate the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of different approaches.

Solution 1.

    Solutions always start with a                      250 lb

free-body diagram, showing all                      C
forces and moments acting on the 60°
object. Here, the known loads B                                      500 ft-lb    D

C = 250 lb (down) and D =

500 ft·lb (CCW) are red, and the
unknown reactions Ax, Ay and B
are blue.

The force at B is drawn along its known line-of-action perpendicular to
the roller surface, and drawn pointing up and right because that will op-
pose the rotation of the frame about A caused by load C and moment D.
The force at A is represented by unknown components Ax and Ay. The
sense of these components is unknown, so we have arbitrarily assigned the
arrowheads pointing left and up.
We have chosen the standard coordinate system with positive x to the
right and positive y pointing up, and resolved force A into components in
the x and y directions.
The magnitude of force B is unknown but its direction is known, so the x
and y components of B can be expressed as

Bx = B sin 60                                By = B cos 60

.

We choose to solve equation set {A}, and choose to take moments about
point A, because unknowns Ax and Ay intersect there. Substituting the
variables into the equation and solving for the unknowns gives

                                     Fx = 0

Bx - Ax = 0

                                     Ax = B sin 60                   (1)
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM          186

Fy = 0

By - C + Ay = 0

Ay = C - B cos 60                     (2)

MA = 0

-Bx(3) - By(7) + C(4) + D = 0

3B cos 60 + 7B sin 60 = 4C + D

B(3 sin 60 + 7 cos 60) = 4C + D

B=  4C + D                            (3)

                               6.098

Of these three equations only the third can be evaluated immediately,

because we know C and D. In equations (1) and (2) unknowns Ax and
Ay can't be found until B is known. Inserting the known values into (3)
and solving for B gives

      4(250) + 500
B=

           6.098
   = 1500 ft·lb

        6.098 ft

   = 246.0 lb

Now with the magnitude of B known, Ax and Ay can be found with (1)
and (2).

Ax = B sin 60
    = 246.0 sin 60
    = 213.0 lb

                               Ay = C - B cos 60
                                    = 250 - 246.0 cos 60
                                    = 127.0 lb

The positive signs on these values indicate that the directions assumed on
the free-body diagram were correct.
The magnitude and direction of force A can be found from the scalar
components Ax and Ay using a rectangular to polar conversion.

                                                                  Ax

The final values for A and B, with angles measured counter-clockwise from
the positive x axis are

                                A = 248.0 lb  149.2,

                                  B = 246.0 lb  30°.
This solution demonstrates a fairly standard approach appropriate for
many statics problems which should be considered whenever the free-body
diagram contains a frictionless pin. Start by taking moments there.
Solution 2.

In this solution, we have ro-                                     250 lb

tated the coordinate system 30             60°

to align it with force B and also          B                   C

chosen the components of force A                                          500 ft-lb  D

to align with the new coordinate                                  30°

system.

There is no particular advantage to this approach over the first one, but
with two unknown forces aligned with the x direction, Ay can be found
directly after breaking force C into components.

                                   Fx = 0

         B - Cx + Ax = 0

                                Ax = -B + C sin 30                        (1)

                                   Fy = 0

         -Cy + Ay = 0

                                   Ay = C cos 30                          (2)

                                         MA = 0

         -Bx(3) - By(7) + C(4) + D = 0
                3B cos 60 + 7B sin 60 = 4C + D
                B(3 cos 60 + 7 sin 60) = 4C + D
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM                                        188

                                    B=  4C + D             (3)

                                        7.56

Solving equation (2) yields

                             Ay = 216.5 lb.

Solving equation (3) yields the same result as previously

                             B = 246.0 lb.

Substituting B and C into equation (1) yields

          Ax = -B + C sin 30
               = -246.0 + 250 sin 30
               = -121.0 lb

The negative sign on this result indicates that our assumed direction for
Ax was incorrect, and that force actually points 180 to the assumed
direction.
Resolving the Ax and Ay gives the magnitude and direction of force A.

                                    A = A2x + A2y = 248.0 lb

                                         = tan-1 Ay = 60.8
                                                      Ax

                                     = 180 - ( - 30) = 149.2

Again, the final values for A and B, with angles measured counter-
clockwise from the positive x axis are

                                A = 248.0 lb  149.2,

                                   B = 246.0 lb  30°
This approach was slightly more difficult than solution one because of
the additional trigonometry involved to find components in the rotated
coordinate system.
Solution 3.

                                                   250 lb

For this solution, we will use          60°

the same free-body diagram as so-       B       C

lution one, but will use three mo-                         500 ft-lb  D

ment equations, about points B,

C and D.

                         MB = 0

-Ax(3) + Ay(7) - C(3) + D = 0

           -3Ax + 7Ay = 250                                   (1)

                         MC = 0

-Ax(3) + Ay(4) - By(3) + D = 0

-3Ax + 4Ay - 3B cos 60 = -D

        3Ax - 4Ay + 1.5B = 500                                (2)

                         MD = 0

-Ax(1.5) - Bx(1.5) - By(7) + C(4) + D = 0

1.5Ax + 1.5B sin 60 + 7B cos 60 = 4C + D

        1.5Ax + 4.799B = 1500                                 (3)

This set of three equations and three unknowns can be solved with some
algebra.
Adding (1) and (2) gives

3Ay + 1.5B = 750                           (4)

Dividing equation (2) by 2 and subtracting it from (3) gives

2Ay + 4.049B = 1250                        (5)

Multiplying (4) by 2/3 and subtracting from (5) eliminates Ay and gives

        3.049B = 750

        B = 246.0 lb

, the same result as before.

Substituting B into (3) gives Ax = 213.0 lb, and substituting this into (1)
gives Ay = 127.0 lb, again the same result as before.
An alternate approach is to set these three equations up for a matrix

solution and use technology to do the algebra, as done here with Sage.

                     
  -3 7  0            Ax            250

 3 -4   1.5  Ay =  500 

1.5 0 4.799 B                      1500
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM  190

 A = Matrix([[-3,7,0],[3,-4, 1.5],[1.5,0,4.799]])
 B = vector([250, 500, 1500])
 x = A.solve_right(B)
 x

 (213.020662512299, 127.008855362414, 245.982289275172)

This is a good example of an inefficient solution because of all the algebra
involved. The issue here was the poor choice of B, C and D as moment
centers. Whenever possible you should take moments about a point where
the line of action of two unknowns intersect as was done in solution one.
This gives a moment equation which can be solved immediately for the
third unknown.

5.5 3D Rigid Body Equilibrium

   Key Questions

       · What are the similarities and differences between solving two-
           dimensional and three-dimensional equilibrium problems?

       · Why are some three-dimensional reaction couple-moments "available
           but not engaged"?

       · What kinds of problems are solvable using linear algebra?

    Three-dimensional systems are closer to reality than two-dimensional sys-
tems and the basic principles to solving both are the same, however they are
generally harder solve because of the additional degrees of freedom involved and
the difficulty visualizing and determining distances, forces and moments in three
dimensions.

    Three-dimensional problems are usually solved using vector algebra rather
than the scalar approach used in the last section. The main differences are that
directions are described with unit vectors rather than with angles, and moments
are determined using the vector cross product rather scalar methods. Because
they have more possible unknowns it is harder to find efficient equations to solve
by hand. A problem might involve solving a system of up to six equations and
six unknowns, in which case it is best solved using linear algebra and technology.

Resolving Forces and Moments into Components. To break two-dimensional
forces into components, you likely used right-triangle trigonometry, sine and
cosine. However, three-dimensional forces will likely need to be broken into
components using Section 2.5.
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM  191

    When summing moments, make sure to consider both the r × F moments
and also the couple-moments with the following guidance:

   1. First, choose any point in the system to sum moments around.

   2. There are two general methods for summing the r × F moments. Both
       techniques will give you the same set of equations.

        (a) Sum moments around each axis.
              For relatively simple systems with few position and force vector com-
              ponents, you can find the cross product for each non-parallel position
              and force pair. Using this method requires you to resolve the direc-
              tion of each cross product pair using the right-hand rule as covered
              in Chapter 4. Recall that there are up to six pairs of non-parallel
              components that you need to consider.

        (b) Sum all moments around a point using vector determinants.
              Choose a point in the system which is on the line of action of as many
              forces as possible, then set up each cross product as a determinant.
              After computing the components coming from each determinant, com-
              bine the x, y, and z terms into each of the Mx = 0, My = 0, and
              Mz = 0 equations.

   3. Finally, add the components of any couple-moments into the corresponding
       Mx = 0, My = 0, and Mz = 0 equations.

    Solving for unknown values in equilibrium equations. Once you have
    formulated F = 0 and M = 0 equations in each of the x, y and z directions,
    you could be facing up to six equations and six unknown values.

         Frequently these simultaneous equation sets can be solved with substitution,
    but it is often be easier to solve large equation sets with linear algebra. Note that
    the adjective "linear" specifies that the unknown values must be linear terms,
    which means that each unknown variable cannot be raised to a exponent, be an
    exponent, or buried inside of a sin or cos function. Luckily, most unknowns in
    equilibrium are linear terms, except for unknown angles. If you are not familiar
    with the use of linear algebra matrices to solve simultaneously equations, search
    the internet for Solving Systems of Equations Using Linear Algebra and you will
    find plenty of resources.

         No matter how you choose to solve for the unknown values, any numeric
    values which come out to be negative indicate that your initial hypothesis of
    that vector's sense was incorrect.

Example 5.5.1 3D Bent Bar.

The bent bar shown is held in a horizontal plane by a fixed connection at
C while cable AB exerts a 500 lb force on point A.
Given A = (4, 4, 5)B = (6, 0, 4) and C = (0, 4, 0).

                                                                      y

Find the reaction force C and concentrated moment M with components

dition.

Solution.

   1. Draw a free-body diagram.
       As always, begin by drawing a free-body diagram.

                                         y

                                   z           x

                                                    F

                                                                    B

2. Determine the force acting at point A in Cartesian form.
   The force of the cable acts from A to B. This direction is described
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM                           193

by the displacement vector from A to B

rAB = (2i - 4j - 1k) ft

or the corresponding unit vector

AB = rAB
         |rAB |

   = 2i - 4j - 1k
         (2)2 + (-4)2 + (-1)2

   2i - 4j - 1k
   =                               .
                 21

Multiplying the unit vector by the cable tension gives the force acting
on A as a three-dimensional Cartesian force vector.

F = ABT

   2i - 4j - 1k                       500 lb
=                                     500
                 21                    lb

= (2i - 4j - 1k)                        21

F = (218i - 436j - 109k) lb

3. Determine the moment about C.

   The moment about point C is found with the cross product (4.3.4)
   where the moment arm is the displacement vector from C to A.

rCA = (4i + 0j + 5k) ft

                             MC = rCA × F
                                       i j k 500

                                   =4 0 5 
                                       2 -4 -1 21

F = 0                              Cx + Fx = 0
       Fx = 0 :                    Cx = -218 lb

         Ty = 0 :
       
       
       Tz = 0 :
       

M = 0                              Mx + MC x = 0
       Mx = 0 :                    Mx = -2182 ft·lb
                                   My + MC y = 0
                                   My = -1528 ft·lb
                                   Mz + MC z = 0
                                   Mz = +1746 ft·lb
         My = 0 :
       
       
       Mz = 0 :
       

The resulting vector equations for the reaction force C and reaction
moment M are

                    C = (-218i + 436j + 109k) lb
                    M = (-2182i - 1528j + 1746k) ft·lb.

5.6 Stability and Determinacy

   Key Questions
       · What does stable mean for a rigid body?
       · What does determinate mean for a rigid body?
       · Does stability depend on the external loads or only on the reactions?
       · How can I tell if a system is determinate?
       · How can I decide if a problem is both stable and determinate, which
           makes it solvable statics?

Determinate vs. Indeterminate. A static system is determinate if it is
possible to find the unknown reactions using the methods of statics, that is, by
using equilibrium equations, otherwise it is indeterminate.
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM  195

    In order for a system to be determinate the number of unknown force and
moment reaction components must be less than or equal to the number of inde-
pendent equations of equilibrium available. Each equilibrium equation derives
from a degree of freedom of the system, so there may be no more unknowns
than degrees of freedom. This means that we can determine no more than three
unknown reaction components in two-dimensional systems and no more than six
in three-dimensional systems.

    An indeterminate system with fewer reaction components than degrees of
freedom is under-constrained and therefore unstable. On the other hand,
if there are more reaction components than degrees of freedom, the system is
both over-constrained and indeterminate. In terms of force and moment
equations, there are more unknowns than equilibrium equations so they can't all
be determined. This is not to say that it is impossible to find all reaction force
on an over-constrained system, just that you will not learn how to find them in
this course.

Stable vs. Unstable. A body in equilibrium is held in position by its sup-
ports, which restrict the body's motion and counteract the applied loads. When
there are sufficient supports to restrain a body from moving, we say that the
body is stable. A stable body is prevented from translating and rotating in
all directions. A body which can move is unstable even if it is not currently
moving, because the slightest change in load may take it out of equilibrium and
initiate motion. Stability is loading independent i.e. a stable body is stable for
any loading condition.

Rules to Validate a Stable and Determinate System. There are three
rules to determine if a system is both stable and determinate. While, the rules
below can technically be checked in any order, they have been sorted from the
quickest to the most time consuming to speed up your analysis.

    Rule 1: Are there ex-
actly three reaction compo-
nents on a two-dimensional
body?

    If YES, the system is de-
terminate.

    If NO, the system is in-
determinate or not stable.
CHAPTER 5. RIGID BODY EQUILIBRIUM    196

    Rule 2: Are all the reac-
tion force components paral-
lel to one another?

    If YES, the system is un-
stable for translation.

    If NO, the system is sta-
ble for translation.

    Rule 3: Do the lines of
action of the reaction forces
intersect at a single point?

    If YES, the system is un-
stable for rotation about the
single intersection point.

    If NO, the system is sta-
ble for rotation.

You can use these interactives to explore how the reactions supporting rigid
bodies are affected by the loads applied. You can use the equations of equilibrium
to solve for the unknown reactions, and check your work.

Equilibrium of Structures

In this chapter, you will conduct static analysis of multi-body structures. Broadly
defined, a structure is any set of interconnected rigid bodies designed to serve a
purpose. The parts of the structure may move relative to one another, like the
blades of scissors, or they may be fixed relative to one another, like the structural
members of a bridge.

    Analysis of structures involves determining all forces acting on and between
individual members of the structure. Fundamentally there is nothing new here;
the techniques you have already learned apply, however, structures tend to have
more unknown forces, and so are more involved and provide more opportunities
for error than the problems you have previously encountered. Correct free-body
diagrams and careful work are required, as always.

6.1 Structures

Structures fall into three broad categories: trusses, frames, and machines, and
you should be able to identify which is which.

    A truss is a multi-body structure made up of long slender members con-
nected at their ends in triangular subunits. Truss members carry axial forces
only. Trusses are commonly used for spanning large distances without interrup-
tion: bridges, roof systems, stadiums, aircraft hangers, auditoriums for example.
They are also used for crane booms, radio towers and the like. Trusses are light-
weight and relatively strong. Over the years many unique truss designs have
been developed and are often named after the original designer.

    A frame is a multi-part, rigid, stationary structure primarily designed to
support some type of load. A frame contains at least one multi-force member,
which a truss never has. This means that, unlike trusses, frame members must
support bending moments as well as shear and normal forces. Many common
items can be considered frames. Some examples: building structures, bike frames,
ladders, scaffolding, and more.

    A machine is very similar to a frame, except that it includes some moving
parts. The purpose of a machine is usually to provide a mechanical advantage

and multiply forces. Pliers, scissors jacks, automobile suspensions, and construc-
tion equipment are all examples of machines.

Figure 6.1.1 Scissors and bridges are examples of engineering structures. Scis-
sors are machines with three interconnected parts. The bridge is a truss.

    Solving a structure means determining all forces acting on all of its parts.
The solution typically begins by determining the global equilibrium of the entire
structure, then breaking it into parts and analyzing each separate part. The
specific process will depend on the type of structure, but will always follow the
principles covered in the previous chapters.

Two-force Members. Many structures contain at least one two-force mem-
ber, and trusses consist of two-force members exclusively. Recall from Subsec-
tion 3.3.3 that a two-force body is an object subjected to exactly two forces.
Two-force members are not required to be slender or straight but can be recog-
nized because they connect to other bodies or supports at exactly two points,
and have no other loading unless it is also applied at those points.

    Identifying two-force members is helpful when solving structures because
they automatically establish the line of action of the two forces. For a two-force
body to be in equilibrium, the forces acting on it must be equal in magnitude,
opposite in direction, and act along a line passing through the points where the
two forces are applied. Since these points are known, the direction of the line of
action is readily found.

    The common way to express the force of a two-force member is with a mag-
nitude and a sense, where the sense is either tension or compression. If the two
forces tend to stretch the object we say it is in tension; if they act the other way
and squash the object, it is in compression. The usual approach is to assume that
a two-force member is in tension, then draw the free-body diagram and write
the equilibrium equations accordingly. If the analysis shows that the forces are
negative then they actually act with the opposite sense, i.e. compression.

Figure 6.1.2 Two-force members in tension and compression.

6.2 Interactions between members

When analyzing structures we are dealing with multi-body systems and need
to recall Newton's 3rd Law, "For every action, there is an equal and opposite
reaction."

    This law applies to multi-body systems wherever one body connects to an-
other. At any interaction point, forces are transferred from one body to the
interacting body as equal and opposite action-reaction pairs. These forces can-
cel out and are invisible when the structure is intact. Only when we cut through
a member or joint in the isolation step of creating a free-body diagram, do we
expose the interaction forces. When drawing free-body diagrams of the compo-
nents of structures, it is critically important to represent these action-reaction
pairs consistently. You may assume either direction for one, but the other must
be equal and opposite.

    For example, look at the members and joints in the truss below. Diagram
(a) shows the truss members held together by pins at A, B, and C. The forces
holding the parts together cancel and are not shown. In the `exploded' view (b),
the parts have been separated and the action-reaction pairs are exposed. Member
AB is in tension, and the forces acting on it, also called AB, oppose each other
and tend to stretch the member. These stretching forces are accompanied by
equal and opposite forces, also called AB acting on pins A and B. Tensile forces
BC and compressive forces CA behave similarly.

Thinking Deeper 6.2.2 Multi-body systems.

When a multipart structure is in equilibrium, each part of the structure is
also in equilibrium. For example in the truss below, each member of the
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES                                               204

truss, each joint, and each portion of the truss is also in equilibrium. This
continues all the way down to the atoms of the structure. This universal
equilibrium across spatial scales allows us to break multi-body systems
into smaller solvable parts.

diagrams at any scale to expose our target unknowns.

6.2.1 Load Paths

Load paths can help you think about structural systems. Load paths show how
applied forces like the floor load in the image below pass through the intercon-
nected members of the structure until they end up at the fixed support reac-
tions. All structural systems, whether non-moving frames or moving machines
have some sort of load path. When analyzing all structures, you computation-
ally move from known values through the interconnected bodies of the system,
following the load path, solving for unknowns as you go.

    Key Questions
       · What are simple trusses and how do they differ from other structural
           systems?

       · What are the benefits and dangers of simple trusses?

       · How can we determine the forces acting within simple truss systems?

       · For a truss in equilibrium, why is every individual member, joint,
           and section cut from the truss also in equilibrium?

       · How do we identify zero-force members in a truss and use their
           presence to simplify the analysis?

6.3.1 Introduction

A truss is a rigid engineering structure made up of long, slender members con-
nected at their ends. Trusses are commonly used to span large distances with a
strong, lightweight structure. Some familiar applications of trusses are bridges,
roof structures, and pylons. Planar trusses are two-dimensional trusses built
out of triangular subunits, while space trusses are three-dimensional, and the
basic unit is a tetrahedron.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  206

    In this section, we will analyze a simplified approximation of a planar truss,
called a simple truss and determine the forces the members individually sup-
port when the truss supports a load. Two different approaches will be presented:
the method of sections, and the method of joints.

6.3.2 Simple Trusses

Truss members are connected to each other rigidly, by welding or joining the
ends with a gusset plate. This makes the connecting joints rigid but also makes
the truss difficult to analyze. To reduce the mathematical complexity in this text
we will only consider simple trusses, which are a simplification appropriate for
preliminary analysis.

Figure 6.3.1 Truss with riveted gusset plates.

    Simple trusses are made of all two-force members and all joints are modeled as
frictionless pins. All applied and reaction forces are applied only to these joints.
Simple trusses, by their nature, are statically determinate, having a sufficient
number of equations to solve for all unknown values. While the members of real-
life trusses stretch and compress under load, we will continue to assume that all
bodies we encounter are rigid.

    Simple trusses are made of triangles, which makes them rigid when removed
from supports. Simple trusses are determinate, having a balance of equations
and unknowns, following the equation:

2 × (number of joints) = (number of reaction forces) + (number of members)

system equations  system unknowns

    Commonly, rigid trusses have only three reaction forces, resulting in the
equation:

                  2 × (number of joints) = 3 + (number of members)
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  207

    Unstable trusses lack the structural members to maintain their rigidity when
removed from their supports. They can also be recognized using the equation
above having more system equations on the left side of the equation above than
system unknowns on the right.

    Truss systems with redundant members have fewer system equations on the
left side of the equation above than the system unknowns on the right. While
they are indeterminate in statics, in later courses you will learn to solve these
trusses too, by taking into account the deformations of the truss members.

   Thinking Deeper 6.3.2 The Danger of Simple Trusses.

   Simple trusses have no structural redundancy, which makes them easy to
   solve using the techniques of this chapter, however, this simplicity also has
   a dark side.

These trusses are sometimes called fracture-critical trusses because the
failure of a single component can lead to catastrophic failure of the en-
tire structure. With no redundancy, there is no alternative load path for
the forces that normally would be supported by that member. You can
visualize the fracture-critical nature of simple trusses by thinking about
a triangle with pinned corners. If one side of a triangle fails, the other
two sides lose their support and will collapse. In a full truss made of only
triangles, the collapse of one triangle starts a chain reaction which causes
others to collapse as well.
While fracture-critical bridges are being replaced by more robust designs,
there are still thousands in service across the United States. To read more
about two specific fracture critical collapses search the internet for the
Silver Bridge collapse, or the I-5 Skagit River Bridge collapse.

6.3.3 Solving Trusses

"Solving" a truss means identifying and determining the unknown forces carried
by the members of the truss when supporting the assumed load. Because trusses
contain only two-force members, these internal forces are all purely axial. Inter-
nal forces in frames and machines will additionally include traverse forces and
bending moments, as you will see in Chapter 8.

    Determining the internal forces is only the first step of a thorough analysis of
a truss structure. Later steps would include refining the initial analysis by consid-
ering other load conditions, accounting for the weight of the members, relaxing
the requirement that the members be connected with frictionless pins, and ulti-
mately determining the stresses in the structural members and the dimensions
required to prevent failure.

    Two strategies to solve trusses will be covered in the following sections: the
Method of Joints and the Method of Sections. Either method may be used, but
the Method of Joints is usually easier when finding the forces in all the members,
while the Method of Sections is a more efficient way to solve for specific members
without solving the entire truss. It's also possible to mix and match methods.

    The initial steps to solve a truss are the same for both methods. First, ensure
that the structure can be modeled as a simple truss, then draw and label a sketch
of the entire truss. Each joint should be labeled with a letter, and the members
will be identified by their endpoints, so member AB is the member between
joints A and B. This will help you keep everything organized and consistent
in later analysis. Then, treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for the
external reactions using the methods of Chapter 5. If the truss is cantilevered
and unsupported at one end you may not actually need the reaction forces and
may skip this step. The reaction forces can be used later to check your work.

6.3.4 Zero-Force Members

Sometimes a truss will contain one or more zero-force members. As the name
implies, zero-force members carry no force and thus support no load. Zero-force
members will be found when you apply equilibrium equations to the joints, but
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES                                 209

you can save some work if you can spot and eliminate them before you begin.
Fortunately, zero-force members can easily be identified by inspection with two
rules.

· Rule 1: If two non-collinear members meet at an unloaded joint, then both
   are zero-force members.

· Rule 2: If three forces (interaction, reaction, or applied forces) meet at a
   joint and two are collinear, then the third is a zero-force member.

C            Consider the truss to the left. As-
         sume that the dimensions, angles and
B  D     the magnitude of force C are given. At
         joint B, there are two vertical collinear
         members as well as a third member
         which is horizontal, so Rule 2 should ap-
         ply.

             What does Rule 2 say about mem-
         ber BD? Can it tell us anything about
         member DA?

A     E

    Cutting the members at the dotted boundary line ex-          BC
poses internal forces BC, BD and BA. These forces act
along the axis of the corresponding members by the nature of     B
two-force members, and for convenience have been assumed
in tension although that may turn out to be incorrect.                          BD
                                                                         BA
    Rule 2 applies here since BA and BC are collinear and         BC
BD is not.
                                                              B      BD
    The free-body diagram of joint B may be drawn by elim-
inating the cut members and only showing the forces them-
selves.

    The situation is simple enough to apply the equilibrium
equations in your head.

                                                                                                     BA

    Vertically, forces BC and BA must be equal, and horizontally, force BD
must be zero to satisfy Fx = 0. We learn that member BD is a zero-force
member.

    While it is probably easiest to think about Rule 2 when the third member
is perpendicular to the collinear pair, it doesn't have to be. Any perpendicular
component must be zero which implies that the corresponding member is zero-
force.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES                                 210

Finding zero-force members is an iterative process. If                    y

you determine that a member is zero-force, eliminate it and   DC

you may find others. Continuing the analysis at joint D              x

draw its free-body diagram. Keep in mind that if one end BD       D
of a member is zero-force the whole member is zero-force.

Since member BD is zero-force, horizontal force BD acting

on joint D is zero and need not be included on the free-      DA DE

body diagram, and the remaining three forces match the

conditions to apply Rule 2.

    Analyzing the joint as before, but with a coordinate system aligned with the
collinear pair,

                                  Fy = 0
                             DA sin  = 0

    This equation will be satisfied if DA = 0 or if sin  = 0 but the second
condition is only true when  = 0 or  = 180, which is not the case here.
Therefore, force DA must be zero, and we can conclude that member DA is a
zero-force member as well.

    Finally consider joint C and draw its free-body diagram.  C
Does either Rule apply to this joint? No. You will need to
solve two equilibrium equations with this free-body diagram           DC
to find the magnitudes of forces CD and CB.                   BC

    On the other hand, if the horizontal load C was not
present or if either BC or DC was zero-force, then Rule
1 would apply and the remaining members would also be
zero-force.

C The final truss after eliminating the
                                     zero-force members is shown to the left.

                             Forces BC = BA and DC = DE

                             and the members may be replaced with

                             longer members AC and CE.

                             The original truss has been reduced

B  D                         to a simpler triangular structure with
                             only three internal forces to be found.

                             Once you learn to spot zero force mem-

                             bers, this simplification can be made

                             without drawing any diagrams or per-

A E forming any calculations.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  211

Thinking Deeper 6.3.5 Why include Zero-Force Members?

You may be wondering what is the point of including a member in a
truss if it supports no load. In our simplified example problems, they are
unnecessary, but in the real world, zero-force members are important for
several reasons:

   · We have assumed that all members have negligible weight or if not,
       applied half the weight to each pin. The actual weight of real mem-
       bers invalidates the two-force body assumption and leads to errors.
       Consider a vertical member -- the internal forces must at least sup-
       port the member's weight.

   · Truss members are not actually rigid, and long slender members
       under compression will buckle and collapse. The so-called zero-force
       member will be engaged to prevent this buckling. In the previous
       example, members CD and DE are under compression and form an
       unstable equilibrium and would definitely buckle at pin D if they
       were not replaced with a single member CE with sufficient rigidity.

   · Trusses are often used over a wide array of loading conditions. While
       a member may be zero-force for one loading condition, it will likely
       be engaged under a different condition -- think about how the load
       on a bridge shifts as a heavy truck drives across.

So finding a zero-force member in a determinate truss does not mean
you can discard the member. Zero-force members can be thought of as
removed from the analysis, but only for the loading you are currently ana-
lyzing. After removing zero-force members, you are left with the simplest
truss which connects the reaction and applied forces with triangles. If you
misinterpret the rules you may over-eliminate members and be left with
missing legs of triangles or `floating' forces that have no load path to the
foundation.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES      212

Example 6.3.6 Zero-Force Member Example.

    Given the truss shown,
eliminate all the zero-force
members, and draw the re-
maining truss.

Solution. Rule 1:

   · Due to two members meeting at unloaded joint G, both members
       GH and F G are zero-force members

   · Due to two members meeting at unloaded joint D, both members
       DE and CD are zero-force members

Rule 2:

   · Due to three forces meeting at joining B, with two being collinear
       (internal forces in AB and BC) then BF is a zero-force member.

   · Due to three forces meeting at joint I, with two being collinear
       (internal forces in IF and CI), then EI is a zero-force member. Note
       that member EI does not need to be perpendicular to the collinear
       members to be a zero force.

   · After removing zero-force members EI and DE, three forces remain
       at E, with two being collinear (internal force in EF and external
       load FE), making EC a zero-force member.

    The remaining truss is
shown. Note that once EI
and BF are eliminated, you
can effectively eliminate the
joints B and I as the member
forces in the collinear mem-
bers will be equal. Also notice
that the truss is still formed of
triangles which fully support
all of the applied forces.

6.4 Method of Joints

    Key Questions
       · What are the important components to include on a free-body dia-
           gram of a joint in a truss?
       · How are the solutions found at one joint used to create an accurate
           free-body diagram of another joint?
       · How do we ensure that tension or compression in a member is prop-
           erly represented?

    The method of joints is a process used to solve for the unknown forces
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  214

acting on members of a truss. The method centers on the joints or connection
points between the members, and it is most useful when you need to solve for
all the unknown forces in a truss structure.

    The joints are treated as particles subjected to force by the connected mem-
bers and any applied loads. As the joints are in equilibrium and the forces are
concurrent, F = 0 can be applied, but the M = 0 equation provides no
information.

    For planar trusses, each joint yields two scalar equations, Fx = 0 and
Fy = 0, and so two unknowns can be found. Therefore, a joint can be solved
when there are one or two unknown forces and at least one known force acting
on it.

    Forces are transferred from joint to joint by the connecting members, so when
unknown forces on a joint are found, the corresponding forces on adjacent joints
are also found.

6.4.1 Procedure

The procedure is a straightforward application of rigid body and particle equi-
librium

   1. Determine if the structure is a truss and if it is determinate. See Subsec-
       tion 6.3.2

   2. Identify and remove all zero-force members. This is not required but will
       eliminate unnecessary computations. See Subsection 6.3.4.

   3. Determine if you need to find the external reactions. If you can identify
       a solvable joint immediately, then you do not need to find the external
       reactions.

       A solvable joint includes one or more known forces and no more than two
       unknown forces. If there are no joints that satisfy this condition then you
       will need to find the external reactions before proceeding, using a free-body
       diagram of the entire truss.

   4. Identify a solvable joint and solve it using the methods of Chapter 3. When
       drawing free-body diagrams of joints you should

          · Represent the joint as a dot.

          · Draw all known forces in their known directions with arrowheads
              indicating their sense. Known forces are the given loads and forces
              determined from previously solved joints.

          · Assume the sense of unknown forces. A common practice is to assume
              that all unknown forces are in tension, i.e. pulling away from the free-
              body diagram of the pin, and label them based on the member they
              represent.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES                          215

       Finally, write out and solve the force equilibrium equations for the joint. If
       you assumed that all forces were tensile earlier, negative answers indicate
       compression.

   5. Once the unknown forces acting on a joint are determined, carry these
       values to the adjacent joints and repeat step four until all the joints have
       been solved. Take care when transferring forces to adjoining joints to
       maintain their sense -- either tension or compression.

   6. If you solved for the reactions in step two, you will have more equations
       available than unknown forces when you reach the last joint. The extra
       equations can be used to check your work.

    Rather than solving the joints sequentially, you could write out the equations
for all the joints first and solve them simultaneously using a matrix solution, but
only if you have a computer available as large matrices are not typically solvable
with a calculator.

    The interactive below shows a triangular truss supported by a pin at A and
a roller at B, and loaded at joint C. You can see how the reactions and internal
forces adjust as you vary the load at C. You can solve it by starting at joint C
and solving for BC and CD, then moving to joint B and solving for AB Joint
A can be used to check your work.

6.5 Method of Sections

   Key Questions

       · How do we determine an appropriate section to cut through a truss?

       · How are equilibrium equations applied to a section?

    The method of sections is used to solve for the unknown forces within
specific members of a truss without solving for them all. The method involves
dividing the truss into sections by cutting through the selected members and
analyzing the section as a rigid body. The advantage of the Method of Sections
is that the only internal member forces exposed are those which you have cut
through, the remaining internal forces are not exposed and thus ignored.

6.5.1 Procedure

The procedure to solve for unknown forces using the method of sections is

   1. Determine if a truss can be modeled as a simple truss.

   2. Identify and eliminate all zero-force members. Removing zero-force mem-
       bers is not required but may eliminate unnecessary computations.

   3. Solve for the external reactions, if necessary. Reactions will be necessary
       if the reaction forces act on the section of the truss you choose to solve
       below.

   4. Use your imaginary chain saw to cut the truss into two pieces by cutting
       through some or all of the members you are interested in. The cut does
       not need to be a straight line.
       Every cut member exposes an unknown internal force, so if you cut three
       members you'll expose three unknowns. Exposing more than three mem-
       bers is not advised because you create more unknowns than available equi-
       librium equations.

   5. Select the easier of the two halves of the truss and draw its free-body
       diagram.

          · Include all applied and reaction forces acting on the section, and show
              known forces acting in their known directions.

          · Draw unknown forces in assumed directions and label them. A com-
              mon practice is to assume that all unknown forces are in tension and
              label them based on the endpoints of the member they represent.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  217

   6. Write out and solve the equilibrium equations for your chosen section. If
       you assumed that unknown forces were tensile, negative answers indicate
       compression.

   7. If you have not found all the required forces with one section cut, repeat
       the process using another imaginary cut or proceed with the method of
       joints if it is more convenient.

    The interactive below demonstrates the method of sections. The internal
forces in the truss members are exposed by cutting through the truss at three
locations. The known loads are shown in red, and the unknown reactions Fx,
Ax and Ay, and unknown member forces are shown in blue. All members are
assumed to be in tension. In this situation, it is not necessary to find the
reactions if the section to the right of the cut is selected.

6.6 Frames and Machines

    Key Questions
       · How are frames and machines different from trusses?
       · Why are the methods of joints and sections not appropriate for
           frames and machines?
       · How do we identify if a structure is independently rigid?
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  218

       · How do we apply equilibrium equations to each member of the struc-
           ture, and ensure that the sense of a force appearing on multiple
           free-body diagrams is consistent?

    Frame and machines are engineering structures that contain at least one
multi-force member. As their name implies, multi-force members have more
than two concentrated loads, distributed loads, and/or couples applied to them
and therefore are not two-force members. Note that all bodies we investigated
in Chapter 5 were all multi-force bodies.

    Frames are rigid, stationary structures designed to support loads and must
include at least one multi-force member.

    Machines are non-rigid structures where the parts can move relative to one
another. Generally, they have an input and an output force and are designed
to produce a mechanical advantage. Note that all machines in this text are in
static equilibrium by their interacting and applied forces.

    Though there is a design difference between frames and machines they are
grouped together because they can both be analyzed using the same process,
which is the subject of this section.

Figure 6.6.1 Frames are rigid ob-  Figure 6.6.2 Machines contain
jects containing multi-force mem-  multi-force members that can move
bers.                              relative to one another.

6.6.1 Analyzing Frames and Machines

Analyzing a frame or machine means determining all applied, reaction, and in-
ternal forces and couples acting on the structure and all of its parts.

    Multi-part structures are analyzed by mentally taking them apart and ana-
lyzing the entire structure and each part separately. Each component is analyzed
as a separate rigid body using the techniques we have already seen.

    Although we can separate the structure into parts, the parts are not indepen-
dent since, by Newton's Third Law, every interaction is half of a complementary
pair. For every force or moment of body A on B there is an equal-and-opposite
force or moment of body B on body A and the free-body diagrams must reflect
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  219

this. Incorrect representation of these interacting pairs on free-body diagrams
is a common source of student errors.

    Once the frame or machine is disassembled and free-body diagrams have
been drawn, the structure is analyzed by applying equations of equilibrium to
free-body diagrams, exactly as you have done before --there's nothing new here.

    The difficulty arises first in selecting objects and drawing correct free-body
diagrams and second, in identifying an efficient solution strategy since you usu-
ally won't be able to completely solve a diagram without first finding the value
of an unknown force from another diagram.

    In Chapter 5 we saw that each two-dimensional free-body diagram results
in up to three linearly independent equations. By disassembling the structure
we create new free-body diagrams that can be used to determine more unknown
values. Here are a few more details on the number of equations that come from
each type of two-dimensional free-body diagram:

   · Two-force members.

       One equation. Two-force members can be recognized as either a cable or a
       weightless link with all forces coming from two frictionless pins. The force
       at one pin is equal and opposite to the force on the other placing the body
       in tension or compression.

   · Objects with concurrent forces and no couple-moments.

       Two equations. These are the problems you solved in Chapter 3. There
       are two equations available Fx = 0 and Fy = 0.

   · Multi-force rigid body with non-concurrent forces and/or couples.

       Three equations. These are the most general body types. Use Fx = 0,
       Fy = 0, andM = 0 to solve for three unknowns.

Procedure

The process used to analyze frames and machines is outlined below

   1. Determine if the entire structure is independently rigid. An independently
       rigid structure will hold it shape even when separated from its supports.
       Look for triangles formed among the members, as triangles are inherently
       rigid. If it is not independently rigid, the structure will collapse when the
       supports are removed.

       If the structure is not independently rigid, skip to the next step. Otherwise,
       model it as a single rigid body and determine the external reaction forces.

   2. Draw a free-body diagram for each of the members in the structure. You
       must represent all forces acting on each member, including:
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES                                   220

  · Applied forces and couples and the weights of the components if non-
      negligible.

  · Interaction forces due to two-force members. There will be a force
      of unknown magnitude but the known direction at points connected
      to two-force members. The forces will act along the line between the
      two connection points.

  · All reaction forces and moments at the connection points between
      members. Forces with an unknown magnitude and direction are usu-
      ally represented by unknown x and y components, but can also be
      represented as a force of unknown magnitude acting in an unknown
      direction.

All interaction forces and moments between connected bodies must be
shown as equal-and-opposite action-reaction pairs.

F.                              reaction pairs are in blue.

3. Write out the equilibrium equations for each free-body diagram.

4. Solve the equilibrium equations for the unknowns. You can do this alge-
   braically, solving for one variable at a time, or you can use matrix equations
   to solve for everything at once. Negative magnitudes indicate that the as-
   sumed direction of that term was incorrect, and the actual force/moment
   is opposite the assumed direction.

    In the following example, we'll discuss how to select objects, distinguish
external and internal loads, draw consistent and correct free-body diagrams,
and identify a good solution strategy.

Free-body diagram of structures

Drawing free-body diagrams of complex frames and machines can be tricky. In
this section, we will walk through the process of selecting appropriate objects
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES               221

and drawing consistent and correct free-body diagrams to solve a typical machine
problem.

    The toggle clamp shown in Figure 6.6.5 is used to quickly secure wooden
furniture parts to the bedplate of a CNC router in order to cut mortise and
tenon joints. The component parts are shown and named in Figure 6.6.6.

diagram                       parts.

    This original diagram is not a free-body diagram because all the forces neces-
sary to hold the objects in equilibrium are not indicated. The only force shown is
F, which is supplied by some external agent, presumably the machine operator.
We must assume that the wall and floor are still attached to the world and held
fixed.

    To perform an equilibrium analysis, we need to develop one or more free-body
diagrams and apply the equations of equilibrium to them. Free-body diagrams
can be drawn for the entire structure, each individual part, and any combination
of connected parts. Not all these diagrams will be needed, and part of the
challenge of solving these problems is selecting and drawing only the diagrams
you need. In any event, a clear decision must always be made about what is
part of the free body and what is not.

    When we separate one body from another loads will appear on both bod-
ies which act to constrain them as they were constrained before the separation.
These forces and moments must be represented on the free-body diagrams con-
sistently as halves of equal-and-opposite action-reaction pairs.

    For this discussion, we will progressively exclude parts from the original
structure and draw the free-body diagram of what remains. In so doing we
will clarify the difference between internal and external forces, recognize and
take advantage of two-force bodies, and provide some tips for drawing correct
free-body diagrams. In an actual situation, you will not need to draw all these
diagrams, instead, you should think through the situation and draw only the
diagrams you will need for a solution.

    It is helpful to consider which loads are known and which are unknown as you
prepare free-body diagrams. In planar problems, a free-body diagram with three
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES                      222

or fewer unknowns may be solved immediately. When there are more than three
unknowns, you must incorporate information from other diagrams to complete
the solution.

Exclude the floor. To begin, we can remove the floor from the system. Every-
thing except the floor is now included as our body; only the floor is excluded.
The floor was in contact with the wooden block and connected to the wall.

    Since we don't know how the wall and the floor are connected we will assume
a rigid, fixed connection. We also have to model how the wall is attached to the
rest of the world. The fixed support from wall-to-world and wall-to-floor can be
combined to be a single set of three loads which we represent as horizontal and
vertical forces Vx and Vy, and a concentrated moment Mv.

Figure 6.6.7 Free-body Diagram 1
    The effect of the floor on the block is represented by a single vertical force G

which holds the block the same way the floor was previously supporting it; the
loads you add must constrain your object the same way they were constrained
in the real world. This representation is a simplification of the actual situation
since the force of the floor is distributed over the bottom surface of the block;
however, this simplification is justified in much the same way as we represent
the weight of an object as a single force acting at its center of gravity.

                                                Tips.

       · Include friction if it's given or obvious.

       · Internal forces in rigid bodies should be modeled as a fixed support.

       · If you need info that you don't have, select a variable to act as its
           name.

Exclude the wall. If you next remove the wall, forces G and F remain from
before, but we now expose four loads from where the wall was connected to what
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES               223

is now our body; a normal force N at the roller and three loads from the fixed
support between the bearing block and the wall Wx, Wy, and M .

    Note that the reactions between the wall and the floor are no longer included

in the free-body diagram because they are both on the same side of the included-
excluded table. Only loads that cross from included to excluded produce a load
on the free-body diagram.

                                                Tips.

       · Every force needs a point of application and a clear arrowhead.

       · Indicate any distances and angles needed and not available on the
           original diagram.

       · Define the direction of forces that are not vertical or horizontal with
           an angle from a reference direction.

       · Define a coordinate system unless you are using the standard x-y
           axes.

       · Do not add forces that don't act on your body.

Exclude the bearing at A. We are not interested in the loads between the
bearing block and the wall Wx, Wy, and M and further, the free-body diagram
still includes too many unknowns to solve.

    After removing the bearing we reduce the unknowns at A to two because the
bearing block and the lever are connected with a pin while the bearing block
and wall were connected with a fixed support. The loads Wx, Wy, and M and
Vx, Vy, and Mv are not included on this free-body diagram because they don't
act on this object.

                                                Tips.

       · Look for free-body diagrams that include only three unknowns in
           two dimensions or six unknowns in three.

       · Don't include internal loads on your free-body diagrams.

· If the two forces are not the same don't identify them by the same

· Make as few assumptions as you possibly can. Make a note of any
   assumptions you make.

· In textbook problems, if the weight of an object is not mentioned it

Exclude the wooden block. We can further simplify the diagram by remov-
ing the wooden block, leaving only the roller, short link and lever.

Examine the short link BD. The short link BD is a two-force body and as
discussed in Subsection 3.3.3 can only be in equilibrium if the forces at B and
D are equal-and-opposite and act along a line passing through these two points.
This means that the 24:7 slope of the link determines the direction of force BD.

                     When drawing free-body diagrams, forces with known direc-
                 tions should be drawn pointing in that direction rather than
             24  breaking them into components, otherwise, you may lose track
         7       of the fact that the x and y components are not independent but
                 are actually related by the direction of the force.

Figure 6.6.12 Free-body diagram 6 (short link)
    Here we have assumed that the forces acting on the link are compressive. If

the equilibrium equations produce a positive value for BD our assumption is
proved correct, while a negative result indicates that we were wrong and the link
is actually in tension.

                                                Tips.

       · A short-link is a two-force body.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  226

· Recognize two-force bodies because they give you information about
   direction.

· Represent the force of a two-force body as a force with unknown
   magnitude acting along a known line of action, not as x and y com-
   ponents.

· If you don't know the sense of a force along its line of action, assume
   one. If you guess wrong, the analysis will give you a negative value.

                                                             Note that the force BD acting on the roller is shown poin
                                                        down and to the left. This is equal and opposite to the f
                                                        acting on the link at D, which points up and to the right. T
                                                        two must act in opposite directions because they are an ac
                                                Q reaction pair.

Examine the roller at D. Figure 6.6.13 Free-body diagram 7 (roller)
         The roller is a three-force body, so the lines of action of N , Q, and BD are

    coincident and it may be treated as a particle. Equilibrium analysis shows that
    N and Q must oppose the horizontal and vertical components of force BD.

         The clamping force Q produced by the toggle clamp appears on this free-body
    diagram so it will be important later for the solution.

                                                    Tips.

            · Recognize three-force bodies and use their special properties to your
                advantage.

            · Use the same name for the exposed forces on interacting bodies since
                they are equal-and-opposite halves of an action-reaction pair.

Exclude the roller. We can further simplify the free-body diagram by re-
moving the roller. The roller and short link are connected with a pin but, for
equilibrium, the forces acting on a short link (or any two-force body) must share
the same line of action -- the line connecting its endpoints; otherwise, compo-
nents perpendicular to this line would produce an unbalanced moment about
the other endpoint.

    The load BD acting on the lever in this diagram has the same magnitude,

direction, and line of action as the load acting on the short link at D, so this
can be thought of as sliding a force along its line of action -- an equivalent
transformation.

    The following loads are not shown here because they act between two objects
that are not part of the body:

   · the loads between the bearing block and the wall Wx, Wy, and M ,

   · the loads between the floor and the wall Vx, Vy, and Mv,

   · the load between the block and the floor G, and

   · the load between the roller and the wall N .

    All of the free-body diagrams we have drawn are correct, though not all
are necessary. Generally, we only draw the free-body diagrams needed for the
solution. These diagrams form a chain that connects the known input forces to
the desired output forces. When solving frames and machines, think carefully
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  228

about what you know and what you need to solve for: that determines which free-
body diagrams you will need. Taking a few moments to consider what unknowns
you'd have at each step can help you optimize your problem-solving effort.

    You should recognize that it is possible to draw incorrect free-body diagrams
which produce correct results. Consider the diagram below.

            pening at pin D.

Figure 6.6.16 Free-body diagram 10 (Subtly incorrect)

    Forces N and Q do not actually act on the short link at D. Force N acts
between the roller and the wall and clearly this diagram doesn't include the roller.
Similarly Q acts between the block and the roller. These forces don't belong on
the free-body diagram even though they are equal to the x and y components
of force BD. Only forces that cross the imaginary boundary between the object
and the rest of the world belong on the free-body diagram.

    Students are inclined to argue that this free-body diagram is statically equiv-
alent to Figure 6.6.11 and it produces the correct answer so it must be OK. It
isn't correct because it reflects a misunderstanding about what you are modeling
and what you aren't. Other engineers using your FBDs need to know what you
are modeling. The FBD is the key to your analysis of the real world.

Knowing that angle  = 60°, find the vertical clamping force acting on the
piece at D and the magnitude of the force exerted on member ABC at
pin B in terms of force F applied to the clamp arm at C.

We will assume the two-force member BD is in compression based on
the physical situation. The forces acting on the link, lever and roller are

triangles give

While you could certainly find Ax, Ay and N using other equilibrium
equations they weren't asked for and we don't bother to find them.

Thinking Deeper 6.6.19 Why does the Method of Joints work on trusses
but not on Frames or Machines?

We can solve trusses using the methods of joints and method of sections
because all members of a simple truss are two-force bodies. Cutting a truss
member exposes an internal force that has an unknown scalar magnitude,
but a known line of action. The force acts along the axis of the member
and causes no bending if the member is straight. Cutting a truss member
exposes one unknown.
Frames and machines are made of multi-force members and cutting these,
in general, exposes:

   · A force with an unknown magnitude acting in an unknown direction,
       and

   · A bending moment at the plane of the cut.

Cutting a two-dimensional multi-force member exposes three unknowns,
and six are exposed for a three-dimensional body. The number of un-
knowns quickly exceeds the available equations rendering the problem im-
possible to solve.
Bottom line: use the method of sections and joints only for trusses made
of two-force straight members; for all other multi-force rigid body systems
draw and analyze free-body diagrams of the components.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  231

6.7 Summary

The various equilibrium topics we have covered and the associated problem-
solving techniques are summarized below.

    You should be able to recognize these situations, draw the associated free-
body diagrams and solve for the unknowns of each case.

Particle Equilibrium. An object may be treated as a particle when the forces
acting on it are coincident, that is, all of their lines of action intersect at a
common point. In this case, they produce no moment to rotate the object, and
M = 0 is not helpful. The applicable equation is

                                              F = 0,

which produces two scalar equations in two dimensions and three scalar equations
in three dimensions.

Rigid Body Equilibrium. A rigid body can rotate and translate so both
force and moment equilibrium must be considered.

                                               F = 0
                                              M = 0

    In two dimensions, these equations produce two scalar force equations and
one scalar moment equation. Up to three unknowns can be determined.

    In three dimension, they produce three scalar force equations and three scalar
moment equations. Up to six unknowns can be determined.

Trusses. A truss is a structure that consists entirely of two-force members and
only carries forces at the joints connecting members. Two-force members and
loading at joints allow free-body diagrams of the joints to expose the axial loads
in members.

    In addition to the equations provided by treating the entire truss as a rigid
body, each joint provides two additional equations for two-dimensional trusses,
and three for non-planar trusses.

Frames and Machines. Frames and machines are structures that contain
multiple rigid body systems. Frames don't move and are designed to support
loads. Machines are generally designed to multiply forces and usually have mov-
ing parts. Both frames and machines can be solved using the same methods.

    All interactions between bodies are equal and opposite action-reaction pairs.
    When solving frames and machines

   · Two-force members provide one useful equilibrium equation and can de-
       termine one unknown.
CHAPTER 6. EQUILIBRIUM OF STRUCTURES  232

· In two dimensions, rigid bodies result in two scalar force equations and
   one scalar moment equation. Up to three unknowns can be determined.

· In three dimensions, rigid bodies produce three scalar force equations and
   scalar three moment equations. Up to six unknowns can be determined.

Centroids and Centers of Gravity

A centroid is the geometric center of a geometric object: a one-dimensional
curve, a two-dimensional area or a three-dimensional volume. Centroids are use-
ful for many situations in Statics and subsequent courses, including the analysis
of distributed forces, beam bending, and shaft torsion.

    Two related concepts are the center of gravity, which is the average location
of an object's weight, and the center of mass which is the average location of
an object's mass. In many engineering situations, the centroid, center of mass,
and center of gravity are all coincident. Because of this, these three terms are
often used interchangeably without regard to their precise meanings.

    We consciously and subconsciously use centroids for many things in life and
engineering, including:

       Keeping your body's balance: Try standing up with your feet together and
       leaning your head and hips in front of your feet. You have just moved your
       body's center of gravity out of line with the support of your feet.

       Computing the stability of objects in motion like cars, airplanes, and boats:
       By understanding how the center of gravity interacts with the accelera-
       tions caused by motion, we can compute safe speeds for sharp curves on a
       highway.

       Designing the structural support to balance the structure's own weight and
       applied loadings on buildings, bridges, and dams: We design most large
       infrastructure not to move. To keep it from moving, we must understand
       how the structure's weight, people, vehicles, wind, earth pressure, and
       water pressure balance with the structural supports.

    You probably have already developed a good intuition about centroids and
centers of gravity based upon your life experience, and can roughly estimate their
location when you look at an object or diagram. In this chapter you will learn
to locate them precisely using two techniques: integration 7.7 and the method
of composite parts 7.5.

7.1 Weighted Averages

You certainly know how to find the average of several numbers by adding them

up and dividing by the number of values, so for example the average of the first

four positive integers is

                           1+2+3+4
                                             = 2.5

                                  4

More formally, if a is a set with n elements then the average, or mean, value

is n                       ai = a1 + a2 + · · · + an .
     1
a¯ =                                                                       (7.1.1)
                           n i=1 n

This average is also called the arithmetic mean. When calculating an arith-

metic mean, each number is equally important when evaluating the average. The

overbar symbol is often used to indicate that a quantity is a mean value.

In situations where some values are more important than others, we use a

weighted average. A familiar example is your grade point average. Your GPA

is calculated by weighting your grade for each class by the credits for that class,

then dividing by the total credits you have taken. The credit values are called

the weighting factors.

In general terms a weighted average is

                           a¯ = aiwi                                       (7.1.2)
                                     wi

Where ai are the values we are averaging and wi are the corresponding weighting
factors. The weighting factors may be different for each item being averaged, so
wi is the weighting factor for value ai. In this book we will not write the limits
on the sums, and understand that the intent is always to sum over all the values.
Notice that if the weighting factors are all identical, they can be factored out of
the sums so the weighted average and the arithmetic mean will be the same.

    Weighted averaging is used to find centroids, centers of gravity and centers
of mass, the subject of this chapter. All three are points located at the "center"
the object, but the meaning of "center" depends on the weighting factors. Area
or volume are the factors used for centroids, weight for center of gravity, and
mass for center of mass.

Example 7.1.1 Course Grades.

The mechanics syllabus says that there are two exams worth 25% each,
homework is 10%, and the final is worth 40%. You have a 40 on the first
exam, a 80 on the second exam, and your homework grade is 90.
What do you have to earn on the final exam to get a 70 in the class?

Solution. Your known grades and the weighting factors are

                           Gi = [40, 80, 90, F E]
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                      237

               wi = [25%, 25%, 10%, 40%]

Find final exam score F E so that your average grade G¯ is 70%.

   G¯ =  Giwi
          wi

   70 = (40 × 0.25) + (80 × 0.25) + (90 × 0.1) + (F E × 0.4)
                           (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.1 + 0.4)

   F E = 70(1) - (10 + 20 + 9) = 77.5
                       0.4

.

7.2 Center of Gravity

So far in this book we have always taken the weight of an object to act at a point
at its center. This is the center of gravity: the point where all of an object's
weight may be concentrated and still have the same external effect on the body.
In this chapter we will learn to actually locate this point.

       We will indicate the center of gravity with a circle with black and white
   quadrants, and call its coordinates (x¯, y¯) or (x¯, y¯, z¯). This point represents
   the average location of all the particles which make up the body.

    The center of gravity of a body is        y
fixed with respect to the body, but the
coordinates depend on the choice of co-                                                               x
ordinate system. For example, in Fig-
ure 7.2.1 the center of gravity of the       Figure 7.2.1 Location of the centroid,
block is at its geometric center mean-       measured from the origin.
ing that x¯ and y¯ are positive, but if the
block is moved to the left of the y axis,
or the coordinate system is translated
to the right of the block, x¯ would then
become negative.

    Lets explore the center of gravity of a familiar object. Take a pencil and try
to balance it on your finger. How do you decide where to place it? You likely
supported it roughly in the middle, then adjusted it until it balanced. You found
the point where the moments of the weights on either side of your finger were in
equilibrium.

    Let's develop this balanced moment idea mathematically.
    Assume that the two halves of the pencil have known weights acting at points
1 and 2. How could we replace the two weights with a single statically equivalent
force? Recall from Section 4.7 that statically equivalent systems produce the
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  238

same external effect on the object --the net force on the object, and the net
moment about any point don't change. An upward force at this point will
support the pencil without tipping.

    To be equivalent, the total weight must equal the total weight of the parts.
W = W1 + W2. Common sense also tells us that W will act somewhere between
W1 and W2.

Figure 7.2.2 (top) Side view of a pencil representing each half as a particle.
(middle) A force diagram showing the weights of the two particles. (bottom) An
equivalent system consisting of a single weight acting at the pencil's center of
gravity.

    Next, let's do the mathematical equivalent of sliding your finger back and
forth until a balance point is located. Pick any point O to be the origin, then
calculate the total moment about O due to the two weights.

    The sum of moments around point O can be written as:

                                        MO = -x1W1 - x2W2

    Notice that the moment of both forces are clockwise around point O, so the
signs are negative according to the right-hand rule. We want a single equivalent
force acting at the (unknown) center of gravity. Call the distance from the origin
to the center of gravity x¯.

    x¯ represents the mean distance of the weight, mass, or area depending on
the context of the problem. We are evaluating weights in this problem, so x¯
represents the distance from O to the center of gravity.

    The sum of moments around point O for the equivalent system can be written
as:

                                              MO = -x¯W

    The moment of total weight W is also clockwise around point O, so the sign
of moment will also be negative according to the right-hand rule. Since the two
representation are equivalent we can equate them and solve for x¯.

                                    -x¯W = -x1W1 - x2W2
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                      239

                             x¯ = x1W1 + x2W2
                                     W1 + W2

This result is exactly in the form of (7.1.2) where the value being averaged

is distance x and the weighting factor is the weight of part Wi and the result is

the mean distance x¯.

The pencil was made up of two halves, but this equation can easily be ex-

tended n discrete parts. The resulting general definition of the centroidal coor-

dinate x¯ is:                  x¯ = x¯iWi
                                         Wi
                                                                 (7.2.1)

where:

Wi is the weight of part i,

       x¯i is the x coordinate of the center of gravity of element i, and

                                                                                                                                                      n

           is understood to mean "sum all parts" so there is no need to write .

                                                                                                                                                    i=1

    The numerator is the first moment of force which is literally a moment of
force as we defined it in Chapter 3. The denominator is the sum of the weights
of the pieces, which is the weight of the whole object. We will soon also see first
moments of mass and first moments of area and in Chapter 10, we will introduce
second moments, which are the integral of some quantity like area, multiplied
by a distance squared.

    We treated the pencil as a one-dimensional object, so this discussion focused
on x¯. There are similar formula for the other dimensions as well

                x¯ = x¯iWi y¯ = y¯iWi z¯ = z¯iWi .               (7.2.2)
                       Wi      Wi              Wi

In words, these equations say

               distance to CG = sum of first moments of weight
                                                   total weight

    They apply to any object which can be divided into discrete parts, and they
produce the coordinates of the object's center of gravity.

Question 7.2.3

Can you explain why the center of gravity of a symmetrical object will
always fall on the axis of symmetry?

Answer. If the object is symmetrical, every subpart on the positive side
of the axis of symmetry will be balanced by an identical part on the neg-
ative side. The first moment for the entire shape about the axis will sum
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  240

to zero, meaning that

                                x¯ = x¯iWi = 0 = 0.
                                           Wi W

In other words, the distance from the axis of symmetry of the shape to
the centroid is zero.

Example 7.2.4 Simple Center of Gravity.

Three boxes are distributed along the x axis as shown.

   a. Find the distance from the
       origin to the center of grav-
       ity of the system.

   b. How would the center of
       gravity change if the ori-
       gin was moved to the right-
       hand box?

Solution. The center of gravity of the system is the point where the
total weight can be considered to act.
The total weight is W = Wi = 90 N, and it acts at the point where it
produces the same total moment as the individual weights. In other words,
it is an equivalent system. The moment comparison may be taken about
any point, so for convenience we choose the origin.
Let xi represent the x-coordinates of the individual weights, and x¯ rep-
resent the x-coordinate of the center of gravity. For both systems to be
equivalent:

                 W x¯ = (Wi xi)
            (90 N) x¯ = (50 N)(0) + (10 N)(1.2 m) + (30 N)(2.0 m)

                     x¯ = 72 N·m
                             90 N

                        = 0.8 m

If the origin was moved to the right-hand box, the center of gravity would
not change; however, the coordinate of the center of gravity would be
different. The distance to the center of gravity from the new origin would
be:

               x¯ = (10 N)(-0.8 m) + (50 N)(-2.0 m) = -1.2 m
                                        90 N
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY     241

7.3 Center of Mass

The center of mass is the mean location of the mass of an object, and is related
to the center of gravity by Newton's Second Law because

                    W = mg,

where g is the local strength of the gravitational field. In this course you may
take g = 9.81 m/s2 in the SI system, or g = 32.2 ft/s2 in the US customary
system as reasonable approximations for objects on the surface of the earth.

    Substituting mi gi = Wi in (7.2.2) gives the equations for the center of mass.

x¯ = x¯i mi gi y¯ = y¯i mi gi z¯ = z¯i mi gi .  (7.3.1)
mi gi               mi gi    mi gi

    By our assumption that g is constant on the surface of the earth, gi can be
factored out of the sums and drops out of the equation completely.

x¯ = x¯imi y¯ = y¯imi z¯ = z¯imi .              (7.3.2)
mi                  mi       mi

    These equations give the coordinates of the center of mass. The numerator
contains the first moment of mass, and the denominator contains the total
mass of the object. As long as the assumption that g is constant is valid, the
center of mass and the center of gravity are identical points and the two terms
may be used interchangeably.

7.4 Centroids

   Key Questions

       · What is the difference between a centroid, center of gravity and a
           center of mass?

       · When will the centroid, center of gravity and center of mass refer to
           the same point?

       · Why do the equations for the center of gravity, mass, volume, and
           area all have the same structure?

    A centroid is a weighted average like the center of gravity, but weighted with
a geometric property like area or volume, and not a physical property like weight
or mass. This means that centroids are properties of pure shapes, not physical
objects. They represent the coordinates of the "middle" of the shape.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                         242

    The defining equations for centroids are similar to the equations for Cen-
ters of Gravity (7.2.2) but with volume used as the weighting factor for three-
dimensional shapes

x¯ = x¯iVi y¯ = y¯iVi z¯ = z¯iVi ,                           (7.4.1)
Vi                                     Vi      Vi

and area for two-dimensional shapes

x¯ = x¯iAi y¯ = y¯iAi .                                      (7.4.2)
    Ai                                     Ai

    We will see how to use these equations on complex shapes later in this chapter,
but centroids of some simple shapes can be easily found using symmetry.

    If the shape has an axis of symmetry, every point on one side of the axis
is mirrored by another point equidistant on the other side. One has a positive
distance from the axis, and the other is the same distance away in the negative
direction. These two points will add to zero the numerator, as will every other
point making up the shape, and the first moment will be zero. This means that
the centroid must lie along the line of symmetry if there is one. If a shape has
multiple symmetry lines, then the centroid must exist at their intersection.

Figure 7.4.1 Centroids lie upon axes of symmetry.
    Since rectangles, circles, cubes, spheres, etc. have multiple lines of symmetry,

their centroids must be exactly in the center as we would expect.

    Question 7.4.2

    What are the coordinates of the                          5 cm
centroid of the I beam section shown?

                                                             1 cmx
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  243

Answer.

         x¯ = y¯ = 3.5 cm

Solution. The cross section is symmetrical about both a vertical and
horizontal centerline. The centroid is at the intersection, in the middle.
The coordinates are measured from the origin, in the bottom left of the
diagram.

                                     x¯ = y¯ = 3.5 cm

gration, but in the mean time several common shapes are recorded in the table

Note 7.4.4

In this table, all centroids are measured from the indicated origin. You
must make the appropriate adjustments when the origin of your coordinate
system is located elsewhere.

7.4.2 Relations between Centroids and Center of Gravity

The equations we have been discussing (7.2.2), (7.3.1), (7.4.1) and (7.4.2) are all
variations on the general weighted average formula (7.1.2).

                           a¯ = aiwi
                                     wi

    Here ai represents the distance in one of the coordinate directions such as
x, a¯ is the mean distance in the a direction to the `middle' of the whole object,
and w is the weighting factor. The only difference between them is the choice
of weighting factor. For center of gravity, the weighting factor is the weight, for
center of mass, it is the mass, for three dimensional centroids it is the volume,
and for two dimensional centroids it is area.

    To understand how these equations re-       Figure 7.4.5 Plate with vari-
late to one another consider a plate with a     able thickness t, divided into
cross-sectional area A, divided into n pieces   many volume elements Vi.
with volume Vi.

    The weight of part i is the product of its
specific weight and volume.

               Wi = Vi = igiAiti

    In the most general case, all of these terms might depend on the position
of the part, but if any are constant they can be factored out and simplify the
formulas.

    For a homogeneous flat plate with uniform thickness, like a piece of plywood,
the density, thickness and g are all constant so

                           Wi = gtAi

          x¯ = x¯iWi       y¯ = y¯iWi           z¯ = z¯iWi
                     Wi              Wi                   Wi

          x¯ = ¨g¨t x¯iAi  y¯ = ¨g¨t y¯iAi      z¯ = ¨g¨t z¯iAi

    The two dimensional centroid equations are sufficient to find the center of
gravity of a three dimensional object.

7.5 Centroids using Composite Parts

    Key Questions

       · How do you calculate the center of gravity of a system of separate
           objects?

       · Where do the equations for the shapes in areas and centroids table
           come from?

       · When finding the centroid, what do you do with a cut-out area of a
           composite part?

       · Does it matter whether a distance to the centroid of a part is positive
           or negative from the axis system?

    In this section we will discuss how to find centroids of two-dimensional shapes
by first dividing them into pieces with known properties, and then combining
the pieces to find the centroid of the original shape. This method will work
when the geometric properties of all the sub-shapes are known or can be easily
determined. If the shape can't be decomposed this way, perhaps because it
has a curved boundary, you will need to use integration to find the centroid.
Integration will be covered in Section 7.7.

    For convenience, the properties of several common shapes can be found here.

7.5.1 Composite Parts Method

The equations we will use for this approach are

        x¯ = x¯i Ai                  y¯ = y¯i Ai                       (7.5.1)
                   Ai                           Ai

where,

x¯, and y¯ are the coordinates of the centroid of the entire shape.

Ai is the area of composite part i.

x¯i, and y¯i are the coordinates of the centroid of composite part i.

The steps to finding a centroid using the composite parts method are:

1. Break the overall shape into simpler parts.

2. Collect the areas and centroid coordinates, and
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                                                         247

3. Apply (7.5.1) to combine to find the coordinates of the centroid of the
   original shape.

As a simple example, consider the L-shaped

area shown, which has been divided into two rec- 3 in  4 in

tangles. The areas of the rectangles are 1

               A1 = 18 in2, A2 = 14 in2

                                                                                              6 in
The origin is located at the lower left, so the
coordinates of the centroids of the two rectangles
are 2

                                                                                              2 in
x¯1 = 1.5 in, y¯1 = 5 in, x¯2 = 3.5 in, y¯2 = 1 in

The centroid of the whole shape is found by applying (7.5.1)

x¯ = x¯i Ai                         y¯ = y¯i Ai
           Ai                                  Ai

     (1.5)(18) + (3.5)(14)                   (5)(18) + (1)(14)
x¯ =                                y¯ =

              18 + 14                            18 + 14
x¯ = 2.375 in                       y¯ = 3.25 in

    For more complex shapes, the usual practice is to set up a table to organize
the information needed to calculate the centroid, as we will now show. The
process can be broken into three steps.

1. Break the overall shape into simpler parts.

   We begin with a sketch of the shape and establish a coordinate system. It
   is critical that all measurements are made from a common origin, and the
   results will be measured from this origin as well. A careful choice of origin
   can simplify the problem, so give it some thought.

   Then divide the shape into several simpler shapes. The sub-shapes may
   include holes, which are treated as negative areas. You must know how to
   calculate the area and locate the centroid of any sub-shape you use.

   Consider the complex shape below.

2 cm 2 cm                   1.5 cm

           3 cm             2 cm    6 cm

There are often several ways to divide a shape, but it's best to use as
few parts as possible to minimize your computations and opportunities for
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY             248

error. For example, you could choose to break this shape into either a
5 cm × 4 cm rectangle, a 6 cm × 4 cm right triangle, and an r = 1.5 cm
circular hole,

                                                1.5 cm

2 cm 2 cm

              5 cm          6 cm

or a large 11 cm × 4 cm rectangle, an r = 1.5 cm circular hole, and a
6 cm × 4 cm right triangle subtracted from the large rectangle.

2 cm 2 cm                                       1.5 cm

                 11 cm             6 cm

Both options will give the same results, and in this case there is no par-
ticular advantage to one choice over the other. However, it would be silly
and unnecessary to break this into more than three parts, and it would
not be a good idea to divide this into a trapezoid minus a hole, unless you
know geometric properties of a trapezoid, which are not available in Sub-
section 7.4.1. Be sure your sub-shapes don't overlap and don't get counted
more than once.

2. Collect the areas and centroid coordinates.

   Once the complex shape has been divided into parts, the next step is to
   determine the area and centroidal coordinates for each part. You can use
   the properties in Subsection 7.4.1 for rectangles, triangles, circles, semi-
   circles and quarter circles but you will need to use integration if other
   shapes are involved. Any holes or removed shapes should be treated as
   negative areas.

   Record the information you gather in a table like the one below. The table
   should include a row containing column headings and units, one row for
   each part, and a summary row. The first column identifies the part -- by
   number or sketch, the second contains the areas, and the third and fourth
   contains the centroidal coordinates of the parts.

           Part      Ai      x¯i y¯i     Aix¯i  Aiy¯i
                    [cm2]   [cm] [cm]    [cm3]  [cm3]

           1            20  2.5 2        50     40

           2            12  7 4/3 84            16

           3 -2.25  3 2 -6.75  -4.5

            24.93 -- -- 112.8 41.86
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  249

The last two columns of the table contain the first moments of area Qx =
Aiy¯i and Qy = Aix¯i, and are easily filled in by multiplying the values in
columns two to four. Be sure to attend to positive and negative signs when
multiplying. Note that the moment of area with respect to the x axis uses
the distance from the x axis, which is y¯i, and vice-versa.

The final row of the table are total values, calculated by summing the
entries for Ai, Qx and Qy, so for example the total area of the shape is

A = Ai = A1 + A2 + A3 . . .

   Don't sum columns three or four, since x¯i and y¯i are meaningless.

3. Combine the pieces to find the overall centroid.
   After you have filled in the whole table, you can find the coordinates of the
   centroid by applying (7.5.1) with the summary values from the last row.

x¯ = Qy  = 112.8 = 4.52 cm
      A     24.93

y¯ = Qx  = 41.86 = 1.692 cm
      A     24.93

Finally, plot the centroid (x¯, y¯) on the diagram. If you have made a calcu-
lation error it will usually be obvious, because the centroid location won't
"feel right."

    The next interactive shows a composite shape consisting of a large rectangle
with a smaller rectangle subtracted. You can change the location and size of the
rectangles by moving the red points. Use this to visualize how the centroids of
the whole is related to the centroid of the parts. Note that for objects divided
into two pieces, the centroid of the whole always falls on the line connecting the
centroids of the parts.

7.5.2 Centroids of 3D objects

Key Questions

   · How do you divide a composite solid into parts and compute the
       volume/mass and centroidal distances of each part?

   · What is the technique to compute the overall center of volume/mass
       for a composite solid?

    The centroid of a three-dimensional volume is found similarly to two-dimensional
centroids, but with volume used instead of area for the weighting factor. The
centroid of a volume and the center of mass or gravity for a homogenous solid
are identical.

        x¯ = x¯i Vi    y¯ = y¯i Vi    z¯ = z¯i Vi
                   Vi             Vi             Vi

Where,
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                                                              252

x¯, y¯, and z¯ are the coordinates of the centroid of the overall volume. Vi is
the volume of composite part i.

       x¯i, y¯i, and y¯i is the coordinates of the centroid of composite part i.

    Many three-dimensional shapes are just prismatic extrusions of the shapes.
The volume of a prism is the product of the cross-sectional area and the length of
the prism and is easily calculated. For example, the volume of a circular cylinder
with radius r and length l is V =  r2 l.

    If the density varies for each part of a composite solid, we can find the center
of mass by dividing the first moment of mass by the total mass. You can also
compute the center of gravity by replacing the mass terms in the equations below
with weight terms.

x¯ = x¯i mi    y¯ = y¯i mi                            z¯ = z¯i mi
           mi             mi                                     mi

Here mi is the mass of composite part i.
    You must always use the same weighting factor (area, volume, mass, weight,

etc) in both the numerator and denominator of the center of area/volume/mass/
weight equations.

We have actually found the coordinates of the center of gravity, but since
g is constant they are also coordinates of the center of mass.

7.6 Average Value of a Function

The weighted average technique discussed in (7.1.2) are a fine for averaging
several discrete values, but what do we do if we need to find the average of an
infinite number of values or values which change continuously?

    Consider a function y = f (x) over some interval from a to b. How can we
find the average value y¯ of the function over that interval? To understand what
is meant by the average value of a function, look at the interactive below. There,
the function f (x) is the red curve, and which you can change if you like. The blue
dots a and b mark the beginning and end of the interval and are also adjustable.

    The area under this curve between a and b is shaded with gray, and we can
find it using a definite integral

                                                                       b

                                                f (x) dx

                                                                     a

The blue hatched rectangle has the same area as the gray shaded region, and
because the areas are the same, the height of the rectangle y¯, is the average value
of f (x).

Live Link

Figure 7.6.1 The average value of a function between a and b.

    With this in mind, we can calculate the average value of f (x) by equating
the area under the curve with the area of the rectangle and solving for y¯.

  b                                            b

  f (x) dx = y¯(b - a)  and since dx = (b - a)

a                                            a

        b f (x) dx
y¯ = a

         (b - a)

        b f (x) dx
y¯ = a a

           b dx
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                       255

    This is a weighted average like (7.1.2) but instead of summing n discrete
values, we integrate of an infinite number of infinitesimal values. f (x) is the
value being averaged and the weighting function is dx.

    This approach is true for any choice of weighting function. To find x¯ for a
two dimensional area, the value to be averaged is x and the weighting function
is dA, so replacing dx with dA and xi with x,

x¯ = x¯iAi                                                 xdA
          Ai                    x¯ = dA

    In other words, to transform a discrete summation to an equivalent continu-
ous integral form you:

1. Replace the summation with integration,    .

2. Replace the discrete weighting factor with the corresponding differential

element,                   
                           Ai  dA

                           Vi  dV etc.
                             Wi  dW

3. Rename the value being averaged to eliminate the index i. We often use
   el as a subscript when referring to a differential element.

The two-dimensional centroid equations (7.5.1) become,

x¯ = x¯i Ai  x¯el dA               y¯ = y¯i Ai  y¯el dA
          Ai               dA                Ai               dA

, and in the same way the center of gravity equations become

            x¯ = x¯el dW       y¯ = y¯el dW      z¯ = z¯el dW
                       dW                dW                dW

.

Question 7.6.2

How far is it from the earth to the sun?

Answer. 92,958,412 miles

Solution. Siri says that "The average distance from the earth to the sun
is 92,958,412 miles."
That's a pretty exact answer. What does it mean, exactly? From what
point on the earth to what point on the sun?
If the earth and sun were perfect spheres, we could use the distance be-
tween their centroids. With more information about shape and density,
we could find their centers of mass and measure between those points.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY    256

The bigger problem is that this distance changes continuously as the earth
revolves around the sun. How can we find an average value for something
which is continuously changing?
We need to use the methods described here, integrating the distance as a
function of time over the course of a year.

7.7 Centroids using Integration

Key Questions
   · How do you find the centroid of an area using integration?

   · What is a differential quantity?

   · Why are double integrals required for square dA elements and single
       integrals required for rectangular dA elements?

    In this section we will use the integral form of (7.4.2) to find the centroids of
non-homogenous objects or shapes with curved boundaries.

x¯ = x¯el dA  y¯ = y¯el dA       z¯ = z¯el dA  (7.7.1)
          dA            dA                 dA

    With the integral equations we are mathematically breaking up a shape into
an infinite number of infinitesimally small pieces and adding them together by
integrating. This powerful method is conceptually identical to the discrete sums
we introduced first.

7.7.1 Integration Process

Determining the centroid of a area using integration involves finding weighted
average values x¯ and y¯, by evaluating these three integrals,

A = dA,       Qx = y¯el dA  Qy = x¯el dA       (7.7.2)

, where

   · dA is a differential bit of area called the element.

   · A is the total area enclosed by the shape, and is found by evaluating the
       first integral.

   · x¯el and y¯el are the coordinates of the centroid of the element. These are
       frequently functions of x or y, not constant values.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                    257

· Qx and Qy are the First moments of Area with respect to the x and y axis.

    The procedure for finding centroids with integration can be broken into three
steps:

1. Set up the integrals.

   Usually this is the hardest step.

   You should always begin by drawing a sketch of the problem and reviewing
   the given information.

   You will need to understand the boundaries of the shape, which may be
   lines or functions. You may need to know some math facts, like the defin-
   ition of slope, or the equation of a line or parabola. A bounding function
   may be given as a function of x, but you want it as a function of y, or
   vice-versa or it may have a constant which you will need to determine.

   You will need to choose an element of area dA. There are several choices
   available, including vertical strips, horizontal strips, or square elements; or
   in polar coordinates, rings, wedges or squares. There really is no right or
   wrong choice; they will all work, but one may make the integration easier
   than another. The best choice depends on the nature of the problem, and
   it takes some experience to predict which it will be.

Figure 7.7.1 Differential Elements of Area

The two most common choices for differential elements are:

· Square elements and double integrals.

   If you choose an infinitesimal square element dA = dx dy, you must
   integrate twice, over x and over y between the appropriate integration
   limits. The position of the element typically designated (x, y).

· Rectangular elements and single integrals.

   If you choose rectangular strips you eliminate the need to integrate
   twice. You may select a vertical element with a different width dx,
   and a height extending from the lower to the upper bound, or a
   horizontal strip with a differential height dy and a width extending
   from the left to the right boundaries. Either way, you only integrate
   once to cover the enclosed area.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  258

When finding the area enclosed by a single function y = f (x), and the
x and y axes (x, y) represents a point on the function and dA = y dx
for vertical strips, or dA = x dy for horizontal strips.

You must find expressions for the area dA and centroid of the element
(x¯el, y¯el) in terms of the bounding functions. This is how we turn an integral
over an area into a definite integral which can be integrated.

When you have established all these items, you can substitute them into
(7.7.2) and proceed to the integration step.

2. Solve the integrals.

   This step is pure mathematics.

   Here are some tips if you are doing integration "by hand". Be neat, work
   carefully, and check your work as you go along. Use proper mathematics
   notation: don't lose the differential dx or dy before the integration step,
   and don't include it afterwords. Don't forget to use equals signs between
   steps. Simplify as you go and don't substitute numbers or other constants
   too soon. Pay attention to units: Area A should have units of [length]2
   and the first moments of area Qx and Qy should have units of [length]3. If
   your units aren't consistent, then you have made a mistake.

3. Evaluate the centroid.

   After you have evaluated the integrals you will have expressions or values
   for A, Qx, and Qy. All that remains is to substitute these into the defining
   equations for x¯ and y¯ and simplify. Notice the Qx goes into the y¯ equation,
   and vice-versa.

x¯ = Qy  y¯ = Qx
      A        A

   Finally, plot the centroid at (x¯, y¯) on your sketch and decide if your answer
   makes sense for area.

Thinking Deeper 7.7.2 What is dA?

dA is just an area, but an extremely tiny one!
It's an example of an differential quantity--also called an infinitesi-
mal. A differential quantity is a value which is as close to zero as it can
possibly be without actually being zero. You can think of its value as 1 .
Integration is the process of adding up an infinite number of infinitesimal
quantities.
Some other differential quantities we will see in statics are dx, dy and dz,
which are infinitesimal increments of distance; dV , which is a differential
volume; dW , a differential weight; dm, a differential mass, and so on.
Any product involving a differential quantity is itself a differential quantity,
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  259

so if the area of a vertical strip is given by dA = y dx then, even though
height y is a real number, the area is a differential because dx is differential.
If you like, you can pronounce the d as "the little bit of" so dA = y dx
reads "The little bit of area is the height y times a little bit of x." and
A = dA reads "The total area is the sum of the little bits of area."

7.7.2 Area of a General Spandrel

In this section we will use the integration process describe above to calculate
the area of the general spandrel shown in Figure 7.7.3. A spandrel is the area
between a curve and a rectangular frame. This is a general spandrel because the
curve is defined by the function y = kxn, where n is not specified. If n = 0 the
function is constant, if n = 1 then it is a straight line, n = 2 it's a parabola, etc.
. You can change the slider to see the effect of different values of n.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  260

                Live Link

Figure 7.7.3 A general spandrel of the form y = kxn
    Begin by identifying the bounding functions. From the diagram, we see that

the boundaries are the function, the x axis and, the vertical line x = b. The
function y = kxn has a constant k which has not been specified, but which is
not arbitrary. The diagram indicates that the function passes through the origin
and point (a, b), and there is only one value of k which will cause this. We can
find k by substituting a and b into the function for x and y then solving for it.

                                              y = kxn
                                              b = kan

                                                     b
                                              k = an

    Next, choose a differential area. For this problem a vertical strip works well.
A vertical strip has a width dx, and extends from the bottom boundary to the
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                              261

top boundary. Any point on the curve is (x, y) and a point directly below it on
the x axis is (x, 0). This means that the height of the strip is (y - 0) = y and
the area of the strip is (base × height), so

              dA = y dx.

    The limits on the integral are from x = 0 on the left to x = a on the right

since we are integrating with respect to x.

    With these details established, the next step is to set up and evaluate the
integral A = dA = 0a y dx. This is the familiar formula from calculus for the
area under a curve. Proceeding with the integration

a

A = y dx                          (y = kxn)
                                 (integrate)
       0                  (evaluate limits)
         a
                                          b
= kxndx                            k = an

       0                             (result)

     n+1

b an+1      (simplify)

a n+1

        ab
A=

      n+1

    This result is not a number, but a general formula for the area under a curve
in terms of a, b, and n. Explore with the interactive, and notice for instance
that when n = 0, the shape is a rectangle and A = ab; when n = 1 the shape is
a triangle and the A = ab/2; when n = 2 the shape is a parabola and A = ab/3
etc. This single formula gives the equation for the area under a whole family of
curves.

Thinking Deeper 7.7.4 Which is better, horizontal or vertical elements?

Recall that the first moment of area Qx = x¯el dA is the distance weighted
area as measured from a desired axis. The distance term x¯el is the distance
from the desired axis to the centroid of each differential element of area,

dA.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                                                                              262

tal element but the computations are a bit more

Additionally, the distance to the centroid of each element, x¯el, must mea-
sure to the middle of the horizontal element. For this triangle,

                          x¯el = x .
                                 2

We find a similar contrast to finding the vertical centroidal distance y¯
where it is easier to use a dy element to find y¯ than it is to use a dx
element.

The interactive below compares horizontal and vertical strips for a shape
bounded by the parabola y2 = x and the diagonal line y = x - 2. Hor-
izontal strips are a better choice in this case, because the left and right
boundaries are easy to express as functions of y. If vertical strips are cho-
sen, the parabola must be expressed as two different functions of x, and
two integrals are needed to cover the area, the first from x = 0 to x = 1,
and the second from x = 1 to x = 4.

7.7.3 Examples

This section contains several examples of finding centroids by integration, start-
ing with very simple shapes and getting progressively more difficult. All the ex-
amples include interactive diagrams to help you visualize the integration process,
and to see how dA is related to x or y.

    The first two examples are a rectangle and a triangle evaluated three different
ways: with vertical strips, horizontal strips, and using double integration. The
different approaches produce identical results, as you would expect. You should
try to decide which method is easiest for a particular situation.

    Example 7.7.6 Centroid of a rectangle.

    Use integration to show that the centroid of a rectangle with a base b and
    a height of h is at its center.

Solution 1. This solution demonstrates solving integrals using vertical
rectangular strips. Set the slider on the diagram to h dx to see a represen-
tative element.

   1. Set up the integrals.
       The bounding functions in this example are vertical lines x = 0 and
       x = a, and horizontal lines y = 0 and y = h.
       The strip extends from (x, 0) on the x axis to (x, h) on the top of
       the rectangle, and has a differential width dx.
       The area of the strip is the base times the height, so
                                            dA = h dx.

       The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint so, by inspection

                                             x¯el = x
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                               265

                                 y¯el = h/2

   With vertical strips the variable of integration is x, and the limits on
   x run from x = 0 at the left to x = b on the right. For a rectangle,
   both 0 and h are constants, but in other situations, y¯el and the left
   or right limits may be functions of x.

2. Solve the integrals.

   Substitute dA, x¯el, and y¯el into (7.7.2) and integrate.

   A = dA                    Qx = y¯el dA           Qy = x¯el dA

                                                        =h
   A = bh                           h2b

                                                    Qy = 2

   Unsurprisingly, we learn that the area of a rectangle is base times
   height. Since the area formula is well known, it was not really nec-
   essary to solve the first integral. Note that A has units of [length]2,
   and Qx and Qy have units of [length]3.

3. Find the centroid.

   Substituting the results into the definitions gives

   x¯ = Qy                                       y¯ = Qx

Solution 2. This solution demonstrates solving integrals using horizon-
tal rectangular strips. Set the slider on the diagram to b dy to see a
representative element.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                                  266

1. Set up the integrals.
   The bounding functions x = 0, x = a, y = 0 and y = h.
   The strip extends from (0, y) on the y axis to (b, y) on the right, and
   has a differential height dy.
   The area of the strip is the base times the height, so

                                        dA = b dy.

   The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint so, by inspection

                                         x¯el = b/2
                                          y¯el = y

   With horizontal strips the variable of integration is y, and the limits
   on y run from y = 0 at the bottom to y = h at the top.
   For a rectangle, both 0 and h are constants, but in other situations,
   x¯el and the upper or lower limits may be functions of y.

2. Solve the integrals.
   Substitute dA, x¯el, and y¯el into (7.7.2) and integrate. The results are
   the same as we found using vertical strips.

   A = dA                   Qx = y¯el dA            Qy = x¯el dA

Solution 3. This solution demonstrates solving integrals using square
elements and double integrals. Set the slider on the diagram to dx dy to
see a representative element.

   1. Set up the integrals.
       Set the slider on the diagram to dx dy to see a representative element.
       The bounding functions x = 0, x = a, y = 0 and y = h.
       Instead of strips, the integrals will be evaluated using square ele-
       ments with width dx and height dy located at (x, y).
       The area of the square element is the base times the height, so

                                     dA = dx dy = dy dx.

The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint so, by inspection

                                       x¯el = x
                                       y¯el = y

   We will integrate twice, first with respect to y and then with respect
   to x. The limits on the first integral are y = 0 to h and x = 0 to b
   on the second. For a rectangle, both b and h are constants. In other
   situations, the upper or lower limits may be functions of x or y.

2. Solve the integrals.

   Substitute dA, x¯el, and y¯el into (7.7.2) and integrate the `inside'
   integral, then the `outside' integral. The results are the same as
   before.

Solution 1. This solution demonstrates finding the centroid of the tri-
angle using vertical strips dA = y dx. Set the slider on the diagram to
y dx to see a representative element.

1. Set up the integrals.

The bounding functions in this example are the x axis, the vertical

line x = b, and the straight line through the origin with a slope of bh .
Using the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line, the upper

bounding function is

                                            h
                             y = f (x) = x

                                            b

and any point on this line is designated (x, y).

The strip extends from (x, 0) on the x axis to (x, y) on the function,
has a height of y, and a differential width dx. The area of this strip
is

                                     dA = ydx.

The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint so, by inspection

                                 x¯el = x
                                 y¯el = y/2

   With vertical strips the variable of integration is x, and the limits
   are x = 0 to x = b.

2. Solve the integrals.

   Substitute dA, x¯el, and y¯el into (7.7.2) and integrate. In contrast to
   the rectangle example both dA and y¯el are functions of x, and will
   have to be integrated accordingly.

We learn that the area of a triangle is one half base times height.
Since the area formula is well known, it would have been more ef-
ficient to skip the first integral. Note that A has units of [length]2,
and Qx and Qy have units of [length]3.

Solution 2. This solution demonstrates solving integrals using horizon-
tal rectangular strips. Set the slider on the diagram to (b - x) dy to see a
representative element.

   1. Set up the integrals.
       As before, the triangle is bounded by the x axis, the vertical line
       x = b, and the line
                                         y = f (x) = h x.
                                                         b

       To integrate using horizontal strips, the function f (x) must be in-
       verted to express x in terms of y. Solving for f (x) for x gives

                                         x = g(y) = b y.
                                                        h

       The limits on the integral are from y = 0 to y = h.
       The strip extends from (x, y) to (b, y), has a height of dy, and a
       length of (b - x), therefore the area of this strip is

                                         dA = (b - x)dy.

The coordinates of the midpoint of the element are

   y¯el = y

   x¯el = x + (b - x) = b + x

CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                               271

These expressions are recognized as the average of the x and y coor-
dinates of strip's endpoints.

A common student mistake is to use dA = x dy, and x¯el = x/2.
These would be correct if you were looking for the properties of the
area to the left of the curve.

2. Solve the integrals.

Substitute dA, x¯el, and y¯el into the definitions of Qx and Qy and

integrate. The results are the same as we found using vertical strips.

There in no need to evaluate A =   dA  since   we       know  that  A  =  bh
                                                                          2

It makes solving these integrals easier if you avoid prematurely sub-
stituting in the function for x and if you factor out constants when-
ever possible. Here it x = g(y) was not substituted until the fourth
line.

Solution 3. This solution demonstrates solving integrals using square
elements and double integrals. Set the slider on the diagram to dx dy or
dy dx to see a representative element.

1. Set up the integrals.

   As before, the triangle is bounded by the x axis, the vertical line
   x = b, and the line

y = f (x) = h x or in terms of y, x = g(y) = b y.
b                                            h

In this solution the integrals will be evaluated using square differen-
tial elements dA = dy dx located at (x, y).

With double integration, you must take care to evaluate the limits
correctly, since the limits on the inside integral are functions of the
variable of integration of the outside integral. The inside integral
essentially stacks the elements into strips and the outside integral
adds all the strips to cover the area.

Choosing to express dA as dy dx means that the integral over y will
be conducted first. The limits on the inside integral are from y = 0
to y = f (x). Then, the limits on the outside integral are from x = 0
to x = b.

Using dA = dx dy would reverse the order of integration, so the
inside integral's limits would be from x = g(y) to x = b, and the
limits on the outside integral would be y = 0 to y = h. Either choice
will give the same results --if you don't make any errors!

The area of the square element is the base times the height, so

              dA = dy dx.

The centroid of the square is located at its midpoint so, by inspection

              x¯el = x
              y¯el = y

2. Solve the integrals.

   Substitute dA, x¯el, and y¯el into (7.7.2) and integrate the `inside'
   integral, then the `outside' integral. The results are the same as
   before.

Qx = y¯el dA  Qy = x¯el dA

Example 7.7.10 Centroid of a semi-parabola.

Find the coordinates of the centroid of a parabolic spandrel bounded by
the y axis, a horizontal line passing through the point (a, b), and a parabola
with a vertex at the origin and passing through the same point. a and b
are positive integers.

Solution. We will use (7.7.2) with vertical strips to find the centroid of
a spandrel.

   1. Set up the integrals.
       Determining the bounding functions and setting up the integrals
       is usually the most difficult part of problems like this. Begin by
       drawing and labeling a sketch of the situation.

         (a) Place a point in the first quadrant and label it P = (a, b). This
              point is in the first quadrant and fixed since we are told that a
              and b are positive integers

        (b) Place a horizontal line through P to make the upper bound.
         (c) Sketch in a parabola with a vertex at the origin and passing

              through P and shade in the enclosed area.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  275

 (d) Decide which differential element you intend to use. For this
      example we choose to use vertical strips, which you can see
      if you tick show strips in the interactive above. Horizontal
      strips dA = x dy would give the same result, but you would
      need to define the equation for the parabola in terms of y.

Determining the equation of the parabola and expressing it in terms
of x and any known constants is a critical step. You should remember
from algebra that the general equation of parabola with a vertex at
the origin is y = kx2, where k is a constant which determines the
shape of the parabola. If k > 0, the parabola opens upward and if
k < 0, the parabola opens downward.
To find the value of k, substitute the coordinates of P into the general
equation, then solve for k.

                                 y = kx2, so at P
                               (b) = k(a)2

                                        b
                                 k = a2

The resulting function of the parabola is

                                y = y(x) = a2b x2.

To perform the integrations, express the area and centroidal coordi-
nates of the element in terms of the points at the top and bottom of
the strip. The area of the strip is its height times its base, so

                                 dA = (b - y) dx.

If you incorrectly used dA = y dx, you would find the centroid of
the spandrel below the curve.
For vertical strips, the bottom is at (x, y) on the parabola, and the
top is directly above at (x, b). The strip has a differential width
dx. The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint and the
coordinates are found by averaging the x and y coordinates of the
points at the top and bottom.

                               x¯el = (x + x)/2 = x
                               y¯el = (y + b)/2

For vertical strips, the integrations are with respect to x, and the
limits on the integrals are x = 0 on the left to x = a on the right.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                        276

2. Solve the integrals.

   We have already established that y(x) = kx2 where k = b/a2. To
   simplify the algebra, it is best not to prematurely substitute y(x)
   and k, but you must substitute in any functions of x before you do
   the integration step.

A = dA                Qx = y¯eldA                 Qy = x¯eldA

Solution 1. This solution demonstrates finding the centroid of the area
between two functions using vertical strips dA = y dx. Set the slider on

       line x = b, and the straight line through the origin with a slope of bh .

   and any point on this line is designated (x, y).
   The strip extends from (x, 0) on the x axis to (x, y) on the function,
   has a height of y, and a differential width dx. The area of this strip
   is

                                        dA = ydx.

   The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint so, by inspection

                                         x¯el = x
                                         y¯el = y/2

   With vertical strips the variable of integration is x, and the limits
   are x = 0 to x = b.

2. Solve the integrals.

Solution 2. This solution demonstrates finding the centroid of the area
between two functions using vertical strips dA = y dx. Set the slider on
the diagram to h dx to see a representative element.

1. Set up the integrals.

The bounding functions in this example are the x axis, the vertical
line x = b, and the straight line through the origin with a slope of bh .
Using the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line, the upper

bounding function is

                                         h
                          y = f (x) = x

                                         b

and any point on this line is designated (x, y).

The strip extends from (x, 0) on the x axis to (x, y) on the function,
has a height of y, and a differential width dx. The area of this strip
is

                                     dA = ydx.

The centroid of the strip is located at its midpoint so, by inspection

                               x¯el = x
                               y¯el = y/2

With vertical strips the variable of integration is x, and the limits
are x = 0 to x = b.

    The last example demonstrates using double integration with polar coordi-
nates.

   Example 7.7.14 Centroid of a semi-circle.

   Find the coordinates of the top half of a circle with radius r, centered at
   the origin.

               Live Link

Figure 7.7.15

Solution. We will use (7.7.2) with polar coordinates (, ) to solve this
problem because they are a natural fit for the geometry. In polar coordi-
nates, the equation for the bounding semicircle is simply

                                            = r.

Normally this involves evaluating three integrals but as you will see, we
can take some shortcuts in this problem. Otherwise we will follow the
same procedure as before.

   1. Set up the integrals.
       Divide the semi-circle into "rectangular" differential elements of area
       dA, as shown in the interactive when you select Show element. This
       shape is not really a rectangle, but in the limit as d and d approach
       zero, it doesn't make any difference.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  282

The radial height of the rectangle is d and the tangential width is
the arc length d. The product is the differential area dA.

dA = (d)( d) =  d d.                         (7.7.3)

   The differential element is located at (, ) in polar coordinates. Ex-
   pressing this point in rectangular coordinates gives

                                       x¯el =  cos 
                                        y¯el =  sin 

   .

2. Solve the integrals.
   The area of a semicircle is well known, so there is no need to actually
   evaluate A = dA,
                                   A = dA = r2 .
                                                       2

   Since the semi-circle is symmetrical about the y axis,

Qy = x¯el dA = 0.

This is because each element of area to the right of the y axis is bal-
anced by a corresponding element the same distance the left which
cancel each other out in the sum.

All that remains is to evaluate the integral Qx in the numerator of

   y¯ = Qx = y¯el dA
         A      A

The differential area dA is the product of two differential quantities,
we will need to perform a double integration.

Qx = y¯eldA

3. Find the centroid.
   Substituting the results into the definitions gives

                                  y¯ = Qx
                                         A
                                        2r3 r2

                                     =
                                         32
                                        4r

                                     =
                                        3

.
So x¯ = 0 and lies on the axis of symmetry, and y¯ = 4r above the
diameter. 3

This result can be extended by noting that a semi-circle is mirrored
quarter-circles on either side of the y axis. These must have the same
y¯ value as the semi-circle. Further, quarter-circles are symmetric
about a 45 line, so for the quarter-circle in the first quadrant,

   x¯ = y¯ = 4r .

7.8 Distributed Loads

   Key Questions
       · What is a distributed load?
       · Given a distributed load, how do we find the magnitude of the equiv-
           alent concentrated force?
       · Given a distributed load, how do we find the location of the equiva-
           lent concentrated force?

    Distributed loads are forces which are spread out over a length, area, or
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  284

volume. Most real-world loads are distributed, including the weight of building
materials and the force of wind, water, or earth pushing on a surface. Pressure,
load, weight density and stress are all names commonly used for distributed
loads. Distributed load is a force per unit length or force per unit area depicted
with a series of force vectors joined together at the top, and will be designated
as w(x) to indicate that the distributed loading is a function of x.

    For example, although a shelf of books could be treated as a collection of
individual forces, it is more common and convenient to represent the weight of
the books as a uniformly distributed load. A uniformly distributed load is
a load which has the same value everywhere, i.e.w(x) = C, a constant.

                         (a) A shelf of books with various weights.

                         (b) Each book represented as an individ-
                         ual weight

                         (c) All the books represented as a dis-
                         tributed load.
Figure 7.8.1
    We can use the computational tools discussed in the previous chapters to
handle distributed loads if we first convert them to equivalent point forces. This
equivalent replacement must be the resultant of the distributed loading, as
discussed in Section 4.7. Recall that this resultant force has the same external
effect on the object as the original system of forces did.
    To be equivalent, the point force must have a:
   · Magnitude equal to the area or volume under the distributed load function.
   · Line of action that passes through the centroid of the distributed load
       distribution.
    The next two sections will explore how to find the magnitude and location
of the equivalent point force for a distributed load.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY           285

7.8.1 Equivalent Magnitude

The magnitude of the distributed load of the books is the total weight of the
books divided by the length of the shelf

                                          w(x) = Wi .
                                                       

It represents the average book weight per unit length. Similarly, the total weight
of the books is equal to the value of the distributed load times the length of the
shelf or

                                      W = w(x)
                         total weight = weight × length of shelf

                                             length

    This total load is simply the area under the curve w(x), and has units of
force. If the loading function is not uniform, integration may be necessary to
find the area.

Example 7.8.2 Bookshelf.

A common paperback is about 3 cm thick and weighs approximately 3 N.
What is the loading function w(x) for a shelf full of paperbacks and what
is the total weight of paperback books on a 6 m shelf?

Solution. The weight of one paperback over its thickness is the load

intensity w(x), so

                        w(x) = 3 N = 100 N/m.
                                  3 cm

The total weight is the area under the load intensity diagram, which in this

case is a rectangle. So, a 6 m bookshelf covered with paperbacks would

have to support

                 W = w(x) = (100 N/m)(6 m) = 600 N.

The line of action of this equivalent load passes through the centroid of
the rectangular loading, so it acts at x = 3 m.

                              100 N/m

                    6m    3m                   3m

                                               600 N

7.8.2 Equivalent Location

To use a distributed load in an equilibrium problem, you must know the equiv-
alent magnitude to sum the forces, and also know the position or line of action
to sum the moments.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  286

    The line of action of the equivalent force acts through the centroid of area
under the load intensity curve. For a rectangular loading, the centroid is in the
center. We know the vertical and horizontal coordinates of this centroid, but
since the equivalent point force's line of action is vertical and we can slide a force
along its line of action, the vertical coordinate of the centroid is not important
in this context.

    Similarly, for a triangular distributed load -- also called a uniformly vary-
ing load-- the magnitude of the equivalent force is the area of the triangle, bh/2
and the line of action passes through the centroid of the triangle. The horizontal
distance from the larger end of the triangle to the centroid is x¯ = b/3.

    Essentially, we're finding the balance point so that the moment of the force
to the left of the centroid is the same as the moment of the force to the right.

    The examples below will illustrate how you can combine the computation
of both the magnitude and location of the equivalent point force for a series of
distributed loads.

   Example 7.8.3 Uniformly Varying Load.

      10 lb/ft      Find the equivalent point force and
                its point of application for the distributed

      x         load shown.

6 ft

   Solution. The equivalent load is the `area' under the triangular load
   intensity curve and it acts straight down at the centroid of the triangle.
   This triangular loading has a 6 ft base and a10 lb/ft height so

                           W = 1 bh = 1 (6 ft)(10 lb/ft) = 30 lb.
                                  22

   and the centroid is located 2/3 of the way from the left end so,

                                             x¯ = 4 ft.

    Distributed loads may be any geometric shape or defined by a mathematical
function. If the load is a combination of common shapes, use the properties of
the shapes to find the magnitude and location of the equivalent point force using
the methods of Section 7.5. If the distributed load is defined by a mathematical
function, integrate to find their area using the methods of Section 7.7.

    A few things to note:

   · You can include the distributed load or the equivalent point force on your
       free-body diagram, but not both!

   · Since you're calculating an area, you can divide the area up into any shapes
       you find convenient. So, if you don't recall the area of a trapezoid off the
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                                 287

top of your head, break it up into a rectangle and a triangle.

7.8.3 Distributed Load Applications

Once you convert distributed loads to the resultant point force, you can solve
problem in the same manner that you have other problems in previous chapters
of this book. Note that while the resultant forces are externally equivalent to the
distributed loads, they are not internally equivalent, as will be shown Chapter 8.

            4 m x nection at A.

Solution. Draw a free-body diagram with the distributed load replaced
with an equivalent concentrated load, then apply the equations of equilib-
rium.

                                     Fx = 0  Ax = 0

Solution. Start by drawing a free-body diagram of the beam with the
two distributed loads replaced with equivalent concentrated loads. The
two distributed loads are (10 in)(12 lb/in) = 120 lb each.

           120 lb              100 lb 150 lb 100 lb  120 lb

Then apply the equations of equilibrium.

      -(150 lb)(12 in) - (100 lb)(18 in)                  By = 393.3 lb

7.9 Fluid Statics

Key Questions
   · What is the basic relationship between depth and pressure?

   · How are absolute and relative pressure different?

   · How can use our knowledge of centroids to compute the equivalent
       point forces of fluids?

Pressure is the term used for a force distributed over an area

                           P = F.                                        (7.9.1)
                                 A

We will consider the effect of fluid pressure on underwater surfaces, including
slanted or curved objects. In all cases we will simply ask the question: what is
the pressure at each point and how does it change along the surface?

    Pressure can be measured in two different ways

· Absolute pressure is the pressure measured above an absolute or perfect
   vacuum. The absolute pressure of the surrounding atmosphere is approxi-
   mately 101.3 kPa or 14.7 lb/in2, and a perfect vacuum is 0 psi or 0 kPa.

· Gage pressure is the pressure indicated by a standard pressure gage. The
   gage reads zero when exposed directly to the atmosphere, positive when
   the pressure is higher than atmospheric pressure, and negative pressure
   indicates a vacuum. In effect, pressure gages ignores the pressure of the
   atmosphere which surrounds us.

We will use gage pressure for the remainder of the chapter.
Commonly used pressure units include:

· 1 pascals (Pa) = 1 N/m2
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                                   289

· 1 kilopascal (kPa) = 1000 N/m2
· 1 pound per square inch (psi) = lb/in2
· 1 kip per square inch (ksi) = 1000 lb/in2
· 1 pound per square foot (psf) = 1 lb/ft2

7.9.1 Principles of Fluid Statics

A fluid, like water or air exerts a pressure on its surroundings. This pressure

applies a distributed load on surfaces surrounding the fluid, like the face of a

dam, an irrigation control gate, a teakettle, or the drum of a steam boiler.

When you dive underwater, the pressure you feel in your ears increases with

depth. At the surface, the gage pressure is zero no matter which unit system

you use. As you descend, the fluid pressure P increases with depth according to

the equation

                               P = gh,                         (7.9.2)

where:

·  is the density of a fluid,

· g is gravitational acceleration, and

· h is the height of fluid above the point of interest.

    Since fluid pressure increases linearly with depth, it behaves as a distributed
load which increases linearly from 0 at the surface to gh at depth h, acting
normal to the surface. The pressure can be replaced with an equivalent force
acting through the centroid of the triangular loading, with a magnitude equal
to the triangular area. The pressure on horizontal surfaces is constant, and it is
normal to all surfaces.

Figure 7.9.1 Pressure on submerged surfaces.

Some points to remember when solving fluid pressure problems.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY        290

1. The pressure due to the fluid always acts perpendicular the surface.

2. A particle underwater will feel the same pressure from all directions.

3. Pressure increases linearly with depth. P = gh

4. P = gh assumes a constant density and thus is valid only for incompress-
   ible fluids like water or oil, but not for compressible fluids like air.

5. In English units, specific weight  is often used instead of density  to
   describe fluids. Specific weight is the weight per unit volume of a substance,
   while density is its mass per unit volume. The two properties are related
   by  = g. The specific weight of freshwater at room temperature is about
   62.4 lb/ft3.

6. Gage pressure is the pressure above the surrounding atmospheric pressure.
   Atmospheric pressure is approximately 14.7 lb/in2 or 101.3 kPa, but since
   this pressure acts on everything equally and from all directions, the pres-
   sure scale can be offset to make the pressure of the surroundings 0 lb/in2,
   gage.

Question 7.9.2

Does fluid pressure depend on the surface area of the container? For
instance, is the pressure below the Atlantic Ocean less than the pressure
below the Pacific Ocean since the Pacific is larger?
Answer. No. Fluid pressure is a function of density and depth only, so
the surface area of an ocean or tank is insignificant.

                                         P = gh.

Assuming that the density of seawater and g are the same everywhere
under the ocean, the gage pressure depends on depth only.

Question 7.9.3

Compare the pressure at three feet and thirty feet below the surface of
freshwater to the atmospheric pressure.
Answer. The gage pressure at 3 ft is

            p = d = 62.4 lb/ft3 × 3 ft = 187 lb/ft2 = 1.30 lb/in2.

This is         14.7 lb/in2 + 1.3 lb/in2 = 1.088,
                        14.7 lb/in2

approximately 9% greater than atmospheric pressure.
At 30 ft below the surface, the pressure is 10 times higher, 13.0 lb/in2
which is nearly twice atmospheric pressure.

   Example 7.9.4 Force on a submerged window.
                                                              3m
         An aquarium tank has a 3 m × 1.5 m window       B
    AB for viewing the inhabitants. The tank contains
    water with density  = 1000 kg/m3.

         Find the force of the water on the window, and
     the location of the equivalent point load.

Solution. Begin by drawing a diagram of the window showing the load
intensity and the equivalent concentrated force.

                                                                               a=2m

                                                                               b=3m
                                                                                                            F

The pressure at the top and the bottom of the window are

                            PA =  g(2 m) = 19620 N/m2
                            PB =  g(5 m) = 49050 N/m2

Since the loading is linear, the average pressure acting on the window is

                                  Pave = (PA + PB)/2
                                        = 34300 N/m2

The total force acting on the window is the average pressure times the
area of the window

                               F = (Pave)(3 m × 1.5 m)
                                  = 155 kN

This force may also be visualized as the volume of a trapezoidal prism
with a 1.5 m depth into the page.
The line of action of the equivalent force passes through the centroid of the
trapezoid, which may be calculated using composite areas, see Section 7.5.
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY        292

Dividing the trapezoid into a triangle and a rectangle and measuring down
from the surface of the tank, the distance to the equivalent force is

d = Aiy¯i                 1 (PB - PA)(3 m)  (4 m)
          Ai              2

       PA(3 m) (3.5 m) +  2
d=

               PA(3 m) +

d = 3.71 m

If you prefer, you may use the formula from the Centroid table to locate
the centroid of the trapezoid instead.

Example 7.9.5 Mud on Concrete Wall.

    A concrete retaining wall 3 m tall and 0.8 m
thick encloses wet clay mud.

    Find the maximum depth h of mud that can
be retained without tipping the wall.

    Assume the density of mud is 1760 kg/m3
and the density of concrete is 2400 kg/m3.

Solution. Begin by drawing free-body diagram of the wall, showing the
forces acting on it: the weight of the concrete Wc, acting at the center
of gravity of the rectangular wall, the horizontal force F due to the mud,
and the reaction components at A. Define symbol Dz for the unspecified
length of the wall into the page.

The weight of the concrete is found by multiplying the weight density of
concrete c = c g by the volume of the rectangular wall.

                                Wc = c V
                                     = (c g) (DxDyDz)

The horizontal force is caused by the hydraulic pressure of the mud on
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY                             293

the submerged face of the wall. The pressure is a distributed load that
increases linearly from zero at the surface to Pmax = m g h at depth
h. Since the loading is triangular, the average pressure is one-half the
maximum pressure, and the resulting force is:

                                                   1
                                 F = PaveA = 2 PmaxA

                                        1
                                    = 2 (m g h)(hDz)

The wall will tip if the counter-clockwise moment due to F is greater
than the clockwise moment caused by the concrete's weight. By taking
moments about point A, we can find the maximum allowable height of the
mud, h. Note that the length of the dam and g appear on both sides and
cancel out.

Example 7.9.6 Sea Gate.

    A sea gate is hinged at point A and is de-       Ad
signed to rotate and release the water when                     500 mm
the depth d exceeds a certain value.
                                                            B
    The gate extends 2 m into the page. The
mass density of the water is  = 1000 kg/m3.

    What depth will cause the gate to open?

Solution. For the gate to tip, the equivalent force of the water must
act at or above A. That happens when the centroid of the load intensity
diagram of the water is at or above A, so

                                      d  500 mm

is fabricated from three 125 kg, 0.6 m × 1 m
rectangular steel plates. The gate is hinged                       C            B
at A and rests against a frictionless support       d                                  0.6 m
at D. The depth of the water d is 0.75 m.
                                                                                A
    Draw the free-body diagram and deter-
mine the reactions at A and D.

Solution.

    A free-body diagram of a cross section of       WW
the gate is shown. For simplicity the thick-0.45 m
ness of the steel plates has been ignored. You                        W
should ensure that sufficient distances are 0.15 m
provided to locate the loads.                       0.3 m 0.3 m

    The easiest way to solve this is to apply
the principle of transmissibility: slide the 0.6 m
lower trapezoid left until it aligns with the
upper triangle and makes a triangular load-
ing.

The total horizontal force from the water will be

   Fx = Pave A                                      (0.75 m × 1 m)
       = 1  g 0.75 m (0.75 m × 1 m)
            2
       = 1 (1000 kg/m3)(9.81 m/s2) 0.75 m
            2
       = 2760 N

acting to the right 0.25 m above point A.
The total vertical load from the water is

   Fy = Pave A
       = [ g (0.15 m)](0.6 m × 1 m)
       = [(1000 kg/m3)(9.81 m/s2) (0.15 m)](0.6 m × 1 m)
       = 882.9 N

acting upward 0.3 m to the left of A.
Each plate weighs

   W = mg
CHAPTER 7. CENTROIDS AND CENTERS OF GRAVITY  295

         = (125 kg)(9.81 m/s2)
         = 1226 N

.
From here solve the equilibrium equations to find the reactions. You should
complete this for practice.

MA = 0   =  Dx = 239 N 
 Fx = 0
 Fy = 0  =  Ax = 2998 N

Internal Forces

One of the fundamental assumptions we make in statics is that bodies are rigid,
that is, they do not deform, bend, or change shape. While we know that this
assumption is not true for real materials, we are building the analytical tools
necessary to analyze deformation. In this chapter you will learn to compute the
forces and moments inside a object which hold it together as it supports its own
weight and any applied loads.

    The chapter begins with a discussion of internal forces and moments and
defines a new sign conventions especially for them. Next we will determine
internal forces at a specific point within a rigid body. Finally, we develop three
techniques to find internal forces at every point throughout a beam. Note that
we use the words internal forces when we are referring to both "internal forces
and internal bending moments."

    Determination of the internal forces is the first step in the engineering design
of a structure. A properly designed structure must safely support all expected
external loads, including live loads, dead loads, wind and earthquake loads. Ex-
ternal loads produce internal forces, which in turn creates stresses, strains, and
deformations in the structure. In a successful design, the shape, size, and mate-
rial must all be carefully chosen to limit them to safe values. You are advised
to pay attention, and master this topic.

8.1 Internal Forces

In Subsection 3.3.3 you were introduced to axial loadings, which were either
tension or compression, or possibly zero. This section will explain two other
internal forces found in two-dimensional systems, the internalshear and inter-
nalbending moment.

    Internal forces are present at every point within a rigid body, but they always
occur in equal-and-opposite pairs which cancel each other out, so they're not
obvious. They're there however, and when an object is cut (in your imagination)
into two parts the internal forces become visible and can be determined.

                                                 298
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES        299

    You are familiar with straight, two-force members which only exist in equi-
librium if equal and opposite forces act on either end. Now imagine that we
cut the member at some point along its length. To maintain equilibrium, forces
must exist at the cut, equal and opposite to the external forces. These forces
are internal forces.

                Live Link

Figure 8.1.1 Internal forces in a straight two-force member.
    Now let's examine the two-force member shown in Figure 8.1.2. This time,

the member is L shaped, not straight, but the external forces must still share the
same line of action to maintain equilibrium. If you cut across the object, you will
obtain two rigid bodies which must also be in equilibrium. However, adding an
equal and opposite horizontal force at the cut won't produce static equilibrium
because the two forces form a couple which causes the piece to rotate. This
means that something is missing!

   F                        F

      FF

F                              F

Figure 8.1.2 A horizontal force alone does not create equilibrium.

    Two-dimensional rigid bodies have three degrees-of-freedom and require three
equilibrium equations to satisfy static equilibrium in order to prevent translation
in the x direction, the y direction, and to prevent rotation about the z axis.

    Assuming the material is rigid, the connection between the two halves must
resist both translation and rotation, so we can model this connection as a fixed
support and replace the removed half of the link with a force reaction and a
couple-moment reaction as shown in the free-body diagrams of Figure 8.1.3. This
internal loading is actually a simplification of a more complex loading distributed
across the section plane. The couple M represents the net rotational effect of
the force system on the surface of the cut.

force V, and bending moment M

    The internal force component perpendicular to the cut is called the normal
force. This is the same internal tension or compression force that we assumed
to be the only significant internal load for trusses. If the object has an axis, and
the cut is perpendicular to it, the normal force may also be properly called an
axial force.

    The internal force component parallel to the cut is called the shear force.
The word shear refers to the shearing that occurs between adjacent planes due
to this force. You can get a feel for shearing adjacent planes by sliding two pieces
of paper together.

    The internal couple-moment is called the bending moment because it tends
to bend the material by rotating the cut surface.

    The shear force is often simply referred to as shear, and the bending moment
as moment; together with the normal or axial force the three together are
referred to as the "internal forces". The symbol V is commonly chosen for the
shear force, and A, P or N for the normal force and M for the bending moment.

Thinking Deeper 8.1.6 Deformation.

The controlling design parameter for most engineering systems is deforma-
tion. Thankfully, due to a property called elasticity, most materials will
bend, stretch, and compress, long before they ultimately break. For exam-
ple, when designing the floor in a new building, the floor is often limited
to deflecting less than the length of the span in inches, divided by 360.
Any more deformation than this would be considered disconcerting to the
building residents and also start damaging surface materials like drywall.
For example, for a 20 ft span, the deflection would need to be less than

              20 ft · 12 in
                 1 ft = 0.667 in.
           =  360

To meet this deformation limit, we need to consider the magnitude and
location of applied loads, the size and shape of the floor beams, and the
material the floor beams are made from. As deflection is an internal prop-
erty of the flooring materials, the first step is to determine the internal
forces that arise from the externally applied loads, using the methods of
this chapter.

8.2 Sign Conventions

When talking about internal forces our standard sign convention for forces and
moments is not good enough. We can't, for instance, just call a vertical shear
force positive if it points up and negative if it points down, because internal
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES  302

forces always occur in pairs so at any given point a shear force is both up and
down. The direction of the internal force at a point depends on which side of
the cut you're looking at.

    So to define the state of internal forces at a point we need a better sign
convention. Although the choice is somewhat arbitrary, agreeing on a standard
sign convention allows us to have consistency across our calculations and to
communicate the internal state clearly to others. The standard sign conventions
defined here are used for internal loadings at a point and also for the shear and
bending moment diagrams which are discussed in Section 8.4.

    Be aware that although this new sign convention applies to internal forces,
it doesn't change the sign convention for the equations of equilibrium at all, so
you will continue to solve them in the same way you always have.

    The standard sign convention used for shear force, normal force, and bending
moment is shown below.

   · Positive Shear.

                                        Positive shear forces tend to skew an object as
                                    shown, i.e. positive shear forces push down when
                                    looking from the right, and up when looking from
                                    the left.

   · Positive Normal Force.

                                        Positive normal forces tend to stretch the object.

· Positive Bending Moment.
                                    Positive bending moments tend to deform the

                                object with an upward curvature.

Question 8.2.1

We have defined positive internal forces by looking at the "front" side of
the object. Would the results change if you walked around the object and
analyzed it from the other side?

8.3 Internal Forces at a Point

This section covers the procedure to compute the internal normal force, shear
force, and bending moment at a designated point in a multi-force rigid body.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                                    303

Consider the frame shown in Figure 8.3.1(a)

consisting of two-force members GD and BE,              D

and multi-force members AD and CF . Since no               E  F
information is provided, we can assume that the
                                                        C

components have negligible weight. The internal

loading within the two-force members is purely          B

axial, but the multi-force members will be sub-               W

ject to the complete set of shear force, normal

force, and bending moment.                           G  A

To find the internal forces at a specified point

within one of the members, we make an imagi-
                                                             (a) A frame supporting a load at

nary cut there. F .
    Figure 8.3.1(b) shows the free-body diagram

of member AD, with a proposed cut between

points D and C. The free-body diagram is

shown with reactions for pinned connections at

A and C and forces from the two-force members

at locations B and D.

We then separate the free-body diagram of

the member into two independent free-body dia-

grams, one above the cut and one below. This is

analogous to the Method of Sections technique

of Chapter 6. The free-body diagrams for the

two sections of the member are shown in Fig(-b) Wavy line indicates the loca-
ure 8.3.1(c). The three internal forces are ex-tion of the imaginary cut.
posed and labeled V , N , and M . Either free-

body diagram can be used to solve for the in-

ternal forces, so it is wise to choose the easier

one. Recognizing which one is easier takes prac-

tice, but look for the piece with more known and

fewer unknown values.

Note that the internal forces at the cut are

drawn in the positive direction according to the

sign conventions for internal forces, that they act

in opposite direction either side of the cut, and

they cancel out if the object is put back together.

    This technique can be used to find the inter(-c) Internal forces are exposed

examples below we will find the internal loadings
at a specific point in load carrying beams. Figure 8.3.1
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                                          304

Example 8.3.2 Internal forces in a simply supported beam.

    A beam of length L is supported by a pin                  w
at A and a roller at B and is subjected to a
horizontal force F applied to point B and                  B     F
a uniformly distributed load over its entire A
length. The intensity of the distributed load          L
is w with units of [force/length].

Find the internal forces at the midpoint of the beam.
Solution.

1. Find the external reactions.

    Begin by drawing a free-body dia-                     wL
gram of the entire beam, simplified by
replacing the distributed load w with an                                        F
equivalent concentrated load at the cen-                                  B
troid of the rectangle.

The magnitude of the equivalent load W is equal to the "area" under
the rectangular loading curve.

                                 W = w(L)

Then apply and simplify the equations of equilibrium to find the
external reactions at A and B.

                                        MA = 0
                     -(wL)(L/2) + (B)L = 0

                                             B = wL/2

      Fx = 0
-Ax + F = 0

        Ax = F

                                              Fy = 0
                                Ay - wL + By = 0

                                               Ay = wL - wL/2
                                                    = wL/2

2. Cut the beam.
   Cut the beam at the point of interest and separate the beam into two
   sections. Notice that as the beam is cut in two, the distributed load
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES         305

w is cut as well. Each of these distributed load halves will support
equivalent point loads of wL/2 acting through the centroid of each
cut half.

                                                                        F

                                                                   B

                                                                       w
                                                                            F

                                   L/2 L/2 B

3. Add the internal forces.
   At each cut, a shear force, a normal force, and a bending moment
   will be exposed, and these need to be included on the free-body
   diagram.
   At this point, we don't know the actual directions of the internal
   forces, but we do know that they act in opposite directions. We will
   assume that they act in the positive sense as defined by the standard
   sign convention.
   Axial forces are positive in tension and act in opposite directions on
   the two halves of the cut beam.
   Positive shear forces act down when looking at the cut from the
   right, and up when looking at the cut from the left. An alternate
   definition of positive shears is that the positive shears cause clockwise
   rotation. This definition is useful if you are dealing with a vertical
   column instead of a horizontal beam.
   Bending moments are positive when the moment tends to bend the
   beam into a smiling U-shape. Negative moments bend the beam
   into a frowning shape.
   For vertical columns, positive bending moments bend a beam into a
   C shape and negative into a backward C-shape.
   The final free-body diagrams look like this.

                                F
                            B
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                                         306

   Horizontal beams should always have assumed internal loadings in
   these directions at the cut, indicating that you have assumed positive
   shear, positive normal force and positive bending moments at that
   point.

4. Solve for the internal forces.
   You may uses either fbd to find the internal forces using the tech-
   niques you have already learned. So, with a standard xy coordi-
   nate system, forces to the right or up are positive when summing
   forces and counter-clockwise moments are positive when summing
   moments.
   Using the left free-body diagram and substituting in the reactions,
   we get:

                                                 Fx = 0
                                          -Ax + N = 0

                                                   N = Ax

                                                 Fy = 0
                                 Ay - wL/2 - V = 0

                                                    V = wL/2 - wL/2
                                                    V =0

                                          Mcut = 0
          (wL/2)(L/4) - (Ay)(L/2) + M = 0

                                               M = -wL2/8 + wL2/4
                                               M = wL2/8

Using the right side free-body diagram we get:

                                              Fx = 0
                                        -N + F = 0

                                                 N =F

               Fy = 0
V - wL/2 + By = 0

                  V = wL/2 - By
                  V = wL/2 - wL/2
                  V =0
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                                                   307

                                  Mcut = 0

-M - (L/4)(wL/2) + (L/2)(By) = 0
                                       M = -wL2/8 + wL2/4
                                       M = wL2/8

    Regardless of which side is chosen, we get the same results for the internal
forces at the chosen point.

    When you solve for the internal forces, the results can be either positive,
negative, or sometimes zero. Negative values indicate that the actual direction of
the load is opposite to the assumed direction. Since we assumed all three internal
forces were positive as defined by the standard sign convention, a negative answer
means that the load actually acts in the opposite direction to the vector shown
on the free-body diagram.

Example 8.3.3 Internal forces in a cantilever beam.

Consider a cantilever beam which                               P
                                                                   B
is supported by a fixed connection at

and horizontal force F at the free end

                                                                          F
        Draw an fbd of the entire, un-

   tions.

Notice that only the applied loads and support reactions are included
on this uncut beam fbd. The internal forces are only exposed and
shown on a fbd after the beam is cut.

Use this free-body diagram and the equations of equilibrium to de-
termine the external reaction forces.

 Fx = 0                                 =            Ax = F
 Fy = 0
MA = 0                                  =            Ay = P

                                        =            MA = P L

2. Section the beam.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                            308

Take a cut at the point of interest and draw a fbd of either or both
parts. Try to choose the simpler free-body diagram. If one side has
no external reactions, then you can skip the previous step if you
choose that side.

                                        F

   The free-body diagrams of both portions have been drawn with the
   internal forces and moments drawn in the positive direction defined
   by the standard sign convention.

   The axial force is shown in tension on both parts. This force has
   been named N so its name doesn't conflict with the forces at point
   A.

   The shear force V is positive when the shear is down on the right
   face of the cut and up on the left face.

   The bending moment M is positive if the bending direction would
   tend to bend the beam into a concave upward curve.

   Always assume that the unknown internal forces act in the positive
   direction as defined by the standard sign convention.

3. Solve for the internal forces.

   Selecting the right hand diagram and solving for the unknown inter-
   nal forces gives:

  Fx = 0 = N = F                  from before F = Ax
  Fy = 0 = V = P                  from before P = Ay
Mcut = 0 = M = -P b = -P (L - a)  since a + b = L

. Solving the other free-body diagram would produce the same re-
sults

Once you have found the reactions and drawn a free-body diagram of
the simpler portion with the normal force, shear force, and bending
moment assumed positive, you then solve for the unknown values
and signs just like any other equilibrium problem.

This workflow typically includes:
· Establishing a horizontal x and vertical y coordinate system.
· Taking a cut at the point of interest.
· Assuming that the internal forces act in the positive direction and drawing
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES  309

       a free-body diagram accordingly

   · Using Fx = 0, Fy = 0, and Mz = 0 to solve for the three unknown
       internal forces.

    The shear force V , normal force N , and bending moment M are scalar com-
ponents and they may be positive, zero, or negative depending on the applied
loads. The signs of the scalar components together with the sign convention for
internal forces establish the actual directions of the shear force, normal force
and bending moment vectors.

8.3.1 Interactive Internal Forces

The internal forces and bending moments inside a beam depend on the load that
the beam is supporting and differ from point to point. This simply supported
beam supports a uniformly varying load. The interactive traces out the value
of the shear and bending moment as you move point C. Can you deduce the
relation between the triangular loading and the value of the shear and bending
moment?
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES  310

                Live Link

Figure 8.3.4 Internal forces in a beam with a uniformly varying load.

8.4 Shear and Bending Moment Diagrams

Shear and moment diagrams are graphs which plot the internal shear and bend-
ing moment against the length of the beam.

    They allow us to see the internal forces throughout the entire beam so that
we can optimize the design to prevent failures and reduce the overall weight and
cost of the structure. A beam is most likely to fail at points where shear and
moment are greatest and these diagrams help us find these points.

    The previous section presented a method to find the internal forces at a
single point, which is useful; but to find the shear and moment at every point we
need a more powerful approach. The following sections discuss three different
methods to produce shear and bending moment diagrams, and concludes with
a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

    Beams can be supported in a variety of ways as shown in Figure 8.4.1. The
common support methods are
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                              311

· Simply Supported Supported by a pin on one end and a roller at the
   other.

· Cantilevered Fixed at one end, and unsupported at the other.

· Overhanging One or both ends overhang the supports.

(a) Simply Supported (b) Cantilevered  (c) Overhanging

Figure 8.4.1 Beam Supports

    We will limit our analysis to these three support systems, and since beams
primarily support vertical loads, axial forces will not be considered in this sec-
tion.

8.5 Relations between Loading, Shear and Mo-

     ment

Shear and bending moment diagrams are used to show how load on a beam
affects the shear and bending moment within.

    In this section, we will look at a completely general beam and loading, and use
a free-body diagram and the principles of equlibrium to derive the fundamental
mathematical relationships that exist between load, shear, and bending moment.

    Then in the sections to follow, we will learn three methods to produce shear
and bending moment diagrams: an equilibrium based approach, a graphical
integration method, and a calculus-based analytical approach. All three methods
are consistent with the equations derived in this section and understanding them
all can be insightful.

    Suppose that we have a simply supported beam upon which there is a load
w(x) which is acts on the beam by some arbitrary function of x, as shown in
Figure 8.5.1.

Ax                                     B

Figure 8.5.1 A simply supported beam with a distributed load that is a function
of beam position w(x).

    For a thin section of this beam between x and x + x, we can assume that
the distributed load is approximately constant and equal to w = w(x). With
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                                             312

this assumption, the distributed load is rectangular, and equivalent to a force
W = wx acting at the centroid of the rectangle. The free-body diagram for
this thin section is shown in Figure 8.5.2.

Figure 8.5.2 A free-body diagram of a small section of the beam with a width
of x.

    Applying the force equilibrium in the vertical direction gives the following
result:

                                                Fy = 0
                                       V + wx = (V + V )

                                              V = wx
                                              V

                                               x
Taking the limit of both sides as x approaches 0, we get this important result

 lim V                                    = lim (w)
x 0 x

                                 dx

    This differential equation tells us that at a given location x, the slope of the
shear function at that point is the value of the loading directly above, w(x).

    Furthermore, if we separate the variables by multiplying both sides by dx,
and then integrate between any two points along the beam we find that

                                       b

V = w(x) dx                                                            (8.5.2)

                                    a

In words, this equation says that the change in the shear V between any

two points a and b, is the area under the loading curve between them.

Next, considering moment equilibrium of the fbd in Figure 8.5.2, and follow-

ing the same procedure, we get:

M =0

                                 x x
(M + M ) = V + (V + V ) + M

Separating variables and taking limits as before, gives:

                           = V (x)

                      dx

    This equation tells us that at any point on the beam the slope of the moment
function is equal to the value of the shear at that point.

    Furthermore, if we multiply both sides by dx, we can integrate to find that

                                            b                (8.5.4)

                         M = V (x) dx

                                a

In words, this equation says that over a given segment, the change in the

moment value is the area under the shear curve.

Summary. The internal shear force V (x), bending moment M (x), and loading
w(x) at every point xare related to each other by the integral and differetial
equations below.

dV                           The slope of the shear function at x is the
     = w(x)              value of the loading function at the same posi-
                         tion. An upward load is considered a positive

                 b           The change in the shear value between two
                         points is the area under the loading function be-

Remark 8.5.3 Sign Conventions.

It is sometimes convenient to assume that positive loads act down, and not
up as we have assumed here. In that case simply subtitute -w(x) for w(x)
into and equations (8.5.1) and (8.5.2) and use these variations instead:

Thinking Deeper 8.5.4 What happens if we keep integrating?

As we have seen, integrating the load function once gives the shear force,
and integrating the shear force gives the bending moment.
You may be wondering what happens if we keep integrating? Does this
produce anything interesting?
In fact it does, as you will see in Mechanics of Materials. In the Statics
world, all beams are assumed to be rigid, but in the real world they deform
under load. The shape the beam takes on is described by a deflection curve
which gives the actual displacement of the beam at any given point due
to the applied loads
Integrating the bending moment M (x) (and dividing by the flexural rigid-
ity, EI) gives the slope of the deflection curve, which represents the angle
of the beam's deformation at any given point.
Integrating that function once more (and dividing by EI again) gives the
actual deflection function.
So, if you keep integrating the load function, you're essentially moving
through these stages of beam analysis, progressing from the applied forces
to the resulting deformation: Load ² Shear ² Moment ² Slope ² Deflec-
tion. Each step provides valuable information about the beam's behavior
under the given loading conditions.

8.6 Section Cut Method

In this section we'll extend the method of Section 8.3 where we found the internal
forces at a specific point to to find the internal forces at every point needed to
produce s shear and bending moment diagram.

    The procedure is identical except that the cut is taken at a position desig-
nated by x instead of at a specified point. The analysis produces equations as
functions of x rather than values at a particular x. Shear and bending moment
diagrams are plots of these equations, and the internal forces at any particular
point can be found by substituting that particular value of x into the equations.

    We will use a cantilevered beam fixed to a wall on the left end and subjected
to a vertical force P on the right end as an example. Global equilibrium requires
that the reactions at the fixed support at A are a vertical force Ay = P , and a
counter-clockwise moment MA = P L.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                      315

    By taking a cut at a distance x from the left we can draw two free-body dia-
grams with lengths x and (L - x). This beam has one loading segment, because
no matter where x is chosen, the free-body diagrams shown in Figure 8.6.1 (b)
and (c) are correct. The internal loadings are named V (x) and M (x) to indicate
that they are functions of x and are drawn with positive sense as defined in
Section 8.2.

(a) Left fbd.               (b) Right fbd.

Figure 8.6.1

    To find the shear and bending moment functions, we apply the equilibrium
to one of the free-body diagrams. Either side will work, so we'll select the right-
hand portion Figure 8.6.1(b) since it doesn't require us to find the reactions at
A. Letting L be the length of the beam and (L - x) the length of the right
portion, we find

                Fy = 0      Mcut = 0
               V (x) = P    M (x) = -P (L - x)

    The plots of the equations for V (x) and M (x) are shown below in Figure 8.6.2.
These equations indicate that the shear force V (x) is constant P over the length
of the beam and the moment M (x) is a linear function of the position of the cut,
x starting at -P L at x = 0 and linearly increasing to zero at x = L. Note that
the graphs are only valid from 0  x  L, so the curves outside this range are
shown as dotted lines. These two graphs are usually drawn stacked beneath the
load diagram of the beam.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES  316

Figure 8.6.2 Shear and Bending Moment Diagrams for Cantilever Beam
    The previous example was simple because only one fbd was necessary for any

point on the beam, but many beams are more complex. Beams with multiple
loads must be divided into loading segments between the points where loads are
applied or where distributed loads begin or end.

    Consider the simply supported beam AD with a uniformly distributed load
w over the first segment from A to B, and two vertical loads B and C .

Figure 8.6.3 Simply Suppported Beam with Uniformly Distributed Load
    This beam has three loading segments so you must draw three free-body

diagrams and analyze each segment independently. For each, make an imaginary
cut through the segment, then draw a new free-body diagram of the portion to
the left (or right) of the cut. Always assume that the exposed internal shear
force and internal bending moment act in the positive direction according to the
sign convention.

    After the equilibrium equations are applied to each segment, the resulting
equations V (x) and M (x) from each segment are joined to plot the shear and
moment diagrams. These diagrams help us visualize the values of V and M
throughout the beam.

Example 8.6.5 Section Cut Method.

Draw the shear and bending moment diagrams for the beam of Figure 8.6.3

   centroid of the the rectangular loading, and draw a free body dia-
   gram of the whole beam.

3. Draw a free-body diagram of the section of the beam between 0 <
   x < 4 m.
   The loading on this segment of the beam is w(x) = 15 N/m, acting
   down and constant. The equivalent force is the area of the rectangle
   W = 15x, which is a first degree function of x.

Note that this method does not give us shear and moment values at exactly
x = 4 m and x = 8 m. Discontinuities occur at these locations, and the
shear function has different values when approaching 4 and 8 from the left
and from the right!

8.7 Graphical Method

Once you have a firm grasp on the relations between load, shear and bending
moments, you can quickly draw shear and bending moment diagrams using a
graphical approach. This technique is really a graphical integration process;
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                                                  320

rather than using calculus, the integrals are found using simple geometry.

8.7.1 Relationship Review

Shear and bending moment diagrams are governed by equations (8.5.1) through
(8.5.4) and must be consistent with them.

        dV                  dM
             = w(x)               = V (x)

        V = w(x) dx         M = V (x) dx

                       a                     a

    From top to bottom, the shear function is determined from the area under
the load, and the moment function is determined from the area under the shear
function. At the same time, from bottom to top, differentiating the moment
function gives the shear function, and differentiating the shear function gives
the load.

    Shear and bending moment are piecewise functions made up of a series of
jumps, slopes and areas. Jumps are vertical changes in shear and moment dia-
grams caused by concentrated forces and moments. Slopes are gradual changes
in the functions. Areas are the `areas' under the loading and shear curves, i.e.
the integral. The area under the loading curve is actually a force, and the area
under the shear curve is actually a bending moment.

    The relationship between load, shear, and bending moment are summarized
below.

Jumps                                      Shear Diagram

Areas   The slope of the shear diagram at a point is equal to the value of the distributed

        Downward distributed loads create negative slopes on the shear diagram.

        the corresponding change in value of the shear.

        The slope of the moment diagram at a point is equal to the value of the
        shear at that point.

        The area under the shear curve between two points is equal to
        the corresponding change in the value of the moment.

    You can use the interactive below to explore how changes to concentrated
load P and distributed load w affect the slopes, jumps, and areas of the resulting
shear and bending moment diagrams.

8.7.2 Graphical Method Procedure

You can draw shear and bending moments efficiently and accurately using this
procedure

   1. First, determine the reaction forces and moments by drawing a free-body
       diagram of the entire beam and applying the equilibrium equations. Dou-
       ble check that your reactions are correct.

   2. Establish the shear graph with a horizontal axis below the beam and a
       vertical axis to represent shear. Positive shears will be plotted above the
       x axis and negative below.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES  322

3. Make vertical lines at all the "interesting points", i.e. points where concen-
   trated forces or moments act on the beam and at the beginning and end
   of any distributed loads. This divides the beam into segments between
   vertical lines.

4. Draw the shear diagram by starting with a dot at x = 0, V = 0 then
   proceeding from left to right until you reach the end of the beam. Choose
   and label a scale which keeps the diagram a reasonable size.

     (a) Whenever you encounter a concentrated force, jump up or down by
          that value

     (b) Whenever you encounter a concentrated moment, do not jump.

     (c) Whenever you encounter a distributed load, move up or down by
          the "area" under the loading curve over the length of the segment,
          according to equation (8.5.2). The "area" is actually a force.

     (d) The slope of the curve at each point x is given by (8.5.1). Distributed
          loads cause the shear diagram to have a slope equal to value of the
          distributed load at that point. For unloaded segments of the beam,
          the slope is zero, i.e. the shear curve is horizontal. For segments with
          uniformly distributed load, the slope is constant. Downward loads
          cause downward slopes.

     (e) The shear diagram should start and end at V = 0. If it doesn't,
          recheck your work.

5. Add another interesting point wherever the shear diagram crosses the x-
   axis, and determine the x position of the zero crossing.

6. After you have completed the shear diagram, calculate the area under the
   shear curve for each segment. Areas above the axis are positive, areas
   below the axis are negative. The areas represent moments and the sum of
   the areas plus the values of any concentrated moments should add to zero.
   If they don't, then recheck your work.

7. Establish the moment graph beneath the shear diagram with a horizontal
   axis below the shear diagram and a vertical axis to represent moment.
   Positive moments will be plotted above the x axis and negative below.

8. Draw and label dots on the moment diagram by starting with a dot at
   x = 0, M = 0 then proceed from left to right placing dots until you reach
   the end of the beam. As you move over each segment move up or down
   from the current value by the "area" under the shear curve for that segment
   and place a dot on the graph. In this step, you are applying (8.5.4).

     (a) Positive areas cause the moment to increase, negative areas cause it
          to decrease.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                                                                                                 323

     (b) If you encounter a concentrated moment, jump straight up or down
          by the amount of the moment and place a dot. Clockwise moments
          cause upward jumps and counter-clockwise moments cause downward
          jumps.

     (c) When you reach the end of the beam you should return to M = 0. If
          you don't, then recheck your work.

9. Connect the dots with correctly shaped lines. Segments under constant
   shear are straight lines, segments under changing shear are curves. The
   general curvature of the lines can be determined by considering equation
   (8.5.3).

Remark 8.7.4 Tips for Drawing Good Shear and Bending Moment Dia-
grams.

   1. Work neatly and professionally, and take pride in your work. Use a
       straightedge!

   2. Draw a labeled free-body diagram of the entire structure, and your
       work to find the reactions off to the side. For this free-body diagram,
       you may replace the distributed loads with equivalent concentrated
       loads.

   3. Next draw a careful sketch of the beam showing its reactions and
       the actual distributed loads. Distributed loads must be shown here,
       because their distributed nature is significant.

   4. Draw the shear diagram directly below the load diagram and the
       moment diagram beneath that. It is convenient to draw these graphs
       on graph paper. Indicate the scale used each function.

   5. Downward forces make the shear digram move down, counterclock-
       wise concentrated moments make the moment curve jump down.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                        325

6. Show the correct shape and curvature for each curve segment: zero,
   constant slope, polynomial. Changes in curve shapes should align
   with the load which causes them.

7. Indicate the values of shear and moment at maximums, minimums
   and points of inflection.

8. Include any other work needed to justify your results.

8.8 Integration Method

In Section 8.5 we saw that loading, shear and bending moments are related by
integral and differential equations, and in Subsection 8.7.2 used this knowledge
to draw shear and bending moment diagram using a graphical approach. This
method is straightforward and fast for concentrated forces and uniformly distrib-
uted loads, because they produce triangular and rectangular areas that are easy
to calculate but it falls short when the areas are more complicated.

    For example, a uniformly varying load is a first degree linear function of x,

                                            w(x) = w0x

It integrates to a second degree parabolic shear function, and a third degree
cubic moment function. Finding the zero crossings and areas under these curves
with geometery is troublesome. More complex loading functions are even more
difficult.

    When the loading becomes complex it is better to use the fundamental rela-
tions (8.5.2) and (8.5.4) to find the shear and bending moment functions directly

                 b                             b

V = w(x) dx                 M = V (x) dx

               a                             a

Rather than finding areas and slopes using geometry, we will directly integrate
the load function w(x) once to find the shear function v(x), then integrate that
result to find the moment function m(x).

    These results are the change in shear and moment over a segment; to find
the actual shear and moment functions V (x) and M (x) for the entire beam we
will need to find initial values for each segment. This is equivalent to applying
boundary conditions to find the constant of integration when solving a differen-
tial equation. The initial values come from either the final value of the previous
segment or from point loads or point moments. Because of the requirement for
these segment starting values, no segment can be computed in isolation from the
other segments. Physically this means that the shear and moment along a beam
are not just due to the loading in one segment, but are related to the loading on
the rest of the beam as well.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                         326

8.8.1 Determining Loading Functions

Before you can find shear and bending moment functions with integration you
must know the equation for the load on each segment of the beam. These
equations may be given in the problem statement if you're lucky, or you may
have to determine them from a loading diagram.

    When determining equations for loading segments, you may choose either
global equations, where all segments use the same origin, usually at the left end
of the beam, or local equations, where each segment uses its own origin, usually
at the left end of the segment. Often local equations are easier because you
can simply use the variable x in your equations as opposed to "x + constant",
and you do not have to project the y-intercept values back to an axis system
which is not adjacent to the segment. See interactive Figure 8.8.1 to explore the
difference between local and global equations.

    When determining equations for the loading segments from the load diagram,
consider the following.

· No load.

   Whenever there is no load at all on a segment there will be no change in
   the shear on the segment. On such sections the loading function is

                            w(x) = 0.

Note that this can only occur when the weight of the beam itself is ne-
glected.

· Point Load.

   A point load is a concentrated force acting at a single point which causes
   a jump in the shear diagram.

· Uniformly Distributed Load.

   A uniformly distributed load is constant over the segment and results in
   a linear slope, either a triangle or a trapezoid, on the shear diagram. The
   loading function on such sections is

w(x) = C V (x) = Cx + b.

The constant value is negative if the load points down, and positive if it
points upward.

· Uniformly Varying Load.

   In this case the loading function is a straight, sloping lie forming a trian-
   gle or trapezoidal shape. The resulting shear function is parabolic. The
   general form of these functions are

w(x) = mx + b               V (x) = mx2 + bx + c.
                                        2
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                         327

   The slope m, intercept b, and constant c must be determined from the
   situation, and will depend on whether you are writing a global or local
   equation.

· Arbitrary Load.
   The loading function will be a given function of x.

                                           w(x) = f (x),

   and the shear and moment functions are found by integration.

V (x) = f (x)dx M (x) = V (x)dx

       Most gravitational distributed loads are drawn with the arrows pointing
       down and resting on the beam. If you slide these along their line of action
       so that their tails are on the beam, the tips define the loading equation. In
       other words, for downward pointing loads, the scalar values are negative.

    This interactive compares the local and global equations for a beam segment
with a uniformly varying load.

CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES  328

8.8.2 Application of the Integration Method

You can either use this method from the start or use the graphical method until
you need areas of shapes more complicated than rectangles and triangles.

   1. You will need to have solved the loading segment to the left of your desired
       segment.

   2. Write an equation for the loading w in the segment using either local or
       global coordinates.

   3. Integrate the loading equation w(x) to find the change in the shear V and
       include the shear value at the beginning of your loading segment including
       the influence of any point loads at that location, which is equivalent to the
       integration constant.

   4. Integrate the shear equation V (x) to find the change in the bending mo-
       ment M and include the moment value at the beginning of your loading
       segment including the influence of any point couple-moments at that loca-
       tion, equivalent to the integration constant.

   5. To find maximum shear and bending moments, recall from calculus that
       the local maximum/minimum points of a function occur at the endpoints
       and where the function's first derivative is equal to zero.

         (a) For shear, evaluate the shear function V (x) at the ends and where
              ever the load function crosses the x axis.

        (b) For bending moments, find the roots of the shear function by solving
              V (x) = 0, then evaluate the moment function M (x) at these points,
              and also at the endpoints.

       The critical values we are looking for are the points where the magnitudes
       of the shear and bending moment are maximum. The direction of the
       internal forces is not usually significant.

    Example 8.8.2 Uniformly Distributed Load.

    Use the integration method to find the equations for shear and moment
    as a function of x, for a simply supported beam carrying a uniformly
    distributed load w over its entire length L.

                                                                                  w

                                                                       x
                                              L
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                             329

Solution.
This beam has only one load section, and on that section the load is
constant and points down, so,

                                       w(x) = -w.

There is a pinned connection at x = 0 which provides a vertical force and
no concentrated moment, so the initial conditions there are V (0) = wL/2,
and M (0) = 0.
Integrating equations (8.5.2) and (8.5.4) we have.

                                                                                 x

Example 8.8.3 Piecewise Function.

Consider a 20 m beam loaded as as shown. Use the integration method to
derive the shear and bending moment as functions of x and plot them.

Solution.

   1. Reactions.
       Find the reactions using the methods of Section 7.8.

                                    MA = 0
       -W1x1 + W2x2 + RB(20 m) = 0

                              RB(20 m) = 120 kN · 5 m - 45 kN · 13.33 m
                                       RB = 0

                                      Fy = 0
                RA - W1 + W2 + RB = 0

                                       RA = 120 kN - 45 kN
                                       RA = 75 kN

2. Segment 1.
   On the first half of the beam, for the range x = 0 up to and including
   x = 10 m, the loading is constant and pointing down, so the loading
   function on this segment is

                                  w1(x) = -12 kN/m.
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                               331

Integrating twice gives the shear and bending moment functions on
this segment

 V1(x) = -12x + C0
M1(x) = -6x2 + C0x + C1

Evaluating the boundary conditions, V (0) = RA and M (0) = 0 we
learn that

                                   C0 = 75 kN.
                                       C1 = 0

3. Segment 2.

   To simplify the analysis of the second half of the beams we will use
   local coordinates by defining

x = (x - 10).

In local coordinates, the function is valid over the range 0 < x <=
10.

The load over this segment starts at 9 kN/m but decreases to zero
after 10 m, so the slope is

m = -9 kN/m = - 9 kN/m2.
10 m                            10

In terms of x the load the loading function is

                               w2(x) = 9 - 9 x.
                                                 10

Integrating twice gives the shear and moment functions.

V2(x) = 9x - 9 x2 + C2
                   20

M2(x) = 9 x2 - 3 x3 + C2x + C3
2                           20

The constants are evaluated by matching the functions at the bound-
ary x = 10 m, where

 V1(10) = -45 kN
M1(10) = 150 kN·m

Evaluating V2(x) and M2(x) at x = 0 we find that

C2 = -45 kN
C3 = 150 kN·m
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES                              332

4. Results.
   Combining results we get the final version of shear and bending
   moment functions in terms of x.
   On the range 0 < x <= 10

                                   V (x) = -12x + 75
                                  M (x) = -6x2 + 75x

On the range 10 < x <= 20

V (x) = - 9 (x - 10)2 + 9(x - 10) - 45
             20

M (x) = - 3 (x - 10)3 + 9 (x - 10)2 - 45(10 - x) + 150
20                          2

A plot of the two functions is shown below. Notice how the two halves of
each function joins continuously at x = 10 m.

ment diagrams. You can change the position of the loads and change their mag-
nitudes and observe how the diagrams change, or you can click New Problem to
generate a new problem.

8.10 Summary

You have likely realized that in engineering (and life) that there are multiple
ways to solve a problem. The four different techniques to compute internal
forces discussed in this chapter are a demonstration of this. In the end, the
choice of which method to use is yours; the better you know each method the
easier it will be to choose the one which is most applicable and efficient.

    The list below summarizes each of the four approaches and their advantages
and disadvantages.

    List 8.10.1 Summary of Methods to find Internal Loadings.

       · In Section 8.3 we exposed the internal forces at a specific point inside
           a rigid body by taking a cut at that location and applying the equi-
           librium equations. This approach is computationally efficient, works
           for any rigid body and takes advantage of tools you have learned in
           previous chapters. It requires knowledge of sign conventions for in-
           ternal shear and bending moments, but only reveals values at the
           selected point.

       · In Section 8.6 we generalized the previous approach by taking a cut
           at a variable location, and analyzed the equilibrium equations in
           terms of x. The results were functions which describe shear and
           moment at every point within the beam, rather than at a specific lo-
           cation. This method requires breaking a beam into loading segments
           and writing and solving equations for each segment. The equations
           are then plotted to give shear and bending moment diagrams.

       · In Section 8.7 we used the mathematical relationships between load-
           ing, shear, and bending moment to draw shear and moment diagrams
           directly. The method is quick and requires only a few simple compu-
           tations to determine the critical values. The approach provides many
           cross-checks for accuracy. It is most suitable for beams loaded with
           concentrated forces, concentrated moments, and uniformly distrib-
           uted loads, but is not usually suitable for more complex distributed
           loads. It is essential to have a solid grasp of the integral and dif-
           ferential relations between loading, shear and moment discussed in
           Section 8.5 to use this method.

       · In Section 8.8 we discussed the most general approach to determine
           internal loads. In the approach, the load is described as a piece-
CHAPTER 8. INTERNAL FORCES  342

wise function of x, which is integrated twice to develop equations

cated loading distributions, and can be used by software solutions.
Applying this method by hand requires accurate integration and dif-
ferentiation, and application of boundary conditions.

Friction

Friction is the force which resists relative motion between surfaces in contact
with each other.

    Friction is categorized by the nature of the surfaces in contact and the con-
ditions under which they are interacting. There are many different types of
friction, some of which are listed below.

   1. Dry friction, which is the force that opposes one solid surface sliding
       across another solid surface.

   2. Rolling friction is the force that opposes motion of a rolling wheel or
       ball.

   3. Fluid friction is the friction between layers of a viscous fluid in motion.
   4. Skin friction, also called drag, is the friction that occurs between a fluid

       and a moving surface.
   5. Internal friction is the force resisting the internal deformation of a solid

       material.
    An understanding of friction is important factor in the design, functionality
and performance of many mechanical systems. In this text we will only consider
dry friction out of the many types of friction listed above. So far, we have only
looked at situations where friction could be safely ignored; however, there are
many cases where the effect of dry friction is significant. These include slipping
or tipping, blocks, wedges, screws, belts, bearings, and rotating discs. These are
the subject of this chapter.

9.1 Dry Friction

    Key Questions

       · Which types of friction do we study in statics, and which are studied
           elsewhere?

       · What is a normal force?

       · What is impending motion?

       · How do you decide when you can use the equation F = µsN and
           when you can not?

       · Can you show graphically how friction and normal force vectors are
           related to the friction resultant vector and the friction angle at im-
           pending motion?

       · What is the friction angle s?

       · Why is a distributed normal force represented as a point force that
           moves as the normal force shifts?

Dry Friction. Dry friction, also called Coulomb friction, is a force which
appears between two solid surfaces in contact. This force is distributed over
the contact area and always acts in whichever direction opposes relative motion
between the surfaces. We will usually simplify the distributed frictional force
by representing it as a single concentrated force acting at a point, as we did in
Section 7.8.

    Depending on the details of the situation, dry friction will either hold the
object in equilibrium, in which case it is called static friction, or it will retard
but not prevent motion, in which case it is called kinetic friction.

    Consider the football training sled shown in Figure 9.1.1. Initially, the sled's
weight is supported by a normal force acting on the bottom surface that can be
considered as a point force directly beneath the center of gravity; there is no
friction force.

    When players begin to push the sled, a friction force will appear along the
bottom surface which opposes sliding to the right. Both the friction and normal
forces can be represented by concentrated horizontal and vertical forces located
to the right of the center of gravity. This offset is required to maintain rotational
equilibrium against the pushing force. If the players push hard enough, equilib-
rium will break and the sled will begin to slide in the direction of the push. At
this point static friction has transitioned to kinetic friction.

Figure 9.1.1 Static friction holds an object stationary, up to the point of im-
pending motion. Kinetic friction applies to sliding objects.

    The rolling friction acting on the motorcycle in Figure 9.1.2 is more compli-
cated. Both wheels rotate clockwise, but the rear wheel is driven by the engine
and chain, while the front wheel is rotated by the road friction. The friction
force on the rear tire acts to the right and is what propels the bike forward.
The dry friction on the front tire acts to the left and retards the motion of the
motorcycle.

Thinking Deeper 9.1.3 Statically Equivalent Loadings.

The force distribution on the bottom of an object being pushed across a
surface is complex, and looks approximately like (a).
To simplify things, we first decompose the actual force into a distributed
normal force perpendicular to the surface, and a distributed friction force
parallel to the surface, as shown in the (b). These two distributions are
further simplified into two concentrated forces representing the normal
and friction components of a single resultant force, as show in (c). The
net resultant force acts at the point required for equilibrium.

9.1.1 Coulomb Friction

The Coulomb friction model proposes that the force of friction is proportional
to the normal force, where the normal force is the force acting perpendicular to
the contacting surface.

                                             Ff = µN

The constant of proportionality, µ, is called the friction coefficient. µ is always
greater than zero and commonly less than one. The friction coefficient can be
greater than one for materials that exhibit positive adhesion to each other like
silicone rubber, glued surfaces, or gecko's feet.

Figure 9.1.5

    Friction has two distinct regions as shown in Figure 9.1.6, and the value of
µ is different in each region. The region from point one to point two, where the
force of friction increases linearly with load is called the static friction region.
Here you must use the coefficient of static frictionµs. The region from point
two to point three, where the friction remains roughly constant is called the
kinetic friction region. In this region you must use the coefficient of kinetic
frictionµk.

Figure 9.1.6 Phases of Coulomb friction.

    The coefficient of friction suddenly drops at point two, causing the friction
force Ff to drop as well. Point two is called the point of impending motion,
because here the situation is unstable. If the applied force increases ever so
slightly, the opposing friction force suddenly decreases and the object begins to
move.

    To better understand the behavior of Coulomb friction imagine an object
resting on a rough surface as shown in Figure 9.1.5(b). When force P is gradually
increased from zero, the normal force N and the frictional force Ff both change in
response. Initially both P and Ff are zero and the object is in equilibrium. The
interaction between the two surfaces in contact means that friction is available
but it is not engaged Ff = P = 0.

    As P increases, the opposing friction force Ff increases as well to match and
hold the object in equilibrium. In this static-but-not-impending phase Ff = P .

    When P reaches point two, motion is impending because friction has reached
its maximum value. Ffmax = µsN = P . If force P increases slightly beyond Ffmax,
the friction force suddenly drops to the kinetic value Ff = µkN . The applied
force exceeds the frictional force breaking equilibrium and causing the object to
accelerate, and accelerating bodies are beyond the scope of Statics!

    Notice that static friction at impending motion is greater than kinetic friction,
because the coefficient µs > µk for most materials. Practically, this tells us that
once a material starts to move it is easier to keep moving than it was to get it
started from rest.

    If you wonder why we include kinetic friction in a statics course, remember
that a sliding body moving at constant velocity is in equilibrium.

9.1.2 Friction Angle and Friction Resultant

Recall that a resultants is the sum of two or more vectors. The friction resul-
tant is the vector sum of the friction and normal forces. Since these two forces
are perpendicular, the magnitude of the friction resultant can be found using
the Pythagorean theorem.

                     R = F 2f + N 2                  (9.1.1)
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                                          350

The friction angles is defined as the angle between the friction resultant

and the normal force. At impending motion, the friction angle reaches its maxi-

mum value. The friction resultant and friction angle are used for screw, flexible

belt, and journal bearing type problems.

The maximum friction angle s is directly related to the coefficient of static

friction µs since the friction angle s is the internal angle of the right triangle

formed by the normal force N , the friction resultant R, and the friction force F .

Hence:           tan s = F        s = tan-1 F

                                                         (9.1.2)

    In Figure 9.1.7 a block of weight W is pushed sideways by force P . The
reaction forces can be represented as separate friction and normal forces, or as
combined friction force R acting at friction angle s, measured from the normal
direction.

9.1.3 Normal Forces

The normal force supporting the object is distributed over the entire contact
surface, however it is common on two dimensional problems to replace the dis-
tributed force with an equivalent concentrated force acting at a particular spot
on the contacting surface, as we did in Chapter 7. This point is rarely at the
exact center of the contact surface.

    This is illustrated in Figure 9.1.8 where we see in that an object at rest has
a uniformly distributed normal force along the bottom surface and the resultant
normal force is located directly below the weight. The friction force is not
engaged. When a pushing force Fpush is applied, the distributed normal force
changes shape, and the resultant normal force N shifts to the right to maintain
equilibrium. The resultant normal force continues to shift to the right the harder
you push.

    This can be understood from the principle of a two-force body. As we dis-
cussed previously, the combined push and weight can be represented a single
load acting down and to the right. The friction and normal forces can be com-
bined into a single reaction force acting up and to the left at a point on the
bottom surface. These two forces must share the same line of action to maintain
equilibrium, so as the pushing force increases, the friction angle changes and
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION  351

the point shifts to the right. If the point shifts off the physical object then the
required friction is greater than the friction available and motion begins.

9.1.4 Coulomb Friction Examples.

Static, but not impending motion. For these problems Ff is independent
of N so you will need one additional piece of data in order to solve for both Ff
and N since you will not be able to apply the equation Ff = µsN . The problem
statement will use words like `sitting', `static' or `at rest', but no extremal lan-
guage like `maximum'. The reaction can be modeled as a pin reaction, and then
possibly checked to confirm F < µsN .

   A moment of 20 N · m is applied to a wheel held static by a brake arm.
   What is the friction force between the wheel and the brake arm?

What is the lightest box which will not slip or tip on this slope?

Kinetic friction. In these problems, Ff = µkN . The problem statement will
say that the body is moving at a constant velocity.

   A 40 kg box is sliding down a 20° slope, what is the coefficient of friction
   to keep the velocity constant?

   A rope slips over a surface at constant velocity, what is the contact angle
   of the rope?

9.2 Slipping vs. Tipping

   Key Questions

       · What are the possible motions which can occur when you apply a
           force to an object sitting on a rough surface?

       · How do you determine which motion will occur in a particular situ-
           ation?

       · Which types of motion are beyond the scope of Statics?

    This section focuses on the various ways a rigid body in equilibrium might
begin to move. The point at which an object starts to move is called the point
of impending motion.

    The interactive in Figure 9.2.1 shows a box sitting on a rough surface. Imag-
ine that we start pushing on the side of the box with a gradually increasing
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                                         353

force. Initially, friction between the block and the incline will increase to main-
tain equilibrium, and the box will sit still.

    As we continue to increase the force there are two possibilities; the maximum
static friction force will be reached and the box will begin to slide, or the pushing
force and the friction force will create a sufficient couple to cause the box tip on
its corner.

Live Link

Figure 9.2.1 Slipping vs. Tipping

    The easiest way to determine whether the box will slip, tip, or stay put is to
solve for the maximum load force P twice, once assuming slipping and a second
time expecting tipping, then compare the actual load to these maximums. This
process is summarized in the following three steps:

1. Check slipping.                                                       W
                                                            P
          As in all dry friction problems, the maximum
      friction force is equal to the static coefficient of    hd
      friction times the normal force

                            Ff max = µsN .

          Assume that the maximum normal force N is                         ?
      acting at an unknown location and solve for the                          N
      applied force which will maintain equilibrium. If
      the load exceeds this value than this the body        Figure 9.2.2 fbd
      will slip or maybe tip.                               to check slipping.

2. Check tipping.
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                            354

    The object will tip when the resultant               W
normal force N shifts off the end of the ob-
ject, because it no longer acts on the object      P        d
so it can't contribute to equilibrium.

which will maintain equilibrium. Any greater       Figure 9.2.3 fbd

ready slipping.

    At tipping, the friction force is static-but-
not-impending as it has not reached impend-
ing motion for slipping.

3. Compare the results.

If P exceeds the smaller of the limiting values, it will initiate the corre-
sponding impending motion.

Thinking Deeper 9.2.4 Failure in Engineering.

The goal of engineering design is to forecast and plan for all the ways that
something can fail. The challenge is to know the questions to ask and the
data to gather to model all possible failure modes. The controlling failure
is the mode which occurs at the smallest load.

9.3 Wedges

   Key Questions

       · Why is the normal force always perpendicular to the contact surface
           while the friction force always lies parallel to it?

       · Can you demonstrate graphically that components of friction and
           normal forces are related to the right-triangle trigonometry terms
           sine and cosine?

    A wedge is a tapered object which converts a small input force into a large
output force using the principle of an inclined plane. Wedges are used to separate,
split or cut objects, lift weights, or fix objects in place. The mechanical advantage
of a wedge is determined by the angle of its taper; narrow tapers have a larger
mechanical advantage.

    Wedges are used in two primary ways:
    Low friction wedges are a simple machines which allows users to create large
output forces to move objects using comparatively small input forces. In the log
splitter in Figure 9.3.1(a), hydraulic ram pushes a log into a stationary wedge.
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                  355

The normal force pushes the two halves of the log apart while the friction force
Ff is opposes the pushing force P .

    High-friction (self-locking) wedges control the location of objects or hold them
in place. Examples include doorstop wedges and carpentry wedges. The sailor
in Figure 9.3.1(b) is hammering two wooden wedges towards each other to cre-
ate large compressive forces to secure shoring timbers during a damage control
operation.

(a) A low friction wedge is used to  (b) High friction wedges are used to
split logs.                          secure shoring timbers.

Figure 9.3.1 Wedges in use.

    Luckily the analysis of low- and high-friction wedges are identical and they
are quite similar to the multi-force body equilibrium problems we saw in Chap-
ter 5 and Chapter 6. The main difference is the inclusion of friction from all
non-smooth contact surfaces. The directions of both the normal and friction
forces on the free-body diagrams are defined below.

    Normal forces act between bodies act perpendicular to the contacting sur-
faces. All normal forces on a free-body diagram should be pointing towards the
body because wedges are always subjected to compression.

    Friction forces are between bodies which act parallel or tangential to the
contacting surfaces and are created by the microscopic or large scale roughness
of the surfaces. All friction forces on a free-body diagram should be drawn
pointing in the direction which resists relative motion at the point of contact.

    The key added challenge of solving wedge problems is that the angled faces
of wedges usually need to be resolved into components in the x and y, unless a
different coordinate system is used.

    One of the critical steps in solving block or wedge problems is to determine
which force is engaging the friction of the system. Start by drawing the friction
forces on the body where this force acts. As you pass the friction and normal
forces to adjacent free-body diagrams, you must always show them as equal and
opposite, action-reaction pairs. This is illustrated in the following example.
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                                                                              356

the wedge is massless.

Solution. Given: W = 10 lb, µs = 0.2, and  = 25.
Start by assuming the wedge is on the verge of moving to the right and

By considering equilibrium of the combined wedge and block in the y
direction, we find that

                                    N1 = W = 10 lb

Assuming that the wedge is pushed to point of impending motion,

                              F1 = N1µs = 2 lb.

There are still two unused equilibrium equations for this free-body diagram,
but they are not sufficient to find unknown forces P and R because the
point where resultant friction force acts is also unknown.
Next, consider equilibrium of the block, Figure 9.3.3(b). A detail of N2
and F2 in Figure 9.3.4 shows how the their x and y components are related
to the wedge angle .

                              Fy = 0

             -W + N2y - F2y = 0
-W + N2 cos  - µsN2 sin  = 0

          N2(cos  - µs sin ) = W
                               N2 = 12.17 lb

                                                  Figure 9.3.4

Since the wedge is at the point of impending motion,

                     F2 = µsN2
                        = 2.43 lb

With the friction and normal forces on both sides of the wedge known,
we can now find the required force P using the free body diagram of the
wedge 9.3.3(c).

                    Fx = 0
P - F1 - F2x - N2x = 0

                       P = F1 + F2 cos  + N2 sin 
                       P = 9.35 lb

Example 9.3.5

Using the same system as in Example 9.3.2, find the minimum force P  to
prevent the wedge from slipping out from under the block
This is similar to the previous example, but the free-body diagrams need
to change in the following ways:

   · all friction force directions reverse since the impending motions of
       the block and wedge have reversed, and

   · the direction of P may have to reverse if the wedge has sufficient
       friction to stay static when P  = 0.

Note that for forces between P and P , the system is static and the friction
forces are static-but-not-impending.

Solution. This problem still requires a free-body diagram for each block
and wedge. The only difference between it and the previous example is
that the impending motion for the wedge is now to the left. Thus, the
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION  358

friction forces on the top and bottom of the wedge are to the right and
are both still at impending motion.
The remainder of the solution is left as an exercise for the reader.

9.4 Screw Threads

   Key Questions

       · Can you describe how the right-hand rule relates to the motion and
           rotation of screws?

       · What is the thread pitch and friction angle for a screw?

       · Contrast the different types of screw motion, with and against ap-
           plied loads, and match the motion cases to their corresponding equa-
           tion.

       · Why does a screw and a nut move in relatively opposite directions?

    A screw thread is uniform shape which spirals around the inside or outside
surface of a cylinder or cone. Like wedges, screws are simple machines. They are
essentially a ramp or inclined plane wrapped into a helix, and the input to screws
is torque rather than linear force. The mechanical advantage of a screw depends
on its lead, which is the linear distance the screw travels in one revolution.

    Screws used to fix objects in place are called fasteners, and screws used to
move objects are called power screws or lead screws. In this chapter we will
focus on power screws.

    A power screw assembly includes a nut with matching internal threads which
fits around the screw. There are two ways that a power screw can operate based
on the movement of the screw and nut. In a scissors jack, the operator rotates the
threaded rod with a crank fitted to the nut on the right, which is not threaded
but acts as a thrust bearing. The nut on the left moves along the stationary
screw to raise the load. In the C-clamp, the nut is stationary and the screw
translates through as it rotates. In either case, a small moment on the screw
can cause enormous forces on the nut, with the added benefit of the force being
applied at a precise location as controlled by the screw.

9.4.1 Screw Motion and the Right-hand rule

Most screw threads are right-hand threaded, which means they follow a right-
hand rule as illustrated in Figure 9.4.2. When you use your right hand to then
turn a right-handed thread towards your fingertips, it will move in the direction
of your thumb. When you are look at the head of a bolt and rotate it clockwise,
it tightens i.e.righty-tighty. The reverse, lefty-loosy, is also true.

(a) Loosening                     (b) Tightening

Figure 9.4.2 Right Hand Threads

    Left-handed screws are less common but are found in some applications,
especially:

· machines where reverse-threading prevents them from loosening gradually
   under the torque of the moving part. For example, the left pedal on a
   bicycle.
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                     360

   · machines where the movement of the screw creates dual motion, like a
       hand-screw wood clamp.

   · situations where you do not want to mix up constituents. Cutting torches
       use right-hand thread for the oxygen and left-hand threads for the acety-
       lene connections.

    The motion of left-handed screws can either be thought of as opposite the
right-hand rule or conforming to the same relationships if you use your left
hand. Notice that right-handed threads slope up to the right, while left-handed
threads slope down. Note that turning a thread upside-down does not reverse
its handedness.

9.4.2 Screw Thread Properties

Although most thread profiles are V-shaped, we only consider square threads in
this book. General purpose thread profiles, like NPT and ISO metric are more
difficult to analyze.

    The easiest way to analyze a square-thread power screw system is to turn the
problem into a two-dimensional problem by `unwrapping' the ramp from around
the cylinder of the shaft. The significant geometrical properties of the thread
are

   · The mean radius, r.

   · The lead, l, also called the pitch.

   · The lead angle, , also called the helix angle.

T o visualize these terms, imagine unwrapping a thread from around the screw,
as shown in Figure 9.4.4.

Figure 9.4.4 Thread properties

    The mean radius is the distance from the centerline to a point halfway be-
tween the tip and the root of the thread. Twice this value is the effective diam-
eter.

    The lead is the linear travel the nut makes in one revolution, which is also the
distance from a point on the screw thread to a corresponding point on the same
thread after one rotation. Threads are commonly designated by the number of
threads per-inch or per-centimeter, and pitch is the inverse of this value.

    The lead angle is related to the pitch and the mean radius by trigonometry.
Using the right triangle shown in Figure 9.4.4(b), the thread lead angle  is the
inverse tangent of the ratio of the lead over the circumference

                      = tan-1 l
                                     2r

9.4.3 Moment to Reach Impending Motion

The focus of this section is to find the magnitude of a moment which will push
a screw to impending motion. Impending motion is the threshold between the
system holding still and moving, so knowledge of the moment required at im-
pending motion allows you to interpret what happens to the screw system in
static but not impending-motion conditions as well.

    Assuming that motion is impending means that we can use the coefficient
of static friction µs and the related friction angle s. Recall from earlier in this
chapter, that the friction angle s is related directly to µs the by the equation:

                                        s = tan-1 F
                                                         N

    We now have the tools assembled to derive the relationship between a screw's
geometry and the applied loads.

Applied Force Opposes Impending Motion

In this scenario we will examine the magnitude of moment M required to raise
a screw to impending motion against the applied force W as shown in Fig-
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION           362

ure 9.4.5(a). To eliminate any references to the orientation of the screw and
force like up, down, left, or right, this type of motion will be described as "the
applied force opposes impending motion." This case occurs any time you are
applying a force to an object with a screw.

    The free-body diagram in Figure 9.4.5(b) shows the moment M required to
raise a load W and the friction and normal forces acting on a slice of thread.
These must be summed over the entire length of the thread to find the total
friction and normal forces.

                                                                             W

                                                                                      M

(a) Screw Jack       (b) fbd

Figure 9.4.5 A screw jack supports a load which opposes impending motion.

    It is often easiest to express the friction force F and normal force N as the
friction resultant R and the friction angle s. Recall that the friction force F
direction always opposes the impending motion of the point of contact -- in this
case, the screw threads. Also, the thread angle  determines the angle of the
normal force N from the centerline of the screw. Finally, the friction angle s is
the angle between the friction resultant force R and the normal force N .

    Figure 9.4.6 is a free-body diagram of single thread element. Wi is the fraction
of the total weight on this element, and the total moment M is represented by
the fraction of the rotational force Pi acting at the mean radius r from the center
of the screw

                                            Pi = M /r.
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                              363

Figure 9.4.6 fbd of Thread Element

    Summing the forces in the x and y directions for the free-body diagram in
Figure 9.4.6 yields:

Fx = 0               Fy = 0
Pi = R sin( + s)     Wi = R cos( + s)

By summing the forces across all elements of one wrap of the screw we find:

Fx = 0               Fy = 0

M = R sin( + s)      W = R cos( + s)
r

    We next need to reduce these two equations to a single equation and also
eliminate the difficulty to quantify R term. Thus we solve both equations for
R.

                                                 M
                                  R = r sin( + s)

                                                W
                                  R = cos( + s)

Then, set them equal to each other and solve for the moment M .

                     M = W r tan(s + )                           (9.4.1)

    M is the moment required to raise the screw to impending motion, W is the
force load on the screw, r is the mean radius of the screw, s is the screw friction
angle, and  is the screw thread pitch.

    Practically, this equation says that the moment to move a screw against
an applied force must overcome the screw friction, represented by s, and the
component of the load on the screw, represented by .
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                    364

Applied Force Supports Impending Motion

When the impending motion of the screw is in the direction of the applied force,
we can also state that the "applied force supports impending motion." This
case occurs any time you remove a force held by a screw, like lowering the load
supported by the screw jack in Figure 9.4.5(a).

    This situation is a bit more complicated than the previous one, because
there are three different possibilities depending on the relative magnitude of the
friction angle s and the thread angle . Cases include

   1. Self-locking. s > .
       In this case the load will not cause the screw to rotate by itself,

   2. Unwind-with-load.s < .
       In this case, the load will move the screw without assistance, and

   3. Impending motion. s = .
       This case is the boundary between the two other cases.

In all three cases the thread angle  is the angle between the normal force N
and the centerline of the screw, and the friction angle s is the angle between
the friction resultant force R and the normal force N .

    The derivations of the relationships are quite similar to the derivation of
(9.4.1), but use subtly different free-body diagrams for each of the three cases.
See Figure 9.4.7 below.

Figure 9.4.7 Three possible situations when the load acts in the direction of
impending motion.

Self-locking screw. Self-locking screws are the type of screws that you will
encounter most often in mechanical systems as they are highly predictable. They
have sufficient friction available to hold their applied load even with no moment
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                      365

applied. Thus, they can safely carry a load in a static-but-not impending condi-
tion until you wish to overcome the excess friction by applying a moment M  to
push them to impending motion.

    Summing the forces in the x and y directions for the free-body diagram in
Figure 9.4.7(a) yields:

                     M  = W r tan(s - )  (9.4.2)

    Unwind-with-load screw As its name implies, an unwind-under-load screw
will start turning unless a moment M  is applied to keep the screw at or beyond
impending motion. The moment to push a self-locking screw to impending mo-
tion M  is in the opposite direction as the moment to keep unwind-under-load
screws at impending motion M , as M  is in the same direction as the moment
to loosen (or raise) a screw. These unwind-with-load screws are not often found
in mechanical systems, except for in dynamic motion control systems, where the
screw is used to slow down motion.

    To be designed in an unwind-with-load condition, a screw must have a quite
steep thread angle  and minimal friction between the threads and nut, which
reduces s.

    Summing the forces in the x and y directions for the free-body diagram in
Figure 9.4.7(c) yields:

                     M  = W r tan( - s)  (9.4.3)

    Impending-motion screw As the derived equations for all three unwind-
with-load screw cases push the screw towards impending motion, when a screw
is already at impending motion, it requires no applied moment to maintain
equilibrium; however, this case is mechanically unstable. If the load increases
slightly the screw will begin to unwind-under-load, whereas if the load decreases
slightly the screw will become self-locking.

    Summing the forces in the x and y directions for the free-body diagram in
Figure 9.4.7(b) yields:

                     M  = 0 when s =     (9.4.4)

    The concept of an applied force in the direction of impending motion works
equally well for either a force applied in the impending motion direction of a
screw, or for a force applied to the impending motion direction of a nut. An
example of the first case is the screw jack lowering a load, and the second could be
a scissors jack that has a rotating but non-translating screw, plus a non-rotating
but translating nut.

9.5 Flexible Belts

Key Questions

   · How does the impending motion of the system determine which side
       of the belt will have a larger tension?

   · How do you compute the contact angle  between the belt and pulley
       or cylinder?

   · How do you compute the tension differential on either side of the
       belt or cylinder for both flat and v-belts?

   · What determines the maximum torque transfer available from a pul-
       ley system?

    When a belt, rope, or cable is wrapped around an object, there is potential
for flexible belt friction. In Figure 9.5.1(a) friction allows the sailors to control
the speed that the mooring line pays out. The friction between the line and
the bollard depends on the number of turns the line takes around the bollard
post. In Figure 9.5.1(b) friction forces prevent the belt from slipping allow it to
transfer power from the motor to the drive pulley.

9.5.1 Frictionless Belts

Imagine with a flat, massless cable or belt passing over a frictionless cylinder or
pulley, in equilibrium. (Figure 9.5.2). A non-uniform distributed normal force
acts at points of contact with the cylinder to oppose the tension in the belt and
maintain equilibrium. The normal force varies as a function of the angle between
the contact surface and the direction the belt tension.

Figure 9.5.2 Free-body diagrams, equal tension.

    Without friction, the two tensions must be equal otherwise the belt would
slip around the cylinder. The only interaction force between the belt and pulley
is the distributed normal force. Due to the symmetry of this example, the x
components of the distributed force all cancel and the resultant is purely vertical.
In other situations this will not be true.

9.5.2 Friction in Flat Belts

When friction is available to oppose the sliding, the tensions in the two sides of
the belt will not be equal and friction will cause the pulley to rotate. Alternately
if the pulley is driven by an external moment, friction will cause one tension to
increase and the other to decrease. This, of course, is the point of a belt and
pulley system -- power transmission from the belt to the pulley or vice-versa.

    Figure 9.5.3(a) shows a free-body diagram of a belt and pulley in equilibrium.
The net moment caused by the two belts and the applied moment M are in
balance. The system may be stationary, or it may be rotating at a constant
velocity; however, it is impossible to tell from this diagram which direction.

    Figure 9.5.3(b) shows a free-body diagram of the belt. Since T+ is greater
than T-, in the absence of friction, the left side will move up, and the right side
will move down, as indicated by the arrows which indicate the relative motion
of belt with respect to the pulley. A distributed friction force Fbelt between
the belt and pulley which opposes the relative motion and maintains rotational
equilibrium. A distributed normal force also exists to maintain equilibrium in
the y direction.

    Figure 9.5.3(c) shows a free-body diagram of the pulley. The frictional and
normal forces acting on the pulley are equal and opposite to those acting on the
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                      368

belt. The arrow indicates that the impending relative motion of the pulley with
respect to the belt is counter-clockwise. The actual direction of rotation is not
known or indicated. Friction always acts opposite to the direction of relative
motion.

Pulley

Figure 9.5.3 Unequal Tensions

    Increasing M or the belt tension ratio T+/T- will increase the power trans-
mitted until the belt starts to slip. This occurs when the friction increases to

the maximum available value Fmax = µsM . At this point, motion (slipping) is
impending.

    We are interested in determining the range of values for the tension forces

where the belt does not slip relative to the surface. For a flat belt, the maximum

value for T+ depends on the magnitude of T-, the static coefficient of friction
between the belt and the surface µs, and the contact angle  between the belt
and the surface.

Contact Angle 

You will need to use the geometry of the pulleys to find the contact angle  be-
tween the belt and pulley. The belt will depart the pulley at a point of tangency,
which is always perpendicular to a radius. To find  create one or more right
triangles using the incoming and outgoing belt paths and apply complementary
angles to relate the belt geometry to the contact angle. There is no simple rule
for transferring cable angles over to the contact angle, but in general, extend
radial lines from the center of the pulley out to the belt's tangential lines. Next,
create right triangles with each radial line and work to find all the angles which
add up to the contact angle .
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION  369

Figure 9.5.4 Relationship between pulley geometry and contact angle .

Belt Tension

We have seen that when there is friction between a belt and a pulley, the tensions
on either end of the belt are not the same. In previous problems, we simply
guessed a direction for an unknown force, and then used the sign of the numerical
answer to confirm or reverse our assumption. Unfortunately, this does not work
for flexible belts, where we must make the correct determination before starting
computations. So, how can we determine which side has the larger tension, and
which side is smaller?

    The following discussion guides you through two methods to make this deci-
sion. Figure 9.5.5 shows a pulley and belt system and the associated free body
diagrams. The pulley is driven by a motor which supplies a counterclockwise mo-
ment of M . The belt is fixed, and holds the pulley in equilibrium until slipping
occurs. Both the pulley and belt are assumed massless.

    The grey arrows indicate the direction of impending motion. This is the
motion which will occur if the belt slips. For the belt, which is fixed, this
impending motion is relative to the pulley. For the pulley, motion is impending
relative to the belt, but since it can actually rotate it also has absolute impending
motion with respect to the earth.

Figure 9.5.5 Motor drive pulley with a fixed belt.

1. Method 1: Draw free-body diagrams and sum tensions along the cable.

   Friction always opposes impending relative motion at the point of contact,
   so if you can determine the direction the belt will potentially slip, you also
   know the direction of the friction force. You can find out which tension
   is larger and which is smaller by drawing a free-body diagram of the belt
   and summing forces along it.

   The free-body diagram Figure 9.5.5(b) shows the forces acting on the pul-
   ley, which are:

· Reaction force Ay from the fixed center axle.

· A distributed normal force N acting radially along the contact sur-
   face with the belt. 1

· A distributed friction force F acting along the contact surface, op-
   posing moment M and the impending motion of the pulley.

The free-body diagram Figure 9.5.5(c) shows the forces acting on the belt,
which are:

          · The belt's internal tension forces, labeled T1 and T2 since at this point
              we don't know their relative magnitudes.

          · A distributed normal force N acting radially along the contact sur-
              face between the pulley and belt. These are the distributed normal
              forces on the pulley transferred equal-and-opposite to the belt.

          · A distributed friction force F acting along the surface of the belt,
              again equal-and-opposite to the corresponding forces on the pulley.
              Since the belt is not actually moving these forces oppose the belt's
              relative impending motion with respect to the pulley.

    1The distributed normal forces is not symmetrical as drawn, but actually biased towards
the right, in order to have the net leftward force required to oppose the net friction acting to
the right. Fortunately, the actual shape is not significant to us.
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION  371

   Summing forces along the belt, we find that the tension T1 plus the dis-
   tributed friction force F must equal T2 for equilibrium.

                                             Fbelt = 0
                                   T1 + F - T2 = 0

                                                 T2 = T1 + F

   Therefore, the larger tension T+ = T2 and the smaller tension T- = T1.

2. Method 2: Larger tension acts in the direction of the impending motion
   of the belt.

   Following the logic of Method 1, it turns out that the larger tension always
   points in the direction of impending motion of the belt. It does not matter
   if the impending motion is relative as here with a fixed belt, or absolute
   as when the belt moves around a fixed object.

   There are multiple ways to determine the smaller and larger tensions in
   a flexible belt system. You can use the interactive below to develop your
   intuition on the relationship between belt tension, pulley moment, friction
   and relative motion.

Change in Belt Tension due to Friction
Applying the equilibrium equations to a free-body diagram of a differential ele-
ment of the belt enables us to derive the relation between the two belt tensions,
the contact angle , and the friction coefficient µs.

    Summing the forces in the x direction gives

                                       Fx = 0
                 µ dN + T cos(d/2) = (T + dT ) cos(d/2) = 0

                                   µ dN = dT cos(d/2)

As d approaches zero, cos(d/2) approaches one, so in the limit,

                                                 dT

                                                  µ
And summing forces in the y direction gives

 Fy = 0
dN = T sin(d/2) + (T + dT ) sin(d/2)
dN = (2T + dT ) sin(d/2)

      2T (d/2) + dT (d/2)

where we have used the small angle approximation sin(d/2)  d/2. Dropping
the second order differential term dT d as negligible, yields

                     dN = T d.

Solving simultaneously by eliminating dN leaves us with

                                            dT = µ d,
                                             T
which we can integrate between T- and TL to find

                     T+ dT 
                           = µ d

    Integrating both sides gives:

                                             T+ = eµ,
                                             T-

where e is the natural log base 2.718, µ is the friction coefficient between the belt
and pulley, and  is the contact angle between the belt and pulley in radians.
The larger this ratio is, the more torque the belt can transmit.

    Notice that the belt tension ratio is independent of the surface size and shape,
provided the belt makes continuous contact.

9.5.3 Torque in Belt Systems

A belt-driven systems consists of an input pulley driven by a rotational power
source and one or more output pulleys driving loads. The maximum torque that
can be transmitted by the system is determined by the maximum value for T+
before slipping occurs at either the input or any output pulley. We will need to
consider each of the pulleys independently.

Figure 9.5.8 Unequal Tensions

    Start by solving for the resting tension T-. This is the tension the belts prior
to any motion or power transfer. Practically, machines provide adjustments
to pre-tension the belt to insure sufficient normal force when started. When
we turn on the machine and increase the torque, the resting tension remains
constant while the tension on the drive side T+ increases.

    If the pulleys have the same coefficients of friction, it can be assumed that
the belt will first slip at the smaller of the two pulleys as the smaller pulley has
a smaller contact angle . See Figure 9.5.4.

    Once we have the maximum value for T-, we can use that to find the maxi-
mum input and output moments. Next, to find the torque, we then find the net
moment exerted by the two tension forces, where the radius of the pulley is the
moment arm.

    The maximum input torque Mi before slipping is

                       Mi = (T+max - T-)ri
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                  374

    The maximum output torque Mo before slipping is

                        Mo = (T+max - T-)ro

    In a rotating shaft, power is equal to the torque times the angular velocity

in radians per second.

                            P = T,                   (9.5.1)

so

                        Pmax = Mi(i) = Mo(o).        (9.5.2)

    Unlike the torque which steps up or down based on the pulley radii, the input
and output powers are equal to each other, ignoring all efficiency losses.

9.5.4 V-Belts

A flat belt pulley interacts with one surface of the belt. A V shaped pulley
allows the belt to wedge tightly in the groove, increasing friction and torque
transmission. A V-belt's enhanced friction comes from the increased normal
forces which are a function of the groove angle .

    The sum of the normal force vertical components is the same for a flat belt
or V-belt. However, the horizontal components of the normal forces in a V-belt,
effectively pinch the belt, thereby increasing the available friction force. The
belt should not contact the bottom of the groove, or else the wedge effect is lost

                                  µs

Figure 9.5.9 V-belt and pulley cross section.

    As we can see from the equation above, smaller groove angle and steeper sides
result in a larger maximum tension ratio, resulting in higher torque transmission.
The trade-off with steeper sides, however, is that the belt becomes wedged more
firmly in the groove and requires more force to unwedge itself as it leaves the
pulley. This unwedging force decreases the efficiency of the belt-driven system.
An alternate design choice would be a chain-drive which carries very high-tension
differences efficiently.

9.6 Journal Bearings

Key Questions

   · Why does the point of contact between a shaft and a journal bearing
       shift as the shaft rotates?

   · Why is the resultant contact force tangent to the friction circle?

   · Can you draw appropriate free-body diagrams of journal bearing
       systems and solve for unknown values?

9.6.1 Journal Bearing Friction

A bearing is a machine element used to support a rotating shaft. Bearing friction
exists between the rotating shaft and the supporting bearing. Though other
types of bearings exist including, ball, roller and hydrodynamic, we will focus on
dry friction journal bearings. Oil lubricated journal bearings require a knowledge
of fluid mechanics to analyze, while dry journal bearings have point contact
between the shaft and bearing and thus can be analyzed in Statics, they are
subject to greater wear and heat build-up than other types of bearings; thus,
the use of dry journal bearings is only advisable in situations where there is
limited motion.

9.6.2 Rotating Shaft and Fixed Bearing

A dry friction journal bearing consists circular bearing surface which supports
a rotating or stationary shaft. The support force acts at the single point of
tangency of the two circular surfaces. The bearing prevents shaft motion in the
radial directions but does not prevent axial motion due to shaft thrust.

    Figure 9.6.1 shows a journal bearing supporting a shaft with a vertical load
P . Initially the contact point is located directly below the load along its line
of action. When a clockwise moment M is applied to rotate the shaft, friction
between the shaft and bearing causes the surfaces to stick together, and the shaft
climbs up the bearing surface until impending motion is reached and slipping
occurs. Similarly, when a CCW moment M is applied, the contact point will
shift to the left.

Figure 9.6.1 Contact Point Shifts against the direction of relative motion of
the shaft with respect to the bearing.

    Free-body diagrams for the shaft in the three cases are shown in Figure 9.6.2.
At the contact points we see a normal force N and a friction force F which can be
resolved into a single vertical resultant force R. Normal forces are perpendicular
to shaft at the contact point, which makes their lines of action pass through the
center of the shaft. When no moment is applied, no friction exists, but in the
other two cases, friction creates a moment M  = F rf about the center of the
shaft which opposes the applied moment M .

Figure 9.6.2 Shaft Free-body Diagrams

    The most straightforward process to relate the load, normal and friction
forces for a journal bearing is by performing the following steps:

1. Assume that the shaft and bearing opening have the same radius, but
   draw the shaft a bit smaller to emphasizes the contact point at the point
   of tangency.

2. Combine the normal and friction forces into a single friction resultant force

                           R = F + N.

3. Determine the radius of the friction circle, rf , which is a circle around the
   center tangent to the friction resultant R. The friction circle radius is a
   function of the shaft radius r and the friction angle s.

                                  rf = r sin s = tan-1 F /N .
CHAPTER 9. FRICTION                                                377

4. Finally, draw a free-body diagram of the shaft with all applied loads and
   the friction resultant R, then solve the equations of equilibrium to find the
   unknowns.

9.6.3 Fixed Shaft and Rotating Bearing

Another type of journal bearing is designed with a fixed shaft and a rotating
bearing. While the solution process is quite similar to the process covered above,
the main difference is that you will draw a free-body diagram of the rotating
bearing instead of the shaft.

    Figure 9.6.3 shows the diagrams for a journal bearings with a fixed shaft and
rotating bearing.

Thinking Deeper 9.6.4 Contact Point Shift.

In this section we saw that the contact point shifts in the direction of
the relative impending motion of the bearing or opposite to the relative
motion of the shaft; This is true for dry friction bearings, but with oil
lubricated bearings, the shaft starts by a shift this way, but as the shaft
speed increases a hydrodynamic oil wedge forms which shifts the shaft in
the other direction in much the same way that a water skier lifts up and
skims the water at high speeds.

           circular areas, solid areas, and disc brakes with a circular arc and

       · Compute the possible moment the friction forces from disc friction

9.7.1 Disc Friction

Disc friction refers friction between a flat, rotating body and a stationary surface.
Disc friction exerts a moment on the bodies involved which resists the relative
rotation of the bodies. Disc friction is applicable to a wide variety of designs
including end bearings, collar bearings, disc brakes, and clutches.

Figure 9.7.1 This orbital sander rotates a circular sanding disc against a sta-
tionary surface. The disc friction between the sanding disc and the surface exert
a moment on both the surface and the sander.

9.7.2 Collar Bearings

A collar bearing, shown inFigure 9.7.2 has a rotating annular area in contact
with a stationary bearing surface. The rotating shaft passes through a hole or
bearing in the surface to maintain radial alignment. The collar bearing prevents
axial motion and acts as a thrust bearing to transfer the axial load to a solid
foundation.

(a) Side view                (b) Contact Area

Figure 9.7.2 Collar bearing

    The friction force at any point of the contact area will equal the normal
force at that point times the kinetic coefficient of friction at that point. If the
coefficient of friction and the pressure between the collar and the surface is the
same at all points, then the same friction force at every point is the same as
well. This does not mean that the moment exerted at every point is equal as
well. Elements towards the outside of the contact area cause larger moments
than those closer to the center since they have larger moment arms.

     Figure 9.7.3 Forces and mo-
     ments on differential areas

    The total moment exerted acting on the disc due to the friction forces is
found by integrating the elements dM over the contact area. The moment of
each element will be equal to the product of the coefficient of kinetic friction,
the normal force pressure, the moment arm and the area of each element

                                         dM = µkpr dA.

                                 A

The coefficient of friction and pressure terms are constant so can be moved

outside the integral, and since pressure is defined as force per unit are area

p = F /A, the pressure term can be replaced with the applied load divided by

the bearing contact area,

                                      P
                           p= 2 2 .

                                (ro - ri )

A differential element of area dA can be expressed in terms of radial distance

r allowing us to integrate with respect to r.

                              dA = 2rdr,

In cases where we have a solid circular contact area such as with a solid circular
shaft, an end bearing, or the orbital sander shown in Figure 9.7.1 we simply set
the inner radius to zero and simplify equation (9.7.1). If we do so, the result is

Automobile disc brakes have a contact area that looks like a section of the hollow
circular contact area we covered earlier.

Figure 9.7.5 The contact area in disc brakes is often approximated as a circular
arc with a contact angle .

    Disc brakes, due to their smaller contact area, have higher pressure for the
same applied force but a smaller area over which to exert friction. In the end,
these factors cancel out and we end up with the same formula we found in
Subsection 9.7.2. Notice that this formula is independent of .

Moments of Inertia

Area moments of inertia are a measure of the distribution of a two-dimensional
area around a particular axis. Fundamentally, the portions of a shape which are
located farther from the axis have a greater affect than the parts which are closer.
The primary application is in structural engineering and machine design where
they are used to determine a structural member's stiffness. Another application
is in Fluid Mechanics where they are used to determine the effect of pressure
on a submerged surface. We will use the symbol I for this property, along with
a subscript to indicate the specific axis, so for example, Ix would indicate the
"Area moment of inertia with respect to the x axis."

    Warning 10.0.1
    The mass moment of inertia you learned about in Physics is not the same
    as the area moment of inertia in Statics!
    This can be confusing since both are commonly shortened to "moment
    of inertia" and both use the same symbol, I. They have different units
    however, and the intended moment of inertia can easily be determined
    from context or with a unit analysis.

10.1 Integral Properties of Shapes

    Key Questions
        · Why does the area moment of inertia integral equation include a
           distance squared term?

        · When performing a single integral, either dx or dy, what is your
           differential element dA shape?

    As you know, two dimensional shapes like rectangles and circles have proper-
ties such as area, perimeter, and centroid. These are purely geometric properties

since they belong to the shape alone, in contrast to physical properties like weight
and mass which belong to real physical objects.

    In this section we introduce several new geometric properties useful in engi-
neering including the Area Moment of Inertia.

    The integral properties of shapes, along with the names and symbols com-
monly used to represent them are given in the table below. You are already
familiar with area from Geometry and the first moment of area from Chapter 7.
The remaining properties are the subject of this chapter. They all have a similar
form, and can be evaluated using similar integration techniques.

definitions below. It shows a generic plane area A, divided into differential
elements dA = dx dy. The differential element dA is an infinitesimally tiny
rectangle centered about point (x, y), which can range over the entire area. The
distances to the element from the y axis, the x axis and the origin are designated
x, y, and r respectively. The centroid of the entire area is located at (x¯, y¯).

All of these properties are defined as integrals over an area A. These integrals
may be evaluated by double-integrating over x and y in Cartesian coordinates or
r and  in polar coordinates. They can also be evaluated using single integration
using the methods demonstrated in Subsection 10.2.2.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                                             387

    None of these integrals can be evaluated until a specific shape is chosen.
When shape has been specified, the bounding functions and integration limits
can be determined and only then may the integral be solved using appropriate
integration techniques. If the shape is specified in general terms, say a rectangle
with base b and height h, then the result of the integration will be a formula for
the property applicable to all similar shapes.

10.1.1 Area

The total area of a shape is found by integrating the differential elements of
area over the entire shape.

                              A = dA.                       (10.1.1)

                                  A

The limit on this integral is indicated with an A to indicate that the integration

is carried out over the entire area. The resulting value will have units of [length]2

and does not depend on the position of the shape on the coordinate plane.

Since the area formulas for common shapes are well known, you only need

to use integration in uncommon situations.

10.1.2 First Moment of Area

The first moment of area, which was introduced in Chapter 7, is defined by
these two equations.

             Qx = y dA                      Qy = x dA       (10.1.2)

                           A                             A

and has units of [length]3.
    The first moment of area with respect to an axis is a measure of the distribu-

tion of the shape about an axis. It depends on the shape and also its location on
the coordinate plain. Portions of area on the negative side of the selected axis
make the first moment smaller, while areas on the positive side make it larger. If
the shape's centroid is located exactly on the axis, the integral will sum to zero
because the contributions of area above and below the axis cancel each other.

    The average value of the first moment of area is found by is found by dividing
the first moment by the area of the shape, and the result indicates the distance
from the axis to centroid of the shape.

10.1.3 Moment of Inertia

The area moment of inertia, the subject of this chapter, is defined by these
two equations.

Ix = y2 dA                      Iy = x2 dA     (10.1.3)

            A                               A

and has units of [length]4.
    As you can see, these equations are similar to the equations for the first

moment of area (10.1.2), except that the distance terms x and y are now squared.
In recognition of the similarity, the area moments of inertia are also known as
the second moments of area. We will use the terms moment of inertia and
second moment interchangeably. These two quantities are sometimes designated
as rectangular moments of inertia to distinguish them from the polar moment of
inertia described in the next section.

    Like the first moment, the second moment of area provides a measure of the
distribution of area around an axis, but in this case the distance to each element
is squared. This gives increased importance to portions of the area which are far
from the axis. Squaring the distance means that identical elements on opposite
sides of the axis both contribute to the sum rather than cancel each other out
as they do in the first moment. As a result, the moment of inertia is always a
positive quantity.

    Two identical shapes can have completely different moments of inertia, de-
pending on how the shape is distributed around the axis. A shape with most of
its area close to the axis has a smaller moment of inertia than the same shape
would if its area was distributed farther from the axis. This is a non-linear effect,
because when the distance term is doubled, the contribution of that element to
the sum increases fourfold.

Question 10.1.2

These three triangles are all the same size. Rank them from largest to
largest smallest moment of inertia with respect to the y axis.

                 A  B           C

Answer. From smallest to largest: IC > IA > IB.

Solution. Although the areas of all three triangles are the same, triangle
B has the area on both sides of the y axis and relatively close to it, and
so has the smallest I, while triangle C has the most of its area far from
the y axis which makes its moment of inertia largest. We will be able to
show later that the IC = 3IA = 9IB.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA  389

    Moving a shape away from the axis (or moving the axis away from the shape)
increases its moment of inertia, and moving it closer to the axis decreases it, until
it crosses to the other side of the axis, and then its moment of inertia will begin
to increase again.

    The minimum moment of inertia occurs when the centroid of the shape falls
on the axis. When this occurs, the moment of inertia is called the centroidal
moment of inertia. A bar over the symbol I is used to indicate that a moment
of inertia is centroidal. So for example, I¯x and I¯y represent the "centroidal
moment of inertia with respect to the x axis" and the "the centroidal moment
of inertia with respect to the y axis." The bar in this case does not mean that
moment of inertia is a vector quantity. Note that a shape can have multiple
centroidal moments of inertia, because more than one axis can pass through the
centroid of a shape. In this text, we will only the vertical and horizontal axes,
but they are not the only possibilities.

    The centroidal moment of inertia is particularly important. We will see in
(10.3.1) that if we know a shape's centroidal moment of inertia for some axis
direction, it is a simple process to calculate the moment of inertia of the shape
about any other parallel axis. The moment of inertia is used in Mechanics of
Materials to find stress and deflection in beams and to determine the load which
will cause a column to buckle.

    We stated earlier that the centroidal moment of inertia is the minimum mo-
ment of inertia, but by this we mean, the minimum moment of inertia for a
particular axis direction, for example horizontal. Other centroidal axes may
have a different moment of inertia, either larger or smaller than the moment of
inertia about a horizontal centroidal axis. The centroidal axes which have the
absolute minimum and maximum moment of inertia are called the principle axes.
The principle axes are not necessarily horizontal and vertical.

   Thinking Deeper 10.1.3 Beam bending.

   To get a feel for how moment of inertia affects engineering design, find
    a ruler, a yardstick, or something similar: long with a rectangular cross
    section.
   Try to bend the ruler both when it's flat and also when it's turned on edge.
   You will find that bending the ruler around the x axis while it's flat is easy
    compared to bending it the other way, around the z axis. Why is it easier
    to bend the ruler one way than the other? It's the same object, made of
    the same material either way.
   The answer has to due with the moment of inertia, and how it relates to
    the bending axis.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                                      390

Figure 10.1.4 Bending a ruler.

As engineers we are not satisfied with merely knowing that it's harder to
bend a ruler one way than the other, we'd like to know how much harder?
For a 1/8 in thick ruler that is 1 in tall, the bending resistance about the
z axis is over 20 times more than the bending resistance the other way,
about the x axis.
To further see how the moment of inertia comes into play, consider the
curvature caused by applying opposing moments to the ends of a beam
such as your ruler. You will cause it to bend into an arc of a circle of some
radius. A curious engineer would like to know how the curvature of the
beam is related to the applied moment, the geometry, and the physical
properties of the beam.

Figure 10.1.5 Beam of length L which is being bent by opposing couple-
moments to an arc with angle .

You will learn in Mechanics of Materials that the relationship is:

                   EI                                               (10.1.4)
        M =

                    L

where:
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA             391

       E is a material property called Young's Modulus or the modulus of
       elasticity which characterizes the stiffness of a material.

       L is the length of the beam, and

       I is the moment of inertia of the cross-section of the beam about the
       bending axis.

       M is the moment applied to the ends of the beam, and

        is the curvature of the beam.

Since E and I are in the numerator and L is in the denominator, a longer
beam is more flexible and larger values of E or I make the beam stiffer.
With those properties fixed, angle  is directly proportional to the moment
M.
The sag, or deflection, of a beam when supporting a load is also related
to these factors, and the placement of the load as well. For example, if
a beam is loaded with a concentrated force P at its center its maximum
deflection max will occur at the midpoint, with

                                                 P L3
                                       max = 48EI

10.1.4 Polar Moment of Inertia

The polar moment of inertia is defined as

JO = r2 dA                                 (10.1.5)

             A

and has units of [length]4.
    The polar moment of inertia is a another measure of the distribution of an

area but, in this case, about a point at the origin rather than about an axis.
One important application of this value is to quantify the resistance of a shaft
to torsion or twisting due to the shape of its cross-section.

Thinking Deeper 10.1.6 Why don't we call the polar moment of inertia
Iz ?

The squared distance in the polar moment of inertia formula is the distance
from the z axis, so it would seem reasonable to name the polar moment
Iz to be consistent with Ix and Iy, which use distances from the x and y
axes.
Instead engineers use the letter J to represent this quantity. Why?
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA  392

               Live Link

Figure 10.1.7 In-plane and out-of-plane rotation of element dA about
the x, y and z axes.

If areas only existed in the x-y plane, this would be fine, but the real world
is three-dimensional, so Iz must be reserved to use with areas in the x-z
or y-z plane.
As shown in the interactive, the rectangular moment of inertia I involves
rotating element dA about out-of-plane around an in-plain axis, and the
polar moment J involves rotating the element in-plane around a perpen-
dicular axis. The two quantities represent fundamentally different things.

10.1.5 Product of Inertia

The final property of interest is the product of inertia and it is defined as

Ixy = xy dA                     (10.1.6)

              A

where x and y are defined as in Figure 10.1.1. Like the others, the units as-
sociated with this quantity are [length]4. The name was chosen because the
distance squared term in the integral is the product of the element's coordinates.
In contrast to the other area moments, which are always positive, the product
of inertia can be a positive, negative or zero.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA  393

10.2 Moments of Inertia of Common Shapes

In following sections we will use the integral definitions of moment of inertia
(10.1.3) to find the moments of inertia of five common shapes: rectangle, trian-
gle, circle, semi-circle, and quarter-circle with respect to a specified axis. The
integration techniques demonstrated can be used to find the moment of inertia
of any two-dimensional shape about any desired axis.

    Moments of inertia depend on both the shape, and the axis. Pay attention
to the placement of the axis with respect to the shape, because if the axis is
located elsewhere or oriented differently, the results will be different.

    We will begin with the simplest case: the moment of inertia of a rectangle
about a horizontal axis located at its base. This case arises frequently and is
especially simple because the boundaries of the shape are all constants.

10.2.1 Moment of Inertia of a Rectangle

Consider the (b × h) rectangle shown. This rectangle is oriented with its bottom-
left corner at the origin and its upper-right corner at the point (b, h), where b
and h are constants.

    What is the moment of inertia of this rectangle with respect to the x axis?
    To find the moment of inertia, divide the area into square differential elements
dA at (x, y) where x and y can range over the entire rectangle and then evaluate
the integral using double integration.
    The differential element dA has width dx and height dy, so

dA = dx dy = dy dx.             (10.2.1)
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA              394

Live Link

Figure 10.2.1 Rectangle divided into vertical and horizontal differential strips

    It would seem like this is an insignificant difference, but the order of dx and
dy in this expression determines the order of integration of the double integral.
We will try both ways and see that the result is identical.

Using dA = dx dy

First, we will evaluate (10.1.3) using dA = dx dy.
    If you are not familiar with double integration, briefly you can think of a

double integral as two normal single integrals, one `inside' and the other `outside,'
which are evaluated one at a time from the inside out. Our integral becomes

           Ix = y2dA

                       A

           = y2 dx dy

                          dA

              top         right

           =                       y2dx dy

              bottom left

                              inside

                          outside
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                                  395

    The limits on double integrals are usually functions of x or y, but for this
rectangle the limits are all constants. The bottom and top limits are y = 0 and
y = h; the left and right limits are x = 0 and x = b. Note that the y2 term can
be taken out of the inside integral, because in terms of x, it is constant.

    Inserting dx dy for dA and the limits into (10.1.3), and integrating starting
with the inside integral gives

   Ix = y2dA

               A

                  hb

   =                                      y2 dx dy

               00

                  h                          b

   = y2 dx dy

               0                          0

                  h

   = y2 b dy

               0

                     h

   = b y2 dy

                  0

        y3 h
   =b

         30

.

   Evaluating the limit gives the result

                     bh3                                        (10.2.2)
               Ix = .

                       3

This is the formula for the moment of inertia of a rectangle about an axis passing
through its base, and is worth remembering.

       The boxed quantity is the result of the inside integral
   times dx, and can be interpreted as the differential area
   of a horizontal strip,

   dA = b dy.

 This will allow us to set up a problem as a single integral
 using strips and skip the inside integral completely as we
 will see in Subsection 10.2.2.

    This result means that the moment of inertia of the rectangle depends only
on the dimensions of the base and height and has units [length]4. The height
term is cubed and the base is not, which is unsurprising because the moment of
inertia gives more importance to parts of the shape which are farther away from
the axis. Doubling the width of the rectangle will double Ix but doubling the
height will increase Ix eightfold. In all moment of inertia formulas, the dimension
perpendicular to the axis is always cubed.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                              396

Warning 10.2.2

This result is for this particular situation; you will get a different result
for a different shape or a different axis.

Using dA = dy dx

Now, we will evaluate (10.1.3) using dA = dy dx which reverses the order of
integration and means that the integral over y gets conducted first. Since the
distance-squared term y2 is a function of y it remains inside the inside integral
this time and the result of the inside integral is not an area as it was previously.

    Inserting dy dx for dA and the limits into (10.1.3), and integrating gives

                Ix =          y2 dA    dy dx
                   =
                   =        A          h

                                       0
                            00

                                   dy

                            03

                =           b h3  dx

                            03

                =     h3 b        dx

                      bh3
                Ix = 3

.
    As before, the result is the moment of inertia of a rectangle with base b

and height h, about an axis passing through its base. We have found that the
moment of inertia of a rectangle about an axis through its base is (10.2.2), the
same as before.

The boxed quantity is the result of the inside integral

times dx, and can be interpreted as the differential mo-

ment of inertia of a vertical strip about the x axis. This

is consistent our previous result. The vertical strip has

a base of dx and a height of h, so its moment of inertia

by (10.2.2) is

                        h3             (10.2.3)
                dIx = dx.

                         3

    We will use these results to set up problems as a single integral which sum
the moments of inertia of the differential strips which cover the area in Subsec-
tion 10.2.3.

Example 10.2.3 Iy of a Rectangle.

    Find the moment of inertia of the rectangle
about the y axis using square differential ele-
ments dA.

Solution 1. Following the same procedure as before, we divide the rec-
tangle into square differential elements dA = dx dy and evaluate the dou-
ble integral for Iy from (10.1.3) first by integrating over x, and then over
y.

Iy =    x2dA
   =

             x2 dx dy

      03

      b3 h
   =y

       30
      b3h
Iy = 3

The formula for Iy is the same as the formula as we found previously for
Ix except that the base and height terms have reversed roles. Here, the
horizontal dimension is cubed and the vertical dimension is the linear term.
In all moment of inertia formulas, the dimension perpendicular to the axis
is cubed.

Solution 2. This solution demonstrates that the result is the same when
the order of integration is reversed. This time we evaluate Iy by dividing
the rectangle into square differential elements dA = dy dx so the inside
integral is now with respect to y and the outside integral is with respect

Centroidal Moment of Inertia

As discussed in Subsection 10.1.3, a moment of inertia about an axis passing
through the area's centroid is a Centroidal Moment of Inertia. The convention
is to place a bar over the symbol I when the axis is centroidal.

    The following example finds the centroidal moment of inertia for a rectangle
using integration.

    Example 10.2.4 Rectangle.

                        of a (b × h) rectangle about the x and y axes

Solution. We can use the same approach with dA = dy dx, but now the
limits of integration over y are now from -h/2 to h/2.

Notice that the centroidal moment of inertia of the rectangle is smaller

than the corresponding moment of inertia about the baseline.
The solution for I¯y is similar.

Thinking Deeper 10.2.5 Stresses in a Rectangular Beam.

To provide some context for area moments of inertia, let's examine the
internal forces in a elastic beam. Assume that some external load is caus-
ing an external bending moment which is opposed by the internal forces
exposed at a cut.
When an elastic beam is loaded from above, it will sag. Fibers on the top
surface will compress and fibers on the bottom surface will stretch, while
somewhere in between the fibers will neither stretch or compress. The
points where the fibers are not deformed defines a transverse axis, called
the neutral axis. The neutral axis passes through the centroid of the
beam's cross section.
The change in length of the fibers are caused by internal compression
and tension forces which increase linearly with distance from the neutral
axis. The internal forces sum to zero in the horizontal direction, but they
produce a net couple-moment which resists the external bending moment.

Figure 10.2.6 Internal forces in a beam caused by an external load.

Think about summing the internal moments about the neutral axis on the
beam cut face. This moment at a point on the face increases with the
square of the distance y of the point from the neutral axis because both
the internal force and the moment arm are proportional to this distance.
The appearance of y2 in this relationship is what connects a bending beam
to the area moment of inertia.
The shape of the beam's cross-section determines how easily the beam
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA  400

bends. A beam with more material farther from the neutral axis will have
a larger moment of inertia and be stiffer. Of course, the material of which
the beam is made is also a factor, but it is independent of this geometrical
factor.

10.2.2 Moment of Inertia of a Triangle

We saw in the last section that when solving (10.1.3) the double integration could
be conducted in either order, and that the result of completing the inside integral
was a single integral. We will use these observations to optimize the process of
finding moments of inertia for other shapes by avoiding double integration.

    The most straightforward approach is to use the definitions of the moment
of inertia (10.1.3) along with strips parallel to the designated axis, i.e. horizontal
strips when you want to find the moment of inertia about the x axis and vertical
strips for the moment of inertia about the y axis.

 The strip must be parallel in order for (10.1.3) to work; when parallel, all parts
of the strip are the same distance from the axis.

    This approach only works if the bounding function can be described as a
function of y and as a function of x, to enable integration with respect to x for
the vertical strip, and with respect to y for the horizontal strip.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA         401

Example 10.2.7 Triangle.

Live Link

Find the moment of inertia of the (b × h) right triangle with respect to
the x and y axes?

Solution. As we did when finding centroids in Section 7.7 we need to
evaluate the bounding function of the triangle. The bottom are constant
values, y = 0 and x = b, but the top boundary is a straight line passing
through the origin and the point at (b, h), which has the equation

                          y(x) = h x.  (10.2.4)
                                    b

By inspection we see that the a vertical strip extends from the x axis to
the function so dA = y dx.
Since vertical strips are parallel to the y axis we can find Iy by evaluating
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                             402

this integral with dA = y dx, and substituting bh x for y

.

Similarly we will find Ix using horizontal strips, by evaluating this integral
with dA = (b - x)dy

                                       Ix = y2dA

                                                                       A

.
We are expressing dA in terms of dy, so everything inside the integral must
be constant or expressed in terms of y in order to integrate. In particular,
we will need to solve (10.2.4) for x as a function of y. This is not difficult.

                                        x(y) = b y.
                                                  h

This is the moment of inertia of a right triangle about an axis passing

through its base. By reversing the roles of b and h, we also now have the

moment of inertia of a right triangle about an axis passing through its

vertical side.                          hb3

10.2.3 Moment of Inertia of a Differential Strip

We saw in Subsection 10.2.2 that a straightforward way to find the moment of
inertia using a single integration is to use strips which are parallel to the axis of
interest, so use vertical strips to find Iy and horizontal strips to find Ix.

    This method requires expressing the bounding function both as a function
of x and as a function of y: y = f (x) and x = g(y). There are many functions
where converting from one form to the other is not easy.

    As an example, lets try finding Ix and Iy for the spandrel bounded by

                        y = f (x) = x3 + x, the x axis, and x = 1.

    Finding Iy using vertical strips is relatively
easy. Letting dA = y dx and substituting y =
f (x) = x3 + x we have

                Iy = x2 dA

                                     A
                                       1

                   = x2y dx

                                     0
                                       1

                   = x2(x3 + x) dx

                                     0
                                       1

                   = (x5 + x3)dx

                                     0

                Iy = 12

.

    Finding Ix using horizontal strips is anything but easy. In fact, the integral
that needs to be solved is this monstrosity

Ix =               y2 (1 - x) dy
   =
                A                                     2/3

                  . . . and then a miracle occurs

                      49
              Ix = 120

.
    Clearly, a better approach would be helpful.
    When using strips which are parallel to the axis of interest is impractical

mathematically, the alternative is to use strips which are perpendicular to the
axis.

    Applying our previous result (10.2.2) to a vertical strip with height h and
infinitesimal width dx gives the strip's differential moment of inertia. In most
cases, h will be a function of x.

      bh3                          h3                                (10.2.5)

                                   3

. This is the same result that we saw previously (10.2.3) after integrating the
inside integral for the moment of inertia of a rectangle.

    This result makes it much easier to find Ix for the spandrel that was nearly
impossible to find with horizontal strips.

                  49
           Ix = 120

    The same approach can be used with a horizontal strip dy high and b wide,
in which case we have

      b3h                                        b3                  (10.2.6)
Iy = 3                 dIy = 3 dy

. The width b will usually have to be expressed as a function of y.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                               405

    The expression for dIx assumes that the ver-
tical strip has a lower bound on the x axis. If

this is not the case, then find the dIx for the
area between the bounds by subtracting dIx for
the rectangular element below the lower bound

from dIx for the element from the x axis to the
upper bound. A similar procedure can be used

for horizontal strips.

This approach is illustrated in the next example.

Example 10.2.8 Moment of Inertia for Area Between Two Curves.

                                          Use vertical strips to find both Ix and Iy
                                     for the area bounded by the functions

                                                         y1 = x2/2 and,
                                                         y2 = x/4

                                     . Units are cm.

Solution.                                         y2 = x2/2
   1. Set up the integral.
       The area is bounded by the functions

                            y2 = x/4

By equating the two functions, we learn that they intersect at (0, 0)
and (1/2, 1/8), so the limits on x are x = 0 and x = 1/2.
The differential area dA for vertical strip is

                                                  x x2
                    dA = (y2 - y1) dx = - dx.

   For vertical strips, which are parallel to the y axis we can use the
   definition of the Moment of Inertia.

10.2.4 Circles, Semicircles, and Quarter-circles

In this section, we will use polar coordinates and symmetry to find the moments
of inertia of circles, semi-circles and quarter-circles.

    We will start by finding the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius r,
centered at the origin. You will recall from Subsection 10.1.4 that the polar mo-
ment of inertia is similar to the ordinary moment of inertia, except the distance
squared term is the distance from the element to a point in the plane rather than
the perpendicular distance to an axis, and it uses the symbol J with a subscript
indicating the point.

    To take advantage of the geometry of a circle, we'll divide the area into thin
rings, as shown in the diagram, and define the distance from the origin to a
point on the ring as . The reason for using thin rings for dA is the same reason
we used strips parallel to the axis of interest to find Ix and Iy; all points on
the differential ring are the same distance from the origin, so we can find the
moment of inertia using single integration.

Figure 10.2.9 Circle divided into differential rings

    The differential area of a circular ring is the circumference of a circle of radius
 times the thickness d.

                                          dA = 2 d.

    Adapting the basic formula for the polar moment of inertia (10.1.5) to our
labels, and noting that limits of integration are from  = 0 to  = r, we get

                                       r

           JO = r2 dA               JO = 2 2 d  (10.2.7)

                r4
         JO = 2

.
    This is the polar moment of inertia of a circle about a point at its center.
    With this result, we can find the rectangular moments of inertia of circles,

semi-circles and quarter circle simply. Noting that the polar moment of inertia
of a shape is the sum of its rectangular moments of inertia Ix and Iy, these
are equal to each other for a circle due to its symmetry. Therefore, by (10.5.2),
which is easily proven,

y

                                  JO = Ix + Iy

   x                              I¯x = I¯y = JO = r4  (10.2.9)
                                  24

      .

    This is the moment of inertia of a circle about a vertical or horizontal axis
passing through its center.

    A circle consists of two semi-circles above and below the x axis, so the moment
of inertia of a semi-circle about a diameter on the x axis is just half of the moment

    In these diagrams, the centroidal axes are red, and moments of inertia about
centroidal axes are indicated by the overbar. We will see how to use the parallel
axis theorem to find the centroidal moments of inertia for semi- and quarter-
circles in Section 10.3.

10.2.5 Summary of Integration Techniques

Here is a summary of the alternate approaches to finding the moment of inertia
of a shape using integration.

    You may choose to divide the shape into square differential elements to com-
pute the moment of inertia, using the fundamental definitions, The disadvantage
of this approach is that you need to set up and compute a double integral. Iden-
tifying the correct limits on the integrals is often difficult.

    If you would like to avoid double integration, you may use vertical or hori-
zontal strips, but you must take care to apply the correct integral. If you use
vertical strips to find Iy or horizontal strips to find Ix, then you can still use
(10.1.3), but skip the double integration. When the entire strip is the same
distance from the designated axis, integrating with a parallel strip is equivalent
to performing the inside integration of (10.1.3).

    As we have seen, it can be difficult to solve the bounding functions properly
in terms of x or y to use parallel strips. In this case, you can use vertical strips to
find Ix or horizontal strips to find Iy as discussed by integrating the differential
moment of inertia of the strip, as discussed in Subsection 10.2.3.

10.3 Parallel Axis Theorem

The parallel axis theorem relates the moment of inertia of a shape about an
arbitrary axis to its moment of inertia about a parallel centroidal axis.

    This theorem is particularly useful because if we know the centroidal moment
of inertia of a shape, we can calculate its moment of inertia about any parallel
axis by adding an appropriate correction factor. Alternately, if we know the
moment of inertia about an axis, we can find the associated centroidal moment
of inertia by subtracting the same factor.

    The centroidal moment of inertia of common shapes are well known, and
readily available in tables of properties of shapes such as Subsection 10.3.2.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                        412

10.3.1 Derivation

    We will use the defining equation for the  dA
moment of inertia (10.1.3) to derive the par-
allel axis theorem.                            y C    x

    The diagram shows an arbitrary shape,          y
and two parallel axes: the x axis, drawn in
red, passes through the centroid of the shape  dA
at C, and the x axis, which is parallel and
separated by a distance, d. The shape has             x
area A, which is divided into square differ-
ential elements dA. The distance from the x    Figure 10.3.1 Definitions for
axis to the element dA is y, and the distance  the parallel axis theorem.
from the x axis is y.

    By (10.1.3), the moment of inertia of the
shape about the x and x axes are

   Ix = y2 dA     I¯x = (y)2 dA

               A               A

    The first is the value we are looking for, and the second is the centroidal
moment of inertia of the shape. These two are related through the distance
d, because y = d + y. Substituting that relation into the first equation and
expanding the binomial gives

                  Ix = (d + y)2dA

                              A

                  = (y)2 + 2 y d + d2 dA

                         A

                  = (y)2dA + 2d ydA + d2 dA

.                  A               A           A

   You should recognize these three integrals. The first is the centroidal moment

of inertia of the shape I¯x, and the third is the total area of the shape, A. The

middle integral is Qx, the first moment of area (10.1.2) with respect to the

centroidal axis x. So we have,

                      Ix = I¯x + 2dQx + d2A.

    Furthermore, Qx is exactly zero because the x axis passes through the cen-
troid, meaning that elements of area above and below the centroidal axis exactly
balance and cancel each other out. After dropping the middle term we get the
version of the parallel axis theorem which you should remember,

                                I = I¯ + Ad2.         (10.3.1)

    The subscripts designating the x and x axes have been dropped because this
equation is applicable to any direction of parallel axes, not specifically horizontal
axes.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                                413

    This equation says that you find the moment of inertia of a shape about
any axis by adding Ad2 to the parallel centroidal moment of inertia. You can
consider the Ad2 term as `correction factor' to account for the distance of the
axis from the centroid. This term is always positive, so the centroidal moment of
inertia is always the minimum moment of inertia for a particular axis direction.

    The next example show how the parallel axis theorem is typically used to
find the moment of inertia of a shape about an axis, by using then centroidal
moment of inertia formulas found in Subsection 10.3.2.

Example 10.3.2 Circular Ring.

y     y

   d                               Use the parallel axis theorem to
   a                           find the moment of inertia of the cir-
                               cular ring about the y axis.

                                   The dimensions of the ring are
                               Ri = 30 mm, Ro = 45 mm, and
                               a = 80 mm.

Solution. To apply the parallel axis theorem, we need three pieces of
information

1. The centroidal moment of inertia of the ring, Iy,

2. the area of the ring, A,

3. the distance between the two parallel axes, d.

The area of the ring is found by subtracting the area of the inner circle
from the area of the outer circle. The centroidal moment of inertia is
calculated similarly using (10.2.9). The distance between the y and y axis
is available from the diagram. Inserting these values into the parallel axis
theorem gives,

      Iy = Iy + Ad2

      =  ro4 - ri4             +  ro2 - ri2                2
         4
                                             a + ro

         I¯y                    A                  d2

      =  454 - 304 +  452 - 302 (80 + 45)2
         4

      = 2.58 × 106 mm4 + 55.2 × 106 mm4

      Iy = 57.8 × 106 mm4

It is interesting that the `correction factor' is more than 20 times greater
than the centroidal moment of inertia of the ring. This indicates the
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                                   414

   importance of the distance squared term on the moment of inertia of a
   shape.

    You may feel like the answer to this problem is "too big". Large answers
   are normal in problems like this because the moment of inertia involves
   raising lengths the fourth power.

       If it really bothers you, you can convert the results from mm4 to m4,
   but then the number will probably feel "too small" to you. It's best not
   to worry about it.

    The parallel axis theorem can also be used to find a centroidal moment of
inertia when you already know the moment of inertia of a shape about another
axis, by using the theorem `backwards',

   I = I¯ + Ad2                 I¯ = I - Ad2

.

and h.

                           x of inertia about its base is

                                                              Ix =  r4.

the parallel axes is d = 3 4r , so

                      I¯x = Ix - Ad2

10.4 Composite Shapes

   Key Questions

       · Where do the common shape area moment of inertia equations come
           from?

       · What is the parallel axis theorem?

       · When do you need to apply the parallel axis theorem?

       · About which point do you find the smallest area moments of inertia?
           What is it about this point that is so special?

    In this section we will find the moment of inertia of shapes formed by com-
bining simple shapes like rectangles, triangles and circles much the same way we
did to find centroids in Section 7.5.

    The procedure is to divide the complex shape into its sub shapes and then
use the centroidal moment of inertia formulas from Subsection 10.3.2, along with
the parallel axis theorem (10.3.1) to calculate the moments of inertia of parts,
and finally combine them to find the moment of inertia of the original shape.

10.4.1 Composite Area Method

For a composite shape made up of n subparts, the moment of inertia of the whole
shape is the sum of the moments of inertia of the individual parts, however the
moment of inertia of any holes are subtracted from the total of the positive areas.

    Moments of inertia are always calculated relative to a specific axis, so the
moments of inertia of all the sub shapes must be calculated with respect to this
same axis, which will usually involve applying the parallel axis theorem.

   The method is demonstrated in the following examples.

   Example 10.4.1 Beam Design.

   You have three 24 ft long wooden 2×6's and you want to nail them to-
   gether them to make the stiffest possible beam. The stiffness of a beam
   is proportional to the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section about
   a horizontal axis passing through its centroid. The actual dimensions of
   nominal 2×6 lumber are 1.5 in by 5.5 in.

Which of the arrangements will be the stiffest, and what is the ratio of the
two moments of inertia?

Solution. Given: b = 1.5 in, h = 5.5 in.
In case 1 the centroids of all three rectangles are on the x axis, so the
parallel axis theorem is unnecessary.

This value is the same as the moment of inertia of a (4.5 in × 5.5 in)
rectangle about its centroid.
In case 2, the parallel axis theorem must be used for the upper and lower
rectangles, since their centroids are not on the x axis.

The I-beam is about 3.6 times stiffer than the sandwich beam. This opti-
mization of material usage is the reason we use I-beams.

Solution.

   1. Strategy.

       Divide the T shape into a 30 mm×60 mm vertical rectangle (1), and
       a 90 mm × 20 mm horizontal rectangle (2) then add the moments of
       inertia of the two parts.

       Ix = (Ix)1 + (Ix)2         Iy = (Iy)1 + (Iy)2

2. MOI about the x Axis.

   The bottom edge of rectangle 1 is on the x axis. Using the formula
   from Subsection 10.3.2 gives

       (I bh3 (30)(60)3 x)1 = = = 2.16 × 106 mm4.
                         3     3

   The centroid of rectangle 2 is located 70 mm above the x axis so we
   must use the parallel axis theorem (10.3.1), so

       (Ix)2 = I¯ + Ad2

             = bh3 + (bh)d2
                  12

             = (90)(20)3 + (90 × 20)(70)2
                     12

       (Ix)2 = 8.88 × 106 mm4

   .

   The moment of inertia of the entire T shape about the x axis is the
   sum of these two values,

       Ix = (Ix)1 + (Ix)2 = 11.04 × 106 mm4.

3. MOI about the y Axis.

   We can use the same procedure to find the moment of inertia about
   the y axis, however it is usually more convenient to organize all the
   necessary information in a table rather than writing the equations
   explicitly.

   We will use the parallel axis theorem for both rectangles with d
   representing the distance between the y axis and the centroid of the
   part. In this example d is the same for both parts, but that will not
   always be true.

First, divide the area into four y

parts:                                                                             3

                                                                                   2          4

     3 in radius.

Then set up a table and apply the parallel axis theorem (10.3.1) as in
the previous example. Since the quarter-circle is removed, subtract
its moment of inertia from total of the other shapes.

2. MOI about the y Axis.

   The centroidal moment of inertia of a quarter-circle, from Subsec-
   tion 10.3.2 is

                      Ix =  - 4 r4
                               16 9

                         = 0.0549 r4

The distance from the top edge of the quarter-circle down to its
centroid is 4r = 1.273 in, so the distance from the x axis to its
centroid is 3

                            d = 6 - 1.27 = 4.727 in.

Take care to subtract the moment of inertia of the removed quarter-
circle from the total.

The cross section of a concrete pipe casing composed of a rectangular block,
a triangular wedge, and a circular pipe formed through the middle of the
block is shown below.
As the pipe casing will be subject to various loads, find the area moment
of inertia of the cross section about the x and y axes.

       Organize all the necessary information into a table, then total the
       moments of inertia of the parts to get the moment of inertia of the
       whole shape. Remember that the hole is removed from the shape,
       so its contribution to the total moment of inertia is negative.

sums of the columns, since you are adding the same values together,
just in a different order.

Example 10.4.5 Interactive: Composite Rectangles.

This interactive shows a composite shape consisting of a large rectangle
with a smaller rectangle subtracted. You can change the location and size
of the rectangles by moving the red and blue points.
Use the interactive to see how changes to the rectangles affects the mo-
ments of inertia of this shape about the system x axis. Notice that for
two-part shapes like this, the centroid of the composite shape is on the
line connecting the centroids of the two parts.
For calculations, it is convenient to collect all the needed information in a
table as is done here.

10.4.2 Structural Steel Sections

Steel is a strong, versatile, and durable material commonly used for girders,
beams, and columns in steel structures such as buildings, bridges, and ships.
When possible designers prefer to use prefabricated Standardized Structural Steel
to minimize material cost.

    Structural steel is available in a variety of shapes called sections, shown
below. These include universal beams and columns (W, S), structural channels
(C), equal and unequal angle sections (L), Tee shapes (T), rectangular, square
and round hollow structural sections (HSS), bar, rod, and plate. All are available
in a range of sizes from small to huge. Steel sections are manufactured by hot
or cold rolling or fabricated by welding flat or curved steel plates together.

ican Standard (S), Channel (C), Equal Angle (L), Unequal Angle (L), Structural
Tee (T), Rectangle (HSS), Square (HSS), Round (HSS).

    Designers and engineers must select the most appropriate and economical
section which can support the potential tension, compression, shear, torsion and
bending loads. Tables of properties of Standard Steel Sections are published
by the American Institute of Steel Construction, and are used to simplify the
process. The tables contain important properties of the sections, including di-
mensions, cross sectional area, weight per foot, and moment of inertia about
vertical and horizontal axes. An abbreviated subset of the AISC tables are
available in Appendix D.

    In this section we will use the information in the AISC tables to find the mo-
ments of inertia of standard sections and also of composite shapes incorporating
standard sections.

    The top and bottom pieces of an I-beam are          depth             al plane
called flanges. The middle portion is referred to as                Neutr
the web. The flanges take most of the internal com-            Neutral Axis
pression and tension forces as they are located the
furthest from the neutral axis, and the web mainly      Figure 10.4.8 Beam
acts to support any shear forces and hold the two       Nomenclature
flanges apart. The transverse axis through the cen-
troid of the cross section is called the neutral axis,
and cutting plane through the beam at the neutral
axis is called the neutral plane, or neutral surface.
This surface does not lengthen or shorten during
bending.

   Determine the properties of the sub shapes with respect to the x
   axis, and then use them to find the neutral axis.

   positioned similarly.

10.5 Polar Moment of Inertia

   Key Questions

      · How are polar moments of inertia similar and different to area mo-
          ments of inertia about either a horizontal or vertical axis?

       The polar moment of inertia is defined by the
   integral quantity

   JO = r2dA,                                (10.5.1)

                A

   where r is the distance from the reference point to a

   differential element of area dA.                       O

    The polar moment of inertia describes the distribution of the area of a body
with respect to a point in the plane of the body. Alternately, the point can be
considered to be where a perpendicular axis crosses the plane of the body. The
subscript on the symbol j indicates the point or axis.

    There is a particularly simple relationship between the polar moment of
inertia and the rectangular moments of inertia. Referring to the figure, apply
the Pythagorean theorem r2 = x2 + y2 to the definition of polar moment of
inertia to get

   JO = r2 dA

                A

   = (x2 + y2) dA

          A

       = x2dA +                                y2dA

                A                            A

   JO = Ix + Iy                                              (10.5.2)

.

   Thinking Deeper 10.5.1 Torsional Stress.

   The polar moment of inertia is an important factor in the design of drive
   shafts. When a shaft is subjected to torsion, it experiences internal dis-
   tributed shearing forces throughout its cross-section which counteract the
   external torsional load.
   This distributed shearing force is called shear stress, and is usually given
   the symbol tau,  . Shear stress is zero at the shaft centerline, called the
   neutral axis, and increases linearly with r to a maximum value, max at
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                         431

the outside surface where r = c, so
                                                    r

                                          = max c

   Figure 10.5.2 Section cut through a shaft, showing the shearing stresses
   developed to withstand an external torsion, T .
   The force at any point is dF =  dA, and the moment dM exerted at any
    point is dF times the moment arm, r. The total moment is the integral
    of this quantity over the area of the cross section, and is proportional to
    the polar moment of inertia.

                                        T = dM

                                           = r dF

   This is the relationship between the maximum stress in a circular shaft,
    the applied torque T , and the geometric properties of the shaft JO and c.

10.6 Radius of Gyration

The radius of gyration is an alternate way of expressing the distribution of area
away from an axis which combines the effects of the moments of inertia and cross
sectional area.

    The radius of gyration can be thought of as the radial distance to a thin
strip which has the same area and the same moment of inertia around a specific
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                                       432

axis as the original shape. Compared to the moment of inertia, the radius of
gyration is easier to visualize since it's a distance, rather than a distance to the
fourth power.

    The radius of gyration, k and the corresponding moment of inertia I are
related, and both must refer to the same axis. If one is known, the other is
easily found.

    The radius of gyration with respect to the x and y axes and the origin are
given by these formulas

             kx = Ix           ky = Iy           ko = Jo             (10.6.1)
                        A                A                 A

.

In engineering design, the radius of gyration is used to determine the stiffness

of structural columns and estimate the critical load which will initiate column

buckling.

Example 10.6.1
How are kx, ky, and ko related to each other?
Solution. Start with (10.5.2)

           Jo = Ix + Iy                     divide each term by A
                                            apply definitions of k2
           Jo = Ix + Iy
           A AA
           ko2 = kx2 + ky2

Example 10.6.2

    Determine the polar moment of inertia and the
radius of gyration of the shaded area. Give answer
in terms of r, to three significant digits.

Solution. The shape is consists of a quarter circle of radius r with a
triangle removed. For the triangle, b = h = r.

                           A = r2 - (r)(r) = 0.285 r2
                            4   2

                           I r4 (r)(r3) x = - = 0.113 r4
                            16  12

                           Iy = Ix by symmetry.

                           Jo = Ix + Iy = 2Ix = 0.226 r4
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA                                           433

                    ko =  Jo =        0.226 r4
                          A           0.285 r2 = 0.890 r

10.7 Products of Inertia

Key Questions
   · Why do we need to quantify the product of inertia for beams?
   · Why is the product of inertia of a symmetrical cross section zero?

                                      y               y

The product of inertia is an-

other integral property of area, and

is defined as

Ixy = xy dA.              (10.7.1)

               A x

The parallel axis theorem for prod-

ucts of inertia is

Ixy = I¯xy + Ax¯y¯.       (10.7.2)                                       x

                                      O

    Unlike the rectangular moments of inertia, which are always positive, the
product of inertia may be either positive, negative, or zero, depending on the
object's shape and the orientation of the coordinate axes. The product of inertia
will be zero for symmetrical objects when a coordinate axis is also an axis of
symmetry.

    If the product of inertia is not zero it is always possible to rotate the co-
ordinate system until it is, in which case the new coordinate axes are called
the principle axes. When the coordinate axes are oriented in the principle
directions, the centroidal moments of inertia are maximum about one axis and
minimum about the other, but neither is necessarily zero. The principle direc-
tions determine the best way to orient a beam to for maximum stiffness, and
how much asymmetrical beams, like channels and angles, will twist when a load
is applied.

10.8 Mass Moment of Inertia

You may recall from physics the relationship
                                              T = I.
CHAPTER 10. MOMENTS OF INERTIA  434

This formula is the rotational analog of Newton's second law F = ma. Here,
the I represents the mass moment of inertia, which is the three-dimensional
measure of a rigid body's resistance to angular acceleration around an axis. Mass
moment of inertia plays the same role for rotational acceleration as mass does
for linear acceleration.

    Mass moment of inertia is defined by an integral equation identical to (10.1.3),
except that the differential area dA is replaced with a differential element of
mass, dm. The integration is conducted over a three dimensional physical object
instead of a two dimensional massless area.

    The units of mass moment of inertia are [mass][length]2, in contrast to area
moment of inertia's units of [length]4.

    Mass moments of inertia are covered in more detail and used extensively in
the study of rigid body kinetics in Engineering Dynamics.

B.1 Distance Formula

The distance formula is used for finding the distance between two points. In two
dimensions it is simply an application of the Pythagorean theorem.

Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) the distance between them is:

d = (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2                                           (B.1.1)

.
    Extension of the distance formula to three dimensions is straightforward.

d = (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2                              (B.1.2)

B.2 Right Triangle Trigonometry

A right triangle is a triangle containing a 90° angle.
    The side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse.
    The other two angles add to 90° and are called complementary angles.

APPENDIX B. USEFUL MATHEMATICS                                                 440

    The relationship between the sides and angles of a right triangle are given by
the three basic trig relations which may be recalled with the mnemonic SOH-
CAH-TOA.

   sin  = opposite         cos  = adjacent            tan  = opposite
             hypotenuse              hypotenuse                 adjacent

and their inverses,

 = sin-1 opposite           = cos-1 adjacent           = tan-1 opposite
               hypotenuse                 hypotenuse                 adjacent

Facts. The following statements regarding the trig functions and triangles are
always true, and remembering them will help you avoid errors.

   · sin, cos and tan are functions of an angle and their values are unitless
       ratios of lengths.

   · The inverse trig functions are functions of unitless ratios and their results
       are angles.

   · The sine of an angle equals the cosine of its complement and vice-versa.

   · The sine and cosine of any angle is always a unitless number between -1
       and 1, inclusive.

   · The sine, cosine, and tangent of angles between 0 and 90° are always
       positive.

   · The inverse trig functions of positive numbers will always yield angles
       between 0 and 90°

   · The legs of a right triangle are always shorter than the hypotenuse.

   · Only right triangles have a hypotenuse.

Hints. Here are some useful tips for angle calculations

· Take care that your calculator is set in degrees mode for this course.

· Always work with angles between 0° and 90° and use positive arguments
   for the inverse trig functions.

· Following this advice will avoid unwanted signs and incorrect directions
caused because -a = a , and a = -a and the calculator can't distin-

guish between them.

B.3 Oblique Triangle Trigonometry

An oblique triangle is any triangle which does not contain a right angle. As such,
the rules of Right Triangle Trigonometry do not apply!

    For an oblique triangle labeled as
shown, the relations between the sides
and angles are given by the Law of
Sines and the Law of Cosines.

B.3.1 Law of Sines

                         sin a sin b sin c               (B.3.1)
                                   =        =
                         A            B        C

The law of Sines is used when you know the length of one side, the angle

opposite it, and one additional angle (SAA) or side (SSA). If this is not the case

use the Law of Cosines.

Take care in the (SSA) situation. This is known as the ambiguous case,

and you must be alert for it. It occurs because there are two angles between 0

and 180° with the same sine. When you use your calculator to find sin-1(x) it

may return the supplement of the angle you want. In fact, there may be two

possible solutions to the problem, or one or both solutions may be physically

impossible and must be discarded.

If one of the angles is 90°, then the Law of Sines simplifies to the definitions

of sine and cosine since the sin(90°) = 1.
APPENDIX B. USEFUL MATHEMATICS  442

B.3.2 Law of Cosines

A2 = B2 + C2 - 2BC cos a        (B.3.2)
B2 = A2 + C2 - 2AC cos b        (B.3.3)
C2 = A2 + B2 - 2AB cos c        (B.3.4)

    The Law of Cosines is used when you know two sides and the included angle
(SAS), or when you know all three sides but no angles (SSS). In any other
situation, use the Law of Sines.

    If one of the angles is 90 the Law of Cosines simplifies to the Pythagorean
Theorem since cos(90°) = 0.
