communication in multiple platforms, making both the development and delivery of various media across appropriate
modes more nuanced than in days past. Not all delivery modes will be suitable for selected content and not all content can
be conveyed across all communication platforms.
With these factors in mind, engineering students must be prepared in technical communication skills far exceeding the
requirements of decades passed. Engineering students must craft materials with the audience and delivery method in
mind, using available technologies to facilitate both content generation and delivery, to optimize successful conveyance of
ideas, results, conclusions, proposals, methodologies and more.
It is because of this professional skill set that this course supports the development of engineering students in

Basic Mechanics of
Technical Writing

In this section, you will be introduced to some basic approaches to technical writing that will support your work
in this course. While specific types of documents and details into presenting research or engineering work will be
discussed in greater detail in subsequent chapters, this chapter provides fundamental hallmarks of technical
writing that will be true of all documents discussed in the book.

Concise

Students typically assume that writing longer
documents will result in higher grades. Oftentimes
engineering students have been told by English
teachers that they need to add details to paint
pictures for their readers. Many assignments in
English composition courses have minimum word
counts, which reinforce the idea that more is better.
In technical writing, sometimes "more" is simply
too much.

Concise writing eliminates unnecessary words
which can make the writing vague, unclear or
distract from the main idea of the work. A
technical writing sample includes enough detail to
convey clearly and correctly what occurred (or is
being instructed) without the use of superfluous
language.

Phrases

Consider the two phrases in the text box to the
right-hand side of the page [1].

Each of these phrases identifies an action which
needs to occur and the desired outcome, but the
first sentence is 19 words and the second sentence
is only 7. The additional 12 words of the first
sentence do not change the meaning but simply
take up space in the document.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 10
Verb usage

Verbs themselves can assist in making documents
more concise when conjugated appropriately.
Consider the following [1]:

"Is indicative of" compared to "indicates"

"has knowledge of" compared to "knows"

These phrases are identical in meaning, but the
active form of the verb makes the sentence clearer
and more concise.

Prepositions                                         Expletive constructions

Prepositions can add clarity of possession and       The constructions "It is, there is, there are" all

additional descriptors. Consider the following [1]:

"The attitudes of the subject indicate that"         materials will increase in the future."

"The subject's attitude indicate that"               "Construction costs will increase."

While only two words were eliminated, there is       Note that the second option eliminates the
additional clarity of ownership in the second        redundancy in time ("will increase" conveys as

Correct

Correctness in technical writing can refer to
multiple qualities of the document, including
technical correctness and grammatical correctness.
A technically correct document is free from errors
in the material being presented, including
calculations, graphical presentations, appropriate
use of analytical tools, accurate portrayal of
context and methodologies and logical discussion
or conclusion from the material being presented.
Many of these areas will be addressed in
subsequent chapters of this book.

Grammatical correctness is also essential, as
incorrect word selection, improper punctuation
and misuse of grammatical conventions can both
cause the reader to doubt the material being
presented and change its meaning. While basic
grammar is addressed in introductory composition
coursework, several grammatical principles are
critically important to technical documents.

  Abbreviations

     Technical documents often require discipline specific jargon and abbreviations. It is important that all
     abbreviations are properly defined prior to their ongoing use within the document. It is helpful to use
     abbreviations for items that appear more than three times within a single document. For example, if you will be
     frequently using the term "parts per million", it may be abbreviated "ppm". Some abbreviations, such as CO2 can
     be assumed to be common knowledge and do not need to be written out prior to use. When in doubt, the author
     should provide the written form, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses (e.g. carbon dioxide (CO2)) at its
     first use within the document.

Acronyms                                                Numerals

document poorly written is not only ineffectual at
communicating important content but also reflects
poorly on the author. When you present work that
has errors, your audience can doubt the
competency of the work being presented in
addition to questioning your skill as a writer. In
this section, several wording choices are presented
to assist you in crafting your documents.

Common misused words

or phrases in writing

More often than not, when I see a misspelling in
student work, it is actually a word that was
autocorrected or auto suggested by the word
processing program. While spell check and
grammar check can be helpful, proofreading is
essential for all work to catch common errors, like
those in the table below or in the cartoon along the
right side of this page [6]. Many of these words are
homophones (words that sound the same but are
spelled differently and mean different things)
which make them more difficult to catch when
proofreading. When speaking, the difference
between "compliment" and "complement" can be
subtle to the ear. When writing, it would be easy to
misspell the word and thereby change the meaning
of your sentence. Several of the most common
examples are included in the table.

Accept - to receive                         Commonly Misused Words
Advice - guidance                                              Except - to exclude
Affect - change or influence                                   Advise - to give counsel
All ready - all people or things are ready                     Effect - the result
Complement - the whole or entire                               Already - having been completed
Eminent - distinguished                                        Compliment - give praise
Everyday - ordinary                                            Imminent - about to happen
Farther - a great distance                                     Every day - occurring daily
Loose - not tightly secured                                    Further - promote or advance
Principal - administer or sum of money                         Lose - fail to win
                                                               Principle - basic law or truth

1.4 The writing
process

The previous sections have reviewed wording
choices, grammatical considerations and aspects of
academic voice that can help you craft a clear,
concise and correct document. But the idea of
writing can still intimidate many. A blank page can
cause people to stare and feel that sense of dread,
their mind emptying of any thoughts they had prior
to sitting down. I had one friend that would write
gibberish, typing random words on a blank page
until words started to form and the page filled with
real content. Even for experienced writers, a blank
page can be frightening. So how do you begin the
process? The below questions can help to guide
your thoughts before you begin to craft specific
content.

   Prior to content creation - At the onset of writing, it is
   helpful to ask a few questions:

             What is the goal of this document?
             What information is being communicated?
             Who is the audience receiving the communication?
             How will the information be transmitted?

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 19

Digital Media and
Technical Communications

In recognition of the changes in
technology over time, technical
communications nearly always involve
digital technologies. These can be as
commonplace as email or texting,
standard applications of the Google,
Microsoft or Apple operating systems,
team-based software like Microsoft
Teams and Zoom, or productivity
software like Slack. As with other
written and oral communications, the
use of these software must consider
factors such as: the objective of the
communication, the technology
limitations associated with each
software, the audience involved, and
potential digital security concerns.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 26
2.1 Digital tools to
assist technical
communications

It may be hard to imagine, but in my office, I have a
copy of a dissertation my grandfather wrote when
he completed his doctorate degree. Every word was
typed on a typewriter by my grandmother. Years
later, when my father completed his dissertation
for his doctorate degree, my mother typed it on a
word processor. His was the first dissertation from
his research lab at Purdue University to use a word
processor. Years later, when I wrote my
dissertation, I typed on a laptop that had cost
$2,000 and had less memory than my current
iPhone. As you write for this course, I imagine
many of you will write using convertible tablets
with styluses, and laptops with more storage than

increasing our productivity. As engineers, we
should embrace the technology that aids us in
becoming efficient in our tasks.

need to communicate the data in a visual form for
others to see the outcomes of their work. The
Microsoft Office Suite includes Excel, which can

generative AI.

Basic Guidelines for Generative AI use

The below principles should be followed when using generative AI in your field or study and practice.
       Generative AI must be cited - you cannot claim the work is your own original work if it was not authored by
            you and you alone. Just as you would cite another author, you must cite generative AI when it is used.
       You must check the output for correctness - Technical writing is expected to be clear, concise and correct. As
            the author you take responsibility for all contributing sources, including AI results. Look at each source and
            verify that it is a reputable source and worthy of inclusion in your work.
       From a course perspective, check your syllabus to ensure that you are using AI within the terms of your
            institution and your individual course.

                                                   This isn't always true, as scientist can also develop
                                                   new knowledge and engineers can also develop
                                                   explanation for phenomenon, however, in general
                                                   terms, scientist initiate the process of explaining
                                                   "what is" while engineers use that knowledge to
                                                   develop "what could be".

                                                   Inductive vs. Deductive

                                                   First, one must understand the difference between
                                                   inductive and deductive reasoning. In inductive
                                                   reasoning, one begins with an observation,
                                                   witnesses patterns aligning with the observations
                                                   and then develops a hypothesis which establishes a
                                                   broader theory. In deductive reasoning, one begins
                                                   with a theory, creates a testable hypothesis, gathers
                                                   data through observation and then confirms the
                                                   initial theory. Typically, engineers follow a
                                                   deductive process as many engineering solutions
                                                   are based on theoretical frameworks developed by
                                                   math and science. Oftentimes engineers will begin
                                                   with known relationships from math and physics
                                                   to leverage established principles for optimization
                                                   of physical systems. However, complex systems
                                                   cannot be explained completely by theoretical
                                                   frameworks. Actual data or historical models are
                                                   required to accurately predict and control
                                                   numerous factors for the optimal response.

Qualitative and
Quantitative Research

While both of these methods are valid methods of
rigorously understanding hypothesis, they are very
different and have distinctive approaches that can
even be mutually exclusive.

Qualitative Research

Like the root word "quality" implies, qualitative data explores subjective phenomena related to human subjects. This data
is typically descriptive in nature and is rarely able to be captured in numerical metrics. This research can include [6]:

       Phenomenology - the description of the lived experience
       Grounded Theory - a specified approach for theory development
       Ethnography - the exploration of a cultural group
       Historical - the exploration of a historical event or era
       Narrative inquiry - the exploration of an individual or several individuals
       Action research - the empowerment of a particular group, often marginalized by society, to change existing

            protocols, standards or preconceived notions
       Case Studies - an investigation into a particular group over a specific issue, situation or event, often conducted

            as a subset of a phenomenology or ethnography
       Field research - the documentation of groups or organizations or people in their field of practice

These are not the only categories for Qualitative Research, but these are the most popular forms of qualitative research
and most other categories are subsets of one of the types listed above.

It is important to note that engineers often need to conduct qualitative studies in conjunction with quantitative research.
Engineers working on a new process often test that process by forming pilot studies with individuals to execute the new
process and provide feedback. That is qualitative research. Engineers may require customers to test a new product and
provide feedback prior to releasing the product to market. This is also done with software and video games where "Beta
Testers" are provided an early release of a piece of software and give the developers feedback. The beta testers can
potentially find glitches or issues that need to be resolved prior to the full release. Their feedback is also a form of
qualitative research. Engineers conducting Six Sigma studies always involve end users, internal stakeholders and
customers to define the "Voice of the Customer" which impacts the approach to process and product improvement. This
part of the Define Stage in the Six Sigma DMAIC process is also a form of qualitative research.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 38
Quantitative Research

Unlike Qualitative Research, Quantitative Research focuses on measured data, rather than descriptive or narrative data.
This measured data can be gathered from human subjects (such as research investigating the correlation between resting
heart rate and the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease) but can also be gathered from non-human sources. An
old professor of mine called this "things and stuff". Things and stuff research can be anything from the fuel efficiency of a
car to the viscosity of a fluid to the orbit of a satellite to the failure rate of a bottling machine. In other words, nearly
everything can be measured in some way. These data points are the foundation of quantitative studies. To provide a more
formal definition, quantitative research is the systematic scientific investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena
and their relationships.
Just as Qualitative Research had several categories to serve as an initial framework to a research approach, Quantitative
Research also has three major categories:

       Descriptive - collecting data to determine the current state of a subject; a method of describing "what is"
       Correlational - a method for determining if a relationship between given variables exist. This method can help

            determine how variables impact each other in a predictable way. Note: this does not mean "Causality" - this is
            not concluding that one event causes another event to happen, but rather the change in one variable based on the
            state of another variable.
       Experimental - a method of determining a causal relationship, where you prove by manipulating one variable
            and measuring the impact on the other variable. Causality is difficult to prove conclusively, as it must hold true
            at all times and in all conditions. These relationships are often proved in scientific experiments and become the
            foundation of physics, kinematics, chemistry and other natural theoretical frameworks.
Each of these approaches requires the collection of data and some form of data analysis, which is typically a statistical
study. To ensure the data collection and analysis are valid, there are several fundamental qualities of quantitative research.

3.3 Understanding variables

Previously in the chapter we have discussed several scenarios where variables impact the outcome of the work. In fact, for
Quantitative Research, the very foundation of the research design begins with a question that can be answered by
collecting and analyzing data. The data measured corresponds to the variables involved in the study. There are some
variables which may be kept at a set level, while others we adjust in intentional ways to record the outcome. Based on the
use of the variable within the experiment, it could be classified as a constant, a control, an independent or a dependent
variable.

Constant, control,                                        Independent Variables - An independent

Understanding Error

Nuisance variables exist in nearly every experiment. In quality engineering terms, we talk about variation as having
common causes or special causes. A common cause is one that occurs naturally within a system and cannot be completely
eliminated. This means that every process has a particular goal, but tolerances are embedded account for these slight
variations that are continually impacting the system in little ways. Imagine a packaging line that is filling bags of Nacho
Cheese Doritos. The corn chips have been formed, fried, coated with seasoning and travel on a conveyor into the bag.
Sealed bags travel over a scale checking that the weight is within the given tolerance to make it acceptable to sell to a
customer [10]. While the manufacturing process runs incredibly fast and reliability, not every chip is exactly the same size
or weight and not every chip has the exact same amount of seasoning on them. Not every bag has the exact same number
of chips. In fact, not every bag weighs exactly the same, but they are all close the package stated weight of 1 ounce (for the
snack bag) or 9.25 ounces (for the larger bag) or any other packaging configuration. The manufacture sets the automatic
packaging line to separate packages that deviate too far from the goal weight, but there is a small range of acceptable
weight variance that will still be sent to customers. Could you really tell if your Dorito bag only had 9.15 ounces just by
looking at it? Or would you mind if your Dorito package had 10 ounces instead of 9.25? These slight variations are
accepted as part of the practice of manufacturing. So while a manufacturer will aim to eliminate as much error as possible,
it is understood that there will always be some amount of error. This is true in every engineering field, not just
manufacturing. However, to know how to interpret the validity of our data, we do need to recognize where error comes
from and how to quantify it.

Below are categories of error that can be expected in engineering systems and experiments.
       Environmental - This type of variation includes error from the context of the system or experiment. A student
            conducted an experiment where they were testing the accuracy of two different types of arrowheads. While the
            day was not terribly windy, the experiment took place outside and small wind currents could impact the
            outcome. Even in a laboratory setting, small variations in temperature, air current, humidity, sound, vibration or
            other environmental factors could impact an experimental outcome.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 45
 Instrumentation - Anytime measurements are being taken, one must consider the instrument used to collect the
      data. Several keep factors involve instrumentation and impact the validity of the experiment.
            o Resolution - As mentioned previously, is the measurement device the appropriate tool for the desired
                  level of precision for your data. If you are measuring something, the measurement device should be
                  able to measure to at least one greater level of precision. For example, if I am measuring something in
                  centimeters, the measurement device needs to have the ability to accurately measure millimeters, to
                  provide validity for my centimeter measurement.
            o Calibration - Every measurement tool should have the capability to be adjusted against a known
                  standard. Depending on the application, these known standards can be called standards or gauges.
                  These standards are established by various agencies, depending on the industry but many standards are
                  managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which set requirements for
                  measuring devices, standards, calibration requirements and practices for regular use, maintenance and
                  calibration [11]. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, the calibration of the scales weighing the
                  ingredients occurs on a monthly basis. To calibrate, the company brings weights of known values (1
                  gram or 10 kilograms or whatever is appropriate for the type of scale) and validates that the scale
                  weighs with the desired accuracy and precision. The act of calibrating a measuring device provides
                  validity of a measurement, knowing that the device is operating correctly against a known
                  measurement.
            o Zeroing - Measurement devices must be properly operated even after calibration. One key factor in
                  operation is that the device can be set at a true "0" location. That is, absent any materials, the
                  measurement device begins at zero. On digital devices, this is typically a setting or button that can be
                  pressed to return the starting value at zero. This ensures that the display reads the actual measurement
                  for the given object.

                                                 Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 46
 Operator Error - Even if your equipment is functioning correctly and the environmental conditions are
      controlled as possible, error can occur due to mistakes in operation.
            o Parallax - Parallax is the distortion of the reading due to distance between the point of measurement
                  and the measurement device. If you've ever driven by a speed check device on the highway at rush
                  hour, you will note that with multiple cars in multiple lanes traveling simultaneously at highway speed,
                  the display of speed does not always seem to align with your car. While the device might work well
                  aimed at one single vehicle, the general collection of data by being aimed at multiple lanes with cars
                  passing quickly makes it difficult for the device to correctly read each vehicle.
            o Lag time - Every human has a delayed response in recording the measurement due to the processing
                  time it takes to note the measurement and make the recording. If a person is trying to time the 100-
                  meter dash for the world's fastest person, even though they might stand right next to the finish line,
                  that means when the starting gun goes off, they must first hear the sound and then press the button to
                  start the stopwatch. When the person crosses the finish line, they must view the person crossing the
                  tape and press the button again. Each of these actions has a lag between the human senses noticing the
                  event and pressing the button on the device. Electronic sensors, vision systems, and other digital devices
                  (like RFID tags on the shoes of the runners) aid in increasing the accuracy of the measurement by
                  removing human responses and lag time.
            o Personal error - Sometimes people make mistakes. When it is noted that the operator has errored,
                  whenever possible, the trial should be repeated. If it cannot be repeated, that data point should not be
                  included in the results, as you know it is incorrect.

Without selecting the correct instrumentation, ensuring it is both calibrated and zeroed and operated correctly, the
readings for the data collection cannot be considered accurate measurements and the experimental results are no
longer valid.

Data Analysis and
Presentation of Data

This chapter presents basic principles of data analysis using fundamental statistical concepts with the support of
Microsoft Excel. While statistical analysis is a large area of study, requiring extensive quantitative analysis, the method of
presenting meaningful data in technical documents is consistent regardless of the complexity of the analysis being
conducted. As such, this section focuses on how to best present your data, as well as a review of several common tools for
data analysis in engineering fields.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 50

and analyzed, engineers can use the results to
answer critical questions in engineering design and
broader contexts in their field.

Descriptive statistics and their use

Descriptive statistics are a set of calculations that help one to understand a data set. Depending on your software, different
calculations can be included and the desired output can be customized to display the results most relevant to your
analysis. Prior to any hypothesis testing or the formation of confidence levels, these calculations can aid in a basic
understanding the data set.

       Sum - This is the addition of all data points.
       Count - This is the number of data points in the set.
       Arithmetic Mean - The mean of a data set is one of the most frequently used parameters for statistical analysis.

            For a single data set, this can be calculated by simply dividing the sum by the count. This is the same approach
            for calculating an average.
       Median - The median is the middle number when all data is arranged from minimum to maximum values.
       Mode - This is the number repeated the most frequently in the data set.
       Range - The range of the data is the difference between the maximum and minimum data point in a data set.
            This is the most basic measurement of dispersion of the data.
       Variance - This is a calculation of how far away each data point in the set is from the mean.
       Standard Deviation - This is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation was used in chapter 3 to
            calculate standard error. Standard error is often included in descriptive statistics.
       Quartiles - Quartiles represent the division of the data into four parts. The 2nd quartile is equal to the mean
            (which is the midpoint of the data or 50% of the data). The first quartile represents 25% of the data while the 3rd
            quartile represents 75% of the data.
Some data packages can include other calculations such as kurtosis and skewness, as well as confidence levels based on a
given percentage.

Example of Descriptive
Statistics

Descriptive statistics are very helpful in basic
understanding of a data set as a whole, rather than
individual data points. Imagine you take a test and
receive a score of 88%. This may or may not be a
good score relative to the rest of the course,
depending on the rest of the class. While this single
score can tell you that you received 88% of the
possible points, it does not give you any idea of
position within the class. Now imagine that your
professor posts the descriptive statistics for the
entire class and they provide the following
information:
Now your individual score of 88% is contextualized within the results of the entire class. Your result is just slightly higher
than the course average of 87.85. While the minimum score was 75%, there was at least one individual who received a
perfect score.
Looking at a box plot of this data you can see the 1st quartile is 83 and the 3rd quartile is 92.5. The median of 88 matches
your score, putting you right in the middle of the data for this exam.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 52
How does this help us better understand a single
data point or the set of data points? Your test score
is in the middle of all test scores. This tells you that
you performed similarly to your peers. For the
instructor, the test scores averaging around a high
B actually indicates that the test was probably too
easy.

For most data analysis, the descriptive statistics
help us to understand the characteristics of the data
set. Most complex analysis begins with these
measures.

4.2 Probability distributions

Probability distributions are sets of data that align to an established model of data with specific characteristics. Probability
distributions show the frequency of data in a theoretical model that aligns to established relationships that assist in
predicting how to model data according to its properties.
 Discrete Probability Distribution Mean and Variance

                  o Mean or Expected Value - For random discrete probability distributions the mean of the distribution
                        can be calculated by multiplying each individual sample by the function of the distribution.
                        Arithmetically this calculates the weighed average of possible values with weights equal to the
                        established probabilities.

                  o Variance - For a discrete random probability distribution, the variance measures the variability within
                        the distribution by calculating a weighted measure of each possible squared standard deviation with
                        weights equal to the probabilities.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 53
       Normal Distribution - The normal distribution is the most frequently used distribution in statistical analysis.
            Many hypothesis tests (such as using the Z or T table for hypothesis testing, conducting an Analysis of Variance
            (ANOVA) or conducting a linear regression, as well as others) begin stating that data must be random,
            independent and normally distributed. Normal data is symmetrical with respect to the mean and follows a bell-
            curve shape, as illustrated below.

Normal data follows the Measures of Central Tendency which state that in normally distributed data, the mean of the
data set will equal the median, which will equal the mode. In other words, the center of the data will also equal the central
number of the data set, which will also be the most frequent number within the data set.
The Normal Distribution is helpful because processes following a normal distribution have established probabilities, as
illustrated above. In normally distributed data, approximately 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation of
either side of the mean. Following this construction, 95% of the data will fall within two standard deviations and 99.7%
will fall within three standard deviations of either side of the mean. This information allows us to predict the behavior of
the entire population, based on a collected sample. Any normally distributed sample can be transformed to align with the
Z-table or T-table for easy calculations of probabilities of receiving a specific value, or being above or below a set value.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 54
Normal Distribution Example

From the data set used in the test score example, we can create a normal probability plot in Minitab and receive the
following output.

Based on the results, this data is normally distributed. You can tell because the points all fall close the centerline and are
within the bounds of the outer lines. The p-value is also greater than the established criteria for the p-value (0.05) which
also indicates a normal distribution. Using this information, we could test the probability of receiving a grade higher than
your 88% based on this sample being normally distributed. Using probability based on the data being normally
distributed, we can calculate that there is a 47% chance that a classmate received a higher grade than you.
While as an engineering student you should have at least one course dedicated to statistics, it is helpful to understand the
role of descriptive statistics to assess your sample in an appropriate way. It is also helpful to know that if your data is
normally distributed, you can evaluate your data using more sophisticated analytics to predict the behavior of data of the
population based on your sample.

4.3 Presenting Data

When presenting data, your goal should be to aid the reader in understanding the main point of your data analysis. Raw
data is rarely presented in technical documents, which is why the summarized information provided by descriptive
statistics is so helpful. The following sections hold true for tables, charts, images and figures. For simplicity, I will only use
the word graphical depiction or figure. Any figure included in your document should be referred to within the body of
your narration. In your narration, you can refer to it by number or name, but you want to place the figure in a way that
the reader does not have to search the document for the content. Whenever possible, include your initial narration about
the figure either directly above or below the referenced figure. If the figure is on a different page, it can be helpful to note
the page, for example, "see Figure 3 on page 2".

When creating the figures in Excel or other software applications, ensure you include all information that will help the
reader to understand what they are looking at when viewing the figure. For graphical depictions, you must include all
appropriate information including:

 A figure number and title - This chart             Series label - Most spreadsheet software
      number and title can be used in the Table           defaults to calling your data "Series 1".

                                                          chapter.

      the individual. Including brief                     the figure to be cluttered and hard to

                                                          who may be visually impaired. Some
                                                          colors are easier to see on a screen than

                                                          yellow or other lightly saturated colors).

Types of Figures

       Pie Chart Example - The figure to the right
            shows a data table next to a pie chart. Pie
            charts are helpful to demonstrate sections of
            a whole. While this figure isn't numbered or
            captioned, you see the title explains the
            intent of the figure. Each data series is
            labeled with both the numerical value and
            the title of the section. In this case, the table
            is redundant and could be removed.

       Pareto Chart with Cumulative Frequency
            Line - This is a bar chart with a cumulative
            distribution line overlaid on the right-hand
            axis. This provides an example of a 3-axis
            chart. When using a 3-axis chart, the left
            and right y-axis do not need to be identical,
            although they are in this example. As a
            Pareto chart is a frequency plot, with each
            bar showing the frequency of occurrence,
            this chart would be more helpful if the left-
            hand y-axis was the actual count of
            occurrences and the right-hand y-axis was
            the percentage of occurrence. The
            cumulative frequency line shows the
            cumulative percentages of occurrence as
            they are summed across the chart.

       Horizontal Multi-series Bar Chart - This
            bar chart illustrates a horizontal orientation
            of the data with the categories on the y-axis
            and the numerical values on the x-axis.
            Note that neither axis is labeled, which
            makes it difficult to understand what is
            being presented. With more than one series
            present, your chart should also include a
            legend which includes the color and
            description for each data set.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 57
Types of Figures

       Histogram - The histogram shows
            frequency data in pre-established bins of
            equal width. These bins group frequencies
            into specific ranges and are helpful in
            presenting ranges that align with categories
            or specific meanings. For example, if I was
            to make a histogram of grades, each bin
            would be created to represent a letter grade.

       Time Series Plots - Dot plots or line plots
            showing data trends over time can be very
            helpful for analyzing how data changes over
            time. This type of graph can be constructed
            for other quantifiable values, if it is not time
            based.

While spreadsheet software applications will
autosuggest chart types, focus on the main idea you
are hoping to convey to the reader when creating your
figure. If you are comparing data to a standard, it can
be helpful to add a visual reference point. The
presentation of data should help the reader better
understand your analysis.

4.4 Conclusion

 This chapter focused on the presentation of data in technical reports. While not all documents will include data, a large
 percentage of technical and engineering documents include a visualization of data in some form. When presenting data,
 you want to consider what visual could best aid the reader in understanding the content as a whole. You should also
 consider the audience, how the document will be presented (printed, online, email attachment) as well as accessibility
 features for those individuals who might be vision impaired. With these considerations in mind, your presentation of
 data can help support your narrative, allowing your reader to arrive at the same conclusion you present in your
 document.

Up Next

 In the next chapter we will introduce common engineering documents, including memos, executive summaries and
 white papers. These documents are typically brief and often prepared for internal audiences. Each of the documents
 will be presented with the objectives, key features and examples of these in practice.

5.1 Memos

Memos (or Memorandums, which is the full title of the document, although rarely used) are formal documents, oriented
towards internal audiences that can include broad audiences. These documents are typically brief (only a page or two)
and have a very narrow focus. While brief, memos can communicate very important information, including changes to
policy, operational procedures or announcements about changes within a company. Prior to the digital era, memos were
often printed, distributed to individuals and/or posted in common areas for all to read. In today's industry setting, memos
are often disseminated through email and posted to internal websites, although important policy changes may still be
printed and posted in common areas. While brief, memos are formal documents and can be a challenge to write, as they
often reflect policy or changes to broad audiences.
Similar to other company specific documents, the format is of a memo often follows a specific template, used
department-wide or even company-wide. The contents are dependent on the type of memo being authored. For
engineering related memos, the format is typically notifying the audience of changes to a product, process or policy.
Therefore, the general format can be captured with the following sections:

Example Memo

Example Header

Below is the header of a sample memo. In this format, the memo includes To, From, Date, and Subject, as well as a
salutation, typical of a letter or email.

Example Introduction or Purpose Paragraph

Following the header, the first paragraph provides context for the memo and the background that has led to the decision
being presented in the document.

Example Discussion Paragraph

Now that the audience understands why the memo is being written, the author can include the relevant information for
how the decision was made. In this case, the author provides a case for lost productivity and the actions that must take
place to correct this action.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 61
  Example Actions or Recommendations

  The new procedure is provided with details of how the procedure should be implemented and the expected outcome.

Example Closing

After presenting the new policy, this closing emphasizes the desired outcome and includes a formal closing. For this
memo, both a traditional salutation and formal closing were used. If you choose to use a salutation for a greeting at the
beginning of the memo, a formal closing should be included for consistency. If no salutation is used in the header, a formal
closing is not required. Even without a formal closing, every memo should have a concluding paragraph.

  There are some engineering documents, like Engineering Change Notifications, that follow a very similar style to memos,
  but are given specific titles based on their function and purpose. These titles and formats will often change based on your
  engineering discipline, the type of company you work for and industry standards.

                                                            Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 62
5.2 Executive Summaries

Executive Summaries are standalone documents typically based on the content of a full technical report. Executive
Summaries contain identical sections to a full technical report but are abbreviated to present only the most critical
information in a brief format. As a rule of thumb, Executive Summaries are often just a few pages or roughly 10% of the
original document. For example, the Executive Summary to some government reports can be more than 20 pages, but are
still less than ten percent of the original document.
As its name implies, an executive summary often is aimed at an executive audience, or those who are at the highest
managerial levels within a company. While the topic may be technical in nature, the audience often comes from a non-
technical background, like business management. Chapter 7 will present in detail the sections of a full report. As these
sections are identical to an Executive Summary, this content will serve as an introduction not only to writing executive
summaries but to authoring technical reports.

Front Matter

In the case of longer executive summaries, like
those from government agencies, a Cover Page,
Table of Contents or other form of Index may be
required. The front matter should include
whatever the provided format includes. If no
format is provided, a Table of Contents is typically
helpful for documents that exceed 5 or 6 pages.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 63
Introduction

For an Executive Summary, the Introduction section can look nearly identical to the Introduction of the full report,
depending on the desired length of the document. For an Executive Summary the Introduction includes a brief overview
of each section included in the document. These sections would typically include either background or relevant context,
the methodology, data analysis and results.

Like any other technical document, the Introduction should introduce the reader to the purpose of the activities described
and to the purpose of the document. The reader should clearly understand why the activities were performed and the
expected outcome. This includes information about the context or background that brought about the engineering
activities. For example, if you completed a study for a new supplier of raw materials due to supply chain delays post-
COVID 19, you would briefly described the materials being sought and the delays experienced and the impact of the
delays on operations.

You also need to introduce the scope of the document so the reader knows what to pay close attention to. Even with an
abbreviated format, you should highlight areas of the methodology and data analysis, as well as key results of
implications to help guide the reader through your document.

Methodology

Your methodology will not reflect a step-by-step procedure when writing an Executive Summary. The methodology
should be clear, concise and correct. To accomplish this for the methodology section, your focus should be on "what" and
"why". To describe what you did, focus on specific context or setting and techniques used for execution of your
experiment. To address why you selected this specific method, state how the methodology impacted the accuracy and
precision of your data collection, contributing to the overall validity of the work performed. You should also include any
limitations to your methods, which could be factors of nuisance variables as discussed in chapter 3, or limitations to your
study.

Compared to full technical reports, the methodology is frequently the section most reduced from the original document.
This is because the details provided in the methodology are rarely as important as the results and implications to the
executive audience. When considering your audience, their focus is often on the result or decisions or implications or next
steps required. Therefore, the methodology only needs to convey basic information that confirms that the appropriate
methods were used support the outcome.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 64
                  Presentation of Data

                  The presentation of data should be a combination
                  of both narrative and images that aid in the
                  reader's comprehension of your conclusions. Raw
                  data is not necessary for this to occur. Instead,
                  critical data should be summarized and presented
                  in clearly labeled tables. Graphical representations
                  help to more clearly communicate the key
                  attributes of the data and should complement the
                  narrative presented in the document. These
                  methods were described in detail in the previous
                  chapter.

Analysis of Data

For data analysis, the author should use the graphical presentations of data to support the analysis and conclusions. The
reader should be able to review the graphs or charts and draw the same conclusions that the narrative provides.
It should also be clear how the data supports the overall objectives of the work and whether or not the hypothesis was
confirmed, when applicable. In the earlier example about determining a new supplier for a company, the data presented
should support the decision of which supplier was chosen. If the reader views the data and comes to a different
conclusion, the document has not clearly connected the data to the analysis and conclusions. If there were factors that
could cause confusion or negatively impact the experiment, those should be clearly stated and support should be provided
on how these factors were mitigated or no longer impact the results.

Conclusion

The Conclusion of an executive summary is the last opportunity you have to persuade your audience of your conclusion.
In a single section, or sometimes even a single paragraph, the conclusion should remind the reader of the overall objective
of the work performed, the key data analysis that supports the recommendations or conclusions and the next steps
required either by the author or the reader.

In the Conclusion, you may also want to highlight opportunities to apply this work in a broader context or make
recommendations for future work. These extensions of your work may be outside the scope of the original work but
could be important to the company in the future. From the previous example, this could be notifying the readers that the
new supplier selected offers additional materials or supplies that the company could use for other projects or in other
divisions of the company. This recommendation does not directly relate to the initial scope of your project but is valuable
to note to the reader.

5.3 Case Studies

Case studies are the brief reporting of a singular focus, similar to executive summaries but with an audience that is
typically either external customers or peers of your discipline or industry. This form of reporting allows individuals to
quickly disseminate information about innovations, new products or processes or new areas of exploration. The work is
often published internally, hosted on the company website and therefore does not go through a peer review process like an
externally published document.

The case study audience is often most interested in the results of the work, so the format may only include a brief overview
with a stated objective and short description of the methods used and context for the activities performed. The majority of
the document focuses on the results and implications. Depending on what is being presented and if the intended audience
is a potential customer or peers in industry, the document may conclude with recommendations for future work or
broader extensions of the results.

Above is a sample case study, published on the website of an engineering firm. A link to this document is provided in the
references section for further review if desired [1].

                 5.4 Conclusion

                                               This chapter introduced common documents in
                                               engineering industries, including memos, executive
                                               summaries and case studies. While short in length,
                                               these documents must maintain the technical
                                               writing foundational principles of being clear,
                                               concise and correct. Using the methods for writing
                                               in a professional voice, crafting sections of
                                               technical papers and presenting data, you can
                                               successfully author engineering documents.

                       Up Next

                                               In the next chapter, additional brief engineering
                                               documents will be presented, including Standard
                                               Operating Procedures, white papers and
                                               engineering process documents. These brief
                                               documents are also typically prepared in specified
                                               formats to internal stakeholders.

Chapter 06

Additional Brief Technical
Documents

In the last chapter, several forms of documents were introduced that are common to engineering professions. This chapter
continues with several additional types of documents found in engineering fields. In this chapter we will discuss standard
operating procedures (also called work instructions or job instructions) which are often written by engineering interns or
newly hired engineers. These are one form of process documentation. Several other forms of process documents will be
reviewed. Finally, we will discuss the use of white papers in engineering and industry publications.

                                                          Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 68
6.1 Standard Operating Procedures/ Work
Instructions

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) or Work Instructions can be called by various terms in different industries or
companies. Job Instructions is probably the third most common term used for this document, after SOP or Work
Instruction. The rest of this section will refer only to SOPs, but the concepts hold true for any of these types of documents,
even if they are called by a different name.
SOPs are designed to communicate procedures in a step-by-step way to be executed by the operators who perform the
task. At many industry settings, these procedures are documented by a supervisor, engineering intern or entry-level
engineer, even though the work is conducted by other employees. This means that the person writing the document has to
gain familiarity with the process prior to authoring the document. It also means that the document should be validated
against the work being performed prior to publishing or approving the final version of the document.
As the intended audience for this document is often an hourly-paid employee, you must make sure the steps are written at
the appropriate educational level for the intended operator. There are highly technical SOPs written where the operators
are highly educated individuals completing very technical processes. More often, SOPs are written for individuals who
have limited higher education or may not have completed high school. Prior to beginning to author an SOP, it is
important to know the language level of the audience. It is also possible that the intended audience does not speak English
as their native language. In some cases, SOPs are translated into other languages to enhance comprehension of the
operators. When this occurs, it is critical that the translated document is verified by someone who speaks both languages,
to ensure that the translation is correct. Some technical terms do not have a word-for-word translation and require
adjusting the language to communicate the appropriate concept.
SOPs frequently have a template specific to the company and these templates are standardized so that operators have
familiarity with the documents even when learning a new technique, process or piece of equipment. In highly regulated
companies, the format may be specified from the regulating body, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 69
You may ask yourself, why does everyone have to do things the same way? Prior to the Industrial Revolution in the
1800's, all manufacturing was single piece construction with each craftsmen building each item to order. After the
Industrial Revolution, concepts around standard work were presented by the individuals who would become the pioneers
of the field of Industrial Engineering [1]. In the early 1900's formal SOPs began to appear in various industries to ensure
that tasks were easily repeated in the exact same way every time. During World War II, with the sudden need to increase
production rates, standard operating procedures became common place in all sorts of industries, supported through the
standardization of military documents following American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements. Additional
governing agencies proliferate the use of standard documents to adhere to the requirements of the industry regulating
bodies. Standards not only allowed for process control, but also led to an increase in productivity and quality. SOPs also
serve as a mechanism for training individuals on the correct procedure, to ensure all operators new to a task complete it in
the same way. SOPs also create a process flow that can be analyzed for improvement. With the advent of ISO, industries
of all kinds adopted the use of SOPs including healthcare, finance, service industries, telecommunication, aviation and
internet-based processes.
To create an SOP you want to identify the process steps, the equipment used, the safety requirements and any prerequisite
training that should be completed prior to an operator conducting this process. You should also consider equipment or
process set-up that should be verified prior to beginning the procedure and any personal protective equipment (PPE) that
is required or recommended. Elements that must be documented in some way should also be noted with importance.

SOP Example 1 Header

Using whatever template your company provides, you will typically have a name for the SOP. It may also include a
numbering convention, revision date and author. Example 2 highlights these fields.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 70
SOP Example 1 Procedure

The procedure should be numbered in the order the tasks should be performed. Photos and diagrams should be used
whenever possible to aid the operator in validating that they have completed the tasks correctly.

SOP Example 1 Embedded Safety Notes

As seen in step 11 below, the procedure should note areas when there are task specific safety concerns.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 71
SOP Example 1 Procedure Verification Notes

As seen in step 13 below, this procedure provides specific setting requirements and provides an opportunity for the
individual to verify that their settings match the requirements of the procedure

SOP Example 2

The below example shows a template that can aid the author in creating content for each of the required areas [2].

6.2 White Papers

White papers are similar to journal articles in composition and format, but are typically written as corporate documents
on technical topics that may be of interest to a broad technical audience. Like case studies, these documents are frequently
published to company websites, although they can also be published privately on individual websites or blogs. With these
publishing methods, an official peer review is rarely conducted.
The contents of a white paper can resemble journal articles or technical reports, but they do not necessarily follow a
specified format, depending on the company and the intended audience. Some companies have their technical personnel
author white papers on topics that may interest their customers about changes in the industry or new developments in
technology, products or processes. These documents are often written with fellow engineers or business-to-business
customers in mind. Therefore, the content focuses on descriptions of the systems and results to positively highlight
opportunities or advances within the company's capabilities.
White papers are also used in the scientific community to self-publish research that has been conducted to solicit
feedback from other researchers in their discipline. Specific websites have been created for peers to share their research
internationally. This feedback helps researchers to learn who else is working in that same area of research or receive
feedback prior to completing the peer review process for being published in a journal. As publishing in a journal can take
anywhere from 18 - 24 months, this self-publication method advances research more quickly.
Examples of several different paper are available using the links from the images below [3, 4, 5].

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 73
6.3 Process Documents and Quality
Documents

In industry, companies often have additional documents for specific purposes that you will interact with as an
engineering. Depending on your engineering discipline, industry and position within the company, you may find yourself
generating many different types of documents. Each of these documents continue to follow the goals of all technical
writing: to be clear, concise and correct. Each document may have a different target audience, objective and format, but
the same techniques discussed in the previous chapters remain critical to completing a document that meets your given
objective.
Technical documents of this type often communicate information about processes, standards or products. These internal
documents are typically controlled within the institution to ensure that only the latest revision is the only document in use.
The documents can include information about test results, validation efforts, internal quality audits, project
documentation and engineering change notifications. The content will vary for each of these different documents.

Six Sigma Documents

Six Sigma or Lean Six Sigma is a common process improvement strategy used in various industries to reduce variation
within a process to increase revenues, decrease cost, increase quality or better meet customer requirements. Below is a
sample template for a Six Sigma Charter [6].

                                                        Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 74
Engineering Change Notification

Engineering Change Notifications (ECNs) are documents that track changes to materials, technical drawings, process
specifications, supplier requirements and other process specific information. These documents typically follow a company
specific template and are tracked using an alpha-numeric system to ensure all revisions are approved and implemented as
required. The below sample demonstrates a template that can be used [7].

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 75
Quality Audits

Internal quality audits are routinely conducted to ensure companies remain in compliance with their own policies and
with regulatory specifications. Quality audits are often conducted at regular intervals by a quality engineer or technician
internal to the company but outside the department to ensure objective observations are made. Documentation of
findings is often used for process improvement or training initiatives. Internal quality audits can aid in maintaining a state
of compliance in between inspections from external regulatory bodies. The below sample provides an example of one type
of quality audit [8].

6.4 Conclusion

This chapter reviewed additional brief engineering documents, including Standard Operating Procedures, white papers
and various types of process documents. Each of these documents is highly dependent on the industry and company for
their format and required content. However, there are several content areas consistent across most companies for these
type of documents.

Up Next

In the next chapter, longer engineering documents, including full technical report, proposals and grants will be discussed.
While these documents can feel intimidating due to their length, the content and writing process follow the same
conventions discussed in the previous chapters of this text.

7.2 Technical Report Sections

Technical reports aim to communicate the complete information from beginning to end of a project, process, or research
activity. These documents are written in an academic voice and must accurately describe the methods, data analysis and
conclusions from the activity performed. While an executive summary can accomplish this task in an abbreviated method,
technical reports will provide thorough descriptions of every step of the process, rather than summarizing the content in a
more concise way.

Abstracts

An abstract is a brief (250 - 500 word) summary of your entire work. Unlike an executive summary which maintains the
same sections as the report itself, an abstract is typically presented in a single paragraph. Abstracts are often published in
journals, poster presentations, oral presentations, conference proceedings and databases to provide readers and
opportunity to have a better idea of the content of an article than simply looking at the title.
As the abstract summarizes the entire paper, you should ensure that you provide brief descriptions about the motivation
for the work, the type of methodology used, the approach to the data analysis and the results. Below is an abstract from a
published paper which was required to use a specified format for the journal [1].

Abstract
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how to use Six Sigma to improve the service process in higher education.
Design/Methodologies/Approach: This article summarized the previous literature to illustrate the differences between
service and manufacturing process from the lens of Six Sigma, and used a practical case study from higher education to
explain how to implement the framework of DMAIC in service process and the challenges occurred during
implementation.
Findings: We described a case study where Lean Six Sigma (LSS) principles were adapted at the Purdue Sponsored
Program Services (SPS) Pre-Award office, which is dedicated to supporting the creation of quality proposals and
contracts for staff at Purdue. We described how a LSS team worked with the team to apply DMAIC in their service
process, defining potential benefits such as reduced service lead-time, lower work-in-process inventory and
improvement on imbalanced workflow. This case study demonstrates the numerous challenges in working with the
intangible factors that hard to recognize, quantify, and analyze.
Practical Implications: It is important for practitioners to be aware of the implementation of Six Sigma in service industry,
because service operations comprise 80% of the GDP in United States. The nature of service project decides the
complexity to identify what to improve, and methodology. The article provides suggestions on how LSS tools and
principles can be applied while running projects in a service environment.
Originality: Six Sigma has been widely used in manufacturing, but there has been limited academic research about the
implementation in service industry, particular to higher education. This article contributes through demonstration the
value of the DMAIC methodology in service process and identifies challenges for higher education.
Keywords: Six Sigma, DMAIC, Service, Higher Education

Abstract
This paper is for ongoing work in developing unique collaborations between engineering and non-engineering students in
a user-centered design course and humanitarian engineering project work. In this paper, the authors will review their
integration of social and emotional competencies into engineering design and practice through a credit-based engineering
course in conjunction with an Engineers in Action (EIA) Bridge Project student chapter at a midwestern public university.
Previous research has shown that many universities have limited engagement with topics of multicultural engagement,
working within diverse interdisciplinary teams, and approaching engineering problems from an awareness of inclusivity,
cultural sensitivity and socioeconomic factors, despite the value placed on these qualities by accrediting bodies like ABET
and societies like the National Society of Professional Engineers and the National Academy of Engineers. This content is
often seen as a single module embedded in general engineering coursework, even though studies have shown students are
often eager to connect global and societal concerns with engineering. A small number of engineering educational
institutions in the United States have integrated these competencies more broadly into humanitarian or service engineering
programs, but these programs are separate from traditional engineering majors such as mechanical or civil engineering.
This project evaluates the professional formation of engineers by examining how engineers apply social attributes (namely
those identified by the Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) framework) to user-centered design in a multidisciplinary
project. This is facilitated by asking two research questions: "What key social attributes do undergraduate students
identify as significant factors within service-learning engineering projects?" and "How does participating in a user-
centered design curriculum impact students' identification of key social attributes associated with service-learning
projects?". As part of an NSF proposal, this work is conducted through a multi-year grant that supports the development
of the curriculum, as well as the assessment of the student participants. This presentation will review the theoretical
framework used for the curriculum and mixed-methods research, as well as present the process of obtaining grant
funding for this collaborative effort. The creation of the multidisciplinary advisory board and the program mechanisms
for blending engineering and non-engineering students will also be discussed.

Front Matter

Dependent on the requirements provided, the front matter could include the Table of Contents, Table of Tables and/or
Table of Figures, Acknowledgements and any other content that is required prior to the presentation of the technical
work. This is highly varied content, with requirements changing by target audience, publication type, discipline, industry
and company. As an author, it is your responsibility to complete the required sections as specified by the template.

Introduction

The Introduction is the first content of the technical paper and serves to orient the reader to the purpose of the work and
the purpose of the technical report.

      Importance and relevance of the work - The introduction should give the reader some context into the
            motivation behind the work being conducted. In a purely research oriented paper, this could include your initial
            research question and hypothesis. For industry work, this could include the motivating situation for the project,
            such as looking to optimize a process or reduce costs. The reader will use this information as a foundation to
            their review of the content that follows. This introduction allows you to set the tone and guide the reader in
            what is most important about the work you conducted.

      Scope of the report - The second part of the introduction is to orient the reader to the report itself. You should
            inform the reader what important contents will follow and what they should pay special attention to as they
            read. For example, you may want to mention the methodology, highlighting an innovation practice or your
            method for ensuring rigor and internal validity. For the data section, you may want to briefly describe your
            sampling plan or context for data collection. For the data analysis you might mention your confidence level or
            statistical test.

The introduction will support the rest of the paper by preparing the reader to notice the most important aspects of your
work and how this related to your topic for discussion. A well written introduction can help guide your writing in the
following sections as well.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 81
 Methodology

  In chapter 3, when discussing variables, it was stated that the methodology is critical to ensuring that your results
  appropriately align to your research goals and provide results that can be applied to greater contexts as applicable. When
  writing your methodology section, you need to present this intentionality (or purposefulness) to provide your readers
  with not just what you did, but why and how. It is also important to note that in some cases your methodology would be
  detailed enough that another person could replicate your work. As mentioned previously, there are some applied
  researchers who test the theoretical work of others to see if the mathematical proofs can actually be proven in a physical
  manner. However, not all methodologies need to be this exhaustive. Knowing your audience, the expectations of the
  publishing body (internal, external, or journal and the purpose of your paper should guide how detailed you are when
  documenting your process. Regardless of level of detail, every methodology should address the following questions in
  some way:

        How does your methodology increase the validity of your experiment through robust design and rigorous
              research methods?

        How does your methodology support your question/problem/objective?
        How does your methodology impact your data collection?
        What were limitations to your execution?

Presentation of Data

Chapter 4 of this text was focused on how to use the presentation of data effectively to communicate your results and the
implications of your work to various types of audience. As introduced in chapter 1, your technical writing is highly
influenced by your audience and by the goal of the document. If I am writing a technical report to other engineers to
document my process improvement project, my data should focus on the impact of the work. If I am writing a report for a
Lean Six Sigma project to executive management, I would follow the standard DMAIC format and the data would be
spread throughout the document, as each of the five sections include some presentation of data. This is to say, your
presentation of data is dependent on the experiment you conducted, the type of data collected and the type of document
being written. With that in mind, there are several items that are expected in most presentations of data.

      Relevant formulas and established constants - In chapter 3, it was noted that constants are those values already
            established, typically from the natural world like viscosity of a fluid, or documented standards, like friction
            forces for known materials or established values, like the gravitational constant. While not every formula used in
            a process is required, if there is a formula that you have derived in a specific way for your work or a formula
            which was foundational to all other calculations, they should be presented.

      Sample size, composition and method - To ensure that your data adequately represents the population
            discussed, the size of the sample, the sampling method (like random sampling, convenience sampling, or
            stratified sampling) and important characteristics of your sample should be documented. If I was looking at a
            correlation between Hellenistic society membership (like fraternities and sororities) and cumulative GPA, I
            would want to document the number of individuals in each particular group and how they were selected for the
            study. This could include subgroupings by their academic major, their year in school or other demographic
            factors that could impact the study. Each of these items could influence the results of the study, therefore it is
            critical to provide the reader with context to the data analysis.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 82
      Descriptive statistics - As presented in chapter 4 - the descriptive statistics are the most basic description of the
            data set or sets being considered. Knowing the mean, median, mode, standard deviation and standard error all
            provide an idea of the characteristics of the data.

      Probability distribution and hypothesis testing - Once the descriptive statistics are established, documenting
            additional statistical testing, such as hypothesis testing should be presented. As data needs to be tested in
            accordance with the appropriate probability distribution, establishing normality or documenting which
            distribution is being used should be clearly stated to the reader.

      Graphical summaries and displays - When presenting the data, it is rare that all raw data would be provided to
            the reader. Often the raw data takes up a great deal of space and isn't helpful. Summary tables of the descriptive
            statistics and graphical displays of the probability distribution aid the reader in seeing how your data fits with
            the theoretical distribution.

Analysis of Data

Depending on the format provided, the presentation of data and analysis can be combined into a single section.
Sometimes the two sections are separated to have the data analysis as a singular focus for the reader. When no
specification is provided, the author should consider the focus of the work. If the work is focused on documenting a
methodology and the resulting data, it might be helpful to split each section. When the focus is on actions from the
analysis (such as a process change to improve quality or decrease cost) the data analysis may be combined with the
presentation of data to make the data section more concise. In either case, the data analysis should focus on three key
areas:

      Your data analysis should draw connections between the results and your overall objective for the study. First
            and foremost, your data should answer the question you posed in the introduction of the work. If for some
            reason your experiment did not adequately answer the question, an explanation should be provided as to why
            this is the case or what other information is needed to answer the question.

      Your data analysis should be compared to your hypothesis or expected outcome or established benchmarks for
            your field. This is not necessarily the same as the previous bullet point. For example, you may have completed a
            project that was conducted to establish if a new motor, which was less expensive and more readily available,
            could substitute the existing part being used. Your initial hypothesis was that the new motor worked similarly
            and could make the substitution without sacrificing overall performance. However, after testing, you saw that
            there was a statistically significant difference between the old motor and the new motor. The new motor would
            not be able to be used without a significant loss of performance. Your work answered the question - could a
            new, cheaper moto be used. The answer did not align to your initial hypothesis, however, meaning that the
            overall objective of saving time and money will not be accomplished with this particular change.

      If your work has proven successful, the next step is to determine the appropriate application of the results. This
            extension of your results is the true impact of the work performed. It could be a small local change that only
            applies in a limited setting or it could be a larger impact with implications for the company or for your
            engineering discipline as a whole.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 83
Conclusions

The conclusion is the bookend to the introduction of your technical report. Similar to the introduction, your conclusion
should summarize the full report highlighting the accomplishments of the work. Any potential areas of expansion or
replication should be restated, along with recommendations for future work. This is also an opportunity to reiterate
broader applications for the work.
A conclusion is the last content your reader will remember. A well written conclusion can aid the reader in connecting the
most important aspects of your work to the intended outcome. If your report is to an executive requesting funding for a
follow-up project, your conclusion should leave the executive with confidence that your recommendations should be
followed. If you are reporting on work completed, your conclusion should ensure that the reader appreciates the value of
the work completed and impact of your efforts. If your work discovered a new process or potential for a new product, the
conclusion should have the reader considering how this new process or product could be integrated with existing systems.
Much like oral presentations presented in chapter 8, the conclusion of the paper should have the reader understand what
is expected of them. The conclusion should clearly identify the next steps for this field of study, project or proposal.

7.3 Proposals and
Bids

Proposals and bids are project specific documents
prepared for external entities to either:

      Request others to bid on work your
            company needs completed

      Reply to a request for work you can
            complete for someone else's needs.

Content for proposals and bids

While the exact content should align to the requirements of the requisitioning entity, these documents typically include a
scope of work, a timeline for completion, the anticipated budget or funding allotted and the contractual terms for
completion or termination of the contract. Several examples of contracts and bids are provided to show how these
documents may be formatted.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 84
Example 1 - This request for proposal (RFP)
provides for summary information about the
company and the bid [3]. A purpose for the work is
provided and space is allotted for the bidding
company to identify their scope and description of
work. Note that this is a cover page and additional
content, such as the schedule and budget, could be
included on subsequent pages.

Example 2 - The second example shows a bid that
has been completed for a request and provides the
description, project objectives and expected
timeline [4].

7.4 Goals of Grant Proposals

Grants are a specific type of proposal in which funding is provided by the granting agency (typically a government or
charitable foundation) to complete a project or research in a focus area. For example, the National Institute of Health
(NIH) provides funding for scientists to research methods and medicines for treating deadly and debilitating diseases. The
Department of Labor issues grants for training programs in emerging technologies or to retrain workers in fields that are
facing workforce reductions.
Granting agencies create templates for submissions and often require annual reports to update the agency on the spending
of the funds and the results of the work each year. These interim reports, as well as the work at the conclusion of the
project, also follow specified templates. These templates often include the sections from the beginning of this chapter and
potentially additional sections specific to the type of work being conducted. The requests for proposals outline the scope
of work, the required timeline, the funding provided, limitations to who can apply and any other important factors the
applicant should consider while creating a bid. An example of a grant solicitation is below [6].

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 86
7.5 Conclusion

This chapter focused on full length technical
reports including a general format for technical
reports which could also be used for journal
articles as well as proposals and bids for working
with external entities. The chapter also discussed a
specific form of proposal, namely, grant proposals.
Each of these documents is a formal written
document and can include both internal and
external audiences. This chapter used concepts
described in the previous sections for crafting a
clear, concise, correct document in an engineering,
professional voice.

Up Next

The next chapter will examine oral presentations
of technical content for both formal and informal
settings. Many of the same preparation steps for
crafting a technical report are echoed when
creating an oral presentation. Various types of
presentations will be discussed, with the difference
of audiences, settings and length considered.

Chapter 08

Technical Presentations

This chapter reviews technical presentations for formal and informal audiences. This chapter addresses the need
to consider the audience with respect to the technical content being presented as well as the nature of the
presentation type. Key fundamentals for presentational speaking with technical subjects are reviewed as well as
how presentations may vary based on the setting, audience and desired outcome.

greatly based on the audience. However, there is a   8. Summarize
process which can be followed for any type of

listed on the right and then expanded on
individually.

                                              These steps may look different or be emphasized
                                              differently for each of the following types of
                                              technical presentations, but this process will
                                              provide a solid foundation for preparing your
                                              work to be displayed and discussed.

                                         Assess Your Audience

                                                                                  You must analyze your audience thoroughly before
                                                                                  a technical presentation. Who your audience is
                                                                                  dictates how you deliver your information. Before
                                                                                  you begin to create presentational content, ask
                                                                                  yourself the following questions:

1. Who will be there? Is this an audience that has voluntarily chosen to hear you speak about the given topic or is
      the presentation required? An audience that has self-selected to attend your presentation often has their own
      motivating interests to listen to the content and can bring a higher level of engagement that those that have been
      forced to attend. For example, when you are invited to present a proposal to a potential customer, the
      individuals are wanting to hear how your information can inform a decision they need to make - should they
      buy your product or hire your firm or accept your bid. If you are doing mandatory training for employees on a
      new procedure, sometimes employees need to focus on the information to better understand the process they
      need to follow. However, some trainings may be required to meet regulatory compliance or meet internal
      compliance standards. In those cases, employees may resent that their time is being spent listening to your
      presentation rather than doing other tasks. At academic conferences, often times there will be concurrent
      sessions to choose from, implying that your audience has chosen your presentation based on their interest in the
      subject matter. This often is accompanied by a higher understanding of the content being presented. As these
      examples illustrate, simply considering the attendees can give additional insight into how you would organize
      and craft your presentation. These points will be further addressed in the subsequent sections.

2. Why will they be there? Much like the question of "who", why someone will attend your presentation can
      provide insight into how much prior knowledge, experience, interest and internal motivation each audience
      member brings to your presentation.

3. What will they know already? Knowing who will be in your audience and why they are attending gives you an
      opportunity in advance to assess prior knowledge of the audience. Building on our previous examples, when
      preparing a bid for a potential client, they are already very familiar with their own needs. However, they do not
      know how your company can leverage their resources to meet those needs in an efficient and cost effective
      manner. When training employees a technique necessary to do a new task, they may not have any previous
      knowledge on this new process, product, equipment or technique. You may need to start with the most basic
      information to provide context before executing the training. For compliance related training, you may be
      presenting information they have previously heard, which can cause them to have lots of previous information
      but very low motivation to engage with your content or presence. In academic sessions, where an audience has
      selected to attend your session, there is an implication of personal or professional interest in your topic which
      often includes some knowledge of the topic as well.

                                                 Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 90
4. What will they be unfamiliar with? In contrast to their existing knowledge, it's helpful to think of your own
      presentation in terms of what is unique, new or interesting. For the previous examples, a company often wants
      to highlight what separates them from the competition, so you would not only be presenting what you can do,
      but what your company offers than other competitions might not. This persuasive element adds reasons for a
      potential customer to select you over other alternatives. For training, it is helpful to point out functions or
      elements of the training that could be surprising to your audience. This is especially true in mandatory training
      where employees may not feel much internal motivation to pay attention. For academic sessions, highlighting
      your focal area can help distinguish how your work differs from others. Your audience may have some
      familiarity with the general content, but not the same depth in your subject matter expertise. It is helpful to
      consider what they will know and what they may not know to better streamline your presentation. Many
      presentations have to be completed in a specific amount of time, making it necessary to keep your content brief
      where possible.

5. What will they find compelling (ie: data, methodology, narrative)? As each of the previous question is
      answered, you are creating an outline in your mind about where your focus should be to be the most effective
      presentation for your given audience. By understanding what the audience will find compelling, you can help
      engage your audience by teasing that content from the very beginning of the presentation or recalling it at other
      places within the content to keep the most important information in the forefront of your audience's mind.

6. What do I want them to do with the information they are given? While the "ask" may seem a fairly intuitive
      process, it is helpful to clearly understand in your own mind the desired outcome prior to beginning the
      construction of your content. For example, if you are doing a proposal for a customer, consider where you are
      within the decision process. If the potential customer or client is seeing a series of multiple presentations over the
      space of several days, you may not receive confirmation of their selection at the end of your presentation. As
      such, your presentation should not end requesting that a decision be made. Rather, you would want to end with
      the potential customer confident in your abilities and clearly understanding how to contact you if they desire
      additional information or to proceed with your services. In a training session, you may want to end with some
      method of confirming that the audience has correctly understood the main ideas. This could involve a series of
      questions to answer using technology such as Quizlet or Kahoot, or having individuals raise their hands to
      answers questions out loud or even just consider the question in their own heads. For an academic presentation,
      it may be more critical to understand the results of your work and the next steps.

                       Garner their attention

                                              You may have been told to open a speech with a
                                              joke to get your audience's attention. While jokes
                                              are rarely the appropriate opener in technical
                                              presentations, the idea of engaging your audience
                                              from the very beginning of your presentation is still
                                              a good practice. Your goal is to make sure your
                                              audience interested in listening even if they are
                                              required to attend. Your choice of opening words
                                              can help establish interest and provide context for
                                              your audience. If you are presenting information
                                              about a safety policy that you think your
                                              employees may not be very interested in, the
                                              opener could be "Did you know our company lost
                                              850 hours due to workplace injuries last year?
                                              That's the equivalent of an entire month of work."
                                              That sort of attention grabber helps to support that
                                              while your audience thinks they already know the
                                              material you are going to present, workplace
                                              injuries actually did impact the company last year.
                                              Or for my example of AI and technical writing,
                                              you might consider an opener such as "Did you
                                              know that it is estimated that nearly 30 million
                                              white collar jobs in tech industries will be replaced
                                              by AI by the year 2030?" That connection could
                                              make teaching about Artificial Intelligence seem
                                              more consequential to your audience members.
                                              Narratives and personal anecdotes can also be an
                                              effective way of humanizing a technical
                                              presentation. It is important to note that these
                                              examples should be relevant to the topic at hand
                                              and should be chosen based on your knowledge of
                                              the audience, as well as the overall purpose of your
                                              presentation.

Establish credibility

It is important to let your audience know who you
are: Tell your audience how you are related to
your work and the content. You may consider:
What/who has brought you here? What work
have you completed to be here? Where does your
expertise lie?

This is less about proving authority and more
about continuing to provide context and
orientation to your audience. For example, if you
are the only person in your field that has explored a
certain topic or you developed a new product or
technology, it's helpful for the audience to
understand you bring an expertise that cannot be
found anywhere else. Or if you are bringing a
proposal to a potential client, you should
distinguish your role on the team. Are you an
engineer who helped develop the proposal and
knows all of the technical details of the proposal?
Or are you a project manager who has a big-
picture perspective of the proposal but may not be
able to answer detailed questions of specific aspects
of the proposal? Your role helps the audience to
have confidence in your presentation and better
understand the perspective you bring to the
material.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 94
Provide a preview

Basic psychology teaches us that people often
remember the first piece of information more
readily than information they receive later on. This
is called the primacy effect and can be used in your
presentation to help your audience recall main
concepts through providing a preview at the
beginning of your presentation [1]. Hearing the
main ideas or the goals of the presentation helps to
prime the audience to receive the presentation
through a specific lens. If your goal is to have your
project team choose between several options,
setting the stage at the opening by saying "This
presentation is going to compare and contrast
multiple vendors so we can select the best solution"
your audience will listen to the presentation
understanding that they will be expected to select a
solution at the end of the presentation. Audience
members then listen to each option already making
comparisons in their minds. In contrast, failing to
provide that information in the beginning, you may
find your project team saying "can you review the
options again, I wasn't expecting to need to make a
decision" and then the time presenting was wasted
and must be repeated.

                                                       The preview can also aid you as the presenter. By
                                                       offering direction to your audience about the
                                                       upcoming content they maintain a sense of
                                                       orientation and expectation, and you are better
                                                       able to track your own progress and adhere to your
                                                       pre-designed content. When crafting your
                                                       preview, keep in mind: "What is my thesis?"
                                                       "What am I trying to accomplish with this
                                                       meeting?" "What do I want the audience to do?"
                                                       With this in place, both you and your audience will
                                                       keep the main idea central to the presentational
                                                       experience.

Define the unfamiliar

Previously you established what the audience will know and not know, based on your audience analysis. Now that you

know what they may not know or may find unfamiliar, it is helpful to define your important vocabulary, acronyms,

abbreviations, industry specific terms or wording that you may use in a unique way. For example, many people use

accuracy and precision as synonyms. But for engineers and scientists, accuracy refers to the relationship between

measured data and an established value, while precision refers to repeatability. This distinction may not seem important

to some, but in technical fields, this is critical knowledge. If you are presenting data to individuals without a technical

background, you may want to define these terms so they do not hear you use them and make faulty assumptions about

your meaning.

                                              they understand the material as intended.

While definitions may take time, these definitions add to the clarity of your presentation and can greatly impact the
outcome. I was once at a presentation where the speaker kept referring to the DOE. As an engineer, this could mean
Design of Experiments (which we explored earlier in this book). As an educator this could mean the Federal or State
Department of Education. The speaker was actually talking about a grant from the Federal Department of Energy, but as
the application was in a college setting, I spent the entire presentation thinking DOE referred to the Department of
Education. It wasn't until the last slide where he included the Department of Energy logo when I realized my error.
Suddenly I was trying to remember everything from earlier in the presentation to see how that mistake could change the
meaning of everything else he said. My interpretation could have been completely wrong. Your audience will typically
assume that they know the correct definition of the terms you use - as the presenter, it is your job to make sure critical
terms are defined so that no confusion occurs with your audience.

                                                         Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 96
                       Organize logically

                                              Regardless of length, your presentation should
                                              have intentional design to present the material in a
                                              way that keeps the central focus clear and provides
                                              the supporting content at times that best facilitate
                                              understanding. This can change based on the type
                                              of presentation and the nature of the audience. For
                                              example, if I am presenting an update to a project
                                              team that has been meeting weekly, I might provide
                                              a brief summary of work done up to this point only
                                              briefly and then address the matter at hand. For a

                                              Just like our written documents, oral presentations
                                              can greatly benefit from an outline to ensure that
                                              each area discussed follows a logical sequence. As
                                              you review your notes (or outline or rough draft)
                                              ask yourself: Does the roadmap make sense? It
                                              can be helpful to receive feedback from someone

                                              typically does not have the same level of subject

Delivery in a polished
manner

While presentations can cause some to be nervous,
the best way to steady your nerves is to be
confident in your material. You should study your
content so that you know your material well
enough for your delivery to be both polished and
flexible.

     1. If you consider a presentation you attended that looked natural and was easy to understand, then you have a
            good idea of what a "polished" presentation entails. As you deliver the presentation, the audience should have
            confidence that you are well prepared and comfortable with the material. The more natural and comfortable
            you look when engaging the audience, the more confidence the audience will have in the material itself.

     2. Reciting a memorized script very quickly, or too quietly to be heard, or without making eye contact with your
            audience can make it difficult for the audience to connect with you and can make the presentation less effective.

     3. Flexibility is critical when presenting. As you deliver your presentation, you should look at your audience and
            use non-verbal cues to see if they are engaged with you and understanding the material. Facial expressions are
            helpful to identify interest, boredom, confusion and other feelings of your audience. If your audience is looking
            elsewhere (like their phone, laptops, reading other materials) or talking to each other, there is a strong likelihood
            that they are not listening to you with the level of attention you desire. If you are flexible in your delivery, you
            can adjust as needed to reorient their attention or explain things more fully if you see looks of confusion.

     4. Presenting to a synchronous audience can be helpful in determining how well your audience is engaged in your
            content and how well they are understanding and retaining what you share. This can be more difficult over
            Zoom or other digital meeting platforms. Many individuals have a more difficult time remaining engaged in a
            large meeting through web-based meeting rooms. It may be helpful to include places to solicit feedback from
            audience members to help keep the attention of those in the meeting.

     5. Most of all, remember that regardless of the size, formality or setting, you are the person most interested in your
            content when you begin to deliver it. If you don't appear to care about it, neither with your audience. A
            perceived lack of confidence in yourself or the material hurts the credibility you have with your audience.

Summarize where you've been

Earlier we discussed the "primacy effect" to aid your audience in retaining the most important concepts of your
presentation. A the end of the presentation, we want to utilize the "recency effect" which is a cognitive bias that
demonstrates that the most recently discussed topics will be retained more clearly than those previously discussed
[2]. As such, the end of your presentation must include a summary to help your audience connect the earlier
content to the most recent content of your presentation. The longer the presentation, the harder it is for your
audience to retain all of the content. Reminding your audience of your central theme and purpose is helpful to
ensure they leave your presentation remembering the critical content. This can be done by summarizing the main
themes into just a few bullet points or a singular statement or question. If you presentation has an expectation for
action (like requesting funding or being awarded a contract from a customer) summarizing the key reasons for the
audience to grant your request can aid a positive outcome.

Formal Presentations

  Formal presentations can be a little easier to manage, as typically there is little audience interaction prior to
  an established question and answer period. This allows you as the presenter to move through your content in
  the order you prepared without worrying about the conversation being sidetracked with tangential topics.
  However, with less overt interaction, keeping your audience's attention and ensuring your content is
  correctly understood is more challenging, as you rely on non-verbal cues, discussed in the previous section.
  Formal presentations also typically have a setting that includes a speaker in front of an audience with formal
  presentational materials (such as a PowerPoint or similar presentation). This distance can make connecting
  with your audience more challenging, especially if it is a large group. Several types of formal presentations
  are described below.

       1. Large Group Presentations and Conferences: Whether industry-based or academic in nature, large group
             presentations can be used to present technical material to a wide audience. These presentations typically use a lecture
             style where the speaker will discuss their topic in its entirety and then offer time for questions. Often the speaker is a
             technical subject matter expert presenting to others who have some interest in the field. In professional and academic
             sessions, attendees can choose which presentations they attend, indicating some internal motivation to learn more
             about your topic. For other large group settings, like corporate presentations, attendance may be mandatory, but often
             you will be presenting to those who have basic subject matter knowledge as being a part of that company, division, or
             industry. This allows you to tailor your material to their prior knowledge and focus on your central message, while
             academic presentations may include audience members with little prior knowledge of your field.

       2. Executive-level Presentations: In these settings, you may be presenting to smaller groups in conference rooms but
             remain formal due to the nature of your audience. In these settings, the focus is rarely on the detailed technical
             information but rather focused on the results of your work and the next steps required. Often executive presentations
             have scheduled lengths and may be integrated into larger meetings, where your presentation is just one of the agenda
             items for that session. It is not uncommon to be interrupted with very direct questions from an executive level audience
             and it is critical to be clear about information that you know for certain and other questions that may require follow-
             up. A common error of new engineers is to try to seem like they know the answer to every question, to project
             excellence in their field. Unfortunately, this good intention can lead to poor outcomes if you miscommunicate
             information and must come back to your audience at a later date to clarify your error. These settings can feel
             intimidating to engineers early in their career. However, extensive preparation and practicing your presentation with
             your supervisor or a mentor can be very helpful in making sure that the presentation is effective and leaves you in a
             positive light.

       3. External Customer Presentations: These presentations are similar to executive level presentations in many ways but
             also involve individuals outside your company. In these presentations, it is important to remember to define corporate
             specific terminology and recognize that the customer may not necessarily share subject matter expertise. For example,
             if you write code for companies to manage their human resource processes, your audience will likely include those in
             senior level administration of Human Resources, not other programmers. Or if a company is looking for your
             company to design a component, it is probably doing so because it does not have this subject matter expertise and
             requires outside help. It is critical to present your material clearly and presents your company and your work in a
             positive way. It can make the difference between whether or not your company continued to work with the customer
             or wins new business.

8.3 Conclusion

Presentational speaking is something that often has an entire course dedicated to learning the best way to present material
to various audiences. This chapter cannot teach everything you need to know to successfully present material to a wide
variety of situations and audiences. However, hopefully this chapter help to remind you of techniques you had previously
learned and see how to apply them in engineering education and professions.

Engineering students may not consider how frequently they will be leading meetings to both internal and external parties
throughout their careers. Understanding the best ways to prepare for each presentation, formal or informal, academic or
industry-based, can make a difference in how your career moves forward. Presenting material clearly, concisely and
correctly to senior level individuals of your company can assist you in future promotions and increased levels of
responsibility. Presenting poorly can hinder your professional development and cause your superiors to doubt the quality
of your work. With these concepts in mind, you can craft a presentation that will not only effectively communicate to
your audience but also demonstrate your competencies in your field.

In the final chapter of the text, ethical considerations for engineers will be considered. This includes integrity in the
reporting, both in written and oral formats, honesty and accuracy with data and the appropriate handling of information,
all which directly connect to technical communications. This reinforces the critical nature of what engineers say, in
addition to how it is said.

Ethical Engineering in
Experimental Design and
Technical Writing

This chapter addresses the ethical obligation engineers have to society concerning public health and safety through
various engineering functions. These can include the dissemination of information, the creation of new products, the
building of common infrastructure, the design of spaces, the development of products and may other functions that
intersect with the world, the natural environment and global society.

9.2 Role of the National Society of
Professional Engineers with Engineering
Ethics

All licensed engineers in the United States of America are members of the National Society of Professional Engineers
(NSPE). This governing body includes an Ethical Review Board in which engineers are held accountable against the NSPE
Code of Ethics. This code has been affirmed by all engineers when they receive their license and all licensed engineers must
uphold that code. Engineers who are thought to have violated the NSPE Code of Ethics are brought before the Ethical
Review Board for further investigation. Those found in violation of the code may receive censure, suspension of their
license or even be banned from practice.
The preamble of the NSPE Code of Ethics states the importance of ethical practice in engineering [2].
Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the
highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people.
Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated
to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional
behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.
The words `honesty", "integrity", "fairness", "equity", demonstrate the system of values that any society might cite when
developing a code of conduct. But for engineers, the focus is plain. The preamble focuses on dedication to "public health,
safety and welfare". This is due to the role engineers play in society. I challenge you to think of a process, product, or
societal system that did not involve an engineer. Consider for a moment an operating room in a hospital: The family
drove a car (which was designed and manufactured by engineers) over roads or bridges or tunnels (designed by engineers)
to a building (designed by engineers), were admitted with software systems (designed by engineers) and moved through a
series of processes to end up in a surgical suite. Every piece of equipment in that surgical suite was designed by an
engineer. An engineer oversaw the manufacturing of the devices. An engineer designed and built the operating room
where the work is taking place. If a surgical robot is assisting, who programmed that robot? Who created a robot capable
of doing precision work for surgical procedures? An industrial engineer assisted in creating the protocols for arranging
the tools and the process used in handing the surgeon each material required. I could go on like this for pages upon pages
on every single ordinary thing people do each day all over the world. Engineers are continually impacting public health,
safety and welfare. It is for our world, for our societies, for our own families, that we must uphold the highest levels of
integrity in our practice.

Each of these fundamental cannons is discussed in
greater detail in the code's Rules of Practice, which
provides specific instructions that relate to every
form of engineering, regardless of discipline or
industry.
For example, as part of cannon 3 "Issue public
statements only in an objective and truthful
manner" there is a subsection [2]: Engineers may
express publicly technical opinions that are
founded upon knowledge of the facts and
competence in the subject matter.
These subsections aim to address many areas of
how the fundamental moral principles apply to the
work of an engineer. These are not lofty ideals or
general concepts. These subsections give specific
guidance on how to interact in a given situation.

Ethics in Practice

Below are some scenarios of experiences I've either
personally faced or had my peers face within the
first 12 months of their work.

Scenario 1

Your relative owns a business that could bid on a job that you are responsible for finding the appropriate contractor.
Your relative has a good match for your company needs and does not have the same last name as you, making it
impossible for anyone to know that you are related to them. While your bidding policies require 3 separate bids, as the
engineer in charge, you know the scope of work and price point that would make a competitive offer to beat the other
potential contractors. Sharing this information would make it easy to award the job to your family without anyone
knowing what had occurred. Is this a conflict of interest or does this fall under the category, "it's not what you know, it's
who you know".
In this case, my friend's older sister went to her sibling asking that her husband be hired for the work. They needed money
and her little brother could really help them out if he awarded them the business. Only six months on the job, freshly
graduated from their bachelor's degree in civil engineering, my friend was an utter wreck. It didn't feel right, but his sister
was really pressuring him. He knew other people had done similar things and gotten away with it. No one would question
him if he kept his mouth shut.
What would you do?

Scenario 2

You find an error in a quality record. The procedure would have you stop production immediately and perform tests on the
suspect material to ensure it is ok, but the employee who made the mistake is very experienced and promises that they simply
entered the data incorrectly. He insists that there is nothing wrong with the product. Your manager, when he hears which
operator wrote it down wrong, shrugs and says, "I'm sure everything is fine." But it is your name on the record validating
that every step of the process was performed correctly. Is this truly an issue worthy of stopping the line or is this an example
of using common sense; there's no need to lose all that money by stopping production.
This took place just one month after I started working as a Production Supervisor in a pharmaceutical manufacturing
facility. We were making a product to help treat children with terminal cancer. What we manufactured would be injected
into the IV of a child who was dying. Should I just assume everything was ok because the worker said so? Should I follow
the guidance of my boss and let it go?
What would you do?

                                                        Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 108
Scenario 3

You find a mistake in a technical drawing for a project already underway but you are sure the customer does not know of
the error. The project is nearing completion and to fix this issue would delay the work and cost a lot of money to fix. You
take it to your boss who then double checks your work and agrees that you have found a mistake. Later you learn nothing
was done to correct it and the project is moving forward with the error. Do you go over their head and tell someone
higher up the chain of command or do you simply think "I told my supervisor. If they don't do the right thing, that's on
them, not on me."
This was the real case situation for a mechanical engineer who had graduated and gone to work at the same company he
had interned at. Although he felt he had a good working relationship with his boss, he really felt the project shouldn't
continue without the customer knowing the issue. He had the least seniority on the team and had already been told to not
worry about it, but he still didn't feel good about it.
What would you do?

These scenarios are real scenarios that raise the
question of personal ethical responsibility,
corporate responsibility and how someone very
quickly find themselves in a morally ambiguous
situation. You will be held accountable to your
actions as an engineer by the National Society of
Professional Engineers. What must you do to
ensure you feel confident in your actions adhering
to the code?

9.4 Ethics in
engineering
professional
organizations

The National Society of Professional Engineers is
not the only organization that provides guidance
for ethical conduct in engineering.

                                                        Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 109
Engineering Education

The professional formation of engineers has long included the recognition of the ethical impact of engineering on society
at large. When reviewing the history of formal evaluation of social competencies in engineering, a significant milestone
occurred in 1997, when the national accrediting board for engineering programs, ABET (Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology) created the Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC 2000). These criteria, which have continued to
evolve over the last 20+ years, documented specific learning outcomes required of engineering educational programs to
remain accredited, one of the two pathways for engineering graduates to pursue a Professional Engineering (PE) license.
In this document, future engineers had to demonstrate proficiencies in multidisciplinary teams, engineering in a global
context and an understanding of contemporary issues, among other technical skills [4]. This "a-k" (updated to 1-7 in
2019) criteria became a foundational element of learning objectives in engineering coursework and curriculum for all
accredited engineering institutions since 2000 [5]. Furthermore, this act was lauded by the National Academy of
Engineers (NAE), in their report "Adapting Engineering Education to the New Century" in which the academy noted the
increasing disparity between engineering practice and engineering education. In their report, they stated that while
engineering faculty had previously demonstrated a resistance to change, the increasing interdependencies of societal needs
and technological solutions required engineering education to better prepare students for multidisciplinary work in a
global context [6]. The call to action raised by the NAE and other organizations has been echoed by engineering
education researchers ever since, with the seminal work of Donna Riley recognizing that engineering education continues
to train future engineers in traditions of consumerism, individualist beliefs and functions within existing power structures,
rather than within societal contexts [7]. The highly cited work of Cech notes that disengagement with social concerns is
often associated with engineering due to prevailing perspective of engineering culture that suggests engineering is neutral,
non-political and that technical skills should be held separate from social tasks [8]. The ideologies of technical/social
dualism, individual meritocracy and depoliticization exclude public welfare from the engineering domain. More recent
studies evaluating engineering education research and current engineering curriculum note that engineering faculty
maintain that humanities studies are irrelevant to engineering education and present engineering problem solving devoid
of social context [9].
The National Academy of Engineers continues to challenge future engineers to view taking on the global "Grand
Challenges of Engineering," including one of the four main themes of engineering innovation to include enhancing the
"joy of living" for the global community [10]. Roscoe et al. stated that "the solution for many pressing challenges requires
engineering innovations that are guided by a keen awareness of human goals, needs, abilities and limitations" (pg. 404)
[11]. This is echoed by other researchers who affirm that these skills are not innate but must be intentionally integrated
into the curriculum for students to practice engineering from these perspectives
The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is the accrediting body over engineering programs
around the nation. As mentioned previously, their adoption of 7 program criteria that all engineering programs should
align to included information about professional ethics in a global context. Namely, their standards for accreditation
include a criteria 3 Student Outcome (Outcome category 4) which states the engineering students should demonstrate "an
ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgements
which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental and societal context." [5]

                                                        Experimental Design and Technical Writing for Engineers | Page 110
This reflects that training is required in ethical judgements as engineering students also learn technical content
foundational to becoming successful engineers. As engineering students learn how to use their technical skill set to
influence the world around them, they must reflect on how that influence can have a positive impact in global, economic,
environmental and societal contexts. This information must be intentionally communicated to become effective in
engineering practice and that process begins in engineering education.

Other Professional Organizations

Many additional organizations that address specific engineering disciplines. For example, the Institute of Industrial and
Systems Engineers endorses both the ABET Code of Conduct and the NSPE Code of Ethics, blending the two documents
to form a unique code for their own members that adds fundamental cannons about professional development and
training of new engineers. The Society of Manufacturing Engineering (SME) bases their Code of Ethics in part on the
NSPE Code of Ethics but add content specific to global manufacturing. Their document includes a fundamental principle
which reads [12]:
The certified professional is dedicated to improving not only the manufacturing process, but also enterprises worldwide.
This includes striving to instill a sense of concern and awareness, throughout the community, of public health, safety,
conservation, and environment issues that are related to the practice of the profession, and through the application of
sound engineering and management principles. Certified professionals realize that in carrying out this responsibility their
individual talent and services can be more effective when combined with continuing education.
This inclusion of management practices and global enterprises reflects the nature of the various management roles for
engineers in global corporations.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) has similar guidelines to the NSPE Code of Ethics but adds
discipline specific language, such as their professional activity requirement to [13]:
to seek, accept, and offer honest criticism of technical work, to acknowledge and correct errors, to be honest and realistic
in stating claims or estimates based on available data, and to credit properly the contributions of others;
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) follows much of the language of the NSPE Code of Ethics but
adds several additional cannons including [14]:
Engineers shall consider environmental impact and sustainable development in the performance of their professional
duties.
This inclusion of environmental responsibility provides explicit language of how engineers impact the natural world, not
only man-made systems. The American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE) has an entire section of their Code of Ethics
dedicated to the natural world in addition to content specific to clients or customers, their company and their peers in civil
engineering [15].
Each profession has adapted the NSPE Code of Ethics but increased the level of responsibilities of engineers in ways that
directly impact their specific discipline. Regardless of the profession, industry or discipline you align with after
graduation, ethical behavior as an engineer is a critical professional skill to ensure your success and the safety of our
societies and our world.

9.5 Ethical Failures of Modern Engineering

Case Studies

The National Society of Professional Engineers published case studies every year highlighting the cases brought before the
Ethical Review Board and includes the relevance of the sections of the Code of Ethics in addition to the decision made by
the committee. While all identifying information is removed, the basic details of each circumstance is presented to help
train engineering students and young engineers about the potential ethical pitfalls that can happen in the workplace. No
one sets out to be morally corrupt, but there are times when little questionable decisions can result in catastrophic
consequences.

Conclusion

It is hard to project where you will first be tested as an engineer in areas of ethical practice. For some, it happens just
months after graduation. Others may go most of their career without facing an issue. But as engineers, each one of us has
responsibilities to those around us, the world at large and the unexplored territories of the deep ocean and far reaches of
space to conduct ourselves adhering to the highest levels of moral integrity and ethical responsibility. Your life may not
depend on it, but someone else's does.
