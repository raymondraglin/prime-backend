Preface

The discipline of Biosystems Engineering emerged in the 1990s from the tradi-
tional strongholds of Agricultural Engineering and Food Engineering. Biosystems
Engineering integrates engineering science and design with applied biologi-
cal, environmental, and agricultural sciences. This book is targeted at 1st-­and
2nd-­year university-l­evel students interested in Biosystems Engineering but
not yet familiar with the breadth and depth of the subject. It is designed as a
coherent educational resource, available as hard copy and for download as
individual digital chapters.

   The origins of the book date back to 2012, when a group of universities, led
by University College Dublin (Ireland) in the European Union (EU) and Virginia
Tech in the United States (US), began working on an EU-­US Atlantis Programme
project called Trans-­Atlantic Biosystems Engineering Curriculum and Mobility
(known as TABE.NET). One of the project activities was to explore the meaning
of Biosystems Engineering. An important output of the work was the framework
for an introductory course focused on Biosystems Engineering. This detailed
how students might best be introduced to the subject and formed the basis for
this textbook. The preparation of the textbook was supported by the American
Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) Harold Pinches and
Glenn Schwab Teaching Materials Fund, intended for projects that "facilitate
development or effective distribution of ASABE teaching materials, including
textbooks," and the Virginia Tech University Libraries' Open Education Initiative
(https://guides.lib.vt.edu/oer/grants). The writing and editing were provided
as voluntary service by the authors and editors, and the ASABE funding sup-
ported the publication process so the online version of the book can be made
freely available around the world (ASABE.org/BE).

   The chapters are intended to stimulate interest and curiosity across the
breadth of Biosystems Engineering and provide an international perspective.
The goal of each chapter is to introduce the fundamental concepts needed to
understand a specific topic within the discipline of Biosystems Engineering; it
is not intended to provide complete coverage of the topic. The scope of each
chapter is narrow enough to be addressed in one week.

   All chapters follow the same structure: Introduction, Outcomes, Concepts,
Applications, and Examples. Following a brief introduction, the learning out-
comes state what the reader should be able to do after studying the chapter.
The outcomes are consistent with expectations for a student engaging with
the topic for the first time, and include being able to describe basic principles,

                                                                                                                                                                   vii
               complete fundamental calculations, and explain how the concepts are used in
               industry or by researchers. The concepts section covers basic principles and
               explains terminology, referencing commonly used sources and using interna-
               tionally accepted units. Once the concepts have been described they are put
               into the context of applications in industry and research to help bring them
               to life. All chapters conclude with worked examples drawing on the concepts
               so that the reader can see how the information provided can be used to solve
               basic problems in Biosystems Engineering. The chapter structure used by this
               textbook could also be used to develop advanced textbooks delving deep into
               any topic relevant to Biosystems Engineering.

                  The inaugural chapters are aligned with six ASABE technical communi-
               ties: Energy Systems; Information Technology, Sensors, and Control Systems;
               Machinery Systems; Natural Resources and Environmental Systems; Plant,
               Animal, and Facility Systems; and Processing Systems.

                  The Energy Systems section focuses on energy from biomass. The section
               places emphasis on feedstock and anaerobic digestion, but considers a wider
               range of technologies from a systems perspective. Specific topics addressed
               in this edition are densification of biomass; energy from organic wastes, fats
               and oils; and bioenergy systems analysis. There is scope for future chapters on
               other topics relevant to this community such as electrotechnology, feedstocks,
               and renewable power.

                  The Information Technology, Sensors, and Control Systems section focuses on
               processing optical sensor data and basic control. The section places emphasis
               on statistical methods as well as practical applications. Specific topics include
               use of optical sensors, multivariate data processing, and microcontrollers.
               Future chapters in this area could focus on topics such as automation, biosen-
               sors, robotics, sensors, and wireless technology.

                  The Machinery Systems section features agricultural technologies used for
               field crops, placing emphasis on the fundamental principles of equipment design.
               Current chapters focus on traction and mechatronics, which are topics that are
               relevant to multiple machinery systems, and on machinery systems for crop
               establishment and grain harvesting. Topics for future chapters could include
               automation, hydraulics, ISO bus, precision agriculture, and other machinery
               systems.

                  The Natural Resources and Environmental Systems section highlights the
               management, protection, and improvement of environmental resources includ-
               ing soil, water, and air. This section places emphasis on field, laboratory, and
               modeling studies related to environmental systems. Specific topics addressed
               are the measurement of gaseous emissions, water budgeting, water quality, soil
               erosion, and management of agri-­food by-p­ roducts using anaerobic digestion.
               Examples of technical areas for future chapters relevant to this community are
               drainage, irrigation, soil and water remediation, wetlands restoration, and sus-
               tainable land management.

                  The Plant, Animal, and Facility Systems section focuses on indoor plant and
               animal production. The current chapters emphasize mass and heat transfer
               for design and operation of agricultural buildings. Specific topics include plant
               production in controlled environments and energy efficiency for livestock

viii ·Preface
housing. Future chapters relevant to this community could include topics such
as grain handling, design of animal production structures, milk handling, manure
management, feed storage and management, and aquaculture.

   The Processing Systems section focuses on the safe processing and distri-
bution of foods. This section places emphasis on heat and mass transfer and
delivery of safe food to consumers. Specific topics addressed are food packaging,
frying, and preservation by freezing, thermal processing, and irradiation. There
is scope for future chapters on other topics relevant to this community such as
food engineering, bioprocessing, bioconversion, drying, and unit operations.

   While each chapter is placed in a single section, many of the topics are
relevant to more than one section, or technical community. The "Anaerobic
Digestion of Agri-­Food By-­Products" chapter in the Natural Resources and
Environmental Systems section nicely illustrates the overlap between technical
communities. Anaerobic digestion is both an environmental technology for the
management of wastes and an energy technology for the provision of renew-
able energy. The chapters in the Plant, Animal, and Facility Systems section also
overlap with the Energy Systems technical community because of the role of
energy, or heat transfer, management in indoor plant and livestock production.
The mechatronics chapter in Machinery Systems overlaps with the Information
Technology, Sensors, and Control Systems community.

   There is scope for contribution of introductory level chapters from the other
ASABE technical communities, Applied Science and Engineering (e.g., forest
engineering, fermentation, engineering and biological fundamentals), Education,
Outreach, and Professional Development (e.g., ethics and professional conduct),
and Ergonomics, Safety, and Health (e.g., vibration, farm safety, ergonomic design,
health and safety training) for the ongoing development of the ASABE digital
education resources.

   Our ambition is for this textbook to continually evolve, with the addition of
new online chapters every year and periodic publication of hard copy volumes.
Each new chapter will follow the standard structure described above and focus
on a specific topic. We believe that in time the textbook will provide a founda-
tional resource used all over the world by students learning about Biosystems
Engineering for the first time.

   In parallel with the preparation of this book, the editors, with the support
of the ASABE Initiative Fund, have been developing the Biosystems Engineer-
ing Digital Library (BEDL). This resource will support instructors by providing
additional teaching and learning materials for use in the classroom and for
assignments. While the library will not be limited to the scope of this book,
from the outset it will be used to support both instructors and students who
use this book. We believe this textbook combined with the BEDL will provide
a global digital teaching resource for Biosystems Engineering for many years
(ASABE.org/BE).
