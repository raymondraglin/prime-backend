                                 institutions. He co-founded GreenCycl, an organization with a
                                 mission to decrease the amount of medical waste. Bart holds a
                                 doctorate in BioMedical Engineering from Delft University of
                                 Technology/TU Delft with a specialization in the circular reuse of
                                 surgical devices and surgical waste materials. During his PhD
research, Bart developed a Field Lab together with Tim Horeman for experimental research
on reprocessing surgical waste into new raw materials and medical products. His research has
won several awards, for example in the Utrecht Circular Innovation Top 20, as builder of the
world's first recycling process for hospital waste.

Bart joined the research group Sustainable Surgery & Translational Technology led by Tim
Horeman at TU Delft, where he is a lecturer on medical device prototyping and teaches several
related courses. Bart focuses on integrating sustainable engineering and circular design in
education as a researcher and lecturer. He has published widely on using the operating room
as gold mine for new raw materials. As chairman of the Royal Dutch Normalization Institute,

                                other data sources. Currently, Tim is leading the development of a
                                new generation of sustainable surgical instruments for advanced
                                (robot) surgery, that should foster the introduction of more
functional instruments in less wealthy parts of the world.

As it is essential to bring lifesaving surgical innovations in reach of surgeons and healthcare
workers, Tim became a distinguished serial medtech entrepreneur with a strong focus on
surgical devices and evidence-based implementation studies. He is PI and (co)founder of the
international companies GreenCycl, MediShield & ForceSense, Surge-on Medical and

was awarded the Dutch royal engineer of the year award for his contributions to the
healthcare sector. In 2018 and 2022 Tim was elected Tech Committee member of the
European Association of Endoscopic Surgery with a strong focus on sustainable surgical
instruments and processes within his newly created definition of "Hospital mining".
Preface

On 18 June 2018, during a healthcare symposium, Bart van Straten presented Bruno Bruins,
Minister for Health, Welfare and Sports of the Netherlands, with a surgical instrument mesh
basket. This instrument basket was made partly from reprocessed and melted stainless steel.

What could not be predicted at that time was the impact this gift would bring to the world. In
fact, this moment can be seen as the start of a time period in which the current linear economy
standards for hospitals started to lose their strength For us, this special day in June to be the
kick-start of what became our journey towards a circular healthcare system. Bart joined the
research group Sustainable Surgery and Translational Technology led by Tim Horeman, which
resulted in a wonderful co-operation between academic and general hospitals, scientific
institutes, governments and the medical industry. This particular day was meant as a message
on how to create awareness. Awareness to protect our beautiful but vulnerable planet and
awareness regarding the limited resources available from our earth.

Together with some leading researchers in the field, the authors examined the world of
circular healthcare and sustainability from different perspectives. In this book, we present our
findings on how to create sustainable healthcare by introducing circular strategies. By using
our experiences as practical case studies, we will demonstrate what strategies and actions can
be taken in order to implement sustainable strategies for a circular healthcare.

This book discusses how hospital waste streams can be used as sources for raw material,
through the lens of science as well as based on our practical experience. It also shows how to
accomplish circular results in team efforts, by motivating others to create a green team.
Within the more holistic perspective of product development and usage, we also deepen
circularity from the viewpoint of neuromarketing. Neuromarketing can be a powerful tool to
study consumer behavior and investigate neuronal processes involved in the memorization of
brand names and logos, but also reward mechanisms linked to brand loyalty, sustainability
and circular products. Finally we look at a Bare Minimum design philosophy for medical
devices. This method is currently in development and aims to reduce parts in instrument
designs without compromising functionality in order to become more sustainable.

This book follows the course of the EdX TU Delft MOOC courses which we developed. This
MOOC, or Massive Open Online Courses, are freely available for participants from all over the
world with a laptop and internet connection who want to extend their knowledge on a specific
subject. Our online program "Circular strategies for a sustainable healthcare" consists of two
courses:

      Circular strategies for hospitals
      Circular suppliers for MedTech suppliers

  Engineering a circular healthcare: The curse of
                      global growth

Our world is the only planet, as far as we know, which hosts life. The number of humans on
our planet, however, has grown tremendously in the last two centuries. It took 200.000 years
for earth's population to reach one billion, in 1800. This number has grown to over 8 billion in
2022. In 2057 an estimated 10 billion humans will inhabit the earth.1

A result of this growth, the amount of primary greenhouse gas emitted by human activities,
carbon dioxide (CO2), has grown as well. These emissions, and those of other greenhouse
gases, constitute a growing environmental threat for the next generations. The increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere cause the long-term increase of
earth's temperatures, also referred to a global warming.

On 12 December 2015, an international treaty was signed by 196 parties in Paris to limit global
warming to less than 20C, preferably less than 1.50 C.2 European climate law demands that the
European Union should become climate neutral by 2050. The aim is to decrease CO2 emissions
by 49% (later increased to 55%) in 2030, compared to 1990.

A large part of these emissions is caused by burning fossil fuels and farming. The generation
of electricity is a large source of pollution, since in many countries electricity is made by
burning coal and gas. The transformation to renewable energy, including solar, wind and
hydrogen energy, is therefore essential.

While the earth's population grew, so did our mass consumption society. During the
globalization, humans have become focused on consumerism and individual growth. This
development has changed our socioeconomic system and consequently, our personal norms
and values. Human priority continues to be aimed at economic growth and personal wealth,
even when it became evident that the hole in the Ozon layer above the South Pole was caused
by humans, and that temperatures continue to rise in the lower atmosphere.

After the Second World War, humanity experienced gigantic global economic development,
including great technological improvements. Computers, laptops, airplanes, tablets and the
internet connected humans and equipment with each other, all over the world. The hunger
for plastics and steel grew as all products had to be manufactured in ever-increasing volumes.
As economies developed, so did our needs for the growth of wealth. Products became more
complex and more different materials were combined.

                                                            14
With the rise of products such as computers, tablets and smartphones, more and more
materials were included in devices. This was further supported by the introduction of single-
use products, so-called disposables that can be seen as a product of absolute wealth. Where
people bought a television in the last century, it was expected to last for many years. Now,
people purchase a new smartphone or tablet every year. And as an absolute disastrous black
page in sustainable health evolution, new disposables like E-cigarettes were allowed to enter
the market and consists of an atomizer, a poisonous power source such as a battery, and a
container which often end up on the street after being used.

Thus, a growing population with a growing need for disposable wealth needs more and more
resources. Humanity is caught in a spiral in which the use of materials increases like a curse,
from which we have as yet not managed to free ourselves. In fact, we no longer realize how
much disposable material we consume in both the consumer markets as well as in the
business industry (Figure 1).

Evolving healthcare

The same applies to the healthcare sector, and specifically to hospitals. The number and
different types of medical devices and disposables has grown considerably. With the growing
population, the number of patients grew as well. Medical instruments, which were mostly
reusable in the previous century, were converted from reusable to disposable. New
technology and disposable devices, developed for single use, meant higher sales volumes for
the medical industry and more products consumed by hospitals. From an engineering
perspective, these products were designed with requirements that fit mass production and
mass consumption. With the introduction of robotic surgery, even more disposables were
needed, including disposable endoscopes, disposable energy devices, disposable robotic
instruments and many more. While new technology was introduced in the operating room,
there seemed to be no awareness of the growing volumes of waste this generated. The
growing amount of hospital waste and its impact on the environment appeared to be a direct
consequence from the growth of the human population, the introduction of new technology
and the increased use of disposables.3

Only recently the challenges posed by this development became more evident, as awareness
has risen of the shortage of raw materials, the waste generated by hospitals and the
environmental impact that result from both the production of medical devices as well as from
the consumption of these devices. The consequences of availability of (raw) materials became
clear during the Covid-19 pandemic. Shortages suddenly emerged all over the world; for
example, the unanticipated scarcity of face masks lead to circumstances in which doctors and
nurses were not protected when treating Covid patients.4 Another consequence was that the
waste generated by hospitals as a result of the Covid pandemic grew with thirty percent.
Although (plastic) medical waste is incinerated in many countries, we also find this type of
waste on landfills or even in the local environment. In the first year of the Covid pandemic, 52
billion face masks were manufactured, with an estimated number of over 1.56 billion entering
our oceans.5

Medical plastics

Finally, the environmental impact of specifically medical grade plastic waste streams appeared
extremely high, considering that many medical plastics like drapes, gowns and face masks are
made out of polypropylene, a thermoplastic polymer. Polypropylene (PP) belongs to the group
of polyolefins and has comparable characteristics as polyethylene. Compared to polyethylene,
the material is affordable, it is relative strong and has a good chemical resistance. Hence the
reason why companies such as Tupperware prefer to use this material for storage of food and
drinks. For these reasons also many medical devices are made from this type of plastic.

Polypropylene (PP) is a highly easy-to-mold material and therefore used all over the world for
injection molding. Despite its semi-crystalline nature, its low viscosity means it flows very well
during injection molding. The melting point and strength mean an endless range of products
can be made out of polypropylene. Disposing of polypropylene products raises some concerns,
however. Greenhouse gases are emitted when it is incinerated, as well as dioxins and vinyl
chloride. If it decomposes in landfill, it has harmful effects on ecological systems. These are
especially caused by the additives used in PP to enhance its mechanical properties, to stabilize
the polymer and to make it easier to process.
Many medical products are currently designed for single-use application, not only made of PP
but also other types of plastics and metals. The types of plastic products found within the
plastic waste streams may differ per hospital, however. In the OLVG hospital, in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands, an overview showed that 50% of the total plastic waste consisted of
disposables packaging. Based on their weights, these materials were made up mainly of
polypropylene (PP), followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), mixed high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) with coated medical-grade paper, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Bubble
wrap, composed of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), used for deliveries, made up 25% of total
plastic waste.6
Medical metals
Stainless steel types 304 and 316 are mostly used for medical instruments. Type 316 is more
corrosion resistant, since it has a higher chromium and nickel content. Medical instruments
need to be disinfected, washed and sterilized after every procedure. This is done in a Central
Sterilization and Services Department (CSSD) as shown in Figure 2. Corrosion resistance for
instruments is very important, as the washing and sterilization procedure are chloride-
exposing. Type 316 is also more expensive than 304. This is why single-use instruments are
typically made out of type 304 and reusable instruments of 316.7

Single-use metal instruments are used in growing volumes in hospitals around the world. The
trend in the wealthier parts of the world has been to switch to single-use steel instruments.
They are cheaper, always sterile and need less stock management. A stainless steel disposable
instrument set consisting of a needle holder, tweezers and scissors usually costs less than 3
Euros. The medical industry has set up a lucrative line to sell these single-use products in large
volumes to hospitals. After one use, these instruments are collected by waste processors in
order to be incinerated.

Market dependency

Reusable instruments are up to 50 times more expensive than their disposable alternatives
they need to be (re)sterilized. Since long-term use is not taken into account in budget
calculations for most hospitals, it may look cheaper to use single-use products, regardless of
their impact on the environment or on patient safety. In some cases, devices are only offered
to hospitals as single-use variants, since reusable versions have been phased out by
manufacturers of the production programs due to cleaning and sterilization issues or the
reusable versions were considered not to be profitable enough. Thus, the hospitals depend
on the options available in the market and cannot easily decide on their own initiative to
change to reusable products.

Undoubtedly, economic growth and globalization have brought wealth to the western world,
but they have also led to a tsunami of mass production. Products that were once reusable can
now be used only once. Higher sales volumes mean the economy is growing and so is the
income of shareholders, investors and local economies - but also the impact on the
environment.

How can we turn the tide? Is waste reprocessing best option to reduce these negative impacts
on the environment and where should we start? These are the questions that will be
elaborated on in this book.

Global awareness
In this book we will explore possible solutions which will have a positive impact on the
environment. Or rather, measures we can take to reduce the negative impact on the
environment. Some of these measures are easy to take and others require more effort. The
most important is to change awareness of the general public. Individuals can have a great
influence on this. In this book we provide a number of tools to help to create a society
producing less waste. Readers with both technical and non-technical backgrounds can have a
major impact on reducing waste.
While the world is struggling with scarcity of raw materials and the finite capacity of natural
ecosystems, we will discuss in this book some strategies through which the (healthcare)
economy can continue to grow and still become sustainable. As a counterpoint to the
geological raw materials extraction from conventional mines, urban mining extracts raw
materials from waste: the operating room is a goldmine for raw materials hence the creation
of the new term "Hospital Mining". We will see how this promising concept could solve our
major sustainability and raw material scarcity problems.
By turning surgical waste into new products, we will experience a new era of possibilities in
the circular economy. We will learn how to reduce and reuse waste but also how to reprocess
plastic and metal waste contaminated and non-contaminated from hospitals, thus reducing
scarcity, reducing costs, and reducing climate change impact.
It will become clear that the reprocessing of metals is not only environmentally-friendly but
also has a direct financial benefit, as some materials are valuable and can generate a revenue.
Therefore, we will investigate how we can eliminate waste by following new (re)-design
methodologies.
We will also discuss how we can change from mass-consumption driven product design to
sustainable design, using the Butterfly Diagram as an engineering model and fundamental
principle to create a circular economy. Moreover, various aspects and possibilities will be
analyzed in this book for how to design a green (dream) team.

                                                                                                                         19
We will take you through the steps you need to take to get from a good idea to shared
agreements with all stakeholders involved. Finally, we will discuss how we can create more
public awareness and influence the buying behavior of consumers. It seems that everyone is
talking about the circular economy but very few concrete actions are being taken after
problems are identified. If we want to achieve the climate goals, we will have to make an
impact with an ever-growing group. This book was created to provide some guidance by using
evidence-based examples that were published in scientific journals, in order to allow new
circular initiatives to emerge. With willpower, technology, evidence-based solutions and
common sense, we will achieve this.

Main takeaways of this chapter
        It took 200.000 years for mankind to grow to one billion humans in 1800. Only 222
           year later this number has grown to over 8 billion in 2022; it is expected to pass 10
           billion in 2057.
        While the earth's population grew, so did our mass consumption society. After the
           Second World War, the world experienced a gigantic global economic development
           with great technological improvements and more complex products, resulting in the
           use of more materials.
        As a result of this growth, the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), the primary
           greenhouse gas emitted by human activities, has increased significantly.
        The impact on the environment of hospital waste grew apace, as a direct
           consequence of the growth of the human population and the increased use of
           disposables in hospital care.
        Challenges which became more evident during the past decades are the shortage of
           raw materials, the waste generated by hospitals and the environmental impact that
           results from both the production of medical devices and the consumption of these
           devices.

                                                                                                                         21

 Circular engineering and the Butterfly Diagram

The post-war global economic development, also referred to as the golden age of capitalism,8
meant global expansion of economic growth. The term globalization began to be used in the
1980s, although many historians claim that the globalization of international trade had already
started with Columbus's arrival in America in 1492. The exploration of new continents led to
worldwide trade and eventually to globalization of individuals through their connectivity in
global networks. This connectivity reflected the technological developments that enabled
international trade and cross-boundary transactions. In essence, this could be considered a
positive development, bringing the world closer together. The technological developments in
aviation, logistics and the internet in the 1990s changed the world further and new markets
and producers emerged. The generation born in the 1940s saw revolutionary technological
developments such as the introduction of the television, jet planes, personal computers, space
exploration, the fax and the digital camera. All these developments led to more complicated
products, which consisted of more different materials. These days, products such as laptops
and complex surgical instruments consist of almost all elements of the periodic table.

This growing wealth and global prosperity, in combination with a rapid growth of the
population gave birth to the mass consumption society, as described in chapter 1. This society
was based on the principle `make - use - dispose', also called the linear economy. This
economy uses raw materials and transforms them into products that are consumed and then
discarded as waste. The economic value model is based on manufacturing and selling as many
products as possible.

After decades of severe natural resource depletion, it is now clear that a move is needed
towards a circular economy. This is based on the principle `make - use - reuse'. In this system,
the product lifecycle is extended and waste is minimized or even completely absent, as all
elements are reused.9 Stahel10 mentions that the circular economy consists of "closed loop
systems", distinguishing two different types of loops: (1) reuse of goods, and (2) recycling of
materials.

The circular economy as a term appeared for the first time in 1988 in "The Economics of
Natural Resources".11 It was used by China in 2002 - by that time the world leader in the
manufacturing of products - as a political measure with regard to combating environmental
damage and resource depletion. The Ellen McArthur Foundation, a non-profit organization
creating evidence-based research on the circular economy, promoted the concept of the
circular economy and published a guideline called "Towards the Circular Economy"12 in 2013
to find solutions for growing problems like climate change, waste and pollution. The European
Union uses the circular economy as a recovery strategy to stimulate a more EU.13 Clearly, the
importance of creating a circular economy is now widely recognized, but it has not yet become
reality.
A circular economy typically follows the approaches of reduce, reuse and recycle.

     Minimizing the use of resources (R of reduce).
     Maximizing the reuse of packaging, products, components, water, energy (R of reuse).
     Recycle products and packaging when reuse is not feasible anymore (R of Recycle).

Taking the three Rs into consideration during the design of new products and processes is
essential. Used products should be the resources for new raw materials and new products.
Reuse, repair, maintenance, remanufacturing, recycling keep products and materials in
circulation which will result in reduction of waste streams.
A circular healthcare economy
A circular healthcare economy can be achieved by designing products and processes which
lead to reuse of products and components, again and again. In other words, value is recreated
every time a product or component is reused. It is clear that from an engineering perspective,
circular economy principles require another mindset, a different design approach. Therefore,
it's time to rethink how we design, make and use the things we need.
Introducing a circular economy approach to hospital waste streams is not easy. Hospitals are
frequently standardized on single-use products. Even worse, concepts such as pay-per-use,
the sharing of capital goods between hospitals, and reuse, repair, maintenance and
refurbishment, i.e. extending product life cycles, are unknown and often not considered or
desired for various reasons. It will therefore take time to reinvent the healthcare sector and
the products it makes and uses.
The next generation of designers and visionaries can help the world to reinvent product design
and the processes around new products, based on the idea of designing out waste: designing
in such a way that products can be reused entirely without generating waste. The Butterfly
Diagram,12 published by the Ellen McArthur Foundation, is a model which can help us to
explore strategies to eliminate waste.

The original Butterfly Diagram
The Butterfly Diagram, as shown in Figure 1, visualizes the circular economy. The cycles on the
left- and the right-hand side illustrate the circular strategies. The circles on the left-hand side
show the biological loops creating renewable flows. The nutritional values of biodegradable
materials are returned to the earth to regenerate nature.
The right-hand side shows the technical loops by which materials are kept in circulation
through cycles such as reuse, maintenance, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling.
These circular strategies minimize the generation of waste. They extend the product lifecycle
and aim to reuse waste as raw material if other strategies are not possible.
Circular strategies help to protect our natural resources by reducing the use of primary raw
materials. Waste is prevented by keeping products in use for longer. Circular strategies
contribute to preventing shortages in the supply chain. Furthermore, they limit the
environmental impact resulting from the production and consumption of products and the
generation of waste.

Designing out waste: how to design for future generations
A large part of the materials we use for medical devices is made from fossil fuels and iron ore.
Eurostat, the official statistics website of the European Union, describes fossil fuels as non-
renewable energy, including coal, coal products, natural gas, derived gas, crude oil, petroleum
products and non-renewable waste.14 The extraction of these natural resources, their
manufacture into products, the transport and use of these products, and their disposal after
use have a variety of environmental impacts. Climate change, measured in carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions, is one of the most important ones.
Designing products which require less materials and less energy will result in the reduction of
CO2 emissions. A design transformation from single-use to reusable products will therefore
help to reduce the amount of waste and its environmental impact.
Currently, humanity is producing over 380 million tons of plastic each year. According to
Earthday.org,15 the amount of plastic produced every year is more or less equivalent to the
entire weight of all humans on earth. The organization also reports that humans use 1.2
million plastic bottles per minute, approximately 91% of which are not recycled. About half of
the worldwide annual plastic production is destined for single-use products. For example, 500
billion plastic cups are used around the world every year. When disposed, these plastics break
down into tiny toxic particles called microplastics that contaminate the soil and waterways
and enter food chains.
Sustainable design
Sustainable design starts at the beginning, by selecting materials that increase the lifetime of
the product and have a low(er) impact on the environment. This has a significant impact on
the reduction of waste streams. It's preferable if products can be repaired easily and are made
of materials that can be recycled. Using special design techniques may further help to design
out waste and pollution. An example is honeycombing, which increases the strength and
reduces the amount of material used. The reduction in weight not only means less raw
material is necessary, but also fewer parts. Furthermore, the weight to be transported is lower
and, in the end, less energy is needed for recycling. Good design choices have a lasting impact
on CO2 emissions, creating a positive impact for years to come.

Circular design
The terms sustainability, circular economy and circularity are often used interchangeably.
Sustainability is more broadly defined and refers to people, the planet and the economy.
Obviously, from the environmental context we mean ecological sustainability. But if you would
ask an economist, you will hear a definition of sustainability from a business context, economic
sustainability. Let's use a broad definition, depending on what perspective you have. Most
importantly, it's all about not being harmful to the environment or depleting natural
resources.
When it comes to the circular economy, we see a more focused definition. The circular
economy aims to minimize through smarter product design, longer use, remanufacturing,
recycling and to regenerate nature. When we speak about circular design, we mean the design
of products and processes which keep raw materials longer in production cycles and which
can be used repeatedly with the aim of reducing or even preventing waste. Where we could
consider sustainable design to be defined as reducing negative impacts on the environment
in general, circular design is aimed at developing durable, reusable, repairable, re-
manufacturable and recyclable products that generate no waste, and using products,
components and materials over and over again. The principle of circular design of any product
or process is that waste must be minimized or prevented. This type of design aims to keep the
product in use as long as possible. It applies circular strategies in the design, such as
possibilities for reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing or recycling of the product, as
described in the Butterfly Diagram. Basically, circular design can be seen as a movement, a
philosophy, a different way of thinking that develops products, processes and business models
based on preventing waste and preserving the earth's natural resources. Three design
strategies can be used to avoid disposal at the end of the life of the product: 16,17

1. Extending product life by designing a durable product with a long lifetime.
Use features that enable repair of the product by replacing broken components or allow
maintenance. Design easy access to components and easy removal and replacement of
components. Strategically replace components that limit the lifetime of the total system
(often for commercial reasons) by new sustainable designs.
2. Reuse or remanufacture.
The best option is direct reuse without any changes. If the product cannot be reused `as is',
then next are products designed with components which can be harvested at the end-of-life
of the product and reused for the (re)manufacturing of a new product.
3. Recycling and material recovery.
Design for recycling means selecting specific materials which can be reprocessed and re-used
after the disassembly of a product. Recycling not only means that no new virgin or primary
raw materials are needed, it also means that no CO2 emissions are caused by the
manufacturing of such virgin or primary raw material.
Following the Butterfly Diagram, the following circular design concepts can be applied to
remove waste from the design:

     Design for reuse.
     Design for repair.
     Design for refurbishment.
     Design for disassembly.
     Design for remanufacturing.
     Design for recyclability.

The common factor of influence of all these strategies can be found in the effort it takes to
disassemble a device. The easier it can be disassembled, the less energy is used and the
"greener" the product becomes. Therefore, a more generic strategy, "design for disassembly"
is often found in the literature.

                                                                                                                         29
Design for Reuse

Design for reuse keeps products in use with a longer product lifecycle. Every time the product
is reused, it does not enter the waste stream and no energy is needed to manufacture new
products. Furthermore, this method prevents raw materials being extracted for making new
products. In this case, new sales models have to be created, since reuse leads to lower
manufacturing and sales volumes.

Design for repair increases the product lifecycle. Due to growing complexity, in recent decades
many products have become harder to repair, with growing waste streams as a consequence.
Products based on the "design for repair" concept should facilitate repair whenever needed.
This concept involves easy-to-repair principles imbedded in the design, including ease of
disassembly and reassembly, and good accessibility of components and replacement parts.
Furthermore, this design method should facilitate the use of standard tools.

Design for refurbishment is aimed at making products which can be serviced at any given time
in order to increase their lifespan. This may include repairs, but also thorough cleaning,
lubrication, replacement of components and surface treatment, such as glass pearl, aqua
blasting or polishing. The repair of medical devices is often seen as a reactive response, i.e.
products are repaired when they malfunction, while refurbishment can be considered a pro-
active treatment in order to prevent breakage or damage of the device.

Design for remanufacturing means designing a product, of which the parts can be used in
combination with new and/or other reused parts to (re)manufacture a new product. The new
product, made out of the reused parts, functions according to the specifications of the original
product. The parts can also be used in the manufacturing for various other kinds of products.

Design for recycling means designing products which include compatibility of the product
components and packaging with known recycling streams. Recycling can be done with less
energy than primary production, thus reducing CO2 emissions. An important aspect is using
more of the same types of materials when designing products and packaging. The fewer
different materials, the easier it is to recycle the product at the end of its product life.

Design for disassembly is one of the fundamental principles to use across all of these design
concepts. The effectiveness of design for disassembly determines the product lifecycle and
the level of waste prevention. After all, the easier a product is disassembled, the easier it is to
repair, refurbish, remanufacture or recycle. This means, first of all, minimizing the number of
components and designing components made from high-quality materials. In all cases,
destructive disassembly must be prevented. Therefore, special attention needs to be directed
to the fasteners between components, which should prevent destroying components when
disassembling. Preferably, connections should not be glued, but made with screws or snap-fit
connections, leaving components intact for reuse. Furthermore, clear instructions for repair
and soft disassembly of the product should be provided. Table 1 shows the various options for
circular design principles.

Applying circular design principles means products and components have longer lifecycles.
Product designs which are compliant with the circular economy will last longer and generate
less waste than linear products. They will be easier to reuse, repair, remanufacture and
recycle. Thus, they contribute to the objectives of the circular economy:

1. Having enough resources.
2. Reducing waste streams associated with these resources (production and consumption).
3. Reducing environmental pressure.

Designing circular processes
Reuse is a strong aspect of the circular economy. It is often said that refusing to use disposable
products automatically results in reuse. However, it is not always possible to refuse using
disposables. This is the case, for example, with the FFP2 face masks used to protect healthcare
professionals during the Covid period. The first Covid wave in the spring of 2020 brought a lot
of uncertainty: Covid vaccines still had to be developed and the consequences and severity of
the disease were not yet foreseeable.
It was therefore deemed unsafe to use face masks more than once, leading to a massive surge
in the use of disposable face masks. The pandemic resulted in global scarcity of various
products and materials. This was also the case with FFP2 face masks; the scarcity of personal
protection equipment led to life-threatening shortages for healthcare professionals.
Born out of necessity, the authors of this book, affiliated to TU Delft and GreenCycl, developed
a fast reprocessing and testing method that showed how the reuse of single-use medical
devices led to an impactful solution for the scarcity, as well as a reduction of cost and CO2. The
reprocessing method allowed the safe reuse of face masks for a maximum of five times.
From March 2020 to June 2020 our team reprocessed, as requested by several hospitals, more
than 75,000 face masks, using steam sterilization at 1210C. Our methods were published in
academic journals, so that hospitals around the world could sterilize and reuse their face
masks as well.
The benefits of the circular economy became evident in this case study. First of all, the scarcity
of face masks was counteracted by reusing products. Secondly, we learned that through the
use of circular strategies, waste was limited: face masks were not disposed of, but collected
in order to be sterilized. Thirdly, the environmental impact of the waste was reduced.
We conducted a lifecycle assessment, a study that calculates the environmental impacts
throughout the entire lifecycle of a product, from extraction of raw materials to production,
transport, use and end-of-life. We calculated that CO2 emissions were reduced by 58% when
reusing face masks five times, instead of disposing of them after one use. The environmental
impact when reusing face masks was calculated using 18 impact categories, showing a 70%
reduction in land use and 57% reduction in water consumption, despite the fact that the face
masks were reprocessed using steam sterilization.

Main takeaways of this chapter
        The linear economy is based on a "make - use - dispose" premise, whereas the
           circular economy is based on a "make - use - reuse" principle. A circular healthcare
           economy is aimed at reducing hospital waste volumes and is a derivative of the
           circular economy.
        The right-hand side of the Butterfly Diagram shows the technical loops where
           materials are kept in circulation through cycles such as reuse, maintenance,
           refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling. The loops are circular strategies
           helping to minimize the generation of waste.
        Circular strategies protect natural resources by reducing the use of raw materials.
           Waste is prevented and keeping products in use for longer contributes to preventing
           shortages of resources in the supply chain, as well as limiting the environmental
           impact of waste.
        Following the Butterfly Diagram, the following circular design concepts can be
           applied to limit waste: Design for reuse, Design for repair, Design for refurbishment,
           Design for remanufacturing and Design for recyclability.

           Designing a green (dream) team

Circular engineering goes further than just designing a sustainable product which can be used
again and again. It involves the input of people, organizations and markets, since the product
must be acceptable for all involved parties. Taking back used products or packaging in order
to reuse or recycle the materials could be part of the circular concept; the focus could also be
on repair, maintenance and availability of spare parts and potential remanufacturing
possibilities. All of these aspects determine whether a circular product or service will be
successfully accepted by the market, but they require a different vision than most current
business models. Therefore, developing a circular product which is embedded in a circular
process requires vision, strategic thinking and communication skills.
The awareness that our economic system has directly damaged the environment has led to
increased motivation for many to do something about it. More and more people have a
personal desire to stop environmental damage. More people in the medical sector too are
willing to work together in a team with highly intrinsically motivated colleagues and partners
to come up with solutions to make a difference. Evidence based circular solutions, leading to
green results, can be a motivator on a small or large scale. We exclude from this discussion
"greenwashers" who use sustainability as a motivator to make money, but have no positive
effects on the environment in the long term.

                                                            36
Integrating circular processes in an organization
Implementing processes which are dedicated to reducing CO2 emissions may not be received
enthusiastically by everyone. It requires managing people with different values; this is often
considered as one the most challenging and most critical processes when implementing
change.
A growing phenomenon in hospitals and medical companies is the formation of special circular
task forces, so called green teams. These green teams aim to shape and roll out sustainability
in their organization. In practice, however, it is common to see that not everyone is willing to
step out of their comfort zone. Some are actively resistant, while a more passive lack of
engagement among medical staff may also be a showstopper for introducing new
(sustainable) processes and products.21
When establishing a green team, it is important to define critical success factors. Kotter
defined eight steps which could be applied when designing new processes to be introduced in
an organization.22 These steps can be helpful in many situations, such as designing and
creating a circular product line at a medical supplier or establishing a team at a hospital in
order to increase the level of sustainability.

The following steps help to create a successful basis for team performance:
Step 1. Create urgency
Define the need for a circular process; establish what the advantages and opportunities are.
Step 2. Create a vision for change
Define a clear vision. Project five years ahead. Align you vision with business values and make
it inspiring.
Step 3. Create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Create Key performance indicators that allow you to define success based on real evidence.
Use tools that are often seen in Heath Tech Assessment (HTA's) and Live Cycle Assessments
(LCAs) to gather and process data in a responsible way and to extract the right knowledge.
Step 4. Form a powerful coalition
Ask ambassadors for your team who are able to convince others. Establish a diverse mix of
people from different departments.
Step 5. Communicate your vision
Communicate the circular vision frequently, in newsletters, internal communications and
digitally, to all levels and all departments.
Step 6. Remove obstacles
Identify people who are reluctant and talk to them. Stimulate those who defend your vision.
Step 7. Ensure short-term wins
Identify quick wins. Share and communicate successes. Reward the people who help you to
reach your goals and successes.
Step 8. Build on change
Build on your successes. Use the key success factors and apply these.
Step 9. Anchor the changes in organizational culture
Share you vision with the entire organization and make it visible to outsiders. Define the
organization's core values and share these with new staff. Create a long-term plan.

Example of a Dutch green team established for the reprocessing of blue wrap

In 2021 a team was set up to recover blue wrapping paper waste from the operating room
(OR) of Maasstad Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The mission was ambitious. As a TU
Delft research team, the authors wanted to be the first in the world to create a reprocessing
process for blue wrapping waste from the OR. Blue wrap is made from polypropylene, and
prices and delivery times for polypropylene continue to increase; it therefore seemed a
promising material for reuse. A field lab (GreenCycl Fieldlab) was created with a reprocessing
line consisting of disinfection machines, a melting oven, a granulation machine and an
injection molding machine.

The idea was to process, granulate and injection mold new products out of surgical waste at
the field lab. The sense of urgency (step 1) was created by stating that we wanted to be the
first to develop a validated process for surgical waste reprocessing.

The team consisted of influential people from different departments from Maasstad hospital,
including the staff from the operating room and the central sterilization and services
department (OR, CSSD), staff of waste reprocessing company Renewi, team members from
GreenCycl and from TU Delft - a diverse mix of team members (step 2).

A concrete goal was set for the `blue wrap reprocessing' green-team based on a clear vision
(step 3). This vision included that the GreenCycl field lab, based in the center of the
Netherlands, would become the central hub in the country. New processing technology was
validated with regard to efficient workflows, based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
These aspects were tested with researchers from Delft University of Technology (step 4). In
the long term a recycling facility would be set up for all other hospitals offering their waste for
reuse; a facility where waste would be converted into raw materials and new medical products
all based on throughout validation of the material flow after each transformation step. This
vision was based on the growing scarcity of raw material. Furthermore, the vision was to
create a healthcare environment with fewer CO2 emissions for all participating hospitals.

This vision was repeatedly communicated (step 5). A video was made showing the entire
process, and launched through social media, including YouTube. Maasstad Hospital
communicated this vision on a frequent basis both internally and externally through multiple
conferences. Furthermore, the media were contacted to share our vision, which led to
extensive coverage in many magazines and trade journals. We also invited stakeholders such
as representatives from hospitals, industry, government, NGO's, schools and universities to
come and visit the field lab, so that our vision could be visualized.

As with many new developments, physical and mental obstacles were encountered during the
process that hamper process which needed to be removed (Step 6). An important obstacle to
overcome were legal limitations. By law, medical waste in the Netherlands must be
incinerated. Permits or exemptions were therefore necessary to start a process which deviates
from existing procedure. This obstacle was finally overcome by personal contact with the
Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports, as well as the local enforcement agency, responsible
for enforcing the waste regulations. These parties were invited to discuss the collection of
waste; they supported our initiative and were eager to create legal possibilities.

                                                                                                                         39
Rather than an obstacle, this became a great opportunity for co-operation with officials who
were willing to look beyond the rules and were just as enthusiastic as we were. They even
helped us to categorize waste as raw material, so that the standard rules no longer applied.
After nine months, we were granted a license to reprocess potentially contaminated surgical
waste into raw material. This was a giant step for the green team, but also for the whole
country, since this was the first time in history that surgical waste could be transformed into
raw material and new medical products. Mental obstacles were often found to be related to
an increase of expected task time due to changes in the workflow. These obstacles can be
taken away by explaining the urgency, showing the bigger picture and by ensuring that all
employees become part of the sustainability experience.

Most of the resistance was encountered when we published our progress on social media,
when people posted objections to our posts on LinkedIn and Facebook. Remarkably, most of
the objections came from people who were active in the recycling industry or in start-ups
working on similar activities. Even though it is possible that these objections were based on
feelings of competition or envy, it is important to analyze criticism and enter into discussion
with anyone who objects. Open and transparent communication can have many advantages.

Our team realized a quick win (step 7) when the first batch of blue wrap was collected and
melted in our field lab. This was celebrated with the team members and communicated
among all participating organizations. A video was produced and published. Dutch media
covering the first results further contributed to sharing the first successes. Thus, we were able
to demonstrate the value of circular processes, which in turn created feelings of trust,
openness and commitment to promote circular processes in hospitals, and encouraged others
to start similar projects.

Step 8 was to build on the successes we accomplished. When the process was validated and
results were benchmarked, the process was scaled up in terms of volumes and anchored in
more hospitals, extending from Maasstad Hospital to eleven other hospitals. We also started
to make a larger variety of products out of the reprocessed waste. The first product, an
instrument opener, received CE approval on 22 March 2022. After that date, more medical
devices were designed and made out of the reprocessed waste. The results were published in
the Journal for Cleaner Production.23

The 9th step was, and still is, to standardize the way of working in all participating hospitals
regarding the process of collecting blue wrapping paper waste from the OR and transporting
it to the field lab, where it is melted, granulated and used for injection molding of new medical
products.

Working with academia

Circular processes aim to reduce waste streams, but also to learn and create new insights that
lead to new areas of expertise. Collaborating with universities and colleges is an excellent
opportunity to bundle knowledge and record it in education. A good start is to follow a multi-
disciplinary approach, as knowledge is of great importance within a well-functioning team. It
goes without saying that a team within a single entity will have the knowledge required for
the many processes, products and waste streams within a hospital. That is why it is important
to actively collaborate with knowledge institutions such as universities, colleges and centers
of expertise. Experts with a technical, social and psychological background are highly valuable
as team members or external consultants.

From this context, collaborative skills are essential for the success of a green team and
therefore every team member should have these skills. To facilitate new multidisciplinary
green team projects in an initial phase, an existing course at TU Delft was modified in 2021.
The following two examples illustrate the value of collaboration and sharing expertise with
different experts.

Every year ten projects are formulated during the TU Delft course `Medical Device
Prototyping'. These projects are suggested by manufacturers, developers, surgeons or other
healthcare professionals. The students need to find a technical solution for a problem
statement for which they have to deliver and present a validated prototype at the end of the
course.

One of those projects was to come up with a protective solution for sharp instruments. This
protective solution, as a product, had to be made from hospital waste. The tips of sharp
instruments are vulnerable and must be protected during transport, handling, cleaning and
sterilization.

A reusable tip protector was to be designed, using recycled polypropylene waste from the
hospital. An additional factor in the design was the recovery of the instrument openers at their
end-of-life, for instance if they wear out or break. A special collection box would enable to
recover the instrument openers in order to reprocess them into granulate in order for the
material to be reused as (new) raw material.

A collaboration was set up between the students, Leiden University Medical Center, the
companies Van Straten Medical and Model Engineering (injection molding) and, an
independent expert in sterile medical devices. A true multi-disciplinary team with experts
from different fields. Blue wrapping paper waste was harvested, melted and recycled into
granulate. 3D prints were made of the tip protector and tested on the CSSDs of Leiden
University Medical Center and CSSD Services. Within 3 months, several workable and
validated models were presented (Figure 1).

The second example concerns a project to recover energy from washing machines at the CSSD.
A series of washing machines (medical thermal disinfectors) at GreenCycl were modified and
used to disinfect medical devices so that they could be reprocessed safely (Figure 2).

                                                                                                                         41
A typical CSSD washing machine washes and disinfects instruments around 90 0C. The water
is discharged into the sewer system after a washing cycle. This is not only a waste of water but
also a waste of energy. The goal of this project was to design and develop a circular process
for the heat recovery. In other words, preventing the heat to be disposed by reusing it for the
next disinfection cycle.

instrument tip protectors designed out of hospital waste. Photo by Bart van Straten.

                                                            42
A team collaboration was set up with students working together with the technicians of Van
Straten Medical, GreenCycl and CSA services. The team was supervised from within the TU-
Delft research line SS&TT, that also streamlined the communication with manufacturers of
thermal washing machines and hospital staff experts.
Thus, there was a large diversity of team members, bringing different perspectives, skills and
experiences. This project shows that initiating this kind of projects within a TU Delft course
appears to foster structured problem identification and solving: every team member learns
from existing evidence-based design structures, in a collaborative mindset that incudes
important communicative aspects such as active listening and constructive feedback. As a
result, a complete infrastructure (Figure 3) was built with smart heat exchanger systems that
could be monitored and controlled from the cloud.
Within this system, the heated water was returned to the boiler where the energy was used
to heat up the next disinfection cycle. Sensors were built in to monitor the process. Ultimately,
this circular system saves 43% on heating per washing and disinfection cycle.

Figure 3. ReoThermia: Reusing heat in waste water after each washing cycle, A collaborative
project between academia, hospitals and the industry. Figure by Tim Horeman.
Both cases reflect the benefits of collaboration between the university, hospitals, industry and
independent experts. The collaborative skills contributed to the success of developing a
circular product within 5 months, driving performance and innovation. In order to solve
difficult waste problems in a complex environment, smart collaborations and sharing of the
findings with others are needed. These insights and best practices can be used in education
and are a potential accelerator for new green processes.

Lessons learned
Designing and setting up a green (dream) team requires group effort and team performance.
During our time working together in this team, it became clear that it is of great importance
to have regular meetings on set days and times. Even if not all team members were able to
join, the meetings took place, because it gives structure to the progress of the project and
highlights its importance among all team members. One of the key success factors was the
drive of the team members, as well as their persuasiveness towards others. Setbacks were
extremely well absorbed and the team just kept going. One person acted as project leader, to
maintain structured team discipline, which turned out to be a critical success factor. The
presence of such a person of strong character increases the chances of success. Furthermore,
there was a continuous focus on achieving collective results. The vision of reducing medical
waste and CO2 emissions through our newly developed process felt as a collective
responsibility. Finally, it is important to include a strong and an experienced visionary to the
steering team (Figure 4) for students and employees to look up to and to follow.

during the course `Medical Device Prototyping', TU Delft. Right: Mr. Drs. Bruno Bruins lecturing

In short, during our studies into circular reprocessing of surgical waste, we experienced an
overwhelming flow of engagement, universal compassion and intrinsic motivation among all
those involved.

Main takeaways of this chapter:
      Developing a circular product, which is embedded in a circular process, requires not
         only design skills but also vision, strategic thinking and communication skills.
      When establishing a green team, it is important to define critical success factors.
      Create a diverse team of specialists and include influential people in the team.
      Share successes with your team members and other stakeholders.

Hospital mining: The operating room as goldmine
                    for raw materials

We have entered an era where we need to reinvent ourselves and develop new technologies
to use raw materials without depleting our natural resources. The reality is that we have been
depleting the earth's natural resources on behalf of our economic wealth too long and too
much. Our economic system is unsustainable in the long run if it keeps relying on the
extraction of natural resources. Therefore, we need to change. In order to transform to a
circular economy, it is necessary to promote awareness for a more sustainable society. We
can achieve this by setting up projects with green teams that serve as an example for others
as a source of inspiration. Urban mining is an important aspect of the circular economy and
plays an essential role as a source of raw materials. In this chapter we investigate how valuable
urban mining can be as a new phenomenon in hospitals.

Urban mining versus conventional mining

Mining of oil, gas, iron ore and other natural resources from underground geologic formations
has taken place for millennia. The significant increase of the world population and global
economic growth, which increased exponentially from the 1970s, resulted in an enormous
increase in the extraction, production and consumption of oil, gas and iron ore. Oil is mainly
found in the USA, Saudi Arabia and Russia; gas in Russia, Iran, Qatar, Turkmenistan, the USA,
Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Iron ore - minerals from which metallic iron is extracted to make steel
- is mined mostly in Australia, followed by Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa and
Ukraine.

The supply of these raw materials thus relies on just a few countries in the world, with a few
extraction locations in each. The supply is easily disrupted, with immediate effects for the rest
of the world, if anything happens to the mines or to the country where the mines are. The
price sensitivity of products made from these raw materials also strongly depends on the
political and economic situation in those countries. In other words, the global economic
system is balancing on a thin thread, being dependent on these few supplying countries. We
saw this most recently with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which led to sanctions
that limited the export of oil and gas from Russia. In the medical sector, we experienced supply
problems in March and April of 2020, when insufficient face masks, made out of polypropylene
which uses oil as a natural resource, were available to protect healthcare staff. The scarcity of
these apparently simple products had a direct impact on public health.

                                                            50
Urban mining is the opposite of conventional mining, since it means harvesting resources not
from underground sources, but from stocks above the ground. Urban mining extracts raw
materials from used products, from buildings or waste.24 Where great amounts of energy are
needed for exploring, extracting, shipping and refining natural resources during conventional
mining, this energy is not needed during urban mining, as the raw materials have already been
extracted. Using medical waste as raw material means using material that has already been
mined, refined and transported over long distances. We can directly mine around us, needing
less energy as compared to conventional mining. Furthermore, waste streams are reduced, as
waste is used as raw material, which is reprocessed.
A major advantage of the circular economy is that urban mining explores aboveground, in
contrast to conventional mines. After all, one of the goals of urban mining is to decrease the
high environmental impact of the exploration, extraction, shipping and refining of virgin raw
materials.24 Furthermore, mining in urban environments can be used as a political strategy
providing resource security and an independent source of raw materials, not impacted by
foreign geopolitical circumstances. Therefore, urban mining is an essential part of the circular
economy and a powerful new way of harvesting the raw materials of the future.
Hospital mining
A hospital can be regarded as an urban mining environment. The medical devices used in a
hospital are typically made out of high-quality raw materials. Since the number of products,
and in particular disposable products, continues to keep growing, this seems an urban mine
with great potential. Hospitals and particularly operating rooms generate waste streams with
valuable materials, which could be mined with less effort and energy, at lower costs and with
a lower environmental impact when compared to geological mining.
The potential depends, amongst other influences, on a number of factors:

      the recyclability of the waste;
      the logistical process to recover and transport the waste;
      the legal possibilities;
      the willingness of stakeholders to co-operate;
      the costs of reprocessing;
      the mechanical properties of the raw material after reprocessing.

Current designs for medical devices are often not sustainable. As discussed above, industrial
design projects were based on mass production, especially because of technological
developments and globalization from the 1980s. Design aimed to produce mass market
volumes with a "design for all" solution.25

Medical devices followed this trend and many were transformed from reusable to disposable
over the years. New technology, such as robot-assisted surgery, was introduced, resulting in
even more disposables which were needed to cover the arms and instruments in the operating
room. All this led to the creation of a massive "plastic soup" emerging from hospitals.
Pandemics such as Covid-19 further stimulated the use of disposables. An 30% increase in
medical plastic waste resulted from the Covid pandemic alone.26 As a result, waste streams
from operating rooms increased even further.

Urban mining would have stimulated those plastic to be made from raw material recovered
as waste from the same hospitals. The quality of hospital waste can be surprisingly high, as
products for hospitals are mostly made from high-quality raw materials. Medical devices
undergo strict medical validations and regulatory approvals. Using waste mined from hospitals
as raw material means that only a small amount of energy is needed to reprocess, as compared
with the amount of energy that is needed to extract natural resources from the earth and the
processing of those resources to raw materials.

Urban mining can be used not only to decrease hospital waste streams and the negative
environmental effects that are associated with those waste streams. It may also have positive
side effects for hospitals, such as reducing the costs they pay to dispose of waste.
Furthermore, urban mining may prevent shortages of available raw materials and secure a
stable supply of medical products. Therefore, urban (hospital) mining seems a promising
method to reprocess waste into new raw material.

However, it is not easy to reduce the use of disposables, since hospital procedures are not
easy to change. Furthermore, there may be more pandemics, making hospitals reluctant to
reuse their waste. Moreover, the transformation of the medical industry from traditional
linear business models to more sustainable circular models needs time. Manufacturers and
suppliers of single-use products, who depend on the sales of disposables, will need time to
reinvent their product and sales strategies.

These companies are subject to risk, however, including the scarcity of raw material, as well
as global geopolitical insecurity, which may lead to increased prices and longer delivery times
for raw materials. Furthermore, there is a global trend towards increased awareness for
sustainability. Thus, from the perspective of industrial ecology, there is no other way than
using circular economy approaches to reduce waste streams, reduce the use of energy and
lower the impact on the environment. Therefore, urban (hospital) mining is expected to
become more important. If standardized methods could be developed for hospital mining and
be made accessible to hospitals, industry partners and other stakeholders all over the world,
we could decrease the risks of supply disruption from other countries. The world would no
longer be dependent on a few countries or mines only.

The operating room as a goldmine for raw materials
Hospitals, and in particular operating rooms, are full of valuable waste. High-value materials
which are commonly not seen are present in the waste containers of hospitals, including
high-quality polymers such polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene (PE),
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ABS.
Blue wrap, surgical gowns and personal protection equipment is made out of PP, while implant
packaging is made out of high-quality PET. Energy-driven complex instruments have handles
made out of ABS. Polymers - which include all plastics - consist of chains of building blocks
called monomers.
The operating room is full of these. These plastics are used mostly in single-use products and
disposed after every medical procedure. These materials are available and ready to be
harvested as above-the-ground stock, without the extraction of gas or oil in far-away
locations. There's no need to refine the extracted natural resources into ethane and propane,
no need for cracking ethane and propane to turn them into ethylene and propylene, and no
need for further processing into polymers.
Another category of raw material is iron-based materials in hospitals, such as disposable
instruments, mostly made of stainless steel type 304 or 316. They are readily available as raw
material when disinfected after use. Stainless steel is a good material to mine in hospitals: it's
easy to melt, no material is lost in the recycling processes and it can be melted over and over
again without losing its material properties.
Furthermore, there are some medical and diagnostic instruments such as ablation catheters
that contain precious metals such as platinum-iridium alloys. These metals are rare and have
a high value, and thus are excellent sources of raw material for new products.
Urban mining of disposed medical products requires a sophisticated logistical process with
protected transportation, disinfection and disassembly possibilities. Medical waste may
consist of multiple types of products, some of which may need to be disassembled before
further processing.
Urban mining can save costs, as well as benefit the environment, but requires extensive
planning. Therefore, it is very important that new medical devices are designed in such a way
that they can be more easily disassembled and reprocessed, with cleaner waste streams.

Main takeaways of this chapter:
      Urban mining is the opposite of conventional mining, since it means harvesting
         resources not from underground but from materials above the ground.
      Urban mining extracts raw materials from used products, from buildings or waste.
      A hospital can be regarded as an urban mining environment. The medical devices used
         in a hospital are made of high-quality materials.
      High-value materials and components which can be mined from hospitals, and
         operating rooms in particular, include polypropylene, PET, PE, polycarbonate, ABS,
         stainless steel types 304 and 316 and platinum.
      Urban mining is an essential part of the circular economy and a powerful new way of
         harvesting the raw materials in the future.

     Turning surgical waste into new products

We have paid a high price for global economic growth. As economies grew, governments
seemed paralyzed to intervene to counteract the negative effects. Despite decades of
scientific evidence, it is striking how few concrete projects are being started to reduce CO2
emissions. Endless debates have taken place about `people, profit, planet', but at the same
time our consumer and industrial society consumed more and more disposables - without any
`waste embarrassment'. In fact, the export of waste became a lucrative business. Western
countries exported waste for money to vulnerable countries. To the west it was out of sight,
at least that's what people thought. Ultimately, we get this waste back in the form of
microplastics and through pollution of the oceans and air.

An important question remains why this degradation of the ecological environment continues
to be allowed. The Covid period seemed to have highlighted that a sense of urgency only exists
for short-term risks, while the longer-term risk of environmental degradation is often ignored.
Many legal guidelines and laws were set aside for Covid, including the need for CE approval
for face masks, while laws that cause a large amount of waste remained in place. As stated
before, laws that do not allow the reprocessing of medical waste are still in place, although
the destruction of our environment in the longer term accrues much higher risks to life than
possible infection through medical waste. Apparently, the perception of sustainability and
circularity is different for short- and long-term risks, not only among the public, but also
among businesses, governments and politicians.

Nevertheless, in the name of science, we started our work. In the European Union, medical
waste from the operating room may not be reused or recycled by law. From plastic packaging
and metal tweezers to stainless steel instruments, everything should be disposed of and
incinerated. This leads to enormous amounts of waste: per surgical procedure, on average
three garbage bags and two containers of waste come out of the operating room. Just the
wrapping paper that contains the instruments used in the operating room adds up to 1.3
million kilos of waste per year in the Netherlands, when waste from all 90 hospitals in the
country is added up. In the Netherlands, up to 50,000 single-use metal instruments are thrown
away per hospital per year.

All medical waste in the Netherlands is brought to Zavin in Dordrecht, where it is incinerated.
When capacity there falls short, it is transported to Belgium. The accumulation of waste and
incineration leads to potential environmental pollution. Despite this, this cycle of extraction
of raw materials, transport, processing, and the obligatory destruction and incineration after
a single use continues to be considered normal. These volumes, however, do provide
opportunities. From the perspective of urban mining, these volumes offer gigantic quantities
of raw materials from which we can make new products. Great capital is destroyed by burning
it, while it is an enormously lucrative basis for future raw materials.

                                                            58
Material behavior
The basis of most medical products is oil or metal. It's a literal waste to burn these materials
when they can be recycled or reused.
Of course, the mechanical properties of recycled waste are important. If we want to make
new products out of medical waste, the material properties determine the usefulness of the
reprocessed material. Therefore, we need to study the material behavior of recycled waste.
The material behavior depends on the relation between stresses and strains in the material.
As described above, we carried out a pilot project at Maasstad Hospital in Rotterdam for
recycling blue wrapping paper. Our project aimed to collect, transport and melt blue wrapping
paper waste from the operating room. During our meetings with the hospital staff, we indeed
noticed a mentality of focusing on what was possible. Legal and operational hurdles were
considered irrelevant and were not on the priority list. Just do it; take action.
What we hoped, but did not know, was that the recovered blue wrap, which is made from
polypropylene, would have characteristics that allowed us to make new products from the
recycled material. Literature studies provided hardly any satisfactory results. We found no
studies in which medical waste was collected from the operating room, reprocessed into raw
material and injection molded into new medical products to be used again.
We decided to concentrate on clean wrapping paper. This wrapping paper is used to wrap
instrument sets before sterilization in the CSSD (Figure 1). The blue wrap ensures that a sterile
barrier protects the instruments, so they remain sterile and can be transported safely.

                                                                                                                         59
Figure 1. Instrument sets wrapped in blue polypropylene, prepared for sterilization. Photo by
Tim Horeman.

Maasstad Hospital uses blue wrap made by the manufacturer Halyard. The sets are
unwrapped in the operating room in a special area, the so-called pre-operative preparation
area. After unwrapping by the OR assistants, the unwrapped sets are transported to the
designated operating room. After use, the blue wrap is disposed of in plastic bags. Since 1.3
million kg of blue wrap is used and disposed of by hospitals in the Netherlands each year, this
is an interesting potential to urban mine.

The energy for making this raw material has already been used during primary production, so
we would only need to use energy to collect and melt the polypropylene. This would partially
- or perhaps completely - level out with the energy needed for transporting and incinerating
the blue wrap.

Therefore, we wanted to make a new medical product out of this material, preferably a
product which could be used again in the same hospital. This would require CE validation,
according to the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The MDR is an EU regulation on
requirements for medical devices. Just like the FDA in the USA, the EU requires technical
documentation including verification and validation of the product and production processes
before it enters the market.

This, we knew, would be hard to achieve, as we wanted to use 100% recycled blue wrap as
the raw material. The CE validation requires technical specifications of the raw materials, our

                                                            60
case we became the raw material supplier as well as the product manufacturer. The raw
material was not purchased as granulate but recycled by us. Our purpose was, furthermore,
to avoid the use of additives, as is usually the case with plastics. Therefore, we conducted
toxicity tests on the material, mechanical tests on the material behavior and we tested the
raw material in a CSSD in worst case conditions in order to build a database with all
specifications.
Additives are added to plastics to enhance the polymer properties and extend their lifetime,
but these potentially harmful chemical substances can be released during the recycling and
melting process.27 The emissions during incineration of plastics can also be dangerous for the
environment. Although additives might be part of the existing blue wrap and its recycled
granulate, we did not want to add additives once the material was melted.
We used a special oven for melting the blue wrap, which we converted to match our
experiments (Figure 2). A KOS electric crucible oven, series 219029, was placed at TU Delft
faculty of Mechanical Engineering. The furnace was fitted with special plating and extraction
to extract the gases from the materials that were melted down. In addition, special
constructions had to be built to melt materials under pressure, but also to be able to cast
materials directly into molds. After modification of the oven, we started the experiment.
Science is a matter of trying, failing and trying again. In other words, persistence is paramount.
Einstein already said `a person who never made a mistake never tried anything new'. With this
in mind, we were ready for the next mistakes and started the pilot in collaboration with
Maasstad Hospital.

Melting, testing and even more testing

The first batch of blue wrap from the operating room was transported to the oven at TU Delft.
The sheets were sorted upon arrival and checked for potential contamination and the
presence of undesired debris.

We started to melt the blue wrap at 200 °C, 250 °C and 300 °C in a stainless steel tube with a
diameter of 100 mm (Figure 5.3). The melted bars were granulated into 8 mm particles
(granules) and injection molded. Injection molding is a technique where the granulate is
heated above its melting point and injected under pressure into a mold. In our case, we used
a mold in the shape of a standardized dog bone. A dog bone (Figure 3) has a standardized
design with two shoulders at both ends and a smaller part in the middle.

A grinding mill was used to granulate the melted bars into small particles. These particles were
used as 100% recycled granulates, and mixed with virgin polypropylene granulate in different
ratios: 75% recycled, 50% recycled and 25% recycled. We did not add additives. One set of dog
bones was made with polluting elements, such as stickers and tape, still in the granulate. The
next step was the injection molding of dog bones from the different mixing ratios. The dog
bones were then tested and compared with each other and with 100% virgin polypropylene.

                                                            62
In order to investigate material behavior, the dog bones are subject to tensile testing. The dog
bone is gripped at each end (this is why the end shoulders are wider than the inner part) in a
tensile test machine and pulled apart until it fails. This is regarded a fundamental test in
materials and engineering science. The ultimate tensile strength, breaking strength, maximum
elongation and reduction in a specific area are derived. Having retrieved this data, properties
can be calculated such as Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio, yield strength and strain-
hardening characteristics.

                                                                                                                         63
Analysis
Tensile strength tests are commonly done to evaluate the mechanical properties of certain
material compositions. We analyzed the Young's Modulus, in other words the stretch ability
or elastic behavior of the material. The Young's Modulus is calculated by relating the strain to
the tension by  = .

                                  

We wanted to know how by much the recycled blue wrap could be stretched, also known as
the elongation at break. This number is displayed as a percentage of its original dimensions.
We also wanted to test how the recycled dog bone would perform regarding ultimate tensile
stress (UTS), i.e. what load the material could bear when stretched before it breaks. These
tests were necessary because we wanted to know if the products made of recycled material
would withstand chemical processes in hospitals.
Medical products, used in the operating room, need to be disinfected and sterilized by the
CSSD of the hospital. Disinfection is typically carried out on 900C using disinfection agents.
Sterilization is done under vacuum in an autoclave on 121 or 134 0C. As these processes may
also influence material behavior, it is important to test the materials by using dog bones which
are treated with these kinds of chemical and thermal cycles.
The test results from the dog bones, molded in the different mixing ratios, showed surprising
outcomes. The values of the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) were all, with the exception of the
polluted mix, above 30 MegaPascal (MPa). One MPa equals one million Pascal (Pa). A Pascal
is one newton of force per square meter, meaning that one MegaPascal is one million newtons
per square meter. A higher MPa means that the material is stronger. The UTS of the recycled
material was 31.5 MPa for the dog bone made out of virgin material, rising to 36.5 MPa for
100% recycled polypropylene (Figures 4 & 5). We considered this a good strength, at least
good enough to justify making new products from this recycled material. On the other hand,
the strain of the dog bone made out of recycled material was 6% lower than for virgin
propylene, meaning it could be stretched 6% percent less. The mechanical properties of the
recycled material appeared to be stronger, stiffer and harder, but also more brittle.23

waste and for potential product designs using recycled surgical waste as source of raw
material.

Designing products out of medical waste: an example
Our goal was to design and make an instrument opener. An instrument opener is used to keep
hinged instruments open during washing and disinfection. These openers are usually made
from stainless steel, an expensive material. It takes a relatively high number of steps to make
an instrument opener from steel, making it too expensive for this kind of application.
Apparently, several hospitals use tile crosses instead, which are bought at hardware stores.
Tile crosses are used to keep tiles in place after they are laid and need to dry. These products
are of course not medical products and certainly not validated or CE-certified. However,
creative solutions must found, given the lack of alternatives - even though these tile crosses
melt around the instrument at higher temperatures.
We designed an instrument opener suitable for different-sized of instruments. The opener
needed to be developed so that a hinged instrument would be kept in an open position at all
times. Just like a car jack, we wanted to create a design that would be suitable for all hinged
instruments. We came up with a design as shown in Figure 7, with a cross at the front and a
solid shape at the back, that fits into an open instrument.

                                                                                                                         67
After designing the instrument opener, a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed (Figure
8). An FEA is a software method which can be carried out using a CAD program. It can be used
to calculate how a product reacts to forces that are applied in daily practice. The FEA is a
simulation in order to determine whether a product will break or wear out, and whether it
works the way it was designed.
The next step was to make injection molds in the shape of the instrument opener. Once the
molds were ready, we used them to injection mold the first series. We made different batches
of instrument openers, from various mix ratios: 100% recycled blue wrap granulate, 75%, 50%,
25% and 10% mix ratios.
The first instrument openers were tested in the CSSD of CSA Services and Maasstad Hospital.
The first results showed that the instrument opener functioned well. This was a good basis to
start writing the CE application according to the MDR.28

opener with the hinge interaction of the opened instrument. The colored areas show the
spots of highest tensile and compression stress.23

The instrument opener was named `Go Jack', a brand name derived from a car jack because it
lifts or pushes apart a hinged object. The letters GO represent GreenCycl, with the O as an
inverted C, because the instrument is made from recycled waste, and thus `green'.
Remarkably, designing Go Jack, milling the molds and injection molding the first 1.000
instrument openers took us just six weeks, while writing and submitting the CE technical
documentation took one year! Despite this long certification period, we were thrilled to have
designed the first surgical product made from 100% recycled surgical waste that obtained an
MDR CE validation.
The packaging of the instrument opener was designed to be made from grass carton, a pulp-
based product which, apart from virgin fiber from wood and recycled paper, contains a
significant proportion of grass fibers. Due to the organic water and grease barriers, packaging
made of grass is primarily used for corrugated cardboard trays for fruit and vegetables. Taking
the Butterfly Diagram in consideration, we had to focus not only on the mechanical recycling
part but also on the biological part, i.e. the left-hand side of the Butterfly Diagram.
Finally, the instrument openers made from recycled PP are recycled again once they reach
their end-of-life after being used in the process for minimal 50 times. We designed a collection
box, made from recycled medical waste, in which they could be deposited after use. Thus,
they could be collected and added to the polypropylene waste flow before being granulated
again and to be used as raw material to make new instrument openers. Maasstad Hospital
became the raw material supplier for its own instrument openers. In our opinion, this example
of a circular business case can be applied to many other products.
The results of this study were published in the Journal for Cleaner Production,23 showing to
the world that surgical waste can be reprocessed into new medical products.

Main takeaways of this chapter:
      The material behavior depends on the relation between stresses and strains in the
         material.
      In order to investigate material behavior, dog bones can be used to perform tensile
         testing. The results regarding the mechanical properties are a good indication in order
         to select which product to make out of recycled materials.
      A grinding mill can be used to granulate melted waste into small particles.
      The concept of circularity can be enhanced by using sustainable packaging, such as
         grass board, for recycled products.

     Reprocessing metal waste from hospitals

The world's crude steel production has grown tremendously since early 2000. The global
hunger for steel needed for buildings and infrastructure, leading to ever-growing economic
wealth, has brought iron ore production to the highest levels in history. Iron ore is mined as
rocks and minerals from which metallic iron is extracted in order to produce steel.
The use of steel products has also grown exponentially in hospitals in the last decades. Many
small surgical procedures are now carried out with disposable stainless steel instruments,
although they had always been performed with reusable instruments in the past.
Disposable stainless steel instruments such as needle holders, tweezers and scissors are used
in hospitals in many departments. Single use is presented as cheap. Disposable instruments
are always sterile, as the supplier supplies each instrument in single packaging, do not have to
be cleaned and re-sterilized. The numbers of single-use instruments used grew significantly,
as environmental impact considerations did not play any role.29 Apparently, we used to favor
luxury over sustainability. Nowadays, many hospitals are using over 50,000 disposable
stainless steel instruments per year, which are, moreover, flown in from production locations
around the world. They are used only once, and then immediately disposed and incinerated,
so that enormous amounts of metal were disposed on a daily basis by hospitals. However, at
the same time there is increasing scarcity of iron ore as a natural resource.
It is important to note that there is a distinction between ferrous and non-ferrous metal types.
Ferrous metals contain iron; non-ferrous metals do not contain iron, at least not in in
appreciable amounts. Basically, non-ferrous metals are non-magnetic (due to the absence of
iron), they are highly resistant to corrosion, and they do not rust - that's why copper pipes are
often used in corrosive environments - but they have a lower tensile strength and durability
than ferrous metals.

The research group of the authors decided to see if it was possible to collect, recycle and use
metal-based waste and use it as raw material for new medical products or components. There
were hardly any studies to be found in the literature which described the reprocessing of
metal surgical waste into raw material used as input for new medical products.
This seemed a perfect starting point for a study; the next step was selecting a medical device
that we wanted to recycle. Preferably, it would be an instrument that was used in the
operating room in large numbers. An anesthesiologist from the Amsterdam University Medical
Center drew our attention by pointing out that his hospital used disposable laryngoscope
blades, although there is also a type of blade available that is reusable. Laryngoscope blades
are used in high quantities to intubate patients before surgery, but the anesthesiology
department could not prevent the hospital from purchasing disposables. The type of
laryngoscope blade used in this hospital was made of Zamak.
Zamak is a lesser-known, non-ferrous metal. The initials of the name Zamak stand for the four
main components Zinc, Aluminium, Magnesium and Copper (using the German spelling K for
Kupfer). It's a very useful material with good physical and mechanical properties that is used
in jewelry lines but also in the car and furniture industry, where it is used for door handles and
decorative strips. In short, it a high-quality material with casting potential.
The Amsterdam University Medical Center used and disposed 7,000 of these blades per year
(Figure 1). If the hospital were to use a reusable version, it would only need a few hundred. It
seemed we had found our product: a medical device made out of a high-quality material,
consumed by hospitals on a daily basis, with high costs to have them collected and disposed.
The supplier of the product, a US-based company, manufactures these blades in China and
sells them around the world. The company had already seen a rise in hospitals asking for its
sustainability agenda. We agreed with this supplier that it would support us in setting up
recovery programs with hospitals to collect the blades after use.

                                                                                                                         73
Virgin Zamak has a melting temperature of 390 0C. After melting and during solidification, the
material tends to shrink, which is known as solidification shrinkage and occurs as the alloy
changes from a liquid to a solid. The solidification shrinkage of Zamak is 1.2 %. This is an
important aspect when casting products, as it can lead to weaknesses in the material. Zamak
has an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 280 Mega Pascal (MPa), which makes it roughly seven
times stronger than polypropylene and approximately 2.2 less strong than stainless steel.
Zamak has a yield strength of 210 MPa. After this point the material will deform and not return
to its original state. The Young's modulus, a measurement of stiffness, is 86 GPa. A low Young's
modulus value means a material is elastic. A high Young's modulus value means a material is
inelastic or stiff. The Elongation at break of Zamak - the measurement of how much the
material can be stretched - is 11 %.
It was interesting to find out what the properties would be when we would melt blades which
are used in the operating room. We wanted to find out whether we could recycle disposable
Zamak laryngoscope blades into new medical products by using a new "all-in-one" affordable
reprocessing setup as alternative for the common Zamak die-casting.
In total 48 kg of disposable Zamak laryngoscope blades were collected as waste from two
hospitals: Spaarne Hospital, Hoofddorp, and Amsterdam University Medical Center,
Amsterdam. The operating room team placed the waste in special plastic containers with a
lockable lid.
After receipt of the containers, we opened and disinfected the laryngoscope blades at 90 0C.
The easiest set-up was to make a stainless steel bowl with a funnel and a mold underneath
the funnel (Figure 2). The whole set-up could be placed in the melting oven. The set-up was
made from stainless steel, as this type of steel has a melting temperature of 1.400 0C or higher,
far above the melting point of Zamak.

machine. Middle: the melting oven. Right: the casting set-up. Photo by Bart van Straten.

                                                            74
The laryngoscope blades are coated with an epoxy-polyester coating which had to be
removed. The bake-off method can be used in these situations to turn the coating layer into
ashes. This method requires a temperature of 340 0C to 400 0C,30 when the coating starts
flaking and forming cracks. The aim was for the Zamak to flow into the mold once the coating
degraded enough.
A temperature of 420 0C seemed to be the best melting temperature to reduce the oxidation
rate. Oxidation leads to gases and debris, which in turn can be absorbed by the liquefied
Zamak. This may create defects and porosity during casting, which may lead to weaknesses in
the cast material. This may result in lower ultimate tensile stress and yield strength and a
lower Young's modulus. As a result, the material could break more easily.
During casting the melted material decreases in volume when it solidifies; i.e. the casting
shrinks. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that particles are pulled into the
direction where the solidification starts. It tends to start at the walls of the mold, as this area
cools down first. As a result, holes may appear in the material if there is not enough melt
available to compensate for the loss of volume. This is called shrinkage porosity31 and should
be prevented.
To prevent shrinkage porosity, we chose to design the mold with a riser. A riser is an extra
space on top of the mold, functioning as a reservoir in which more cast Zamak accumulates.
The melted Zamak in the riser solidifies last, meaning that the material in the mold pulls liquid
Zamak material from the riser towards the areas where cavities emerge.
An "all-in-one" melting process takes three hours' melting time and another hour to be sure
that the cast material has cooled down.

The recycled material showed a recovery rate of 93% and looked like a bar of silver after
opening the oven. The standard machining experiments showed the cast Zamak material
could be machined easily with standard equipment with standard mechanical properties
(Figure 3).

The wisdom lies in measurement
An X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF spectroscopy) on the recycled Zamak was carried out. This
is a method to determine the elemental composition of materials, i.e. to look at the material
on an atomic level. The XRF analysis measurements were performed with a Panalytical Axios
Max WD-XRF spectrometer at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at TU
Delft. The results were remarkable. Our relatively simple "all-in-one" melting and casting set-
up led to good recycling results. Although there were some impurities, the material mainly
contained Zinc, as Zamak is supposed to have. The concentrations of Zinc and silicon found in
the cast material were higher than in virgin Zamak. The silicon likely came from the plastic
parts of the laryngoscope blades which were not removed before melting. The tested samples
had a purity of 99.7% and we saw no porosities in the cast material. The riser did its job: it
prevented gas and shrinkage porosity and the casting temperature of 4200C appeared to be a
good temperature for the "all-in-one" recycling set-up.
The second step was to make dog bones out of the recycled cast Zamak in order to determine
the ultimate tensile strength, the yield point and the Young's modulus. While the UTS
determines the maximum stress that a material can withstand, the yield strength is often used
to determine the maximum allowable load on a mechanical component. It represents the
upper limit to forces that can be applied without causing permanent deformation (which is
also called the plastic deformation region). Engineers use yield strength when designing
products, as it keeps products safe from failure when the maximum load stays below the yield
strength. The yield strength is a constant that represents the maximum limit of elastic
behavior (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Elastic and plastic behavior of material, ultimate tensile stress and yield stress.

                                                                                                                         77
Dog bones made from the cast material (Figure 5) were used to perform mechanical tensile
tests. The average UTS of the recycled Zamak laryngoscope blades appeared to be 236 ±61
(MPa) as compared to 280 MPa for virgin Zamak. The average YS of the recycled Zamak was
70 MPa compared to 210 MPa for virgin Zamak. Although the UTS as well as the YS are lower
than virgin Zamak, the strength of the recycled Zamak was sufficient to work with.

After obtaining the results of the tensile testing, the casting of steering wheels was prepared,
to design as part of the handle of a medical instrument used for laparoscopy as explained in
Chapter 8.32 A stainless steel mold was made to cast these wheels.

The casting of the steering wheel was successful. It smoothly released from the mold and there
were no damages on the surface. We observed shrinkage of the material, as is common with
casting. This varied between 0.0% and 1.2%, which was acceptable. The steering wheel, cast
out of recycled Zamak, was assembled on the SATA instrument and tested (Figure 6). Thus,
like with the instrument opener made from blue wrap, we managed to make a new
component from Zamak waste. In short, we succeeded in making reusable components out of
disposable products.

Despite the limitations and changing mechanical properties, the results indicated that is
feasible to reprocess disposed medical instruments into usable raw material and new medical
parts.33
Reducing waste within the circular economy can be done in different ways. Changing from the
use of disposable instruments to reusable instruments in order to reduce medical waste is a
good option to consider when setting up circular strategies. After all, keeping products and
materials in circulation instead of disposing them is the objective of the circular economy.
These circular strategies help to reduce CO2 emissions and contribute to a circular healthcare
economy. Another option, apart from the recycling of non-ferrous metals such as Zamak, is
the recycling of ferrous metals (Chapter 7), which clearly has benefits for the environment. It
results in less extraction of raw materials from the earth and helps to reduce carbon emissions.

Main takeaways of this chapter:
      Iron ore is mined as rocks and minerals, from which metallic iron is extracted in order
         to produce steel.
      Large amounts of metal are discarded in hospitals on a daily basis.
      Recycling of ferrous and non-ferrous metals has benefits for the environment. It
         means less extraction of raw materials from the earth and helps to reduce carbon
         emissions.
      There are two types of metal: ferrous and non-ferrous. Zamak is a little-known, non-
         ferrous metal. The name Zamak stands for the four main components Zinc, Aluminum,
         Magnesium and Copper. Like other metals, Zamak is recyclable.
      A temperature of 420 0C seems the best melting temperature for Zamak, in order to
         reduce the oxidation rate. Oxidation leads to gases and debris, which in turn can be
         absorbed by the liquefied Zamak. At this temperature the coating is removed, called
         the `bake-off method'. The molten material turned out to be good raw material for
         making new products.

          Climate change as a business case

The circular economy is gaining more and more interest around the world, meaning that it can
be considered as a growing business model. Circular business models aim to reduce the
extraction and use of natural resources and to prevent waste streams. They represent the
transition to a sustainable economy. But to change from a traditional model to a circular
model, courage, vision and risk-taking are needed.

Some visionaries may be regarded as dreamers, but their vision says what their business will
look like in the future. They present a clear image combined with passion and perseverance.
Despite many objections and obstacles, they continue. And then there are the followers: those
who join in if it turns out that the market is indeed moving in the direction the visionaries
foresaw. The more people, organizations, politicians and policymakers join the circular vision,
the faster the transition will take place. Sustainability has now grown into profitability. If you
are not sustainable, you will no longer be relevant. This also increasingly applies to hospitals.

As we have seen in chapter 1, the global growth of medical waste has been the result of the
growing global population. Also of the growing number and size of hospitals as well as the
increase in use of disposable products resulted in growing waste streams.34 Some studies
report that up to 8.4 kg of waste is generated per patient per day.35 Roughly 5.9 million tons
of hazardous waste (15% of the total) and non-hazardous medical waste (85% of the total), is
disposed by USA hospitals each year.36 Hospitals in the USA account for 8% of the total CO2
emissions in the USA,37 which equals the emissions by hospitals in all EU countries, including
the Netherlands.

The challenge is to use these environmental damaging aspects to set-up an evidence-based
way to growing new successful circular initiatives, using commitment, resources, knowledge,
and confidence as ingredients for success.

For our study, we investigated the feasibility of reusing medical instruments and stainless steel
extracted out of hospital waste streams. We wanted to study not only the technical and
logistical aspects of recycling, but also to see whether recycling of hospital waste could
constitute a positive business case. After all, the circular economy is increasingly becoming a
suitable business model in a market where the demand for sustainability is growing. This
would mean that an attractive proposition would have to be formulated for hospitals. Our
research question for the business case part of this study38 aimed to investigate if financial
benefits for hospitals could be realized by applying circular strategies: Can cost savings be
realized when using repair, refurbishing and recycling as methods to reach a concept of closing
the circular loop in a hospital environment?
During the last decades, various business models have emerged, such as e-commerce
business, pay-per-use, open-source applications, shared concepts and environmentally-
friendly business models. Circular business models will be the next big step and may be seen
as a disruptive model in some cases. Disruptive innovation creates new markets and might
eventually displace established market-leading firms.
A circular business model applies circular economy principles, where products and processes
are designed for reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling. The European
Commission supports the transition from linear to circular by the establishment of a "right to
repair". For now, this "right to repair" only applies to products in the consumer market. It
means that consumers will have the right to ask for the repair of products, also after the
warranty period, as this results in lower costs, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and less energy
consumption. Despite the fact that it might take a while before this also applies to the business
market, it is a good example for suppliers of medical devices. In fact, it may serve as an
example for manufacturers to take social responsibility and a good starting point for new
sustainable and circular business models: `climate change as a business case'.

Particularly for stainless steel there is a good business case to make for reuse. Disposed
instruments and stainless steel medical waste consist of valuable materials, which can be
reused. They have a good resistance against corrosion, especially medical and surgical
instruments. Stainless steel consists of iron (Fe)-based alloys, containing Chromium (Cr),
Nickel (Ni), Molybdenum (Mo), carbon and silicon.
Surgical instruments are mostly made of stainless steel type 316 (SS316). Stainless steel type
304 (SS304) is typically used for disposable instruments and instrument transport mesh
baskets. Stainless steel has a 100 percent recyclability and has good properties after melting.
Stainless steel products should therefore never become waste at the end of their useful life.
Instead, they should be structurally separated, melted and led back into the manufacturing of
new products.
Our experiment was focused on collecting stainless steel waste from hospitals, which
consisted of disposed single-use instruments (Figure 1) and other disposed stainless steel
waste such as mesh baskets and other accessories. Three Dutch hospitals were included in the
study: Haaglanden MC in The Hague, Maasstad Hospital in Rotterdam, and Amsterdam
University Medical Center (AUMC, location VUmc).

Methods

The business case started with collecting discarded reusable and disposable instruments and
other stainless steel waste from the operation rooms during a period of 6 months (25
September 2018 - 12 February 2019). We used the facilities at our company Van Straten
Medical in De Meern-Utrecht, the Netherlands, which is equipped for processing and repairing
medical instruments.

The collected waste was disinfected at the supplying hospital sites in disinfectors using
standardized disinfection programs at 90 °C. The waste consisted of several stainless steel
waste streams, including used disposable instruments which were disinfected in a thermal
disinfector which was acquired second-hand.

We contacted a metal recycling company that collected the recyclable stainless steel material
from our facility, after disinfection by us. This company melted the materials into new sheet
metal. We then transported the sheet metal from the company and used it to manufacture
new components, mainly mesh baskets and other stainless steel components needed to
create instrument mesh baskets. The sheet metal plates were processed on a water jet cutting
machine to cut the components for the mesh baskets.

The retrieved instruments were absorbed in the mass of metal, making it impossible to
determine whether the collected plates contained any old instruments. Nevertheless, we
considered this a circular loop, as no material waste was generated during the process.

In this business case we decided to focus on the savings that hospitals make by not having to
pay waste disposal costs, which vary per hospital. The costs for hospital waste collection by a
waste processing company hospitals consists of a price per kg waste, plus costs for use of
special waste containers, consultancy and handling costs. Furthermore, we created revenues
and value through reprocessing hospital metal waste.

Our costs included costs for electricity, costs for overhead and transportation costs, costs of
repair and parts that were needed to repair and remanufacture old instruments into
instruments in `new manufacturing's condition', which equates to the quality of new products.
The revenues were aimed at getting a price per kg for the recycled instruments as well as
charging a price for instruments which could be repaired. This led to further savings for the
participating hospitals, because repairing these instruments was much cheaper than buying
them new. The instruments which could not be repaired because of too much damage were
recycled, for which we received a revenue per kg. The melting of the steel was done via a steel
manufacturer who offer a price per kg. Stainless steel revenues are dependent on the current
market price for stainless steel and vary per period. However, due to geopolitical
circumstances at the time of this study, the raw material prices (and supplying times) for
stainless steel were increasing.

                                                            88
In this study, the focus was on three main cost cycles in hospitals with regard to stainless steel
waste:
(1) Disposed instruments, which could be repaired. The price of repair was compared with the
price of a new instrument.
(2) The revenues from recycling stainless steel instruments which could not be repaired.
(3) Savings of costs for waste handling, which the hospitals no longer had to pay since we
collected the waste.
All costs were related to units equivalent to 1,000 kg (ton).
Results
During our experiment we collected a total of 1,380 kg waste from the three participating
hospitals. The waste consisted of all kinds of different instruments, ranging from instruments
used for basic surgery to instruments used for specialized surgery (Figure 2). Furthermore,
stainless steel trays and mesh baskets were collected. Twenty percent of the collected waste
consisted of instruments that could be repaired.

A total of 50 kg consisted of disposable instruments which had been used only once. These
were collected in a closed container, as they had to be disinfected first before they could be
used. The other 1,330 kg consisted of reusable instruments disposed for various reasons, and
disposed mesh baskets (Table 1). From this, 20% (approximately 266 kg) seemed to be
repairable, meaning that they could be processed into "new manufacturing condition" after
refurbishment. All stainless steel instruments and mesh baskets consisted of stainless steel
types 316 and 304. If the instruments could not be repaired, the steel was melted and recycled
into sheet material. The total amount of waste per hospital category is provided in Table 2.
The distribution per type of waste (refurbished and recycled) per hospital is provided in Table

In total, 945 instruments were repaired and refurbished into new manufacturing condition:
282 instruments from Maasstad Hospital, 478 from Haaglanden MC and 185 from VUmc. The
average weight of each instrument was 251 g, adding up to 237 kg in total.

The revenues of collecting one kg of metal waste which was recycled at the market price for
stainless steel appeared higher than the costs to collect, disinfect and handling, leading to a
positive business case (Table 4).

The revenues in the business case were further increased by the 237 kg of collected
instruments which could be refurbished. The savings for the hospitals are shown in Table 5.,
as compared to the costs of replacing them with new instruments.

The average costs of refurbishment were  39 per 250 g. The average sales price of a new
instrument was estimated at  80, based on the average sales price of a total of 16,912 medical
instruments available in the market, gathered from price lists at Van Straten Medical. For the
business case this meant a saving of  41 per instrument ( 164 per kg) for the hospital and 
39 in turnover per instrument for those selling it. It goes without saying that a facility is
required where instrument repairs can be carried out in accordance with medical
requirements. Furthermore, this business case is focused only on cost savings and positive
returns, not on CO2 savings.

Climate change as a business case

The world needs sustainable solutions. Our economic systems will have to change from linear
to circular. Growing market demands for circular products and services will support this
change. Activist shareholders are increasingly pushing for environmental change. Corporate
Social Responsibility programs are emerging as management concepts to offer
environmentally-friendly products and services. In short, sustainability sells. Many companies
realize that if they don't come up with sustainable solutions, they will miss out on market
demand, as they are challenged by individuals and organizations who are intrinsically
motivated to take action to save ecosystems, but do not financially gain from their actions.
The business case outlined in this chapter shows that there is a financial incentive for hospitals
to participate in the circular economy and that it is possible for new business models to
emerge.

Healthcare waste demonstrated to have negative impacts on the environment, which may be
limited by handling waste in a circular way.39 This business case showed that instruments for
general surgery and specialized surgery can be repaired and brought back into circulation. The
costs associated with repair and refurbishment amounted to 49% of the average purchase
(replacement) costs. Such business cases could also be set up for other products used in
hospitals which are normally not recycled. Circular projects such as this study are generally
received with enthusiasm by hospital staff and provide new insights into the potential
reusability of medical waste.

A circular business case can be made from different perspectives. From a business perspective,
the circular economy can maximize profits or point to new products or markets. From the
perspective of a hospital, it is profitable to save costs, and enables the hospital to set up a
green agenda. A persuasive circular proposal describes a clear definition of the problem and
the solution. A strong proposal allows decision-makers to make a decision based on the
benefits, disadvantages, costs, risks of the current situation and the future vision.
The Butterfly Diagram can be used as a basis for a circular proposal by prioritizing the inner
loops over the outer loops (share/maintain/repair - reuse/redistribute -
refurbish/remanufacturing - recycling). The loops as shown in Figure 3 represent cost savings
to hospitals and businesses. They make keep products and materials in circulation, rather than
purchasing new products.40 Our experiment emphasized the importance of the repair and
recycling strategies in the Butterfly Diagram.

loop shows increased costs and energy usage. Source: the Ellen MacArthur Foundation,
modified by Tim Horeman.
In short, climate change as a business case can result in cost savings for hospitals and generate
revenues for businesses at the same time. Using waste as source of income and as a source of
raw material to make new products as circular strategies can create new business models.
Even more important is that we use these new business models to stop the degradation of
our planet.

Main takeaways of this chapter:
      The circular economy faces growing interest around the world, meaning it can be
         considered a profitable business model.
      Circular business models aim to reduce the extraction and use of natural resources
         and to prevent waste streams. They represent the transition to a sustainable
         economy.
      Climate change as a business case can lead to improved protection of our ecosystems.
      The Butterfly Diagram can be used as a basis for a circular proposal by prioritizing the
         inner loops over the outer loops, i.e. focusing on share, maintain, repair and reuse,
         rather than refurbish and recycle.
      The loops of the Butterfly Diagram represent cost savings to hospitals and businesses.
         They can make use of products and materials already in circulation, rather than
         investing in making or buying them new.
      Waste can be used as a source of income and as a source of raw material to make new
         products.

     Eliminating waste by design: A Design by
   Dissection - Component Interaction analysis

                         (DD-CIA)

Engineering design for a circular economy means a fundamentally different way of developing
and producing products and services. As the circular economy is gaining more and more
interest, we will see the emergence of new technologies and waste-preventing products and
services like the initiative of GreenCycl to design waste into products (Figure 1). Engineering
is about solving problems. Not only engineers, but all other stakeholders in the circular
economy can have a significant impact on sustainable development. Basically, anyone who
helps to engineer a circular product or service helps to create a better world.
Circular engineering principles can be seen as engineering principles that are aligned with the
principles of the circular economy. They harmonize the engineering principles "ideas and
concepts that are used to solve an engineering problem" with the circular economy principles
as defined by the Ellen McArthur Foundation: 32 designs which eliminate waste and pollution,
circulate products and materials and regenerate nature.
Circular engineering principles can be applied in product design and in process design, by using
design requirements for the circular strategies of sharing, maintenance, reuse, repair,
remanufacturing and recycling. Thus, a circular product is created, which requires designing
towards zero waste. In other words: products, components and materials continue to circulate
in the economy.

Taking the circular loops of the Butterfly Diagram into consideration, we can aim to design
products in a different way than traditional products. This means designing them to last longer
and to be re-used, by:

     Choosing high-quality and strong materials that prolong durability.
     Minimalistic design, with fewer parts, preferably using the same materials for all parts,

         and less complexity.
     Facilitating ease of maintenance and repair, for instance by limiting the number of

         steps that is needed to access parts that must be replaced, and by ensuring that few
         tools are needed - ideally no tools at all, but in any case standard tools that are easy
         to find.
     Using recycled materials.
     Standardizing parts and lubricants.
     Simple modular design, with replaceable modules.
     Making the product easy to clean and avoiding small holes or cavities where dirt can
         accumulate.
     In the choice of materials, making sure that all parts are able to withstand the same
         detergents and temperatures.
     Making heavily used surfaces able to withstand mechanical cleaning.
     Making the product easy to disassemble (non-destructive), e.g. by limiting the use of
         glue.
     Making it easy to replace components that wear out or can easily break, such as tires.
     Designing reusable or bio-based (degradable) packaging.

Processes

Besides products, processes can also help to become more circular by:
     Providing a repair service to the customers (thereby creating revenue and ensuring
         satisfied customers).
     Sales of spare parts and spare parts kits.
     Providing a market distinction for products that are easy to repair.
     Collecting packaging after use in an exchange process.
     Collecting products at the end of life and reprocess or recycle.
     Pay-per-use service.
     Good, easy-to-find online documentation for maintenance, repair and disassembly.
     Eco-friendly transportation of the product.

                                                                                                                         97
The level of circularity maybe determined by the environmental impact an object or process
has on the environment.
In the previous chapters mainly strategies related to existing product designs were discussed.
We learned how material choices and component structures have their influence on the
functionality as well as on the cleaning of the device and its life cycle.41
However, an assembled complex product or device can be seen as the result of an extensive
design process in which essential decisions are made regarding the looks, feel and functioning
of a device and their interrelations.
Therefore, it makes sense that sustainability requirements have a tremendous influence on
the eventual footprint of a device and should be dealt with on a higher design level.

The design and manufacturing methods of surgical products have a large influence on the
complexity of the design and thus on energy consumption and sustainability. Therefore, a
smart design approach with focus on well-embedded and integrated functionality can help to
make a "greener" product. Particularly in the field of surgery, the conventional approach,
namely to design multifunctional surgical devices, often means that complex instruments are
designed, with many components.

These devices are sometimes difficult to use in the operating room or to handle on the CSSD
department. A redesign is needed in this case to improve functionality or ease of use. In many
cases, redesign is needed due to changes in legislation, procedures, finances or use, although
there is nothing wrong with the devices' primary function.

Conventional design approaches

In 1993, a V-model was initially published by Bröhl42 for the structured development of
software applications; this found its way into the development of technical systems.43
Thereafter, the model was further developed for mechatronic systems in the VDI guideline
2206 by Gausemeier and Moehringer in 2002 (Figure 1).44

In general, all models that are based on this structure are divided into three main components:
the system design, the domain-specific design and the system integration. The input to the
system design component consists of the requirements of the product to be designed. These
requirements are defined after the problem analysis and after breaking down the goal of the
design problem to be solved.

These input requirements also represent what the final product needs to achieve. The design
process contains verification steps that allow the user to make changes to either the required
characteristics of the future product, the details of the sub-functions or the requirements.45
In the domain-specific phase, the selected solution concept is worked out in detail with the
necessary calculations of the elaborated design, followed by a comprehensive functional
performance that is presented with respect to the most critical functions. In the system
integration part of the process, the results are integrated regarding various domains. Using
the validation process, the specified solution is checked against the requirements defined in
the beginning. This is done to make sure that the obtained characteristics of the final product
are the desired ones. The result of this phase at the end of the system integration process is
the final concept or product.

Specific design methods and

guidelines exist that can help

designers to create surgical devices

that meet the broad requirements

of all stakeholders while taking

recycling and reprocessing at the

end-of-life into account. For

assessment of a device

development both Barbero and

Pereno et al. used three

assessment methods: 1. the

disassembly analysis, 2. the

accessibility analysis and 3. the

input-output  analysis.46

Disassembly analyses are shown to

be useful for healthcare              Figure1. V-shaped models show the steps that should be

researcher to fully understanding

the equipment, identifying components that are easy or difficult to disassemble and defining

the material composition of the equipment, in order to understand the ease of separation of

different materials at the end-of-life.45 The accessibility and interaction analysis is useful to

get insight into, for example, the ease of maintenance. Barbero and Pereno et al. highlight the

importance of showing ease of access for different users, like maintenance technicians,

healthcare staff and patients or, in case of surgical instruments, CSSD workers, technicians and

waste processors. The guidelines of Pereno et al. for Complex Handheld Surgical Devices

(CHSD) and circular design are related to narrowing, slowing down and closing the design

development loop. They suggest how to promote circular design in the categories information

communication, product life cycle, usability, technology embedding and flexibility in use.47

Romli et al. 2015 suggest that inspiration for redesign ideas can be gathered from other
instruments, in order to prevent spending unnecessary time in finding already-existing
solutions for a problem.48 Koppella et al. 2013 present a method for redesigning the product
architecture for improved critical part retrieval for reuse with two medical devices as case
study.49 Regarding the end-of-life, the work of Kane et al. describes design guidelines based
on value and criticality that help choose the best strategy.50 These results show that a
throughout systematic analysis of the current design with interacting components is essential
before any circular strategy can be proposed.

Based on the relatively high value and high criticality of CHSD, reprocessing is advised as the
best recycling strategy. When the device can no longer be reused due to for example
functional or regulatory obsolescence, then recycling is presented as the final end-of-life
option. Kumar 2020 indicates "design for" strategies that make possible the recovery of
materials, with a strong focus on specific design guidelines for the cleaning process of surgical
devices.51
This work describes the importance of identify potential economic barriers throughout the
design process. Moreover, it suggests to take regulations into considerations, as these give
practical barriers for certain recovery strategies. Especially regulations linked to
decontamination can cause a well-designed part, that can be easily reprocessed and reused,
to end up as incineration or landfill part (Figure 2). Ferraresi et al. 2014 suggest to ensure
differentiation of materials and to use compatible materials.52
Moultrie et al. 2015 implement circular design in the early stage of the design process. Hanson
& Hitchcock 2009 suggest to use circular assessment tools to set up appropriate redesign
requirements based on a thorough understanding of the device and to integrate circularity
throughout the design process. Mann et al. 2018 emphasize that we should not forget the
practicality and feasibility of sustainable design,53 while Beeftink et al. 2019 show that the
normal design process can still be used, with a circular aspect integrated within each phase in
order to keep the process orderly and lean.54 Finally Barbero et al. 2017 suggest that it is
preferable to change the device as little as possible from current designs, as every change
requires new medical testing and approval.55

Design by Dissection-Component Interaction Analysis

Due to the complex nature of surgical procedures and the limited time the surgical staff has
to elaborate on the problem, it is likely that essential information is missed or misinterpreted
by the development team. Moreover, it should be understood that the way a surgical team
performs a surgical procedure highly depends on the knowledge of the surgeon. Therefore,
the skills and surgical approach depend on where and how a surgeon was educated and can
differ highly between hospitals. Finally, financial pressure often dictates surgeons to work long
hours on an irregular basis, leaving them with less time to fully explore the problem that needs
to be solved or to investigate whether potential solutions exist. Therefore, a methodology is
needed to overcome these limitations and prevent that the obtained information is too
limited or too subjective when solving a problem with surgical devices.

Minimalistic design

Winter et al. found that, to gain acceptance of a technical innovation at a low-resource setting,
a different design approach is required that fosters the development of intuitive and
maintenance-friendly devices.56 Although the focus of Winter et al. was on low-resource
settings, his suggestion is important: to find ways to reduce complexity by actively looking for
alternative technology or mechanisms within the device without changing its basic functioning
as soon as the cost price becomes too expensive. Due to the additional requirements the
context of surgery brings to surgical technology design, in combination with the desire to keep
the mental load during device interaction to a minimum, the design of surgical technology is
challenging.

Within the synergy phase of the design process, the morphological chart (Figure 3) is often
used to split the design of a device into partial sub-functions. For each of these sub-functions
potential solutions are found that can all be combined into feasible concepts. Depending on
the source, these concepts are translated into "proof of concepts" and assessed based on a
set of criteria with the help of an assessment matrix such as the "Harris Profile".57 Although
this is a very structural way to create a design out of existing elements, it is doubtful whether
this method motivates designers to create a fully integrated system, instead of ways to
combine existing ones into a functional prototype by the use of additional supporting
structures or components. It is possible to increase awareness for the importance of having
an integrated design when combining the sub solutions with a specific mindset (e.g. most
affordable, most comfortable or fastest developing time etc.) into desirable concepts. To
further motivate designers to redesign surgical devices to better fit a new context or to solve
a functional problem, a new approach is presented to investigate the problem on a
component level and to remove problem-causing components from the device without
compromising its function.

Many papers that contain design methods and guidelines for surgical devices focus on specific
improvements within the design process. Valuable examples are suggestions like "optimize
the volume and shape", "improve the affordability of the product", "design the product so it
can be easily customized and renewed without substantially changing the production
processes" or "optimize the internal layout of components". However, specific "how to"
examples are limited to specific aspects, e.g. the type of material to use, based on its chemical
resistance or other properties, or how to make a design modular. Therefore, this study will
provide a concrete methodology that allows designers to redesign surgical devices that fit
better in the complexity of the operating room.

To help new designers to create smarter instruments, the "Design by Dissection (DD)"
methodology has a strong focus on Component Interaction Analysis (CIA) in combination with
a step-by-step development and evaluation plan. This development and evaluation plan
involves all key users who are relevant to the innovation to create lean functional medical
devices. To show its potential, this new methodology is validated below by examples that
show how the design was influenced in a concrete way.

                                                           104
Fewer parts with more functions
In many cases, problems related to surgical devices can be related to a single type of critical
component. The DD-CIA approach helps the designer to identify these critical components
linked to a function. By removing the failing components from the design, designers are forced
to think of ways to alter the remaining parts so that they take over the functions of the
removed parts. CIA requires the designer to think about all functions the instrument needs to
fulfil in terms of energy transmission through the device. Input of energy provided on one side
of the device needs to result in output on the other side of the device and vice versa. This type
of communication is often facilitated by physical components that have additional tasks, such
as providing structure to the system. In addition, these components should also facilitate
cleaning and therefore allow for easy disassembly and re-assembly. Furthermore, they should
be easy to clean in a sometimes hostile environment for surgical devices with high
temperature differences and aggressive chemicals. This generally means that medical or
surgical devices benefit from a strong reduction in communicating components.
The DD-CIA method adds to the execution of any standard design process and expands the
investigational and constructional phases. The holistic DD-CIA methodology can be integrated
in the Design-by-Dissection problem identification method as shown in Figure 4. The Design-
by-Dissection method was created to help researchers who develop surgical devices to fully
understand the problem of the surgeon or surgical team and to develop devices in a
minimalistic way.

                                                                                                                       105

Figure 4. Flow chart for a Design by Dissection and implementation of medical or surgical
devices. Figure by Tim Horeman.

In the investigational phase, the current situation of failing equipment is analyzed in step 1.
This table shows functional component(s) that cause problems and allows the designer to
check if alternative components fit better in the context and can be better aligned with the
energy transmissions in the remaining components during the overall functioning of the
system. In the synergy phase (step 2), the components are identified that are related to the
problematic procedural steps, and which should be avoided when meeting the overall device
requirements for ease of use or cleaning.
In step 3, alternative solutions are presented that can be integrated without compromising
the functioning of the device. These solutions contain identified alternative or hybrid
(modified) components that always aim to reduce complexity. In this step it should be taken
into account that energy transmission inside the components of the device (like a certain
component motion or force build-up) can be used as input for any of the functions that require
a physical action (e.g. decoupling/coupling, monitoring of force/motion or physical state).

                                                           106
The flow as shown in Figure 4 is used to determine all relevant interaction forces, component
motions and other energy transmissions. All interactions between components and
environment needed for primary functioning, but also secondary use should be included. A
structured identification method based on energy flow definitions is created, as shown in
Table 1. This Table was fully explained for the first practical example within the model
validation paragraph.

Model validation
Between 2010 and 2020, the DD-CIA method focusing on component interaction was used
within the research line "Sustainable Surgery and Translational technology" at the Delft
University of Technology to improve a series of surgical and medical devices. To validate the
DD-CIA, each of the innovations was compared with the existing state-of-the-art. Objective
assessment was done based on the number of components, the complexity of the device and
the complexity in use.
Only devices were included that made it towards a Technology Readiness Level of 8 (market
introduction) and were used in pre-clinical research. From the design process, only the
influence of the DD-CIA on the design of the device is described and evaluated here.
Depending on the relevance, the impact of the DD-CIA on the number of parts, complexity,
costs and efficiency in terms of procedural time or logistic steps reduction is evaluated. In the
following examples it is explained how these steps are integrated into the design process of
various surgical devices, including a surgical implant, surgical instruments, a storage system
and an isolator system.

                                                                                                                       107
Example 1: Expanding the functions of structural components
Ever since the introduction of laparoscopic surgery, researchers have been trying to add
steerability to instruments to allow the surgeon to operate with better reach and less tissue
interaction force. Using the DD-CIA (Table 1), it was indicated that traditional solutions often
use a combination of springs, cables, pulleys and guiding structures, resulting in (semi)-
disposable instruments that cannot be properly cleaned and thus are very costly to
manufacture and maintain. An alternative was found for the use of cables, resulting in a multi-
steerable, cable-less 5-mm instrument line for arthroscopic and laparoscopic surgery, with
instruments that operate based on shaft rotations (Figure 5). 58-60

The focused design question was defined as: How can relative tube movements within a fully
modular instrument translate finger motions towards tip steering in 3D? A new steering
technology was developed accordingly and the assembly and disassembly potential was
validated with ten participants, who showed that it was possible to fully dismantle and
reassemble the instrument 60 times within an acceptable timeframe. In addition, ten medical
students used a laparoscopic grasper with integrated steering technology in the ForceSense
box-trainer system on a 3D pick-and-place task (Figure 6), showing good outcomes in control
effort based on learning curves for steering errors, task time, instrument path length, and
maximum tissue interaction force.57

tube (R1), which drives the red sliders. B Beak rotation (r2) and closure or opening (t1) are
accomplished by rotation (R2) or translation (T1) of the inner tube, which drives the green
sliders. C The inner rod fixed to the handle prevents rotation of all the sliders, while allowing
translation. Figure by Tim Horeman.
Example 2: function outplacement
The ForceSense is a set of sensors (Figure 6) that can be used in a so-called box-trainer that
allows surgery residents to train their technical skills in laparoscopic surgery. The sensors
measure the instrument motion and interaction force that is used to assess performance
during training, in terms of efficient instrument use and safe tissue manipulation. The
ForceTRAP 3D force sensor was developed for use inside the ForceSense with the DD-CIA
approach, as the restriction in instrument diameter (e.g. 5 mm diameter) does not allow for
easy integration of sensors. The component interaction analysis conducted on laparoscopic
instruments in combination with the complex user context (e.g. should be used with multiple
instruments and for training) resulted in a large set of design requirements for
implementation of a sensor in the instruments.
This directed any potential solution of measuring forces and motions in laparoscopic
instruments away from the instrument. In fact, filling out Table 1 in this case dictated that
interaction forces should not be measured in the instrument as seen in the sate-of-the-art in
instrument design, but instead the reaction forces should be measured under the training

                                                           110
task. This allows for training with any 5-mm instrument, without wear of the measuring
elements. The advantage of using real, unmodified instruments for training in surgical
procedures led to a series of studies on using the ForceTRAP with and without force feedback
on a real cadaver specimen during arthroscopic knee61, elbow62 and wrist surgery63 and
training for dermatologic procedures64 and laparoscopic surgery.65,66

Example 3: Create new sub-functions by removing material
One of the risks related to tissue manipulation in laparoscopic surgery is that distorted haptic
feedback causes high pinch forces that can damage soft internal tissues during manipulation.
Standard solutions consist of complex decoupling mechanisms, system actuated ratchets and
end-stops that increase the handle dimensions or break parts that damage after overloading67,
causing the user to get a new instrument and dispose of the damaged one. Filling out Table 1
showed that similar functionality can be reached by using the tension build-up in the main
push-pull rod that drives the tip. To create a locking mechanism out of an existing component
(Figure 7), a standard push-pull rod was machined with a single manufacturing wire cutting
machine that eroded a specific shape
in the rod, allowing it to deform under
loading. When the pulling force
reaches a predefined threshold, the
rod deforms and locks itself inside the
instrument shaft, preventing high
actuation at the handle side which
could result in dangerously high pinch
forces in the beak that could damage
delicate tissue. This simple mechanism
reduced the number of extra
components related to the
functionality overloading protection to
zero.66

Example 4: Temporary structural support to facilitate multiple sub-functions

Perianal fistulas are a common and

incapacitating problem. Many patients are

treated by seton drainage to prevent

recurrent abscess formation. For centuries,

a vessel loop or suture has been used for

seton drainage. The knot (or suture) that is

necessary to tie both ends together often

causes complaints interfering with the

patient's quality of life. When removing the

knot, it became evident that it is best to

directly connect the distal ends of the seton

wire in line with each other for a smooth

result. Due to the nature of the seton, the    Figure 8. Top left: Old seton solution. Top

interacting during the different stages

based on their material properties showed the need for a strong connection that allows a high

tension when components are connected with each other. It also showed the need for low

overall stiffness to reduce pain and discomfort. Instead of using additional components,

modifications or material combinations that facilitate this firm connection, the analysis using

Table 1 dictates using the seton silicone component to facilitate more of the required sub-

functions. Thus, one flexible tube was made that can be cut to the required length and does

not cause discomfort due to high tension in the material by making it hollow and adding an

internal connection rod.

The challenge became to create a high tension/friction connection after closure of the ring, as
the material buckles and deforms when one tries to establish this connection. The DD-CIA
analysis of this interaction problem indicated that it is desired to temporarily restrict the
expansion direction of the material by inserting it with an "applier" (Figure 8). After
connection, the applier, which provides temporary stiffness and rigidity, must be removed.
Thus, the established pre-tension within the seton wall is high enough for the seton ring to
remain functional for up to 3 months. A validation study conducted in 50 patients where a
knotted seton was replaced by the knotless seton showed a significantly decreased discharge
(P=0.005) and pain (P<0.001) 68.

Furthermore, 71% of patients reported fewer cleaning problems compared to the knotted
seton, indicating the feasibility of the knotless seton design with promising short-term results.
This valuable study allowed the creation of a startup that fostered the technology into the
certification process and first sales.
Example 5: Use of suture tension to measure force
During suturing, tension is applied to the suture ends to bring wound edges together or to
create a high-quality knot. In many cases, like wound closure after a laparotomy or during
reconstructive or cosmetic surgery, it is important to know the tension in the wound as an
indicator for a proper healing process.
When force sensors are used, the output of the force-sensing element can be related to the
thread tension by making a connection between sensor and wire, placing the measurement
unit in between the different parts of the wire. However, especially in case of multiple stitches
in a suture or tying a knot, it is time-consuming or costly to place a force sensor between the
surgeon's hands and the suture, or to modify an instrument. Moreover, the surgical site is very
small in size and most sensors are too large and bulky to place between the wound edges in
order to measure the wire tension in a continuous or matrass suture during wound closure.
The DD-CIA approach showed that in this case interruption of the wire and the resulting
connection of the ends to a sensor should be prevented. Using Table 1 led to the solution in
which the path of the wire was altered to create a resulting force around a rotation point
without damaging the wire. The changing position of this rotation point can be measured with
a tiny hall sensor and a magnet, and is directly related to the wire tension. It can be calibrated
to display or indicate the wire tension (Figure 9, left). The researchers demonstrated that this
principle can even be used reliably inside a compressed closed wound and can be integrated
in a small force-measuring device that gives direct feedback about force levels69 (Figure 9,
right). Therefore, a series of reusable measurement sensors was launched with a reduced
mass, size and invasiveness compared to traditional methods.

Example 6: Use of component movements in a new safety function
Veress needles are commonly used in establishing pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic surgery
but can result a serious laparoscopic entry complication, like bowel perforation and vascular
injury, related to the unintentional overshooting of the needle part after entering the
abdominal volume (Figure 10). As these complications are potentially life-threatening, they
should be avoided at all costs. Therefore, improving the safety of this action is paramount
triggering multiple research teams to add sensory systems and control mechanisms (e.g.
attaching a robot arm) to provide as much info and control to the surgeon during placement
of the Veress needle. Independent from their potential effect, these systems mainly seem to
increase the complexity and costs of the procedure.

Figure 10. Analysis of the components during overshooting of the needle after reaching the
abdominal area. In this load case, the driving force F axial is not immediately removed after
passing the last tissue layer with the tip. Figure by Tim Horeman.
Based on the DD-CIA approach, focusing on function expansion of existing components, a new
safety mechanism was developed for the Veress needle which decreases the risks of
overshooting.
Table 1 helped to identify that the motion characteristics of the inner stylet can be used to
decouple the driving force generated by hand and arm inertia. The mechanism works by
preventing acceleration of the tip of the needle by decoupling the surgeon's hand from the
needle immediately after entering the abdomen.

                                                                                                                       115
Figure 11. Veress needle PLUS concept with extra safety mechanism that decouples the hand
movement from the needle immediately after insertion. The energy in the moving stylet is used

In a series of studies, eighteen participants (novices, intermediates and experts) performed a
total of 248 insertions in a systematic way with wide- and small-bore versions of the
conventional Veress needle and the Veress needle PLUS.70,71 The insertion depth was
measured by recording the graduations on the needle under direct laparoscopic vision. For
wider acceptation of the innovation in a lather phase of development, strategic choices can
be made to make the experiments as inclusive as possible by comparing as much conditions
as possible. In a set of pre-clinical experiments, researchers looked at the general feel of the
needles during use in different types of bodies, differences between male and female
surgeons, the wear and tear, and different needle sizes. The participants found the procedures
conducted with the new needle felt lifelike and agreed that the Veress needle PLUS
significantly reduced the insertion depth in all tested conditions. Thus, a completely new
safety mechanism was introduced by introducing just three extra parts, by making efficient
use of the energy running through the existing design of the standard Veress needle.

Example 7: A cleanroom integrated instrument concept
Airborne particles in the operating room are a concern for both patient and staff. Many
complex ventilation systems have been designed to reduce the number of these potentially
dangerous particles, microorganisms or viruses inside the operating room (Figure 12, left).
However, when trying to execute laparoscopic surgery with an extended range of motion of
the instrument handles inside an isolator system, the plastic covering material gives too much
friction and limits the surgeon's arm movements.
When following the DD-CIA approach to replace the plastic cover material, it was found to be
possible to turn the traditional trocar (e.g. guiding tube for laparoscopic instruments) design
into a small, sterile environment around the critical components, instruments and open
surgical area, by developing an Isolator System (IS). The system includes a sleeve to protect
the instrument shaft and tip and a special balloon to protect the incision and trocar tube72.
This makes it possible to perform surgery safely inside a non-sterile environment in case a
patient is infected with a contagious disease (Figure 12, right).
Within this design direction, the DD-CIA approach shows us that it is important to keep the tip
and shaft in the isolator when the instrument is disconnected, allowing the instrument to
enter the trocar when the system is locked, ensuring a safe and reliable lock between coupling
and ensuring that, when disconnected, both the trocar and the coupling are not leaking. The
system works with just a single button that disconnects the coupling, so that the mental load
related to instrument handling remains low.

shaft isolator locked on IS-trocars during a laparoscopic procedure. Right: Only when coupled,
instruments can pass the IS trocar. A: IS trocar. B: Incision-Port Shield made of silicone.

When pressing the button to disconnect, the input energy is used to seal off the opening of
the now-isolated instrument by expansion of a pin under pressure. Secondly, extra input
energy extracted from the same moving button is stored in a deformed spring blade. This
energy is used to automatically lock the coupling of the isolated instrument on the trocar after.
This simple single button-operated design allows the system to contain up to seven functions
by storing and releasing energy in a smart way, ensuring minimal impact on the already
complex workflow related to the handing of laparoscopic instruments. Furthermore, this
design approach reduces the amount of disposable plastic used by more than 90%.

consuming to remove and generate

waste. By removing the sterility sensor

and tie-wraps from the system, the

DD-CIA approach helped to create a

new safe transport container73 (Figure

be pressurized with sterile air (A)      Figure 13. The SteriBox concept. The gas pressure

into the corresponding slots (D). This

ensures that the lid of the container cannot be removed as long as the instruments are

surrounded by sterile air. Moreover, a pressure indicator is created by adding a visual

extension on one of the moving parts of the locking plate, allowing a direct observation of the

pressure in the box.

items. (2020).

                                         118
Any loss of pressure due to rough handling results in a change in the visual indicator and a
loose lid, providing two indicators that warn the user when the instrument sterility has been
compromised. Replacing the disposable sensor and tie-wraps, which both have two individual
functions (e.g. indicating contamination and securing the closed lid), by a simple locking plate
with pressurized air, the standard transport box not only becomes more sustainable, but also
more reliable.

DD-CIA model validation discussion

While using the DD-CIA method in all examples above, it became clear that it is beneficial to
describe all functions of all components that cause problems during use of the device in clear
technical terms. The examples indicate that a structured design approach with a focus on
function expansion of already-existing components often led to interesting new designs. New
functions in these designs are fully integrated at minimum costs, resulting in increased
sustainability, as the reduction of device complexity by removing system components is
always leading. Especially in complex surgical settings, every attempt to reduce complexity
increases the chance of successful implementation and adoption by all stakeholders.

In all cases described above, the substantial reduction of components that eventually lead to
hospital waste will contribute to a more sustainable healthcare system. For example, the
cable-less steering technology allows the instruments to become stronger due to the layered
instrument shaft and a much smaller instrument diameter, as there are no cables inside to
steer the tip. In this case the DD-CIA design approach worked on multiple levels and ensured
a first generation of fully reusable instruments that comply with the guidelines of the FDA in
terms of cleanability and inspection, while strongly reducing the number of parts.

The force restrictor needle and force measuring box trainer designs showed that essential new
features can be simply cut out of existing components with laser, water or wire cutting
relocated outside the intended design framework, by measuring not the grasping force inside
the instrument but the reaction force under the training task. Both approaches sharply
reduced the complexity in terms of number of parts needed inside the instruments. The
Veress needle PLUS and IS trocar designs showed the value of obtaining energy from already
moving parts. The moving stylet inside the standard Veress needle was used, with a minimum
set of extra components, to trigger an existing mechanism that prevents overshooting in a
very reliable way, thus removing the need for very space consuming control devices to limit
overshoot like a force-controlled robot arm. The moving button and pin within the IS trocar
coupling were equipped with an energy storage spring system that allowed the coupling to
lock automatically after being placed correctly above the trocar. Besides leading to very simple
designs, the DD-CIA method also directly reduced the interaction complexity by reducing the
number of additional systems and interaction/actuation means needed to use a system inside
the operating room.

The Steribox concept showed that even gas used to create a sterile field around processed
instruments can a constructive component when it is pressurized. Pressurizing the bag just a
little more does not require any changes to the already-existing airflow systems as, by nature,
pumps always use pressure to create a flow.

                                                                                                                       119
This pressure became functional after using it to lift a locking plate mechanism that ensured
that the box is always closed when being full and cannot be opened. As a bonus, the
pressurized locking plate changes configuration when the inner volume is filled with gas and,
in essence, becomes a sensor that directly relates its position to inner sterility. Therefore, this
single plate adds two functions within a simple container design.
Besides the impact a design process can make on the costs related to the complexity of a
design and the validation and verification process, a significant impact is made on the waste
generated by medical devices and in particular disposables. If a more integrated design
approach reduces the number of components in a design, less energy is needed for
manufacturing of the components and CO2 emissions will be lower. Moreover, it is likely that
fewer parts means that the device will have a lower weight and therefore less mass needs to
be incinerated. This adds to the relevance of a smart design process for medical devices.

Main takeaways of this chapter:
      Circular engineering applies to products and processes and can be described as ideas
         and concepts that solve engineering problems which eliminate waste and pollution,
         keep products and materials in circulation and regenerates nature.
      The Design-by-Dissection approach helps to fully investigate the impact a redesign
         solution makes on the complex surgical workflow in order to mitigate risks.
      Using sustainability as a driver to make product designs less complex can be
         accomplished by using the Design by Dissection strategy by executing a Component
         Interaction Analysis (DD-CIA).
      The DD-CIA strategy can be used for different types of products and focusses on the
         possibility of combining functions in single components.
      Functions of components can be seen as energy transmissions defined by
         combinations of physical actions like force, torque, movements, electricity or light
         communication. This helps to gain insights into the simplification possibilities of
         devices.

     Behind the neurophysiological aspects of
 sustainability: Neuromarketing and sustainable

                    buying behaviors

New trends in consumer behavior
From the first chapters it became clear that it is essential to create greener products as result
of the implementation of more sustainable circular processes. As this topic becomes more
important, the marketing power of this kind of terminology from a marketing perspective is
increasing. Unfortunately, this can lead to "green" claims that are only made to foster the
sales of a product that do not hold any ground from a scientific perspective. The following
chapter was written to better understand these phenomena.
The development of the internet and other modern technologies have transformed our lives.
The internet has brought down the walls of the world, making a very large offer of services
and products accessible to us 24/7, worldwide. Every day, we are seemingly only a few clicks
away from millions of products and brands, generating a window of opportunities for us, the
consumers.
In time, we have become used to wanting more products, comparing their qualities and
characteristics on search engines (e.g., Google shopping), demanding better (usually lower)
prices, and sharing our experiences about products and services more widely, e.g. on social
media. This all contributes to a society which is more and more characterized by consumption.
While consumption is a generalized process, we cannot presume it is a linear one. It requires
a certain degree of adaptation, as not all consumers, companies, sectors and countries are
integrated in the system.74

Scholars Publishing.

                                                                                                                       123
In an ideal world, the increased request for consumption worldwide should benefit both
companies and consumers equally. Instead, the growth of consumerism has caused a hyper-
competitive environment, which forces firms to manufacture more products than they can
sell. To establish a significant local, national or global presence for their brand or products,
companies need to find synergies with their customers to scale efficiently and profitably.

It comes as no surprise that the "mortality" of new products is usually very high. According to
a recent study, every year about 30,000 new products are introduced to the market, and every
year, 95% of them fail to make the cut.75 In fact, about 75% of consumer goods and retail
products make less than $7.5 million during their first year.76

This trend is also visible in advertising. Back in 1965, the average buyer was able to remember
a major proportion of products and/or ads presented (around 34%); however, a couple of
decades later the percentage had dropped to 8%. A survey of 1000 consumers in 2007 found
that individuals could remember only a small percentage (2.21%) of ads they had seen
throughout their lives.77 So, the question arises: how can businesses make sense of what
consumers need and want in this hyper-competitive environment?

The answer of course lies with the consumers. Understanding consumers' needs and inner
desires, and decoding and cracking the shopping behavior consumption code is what
companies have aspired to do for a long time. Despite the advancement of modern
technologies, many concepts, methodologies and techniques used to study consumer
behavior have remained untouched for a long period of time.

For instance, self-reports, surveys and interviews are still the most common techniques used
in marketing to investigate consumers' preferences for products and services. However, these
techniques provide a limited understanding of why and how people make decisions about
product and services.

This is due to how the information is collected, such as asking consumers to explain, describe
or recall specific information or experiences they had with a brand, product or service. For
instance, consumers might not be entirely aware of their reasons for their answer due to loss
of memory or even boredom. Implicit and explicit bias might also be present; for instance,
respondents are not always encouraged to give accurate answers, or they might not feel
comfortable giving an answer which pictures them in an unfavorable manner.

Given the difficulty of achieving competitive advantage using traditional marketing methods,
researchers and companies have realized that marketing can benefit from integrating and
combining theories and tools from other disciplines. At the beginning of the 21st century, a
novel approach arose for studying consumer behavior by integrating neuroscience tools,
psychological methods and marketing theories. This has led to the rise of a new and
interdisciplinary field of study: Consumer Neuroscience, a.k.a. neuromarketing.78
The popularity of neuromarketing has rapidly increased in the last two decades (see Figure 1).
Neuromarketing research focuses on investigating the physiological and neurophysiological
mechanisms that support and affect consumer behavior. The application of neuroscience tools
to study consumer behavior aims at investigating which physiological and neurophysiological
responses are involved and affected while consumers process marketing stimuli. Once these
areas are identified, researchers try to associate them with cognitive and psychological
processes underlying the consumption process. Compared to more traditional marketing
techniques (e.g. surveys), neuromarketing tools can be used to understand implicit processes
that are usually impossible to examine due to the unwillingness of consumers to answer
questions, or the inability of consumers to explain their own behavior. Thus, the application
of neuroscience tools allows marketing researchers to study both physiological and neural
processes of consumers' decision-making processes, rather than only psychological
mechanisms.

Neuromarketing tools can be used to support the study of consumer behavior in several
context, such as branding, advertising, pricing and product assessment.79
Firstly, neuromarketing can help companies study the impact of ads on consumer behavior
(e.g., satisfaction, liking) and cognitive processes (e.g., engagement, memory), but also
emotional responses (positive or negative). Similarly, neuromarketing tools can help
companies to investigate neural processes involved in memorizing a brand's name or logos,
but also the reward mechanisms linked to brand loyalty. Neuromarketing tools are also used
to study the impact of price on consumers' expectations (positive, neutral or negative).
Finally, neuromarketing tools can be used to analyze how consumers evaluate the quality,
design or eco-friendliness of products or services. Neuromarketing aims to understand
individual preferences for products and, consequently, understand how and when the human
brain processes the information it received about a brand. In fact, certain neural mechanisms
can be triggered several milliseconds before the stimulus is presented. This suggests that
consumers are often already processing information about a product or service, before being
aware of it.
Overall, neuromarketing research focuses on neuronal and cognitive process during
marketing-relevant behavior, and in the moment that directly precede or follow such
behaviors.80
This contributes to building models that improve the predictions of purchasing behavior.81
However, the type of information that we can retrieve and analyze using neuroscience
depends on the type of tools used. The next section describes the neuroscience tools currently
used in neuromarketing research.

Neuromarketing tools

There are a variety of tools or methods that can be used for neuromarketing research. These
tools can be divided into two classes: physiological and neurophysiological tools.82
Physiological tools measure the autonomous functions of the body, such as breathing, pupil
dilation, sweating, blood pressure and heart rate. Thus, these tools allow us to study all human
reactions that originate in the brain, but they do not reflect our brain activity. The autonomous
functions of the body are usually not under a person's intentional control; therefore, they
cannot be biased like self-reports or surveys. Tools used to measure physiological reactions
are eye-trackers (ET), electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GRS) and facial
expression recognition software (fEMG) 83 (see Table 1).

An eye tracker is a non-invasive tool that allows measurement of eye movements, fixations
and pupil dilation. Eye tracking can be portable (e.g., through glasses) or non-portable (e.g., a
bar fixed below a computer screen). Changes in the speed, direction and number of fixations
usually provide information about consumers' visual attention and interest and the
attractiveness of a product, image or website. Similarly, pupil dilation could provide
information about excitement and fear.

Eye tracking outputs results in measurements (maps or paths) of consumers' visual attention
behaviors (e.g., heat maps, focus maps and scan paths). Each of these measurements gives
different information about where and for how long consumers focus their attention on a
stimulus. Eye tracking has several applications in marketing, for instance measuring
consumers' preferences for billboards, TV and YouTube videos, or different versions of
product packaging or websites. For this reason, eye tracking is a very popular tool in
neuromarketing research.

Secondly, the electrocardiogram is a very simple, portable, non-invasive tool which enables
researchers to measure the electrical activity of the heart. This tool thus gives information
about the emotional state of consumers, as changes in a person's hearth rate may be
correlated with increasing levels of stress and/or excitement as a response to certain triggers.
Researchers usually use ECGs to measure consumers' arousal or preference for different
version of TV commercials or videos.

Thirdly, galvanic skin response is used to measure the electrical conductance and temperature
of the skin. This indicates the level of arousal of consumers, as a result of the level of
awareness and excitement towards a product or service. Its most common use is in detecting
preferences for different versions of movie trailers and social media posts.

Finally, facial expression recognition software is used to match a consumer's facial expression
with their emotions, as facial expressions are important codes of emotional reactions
(positive, neutral or negative). Thus, this software can be used to measure consumers'
emotional reactions to different marketing stimuli, such as preferences for different versions
of YouTube videos, and their product experience (e.g., candy testing).

82, 83. Alvino, L., Pavone, L., Abhishta, A., & Robben, H. (2020). Picking your brains: Where and how
neuroscience tools can enhance marketing research. Frontiers in Neuroscience, 14, 577666.

                                                                                                                       127
Neurophysiological tools can help us identify when and where neural activity in the brain is
associated with the ability to perform a particular cognitive task.84 Thus, these tools can be
used to measure cognitive processes involved in product consumption and decision-making
process for product or services (e.g., brand recollection). Neurophysiological tools can be
divided into two groups: tools that measure electrical activity (electroencephalography), and
those that measure metabolic brain activity (functional magnetic resonance imaging).
Electroencephalography (EEG) "is a non-invasive medical imaging technique that records the
extra-cellular electrical activity of the brain, generated by the action potentials of neurons".85
EEG is one of the most-used tools in neuromarketing research as it enables researchers to
measure changes in brain activity linked to product preferences, in-store experience or
promotion strategies.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures the neural activity through the
increasing of blood flow and metabolic activity in a specific area of the brain.86
Thus, fMRI can detect changes in the brain activity due to the increase in blood flow.87
fMRI can be used to study consumer preferences for products, visual stimuli (e.g., specific
videos or images), brand preferences and loyalty. fMRI can also be used to study several
cognitive phenomena (e.g., engagement, memory, reward and valencies), but it is more
expensive and the procedure takes longer than EEG.

Neuromarketing and sustainability

Our planet's sustainability and its preservation have become important issues. Nowadays,
significant efforts are made to promote sustainable consumption by increasing the production
of green products and services (e.g., pesticide-free products, reusable, etc.) and generating
more government supports and tools (e.g., education, subsidies, taxes, communications
campaigns). In the past few decades, these policies have had direct or indirect effects on how
consumers make decisions about products and services. On the one hand, companies are
pushing green products and services into the market to attract the attention of customers and
being more sustainable in their missions. On the other hand, consumers' increased awareness
about sustainability is forcing companies to act upon these issues, meaning they have to show
more commitment to sustainability and more transparency (e.g., tracking all the steps of a
product's life cycle) and accountability (e.g., how organizations acknowledgement
responsibility for their actions, decisions, etc.) about their environmental impact.

Transparency and accountability are particularly important for consumers in order to avoid
greenwashing or propaganda.88 Greenwashing can be the result of intentional or
unintentional false claims or misleading information about green product/services or a
company's overall commitment towards sustainability. Thus, companies must gain insight into
the decision-making process and behavior of consumers towards sustainability issues.89

Thus, companies, as well as governments, alike aim to understand:

Which factors affect sustainable consumption? What actions are consumers taking to develop
a more sustainable lifestyle? Which consumers are more sensitive to greenwashing activities?
How can consumers recognize greenwashing propaganda?

Despite the increased use of new and more sophisticated technologies to promote and
distribute product and services, self-reports, surveys and interviews are still the main ways of
studying how consumers assess the environmental actions of companies and approach
sustainable consumption. As discussed before, these tools have limitations, as consumers are
often reluctant or incapable to explain their choices about products or services. Instead,
applying neuroscience techniques can help understand the cognitive and emotional aspects
involved in sustainable behavior and green actions.

Neuromarketing supports existing marketing theories by identifying hidden mechanisms or
unconscious processes that drive consumption and purchasing behavior for green products
(e.g., coffee, clothing).90 Neuromarketing tools can help understand which brain areas are
active during product assessment and evaluate cerebral activation in the presence of
environmental elements (e.g., message, tag). Thus, they can identify when and how implicit
biases and unconscious processes steer "rational" decision-making processes.

A specific application of neuromarketing tools in sustainability could be to identify how
individuals' environmental bias affects cognitive processes (e.g., memorizing logos), emotions
(e.g., high or low excitement for sustainability) and decision-making. Consumers more
sensitive to environmental issues might behave differently than those not predisposed to
sustainable consumption behaviors. Using neuroscience tools, we can test if these ideological
dissimilarities can produce diverse physiological responses and changes in our brain activity.91
Hence, it might help identify the relevant psychological and neural mechanisms that explain
sustainable conception and pro-environmental behavior.92

For instance, one neuromarketing experiment shows that green consumers (e.g., people who
try to protect the environment by selectively purchasing green products or services) have
dissimilar brainwave responses as non-green consumers when exposed to green products.
Using EEG, researchers measured an increase in the brain activity (frontal areas) of green
consumers in response to environmentally-friendly advertisements and products,93 e.g.,
higher levels of delta, theta and beta waves (Figure 2).

Neuromarketing tools can also be used to maximize the effectivity of "green" advertisement
and to encourage sustainable consumption. We can use these tools to assess how distinctive
ads and messages are processed by consumers (e.g., positively or negatively). When designing
an advertisement for green products, we need to consider how different types of messages
will trigger distinctive emotional responses. For instance, messages designed with a gain-
frame (i.e. they emphasize the benefits, e.g., "if don't buy fast fashion, you won't pollute our
planet") are usually found to be more effective than messages designed with loss frame (i.e.
they emphasize the costs, e.g., "if you don't buy natural products, you won't help yourself stay
healthy").95 This suggests that companies should focus on defining the best frame to
effectively convey messages to their audience.

Finally, neuroscience tools can help manufacturers and retailers to define how to anticipate
on sustainable consumption. In fact, neuroscience tools and methods can be used to nudge
consumers into behaving more sustainably. For instance, retailers can influence consumer
behavior by providing relevant information about the eco-friendly nature of their products,
by expanding the number of "green" products on offer, and by putting eco-friendly products
in prominent places in the store.

Tools like eye tracking can be used to measure consumers' visual attention to green products
in the store. In fact, the positioning of a product and the type of information displayed can
affect how consumers look and select products in a store. Neuromarketing research finds that
higher visual attention mechanisms to green products are connected to higher willingness to
pay a premium for these products.96

In addition, studying visual attention helps defining which information or elements impact
how consumers choose green products. For instance, the color green can affect a consumer's
visual attention mechanism, due to its association with the natural or organic properties of a
product. Thus, anything that is green (e.g., price tag, label) should help consumers to easily
spot sustainable products.

However, companies might also use colors to trick consumers into believing they are buying
sustainable products, even when they are not (a.k.a. greenwashing). A neuromarketing study
found that these greenwashing practices might considerably reduce visual attention towards
"real" green products.97

Additional point-of-purchase (PoP) information about the type of product (fair-trade, organic,
etc.) can be used to signal green products to consumers. Using eye-tracking, we can measure
how easily consumers spot PoP information. PoP information influences a consumer's visual
attention towards green products. On average, consumers spend more time looking at green
products if PoP information is present than when it is absent. Based on this, neuromarketing
shows how retailers could use both colored price tags and PoP information to signal green
products to consumers and give additional information about these products. By orienting
consumers' visual attention towards these green products, retailers can nudge consumers to
acknowledge and eventually buy these products. These actions should be aimed to support
consumer choices about green products and prevent greenwashed practices that obstruct
consumers from finding green products.

Overall, joint efforts of individuals and companies alike to be more eco-friendly and
sustainability-minded can help the preservation of environmental resources and ensure a
better quality of life for us and the planet at large. In the last two decades, advances in
neuroscience tools have led to neuromarketing, a new approach to study sustainable
consumption and green behavior.

Neuroscience tools like EEG, fMRI, ET, ECG, GSR and fEMG can be used to develop green
marketing practices and strategies. These tools can offer us different insights into how green
messages, product characteristics and displays affect consumers' preferences and buying
behaviors. Neuroscience tools in sustainability issues can be applied to three different areas:
1) understanding consumer individual differences
2) improve green advertisement effectiveness and
3) nudging sustainable consumption behaviors.
Both manufacturers and retailers can play an important role in driving consumers towards
sustainable practices, and neuroscience is the "secret weapon" that can help shaping
sustainable consumption behavior.

Main takeaways of this chapter:
     General consumption habits and challenges for companies have changed over the
         past decades due to the internet and other modern technologies.
     Neuromarketing is a new field of study at the intersection of three disciplines:
         marketing, neuroscience and psychology.
     Neuroscience tools can be divided in two categories based on the type of
         measurements: 1) physiological and 2) neurophysiological.
     There are several neuroscience tools used in marketing research, such as EEG, fMRI,
         ECG, ET, GSR and fERS.
     Neuromarketing tools can be used in several marketing domains, such as advertising,
         branding, pricing, product development and user experience.
     Neuromarketing can be used to study sustainable consumption and green behaviors.
     Neuromarketing can be applied to three different areas: 1) understanding consumer
         individual differences, 2) improve green advertisement effectiveness and 3) nudging
         sustainable consumption behaviors.

                        Reflection

The population on our planet has grown tremendously: from one billion humans in 1800 to
over 8 billion in 2022. As a result of this large growth, the amount of greenhouse gases emitted
by human activities - especially carbon dioxide - has grown as well.
The golden age of capitalism in the post-war period led to global expansion of economic
growth and globalization. Growing wealth in combination with the rapid growth of the
population resulted in a mass consumption society. The economy worked with a linear model
based on a "make - use - dispose" principle.
After decades of severe natural resource depletion, it was realized that this linear model is not
sustainable. In its place, the circular economy was introduced, based on the "make - use -
reuse" model. In this system, the product life cycle is extended and waste is minimized or
reused.
Hospitals use a standard way of working, focused on single-use products. Therefore, it is a
challenge to implement circular strategies. Concepts such as `pay-per-use' or sharing of capital
goods between hospitals, or reuse, product repair, maintenance and refurbishment, are
rather often not (yet) considered in the healthcare sector.
Climate change as a business case can lead to cost reduction, new business opportunities and
better protection of the earth's ecosystems. Urban mining may provide a growing harvesting
resource, where materials are not mined underground, but from stocks above the ground.
From this perspective, the operating room can be considered a goldmine of valuable raw
materials.
Yet, a circular healthcare economy is possible, as this book has aimed to show. The circular
healthcare economy aims to reduce hospital waste streams by defining specific waste as new
resource material and remove them from the waste flow before incineration (Figure 1). More
and more evidence for this kind of reprocessing technology foster the circular healthcare
economy as a movement followed by a growing interest around the world for new circular
business models. This was the starting point of the new "Hospital MiningTM" movement.

valuable materials such as high-quality polypropylene, PET and stainless steel 304 and 316 that

The circular model builds economic, natural and social capital on three principles, driven by
the three design principles: 98

     Eliminate waste and pollution.
     Circulate products and materials (at their highest value).
     Regenerate nature.

The circular economy is an opportunity to solve many challenges. It is a method to combat
climate change and realize growth of the economy at the same time. New circular business
models will emerge which will introduce sustainable solutions, create jobs, develop new
technology and create ecological stability.

The leaders of tomorrow need to embrace circular economy principles, create new ideas,
refuse polluting products and processes, develop sustainable technology, start new projects,
connect with others and inspire people to take action.

Change is needed. In the new circular economy, materials will never become waste or
pollution, whether they are plastics or metal-based materials. Circular design will ensure that
the new products are reusable, re-manufacturable, recyclable, or compostable.
Using circular engineering to design out waste in our future products and processes will help
to eliminate waste and pollution and keep products in circulation. The circular engineering
principles can be applied in future designs with circular strategies such as reuse, repair,
remanufacturing and finally recycling for both products and processes.
Specific design methods, guidelines and strategies like the DD-CIA methodology can be
created for the design and re-design of products that do not comply anymore to the changing
world. The sooner sustainability becomes part of any creative phase within a design approach,
the more likely it has a larger effect on the environment during the product's lifetime.
Consumer behavior is changing towards increased sustainable solutions, creating greater
support for circular design. We can use neuromarketing to study sustainable consumption and
stimulate "green" behavior.
In addition to raising public awareness and developing new sustainable technologies, it is
highly important to anchor circular engineering in our educational system and to teach the
managers and politicians of tomorrow how they can apply circular strategies. Whether or not
we want to be circular is a choice. Technically, it is possible to have an entirely circular
economy. Whether you are an engineer, policymaker, hospital staff member, student or
industry representative: look for the opportunities that circular economy can bring and apply
the principles in your daily practice.
If we combine our efforts to take action, we can support the next generations by designing
sustainable products and processes which make the world more circular.

                                                           138
Why should we apply circular economy principles?

Everyone seems to be talking about sustainability. But why should we care? Is it because we
feel guilty? Because we have to hand over the world properly to our children? Are we doing it
for our own peace of mind? Or does it provide new products and services from which we can
earn?

It's about us having a choice. A choice to be sustainable or not. From the philosophical
perspective, making choices gives us freedom and freedom makes us think. Aristotle argues
that making choices contributes to character building. And that characterizes us as authors to
fully commit to sustainability and circular principles.

We acknowledge, just like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, that the current take-make-waste
industrial model is no longer sustainable. It should be replaced by a circular economy which
aims to redefine growth and aim to realize positive society-wide benefits with less waste. We
quote the Ellen MacArthur Foundation by stating that circular "economy principles" entails
gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, and
designing out waste from products and processes". This should be supported by a transition
to renewable energy sources.

For the authors, this is a vision in which they believe. A vision that can be realized in
collaboration. A collaboration between governments, industry, hospitals, consumers and
science ideally directed by Academia and education. Academia (Figure 2) should play a leading
role in this development through research and education. Circular economy principles offer a
range of benefits that make them highly valuable for both the environment and the economy.
Some compelling reasons to adopt and promote circular economy principles are:

Resource Efficiency: The circular economy aims to minimize waste and optimize the use of
resources by promoting practices such as recycling, refurbishing and remanufacturing. This
reduces the need for extracting raw materials and prevents resource depletion.

Waste Reduction: Circular economy principles prioritize reducing waste generation, landfill
usage and incineration. By designing products with longer lifespans and encouraging repair
and reuse, less waste ends up in landfills or in incineration, reducing environmental pollution.

Environmental Preservation: By keeping products and materials in use for longer periods,
circular economy principles help to mitigate environmental degradation, including
deforestation, habitat destruction and pollution. This contributes to the preservation of
ecosystems and biodiversity.

Climate Change Mitigation: Circular economy principles reduce the need for energy-intensive
processes involved in extraction, manufacturing and disposal of products. It also lowers the
greenhouse gas emissions that are associated with waste management.

                                                                                                                       139
Economic Growth and Innovation: Circular economy principles can stimulate economic
growth by creating new business opportunities in areas like recycling, refurbishment and
remanufacturing. It fosters innovation in product design, materials and manufacturing
processes.
Job Creation: Circular economy practices can lead to the creation of new jobs in various
sectors, such as recycling facilities, repair shops and design firms focused on sustainable
products.
Resilience to Supply Chain Disruptions: A circular economy reduces dependence on scarce or
volatile raw materials, making supply chains more resilient to disruptions caused by factors
like geopolitical tensions or natural disasters.
Consumer Engagement: Circular economy principles encourage consumers to be more
conscious of their consumption patterns, promoting responsible purchasing decisions, repair
and reuse. This can lead to a shift towards a more sustainable consumer culture.
Reduced Environmental Pollution: Circular economy practices help minimize pollution caused
by waste disposal, landfill leakage and incineration, which can have detrimental effects on soil,
water and air quality.
Long-Term Cost Savings: Circular economy practices can lead to cost savings for businesses
through reduced material procurement and disposal costs, as well as energy savings from
more efficient resource use.
Regulatory Compliance and Reputation: As governments and consumers increasingly
demand environmentally responsible practices, adopting circular economy principles can help
businesses comply with regulations and enhance their reputation as sustainable and socially
responsible entities.
Global Sustainability Goals: Circular economy principles align with various global
sustainability goals, such as those outlined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), including responsible consumption and production, climate action and
preservation of life on land and below water.
Circular economy principles offer a holistic and forward-thinking approach, promoting a more
sustainable, resilient and equitable future for current and future generations.

By Bart van Straten

Writing this book was of a personal nature. An eye-opener for me was a special day with my children
and the Dutch astronaut Andre Kuipers. An afternoon was organized by my children's primary school.
We had arranged the location and were therefore an hour earlier, just like Andre Kuipers. It was
breathtaking to observe how Andre explained to my children about his stay in the International Space
Station ISS. He shared his experience in a special way, describing how fragile the atmosphere looks at
an altitude of 400 km comparable to an egg and its shell. A moment when I realized that we borrow
the Earth from our children and we owe them to take action. Another memorable moment was on
June 18, 2018, Bruno, Minister for Health, Welfare and Sports, received an instrument mesh basket
from me. We had made this instrument basket, partly from recycled stainless steel. What I couldn't
foresee at the time was the impact this handover would bring. In fact, this moment can be seen as the
start of my research period, a Field Lab and integration of circular economy principles in education.

"Unlocking the potential to change the world commences from within, catalysed by a single neuron,
nurtured by a solitary thought, and propelled forward with each deliberate step." What motivated me
to write about sustainable consumption is the unwavering belief in the unexploited potential within
each of us to address the pressing sustainability challenges of our time. As a consumer, a pivotal
awakening occurred during a chilly winter in Italy when I embarked on what I thought was a simple
quest to find a pair of trousers made from ethically sourced wool. The journey revealed the formidable
obstacles that stand in the way of sustainable choices in our everyday lives. Despite the best intentions
and deep motivation, sourcing clothing crafted from organic, natural fabrics proved a formidable
challenge. As a researcher, I have dedicated years to unravelling the complexity of factors influencing
sustainable consumption. This book bridges the two worlds I have inhabited--the world of consumers
striving for ethical choices and the world of researchers seeking to understand the intricate
mechanisms that shape those choices.

Although I am working on the prevention of surgical disposables by using sustainable design principles
to create more modular reusable alternatives since 2015, the real intrinsic motivation to do something
against the linear healthcare economy came during covid times in April 2018. After developing a
reprocessing and testing method for FFP2 face mask when the market was collapsed and surgical
procedures were postponed due to safety risks, our team in Utrecht received thousands of masks per
day, which were send to us, for reprocessing. When Boxes, containers and bags were stuffed with used
Personal Protection Means (PPM's) and brought or send to us from all corners of the Netherlands, we
realised that all this material that was filling our reprocessing facilities was normally incinerated. From
every 100.000 FFP2 face-masks that were send in, only 25.000 appeared good enough for reprocessing
while the rest needed to be disposed.

This enormous increase in waste that now moved from the hospitals and other caretakers to our team
in Utrecht needed to be addressed and forced us to investigate responsible possibilities to deal with
this waste stream in a sustainable way. Amongst others, this led to the new mechanical Polypropylene

Creating a circular healthcare economy

Circular strategies for a sustainable healthcare

Our world is the only planet, as far as we know, which harbors life. The number
of humans on our planet has grown tremendously. In 1800 one billion humans
occupied our earth; on 15 November 2022, this number reached 8 billion. After the
Second World War humanity witnessed gigantic global economic development
with great technological improvements. A result of this growth, the primary
greenhouse gasses emitted by human activities drastically increased. As the
economy developed, our consumption grew apace. In this book, Van Straten,
Alvino and Horeman present their findings on creating a sustainable healthcare
economy by introducing different circular strategies. In 9 chapters, they present
a wide variation of studies as practical cases to show what strategies and actions
can be taken to implement sustainable strategies for a circular healthcare.

This book was written in line with the courses they developed at TU Extension
School, the open online education edX platform of Delft University of Technology/
TU Delft. A leading university in science and technology and recognized for
conducting world-class research. This book is a manual for everyone who
follows the online courses `Circular strategies for sustainable healthcare' but
certainly also for those who want to discover more about circular strategies,
the principles and practices of the circular economy and urban mining. This
book is suitable for students, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in
the fields of healthcare sustainability, management, business and economics
