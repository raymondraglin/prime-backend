WHAT IS A DESIGN ROADMAP?

A roadmap on the strategy of design innovations takes the future vision as its destination. On the
map are pathways that are dotted with new products and services landmarks. For the journey
into the future time zone, a roadmap includes parallel tracks - next to the track for design
innovation in the existing business, a roadmap introduces the next frontiers of innovation with
new value propositions for new user groups. To learn more about the values of new users and
prepare for the disruption that a new value proposition may create, the alternative pathways
are mapped on the roadmap timeline - There are pathways that enhance the existing business
propositions and there are alternative routes towards the exploration of new market spaces
and new technology areas. The future timeline provides the backbone of the roadmap. Basically,
a design roadmap is a map used to visually track and strategically explore future design
innovations.
In this first chapter we will define what a roadmap is, and describe the overall process of
roadmapping. We will also take a deep-dive into the history of roadmapping and grasp some
inspiration from cartographic roadmaps. You will see that even the earliest roadmaps had
extraordinary visual power.

     Definition of what a roadmap is                                                                A ROADMAP is a visual portray of design innovation
                                                                                                    elements plotted on a timeline.
                     Let's start with the definition of a design roadmap. A roadmap is
                     defined as: a visual portray of design innovation elements plotted on a
                     timeline1. Elements such as user values, new products and services but
                     also market segments, technoloy applications and touchpoints. Each
                     roadmap has its particular format and visualisation2,7,8. An example
                     in figure 1.1 shows a service roadmap for a digital food service of a
                     grocery organisation. Design studios all over the world, from Denmark to
                     Australia and from Korea to the US, are experimenting with roadmapping.
                     Each finding their own style in plotting the basic elements of value,
                     product-, market- and technology choices on the timeline 3,4,5. Figure
                     1.2 provides a schematic overview of the typical elements included in a
                     design roadmap. Depending on the context and the designer's signature,
                     each roadmap design has its particular format, specific additions and
                     signature visualisation. Figure 1.4 shows another example of a design
                     roadmap.

                             Roadmaps not only provide strong visualisation and decision
                     making support - they foremost enable organisations and designers to
                     devise creative responses to future strategic challenges3. A roadmap
                     supports the innovation strategy of an organisation, because the
                     decision making for a roadmap involves the creation, exploration and
                     convergence of ideas about the future6. In essence, a roadmap offers a

                     Underlying design roadmapping is a process of diverging and
                     converging activities structured in three stages. You can carry out three
                     main mapping activities, starting with `Value mapping', followed up
                     by `Idea mapping' and ending with `Pathway mapping'. As outcomes
                     of your roadmapping efforts, stage 1 aims for a shared future vision,
                     stage 2 a design roadmap and stage 3 a design program roadmap.
                     Depending on your role, the business context and the number of people
                     involved in the roadmapping team, the key activities can be organised
                     and subdivided into tasks to be undertaken by a single person or a
                     group. Team members share their findings and knowledge during one
                     (or more) roadmapping sessions per stage. Additional tasks tailored to
                     a particular context or strategy intent can be added. Figure 1.3 shows
                     the baseline of the roadmapping process - you may want to use it as a
                     guide when organising and preparing the creation of a new roadmap.

     Value Mapping

                     Roadmapping starts with value mapping. First you can conduct a
                     creative trend research, a divergent design research activity intended
                     to establish a future outlook on the environment of your organisation.
                     The trends provide potential directions of new opportunities of value
                     creation. After several members of the roadmapping team have
                     completed their design research, the team converges around an activity
                     of sharing and accumulating knowledge about the future. This team
                     activity is focussed on creating a vision. The mapping challenge is
                     to create a value map that fosters a collective understanding of the
                     current strategic position and to grasp new value opportunities from
                     trends and technologies into a future vision. With the values mapped
                     out, team members can more easily decide which unique value drivers
                     they want to underpin their organisation's future vision. At the end
                     of this stage, the roadmap will have its destination: a future vision
                     statement grounded in unique value drivers.

     Idea Mapping

                     At the heart of the roadmapping process is idea mapping. During this
                     stage, the divergent activity consists of `technology scouting' at the
                     detailed level of service systems modules, in parallel to more in-depth
                     research into user value drivers. The results of this research provide input
                     for the team activity of idea generation. The mapping challenge here is
                     to generate ideas for user values with matching technology applications.

                     edge by better time-to-market. - a better competitive timing1.
                     Furthermore, beyond a single company, in a roadmapping context of
                     an industry network, roadmappers experienced that "combining the
                     resources across companies may make developing the technology
                     possible and consequently the industry more competitive - Sandia1."
                     Several roadmappers reported about a roadmapping process among
                     alliance members: "we saw a long-term positive development of the
                     entire branch-Aircraft Devices1."

                             Our research delved into twelve professional roadmapping cases
                     and concluded that there are commonly two performance aspects
                     where roadmapping had an impact on: (a) competitive timing, and
                     (b) industry synergy1.Roadmaps can be effective artifacts for your own
                     organisation or for your industry sector.

                             In a corporate context, roadmapping can boost innovation
                     performance in the marketplace, offering you the chance to improve the
                     competitive timing of your user value innovations. Properly timing the
                     entry of the new value innovations is crucial, and depends on taking the
                     initiative and setting the bar, or being responsive and reacting flexibly. For
                     an industry impact, firms that are actively involved in the roadmapping
                     process can all achieve greater innovation synergy and thus affect the
                     industry's innovation performance across the board.

     Competitive timing

                     Competitive timing is competition-dependent timing of new product
                     introductions in response to the innovation cycles and launch rhythms of
                     rival market players1. Competitive timing is not about performance over
                     time in absolute terms; rather, it is relative - it involves the launch timing
                     of new value innovations by the competition.

                             Generally, strategic managers prefer long response times, because
                     the longer the elapsed time between entry of the first mover and that of
                     later entrants, the more opportunities become available to the first mover
                     to achieve cost and differentiation advantages. Research confirms that
                     when firms research their competitor's activity, they are able to introduce
                     more distinctive products with a higher extend of innovation11. Studies

                                 crossroads rather than topography. All of this makes the Peutinger map a                         ranging from 15 meters to 15 centimetres. In figure 1.6 a Google Earth

     The Map of the Internet

                                A more schematic map that is associated to the digital revolution is the
                                map of the inception of the Internet. Figure 1.7 shows the schematic
                                representation of the Internet. It connects the Advanced Research
                                Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) in Virginia with the network of
                                Stanford Univeristy in the west the US, to the MIT and Harvard networks
                                on the east further across the seas to London and in the west to Hawaii.

                                        The schematic overlay's squares and ellipses resemble a sort of
                                basic type of subway map that has no intention of representing the exact
                                distances the data packets would be travelling - it merely existed to
                                explain how the networks would interlink. Visible interlinkages are also a
                                crucial part of a design roadmap's composition.

                                        The year 1974 of the Internet map demarcates the invention
                                of the TCP/IP by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn. By a long run of 15 years
                                later Tim Berners-Lee, then scientists at CERN, designed the World
                                Wide Web concept in 1989. According to Berners-Lee "The Web is
                                an abstract (imaginary) space of information. On the Net, you find
                                computers - on the Web, you find document, sounds, videos and
                                information.... The Web made the Net useful because people are really
                                interested in information (not to mention knowledge and wisdom!17".
                                It is interesting to note that the two perspectives provided by 'the
                                Web' and 'the Net' are necessarily intertwined, and interlinked. In a
                                way, roadmaps do the same, interlinking multiple perspectives.

                                design roadmap we also have several layers - we visualise the current
                                business, the growing business for which the development has started
                                and the future business on which research is taken place. The circular

                        - a kind of utopian view of the future - on the contrary, I think
                        that a very idealistic story is not a design as we see it. In future                             LS In roadmapping, besides formulating a future vision, we

HOW TO DO CREATIVE TREND RESEARCH

With the emergence of future foresight in the discipline of design, the attention for creative trend
research has increased1. It is also a trending topic online: several leading design bloggers believe
that creative trend research and future thinking are now needed more than ever. In roadmapping,
we practice creative trend research, which combines the designer's craft of intuitive observations
with the strategic scanning of the environment.
The concept of 'trend' has gone through several generations of meaning2:
 FIRST, the term `trend' is traceable back to the field of geography in the late 16th century,

        when the term 'trend line' was used to describe the general direction that a stream, coast,
        or mountain range tends to take. `To trend' is derived from the Old English trendan and the
        Germanic trundle, which mean: to revolve, rotate, turn in a specified direction.
 SECOND, studies of demographic data used the noun 'population trend' in a figurative sense,
        to determine a trend as a statistically detectable change in collected data on a population.
        Researchers developed trend analysis tools, which use large collections of quantitative data.
        For linear trend extrapolation, mathematicians advanced the trend analysis techniques, on
        which many forecasting studies heavily rely.
THIRD, studies on comparing groups of people in the social sciences gave rise to the term
        'behaviour trend' that was used to refer to a pattern of collective, socially influenced
        behaviour. In the 1960s, human-related trend research also became common practice in the
        field of design. The word 'trend' also became associated with a person: 'trendsetter'. Interior
        and fashion designers were among the first to be considered trendsetters. Then, the term
        'trend-spotter' was coined for people who observe, seek, or predict changing tides in media
        and material culture (fashion, design, etc.).
 FOURTH, social media technology ushered a new generation of trend term usage. 'Trend
        hypes', 'trending topics', and 'top trends' have become part of the daily communication
        referring to postings on for instance, Twitter, Youtube, and Instagram that are viewed
        thousands or even millions of times a day.
Considering all these disparate meanings, we concentrate in this chapter on trend research in the
creative fields of fashion, architecture, and industrial design. To offer further guidance on how to
carry out trend research, we present a framework that includes four techniques: trend scenarios,
trend views, trend topics, and trend patterns.

    Visual Trend Spotting                                                                                VISUAL TREND SPOTTING is counting instances of
                                                                                                         observed clues over time.

                     Often observed from a few weak signals, which are mostly visual in nature,
                     trends are made by people but uncovered by designers. Design research
                     detects the early signals of a vogue, swing, or drift in trend research:

                              VOGUE: a current style or preference, such as a new fashion
                                     trend.

                             SWING: a social movement, such as the shift towards food
                                     truck dining.

                     Strategists introduced `environment scanning'--the systematic scanning
                     of an organisation's business environment for relevant information10. The
                     purpose is to ensure an organisation does not miss out on early signals of
                     possible changes in the environment. Designers use strategic scanning to
                     detect trends of change already underway.

                             For strategic decision making, designers and futurists crafted
                     the trend technique STEP--an acronym for Social, Technologic,
                     Economic, and Political trends. You can use STEP to scan signals in a
                     global context according to Social and demographic developments,
                     science and Technology inventions, Economical developments, and
                     Political and regulatory changes. For initiating the vision of the roadmap
                     we recommend you to evaluate the trends on their unique potential.
                     The major challenge is to extract those trends that provide a unique
                     opportunity for the future of the business you are working11.

             to important trends and events which
             impact on the firm."

                     IGOR ANSOFF12

                     Igor Ansoff, the eminent strategy theorist, proposed that strategic trend
                     scanning should not only be based on extrapolations from statistical
                     data, but also must rely on more immediate observations that provide
                     initial and emerging indications of potential futures. He distinguished
                     between strong signals and weak signals. Some trends come with strong
                     signals and can be validated with data collection and statistical trend
                     analysis. Such strong trends have long forecasting horizons of estimated
                     impact, and therefore allow for building a knowledge base before
                     executing an appropriate response. Other trends come with weak signals
                     that appear more immediately in the present, as evolving signals12.
                     According to Ansoff, weak signals are of equal importance in preparing a
                     business for the impact of these trends.

                             Scanning weak signals involves heightened sensitivity and
                     sustained reflection on the potential meaning of those signals. Intuitively
                     sensing the importance of new observations requires professionals with
                     an open-minded approach towards the environment. It is no wonder
                     that designers and strategist adopted the STEP technique into their

    LIANNE SIMONSE, NIYA STOIMENOVA & DIRK SNELDERS

                     We position creative trend research between the two extremes of
                     visual trend spotting and strategic trend scanning and define creative
                     trend research as: " the act of understanding in combining and unifying
                     the isolated data of sensation into a recognizable whole of a trend".
                     Designers can capture a combination of visual and textual signals by
                     scanning the areas of interest, blending global and local trends, and
                     blending visual and statistical trends. The result is an intuitive and
                     creative type of trend research, which for the most part pertains to the
                     behaviour of people doing their jobs and living their lives14.

                             Figure 2.1 presents four techniques for creative trend research:
                     trend scenarios, trend topics, trend views and trend patterns. All these
                     creative techniques make use of trend synthesis. This is different from
                     trend analysis; whereas an analysis breaks information into parts in
                     order to identify causes and (trend) relations. A trend synthesis compiles
                     information together in a creative way, by combining parts into new trend
                     unities. The philosopher Kant has characterized synthesis as "the act of
                     putting different representations together, and grasping what is manifold
                     in them in one cognition - Kant15." The creative challenge in trend
                     research is to unite in one sublime trend, the diverse mixed media forms
                     of scanned bits and pieces.

                             We build the framework for creative trend research (figure 2.1)
                     with at the heart two dimensions of (1) synthesis and (2) intuition that go
                     hand in hand in carrying out creative trend research. Intuition allows the
                     trend researcher, the person who will bring either sensed or memorized
                     information together, to conceive a new trend. Intuition plays a vital role
                     because a trend projects future value16. All these creative techniques
                     are targeted towards identifying new opportunities for the creation of
                     future value. Through intuition designers disclose the visible elements
                     in connection to the sensed and memorized elements in trends. We
                     introduce the four trend techniques below with examples from our
                     readings in the literature, interviews, and work with students.

     Trend Scenarios

                     Generating trend scenarios has been described as an art, a craft,
                     and a learning process, all implying the use of creativity17,18. Creating
                     trend scenarios involves explorations that discover possible
                     occurrences in the future 19. "A trend scenario attempts to capture
                     the richness and range of possibilities. At the same time, it organises
                     those possibilities into narratives that are easier to grasp than great

                              Inspired by the sharing economy trend, two entrepreneurs in Amsterdam        PEERBY members.          formulated: "What triggers the interest in sharing?"
                              started Peerby, a company that provides a peer-to-peer lending service.                               In a team meeting all trend data was brought to the table and each

                              can be put to more use when shared. More than 200,000 people have                                     they formulated a trend theme.
                              become members of this social community service and altogether they
                              have registered over 1.5 million items that are available for sharing.

                                      Besides saving money, time, and storage space, the users of the
                              Peerby service also get to know their neighbours. Peerby's mission is
                              realizing 'instant access to everything, everywhere and for everyone'.
                              The entrepreneurs formulated their strategic identity by three pillars
                              that they strongly believe in: social cohesion, sustainability, and social
                              entrepreneurship. In addition, Anna Noyons, the chief product officer
                              (CPO), commissioned an assignment to create a design roadmap that
                              gains a longer-term perspective, supports the scaling up of innovation
                              efforts and most importantly contributes to a positive member
                              experience.

              Strategic trend scanning

                              A team of designers (all MSc candidates in strategic product design
                              at Delft University of Technology) took up this challenge and created a
                              roadmap for Peerby based on creative trend research. They explored that
                              the origins of shared services, like Peerby's, thrive on experience value
                              rather than ownership value. Building upon the popularity of sharing
                              services such as Airbnb, and its frontrunner, couch surfing, various
                              initiatives and new initiatives on product sharing pop up rapidly. The team
                              of designers found twenty sharing services on the web in the Netherlands
                              in 2013--and just one year later, in 2014, there were nearly two hundred.
                              In other words, product sharing is booming, with successful businesses
                              such as like Renttherunway (US) for sharing designer clothing and
                              GetMyBoat for sharing a boat. The trend is almost becoming mainstream
                              through this rapid increase of shared services business.

              Trend spotting on sharing services

                              For their trend spotting research the team gathered information from
                              different sources, ranging from daily observations to global news
                              magazines, from trend-watching blogs to a Forbes trend study and from

     Design Roadmap for PEERBY

                     The design team shortlisted 10 trends (see figure 2.2) and ranked them
                     on long term user impact and how Peerby could respond with innovations
                     (Innovation strategy fit). This provided inspiration and direction for
                     formulating the roadmap vision: `Circular community value' based on the
                     highest ranked trend: "Through the power of circling the products in a
                     neighbour community, they are kept longer in use by multiple cycling and
                     by lengthening cycling duration". Then they decided on which trends to
                     map on the market roadmap with a view to providing the most unique and
                     promising values for Peerby:

                      Betterness, authenticity, and cultural storytelling
                      DIY, local sourcing and additive manufacturing
                      Intelligent customer service - feeling of being cared for
                      Heritage chic--reinventing tradition and craftsmanship

                     In creating the roadmap, the team mapped these trends to the timeline.
                     Figure 2.3 presents the roadmap in connection to the trends. They
                     shaped the future direction, building upon the shared neighbourhood
                     service of lending and borrowing stuff, they could also create things
                     together. For instance, thanks to help from a neighbour, one participant
                     was able to build a table. They propose that Peerby should grow and
                     become a truly established community platform by emphasizing
                     more the interactions between neighbours and building their services
                     around environmental awareness in combination with the momentum
                     of the sharing-economy. To communicate this, the design team made a
                     roadmap that contains four horizons over a period of ten years.

                                                                                                                                      ANNA NOYONS is a strategic product- and service designer. After working as a design consultant for

                                           In this chapter, we positioned creative trend research between the two extremes of visual trend
                                           spotting and strategic trend scanning. We gained the insight that creative synthesis rooted in
                                           human intuition is the key characteristic of creative trend research. Creative synthesis unites bits
                                           and pieces of mixed media into a trend creation that imagines future value.

                                                   Creative synthesis can be established by:
                                                    Designer's view on foreseen trends (creative authority of the expert).
                                                    Visual pattern creation of captured images (peer-to-peer authority).
                                                   Re-perceiving the organisation's mental frame of reference (collective authentication

                                                            of trends by the involved experts).
                                                   Pattern creation from thin slices of documented memory (substantiated with multiple

                                                            evidence authentication).

                                           The synthesis is driven by creative authority or authentication of multiple sources.
                                                   With a framework four creative techniques are distinguished: trend views, trend scenarios,

                                           trend topics, and trend patterns on the dimension of intuition and creative synthesis. The Peerby
                                           case demonstrated the importance of trend research for the roadmap. The lab provides a do it

HOW TO DESIGN A FUTURE VISION

The leading question for designers to start-up a roadmapping process is: what is our future vision,
because that vision establishes the destination for the roadmap. Before designing anything, it is
important to discern its properties. Therefore, in this chapter we first take a deep-dive into the
properties and definition of a future vision. - what it is and what it is not. After that, we elaborate
on special kinds of future visions - ones that lead to inspirational artifacts like concept cars and
concept kitchens. These are in particular designed for the future exploration of and communication
about disruptive value innovations. In roadmapping, we consider such vision concept as the
ultimate future vision - Then, we discuss the role of designers in taking the `creative lead' in
formulating the future vision for the organisation's innovation strategy. On top of that we present
a special case story of future visioning in design practice. Flavio Manzoni, Senior Vice President of
Design at Ferrari shares his notions on taking inspiration from the future rather than building from
the constraints and legacy of the past.

    Future Vision

     Creatively expressing a desired future                                                              A FUTURE VISION is an expression of a desired
                                                                                                         future.
                     On a design roadmap, the future vision points to the destination. As
                     an expression of a desired future1,2,3,4, the vision provides a strategic
                     reference point - a focused direction that leads to stronger motivation5.
                     Visions imagine experiences of future innovations.

                             A vision's creative expression may be plain or elaborate, down-
                     to-earth and practical or dreamily utopian, and can come in the form of
                     graphic, video, artifact or written narratives6. Creative expression makes
                     the vision more explicit; in order to inform actions in concordance with it
                     until the vision is either achieved or replaced. Unlike a goal, a vision aims
                     to establish a tension between "what is" and "what could be" 7, so as to
                     provide direction for the innovations on the roadmap that lead to it.

     Imagining a desired state of the future: capture value wishes

                     A future vision imagines possible future experiences concretely. It listens
                     to people's wishes for future innovations and articulates them explicitly8.
                     A future vision holds imaginative, and dreams about the future. It can only
                     take root through true leaps of inspiration, which are sometimes based
                     on observed trends and identified opportunities, and sometimes on
                     personal inspiration or intuition. As Carl Jung, once said, "Your vision will
                     become clear only when you can look into your own heart . . .who looks
                     outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes4." Visioning is often seen as
                     the realm of the artist, the poet, the tinkerer, the futurist and the designer4.

                             Capturing wishes about the future as people would like it to be is
                     the art of visioning. People's passions, desires and aspirations can be

                     framed as future visions. For instance, a film fan who's "wish is to watch a                               C LARITY in the vision expression enables immediate
                     movie that feels like being there" inspired the vision driving a multimedia                                         understanding of what it would be like to experience
                     venture roadmap: make immersive movie experiences happen. The value                                                 the future innovation in the explicitly expressed desired
                     propositions for such experiences do not exist yet. The vision captures a                                           end state13,16,25.
                     value wish8. Value wishes express a desired end-state in which a novel
                     value fulfils an unmet need or resolves a present dilemma or feeling of                                    V ALUE drivers capture the key compelling benefits of value
                     frustration experienced by a user target group. Besides wishes for new                                              wishes: wherein the specific value fulfils an unmet need or
                     products, people's value wishes might be to alleviate the effort that goes                                          solves a dilemma of a user target group in the future8,14.
                     into annoying or "dirty" jobs, or perhaps reduce risk and feel safer8.
                                                                                                                                A RTIFACT, materialise the imagined value wishes with
     The strategic reference point for actionable innovations                                                                            images in 2D or 3D- dimensions15.

                     Visions also contain a specific call to action. "Dreamers dream about                                      M AGNETISM involves the desirability and attractiveness
                     things being different. Visionaries envision themselves making the                                                  of the vision - `the thing' the vision creators are truly
                     difference9." The vision not only imagines what needs to be different in                                            passionate about in such a way that it potentially energizes
                     the future - it expresses specific, achievable dimensions to making the                                             others to direct their actions towards it16.
                     difference. As Alan Turing said, "We can only see a short distance ahead,
                     but we can see plenty there that needs to be done10." Many roadmappers             A future vision is not a design vision
                     consider it imperative to develop a vision that includes a specific desire
                     for action as the vision channels the energy of the different innovation                           Design, as a discipline, has always been closely linked to the

                                                                                                                        In certain product design approaches, such as `Vision in Product',
                             Visioning entails taking a leap toward the future12. To get there,                         designers are encouraged to formulate a personal vision on the

                     might prefer a more risk-averse direction. In the theory on creating a                             formulated by the designer in an independent way, grounded in his or

     Demonstrate the vision with an artifact

                     To demonstrate a future vision, some companies create vision
                     prototypes, such as concept cars and concept kitchens. These vision
                     concepts are created to explore and discuss new strategic ideas
                     for innovation. According to designers at Citroën, concept cars are
                     like "laboratories for new ideas15", while designers at Volvo say that
                     "concept cars function as a test bed for new ideas15". The concept
                     prototypes bring a future vision to life and make it possible to
                     experience a future vision in the present21. In roadmapping, vision
                     concepts do more than showcasing the visions of the strategic
                     directions- they communicate the new values, test them by user
                     interactions with the vision concept and support the strategic
                     decision-making on the allocation of resources for future design
                     innovations8.

                             Although the embodiment of a vision concept can be quite
                     similar to a 1:1 prototype, the inherent visionary narrative that it
                     demonstrates is different from underlying build to test naratives of
                     ordinary prototypes. Parts of vision concepts might find their way
                     into new products, but a vision concept is not intended to provide
                     a model for a production prototype - "nor will it be sold15" stated
                     Philips designers explicitly in their write-up describing their concept
                     kitchen. Vision concepts are therefore different from product
                     development concepts, which unlock a problem and define the design
                     challenge in a new product development project. Vision concepts
                     are also different from emerging concepts that draw on proof-of
                     principles of technologies in demonstration prototypes often found
                     in pre-development projects. One step beyond these commonly-
                     known prototypes, vision concepts have a strategic purpose and are
                     specifically created to support a company's strategic decision-making
                     on future innovation directions15. In-company, the vision concept
                     influences and supports decision making on investments of additional
                     resources into further research and design21.

     Explore the future with plausible stories

                     A vision concept is a real, working artifact that demonstrates the
                     plausibility of a future vision22. The intention of a vision concept is to
                     explore the future potential and provide answers to research questions

     Taking the lead in visioning

                     Future visioning often implies leadership, especially when it comes to
                     shifting the vision from the stages of imagination and creation, to the
                     realisation. Studies have found that in environments characterised
                     by uncertainty, successful leaders are those who sustain an ongoing
                     vision23. And not just that - an effective leader must also strive to
                     strengthen the bond and attunement among group members24. If only
                     one person takes sole responsibility for future visioning directing the
                     course of change, it is not just creativity that may get lost - the team's
                     commitment to the vision may dwindle if participants do not take
                     personal pride in pursuing the vision24.

                             Research on leadership practice has shown that the abilities to
                     champion and secure a vision are harder to master than those of to
                     initiate and direct a vision23.For a vision to become a reality, there is
                     a need for leaders who master these extraordinary abilities - leaders
                     who are capable of communicating the vision and making sure others
                     "buy into" it, and who can transform a vision into the sustained effort
                     and ongoing cohesion required to make it a reality24.

                             Every single person on the design roadmapping team can
                     potentially exert an influence on the future direction of an innovation
                     strategy. At certain times, creative individuals, who are skilled at
                     imagining and visualising desired states, can take on a prominent role.
                     At other times, those who are more in tune with users and their unmet
                     desires can be the ones to take the lead. And then, individuals who are
                     strong programmers and can make sense out of ideation sessions can
                     be the ones to inspire others to transform their ideas into realities. In
                     future visioning the designer can take the lead and catalyse the turn
                     toward the future direction by, for instance, sketching scenarios of
                     future use, identifying value drivers and visualising the vision concept.

     Turning the vision into reality

                     Research comparing the success or failure of new products on
                     having a vision in advance has shown that radical innovations with
                     a clear vision and a degree of flexibility built into project plans
                     were the most successful25. A clear vision gives innovators a well-
                     articulated, easy to understand target - a very specific goal that
                     provides direction to everyone in the organisation. For example,
                     the vision in the US space program, was to "put a man on the moon
                     and return him safely to earth by the end of the decade." This vision
                     easily helps others to create a clear image of what the innovation is

                                      for instance showcasing the vision concept (a concept car,
                                      concept kitchen etc.) or another type of artifact15.

                     According to Harvard and MIT Professor Deborah Ancona, good
                     leaders are those who are able to frame visions along certain key
                     value dimensions. She encourages leaders "to practice creating
                     and communicating a vision in many arenas, and enable co-workers
                     by pointing out that they have the skills and capabilities needed to
                     realise the vision26". In this way you can effectively nurture vision
                     creation into realisation.

     Securing commitment

                     Attaining support for the future vision means securing the
                     commitment of people throughout the organisation for what the
                     overall vision is trying to achieve. When everyone is more than willing
                     to pitch in and help realise a vision and will do whatever it takes to
                     achieve that goal, the vision is securely supported.

                             Securing the vision includes the communication aimed at
                     reducing individuals' natural resistance when they perceive that
                     change is being imposed upon them24. Two important encouragements
                     in these situations are: to `suspend instant disbelief' and to
                     concentrate on the long term aspect of the future vision for which
                     the roadmap supports achieving stability, by providing consistency of
                     the vision over time8. To secure commitment - the roadmapping team
                     must operate as a well-oiled machine. This is possible when team
                     members transcend traditional function requirements, and cultivate
                     a greater sense of community, trust, respect and shared values in the
                     interest of getting the job done.

                             Overall, the integrative framework in figure 3.2 outlines the
                     leadership qualities that future visioning requires. In addition to
                     imagining and creatively expressing a desired future, the key skills to
                     master for turning the vision into reality are those of championing the
                     vision and securing commitment8.

FERRARI CASE  Spaceship Vision

              FLAVIO MANZONI & ENRICO LEONARDO FAGONE

                                 Flavio Manzoni is passionate: not just about his work, but also about
                                 futuristic, science-fiction inspired design. One of his signature
                                 projects was a study for a Ferrari-inspired spaceship, a creative
                                 exercise for his team in looking to the future for inspiration. While
                                 maintaining respect for Ferrari's heritage, he takes inspiration from
                                 the future, instead of building on the `retro' style legacy or existing
                                 constraints27.

                                         In 2015, Manzoni unveiled his concept for a super-futuristic
                                 spaceship. He designed the Ferrari spaceship as a carrier of his vision to
                                 design cars and products that reflect progress and evolution.

                                 "I tried to imagine something that can
                                  fly into the future, since there will be
                                  less and less space available on the
                                  ground, and I focused on creating a
                                  little craft that's different from my
                                  childhood dream32."

                                 In his opinion, the artefacts created for it, such as the drawing and the

                                 in the future. He vividly remembers the feeling like the future was

                                 depends on how you face them, he does not think of them as a problem,
                                 because then the end result will be compromised. He considers it

                     twist to the meaning and creation of `timeless' cars. "Sometimes it's
                     not so easy to explain why we feel that a particular design solution is
                     the correct one. Normally I follow this principle: if the form follows the
                     function, and our work is innovative, then we are safe. The problem is
                     when you try to make something stylish, when you have a preconceived
                     idea of the form, then it becomes an ornamental treatment30." In his
                     view this is never timeless. When, instead, there is a clear connection,
                     a clear match between the form and the substance, then it is different
                     and the result can be timeless. He wants the team to imagine when they

                     Giving form to a future visioning project is quite a difficult task, because
                     although the ufo-idea that he had in mind when they started the
                     project was quite clear, it wasn't clear how they could squeeze in all the
                     requirements, all that technical complexity. They found inspiration in this
                     quote from the architect Oscar Niemeyer: "It must be extraordinary not
                     only in terms of performance, but also extraordinary in terms of beauty. I
                     recall you saying that the voids are as important as the solids 31."

                             For this project they found a new way of designing by modeling
                     the airflow, because once we knew what the behaviour of the air
                     would be, then we could imagine the form. Maybe in a fifty years we'll

     GB W ell leaders sometimes have to be creative in getting things done.
           But a creative leadership kind of implies that some leaders are
           creative, and others are not. This goes back to the myth that only
           certain people are creative and others are not. I am convinced
           that all people are creative, although in different ways, and some
           are able to tap into their creativity more than others. The job of a
           leader is to leave room for creativity. The autocratic person who
           might be very visionary, often does not leave room for creativity. It
           is his vision, you are not allowed to be creative in terms of where
           we could go or how to get there. This type of leader is not interested
           in getting commitment to their vision; they are only interested in
           having it implemented.

                                                     Future visioning is about imagining desired values that are actionable and within reach of the
                                                     participating innovation professionals. In this chapter, we have provided answers to the question of
                                                     how to design a future vision. It all starts with determining the properties of the future vision.
                                                     The three core elements of a roadmap's future vision are:

                                                              CLARITY in the explicitly expressed desired end state;
                                                              VALUE DRIVERS that capture the key compelling benefits of value wishes;
                                                              ARTIFACT that materialise the imagined value wishes;
                                                              MAGNETISM that energises others to aspire to its creation.
                                                     Next comes creatively expressing the vision in an artifact. We presented ultimate artifacts
                                                     that we term `vision concepts', which are nearly fully-functional, futuristic prototypes
                                                     (such as the connected concept car and the concept kitchen). Then we outlined the
                                                     abilities that define the role of creative lead for future visioning and highlighted some
                                                     leadership qualities the job requires. Important skills for the creative lead to master are:
                                                     IMAGINING, through dreaming and creative expression; SHARING, by establishing bonds and
                                                     maintaining attunement; CHAMPIONING, by driving ideation, implementation and networking; and
                                                     SECURING comitment until the vision has become a reality. Flavio Manzini's story inspires us to look
                                                     ahead to the future, take a leap into actionable dreams and forget about the past and its retro legacy.

HOW TO CREATE A TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP

Design roadmapping is rooted in technology roadmapping, which technology strategists invented
to manage the growing complexity of technologies. In the early days of technology roadmapping,
the objective for them was to make strategic choices on long-term technology research in
alignment with the strategic decisions on new business development. Nowadays, technology
sub-maps still provide the foundation for design roadmaps. Although in the digital age, not
every organisation has an in-house technology research program, almost every organisation
uses digital technology to aid product and service development. Therefore it remains vital for
designers to align the value drivers of the user sub-map with smart choices about emerging
technologies. Scouting for new technologies is one of the key activities to do this.

        In the first chapter we introduced roadmaps that depict new design innovations along four
layers of: user value, market, product and technology. The technology layer assists organisations
to forecast and plan for new technology components and modules. Its structure is based on the
partitioning of the system architecture.

        This chapter takes a closer look at this strategic partitioning and delves deeper into ways
companies uncover new sources of technology and can make technology evolution projections.
The design of the technology roadmap is guided by (1) the mapping of technology evolution (2)
the use of a modular system architecture and (3) source-based scouting. Paul Hilkens, the vice
president at Océ-Technologies BV, provides us with a case study that highlights the integration of
modular system architectures in technology roadmaps.

     Mapping Technology Evolution                                                                     MAPPING TECHNOLOGY EVOLUTION by building
                                                                                                      logical chains of scouted technologies.
                      The evolution of new technologies - the progress from invention, to
                      proof-of-principle, to prototype testing - can take years. To make optimal
                      use of emerging technologies, and harness new user value opportunities,
                      you can anticipate on these evolutions by mapping them. For instance,
                      we mapped the evolution of LED (Light-Emitting-Diode) technology for
                      Philips' wake-up light on the technology sub-roadmap. We placed special
                      emphasis on the 2009 moment mapped at the future timeline when the
                      proof of technology for "white LED-light" was to be expected - see figure
                      4.1 - because at that time when the roadmap was created, in 2005, there
                      was only proof of technology for coloured LED lights. Before applying the
                      white light LED technology into the wake-up light that (was introduced
                      with incandescent light technology) we mapped the application of
                      subsequently, energy-efficient halogen light technology, mapped on the
                      year 2006, and durable compact fluorescent light technology, mapped on
                      the year 2007.

                      The mapping of technology evolution has three main activities:
                              (A) Out-of the box scouting to discover new and promising
                                       technology applications that support the visionary direction;

                      innovations. A decision grid can guide the strategic choice (see figure 6.5 ).
                      For choosing the technology application options with the highest potential
                      two criteria are used. 'Is the impact on user value real?' and 'Can we do it?'.
                      Only high user impact and high strategic fit options are selected for mapping
                      on the technology roadmap. For the others, the decision is either to drop it, or
                      park it on a list for periodic review.

                              Second, the evolutions of only the strategic interesting
                      technologies are mapped: those pertaining to distinctive components
                      that - with further development- can contribute to future innovations
                      and provide competitive advantage by creating new user value3. Such as
                      for example, the user interface (UI-)module in the Lucent roadmap, shown
                      in figure 4.3, maps the evolution of `keypad' into `softkeys' and after
                      that the application of `voice recognition'4. Depending on the decisions
                      of the roadmapping team, an evolution is sometimes an extrapolation,
                      sometimes a jump to a new breakthrough or disruptive technology and
                      sometimes an evolution in technology performance. Roadmapping such
                      technology evolutions thrives on gathering substantial input by out-of-
                      the box and in-depth scouting.

     Modular System Architecture - the radar

     To effectively identify new technology options, you will find it                                   a MODULAR SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE specifies the
     advantageous to gain some preliminary technical know-how regarding                                 partitioning of the functionalities of a system into
     the modular system architecture . Mapping technology evolutions of,                                specific modules, and their interfaces.
     for instance, personal computers (PCs) involves scouting for upcoming
     updates to modular components, such as the microprocessor chip, hard
     disks, memory chips, display, graphics card, speakers and so on. The
     modular system architecture makes it possible for roadmappers to map
     out innovations to a product line or a family of products and services with
     successive versions of upgraded products2.

             Technology scouts consider their system architecture as a kind
     of radar that provides a scope to detect and track changes in relevant
     technological areas, including at the fringe areas. In essence, the
     architecture defines the essential technical structure of the system; it
     specifies the partitioning of the overall functionalities of a system into
     specific functional components3 . Modular architectures, characterised
     by a `one-to-one' coupling of function and module, allow for agile
     design of a single module independently of the other modules7. The
     next versions of the new product replaces a module with the latest
     innovations in technologies . Modular architectures enable long-term
     flexibility of upgrading products with distinctive and desirable modules
     without the need to completely redesign the whole system3,7. The design
     of a modular architecture commonly requires a project effort of a system
     architects2.

      Strategic partitioning

                                   When scouting for potential technology options, the strategic
                                   partitioning of the system architecture is critical2. Strategic partitioning
                                   requires that the technical deconstruction of the system allows
                                   each module to be coupled to a unique function or feature and also
                                   to particular groups of targeted customers3. Once that strategic
                                   coupling to a module can be arranged, module upgrades of targeted
                                   product enhancements within one product line can be realized. When
                                   user values can be 'contained' within a single module in the system

                                                 of future product lines3.

                                 By following these steps, the roadmapping team at Sonicare invented
                                 a strategic system architecture composed of six modules - sketched
                                 in Figure 4.5 -: (1) bristle unit, (2) housing unit, (3) power unit with
                                 integrated drive and battery, (4) printed circuit board unit, (5) charger
                                 unit and (6) stand unit. Their technology roadmap plotted the
                                 technological evolution of each module. Each technology module was
                                 linked to one of seven new product types to be offered in specific
                                 design variations covering major retail price points from 15 to 79
                                 over a three-year time pacing horizon, from 2001 to 2003. According
                                 to Professor Sanchez, "In essence, the flexibility of a modular
                                 architecture to configure a range of strategically desired product
                                 and service variations and upgrades happens by system architecture
                                 design - as a matter of strategic intent - not by luck3."

      Team decisions on strategic modules

                                 One baseline decision for designers in mapping the scouted technologies is           MODULAR
                                 to decide: which parts, components and modules are of strategic interest           COMPONENT
                                 to in-house innovation efforts, and which parts are more common and
                                 thus easily purchased from a supplier. Effective mapping of the technology                              Module 1     Module 2             Module 3
                                 system architecture requires designers to work closely with strategic
                                 managers. Doing so, they ensure that they can sharpen the definition of
                                 their specific goals and ambitions for new business growth, and they also

                              In roadmapping, the technology scouting is not just concerned
                      merely with the designs for the first generation product or service,
                      but also with the mapping of future generations of products and
                      services. In fact, in technology scouting, extensive collaboration with
                      supply chain managers can have a powerful influence on the future
                      time performance of new products. Close connections in the supply
                      chain enable effective sourcing for complete new module engineering
                      and design9. Designers who fully grasp the opportunities and future
                      implications of alternative product and service designs can better
                      support the choice to pursue in-house designs, off-the-shelf designs
                      or strategic partnership designs9. Therefore regular interactions with
                      supply chain professionals help designers develop the insight into the
                      most advantageous ways of strategically partitioning the technology
                      roadmap by means of a system architecture and improve aspects of
                      supply chain performance that are strategically important.

     Source-based Scouting

                      Technology scouting relies on formal and informal information sources
                      including the scout's personal network, internet databases and any
                      personal observations made during trade events, supplier visits or
                      shopping trips. Instead of simply executing a randomly generic Google
                      search, setting the scope of the search in advance will help your scouting
                      results benefit1. For effective in-depth scouting, it is very useful to think
                      about a list of trusted sources of technology development, drawn from

                      the most used sources in technology scouting are (a) supplier sources, (b)
                      patent sources and (c) technology labs.

      Suppliers sources

                      An initial listing of preferred suppliers for your strategically-important
                      modules provides a good starting place for downstream scouting2.
                      Besides consulting the websites of the suppliers there are several
                      interesting purchase databases that can lead to valuable search results
                      regarding new components and modules. Most renown is ALIBABA.
                      com. It is also worthwhile discussing state-of-the-art technologies and
                      future options with the managers and technology experts at supplier
                      firms. Tradeshows are another source of valuable information - visiting
                      a tradeshow almost always yields an interesting overview of the markets
                      your suppliers deal with and important observations about upcoming
                      innovations in technology modules and beyond. Make sure to document
                      your observations with photos and notes.

     PM Concerning strategy and creating `decision space', the goal is                                     PLATFORM ROADMAP
            to overcome fixation and this question raises the issue: Which
            sources will help roadmapping teams overcome it? There are so
            many knowledge sources available in today's world of data and
            open innovation - Designers should learn to make use of data
            science and data intelligence to fuel surveys, networking, open
            innovation, contests and a wider involvement in scientific and
            design communities. But that still isn't enough! As we know from
            design theory, new knowledge also comes from new concepts:
            Having a creative imagination, and a capacity to formulate 'crazy
            concepts' is important, because these are the kinds of ideas that
            lead to 'crazy' questions about who can provide the appropriate
            knowledge, data or solutions. Designers should get to know
            about the 'crazy' ideas in their fields by visiting design schools,
            design studios and any other place where imagination is at work!
            Designers can also use 'smart browser' enhancements that
            suggest the key terms they need - but may not be familiar with
            - to investigate a certain topic14. Even a smart web browser can
            support absorptive capacity! Designers would do well to keep
            these kinds of tools in mind .

                       LS M y last question is: what is your advice to design
                            roadmappers who are mapping new technology
                            applications to product service systems?

     PM Be rigorously creative. Design roadmapping is the capacity to
            systematically formulate every imaginable future. Thanks to
            contemporary design theory we know that this work can be
            carried out rigorously, and thanks to advances in cognition we
            know that without rigour, we tend to become fixed. This is why we
            need processes, techniques and guidelines for organisations, like
            the ones described in this book!

                                                     Technology Scouting includes a higher level of detail than simply tracking technological trends.
                                                     In this chapter, the focus was concentrated on the usefulness of system architecture. Modular
                                                     architecture provides the structure needed to map technology evolutions and also serves as the
                                                     radar for the technology scouting activity.
                                                     We gained knowledge on:

                                                              The mapping of technology evolutions such as in lighting and display technology;
                                                              The difference between out of the box scouting and in-depth scouting;
                                                              The usefulness of a tear down to generate a basic system architecture;and
                                                              The different types of sources to include in a technology scouting research.

HOW TO DECIDE ON THE TIMELINE INTERVALS

In history class, timelines are introduced to enable storytelling about development and
evolution. In roadmapping, the timeline design has a similar purpose, but instead of
concentrating on the historic past, the timeline addresses the future. The timeline on the
roadmap allows designers to create stories about development and evolution of future
products and services.

        Time in the classic period has been a favourite subject among philosophers. Aristotle
talked about chronos as the sequence of time, the passing of time. He defined chronos as
the 'number of motion in respect of before and after' in Physics 219B (IV xi)1. His notion of
time can be measured, is dynamic, and has a chronology, a timeline. Plato, on the other hand,
drew attention to time as kairos: a moment of opportunity in which choices can be made, the
opportune time. Kairos, according to Plato, is the right time when something of importance can
happen based on decisions concerning future action1. Both notions of time come together in
roadmapping. The timeline in a roadmap focuses on the future chronology of chronos and the
pacing of kairos opportunities of innovation. Rather than linear stories, roadmapping favours
parallel stories about future scenarios that connect to the vision.

        In the roadmapping undertaking, you need to decide upon the length of the timeline,
how far the vision will be projected to a future point in time, and over what time intervals
new design innovations are mapped. The scope of the roadmap, its industry context, and its
strategic innovation cycles are important parameters in this decision.

        In this chapter, the design of the timeintervals for the foresight of innovations is guided
by three decisions on the strategic horizons and the moments of transition, the designed
rhythm of innovation--the design clock--and the time performance.

     Horizons of Strategic Life Cycles                                                               HORIZONS mark transitions of the strategic life
                                                                                                     cycles of business innovations.
      Three Horizons

                      Of particular help in parallel storytelling is the futures technique
                      of the Three Horizons model2. This technique comprehends three
                      parallel scenarios based upon three different life cycles of strategic
                      business innovation. These life cycles overlap, as modelled in figure
                      5.1, to create continuous innovation on the long term3. Each life
                      cycle conceptualizes new business development. The first starts in
                      a current business with existing market and existing technologies
                      and concentrates on innovations of design value enhancements.
                      The third, projects new value propositions in a new market with new
                      technologies. The cycle in-between is the stepping stone towards
                      either a new market by new user value segmentation or by totally new
                      technology applications that are user-tested in an existing market.
                      Ideally, these major strategic cycles are managed with a continuity of
                      smooth cycle transitions, to maintain continuity in turnover3.

in the film industry. It means
that the duration of a scene
portrays exactly the same time
as it took to film it. I play with
that concept in my Real Time

the hands of time are literally
moved in real time" - Maarten

                      one of them has been accepted by a critical mass of users and the
                      unsuccessful alternatives can be discontinued.

                              On a roadmap, all three strategic life cycle scenarios can be mapped
                      to meet simultaneously the short, mid-term, and long-term business
                      development of strategic fit with its future environment. They offer three
                      parallel options for design innovation efforts projected on the future
                      timeline of the roadmap3.

      Venture case example

                      To illustrate the three horizons thinking, a team of design students
                      developed a case example based on the venture Kamibot (see figure
                      5.3). Kamibot is a venture that makes programmable papercraft robots
                      for kids and has raised capital on the crowd funding site Kickstarter. The
                      Kamibot robot teaches kids how to code in a fun way. They can customize
                      their toy with their own code and colourful paper skins.
                       For the Kamibot venture, the first horizon scenario of incremental
                      innovation involves updating the robot. To prepare it for future
                      generations, the team considered that it is crucial to enhance it with
                      coding software for children.
                       For the third horizon scenario, the team created a vision for
                      Kamibot: 'Empower children to design and program their own toys'. As
                      driving values in this vision, they defined (a) stimulate creativity, (b)
                      learn 3D design, and (3) make the toy more personal. To enable this, the
                      team selected promising technologies: 3D programming for kids and the
                      launch of a new service for drawing your own robot in 3D.
                       For the second horizon scenario, the innovation concerns a next
                      generation of Kamibots that makes use of 3D-printing technology for
                      kids. This scenario includes the path of a new service: of a 3D model
                      store. Another alternative path of innovation that will also be tested in
                      this second horizon is the introduction of robot learning.

                              The team translated the scenarios of the three horizons into
                      choices that captures the main product, service, and technology
                      elements by plotting them on a 10-years-timeline on the roadmap as
                      illustrated in figure 5.3.

                      On the roadmap, the envisioned launch of a new product or service
                      is often demarcated with a specific point in time that relates to an

                      guide the time pacing of these value creations by design:

                       DESIGN CLOCK OF VALUE ENHANCEMENT
                      The value enhancement of model year changes often includes a new
                      shape, colour, or extra features, each of which enhances the design
                      value of the product or service. This type of design innovation thrives
                      on incremental changes on a product line or service family positioned
                      in an existing market with existing technologies. Its time pacing is fast,
                      focused on bringing a new version to the market. The update rhythm
                      accommodates this fast speed of innovating by design value.

                       DESIGN CLOCK OF USER-CENTRED VALUE CREATION
                       User-centred value creation thrives on design research dedicated to
                      insights about the desires and dilemmas of users. New insights on
                      emotional and functional values allow designers to create new market
                      segments for new products and services that differentiate from the
                      existing product/market combination. It's design clock relates to a new
                      market segment established by a newly discovered value insight that
                      delivers the new meaning. Its time pacing is moderate as this type of
                      value creation concerns a next generation solution design that also might
                      incorporate the application of evolutionary technologies. The update
                      rhythm of new user-value solutions often takes a number of years.

                       DESIGN CLOCK OF VALUE PROPOSITION CREATION
                      The value in value proposition creation encompasses a broader impact,
                      including the new organisation design of the value chain.Creating new
                      value propositions often requires a new business model that integrates
                      new technologies with new markets. The time pacing is therefore much
                      longer, taking a rhythm of several years for new business development.

                              The three 'design clocks' for different modes of design innovation
                      offer roadmappers options for the time pacing of different design
                      innovation efforts in the roadmap3. For the rhythm of new products or
                      services, time stones can be mapped on the timeline of the roadmap5.

      Time Performance of product visions

                      In the film Back to the Future, Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel to the
                      future of Wednesday, October 21, 2015. This particular future point in
                      time marked the future context with many fantastic products, such as
                      flying cars, self-tying sneakers, and hovering skateboards. Some of these
                      have come close to today's reality and others appear to be far beyond.
                      Among the product visions from this 1985 film that have become reality
                      by 2015, are 3D movies watched with VR goggles, fingerprint biometrics
                      technology, and fax machines9.

                              There are also product visions that have not become reality, such
                      as smart clothes from which we see only some emerging signs today,
                      but not the imagined adjustable size, self-drying, and programmable
                      properties that were part of the film. Also, the movie's 'Dust-repellent
                      paper' is not something we work with nowadays. Then there is another
                      category consisting of product visions that have almost become reality,
                      and might appear in some form in the future, such as hover boards and
                      flying cars. So far, we have seen prototypes of these product visions,
                      such as the P4 flying car of Dutch Design Studio Spark, and the Hoover
                      boards, that now can roll, but might fly in the future9.

PHILIPS CASE  Wake up Light Roadmap

                                 The PHILIPS Wake-up Light simulates a sunrise with a gradual increase
                                 in luminosity at the speed of a sun rise. This product is designed to make
                                 users feel more energetic and refreshed as they face the day ahead.
                                 Since its successful launch in 2006, five next generations have been
                                 designed around this user experience, and it is now used by millions of
                                 people in homes all over the world. This story is about the roadmapping
                                 project that I carried out in the year of its first launch. It is a short story
                                 about a steppingstone towards the creation of a successful business
                                 with increasing sales growth. It all started with one product.

                                         The initial product design (see figure 5.11) came from Taco, the
                                 lead engineer who had put a lot of attention into the proof-of-concept,
                                 the functions, and the testing of performance quality. Art, the product
                                 marketing manager, chose France as the test market and the immediate
                                 lessons learned from the consumer response, including the opinion
                                 leaders of the press, concerned the aesthetics of the product. For this
                                 reason, I invited the lead designer, Bart, from the design department of
                                 the PHILIPS Consumer lifestyle division, to join the roadmapping team.
                                 He started working on the roadmapping vision by doing design research
                                 along the lines of the research work of Taco and Art. To complete the
                                 roadmapping team on future foresight expertise, I asked more experts
                                 to join: two technology experts from the PHILIPS Lighting and Corporate
                                 Research lab, and one marketing expert from the Market Intelligence
                                 department. We all came together to co-create the roadmap in several
                                 one-day workshop sessions.

                                   long uncertain stage. And from other research we know that
                                   radical innovations take more time to introduction due to more
                                   uncertainties. Incremental enhancements are variants on a known
                                   path. You have the overview of the steps you have to take, so you
                                   can estimate this more accurately. Remember 1999, the Prince

                                   In my experience from strategic workshops, one activity that
                                   always works out well is visualising the connections between the
                                   innovation project, or projects, and the innovation strategy. For
                                   this visualisation activity we used one set of cards to draw and
                                   write the projects on, and another set to visualise and describe the
                                   focus elements of the innovation strategy. This is often a revelatory
                                   experience for the managers involved - they actually see links
                                   missing, and there is often an overload of cards with cost reduction
                                   projects alongside only a few cards representing the heart of the
                                   strategy. Visual mapping really opens eyes.

174  DESIGN ROADMAPPING  175  Time pacing strategy

                         IN SUM

                         Coming back to kairos and perceiving time as opportune time, the Three Horizons concept offers
                         such a mode of thinking about the future. The three horizons describe three different spaces of
                         opportunity moments and focuses the attention on three parallel strategic life cycle evolutions.
                         Furthermore, the key in the answer to the questions of how to decide on the timeline design is in
                         the design clocks.

                                 Design clocks include three types of pacing for different types of design innovation. Model
                         changes have a cycle time of one year or two years, while platform innovation with new user value
                         creation has a cycle that is two or three times longer. New business development by means of
                         value proposition creation takes the longest, with a pacing time interval of six to fifteen years,
                         depending on the capability complexity of the industry.

                                 The pacing of design clocks in roadmaps is decided upon by user-driven target group
                         expectations concerning model year changes, by technology-driven performance measurement
                         indicators, or by design-driven value enhancements, depending on the type of design roadmap
                         in question. In industry roadmaps, the engineers around the table prefer to pace with an exact
                         technical performance measurement. In company roadmaps in the consumer electronics
                         and appliance industry, the pacing decision is also based upon the pacing of competitors. In
                         design roadmaps, these two tensions are bridged by user-centred pacing driven by target group
                         expectations. Design-driven roadmapping thrives on value creation.

                                 The guidelines of this chapter include the time-based framework of design innovation that
                         frames the three design clocks with three horizons of evolutionary design innovation. Its use was
                         showcased with the Philips wake-up light roadmap, also in a visual way by drawing the three
                         horizons. The lab provides a short guide to experience the art of time pacing.

HOW TO ORGANISE THE ROADMAPPING PROCESS

Elementary in the process of roadmapping is to create a mutual understanding of the promising
opportunities, the current positioning, the future vision and the pathways towards it. In order to
have constructive conversations, you can arrange a set of mapping session for your roadmapping
team. How to organise this is the focal topic of this chapter. So far, we have addressed the
diverging activities of creative trend analysis and technology scouting, and the converging
activity of future visioning and time pacing. In this chapter, we address the challenge of bringing
these together in mapping sessions.

        Mapping sessions enable the dialogue through the creative facilitation with maps, the
most promising innovation options are discussed, mapped and synchronised across-functions.
An experienced roadmapper at the gasoline company BP expressed once: "The structured
dialogue is essential to the foresight process; not be unduly sensitive to the opinions of
individual gurus, nor be over-reliant on existing organisational structures and power bases,
ensure discussions are informed, open, and objective to help greatly in making this consensus-
building process both efficient and effective1." Underlying the roadmapping process of diverging
and converging activities lays a process of consensus building. A process that is sensitive to
personal characters, styles of communication, attitudes and behaviour but also to structure,
creative facilitation and outcome.For your support, this chapter provides you with insights and
guidelines on the following topics:

         Organise creative dialogues;
         Facilitate the mapping in three critical sessions;
         Support strategic decision making.

The organisational challenge is to orchestrate a seamless chain of mapping sessions.

                      Many roadmappers subscribed that one of the greatest values of
                      roadmapping lies in the process of communication. The crucial
                      importance of using dialogues to talk about the future and share
                      imaginations, gut feelings and beliefs emerged from our research on
                      12 cases of roadmapping1. The majority, 9 out of 12 firms, explicitly
                      mention the importance of dialogues in roadmapping. Firms such
                      as Motorola, Philips, Lucent, Tata steel, Sandia, ABB and Lucas
                      Varity reported that structured dialogues are part of the consensus-
                      building process. As a senior roadmapper at Tata steel -Hoogovens
                      expressed: "A unified approach . . . promoted growing commitment to
                      the common decision1", and another roadmapper at Sandia, explained
                      the process of roadmapping as to:"Develop a consensus about a

                      Several roadmapping experts emphasized this underlying process of
                      consensus building. To fully grasp what that is, the legendary professor                        Unlike `discussion' and `debate', creative conversations not only cover
                      Schein, explains on dialogues of consensus-building, that they draw on                          speech but include a rich mix of visual maps. The visual mapping of
                                                                                                                      the contributions of the participants is crucial. In essence, roadmaps

                      important base for triggering innovative thinking.
                              To wrap up, facilitate a round of collective sense-making to see

                      the big patterns and themes - drawing insights by defining common
                      themes and attributes and identifying the tension points.

      Matrix mapping

                      The matrix technique positions, seeks and structures the relations in a
                      two-dimensional way. This technique supports a team's cross-functional
                      thinking on a strategic level with 2x2 matrices. The Dutch roadmapper
                      Groenveldt invented the innovation matrix as a base for roadmapping in
                      1986 and since then many variations on the matrix technique followed5.

                              Designers typically use matrix maps when they want to position
                      their design innovations with current - and new user target group, current
                      - and new technologies. In a team setting, design roadmappers make use
                      of a matrix to map interrelations between values, ideas, technologies,
                      products, functions, features, trends, etc. The matrix zooms in on the
                      relations between two layers of a roadmap. Such as the matrix map with
                      the value tree of a user target group on the x-axis and the propositions
                      features on the y-axis. Or a Functions-Technologies matrix, more
                      commonly known among engineers, with on the x-axis the functions of
                      the product line releases and on the y-axis technologies6.

                              For the matrix you select two innovation dimensions and prepare
                      the matrix map for a session in which you preferably invite equal as
                      much professionals with knowledge on each of the two dimensions. By
                      a pitch or short introduction of the items on the matrix, a discussion
                      follows on its potential for connecting to an item on the other matrix
                      dimension. More options or no options are also possible outcomes of
                      this discussion.

                              Matrix mapping creates a more detailed view on the interrelation of
                      the promising options for the future. Many roadmappers have designed
                      their dedicated matrices map for facilitating a mapping session on a
                      particular strategic issue concerning the roadmap.

     Three critical mapping sessions

     You can organise a design roadmapping process as depicted in figure                           Three critical MAPPING SESSIONS are (1) Value

     a minimal critical specification of a roadmapping process, we picked
     out three sessions. For each stage, one session: (1) the value mapping
     session, (2) the idea mapping session and (3) the pathway mapping
     session. These sessions are minimal needed for sharing the results of
     the main roadmapping activities. The first session is concentrated on the

                              The value mapping for this starts with creating an `agreed on' list
                      and a `disagreed on' list. It is important to reach consensus on the future
                      vision that can meet the properties of future visions: value drivers, clarity
                      and magnetism (see the third chapter). You might want to support the
                      value mapping by sketching the future images that are put forward by the
                      participants and build up a raw version of the three horizons roadmap as
                      shown at the wake-up light case (figure 5.13).

                              More than one session might be required as a follow-up to generate
                      clarity and consensus about the most important user values for the
                      future vision. As a follow up you can visualise the future vision and shape
                      it into an artist impression with the vision statement mapped as direction
                      for the draft roadmap.

      Idea mapping session(s)

                            At the heart of roadmapping is the idea mapping on user values in

                      user values and promising technologies harvested from the technology
                      scouting as the other axis. Then in subgroups the participant can work
                      on generating new ideas in connection to a specific user value, potential
                      technology option. With a chosen technique of for instance brainstorming
                      or gamestorming, the sub-team members can build upon each other's
                      ideas about future products and services. The ideas are mapped, grouped
                      and ordered around innovation themes and prioritized blank innovation
                      spots. In a second round of idea mapping the sub-teams are encouraged
                      to further clarify the meanings and back ground of one particular theme
                      of future options they want to bring to the table. Depending on the time
                      you reserved you can organise the agenda for this session in such a way
                      that subgroups continue with a second round of concept enrichment
                      in relation to certain parts of the roadmap and have a collective
                      presentation of the outcomes, or you choose to organise successive
                      ideation sessions on future concepts.

                              The decisions to be made in this session are about the concept
                      vision of the product/service. The concepts with the highest impact
                      on user value and the best fit with the innovation capabilities can be
                      selected for the blanc options of the time pacing strategy. Consider to
                      map one or two alternatives per strategic option on the draft roadmap, to
                      allow for a fall back scenario.

                              As a follow up you can visualise the product/service roadmap and
                      shape layers for the technology roadmap and the user value roadmap
                      (see the template of figure 7.3 in the next chapter). You can stick it on a
                      wall, for communicating about it in an informal way not only with those
                      who have participated in this session but also with the other stakeholder
                      audiences. We have experienced great benefits of doing this in a
                      dedicated room the so-called `future lab for innovation'.

      Pathway mapping session(s)

                      In this mapping session, the innovation program for the mid and long-
                      term is created and this explicitly involves the allocation of resources and
                      creation of deliberate order in a pathway. This mapping converges the
                      results of all previous steps in a draft design program roadmap through
                      the parallel alignment of the design roadmap and the program roadmap.

                              In this session you create the pathways of innovation and depict
                      the relationships between the innovation elements. Pathway mapping

                                       The first `fine tuning' round draws from the product roadmap.
                               You can create pathways of innovation by mapping the evolution of
                               product lines in small steps of logical updates. Then relate the user
                               value and the technology module to each of these steps and draw this
                               relation on the roadmap.
                                       The second `fine tuning' round brings in the resource constraints.
                               The financial constraint of the total innovation budget and the capability
                               constraint of the total work force on innovation. Also certain capability
                               limitations of specific expertise need to be addressed here. In this fine-
                               tuning activity you translate the innovation pathways into project activities.
                               You aim for creating a program roadmap that can be used, and updated in
                               strategic reviews and alignment meetings with partners and suppliers.
                                       There are many detailed decisions in this session about the
                               alignment of relations. The timeline supports the alignment in discussing
                               the synchronisation towards innovation targets of for instance launching
                               a product. The key decisions concern the strategic agreement on the new
                               products and services for the future and the projects to initiate for the
                               first upcoming year.
                               A follow-up activity of this session is to compose the project briefs
                               with elements from the roadmap. Other follow-up activities include a

     Decision making

      Strategic review: filtering potential options for the roadmap                                    Creating a roadmap involves MAKING STRATEGIC
                                                                                                       CHOICES, and filtering out unviable options.
                      Roadmapping involves making strategic choices. From all the spotted
                      trends and technologies only those that offer real opportunities and
                      are within reach of the available innovation capabilities are relevant.
                      A common practice in a roadmapping session is therefore to review on
                      strategic attractiveness and fit. In the particular context of strategic design
                      innovations, the attractiveness is determined by the potential user value8.

                                       IS THE USER VALUE REAL?

                      Is the most important question for pursuing capability investments
                      in design innovation. Numerous research studies on innovation
                      performance have confirmed that new customer value propositions
                      have only chance on success when the designed innovation solution
                      can connect as closely as possible to the user's need or desire. Then,
                      the second most important question in making strategic choices for
                      innovation efforts is8,

                                       CAN WE DO IT?

                      Does our organisation have the capabilities to offer the desired solution?
                      Or might we easily develop the newly required capability by leveraging on
                      our strengths. Innovation success has been proven to be determined by
                      the core capabilities of the organisation8. Therefore the two main criteria
                      that enable the strategic design innovation are the fit with innovation
                      capability and the impact on user value (see figure 6.5).

                              In a roadmapping session, this job of strategic review, can be done
                      by the participants, who rank the innovation options (for instance the
                      trends, or the technologies) in order of impact on the user value, impact
                      from high to low. Followed by a second ranking on the strategic fit with
                      the innovation capabilities. Plotted on this grid with two axes, the options
                      with the most impact and most innovation capability fit, are selected as
                      most interesting for building the roadmap.

                      low. (see figure 6.5) and three classifications on innovation capability fit:
                      major, significant and low fit. The decision for options with low impact
                      and low fit is to "drop from list". These options are dropped. Choosing

                         IN SUM

                         In this chapter, we have provided several guidelines to facilitate the mapping sessions. First to
                         talk about the future values and share imaginations, gut feelings and beliefs. Second to map user
                         values and new technologies to the products and services you envision and third to create and fine
                         tune the design program roadmap for strategic review and decision making.

                                 The three minimal critical dialogues we highlighted are:
                                  Value mapping session
                                  Idea mapping session
                                  Pathway mapping session

                         Prior to the sessions, we advise to carry out design research activities on, for instance trends and
                         technologies, or the strategic directions on time pacing. These activities in advance, provide the
                         input for the dialogue sessions. For the follow-up and consolidation of the collective decisions we
                         recommend a creative visualisation of the roadmap with artefacts of the future vision, the product
                         roadmap or program roadmap.

                                 To end, with respect to the facilitation of decision making across multiple innovation
                         domains; in this chapter we showed that design roadmappers use a decision grid to prioritize and
                         select new product and service innovations with the highest probability of overall success. The grid
                         provides support and transparency in the tactical go/no-go decision making process.

HOW TO VISUALISE ROADMAPS

Due to its visual nature, a design roadmap is a powerful tool in facilitating communication
between different stakeholder groups and across organisational silos. Yet, creating a visual
roadmap is much more than mere graphic design, it involves both designing a map-structure that
appropriately communicates the message of the future vision and its key innovations, and making
the map visually appealing. Visualising a roadmap requires a great deal of logical thinking and
creativity. Visualisation is certainly not something you do at the end, after the roadmapping
process is complete. Visualisation starts at the very beginning by figuring out which structure
will bring the clearest and most comprehensive overview.

        In many organisations today, roadmaps are created by technical staff who have in-depth
knowledge of technologies and project development but who often lack design skills. As a
result, the maps they create lack communicative power, which limits adoption throughout the
organisation. Applying a design approach to roadmapping offers the advantages of including visual
communication power to a roadmap, hereby achieving the following:

        Unravel complexity: design roadmaps make highly complex situations easy to
                 understand;

Enable cross-functional decision making, by placing innovations in context: it is easier
                 to prioritise projects and assign resources;

Better grasp the dynamics between markets, product and service offerings and
                 technologies;

         Highlight important events, such as strategic shifts, product launches and releases.
The ultimate goal of a roadmap visualisation is to make the innovation strategy self-explanatory in
its actions.
This chapter provides you with insights and guidelines on the messages you want to get across to
your target audiences, to visualise a roadmap covers both designing the structure and making it
eye-catching. It requires a great deal of logical thinking and creativity. Visualisation is certainly
not something you do at the end, after the roadmapping process is complete. Visualisation
starts at the very beginning by figuring out which structure will bring the clearest and most
comprehensive overview. The best roadmaps affect the viewer, are visually compelling and easy
to comprehend.

     Target audiences and communication needs                                                          TARGETS AUDIENCES with decision influence are

                      Creating a roadmap visualisation starts with identifying your target
                      audience(s). Each target audience has their own needs regarding what
                      they want to see and understand from your roadmap, which, in turn,
                      helps you define the level of detail required. The roadmap design shapes
                      the layers of information that members of your audience will use to make
                      informed decisions. In our experience, there are three target audiences
                      with different levels of decision-making influence1. The first audience to

                      Designing a roadmap template can guide you in achieving your
                      communication goals. The challenge is to find an easy-to-understand
                      structure that can incorporate the often large amounts of data and
                      relationships between the data. Roadmaps are information-dense,
                      your challenge is to make that information easy to absorb for different
                      target groups. The format and schematic overlay you choose should
                      help viewers to see things in context and quickly identify key topics
                      relevant to them2.

      Which format is best?

                      This is a tricky question. If you are a designer, you probably have good
                      graphic design skills, so your ambition would be to create something
                      amazing that everybody loves and uses. Designing a roadmap
                      template implies deciding on the number of roadmaps you will have
                      to produce3. If it is possible to achieve all your communication goals
                      using a single, easy to read, visually appealing roadmap - great!
                      Otherwise, you will need to design entirely different roadmaps for
                      different audiences4. Still, try to limit the number of roadmaps as
                      much as possible to prevent confusion within the organisation and
                      keep version control manageable.

                              Choosing the right medium - a poster, talk, video or website, for
                      example - entails understanding what you want to achieve and how
                      people will use it. For instance, the roadmap you present to senior
                      managers will primarily be used to communicate the company's future
                      vision and inspire them to get on board with it. The message will most
                      likely stay the same for a couple of years, which justifies the budget
                      required for a multimedia production. The same is true for the more
                      commercial roadmap intended for the network partners, as it leaves out
                      the most confidential information.

                              Programmers have a particularly restricting and challenging
                      requirement. They tend to use roadmaps as living documents - also
                      known as dynamic documents because they are always in use - and
                      thus the roadmap needs to be updated on a regular basis (often every
                      quarter, or half year) and each innovation team is responsible for keeping
                      their part up to date. Updated versions are typically shared throughout
                      the organisation in digital form - as PDFs, or as part of PowerPoint
                      presentations - and sometimes physically, in the form of printed

                      approach. It visualises innovations over time. This roadmap layout is
                      useful when communicating innovation plans to network stakeholders.
                      Since network partners are external to the firm, and often include the
                      wider public, there is not too much detail in the roadmap, and the
                      timing is merely indicative.

     Creating compelling visualisations

                      After the content and layout for the roadmap have been defined, your
                      next task is to use your graphic design skills to turn the roadmap into
                      an effective communication tool. This means designing something
                      that is beautiful, logical and inspiring. Make consistent use of colours,
                      icons and fonts, and limit the amount of text. The roadmap should also
                      communicate well as an element in a presentation slide or printed out on
                      paper. Your goal is to make the target audience feel interested, happy, and
                      upbeat when reading your roadmap. Good roadmap visualisations have
                      the quality of presenting information in a visually compelling and easy to
                      process manner. It is of great service to decision making if your roadmap
                      is easy to comprehend, graphically consistent and affects the viewer.

      Easy to comprehend

                      As you might have experienced yourself, 'a picture is worth a thousand
                      words'. Several studies have confirmed that adding visuals leads
                      to better outcomes (compared to text only). Recent research on
                      visual communication suggests that, at the most basic level, visuals
                      contribute to the impact of information by increasing viewer attention,
                      comprehension and recall5. Thus, content in text combined with visuals
                      is more likely to be encoded and comprehended than is information
                      presented in text only. Ultimately, the roadmap should be self-
                      explanatory. This can be achieved when the target audiences perceive
                      that the roadmap provides information they need in an effective way.

      Graphic consistency

                      There are no strict rules for designing a graphically consistent roadmap;
                      however, the following tips and tricks provide you with some useful guidance:

                              Less is more. If you want your audience to easily understand

                                         methods. So my question is: What do you consider                     and how many times we can renew innovations. We need to keep

                                         innovation strategy?                                                 try to only design things that have value in them. These meaningful
                                                                                                              innovations you can map on the roadmap. The most important thing
                   RV You know, the thing is - as regards innovation, designers make sense                    is that you choose to map not quantity, but quality. That you are
                        of things valued by users. They take huge amounts of information and                  critical on the innovations, you map only those new innovations that
                        make use of their imagination to really design what life is all about.                will be meaningful in the future.
                        Designers have the capabilities to take the users' perspective, and
                        really understand what they want and what is important to them.                                   LS And do you think it is possible to envision meaningful
                        This is surely different from engineering-driven innovation, where                                     platforms then?
                        business managers see things from the perspective of shareholders
                        and engineers from the perspective of machines. For designers,                   RV Of course, there is a big problem here, because over time in
                        innovation is all about meaningfulness. Then, because creating                        a changing world, what is meaningful changes as well. If you
                        value for the user is of course important for the innovation strategy,                focus on solutions, you will inevitably end up solving problems
                        designers have definitely the capabilities to shape. Not only to shape                that meanwhile have become meaningless. When I talk about
                        the solution, but certainly on the strategy level of innovation, to                   meaningfulness, I am talking about the now. All these things we
                        shape the direction.                                                                  live with now and that have changed our way of living did not all
                                                                                                              happen because we thought they would be possible now. We might
                                    LS M y next question is about your research13. You have                   have had a couple of ideas, take for instance, AirBnB - one little
                                         identified the importance of creating meaningful                     bit that was imagined in advance was about property sharing, but
                                         innovations. In roadmapping, the creation of a future                all other ideas relating to the meaningful experience of AirBnB
                                         vision is what gives the roadmap its direction. To what              services today have not been imagined in the way that is possible
                                         extent do you consider it is possible to map meaningful              now. I am also a little concerned about people who can look into the
                                         innovations?                                                         future and attempt to think about it in a quite linear way. Because
                                                                                                              then it ends up with new things that only build on what we know
                   RV First of all, you cannot really design a 'meaningful' thing, because                    already today. So, in reality, with meaningful innovation, the future
                        meaning is ascribed by users. The actual meaning is decided upon by                   is today, in the sense that, since the future did not happen, because
                        the users. But in that respect, what you can do is design a platform                  no one made them, I am not sure you can say something meaningful

          be different from what you give meaning. Meaning is a reflection of                                   be a team activity, or can it be an activity carried out by

          borrowed from the outside, since they enable us to achieve a target,                             LS For my last question, I'd like to know what you

          to engage with outsiders and have them propose new ideas; and                        and see that people change a lot and that there are dynamics in

          be visionary and 'think outside the box'. Instead, the design of a                   do not change - they only change in meaning over time. Second,
          meaningful direction works the other way around: from the inside                     stay connected with deep underlying values by reflecting on your

                         IN SUM

                         In this chapter, we have provided several guidelines to help you contend with the challenge of
                         visualising a roadmap, and creating a roadmap template.

                                 First by identifying the communication needs of your target audiences. They will use
                         the information contained in the roadmap in different ways related to their decision making
                         responsibilities. For example, making choices about strategic directions and high-level project
                         priorities requires less detailed information than deciding how to assign project leaders and team
                         members to specific projects.

                                 Second, we recommend that you sketch a roadmap template at the beginning of the
                         roadmapping process and then iterate further upon it as the process unfolds, by using it as a living
                         document during the creative dialogue sessions.

                                 A third recommendation is that you try to be graphically consistent and engaging with your
                         roadmap designs. The guidelines for this are:

                                  Use graphic elements and colours in consistent ways;
                                  Incorporate icons to increase communicability;
                                 Include a positive emotional tone to make your target audience feel interested, happy,

                                          and upbeat;
                                  Iterate on your design until you are happy with it, and feel proud of the result.

                         To get started we have provided several examples and templates, and showcased an inspiring
                         visualisation project carried out by Meld Studios. Ultimately, we encourage you to develop your own
                         signature roadmap style across a variety of media.
