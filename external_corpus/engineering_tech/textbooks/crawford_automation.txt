INTRODUCTION

In this case study you will apply structured problem-solving to address a common supply chain issue! What
first appears as the issue may just be a symptom of a root cause. In this case study, you will be presented
with a real-life problem that requires a structured approach to be solved effectively. This case is a collaboration
between the Conestoga Centre for Supply Chain Innovation and ATS Automation and utilizes the ATS
Business Model (ABM) approach to identifying and solving root causes.

   Structured problem-solving is a process that enables individuals and teams to identify, analyze, and solve
problems systematically. This approach involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more
manageable parts, and then using data and analytical tools to identify the root cause of the problem. Once the
root cause has been identified, a range of possible solutions can be generated and evaluated before selecting the
best one to implement.

   The structured problem-solving approach has been widely used in various industries and fields, such as
manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and education. It is a valuable tool for anyone who needs to solve problems
efficiently and effectively, regardless of their level of expertise or experience.

   In this case study, you will have the opportunity to practice your structured problem-solving skills by
working through a real-life problem that requires a systematic approach to be solved. You will be presented
with a detailed scenario, and you will need to apply the steps of structured problem-solving to analyze the
situation, identify the root cause of the problem, and develop and evaluate potential solutions.

   By the end of this case study, you will have gained a better understanding of how structured problem-solving
can be applied to real-life situations, and you will have developed practical skills that you can apply to future
problems you may encounter. Let's get started!

The New Supply Chain Manager

It was early Monday morning, October 2, 2022, and Priyanka Kaur was starting her second week as the new
Supply Chain Manager at Crawford Automation in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. She was thrilled when the
company offered her the job and still couldn't believe her good fortune. Before leaving India to pursue an
opportunity as an international student in Canada, with a chance to find a full-time job, she had already
completed a degree in Mechanical Engineering. In addition, she had several years of experience in the
fabrication industry in her hometown of Kolkata, India, including supervisory experience, so she was ready
for the role of Supply Chain Manager with Crawford Automation. Still, she couldn't help but notice the
culture at Crawford was almost exclusively male-dominated, which explained her response when HR called to
offer her the job, "Really? Oh my, I can't believe it! Yes, yes, I accept the position. Thank you, I am very
grateful."

   However, those concerns faded into the background as Kaur immersed herself in the onboarding process at
Crawford. The first week had been reserved for "new hire" orientation comprising the usual Human
Resources onboarding processes, touring the office area, meeting administrative employees, and training on
the company's ERP system (see Appendix A for the organizational chart). She also had an opportunity
6 | CRAWFORD CASE

to spend time with the company's General Manager, Hugh Robertson, who explained the company's history,
competitive marketing position, and strategic plans for the coming year.

   Her overall responsibilities included purchasing, logistics, and inventory management, and towards the end
of the week, she finally got a chance to meet her staff. Kaur has a small team of two-to-three employees in each
area, but it was clear they had their hands full and were pleased the company had hired a new Supply Chain
Manager.

Purchasing at Crawford Automation

Kaur had previous experience in logistics and inventory control and was comfortable with those
responsibilities. However, she had little direct experience in purchasing and was unsure in that role. This
became more evident when her Purchasing Supervisor, Kevin MacDonald, described the scope of their
department's operations, including the number of domestic and international suppliers involved, the
sophistication of the parts they ordered, and the logistics requirements related to ensuring supplier deliveries
were on time for production. Kaur realized the importance of that relationship when MacDonald mentioned
that supplier on-time delivery had been declining in recent months: it was currently 75% but the company
requirement is 95% on-time delivery.

   Kaur was determined to get down to business, and her first meeting was with Harvey Morrison, the Plant
Manager. Morrison had been with the company for over ten years and proved to be a wealth of knowledge
about everything and everyone.

   Morrison took Kaur on a tour of the Plant, explaining the various production processes underway. "Do
you have any experience in the automation business, Priyanka?" Morrison asked as they made their way
between several workstations. "A little," Kaur replied. "I worked in a metal fabrication company for several
years before coming to Canada. We specialized in the airline industry, fabricating wing and fuselage parts from
high-density composite materials for some of the largest airlines in the world."

   "Sounds interesting," said Morrison. "We may not be a `highflyer' like your previous employer, but we're
pretty advanced in our own way. Our customers are manufacturing companies, mostly consumer goods
producers but some industrial clients as well. When they need a new machine or automated conveyor system,
they come to us and ask us to produce it, and sometimes design it too. It could be a new machine to produce a
brand-new product, or a bigger machine to produce more volume of an existing product."

   Kaur stopped and pushed several large boxes aside to get a better look around. "So, all the people in this
area are working on the same thing?" she asked Morrison.

   "Could be," he answered. "But, keep in mind, we're talking about highly sophisticated machinery. For
example, right now we're producing a high-volume extrusion molding machine for a large consumer beverage
company. It's only one machine, but it will produce thousands of bottles per minute that will feed into their
conveyor systems and be filled with beverage products. A machine like this has to be built from scratch,
hundreds of different parts, most we design and make ourselves, but some come from our suppliers."
                                                                                                                                        CRAWFORD CASE | 7

   "I'm glad I asked," Kaur replied. "That gives me a better idea of the role my departments play in all of this."
Morrison steered Kaur back towards the office area, saying, "Well, now that you mention it, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about your department and some problems we've been having."

   "Oh, are you saying my employees aren't doing their jobs very well?" Kaur asked.
   "Look, Priyanka, don't take this the wrong way," Morrison said. "You saw how many people I have
working out there. Our customers pay up to one million dollars for some of these machines, sometimes more,
therefore they demand high-quality and on-time delivery. I'm glad the company hired you, it's no secret that
we have had some significant production delays this year because the supply chain department couldn't
arrange the delivery of parts and materials to meet my production schedules."
   Kaur considered this for a moment and said, "Harvey, thank you for the tour and the insights into some of
the problems in my department. I assure you this will be a top priority for me and I will look into it
immediately."

"Thank Goodness You're Finally Here.....!"

Kaur knew firsthand the importance of timely supplier deliveries from her experience in the fabrication
industry. Back in her department, she decided to talk to MacDonald: "Harvey Morrison just gave me a Plant
tour, and from his comments, I get the impression he's not too happy with some of your suppliers."

   "Look, Priyanka," said Kevin defensively, "these suppliers were in place long before I got here, so they must
know what they're doing. When things don't show up, I get phone calls from Mike Brown demanding to
know where his order is. Call the suppliers, and it's the same story every time. They tell me our orders were
shipped on schedule and that I should call the trucking companies or check with Receiving. I call the carriers,
and they say they don't have it. Then I call Paul Robertson and he says he hasn't seen it either. But between
you and me, I'm not sure he would know, so thank goodness you're finally here to help sort things out!"

   "What do you mean by that?" Kaur asked.
   "My team has been tracking missed on-time deliveries (OTD) for the last two months (see Appendix B
for Late PO data) and we have found the main issue is incorrect data entry; however, I am unclear on how
to present this data and what the next steps to improve the situation are. I know that receiving is one of the
busiest areas in the company and floor space is in short supply, so maybe they are having difficulty locating the
orders."
   Kaur was able to take a quick look at the Late Purchase order data the purchasing team has compiled and
recommended that a Pareto diagram would be the most effective method to show the data and explained that
she was going to introduce a tool called an Ishikawa diagram (commonly referred to as a "Fishbone") to the
team soon. Kaur was interested to see if anything in the data provided indicated their suppliers were performing
unsatisfactorily.
8 | CRAWFORD CASE

The Receiving Department

Kaur asked MacDonald to generate a supplier performance report for the company's key suppliers, then
headed back to the Plant to speak with Paul Robertson, the Shipping & Receiving Supervisor. The Shipping
& Receiving department was not included in her tour with Morrison, and she was curious after hearing
MacDonald's comments.

   When she arrived at the Shipping & Receiving department, she saw that MacDonald might have a point.
Boxes and crates of all shapes and sizes filled the area to the point where it was difficult to find an aisle and in
one of the receiving docks was a skid full of random boxes blocking access for any material handling
equipment (MHE). She asked one of the staff on the floor and was told: "I think that stuff came in yesterday
and it is all the receipts with discrepancies, so we are waiting for purchasing to tell us what to do with them.
When a shipment arrives we have to match the purchase order, with the packing slip, and the label on the
boxes. None of these boxes match."

   Finally, behind a solid wall of boxes, Kaur discovered the Shipping Office and, inside, was Paul Robertson.

                   https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/crawfordcase/?p=51#h5p-1

   Looking at the purchase order Robertson just showed her, Kaur realized this is exactly the same missing
roller bearing MacDonald could not find (see Appendix C - Purchase Order).

The Problem

Later that day, around 4 p.m. Kaur received an email from Morrison asking if she could come to the
production area. When she arrived, Morrison waved her over to one of the workstations.

   "Thanks for coming. I thought it would help if you saw this for yourself. We're supposed to install the ball
bearings on this machine today, but now we have found out we don't have any. The inventory records say we
should have two in stock, but we don't. Kevin tells me the supplier says they shipped our order three days ago,
which contained 15 sets of Part #: 9902233567 Roller Bearings required for this job. Orillia to Barrie is
usually next-day delivery with the trucking company, but Robertson says he never received the order." (see
Appendix C - Purchase Order)

   Kaur saw that Morrison was waiting for an answer from her and asked, "What do you suggest I do?"
                                                                                                                                        CRAWFORD CASE | 9

   "I don't know; I just thought you should see firsthand the problems we're having with some of your
suppliers," Morrison replied as he handed Kaur a copy of the inventory record. "I could ask Paul to drive up
to Orillia and pick up the part, but he won't get there before 4:30, and since this has happened before, Orillia
Components will charge us an overtime pickup penalty of $500 for a $60 part. And since there will be rush
hour traffic on Highway 400 at this time of day, he'll be lucky to get back here by 8 p.m. tonight, and I can't
keep my Production department on overtime waiting for him.

   Kaur thought for a moment about the supplier analysis she had just completed. "Harvey, it's too late to do
anything about this today. Leave it with me, and I'll get back to you first thing tomorrow morning."

The After-Hours Investigation

Before she left for home, Kaur needed to make a plan. How will she and the team determine what had
happened to the missing part and figure out what the root cause of this recurring issue is? She knew she
needed to see the issues firsthand and collect data to understand the extent of the issue and to set a baseline of
performance.

   One of the first things Kaur requested was a supplier performance report and the supplier performance
scorecards for the top five vendors. She was informed that the accounting department creates and publishes
scorecards and that the performance reports were not up to date. Furthermore, it would take accounting weeks
to gather, organize, and summarize the data. She decided to ask her purchasing team to perform the analysis.
Crawford's IT department has set up an analytics self-serve where managers have direct access to download
data directly from SAP (the company's enterprise resource planning system) directly into Excel to perform
analysis and data visualizations (Download the SAP data file [downloads an Excel file]).

   Utilizing the self-serve tool, Kaur was able to download the complete Key Supplier Performance report (see
Appendix D - Key Supplier Performance Report). One of the key findings she is hoping to see is whether
the Crawford purchasing team is providing their vendors with the required five day lead time (time between
the date ordered and date required) and whether supplier confirmation dates are consistently entered.

   Kaur wanted to do one more thing before she went home and waited in her office until 7 p.m., long after
the plant had closed and everyone had left for the day. Armed with a flashlight, a copy of the Purchase Order
to Orillia Components (see Appendix C - Purchase Order), and the packing slip from the receipt (see
Appendix E - Packing Slip) she went to see if she could find the missing roller bearings.

   Can you find the box containing the missing parts in this pile? When the box is located can you identify the
discrepancy between the Purchase Order, Packing Slip, and the box label?

10 | CRAWFORD CASE

As she walks towards the receiving area, Kaur is thinking, "The only way to solve this problem is to use the
structured problem-solving approach I was taught in school and has worked in the past. It is important that I
find the root cause to this issues, or else they will keep happening."

As part of Kaur's team, you will use a structured problem-solving approach to find the root cause of
Crawford's supply chain problems and help the team determine countermeasures that will improve this
situation once and for all.

Step 2: Identify the Problem

 1. What are the targets of on-time supplier delivery? Given the table below, graph the data and determine
      the performance over the past 12 months, by month and in total. Is there a trend or pattern (# of PO
      On-time / # of PO)? What is the identified gap?
Month      # of PO Receipts  # of Late PO Receipts  # of Supplier Scorecards Issued

Step 3: Investigate the Root Cause.

 1. Review and analyze the data collected on late purchase orders. (see Appendix B for Late PO data) -
      The team also conducted a follow-up study of a selection of problem purchase orders over the past two
      months to help identify the root cause, or causes, of these missing and late purchase orders.
        a. How does this data start to inform your understanding of the issue?

 2. Review the Ishikawa / Fishbone Diagram - The team did this as pre-work to inform this analysis. (see
      Appendix F - Ishikawa Diagram - Top Three Analysis) Multiple possible problem areas were
      identified under six broad categories, and following a team vote, the most popular were identified and
      highlighted in blue together with the number of votes each received. The three that received the highest
      votes are shown in Appendix F - Top Three Analysis together with an assortment of possible root
      causes for each. Review the 14 possible root causes shown in the Top Three Analysis against the
      information provided in the case study.
        a. Which three possible root causes would you choose to investigate further?

 3. What data provided in the case study have you used to support your selections for further investigation?
      Complete the supplier performance table shown in Appendix D (see Appendix D - Key Supplier
      Performance Report) to complete the report you must utilize the data from the provided workbook.
      (Download the Excel File with Crawford Case Data)
              a. What observations can you make from the completed supplier performance report data?
             b. Are there any relationships or connections between the supplier performance data that
                  support or contradict the possible root causes listed in:

                      Appendix F - Ishikawa Diagram,
16 | ACTIVITY: APPLY THE PRACTICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH TO THE CASE

                      Appendix B - Late PO data?

              c. Reconsider the question asked above -- "Which three possible root causes would you choose
                  to investigate further?" -- and based on the additional supplier performance data, identify if
                  your selections have changed from those you identified earlier? If so, why?

 4. Go to the Gemba. Kaur has decided that your team needs to look for the missing part 998223356, which
      the vendor said was shipped to Crawford Automation. You will need to review the PO and the Packing
      Slip for this part, which can be found in Appendix C (see Appendix C - Purchase Order), and
      Appendix E (see Appendix E - Packing Slip).
              a. Did you find the box?
             b. Why do you think the box had not been received?

    Step 3: Investigate the Root Cause Continued

      5. Conduct a Five Whys analysis and complete the table in Appendix G (see Appendix G - The Five
      Whys Template).

         There are four main steps to using the Five Whys template:
       1. The observed problem is documented to initiate the process.
       2. Use the template to document the answers to the following questions.

              a. Why (#1) is the observed problem happening?
             b. What Gemba evidence supports the answers generated?
       3. Continue the process for Why (#2) through to Why (#5) as required.
              a. Why (#2) are the answers/findings in the previous step happening?
             b. What Gemba evidence supports the answers generated?
       4. Repeat the process by asking up to five Why questions until the root cause(s) are identified.

Step 4: Identify and Implement Countermeasures

Using the Five Whys analysis, identify for each root cause a short-term countermeasure to ensure the issue
does not get worse and a long-term countermeasure to fix forever (process improvement).

 1. Does every action have a clear action, owner, and due date?

Step 5: Verify the Impact of Countermeasures and Start Again

It is important in this step that your next review meeting is scheduled and that the team begins to collect
the data to measure the impact of countermeasures.

 1. Choose one of the recommended corrective actions and identify which of Crawford's performance
      measures (as discussed in the case) should be impacted.
18 | ACTIVITY: APPLY THE PRACTICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH TO THE CASE

       2. For the chosen action, identify a performance measure that could be negatively impacted by the
            corrective action. For example, quality may suffer when operators are asked to increase speed.

 Notes: For the purposes of analysis you will need create formulae and use logical and summary
   spreadsheet functions to calculate the measures for the Key Supplier Performance Report.

 # of Purchase Orders: The # of Purchase Orders placed with each supplier.
 Purchase Order Value: The total value of Purchase Orders for each vendor
 % of PO Delivered on Time: This calculation requires logic. If there is no promise/confirmation date

   then a on-time order is when the Date Delivered = Promise/Confirmation Date. When the
   confirmation date is missing then an on-time order is when the Date Delivered = Date Required
 Average Order Lead Time - Lead Time = days difference between Date Ordered and Date Required
 % of PO with Confirmations - The % of purchase orders that had confirmation dates, summarize for
   each supplier
 % of PO Delivered Complete - A complete order is defined when the # of lines delivered = # of lines
   ordered

5-Step Practical Problem-Solving Process

The Practical Problem-Solving Cycle involves five steps:

 1. Start with a team-based approach. This should be cross-functional with a process owner.
 2. Identify the problem. Problem identification requires a goal (target), an actual baseline (the current

      state), a gap (the difference between the actual and target), and a trend (results over time).
 3. Investigate the root cause. Use data, the Pareto principle, Gemba, and the Five Whys methods to

      generate multiple potential root causes and likely root causes.
 4. Implement short-term countermeasures and long-term corrective actions. Short-term countermeasures

      are quick "Band-Aids to stop the bleeding" and are based on hypotheses. Long-term corrective actions
      are prioritized by their likely impact on the problem's resolution.
 5. Verify the impact of countermeasures and corrective actions and then start the cycle again.

Appendix F - Ishikawa Diagram

This Ishikawa diagram shows six broad areas of consideration and the potential root causes within each area.
The team cast votes to determine the most likely root causes, which are highlighted in blue, together with the
number of votes each potential root cause received. The six broad areas and associated possible root causes
identified in the diagram are:

 1. Mother Nature (Environment) - comprising possible root causes: Winter weather, Customs delays,
      Cargo bumping, and Supplier execution (highlighted blue with 10 votes received)

 2. People (Resource) - comprising possible root causes: Data management - confirmation not entered
      (highlighted in blue with 7 votes received), Data entry error by Receiver, Data entry error by Buyer,
      Process adherence, and Received out of sequence by Receiver (highlighted in blue with 1 vote)

 3. Method (Process) - comprising possible root causes: Supplier selection, Supplier relationship
      management (highlighted in blue with 9 votes received), and Purchase order re-approval / delayed
      receipt

 4. Material - comprising possible root causes: Incorrect freight terms on a Purchase order, Address book
      set-up, and Commodity performance (highlighted in blue with 1 vote received)

 5. Machine - comprising possible root causes: Purchase order issue due to SAP discrepancy, and purchase
      order receipt out of date

 6. Measurement - comprising possible root causes: How we calculate OTD - i.e. transit (highlighted in
      blue with 1 vote received), Supplier clarification of delivery date shipped versus date received, Movement
      and disposition time- QA inspection in building 2, No confirmation date received (highlighted in blue

Appendix G - The Five Whys Template

The template is a table with three double-column sections, one for each cause. Each cause is divided into two
columns, one with the heading Why? and one with the heading Evidence. The table has five rows with empty
cells to fill in the Whys and Evidence for each cause.

   There are four main steps to using the Five Whys template:

 1. The observed problem is documented to initiate the process.
 2. Use the template to document the answers to the following questions.

       1. Why (#1) is the observed problem happening?
       2. What Gemba evidence supports the answers generated?
 3. Continue the process for Why (#2) through to Why (#5) as required.
       1. Why (#2) are the answers/findings in the previous step happening?
       2. What Gemba evidence supports the answers generated?
 4. Repeat the process by asking up to 5 Why questions until the root cause(s) are identified.
