Preface

The book series Microwave and RF Design is a comprehensive treatment
of radio frequency (RF) and microwave design with a modern "systems-
first" approach. A strong emphasis on design permeates the series with
extensive case studies and design examples. Design is oriented towards
cellular communications and microstrip design so that lessons learned can
be applied to real-world design tasks. The books in the Microwave and RF
Design series are:

    · Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems, Volume 1
    · Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines, Volume 2
    · Microwave and RF Design: Networks, Volume 3
    · Microwave and RF Design: Modules, Volume 4
    · Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators, Volume 5

The length and format of each is suitable for automatic printing and binding.

Rationale

The central philosophy behind this series's popular approach is that the
student or practicing engineer will develop a full appreciation for RF and
microwave engineering and gain the practical skills to perform system-
level design decisions. Now more than ever companies need engineers with
an ingrained appreciation of systems and armed with the skills to make
system decisions. One of the greatest challenges facing RF and microwave
engineering is the increasing level of abstraction needed to create innovative
microwave and RF systems. This book series is organized in such a way that
the reader comes to understand the impact that system-level decisions have
on component and subsystem design. At the same time, the capabilities of
technologies, components, and subsystems impact system design. The book
series is meticulously crafted to intertwine these themes.

Audience

The book series was originally developed for three courses at North
Carolina State University. One is a final-year undergraduate class, another an
introductory graduate class, and the third an advanced graduate class. Books
in the series are used as supplementary texts in two other classes. There
are extensive case studies, examples, and end of chapter problems ranging
from straight-forward to in-depth problems requiring hours to solve. A
companion book, Fundamentals of Microwave and RF Design, is more suitable
for an undergraduate class yet there is a direct linkage between the material
in this book and the series which can then be used as a career-long reference
text. I believe it is completely understandable for senior-level students
where a microwave/RF engineering course is offered. The book series is a
comprehensive RF and microwave text and reference, with detailed index,
appendices, and cross-references throughout. Practicing engineers will find
the book series a valuable systems primer, a refresher as needed, and a
vi  PREFACE

    reference tool in the field. Additionally, it can serve as a valuable, accessible
    resource for those outside RF circuit engineering who need to understand
    how they can work with RF hardware engineers.

    Organization
       This book is a volume in a five volume series on RF and microwave

    design. The first volume in the series, Microwave and RF Design: Radio
    Systems, addresses radio systems mainly following the evolution of cellular
    radio. A central aspect of microwave engineering is distributed effects
    considered in the second volume of this book series, Microwave and RF
    Design: Transmission Lines. Here transmission lines are treated as supporting
    forward- and backward-traveling voltage and current waves and these
    are related to electromagnetic effects. The third volume, Microwave and RF
    Design: Networks, covers microwave network theory which is the theory
    that describes power flow and can be used with transmission line effects.
    Topics covered in Microwave and RF Design: Modules, focus on designing
    microwave circuits and systems using modules introducing a large number
    of different modules. Modules is just another term for a network but the
    implication is that is is packaged and often available off-the-shelf. Other
    topics that are important in system design using modules are considered
    including noise, distortion, and dynamic range. Most microwave and RF
    designers construct systems using modules developed by other engineers
    who specialize in developing the modules. Examples are filter and amplifier
    modules which once designed can be used in many different systems. Much
    of microwave design is about maximizing dynamic range, minimizing noise,
    and minimizing DC power consumption. The fifth volume in this series,
    Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators, considers amplifier and
    oscillator design and develops the skills required to develop modules.

    Volume 1: Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems

    The first book of the series covers RF systems. It describes system concepts
    and provides comprehensive knowledge of RF and microwave systems.
    The emphasis is on understanding how systems are crafted from many
    different technologies and concepts. The reader gains valuable insight into
    how different technologies can be traded off in meeting system requirements.
    I do not believe this systems presentation is available anywhere else in such
    a compact form.

    Volume 2: Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines

    This book begins with a chapter on transmission line theory and introduces
    the concepts of forward- and backward-traveling waves. Many examples are
    included of advanced techniques for analyzing and designing transmission
    line networks. This is followed by a chapter on planar transmission lines
    with microstrip lines primarily used in design examples. Design examples
    illustrate some of the less quantifiable design decisions that must be made.
    The next chapter describes frequency-dependent transmission line effects
    and describes the design choices that must be taken to avoid multimoding.
    The final chapter in this volume addresses coupled-lines. It is shown how to
    design coupled-line networks that exploit this distributed effect to realize
    novel circuit functionality and how to design networks that minimize
    negative effects. The modern treatment of transmission lines in this volume
    emphasizes planar circuit design and the practical aspects of designing
PREFACE                                                                          vii

around unwanted effects. Detailed design of a directional coupler is used
to illustrate the use of coupled lines. Network equivalents of coupled lines
are introduced as fundamental building blocks that are used later in the
synthesis of coupled-line filters. The text, examples, and problems introduce
the often hidden design requirements of designing to mitigate parasitic
effects and unwanted modes of operation.

Volume 3: Microwave and RF Design: Networks

Volume 3 focuses on microwave networks with descriptions based on S
parameters and ABCD matrices, and the representation of reflection and
transmission information on polar plots called Smith charts. Microwave
measurement and calibration technology are examined. A sampling of
the wide variety of microwave elements based on transmission lines is
presented. It is shown how many of these have lumped-element equivalents
and how lumped elements and transmission lines can be combined as a
compromise between the high performance of transmission line structures
and the compactness of lumped elements. This volume concludes with an
in-depth treatment of matching for maximum power transfer. Both lumped-
element and distributed-element matching are presented.

Volume 4: Microwave and RF Design: Modules

Volume 4 focuses on the design of systems based on microwave modules.
The book considers the wide variety of RF modules including amplifiers,
local oscillators, switches, circulators, isolators, phase detectors, frequency
multipliers and dividers, phase-locked loops, and direct digital synthesizers.
The use of modules has become increasingly important in RF and microwave
engineering. A wide variety of passive and active modules are available
and high-performance systems can be realized cost effectively and with
stellar performance by using off-the-shelf modules interconnected using
planar transmission lines. Module vendors are encouraged by the market
to develop competitive modules that can be used in a wide variety of
applications. The great majority of RF and microwave engineers either
develop modules or use modules to realize RF systems. Systems must also
be concerned with noise and distortion, including distortion that originates
in supposedly linear elements. Something as simple as a termination
can produce distortion called passive intermodulation distortion. Design
techniques are presented for designing cascaded systems while managing
noise and distortion. Filters are also modules and general filter theory is
covered and the design of parallel coupled line filters is presented in detail.
Filter design is presented as a mixture of art and science. This mix, and the
thought processes involved, are emphasized through the design of a filter
integrated throughout this chapter.

Volume 5: Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators

The fifth volume presents the design of amplifiers and oscillators in
a way that enables state-of-the-art designs to be developed. Detailed
strategies for amplifiers and voltage-controlled oscillators are presented.
Design of competitive microwave amplifiers and oscillators are particularly
challenging as many trade-offs are required in design, and the design
decisions cannot be reduced to a formulaic flow. Very detailed case studies
are presented and while some may seem quite complicated, they parallel the
level of sophistication required to develop competitive designs.
viii  PREFACE

      Case Studies

      A key feature of this book series is the use of real world case studies
      of leading edge designs. Some of the case studies are designs done in
      my research group to demonstrate design techniques resulting in leading
      performance. The case studies and the persons responsible for helping to
      develop them are as follows.

         1. Software defined radio transmitter.
         2. High dynamic range down converter design. This case study was

             developed with Alan Victor.
         3. Design of a third-order Chebyshev combline filter. This case study was

             developed with Wael Fathelbab.
         4. Design of a bandstop filter. This case study was developed with Wael

             Fathelbab.
         5. Tunable Resonator with a varactor diode stack. This case study was

             developed with Alan Victor.
         6. Analysis of a 15 GHz Receiver. This case study was developed with

             Alan Victor.
         7. Transceiver Architecture. This case study was developed with Alan

             Victor.
         8. Narrowband linear amplifier design. This case study was developed

             with Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
         9. Wideband Amplifier Design. This case study was developed with Dane

             Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
        10. Distributed biasing of differential amplifiers. This case study was

             developed with Wael Fathelbab.
        11. Analysis of a distributed amplifier. This case study was developed with

             Ratan Bhatia, Jason Gerber, Tony Kwan, and Rowan Gilmore.
        12. Design of a WiMAX power amplifier. This case study was developed

             with Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
        13. Reflection oscillator. This case study was developed with Dane Collins

             and National Instruments Corporation.
        14. Design of a C-Band VCO. This case study was developed with Alan

             Victor.
        15. Oscillator phase noise analysis. This case study was developed with

             Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
         Many of these case studies are available as captioned YouTube videos and
      qualified instructors can request higher resolution videos from the author.

      Course Structures

      Based on the adoption of the first and second editions at universities,
      several different university courses have been developed using various parts
      of what was originally one very large book. The book supports teaching
      two or three classes with courses varying by the selection of volumes
      and chapters. A standard microwave class following the format of earlier
      microwave texts can be taught using the second and third volumes. Such
      a course will benefit from the strong practical design flavor and modern
      treatment of measurement technology, Smith charts, and matching networks.
      Transmission line propagation and design is presented in the context of
      microstrip technology providing an immediately useful skill. The subtleties
      of multimoding are also presented in the context of microstrip lines. In such
PREFACE                                                                            ix

a class the first volume on microwave systems can be assigned for self-
learning.

   Another approach is to teach a course that focuses on transmission line
effects including parallel coupled-line filters and module design. Such a class
would focus on Volumes 2, 3 and 4. A filter design course would focus
on using Volume 4 on module design. A course on amplifier and oscillator
design would use Volume 5. This course is supported by a large number of
case studies that present design concepts that would otherwise be difficult to
put into the flow of the textbook.

   Another option suited to an undergraduate or introductory graduate class
is to teach a class that enables engineers to develop RF and microwave
systems. This class uses portions of Volumes 2, 3 and 4. This class then omits
detailed filter, amplifier, and oscillator design.

   The fundamental philosophy behind the book series is that the broader
impact of the material should be presented first. Systems should be discussed
up front and not left as an afterthought for the final chapter of a textbook, the
last lecture of the semester, or the last course of a curriculum.

   The book series is written so that all electrical engineers can gain an
appreciation of RF and microwave hardware engineering. The body of the
text can be covered without strong reliance on this electromagnetic theory,
but it is there for those who desire it for teaching or reader review. The book
is rich with detailed information and also serves as a technical reference.

The Systems Engineer

Systems are developed beginning with fuzzy requirements for components
and subsystems. Just as system requirements provide impetus to develop
new base technologies, the development of new technologies provides new
capabilities that drive innovation and new systems. The new capabilities
may arise from developments made in support of other systems. Sometimes
serendipity leads to the new capabilities. Creating innovative microwave
and RF systems that address market needs or provide for new opportunities
is the most exciting challenge in RF design. The engineers who can
conceptualize and architect new RF systems are in great demand. This book
began as an effort to train RF systems engineers and as an RF systems
resource for practicing engineers. Many RF systems engineers began their
careers when systems were simple. Today, appreciating a system requires
higher levels of abstraction than in the past, but it also requires detailed
knowledge or the ability to access detailed knowledge and expertise. So what
makes a systems engineer? There is not a simple answer, but many partial
answers. We know that system engineers have great technical confidence and
broad appreciation for technologies. They are both broad in their knowledge
of a large swath of technologies and also deep in knowledge of a few
areas, sometimes called the "T" model. One book or course will not make
a systems engineer. It is clear that there must be a diverse set of experiences.
This book series fulfills the role of fostering both high-level abstraction of
RF engineering and also detailed design skills to realize effective RF and
microwave modules. My hope is that this book will provide the necessary
background for the next generation of RF systems engineers by stressing
system principles immediately, followed by core RF technologies. Core
technologies are thereby covered within the context of the systems in which
they are used.

1.1 Introduction to Microwave Modules

Most microwave design develops microwave systems using modules such
amplifiers, integrated circuits (ICs), filters, frequency multipliers, and
passive components. Economics necessitate that since modules are expensive
to design, e.g RF integrated circuits, that they be developed for multiple
applications. In system design modules are chosen for their dynamic
range, noise performance, DC power consumption, and cost. Foremost
the system designer must have knowledge of available modules and be
prepared to design a module itself if this results in competitive performance
and manages cost. Modules are interconnected by transmission lines, bias
settings and matching networks must be designed, and a system frequency
plan must be developed that trades-off cost and performance while avoiding
interference. All these topics are addressed on this book which develops the
knowledge of modules, and the skills required to design microwave systems.

   Most RF systems are composed of a cascade of modules each of which
is separately designed and characterized. They often have 50  input and
output impedances so that modules can be freely interconnected. Just as
often matching networks must be design by the user as otherwise operating
frequencies are pre-determined by the module vendor as a matching
network usually has a narrower bandwidth than that of the functional
core of the module. In high volume applications, several modules could be
monolithically integrated, but even then, design is based on the concept of
modules. Many modules are available "off the shelf" and high-performance
RF systems can be constructed using them.

   Examples of commercially available modules are shown in Figure 1-1.
They can range in complexity from the surface mount resistor of Figure 1-
1(a) and the transformer of Figure 1-1(d), up to the mixer and synthesizer
modules shown in Figures 1-1(b and c). Modules can have very good
performance as it is cost effective to put considerable design effort into a
module that can be used in many applications and thus design costs shared.

   1.2 A 15 GHz Receiver Subsystem

   An example of a microwave subsystem designed using modules is the
   15 GHz receiver subsystem shown in Figure 1-2 with details of the frequency
   conversion section shown in Figure 1-3. This receiver subsystem is itself
   a module used in building a complete transceiver system for a point-to-
   point microwave link connecting two basestations. The modules of the
   receiver include amplifiers, frequency multipliers, a mixers, an isolator, and a
   waveguide adaptor. These modules are available as off-the-shelf components
   from companies that specialize in developing them, and selling them to a
   large user base. This receiver is the subject of a case study in Section 7.6 where
   more details of the modules, frequency planning, and signal flow are given.

   1.3 Book Outline

   This book describes modules and tools required to design microwave
   systems using modules. A large number of modules are presented with
   the aim of building a 'module vocabulary.' An engineer must know what
   modules are available before a microwave system can be designed using
   modules.

      The first set of modules examined are filters in Chapter 2. These have
   the important task of only letting wanted signals through a circuit while
   blocking noise and unwanted signals. Then parallel coupled line (PCL) filters
   are considered in Chapter 3. A PCL filter is the most common type of
   microwave filter and is based on the inherent filtering properties of a pair
   of coupled transmission lines.

      Chapter 4 introduces metrics for noise, distortion, and dynamic range and
   introduces the tools that are required to design systems of cascaded modules
   that minimize noise and distortion, and maximize dynamic range.

      Chapter 5 develops knowledge of passive modules, particular ones that
   use diodes and switches. The final chapter, Chapter 6, considers mixer and
   source modules.

      This book is the fourth volume in a series on microwave and RF design.
   The first volume in the series addresses radio systems [2] mainly following
   the evolution of cellular radio. A central aspect of microwave engineering is
   distributed effects considered in the second volume of the series [3]. Here
   the transmission lines are treated as supporting forward- and backward-
   traveling voltage and current waves and these are related to electromagnetic
   effects. The third volume [4] covers microwave network theory which is
   the theory that describes power flow in microwave circuits and can be
   used to describe transmission line effects. Topics covered in this volume
   include scattering parameters, Smith charts, and matching networks that

   This appendix lists the symbols commonly used with RF and microwave circuits. Symbols
are from IEEE Standard 315-1975 [6]. Up until the 1970s IEEE was active in establishing
standard symbols for all electrical engineering fields and in particular circuit schematic
symbols to be used with microwave circuits. Since then vendors of microwave computer-aided
design tools have developed their own symbols but very often a vendor tends to adopt symbols
similar to those used by other vendors. However there are differences and as a result there
has not been a consensus to adopt a more modern standard for microwave symbols. What is
presented in this chapter follows the earlier IEEE standard where possible and for components
that are not in the standard, an attempt has been made to select symbols that are in common
use in technical papers.

2.1 Introduction

Filters are the most fundamental of signal processing circuits using energy
storage elements to obtain frequency-dependent characteristics. Some of
the important filter attributes are (1) controlling noise by not allowing
out-of-band noise to propagate in a circuit; (2) keeping signals outside
the transmit band, especially harmonics, from being transmitted; and (3)
presenting only signals in a specified band to active receive circuitry. At
microwave frequencies a filter can consist solely of lumped elements, solely
of distributed elements, or a mix of lumped and distributed elements. The
distributed realizations can be transmission line-based implementations of
12  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

    the components of lumped-element filter prototypes or, preferably, make
    use of the particular frequency characteristics found with certain distributed
    structures. Loss in lumped elements, particularly above a few gigahertz,
    means that the performance of distributed filters nearly always exceeds
    that of lumped-element filters. However, since the basic component of
    a distributed filter is a one-quarter wavelength long transmission line,
    distributed filters can be prohibitively large below a few gigahertz.

       Only a few basic types of responses are required of most RF filters as
    follows:

      (a) Lowpass--providing maximum power transfer at frequencies below
           the corner frequency, f0. Above f0, transmission is blocked. See Figure
           2-1(a).

      (b) Highpass--passing signals at frequencies above f0. Below f0, transmis-
           sion is blocked. See Figure 2-1(b).

      (c) Bandpass--passing signals at frequencies between lower and upper
           corner frequencies (defining the passband) and blocking transmission
           outside the band. This is the most common type of RF filter. See Figure
           2-1(c).

      (d) Bandstop (or notch)--which blocks signals between lower and upper
           corner frequencies (defining the stopband). See Figure 2-1(d).

      (e) Allpass--which equalizes a signal by adjusting the phase generally to
           correct for phase distortion elsewhere. See Figure 2-1(e).

    The above list is not comprehensive, as actual operating conditions may
    mandate specific frequency profiles. For example, WiFi systems operating at
    2.45 GHz are susceptible to potentially large signals being transmitted from
    nearby cellular phones operating in the 1700-2300 MHz range. Thus a front-
    end filter for a 2.45 GHz system must ensure very high levels of attenuation
    over the 1700-2300 MHz range. Thus the optimum solution here, probably,
    will have an asymmetrical frequency response with high rejection on one
    side of the passband obtained by accepting lower rejection on the other side.

    2.1.1 Filter Prototypes

    In the 1960s an approach to RF filter design and synthesis was developed
    and this is still followed. The approach is to translate the mathematical
    response of a lowpass filter. A filter with the desired lowpass response is
    then synthesized using lumped elements and the resulting filter is called a
    lowpass prototype. The lowpass filter is then transformed so that the new
    lumped-element filter has the desired RF response, such as highpass or
    bandpass. In the case of a bandpass filter, each inductor and capacitor of the
    lowpass prototype becomes a resonator that is coupled to another resonator.
    In distributed form, this basic resonator is a one-quarter wavelength long
    transmission line.

       Filter synthesis is a systematic approach to realizing circuits with desired
    frequency characteristics. A filter can also be thought of as a hardware
    implementation of a differential equation producing a specific impulse,

step, or frequency response. It is not surprising that a filter can be
described this way as the lumped reactive elements, L and C, describe first-
order differential equations and their interconnection describes higher-order
differential equations.

   The synthesis of a filter response begins by identifying the desired
differential equation response. The differential equations are specified using
the Laplace variable, s, so that in the frequency domain (with s = ) an nth-
order differential equation becomes an nth-order polynomial expression in
s. If possible, and this is usually the case, a lowpass version of a filter can be
developed. The conversion to the final filter shape, say a bandpass response,
proceeds mathematically through a number of stages. Each stage has a circuit
form and each stage is called a filter prototype.

2.1.2 Image Parameter Versus Insertion loss Methods

Filter networks can be synthesized using the image parameter method or
the reflection coefficient (or insertion loss) method [1]. The image parameter
measured is based on cascading two-port networks with each two-port
having the essential desired filter response [2]. Several of these two-ports are
cascaded to achieve a periodic-like structure that has the final desired filter
response. This method is restrictive and arbitrary filter responses can not be
obtained. It is rarely used in RF and microwave filter design but is useful in
analyzing simple structures with cascades of identical elements [3]. A better
approach is to use the insertion loss method as used in this chapter.

2.2 Singly and Doubly Terminated Networks

Filters are generally two-port networks and they provide maximum power
transfer from a source to a load over a specified frequency range while
rejecting the transmission of signals at other frequencies. Two possible filter
networks are shown in Figure 2-2. The network in Figure 2-2(a) is known
as a doubly terminated network, as both ports are resistively terminated.
14             STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

    (a) Doubly terminated network                  (b) Singly terminated network

               Figure 2-2: Terminated networks.

    The network in Figure 2-2(b) is called a singly terminated network, as only
    one port is terminated in a resistor. The doubly terminated network is
    much closer to the type of network required at RF where loads and source
    impedances are finite. A singly terminated network is applicable in some RF
    integrated circuit applications where very little RF power is involved and
    often when feedback is used. In such cases the output of an RFIC amplifier
    can approximate an ideal voltage source as the Thevenin equivalent source
    impedance can be negligible. Most synthesis of singly terminated filter
    networks uses an analogous procedure to that presented here for doubly
    terminated filters.

    2.2.1 Doubly Terminated Networks

    The established filter synthesis procedure for doubly terminated filter

    networks focuses on realizing the input reflection coefficient. For a lossless

    filter the square of the reflection coefficient magnitude is one minus the

    square of the insertion loss and this is the origin of this method being called

    the insertion loss method.

    The input reflection coefficient of the doubly terminated network in Figure

    2-2(a) is                      1 (s) = Zin,1(s) - RS ,
                                              Zin,1(s) + RS
                                                                                  (2.1)

    where the reference impedance is the source resistance, RS, and s is the
    Laplace variable. In the passband of a filter the reflection coefficient is
    approximately zero.

       There are several other parameters used in filter design and these will be
    introduced now. The transducer power ratio (TPR) is defined as

               TPR = Maximum power available from the source
                                   Power absorbed by the load

               12 (Vg (s)/2)2/RS 1                                      2
               = 12                             =                                 (2.2)
                                   2 V2 (s)/RL     2  RL Vg(s) .
                                                      RS V2(s)

    The transmission coefficient, T (s), of the network is

               T (s) =               1 =2             RS V2(s) ,                  (2.3)
                                   TPR(s)             RL Vg(s)

    IF the filter is lossless, the insertion loss (IL) (or transducer function) is
                                   IL(s) = TPR(s) = |1/T (s)|2 . (2.4)
FILTERS                                                                                          15

   The next step in development of the filter synthesis procedure is
introduction of the characteristic function, defined as the ratio of the
reflection and transmission coefficients:

                                  K (s) = 1 (s) = N (s) , (2.5)
                                              T (s) D (s)

where N is the numerator function and D is the denominator function. Ide-
ally the filter network is lossless and so, from the principle of energy conser-
vation, the sum of the magnitudes squared of the transmission and reflection
coefficients must be unity:

    |T (s)|2 + |1 (s)|2 = 1. (2.6) That is, |T (s)|2 = 1 - |1(s)|2 . (2.7)

Dividing both sides of Equation (2.7) by |T (s)|2 results in

    1 |1 (s)|2                    (2.8) or 1 = |IL(s)| - |K (s)|2 . (2.9)
1=       2-          2,
    |T (s)| |T (s)|

Rearranging Equation (2.9) leads to

                   |IL(s)| = 1 + |K (s)|2                                   (2.10)
                                                                            (2.12)
and so |T (s)|2 =    1            (2.11) and |1(s)|2 =        |K (s)|2
                                                                        2.
                               2
                   1 + |K (s)|                          1 + |K(s)|

   In the above it is seen that both the reflection and transmission coefficients
are functions of the characteristic function of the two-port network. A
milestone has been reached. In an RF filter, the frequency-dependent
insertion loss or transmission coefficient is of most importance, as these
are directly related to power flow. Equation (2.11) shows that this can be
expressed in terms of another function, K(s), which, from Equation (2.5),
can be expressed as the ratio of N (s) and D(s). For lumped-element circuits,
N (s) and D(s) are polynomials.

2.2.2 Lowpass Filter Response

As an example of the relationship of the various filter responses, consider the
lossless lowpass filter responses shown in Figure 2-3. This filter has a lowpass
response with a corner frequency expressed in radians as c = 1 rad/s.
Ideally T (s) for s   (note s = ) would be one, and for s > , T (s) would
be zero. It is not possible to realize such an ideal response, and the response
shown in Figure 2-3(a) is typical of what can be achieved. The reflection
coefficient is shown in Figure 2-3(b), with the characteristic function K(s)
shown in Figure 2-3(c). If |K(s)|2 is expressed as the ratio of two polynomials
(i.e, as N (s)/D(s)), then it can be seen from Figure 2-3(e and f) that the zeros
of the reflection coefficient, |1(s)|2, are also the zeros of N (s). Also, it is
observed that the zeros of the transmission coefficient are also the zeros of
D(s), as shown in Figure 2-3(a and c).

   The first objective in lumped-element filter design is development of the
transfer function of the network in the frequency domain or, equivalently, the
s domain.1 The input-output transfer function of the generic filter in Figure
2-4 is

1 Care is being taken in the use of terminology as s can be complex with some filter types, but
  these filters are realized using digital signal processing.

                        T (s) = Y (s)/X(s)                      (2.13)

and the design procedure is to match this response to a response defined by
the ratio of two polynomials:

                  N (s) amsm + am-1sm-1 + · · · + a1s + a0
         T (s) =        =n                                   .  (2.14)
                  D(s)      n-1
                        s + bn-1s + · · · + b1s + b0

Here N stands for numerator and D for denominator, and these are not the
same as those in Equation (2.5) (where they were just labels for numerator
and denominator). The filter response using a pole-zero description can
be synthesized so the design process begins by rewriting Equation (2.14)
explicitly in terms of zeros, zm, and poles, pn:

T (s) = N (s) = am(s + z1)(s + z2) · · · (s + zm-1)(s + zm) .   (2.15)
         D(s)     (s + p1)(s + p2) · · · (s + pn-1)(s + pn)

Since only the frequency response is of interest, s = , thus simplifying the
analysis for sinusoidal signals.

   The poles and zeros can be complex numbers and can be plotted on the
complex s plane. Conditions imposed by realizable circuits require that D(s)
be a Hurwitz polynomial,2 which ensures that its poles are located in the
left-half plane. N (s) determines the location of the transmission zeros of the
filter, and the order of N (s) cannot be more than the order of D(s). That is,
n  m so that the filter has finite or zero response at infinite frequency.

   Two strategies can be employed in deriving the filter response. The first is
to derive the polynomials N (s) and D(s) in Equation (2.14). This seems like
an open-ended problem, but it was discovered in the 1950s and 1960s that
in normal situations there are only a few types of useful responses that are
described by a few polynomials, including Butterworth, Bessel, Chebyshev,
and Cauer polynomials.

2.3 The Lowpass Filter Prototype

Most filter design is based on the synthesis of a lowpass filter equivalent
called a lowpass prototype. Transformations are then used to correct for the
actual source and load impedances, frequency range, and the desired filter
type, such as highpass or bandpass. An ideal lowpass response is shown in
Figure 2-5(a), which shows a transmission coefficient of 1 up to a normalized
frequency of 1 rad/sec. This type of response defines what is called a brick-
wall filter, which unfortunately cannot be physically realized. Instead, the
response is approximated and specified in terms of a response template (see
Figure 2-5(b)).

2 A Hurwitz polynomial is a polynomial whose coefficients are positive real numbers and whose
  zeros are located in the left-half of the complex s plane.

Figure 2-5: Lowpass  (a) Ideal brick-wall response       (b) Response template
filter response.

       The template specifies a passband response that is between 1 and 2 at
    frequencies below the corner radian frequency (at  = 1), and below 3
    above a radian frequency  > 1. The lowpass filter is harder to realize the

    closer the specified response is to the ideal response shown in Figure 2-5(a),

    that is, when

                                                                                                                      (2.16)

                     (2 - 1)  0, 3  0, and ( - 1)  0.

       Several polynomials have particularly interesting characteristics that
    match the requirements of the response template. At first it may seem
    surprising that polynomial functions could yield close to ideal filter
    responses. However, as will be seen, there is something special about
    these polynomials: they are natural solutions to extreme conditions. For
    example, the nth-order Butterworth polynomial has the special property
    that the first n derivatives at s = 0 are zero. The other polynomials
    also have extreme properties, and filters that are synthesized using them
    also have extreme properties. As well as the maximally flat property
    resulting from Butterworth polynomials, filter responses obtained using
    Chebyshev polynomials have the steepest skirts (i.e., fastest transitions from
    the frequency region where signals are passed to the region where they are
    blocked). Usually it is one of these extreme cases that is most desirable.

       A streamlining of the filter synthesis procedure is obtained by first
    focusing on the development of normalized lowpass filters having a 1 rad/s
    corner frequency and 1  reference impedance. Transformations transform
    a lowpass filter prototype into another filter having the response desired.
    These transformations give rise to symmetrical responses.

    2.4 The Maximally Flat (Butterworth) Lowpass
           Approximation

    Butterworth filters have a maximally flat response (Figure 2-6) that in the
    time domain corresponds to a critically damped system.

    2.4.1 Butterworth Filter Design

    Butterworth filters have the transfer function

                     T (s) =  N (s)  =n                  k       .                                                    (2.17)

                              D(s) s + bn-1s + · · · + b1s + b0

    This is an all-pole response. The characteristic polynomial of the Butterworth
    filter is

since s =  and where n is the order of the function. Thus the transmission
coefficient is

left in the form shown.
20                     STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

       Insight is gained by examining the characteristic polynomial for a real
    radian frequency,  (where s = ), at the following frequency points:

                       at  = 0  |T (0)|2 = 1 = 1                   (2.22)
                                                          1+0      (2.23)

                       at  = 1  |T (1)|2 = 1 = 1 .
                                                          1+1 2

    Thus the transmission response of the filter is at half power at the corner
    frequency  = 1. Another observation is that the transmission coefficient
    at  = 0 and  = 1 are independent of the degree of the characteristic
    polynomial. This is shown in Figure 2-6, where the responses of Butterworth
    filters are plotted for three different orders.

    2.4.2 Construction of the Transfer Function

    Often the characteristic function, K, is specified in terms of the variable ,

    and for synthesis purposes the response must be transformed back to the s

    domain. As an example, consider the maximally flat function of third order
    with a characteristic polynomial equal to 3 (from Equation (2.19)):

                       K() = 3 and |T ()|2 = 1 + 6 1 .             (2.24)

    (Note that here the first six derivatives of |K(s)|2 with respect to s are zero at
    s = 0.) So, from Equation (2.7),

                       |1 ()|2 = 1 -           1      6            (2.25)
                                                  6=      6.
                                      1+ 1+

    At real frequencies (i.e., frequencies lying on the imaginary axis in the s
    plane)

                         s = , so  = s/ = -s.                      (2.26)

    Thus, in the s domain, the reflection coefficient becomes

              |1 ()|2 = |1 ( (-s))|2 = |1 (s)|2 =     (-s)6        (2.27)
                                                               6.  (2.28)
                                                      1 + (-s)     (2.29)

                       2 -s6
    That is,  |1 (s)| =       6 = 1 (s) 1 (-s) .
                         1-s

    Factoring the denominator polynomial yields

              1 - s6 = (1 - s) (1 + s) s2 + s + 1 s2 - s + 1 .

    By choosing those factors with roots only in the left-half plane (required for
    a realizable network), the zeros of the denominator are obtained. Now the
    numerator of |1 (s)|2 is easily factored, and since this is third order, it only
    has three reflection zeros at DC. The resulting function is

              1 (s) =    s3                 ,                      (2.30)
                                                                   (2.31)
                       (s + 1) (s + s + 1)2

    and so    T (s) =    1                 .

                       (s + 1)(s + s + 1)2

    This example illustrates how 1(s) and T (s) can be obtained from K(s). This
    procedure is generalized in the next section.

2.4.3 nth-Order Reflection Approximation

Following the procedure outlined in the previous section, generalization
leads to the nth-order Butterworth response:

         |1(s)|2 = 1(s) · 1(-s)

         =        (-s2)n                        (-s2)n
                  2n=                                                          .      (2.32)
                  1 + (-s )            n                 2n          (s - sj)

                                            (s - si) .

                                       i=1               j=n+1

So |1(s)|2 has n roots (these are the sis) lying in the left-half s plane, and n
roots (the sjs) lying in the right-half s plane. Note that j is used as an index
and  (, without the dot) represents -1. It is reasonable to group all of the
left-half plane roots together (a circuit could not be synthesized if there were
a right-half plane root) so that

                  1(s) = n             (-s)n          .                               (2.33)

                                            (s - si)

                                       i=1

Solving for the roots of the denominator of Equation (2.32) (i.e., finding the
roots of 1 + -s2 n = 0) yields the following roots in the left-half s plane:

         si = exp  (2i - 1 + n)                 i = 1, 2, ..., n,                     (2.34)
                                        2n

where exp () = cos () +  sin ().

EXAMPLE 2.1 Reflection Coefficient Derivation for Butterworth Filter

Develop the reflection coefficient from the roots of the third-order (n = 3) Butterworth
lowpass filter prototype.

Solution: From Equation (2.34) the three roots are

                  s1 = exp              (2 × 1 - 1 + 3)              = exp  2                    (2.35)
                  s2 = exp                                   2×3                  3              (2.36)
                  s3 = exp                                                                       (2.37)
                                        (2 × 2 - 1 + 3)              = exp { }
                                                             2×3     = exp  4 

                                        (2 × 3 - 1 + 3)                           3
                                                             2×3

and the input reflection coefficient of the filter normalized to 1  is

         1 (s) =                          s3                         =            s3          .  (2.38)
                                       (s + 1)
                                                                        (s + 1) (s + s + 1)2

                  s + 12 -  3 2                 s + 12 +  3 2

This is the same as Equation (2.30).

2.4.4 Bandwidth Consideration

At the corner frequency of the Butterworth response, that is, at 1 rad/s, the
transmission response is 3 dB down from its maximum transfer response.

Figure 2-7: Chebyshev lowpass filter responses. In decibels, the ripple is RdB = -10 log[1/(1 +
2)] = 10 log(1 + 2),  is called the ripple factor.

    Sometimes microwave filters are designed to have 1 dB bandwidths. The
    radian frequencies at which the responses of various orders of Butterworth
    filters are 1 dB down are given in Table 2-2. By frequency scaling the
    Butterworth response the filter can be design for a specified 1 dB bandwidth.

    2.5 The Chebyshev Lowpass Approximation

    The maximally flat approximation to the ideal lowpass filter response is
    best near the origin but not so good near the band edge. Chebyshev filters
    have better responses near the band edge, with lower insertion loss near the
    edges, but at the cost of ripples in the passband. Example reflection and
    transmission responses are shown in Figure 2-7 for a seventh-order and a
    sixth-order Chebyshev lowpass filter.

    2.5.1 Chebyshev Filter Design                                                        (2.39)
                                                                                         (2.40)
    The general form of the Chebyshev transmission coefficient is
                                      |T (s)|2 = 1 + 2|K(s)|2 1 ,

    where  is the ripple factor and defines the passband ripple (PBR):
       PBR = 1 + 2, or in decibels RdB = PBR |dB = 10 log 1 + 2 .
FILTERS                                                                             23

The PBR can be seen in the transmission response, |T (s)|2, in Figure 2-7.
In the passband the peaks of the lossless filter response have |T (s)|2 = 1
and the minimums of the ripple response all have |T (s)|2 = 1/ 1 + 2 =
1/PBR. Consequently Chebyshev filters are also known as equiripple all-

pole lowpass filters. Also note that the corner radian frequency,  = 1 for the

lowpass filter prototype, has a transmission response (i.e., insertion loss IL)
of |T (s)|2 = 1/ 1 + 2 , whereas the Butterworth transmission response was

at half power at the corner frequency. For the Chebyshev filter, the insertion

loss at the corner frequency is the ripple:

                 IL = 1RdB = 10 log(1 + 2).                       (2.41)

   For the nth-order Chebyshev (lowpass filter) approximation, the square of
the characteristic function is

|Kn ()|2 =   cos2 n cos-1 () ,              -1    1 ,             (2.42)

             cosh2 n cosh-1(||) ,   -1,   1

which can be expressed as a polynomial. For example, with n = 3,  (2.43)
                               K3() = 43 - 3, for all .

(This equivalence was derived by Pafnuty Chebyshev.) It is surprising that
the trigonometric expression has such a simple polynomial equivalence.
From Equation (2.11) the transmission coefficient is (for -1    1)

             |T ()|2 = 1 + 2 cos2 [n cos-1 1 ()]                  (2.44)

and the reflection coefficient is

             |1()| =2              2 cos2 n cos-1()     .         (2.45)

                                      22    -1
                                   1 +  cos [n cos ()]

Factorizing the denominator of either Equation (2.44) or Equation (2.45)
yields the following roots (of the denominators of 1(s) and T (s)):

si = sin (2i - 1)  sinh 1 sinh-1 1
         2n         n                 

+  cos (2i - 1)  cosh 1 sinh-1 1                       i = 1, 2, . . . , n. (2.46)
             2n                    n      

The roots of the numerator of 1(s) in the s plane are

             sk =  cos (2k - 1)           k = 1, 2, . . . , n.    (2.47)
                               2n

Equations (2.46) and (2.47) can be used to obtain the reflection and
transmission coefficients directly in the s domain.

2.5.2 Chebyshev Approximation and Recursion

The characteristic function of the Chebyshev approximation can be obtained
from the recursion formula,

             Kn () = 2Kn-1 () - Kn-2 () ,                         (2.48)

                                                                                            (2.50)
             For example, with n = 3,

                          K3 () = 2K3-1 () - K3-2 ()
                                    = 2 22 - 1 -  = 43 - 2 -  = 43 - 3.

             2.5.3 Bandwidth Consideration

             At the corner frequency of the Chebyshev filter the transmission response is
             down by the amount of the ripple. This can be seen in Figure 2-7. However,
             the bandwidth of a filter is usually specified in terms of its 1 dB or 3 dB
             bandwidth at which the transmission response is down 1 dB or 3 dB,
             respectively, from its maximum response. The radian frequencies at which
             the responses of various orders of Chebyshev filters are 1 dB down and 3 dB
             down are given in Table 2-3. By frequency scaling the Chebyshev response,
             the filter can be designed for a specified 1 dB or 3 dB bandwidth.

             2.6 Element Extraction

             In the previous two sections the mathematical responses of Butterworth and
             Chebyshev filters were derived for various orders. In this section it will be
             shown how these filters can be implemented with inductors and capacitors
             using what is called ladder synthesis [4].

             2.6.1 Ladder Synthesis

             To obtain the element values yielding the desired transfer function, an
             impedance or admittance function must first be obtained. The impedance
             or admittance function can be readily obtained from the input reflection
             coefficient of a network, but for now the focus is on synthesizing a given
             impedance function. A general impedance function can be expressed as

                           Z(s) =  an    s2  +  2     s2  +  2    s2  +  2    ...
                                                                            2,              (2.51)
                                                  1            3           5

                                   bms (s + 2) (s + 4) (s + 6) ...

             where an and bm are constants. This can be realized using L and C elements
             in a network terminated by a resistor, provided that the degree of the
             numerator and denominator differ by no more than unity (i.e., |m-n|  1). In

Zrem, or admittance, Yrem, remains that can be similarly simplified. For ex-

ample, and referring to Figure 2-9(a), Z(s) = 1/(sC) + Zrem. So a pole of Z(s)

at DC requires the extraction of a series capacitor of value (see Figure 2-9(a))
                     C0 = 1 ,
                     sZ(s) s=0                          (2.52)

while a pole at infinity requires the extraction of a series inductor of value

(see Figure 2-9(c))  L = Z(s) .
                                s s=
                                                        (2.53)

Another possibility is a pole at a finite frequency (call this 0), which requires
the extraction of a series parallel LC block, as shown in Figure 2-9(e), with
26                       STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

             elements of value                                          and Li = 21 .                    (2.54)
                                                 s                                     0 .Ci

                                Ci = 2 2
                                        (s + 0) Z(s) s=o

             The extraction process can also be carried out on an admittance basis. First,

             Y (s) =     bms       s2  +   2    s2        +  2          s2  +  2    ...  .               (2.55)

                                             2                 4                 s

                                   2       22                           22     2
                         an (s + 1) (s + 3) (s + 5) . . .

             Now a pole at zero requires the extraction of a shunt inductor of value (see
             Figure 2-9(b))

                                      L0 = 1                                                             (2.56)

             and a pole at infinity requires the extraction of a shunt capacitor of value (see
             Figure 2-9(d))

                                   C = Y (s) .                                                           (2.57)

             A pole at a finite frequency requires the extraction of a shunt-series LC block

                Many aspects of filter synthesis can seem abstract when presented in full
             generality. Consequently it is common to illustrate filter synthesis concepts
             using examples. Following this time-honored tradition, an example is now
             presented.

EXAMPLE 2.2  Element Extraction for a Third-Order Lowpass Filter

    A third-order maximally flat filter has the reflection coefficient

             1(s) =                    s3                 .                                   (2.59)

                         (s + 1) (s + s + 1)2

    Synthesize this filter as a doubly terminated network.

    Solution:

    The reflection coefficient function (Equation (2.59)) has all its poles located at infinity, so the
    corresponding network realization must be made of simple L or C elements and terminated
    in a resistor. Hence, referring to Figure 2-2 and considering a 1  system,

                         1 + 1(s) 2s3 + 2s2 + 2s + 1
             Zin,1(s) =            =                                    .                     (2.60)
                         1 - 1(s)          22s + 2s + 1

    Note that the input impedance approaches infinity as the frequency goes to infinity, hence a
    series inductor must be extracted. The value of this inductor is

             L1 = Zin,1(s)                 = 1 H.                                             (2.61)
                         s
                                       s=
FILTERS                                                                                           27

The filter is developed by extracting one element at a time. Following the extraction of the
first element, the second-stage impedance is left. Now the impedance function is

         Zin,2(s) = Zin,1(s) - sL1 =         2s3 + 2s2 + 2s + 1      - sL1

                                                2s + 2s + 12

         =  2s3 + 2s2 + 2s + 1 - s 2s2 + 2s + 1                  =2       s+1          .

                              2s + 2s + 1 2                               2s + 2s + 1

Note that the stage impedance above, Zin,2, approaches zero as the frequency goes to infinity.
There is not a single series element that would cause this. However, the stage admittance
function,

                              Yin,2(s) =     1      =  2s2 + 2s + 1  ,                    (2.62)

                                          Zin,2(s)      s+1

goes to infinity as the frequency approaches infinity and so a shunt capacitor is extracted:

                              Yin,3(s) = Yin,2(s) - sC2 = 1 ,                             (2.63)
                                                                     s+1

where

                                             C2 = 2 F.                                    (2.64)

So sometimes it is more convenient to consider extraction of an admittance and sometimes it
is better to consider extraction of an impedance.

By examining the remaining stage impedance, it is seen that a pole exists at infinity, and so a
series inductor, L3, is extracted. The value of this inductor comes from

                              Zin,3 = 1 = s + 1                                           (2.65)
                                        Yin,3

and so the inductor value is

                              L3 = s + 1                = 1 H.                            (2.66)
                                             s S=

The final step is to extract a load of value 1 as follows:

                              Zin,4 = Zin,3 - sL3 = 1 .                                   (2.67)

This example synthesized a doubly terminated network. The resulting network, called a
ladder circuit, is shown in Figure 2-10. The left-most 1  resistor is part of the source.

This circuit has a dual form consisting of two shunt capacitors separated by a series inductor.
The dual circuit derives from realizing the admittance function obtained from the reflection
coefficient. Other network extraction techniques are presented in Scanlan and Levy [4, 5] and
Matthaei et al. [1].

                    2.6.2 Summary

                    The input impedance function of a lumped-element circuit can always be
                    expressed as the ratio of two polynomials in s and the order of the numerator
                    and the denominator polynomials can differ by at most one [5]. If the orders
                    differ by one, then a single inductor or capacitor can always be extracted,
                    however, the remaining impedance function may not be realizable. This
                    indicates that a more complex LC (and possibly R) combination is required.
                    To be able to systematically extract arbitrarily complex circuits, a long list of
                    possible functions, such as those shown in Figure 2-9, is required. For most of
                    the circuits of interest the LC combinations shown in Figure 2-9 are sufficient.
                    The next example describes impedance function extraction that requires an
                    LC combination.

EXAMPLE 2.3 Element Extraction of an Impedance Function

    Realize the impedance function Zw =  4s3 + 4s2 + 2s + 2      .

                                            4s + 2s + 12

    Solution:

    The order of the numerator is 1 greater than the order of the denominator and this indicates
    that a series inductor is perhaps present. The series inductance is

                                L1 = Zw(s)               = 1 H.                        (2.68)
                                            (s) z=

    The remaining impedance is

                    Zin,2 = Zw - sL1 =  4s3 + 4s2 + 2s + 2             2s2 + s + 2  .
                                                              -s= 2                    (2.69)
                                         4s + 2s + 12                  4s + 2s + 1

    The numerator and denominator of Zin,2 have the same order. Therefore a simple L or C
    element cannot be used to reduce the complexity of the impedance function. Thus an initial
    series inductor was not the right choice and the extraction must backtrack.

    Figure 2-9 shows several element combinations that can be used to reduce the complexity
    of an impedance function. Insight into which alternative to choose comes from factoring zw,
    and note that real roots are required, thus

                                4s3 + 4s2 + 2s + 2 (2s2 + 1)(2s + 2)
                         Zw =                        =                  .              (2.70)
                                4s + 2s + 12               4s + 2s + 12

    Examination of Figure 2-9 reveals that a ready fit to Zw is not found. Instead consider the

    admittance function

                                Yw = 1 =          4s2 + 2s + 1      .                  (2.71)

                                        Zw (2s + 1)(2s + 2)2

    So the reduction shown in Figure 2-9(f) looks like the right candidate. The general choice for

    the element is                       yx = bs2as+ 1 .

                                                                                       (2.72)

    Choosing b = 2 now reduces complexity (since part of the factored denominator of Yw now

    occurs), so               4s2 + 2s + 1           as
             Yw = 2s2as+ 1 +  (2s2 + 1)(2s + 2) - 2s2 + 1                              (2.73)

                    as        (4 - 2a)s2 + (2 - 2a)s + 1
               =2 +                                        .                           (2.74)
               2s + 1           (2s + 1)(2s + 2)2
FILTERS                                                                                          29

Choose a = 1,  Yw = 2s            2s2 + 1     = 2s + 1                               (2.75)
                        +2                                                           (2.76)
                      (2s + 1) (2s + 1)(2s + 2) 2s + 1 2s + 2                        (2.77)

                      = 2s2s+ 1 + Yin,2.

So C1L1 = b = 1, C1 = a = 1 F, L1 = 2 H, and

                      Yin,2 = 1           or Zin,2 = 1 = 2s + 2.
                        (2s + 2)              Yin,2

The final network is

2.7 Butterworth and Chebyshev Filters

The nth-order lowpass filters constructed from the Butterworth and
Chebyshev polynomials have the ladder circuit forms of Figure 2-11(a or b).
Figure 2-11 uses several shorthand notations commonly used with filters.
First, note that there are two prototype forms designated Type 1 and Type
2, and these are referred to as duals of each other. The two prototype forms
have identical responses with the same numerical element values g1, . . ., gn.
Consider the Type 1 prototype of Figure 2-11(a). The right-most element is
the resistive load, which is also known as the (n + 1)th element. The next
element to the left of this is either a shunt capacitor (of value gn) if n is even,
or a series inductor (of value gn) if n is odd. So for the Type 1 prototype,
the shunt capacitor next to the load does not exist if n is odd. The same
interpretation applies to the circuit in Figure 2-11(b).

              2.7.1 Butterworth Filter

              A generalization of the example of the previous section leads to a formula for

EXAMPLE 2.4 Fourth-Order Butterworth Lowpass Filter

    Derive the fourth-order Butterworth lowpass prototype of Type 1.
    Solution:
    From Equation (2.78),

                                g1 = 2 sin [/(2 · 4)] = 0.765369 H                               (2.79)
                                g2 = 2 sin [3/(2 · 4)] = 1.847759 F                              (2.80)
                                g3 = 2 sin [5/(2 · 4)] = 1.847759 H                              (2.81)
                                g4 = 2 sin [7/(2 · 4)] = 0.765369 F.                             (2.82)

    Thus the fourth-order Butterworth lowpass prototype circuit with a corner frequency of
    1 rad/s is as shown in Figure 2-12.

2.7.2 Chebyshev Filter

For a Chebyshev response, the element values of the lowpass prototype
shown in Figure 2-11 are found from the recursive formula [1, 6, 7]:

         g0 = 1      g1 = 2a1                                               (2.83)

         RdB = 10 log 1 + 2 ,

n is the order of the filter, and  is the ripple factor and defines the level of the
ripple in absolute terms. RdB is the ripple expressed in decibels (the ripple is
generally specified in decibels).

   An interesting point to note here is that the source resistor, the value of
which is given by g0, and terminating resistor, the value of which is given
by gn+1, are only equal for odd-order filters. For an even-order Chebyshev
filter the terminating resistor, gn+1, will be different and a function of the
filter ripple. Because it is generally desirable to have identical source and
load impedances, Chebyshev filters are nearly always restricted to odd order.
Thus the odd-order Chebyshev prototypes are as shown in Figure 2-13.

   Also, for an odd-degree function (n is odd) there is a perfect match at DC,

                                  |T (0)|2 = 1,                             (2.91)

    levels of ripple and odd orders up to ninth order are given in Table 2-5.

    2.7.3 Summary

    A Butterworth filter has a monotonic response without ripple, but a
    relatively slow transition from the passband to the stopband. A Chebyshev
    filter has a rapid transition but has ripple in either the stopband or passband.
    Butterworth and Chebyshev filters are special cases of elliptical filters,
    which are also called Cauer filters. In general, an elliptical filter has ripple in
    both the stopband and the passband. The level of the ripple can be selected
FILTERS                                                                            33

independently in each band. With zero ripple in the stopband, but ripple in
the passband, an elliptical filter becomes a Type I Chebyshev filter. With
zero ripple in the passband, but ripple in the stopband, an elliptical filter
becomes a Type II Chebyshev filter. With no ripple in either band the
elliptical filter becomes a Butterworth filter. With ripple in both the passband
and stopband, the transition between the passband and stopband can be
made more abrupt or alternatively the tolerance to component variations
increased.

   Another type of filter is the Bessel filter which has maximally flat group
delay in the passband, which means that the phase response has maximum
linearity across the passband. The Legendre filter (also known as the
optimum "L" filter) has a high transition rate from passband to stopband
for a given filter order, and also has a monotonic frequency response (i.e.,
without ripple). It is a compromise between the Butterworth filter, with
monotonic frequency response but slower transition and the Chebyshev
filter, which has a faster transition but ripples in the frequency response.

   More in-depth discussions of a large class of filters along with coefficient
tables and coefficient formulas are available in Matthaei et al. [1], Hunter [3],
Daniels [8], Lutovac et al. [9], and in most other books dedicated solely to
microwave filters.

2.8 Impedance and Admittance Inverters

Inverters are two-port networks used in many RF and microwave filters.
The input impedance of an inverter terminated in an impedance ZL is
1/ZL. Impedance and admittance inverters are the same network, with the
distinction being whether siemens or ohms are used to define them. An
inverter is sometimes called a unit element (UE). At frequencies of a few
hundred megahertz and below an inverter can be realized using operational
and transconductance amplifiers. At microwave frequencies the simplest
inverter is a one-quarter wavelength long line. In RF and microwave filter
design they are used to convert a series element into a shunt element. It
is much easier to realize shunt elements in distributed circuits than series
elements. Similar circuit transformations enable an inductor to be replaced
by a capacitor.

   The schematic representation of an impedance inverter is shown in Figure,
2-14(a). The constitutive property of the inverter is that the input impedance
of the terminated impedance inverter in Figure 2-14(b) is

                 K2                     (2.94)
         Zin = .

                 ZL

So the inverter both inverts the load impedance and scales it. Similarly, if
Port 1 is terminated in ZL the input impedance at Port 2 is Zin as defined
above.

   An impedance inverter has the value K (in ohms), and sometimes K
is called the characteristic impedance of the inverter. Sometimes K is just

       called the impedance of the inverter. For an admittance inverter J is used
       and is called the characteristic admittance of the inverter, and sometimes
       just the admittance of the inverter. They are related as J = 1/K. In Section
       2.4.6 of [10] it is shown that a /4 long line with a load has an input
       impedance that is the inverse of the load, normalized by the square of
       the characteristic impedance of the line. So an inverter can be realized at
       microwave frequencies using a one-quarter wavelength long transmission
       line (see Figure 2-15(b)). For the configuration shown in Figure 2-15(c),

       2.8.1 Properties of an Impedance Inverter

       An impedance inverter has the ABCD matrix

                                             T = 0 K /K 0 ,                       (2.96)

       where K is called the characteristic impedance of the inverter. With a load
       impedance, ZL (at Port 2), the input impedance (at Port 1) is (as expected)

       Z AZ in(s) = L + B = K = K2 .                                              (2.97)
                   CZL + D (/K) ZL ZL

       Now the ABCD matrix of the transmission line of Figure 2-15(b) is

                                             cos  Z0 sin  (/Z0) sin  cos  ,       (2.98)

       which is identical to Equation (2.96) when the electrical length is  = /2
       (i.e., when the line is /4 long). The inverter is shown in Figure 2-14(a) as
       a two-port and its implementation as a /4 long line is shown in Figure 2-
       14(c). The bandwidth over which the line realizes an impedance inverter is
       limited, however, as it is an ideal inverter only at the frequency at which it is
       /4 long.

       2.8.2 Replacement of a Series Inductor by a Shunt Capacitor

       A series inductor can be replaced by a shunt capacitor surrounded by a pair
       of inverters followed by a negative unity transformer (i.e., an inverter with
       K = 1). This equivalence is shown in Figure 2-16 and this will now be shown
       mathematically.
FILTERS                                                                       35

(a)                    (b)                                      (c)

a capacitor, inverters of characteristic impedance K, and a negative unity transformer; and (c)
an alternative realization. C = L/K2.

   From Table 2-1 of [11], the ABCD matrix of the series inductor shown in
Figure 2-16(a) (which has an impedance of sL) is

                       TL =  1 sL                               (2.99)
                             01

and the ABCD matrix of the shunt capacitor (which has an admittance of
sC) is, from Table 2-1 of of [11],

                       T1 = 1 0 sC 1 .                          (2.100)

The ABCD matrix of an inverter with K in ohms (generally the unit is
dropped and ohms is assumed) is

                     T2 = 0 K /K 0 ,                            (2.101)

and finally, the ABCD matrix of a negative unity transformer, n = -1, is,
from Table 2-1 of [11],

                       T3 = -1 0 0 -1 .                         (2.102)

Then the ABCD matrix of the cascade shown in Figure 2-16(b) is

     TC = T2T1T2T3

         = 0 K /K 0     10    0 K        -1 0
                       sC 1  /K 0         0 -1

         = 0 K /K 0     10      0 -K
                       sC 1  -/K 0

         = sCK K /K 0     0 -K
                       -/K 0

         = 1 sCK2 .                                             (2.103)
               01

Thus TC = TL if L = CK2 (compare Equations (2.99) and (2.103)). Thus a
series inductor can be replaced by a shunt capacitor with an inverter before
and after it and with a negative unity transformer. The unity transformer
36  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

port; (b) its realization using a shunt in-
ductor, inverters and negative unity trans- former' L = CK2. (a) (b)

                         may also be placed at the first port, as in Figure 2-16(c). Thus the two-ports
                         shown in Figure 2-16 are all electrically identical, with the limitation being
                         the frequency range over which the inverter can be realized. An interesting
                         and important observation is that as a result of the characteristic impedance
                         of the inverter (e.g., 50 ), a small shunt capacitor can be used to realize a
                         large series inductance value.

  EXAMPLE 2.5 Inductor Synthesis Using an Inverter

        Consider the network of Figure 2-16(c) with inverters having a characteristic impedance of
         50 . What value of inductance is realized using a 10 pF capacitor?

         Solution:
         K = 50, so L = CK2 = 10-11 · 2500 = 25 nH.

    2.8.3 Replacement of a Series Capacitor by a Shunt Inductor

    A series capacitor can be replaced by a shunt inductor plus inverters and a
    negative transformer (see Figure 2-17). The ABCD parameters of the series
    capacitor in Figure 2-17(a) are

                   T = 1 1/sC 0 1 ,         (2.104)

    and here it is shown that the cascade in Figure 2-17(b) has the same ABCD
    parameters. The cascade in Figure 2-17(b) has the ABCD parameters

    T = 0 K /K 0     10     0 K      -1 0
                   1/sL 1  /K 0       0 -1

    = 0 K /K 0       10       0 -K
                   1/sL 1  -/K 0

    = K/sL K /K 0     0 -K
                   -/K 0

    = 1 K2/sL .                             (2.105)
          01

    So the series capacitor, C, can be realized using a shunt inductor, L, inverters,
    and a negative unity transformer, and C = L/K2. It is unlikely that this

    transformation would be exploited, as much better lower-loss capacitors can

    be realized at RF than inductors.

    2.8.4 Ladder Prototype with Impedance Inverters

    The transformations discussed in the previous two sections can be used
    to advantage in simplifying filters. In this section the transformations are

applied to the prototype lowpass ladder filter shown in Figure 2-18(a).
The inductors in the ladder circuit are a particular problem as they have
considerable resistance at microwave frequencies. The series inductors can
be replaced by a circuit with capacitors, inverters, and transformers, as
shown in Figure 2-18(b). This simplifies further to the realization shown in
Figure 2-18(c), as the negative unity transformers only affect the phase of the
transmission coefficient. So a lowpass ladder filter can be realized using just
capacitors and inverters.

2.8.5 Lumped-Element Realization of an Inverter

The admittance inverter is functionally the same as the impedance inverter
(see Figure 2-14(a)) and the schematic is the same (see Figure 2-19(a)). As
will be shown, an inverter can be realized using frequency-invariant lossless
elements (i.e., elements whose reactance or susceptance do not vary with
frequency) using the network of Figure 2-19(b). Recall that J is used to
identify an admittance inverter and K identifies an impedance inverter.
If not specified by the context, the inverter (with value specified by a
number) defaults to being an impedance inverter. Alternatively units can
be used to indicate which type of inverter is being used. The function of

Figure 2-20: Impedance inverter: (a) as a two-port; and

(b) its lumped equivalent circuit (the element values in

(b) are impedances).                                                 (a)        (b)

             the inverter is the same in any case; both can be realized by one-quarter
             wavelength long lines, for example. For the remainder of this chapter it will
             be more convenient, most of the time, to use the admittance inverter, as many
             calculations will be in terms of admittances since most lumped elements in
             filters synthesis will be in shunt.

                Now it will be shown that the lumped-element network of Figure 2-19(b)
             realizes an inverter. To do this the inverter and the lumped-element network
             must have the same two-port parameters. First, the ABCD matrix of an
             inverter of characteristic admittance J is

                                                   TJ = 0 /J J 0 .                   (2.106)

                Referring to Table 2-1 of [11], the circuit of Figure 2-19(b) has the ABCD
             matrix

                      T = 1 0 -B 1                 1 1/(B)             10
                                                   01                -B 1

                      = 1 1/(B) -B 0 1 0 -B 1 = 0 -/B -B 0 ,                         (2.107)

             where B is the susceptance of the frequency-invariant elements. Equation
             (2.107) is identical to Equation (2.106) if B = -J. More practical equivalents
             of the circuit of Figure 2-19(b) can be derived, as shown later.

                For completeness, the lumped-element equivalent of the impedance
             inverter is shown in Figure 2-20 (derived from Figure 2-19 with J = 1/K).

EXAMPLE 2.6           Lumped Inverter Analysis

    Demonstrate that Figure 2-19(b) is a lumped-element admittance inverter.

    Solution:

    Terminating the network in Figure 2-19(b) results in the network shown in Figure 2-21(a).
    This is relabeled in Figure 2-21(b), where the elements are admittances. Then

                                          yin = y3//(y1$(y2 + yL)),             (2.108)

    where // indicates "in parallel with" and $ indicates "in series with." These are common
    shorthand notations in circuit calculations. Continuing on from Equation (2.108),

                      yin = y3 + 1 +          1    -1 = y3 + y2 + yL + y1 -1 .  (2.109)
                                      y1  y2 + yL                  y1(y2 + yL)

    Substituting y1 = B and y2 = y3 = -B, this becomes

                      y B(y in = -B + L - B) = -ByL + ByL + B2 = B2 .           (2.110)
                                          yL                yL             yL

    Thus the lumped-element circuit of Figure 2-19(b) is a lumped-element admittance inverter
    of value B (in siemens).

2.8.6 Narrowband Realization of an Inverter Using
         Transmission Line Stubs

In this section it will be shown that an impedance inverter can be
implemented using short- and open-circuited stubs. The match is good
over a narrow band centered at frequency f0. An impedance inverter is
shown in Figure 2-22(a) and its equivalent lumped-element network is
shown in Figure 2-22(b). A stub-based implementation is shown in Figure
2-22(c), where there are short- and open-circuited stubs of characteristic
impedance Z0. The input impedance of the stubs is shown at the inputs of
the stubs. The stubs have an electrical length  at f0 and the stubs are one-
quarter wavelength long (i.e., resonant) at what is called the commensurate
frequency, fr.

   Now it will be shown that the network of Figure 2-22(c) is a good
representation of the inverter at f0. This is done by matching ABCD
parameters. The ABCD parameter matrix of an inverter is

                          T = 0 K /K 0                (2.111)

and, at frequency f0, the ABCD parameter matrix of the stub circuit of
Figure 2-22(c) is

T = 1 0 -1/[Z0 tan ()] 1  1 Z0 tan ()         1       0

                          0     1             -1/[Z0 tan ()] 1

= 1 Z0 tan () -1/[Z0 tan ()] 0             1  0

                                   -1/[Z0 tan ()] 1

= 0 Z0 tan () /[Z0 tan ()] 0 .                        (2.112)

Thus, equating Equations (2.111) and (2.112), the stub network is a good
representation of the inverter if

                          K = Z0 tan () ,             (2.113)

and so the required characteristic impedance of each stub at frequency f0 is

              Z0 = K = K .                            (2.114)
                     tan () tan 2 fr  f0
40  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

    Special Case, fr = 2f0

    In most designs the stub resonant frequency, fr (also called the commen-
    surate frequency), is chosen to be twice that of the center frequency of the
    design, f0. So with fr = 2f0, then at f0

    Z0 = K                = K =K     (2.115)
           tan 2 2f0  f0     tan /4

    and the input impedance of the stub is K. So the characteristic impedance
    of the transmission line stub is Z0 = K.

    2.9 Filter Transformations

    So far the discussion has centered around lowpass filters. Filter design
    technology has developed so that the design of a corresponding lowpass
    filter is the essential first step, and this is used as a prototype to derive a
    filter with other characteristics. The three most important transformations
    are listed here:

       1. Impedance scaling: A lowpass filter prototype is referenced to a
           standard impedance. Usually 1  is used, so the reference source
           and load resistances are also 1 . To reference to a higher or lower
           impedance, scaling of the impedance of all elements of the filter is
           required.

       2. Corner frequency scaling: The corner frequency of a lowpass filter
           prototype is normalized to 1 rad/s. To reference to another frequency,
           the values of the elements must be altered so that they have the same
           impedance at the scaled frequency.

       3. Filter type transformation: These transformations enable the circuit of
           a lowpass filter to be converted to a circuit with a bandpass, bandstop,
           or highpass response. The concept is that the response at DC is to be
           replicated at infinite frequency for the highpass (so capacitors become
           inductors, etc.); to be replicated at the center of the passband for a
           bandpass filter (so capacitors become a shunt LC circuit); and to be
           inverted at the center of a bandstop filter (so capacitors become a series
           LC circuit).

    The transformations can be performed in any order. The key point is that
    the complexity of the lowpass circuit design is minimal since the number of
    elements does not grow until the filter type transformation is performed, so
    this step is often done last.

    2.9.1 Impedance Transformation

    The lowpass prototypes discussed up to now have been referred to a 1 
    system. The system impedance can be changed to any level by simply
    scaling the impedances of all the circuit elements in a filter by the same
    amount, as shown in Figure 2-23. The impedance transformation follows the
    same procedure for all filter types (the procedure is the same for lowpass,
    highpass, bandpass, and bandstop filters, for example). It should also be
    noted that impedance scaling of a transmission line is simply multiplication
    of the line's characteristic impedance by the scale factor.

EXAMPLE 2.7 Lowpass Filter Design

     Consider the lowpass filter, with an inverter, shown in Figure 2-24(a). This filter is
     referenced to 1 , as the source and load impedances are both 1 . Redesign the
     filter so that the same frequency response is obtained with 50  source and load
     impedances.

     Solution:

     It is necessary to impedance transform from 1  to 50 . The resulting filter is shown
     in Figure 2-24(b). Each element has an impedance (resistance or reactance) that is
     50 times larger than it had in the 1  prototype.

2.9.2 Frequency Transformation: Lowpass

Frequency transformations differ depending on the type of the filter. So it
is normal to frequency transform the lowpass prototype before converting
the prototype to another form (such as bandpass). The lowpass prototypes
normally have a band-edge or cutoff frequency at an angular frequency of
unity, that is, 1 rad/s. The band-edge frequency can be transformed from

they have the same impedance at the transformed frequency as they did at
the original frequency. The inverter is unchanged, as are the source and load
resistances, since these are frequency independent.

2.9.3 Lowpass to Highpass Transformation

The transformation of a lowpass filter prototype to a highpass filter is shown
diagrammatically in Figure 2-28. Mathematically  in the transfer function
of the lowpass prototype is replaced by -1/, that is

                          Thighpass() = Tlowpass(-1/).       (2.116)

In terms of a lumped element in the lowpass prototype circuit, if an
element has an impedance L and L is frequency independent, then the
corresponding element in the highpass prototype filter has an impedance
1/(2L). Thus reactive elements are transformed as shown in Figure 2-27(b),
where 0 is the corner frequency of both the lowpass and highpass prototype
circuits. So inductors are transformed into capacitors and capacitors into
inductors. For example, the odd-order lowpass filter prototypes shown in
Figure 2-13 are transformed into the highpass filters shown in Figure 2-29.

2.9.4 Lowpass to Bandpass Transformation

Understanding the transformation of the lowpass filter into its correspond-
ing bandpass form requires that the lowpass filter be considered with both
its positive and negative frequency responses, as shown in Figure 2-30(a).
This response is shifted in frequency to obtain the bandpass response shown
in Figure 2-30(b). Mathematically the radian frequency, , in the response

    and so the transfer function of the bandpass filter is derived from the transfer
    function of the bandpass filter with  replaced by (/0 - 0/). This
    separately maps the -1 and +1 band-edge radian frequencies of the lowpass
    response to the bandpass frequencies 1 and 2:

   As an example, a lumped-element Type 2 Cauer bandpass filter is shown
in Figure 2-31. The shunt LC combination and the series LC combinations
are resonators resonant at the center frequency of the filter. Here the
filter is normalized to Z0 source and load impedances. As these are the
same, this filter topology only applies for an odd-order filter. Combining
transformations, the element values of a lumped bandpass filter with center
radian frequency 0 = 2f0 and radian bandwidth BW = 2(f2 - f1) are as
follows (gr is from the lowpass prototype):

        gr          r = odd              BWZ0        r = odd
                    r = even                                     .

2.9.5 Lowpass to Bandstop Transformation

Again, consider both the positive and negative frequency responses of the
lowpass filter prototype, as shown in Figure 2-32(a). This response is shifted
in frequency to obtain the bandstop response shown in Figure 2-32(b). Math-
ematically the frequency, , in the response function is replaced by its band-
stop form:

That is,                     - 0 -1 .                               (2.123)
                                     0                              (2.124)
                                         1     0 -1

          Tbandstop() = Tlowpass  0 -  .

The center frequency (corresponding to DC in the lowpass prototype re-
sponse) is

                              o = 12                                (2.125)

    conversions are given in Figure 2-27(d).

       Combining transformations, the element values of a lumped bandstop
    filter with center radian frequency 0 = 2f0 and radian bandwidth BW =
    2(f2 - f1) are as follows:

       A lumped-element type II Cauer bandstop filter is shown in Figure 2-33.
    The parallel LC combination and the series LC combinations are resonators
    resonant at the center frequency of the filter. The parallel LC resonator
    is an open circuit at the center frequency of the stopband and the series
    LC resonators are short circuits. The LC resonators are implemented using
    resonators, usually transmission line segments and not lumped components.

    2.9.6 Transformed Ladder Prototypes

    Combining the filter type transformations, and with appropriate use of
    inverters, the original lowpass prototype ladder filter and its various filter
    type transforms are shown in Figure 2-34.

    2.10 Cascaded Line Realization of Filters

    In this section, filters are presented that use cascaded sections of transmission
    line, realizing series inductors and shunt capacitors. For example, a short
    (less than one-quarter wavelength long) length of relatively high-impedance
    line behaves predominantly as a series inductance. Also, a very short (much
    less than one-quarter wavelength long) length of relatively low-impedance
    line acts predominantly as a shunt capacitance. So a Pi network of lumped
    elements can be realized with alternate sections of low- and high-impedance
    microstrip lines. Such an inductive line is shown in Figure 2-35(a), which has
    the two equivalent circuits shown in Figure 2-35(b and c). Basic transmission
    line theory gives the input reactance of the line of length,  (with a low-
    impedance load),

                                      XL = Z0 sin (2/g) ,                         (2.128)

       Previously it was shown that a short length of line having a relatively
    low characteristic impedance yields a capacitive element and this is shown,
    together with its equivalent circuit, in Figure 2-36. The predominating shunt
    capacitance is determined by first considering the susceptance

    B = 1 sin 2                          (2.130) so that  = g sin-1 (CZ0) .  (2.131)

    Thus a cascade of low-impedance and high-impedance lines can realize
    (approximately) an LC ladder network.

       It is tempting to take filters synthesized in lumped-element form and
    realize them in the above manner with transmission lines. The series element
    realization concept presented in this section could be extended using shorted
    and open stubs to better realize shunt elements. The problem with this
    approach is that the resulting filters are narrowband and the response
    outside the desired operating range is unpredictable. It is far better to employ
    the Richards's transformation, considered in Section 2.12, which is a much
    broader bandwidth technique for realizing filters in distributed form.

    2.11 Butterworth and Chebyshev Bandpass Filters

    Designs of Butterworth and Chebyshev filters with center frequencies of
    1 GHz and 3 dB bandwidths of 10% are shown in Figure 2-37. Their
    transmission, S21, and reflection, S11, responses are shown in Figure 2-38.
    The filter skirts, i.e. the transitions from the passband to the stopbands, is
    steeper for the Chebyshev filter than for the Butterworth filter as expected.
    The ripple of the Chebyshev filter is very small and not seen in this plot. In a
    real filter there will be loss and low-level ripples in the magnitude response

disappear. However even with loss the steep skirts of the Chebyshev
transmission response remain. Also, even with loss, the impact of the
Chebyshev ripples is clearly seen in the reflection (S11) response. In Figure
2-38 three distinct S11 zeros are seen and these correspond to the three poles
of the Chebyshev filter's S21 response, but of course we cannot see these.
(In the Laplace transfer function there are 3 complex poles each pair being
transformed from one of the three poles of the lowpass prototype.) The
Butterworth filter also has three (complex) S11 zeros and these are all at the
center frequency of the bandpass filter, 1 GHz.

   Another characteristic that differs between the Chebyshev and Butter-
worth responses is seen in their phase responses plotted in Figure 2-39. Each
pole in the S21 characteristic causes a 90 phase change. The three complex
poles (i.e. six actual poles) of S21 then result in six 90 phase changes in S21
for a total phase change of 450. Small ripples are seen in the Chebyshev
phase responses in the pass band while the phase changes for the Butter-
worth filter are smooth. (The Chebyshev phase ripples remain even with
low-level loss.)

   The magnitude and phase responses, Figures 2-38 and 2-39, do not provide
complete visualization of the filter characteristics. Additional insight is
provided in the S11 loci on the Smith chart, see Figure 2-40. Figure 2-40 shows
the S11 characteristics plotted on Smith charts. (In the passband the S21 locus
would be very close to the unit circle and little of value is observed in the
passband.) There is a wealth of information here. First consider the response
for the Chebyshev filter, Figure 2-40(a). As frequency increases from 0.8 GHz,
the locus of S11 is first close to the unit circle and then approaches the origin

    of the polar plot as the frequency approaches the passband of the filter. A
    special characteristic of the Chebyshev response is the looping which here
    results in three passes of the locus through the origin. These are the three
    zeros. Eventually the locus of S11 increases as frequency increases above the
    passband. A loop is also seen in the Butterworth response, Figure 2-40(b).
    This loop goes through the origin and while it seems that there is just one
    zero there are actually three. What is happening is that as frequency increases
    and as the locus of the Butterworth S11 response approaches the origin, the
    movement of the locus with respect to frequency slows down. The best way
    to be convinced that there are three zeros of S11 is to look at the transmission
    phase ( S21) response in Figure 2-38.

       Comprehensive visualization of the filter response requires the rectangular
    plots of the magnitudes of S21 and S11, Figure 2-38, of S21 phase, Figure 2-
    39, and the Smith chart plot of S11, Figure 2-40. The phase plot convinces
    you of the number of zeros in your design which is important in interpreting
    the Butterworth results. A physical implementation of the design will not be
    exact and so tuning is required. Then the most important characterizations
    are the rectangular magnitude and Smith chart responses. Here the loops on
    the Smith chart, even if they do not go through the origin exactly, distinguish
    the Butterworth and Chebyshev responses. Matching may be required to
    shift the loops to the origin of the polar plot.

    2.12 Richards's Transformation

    Richards's transformation is a remarkable scheme that takes into account
    the actual properties of transmission lines, yielding broadband transmission
    line-based implementations of lumped-element filter prototypes [12-15].
FILTERS                                                                          51

2.12.1 Richards's Transformation and Transmission Lines

Consider a section of transmission line of electrical length  with ABCD pa-

rameters

          T = cos () Z0 sin () /Z0 sin () cos () .                     (2.132)

If this line is terminated in a load, ZL, then its input impedance is

          Zin() = cos()ZL + Z0 sin() .                                 (2.133)
                      j/Z0 sin()ZL + cos()

Now examine two extreme conditions. As the load impedance increases,
eventually becoming an open circuit, the input impedance of a line with
electrical length  is defined in terms of a cotangent of the electrical length:

          ZL                Zin() = Z0 cot()                           (2.134)
                                                                       (2.135)

                              Yin() = Y0 tan().

   As the load impedance reduces to become a short circuit, the input
impedance of a line with electrical length  is defined in terms of a tangent
of the electrical length:

          ZL  0  Zin() = Z0 tan().                                     (2.136)

   These results lead to the Richards's transformation, which replaces the
Laplace variable, s, by Richards's variable, S, where S =  tan(). This

transformation is written

                           s  S =  tan().                              (2.137)

For now  and  are constants that can be chosen as design variables. ,
of course, is the electrical length of the line. Also,  must have the units of
impedance and it is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line.

   Applying the Richards's transformation to a capacitor, the admittance of
the element is transformed as follows:

          y = sC  Y = SC = C tan(),                                    (2.138)

so that the capacitor is transformed into an open-circuited stub with
characteristic admittance

                           Y0 = C .                                    (2.139)

If a lumped-element capacitor with admittance y = sC is to be realized using
a transmission line, the admittance Y = SC = C tan() is instead realized.
There are two parameters to select to realize this admittance. The first, ,
is the characteristic admittance of the transmission line (and for any given
transmission line topology there is a minimum and maximum characteristic
admittance or impedance that can be realized), and  is the electrical length
of the line.

   Applying the transformation to an inductor, the impedance of the element
is transformed as follows:

          Z = sL  Z = SL = L tan(),                                    (2.140)

                                                                     fr = 2f0

                                                                     X = Z0
                                                                     fr = 2f0

    so that the inductor is transformed into a short-circuited stub with
    characteristic impedance

                                             Z0 = L.                 (2.141)

    Thus the Richards's transform converts an inductor into a short-circuited
    stub and a capacitor into an open-circuited stub.

    2.12.2 Richards's Transformation and Stubs

    There is a duality between stubs and inductors and capacitors; they are
    coupled by Richards's transformation. One of the important quantities used
    in the transformation is the commensurate frequency, fr, which most often
    is chosen as twice the operating frequency, f0. Considering stubs that are
    one-quarter wavelength long at fr, the duality is as shown in Figure 2-41.

    2.12.3 Richards's Transformation Applied to a Lowpass Filter

    In this section, Richards's transformation is used to realize a lumped-element
    filter in distributed form. The design example begins by considering a
    Chebyshev lowpass filter with the transmission characteristic

                        |T (s)|2 = 1 + 2 |K (s)|2 1 .                (2.142)

    With the Richards's transformation (s     tan ()) this becomes

                        |T ( tan )|2 = 1 + 2 |K ( tan ))|2 1 .       (2.143)

    Thus the passband edge at  = 1 is mapped to  = 1 as

Recalling that a capacitor is transformed into an open-circuited stub (see
Equation (2.139)), Richards's transformation applied to the lowpass filter
prototype results in a filter with transmission line elements only, as shown
Figure 2-42, provided that the inverters are realized using transmission lines.

   The implementation of a lowpass filter in distributed form results in
passbands and stopbands that repeat in frequency, as shown in Figure 2-43.
This occurs because transmission lines are used to realize lumped elements
and the two-port parameters of a transmission line repeat every wavelength
(or one-half wavelength in some cases). For example, the input impedance of
a stub is the same whether it is one-half wavelength long or one wavelength
long.

2.12.4 Richards's Transformation Applied to a Highpass Filter

With reference to Figure 2-44(a), the passband edge at  = 1 is mapped to 1,
as shown in Figure 2-44(b). This means that the passband at  = 1 is mapped

    The sequence of steps transforming a lumped lowpass prototype to its
    distributed highpass prototype are shown in Figure 2-45. As previously
    discussed, all the inverters can be approximated by transmission lines of
    length /2 at the corner frequency of the filter.

    2.13 Kuroda's and Norton's Network Identities

    Kuroda's and Norton's network identities are a number of pairs of
    equivalent networks that facilitate the transformation from one prototype
    to another, particularly transformations that enable realizable transmission
    line implementations.

    2.13.1 Kuroda's Identities

    Kuroda's identities embody a number of specific manipulations using
    impedance or admittance inverters. They are particularly useful in
    implementing Richards's transformations as they physically separate
    transmission line stubs, transform series stubs into shunt stubs, and can
    change characteristic impedances that are either too small or too high to
    practically realizable values. Kuroda's identities are a number of equivalent
    two-port networks, as shown in Figure 2-46. The proof is derived by
    obtaining the ABCD parameters of the two ports similar to the technique
    used throughout this chapter. The identities shown in Figure 2-46 are
    narrowband. With stubs replacing the lumped elements, Kuroda's identities
    then have broader bandwidths. Kuroda's identities with stubs are shown in
    Figure 2-47. The major use of these identities is to transform designs with
    series stubs (in addition to possible shunt stubs) into designs with shunt

         Here the inverters are impedance
         inverters and the designation
         refers to the impedance of the in-
         verter. Recall that an inverter of
         impedance Z1 can be realized by
         a one-quarter wavelength long
         transmission line of characteris-
         tic impedance Z1. (As usual, ele-
         ment impedances are indicated.)

   To see how these identities are used, consider the identity shown in Figure

2-46(a). The network on the left has a series inductor that, using transmission
lines, is realized by a series stub. A series stub cannot be realized in
most transmission line technologies, including microstrip. Using the identity
shown on the right in Figure 2-46(a), the series stub is replaced by the shunt

                         can be used. If the impedance of the inverter in the network on the left is too
                         low, then it can be scaled by a factor n2, where n2 = 1 + Z2/Z1.

                            One use of Kuroda's transforms is to convert a series inductor into a
                         shunt capacitor. Consider the inductor transformation shown in Figure 2-48.
                         Figure 2-48(a) shows that two inverters in cascade is electrically equivalent
                         to an inverting transformer. Since each inverter is a unity inverter (either
                         a 1  impedance inverter or a 1 S admittance inverter), the equivalence is
                         a unitary inverting transformer that corresponds to a 180 phase change.
                         So the transformation of a series inductor begins with the transformation
                         of the inductor (with value x) in Figure 2-48(b) into the network of Figure
                         2-48(c) in which the inverter cascade and the inverting transformer cancel
                         each other out. Using the Kuroda identity in Figure 2-47(a), the network
                         in Figure 2-48(c) converts to the electrically identical network in Figure 2-
                         48(d). Since the 180 rotation usually does not matter in circuits, the final
                         transformation shown in Figure 2-48(e) is usually acceptable. (The rotation
                         would only matter if there was another path between the input and output
                         as then phasing would affect the way signals on multiple paths combined.)
                         Now the capacitor in Figure 2-48(e) has the numerical value x, the same as
                         the numerical value of the original inductor. This is a result of using unitary
                         inverters. The key result here is that a series inductor is equivalent to a shunt
                         capacitor flanked by two inverters.

                     2.13.2 Norton's Identities

                         Norton's transformations enable the magnitude of lumped element values
                         to be scaled [16, 17]. Norton's transformations are shown in Figure 2-49
                         where K is the scaling factor. Additional elements are introduced in these
                         transformations including possibly negatively valued elements. Generally
                         these elements can be combined with other elements so that the elements
                         to be realized are positive (e.g. positive capacitor) and the transformer can
                         also be replaced through subsequent transformations using, for example,
                         Kuroda's identities.

2.14 Inter-resonator Coupled Bandpass Filters

The synthesis method that has been described so far leads to bandpass filters
that are a cascade of coupled bandpass resonators. A bandpass filter then
comprises pairs of resonators of the type shown in Figure 2-50(a) that are
coupled using what is called inter-resonator coupling (see Figure 2-50(b)). A
generalization of this architecture is that a bandpass filter comprises coupled
resonators that do not need to be in a linear cascade. Coupling the output of
one resonator latter in a cascade to the input of an earlier resonator is called
cross coupling, and a filter that uses this arrangement is said to be a cross-
coupled resonator filter or a cross-coupled filter. By reusing resonators in this
way, fewer resonators are required to achieve a specified bandpass response
and the filter can have higher performance or be smaller. An example of the
electrical design of a cross-coupled filter is shown in Figure 2-51.

   Design of a cross-coupled bandpass filter is not as systematic as the
design of a ladder filter. The design concept is based on using a number
of resonators where each resonator on its own has the same resonant

center frequency f0 = 1 GHz. Thus the stubs are /8 long at
f0.

                         frequency f0, where f0 is the center frequency of the filter. The desired
                         filter characteristics are obtained by adjusting the inter-resonator coupling,
                         that is, the coupling between pairs of resonators. Design is not a synthesis
                         process based on a series of mathematical transformations, but instead is
                         based on the understanding of the impact of changing the coupling. The
                         design process will now be described for a pair of resonators.

                         Coupling of a Pair of Resonators

                         A segment of a bandpass filter fundamentally comprises a pair of coupled
                         bandpass resonators. This is based on the lowpass prototype with a pair
                         of capacitors separated by an admittance inverter (see Figure 2-52). In
                         transforming this to a bandpass filter with a center frequency of f0, each
                         capacitor is replaced by a resonator such as that shown in Figure 2-50(a).
                         This leads to a pair of resonators, each resonant at f0, that are coupled by an
                         inverter (see Figure 2-50(b)). The value of the inverter determines the level
                         of coupling of the resonators.

                            Consider the circuit in Figure 2-53, which consists of a pair of coupled
                         resonators, with each resonator resonant at f0 = 1 GHz, and the resonators
                         are coupled by the series stub with characteristic impedance Z012 (i.e., the
                         Z012 stub). The circuit of Figure 2-53 is a segment of a Chebyshev 1 GHz
                         bandpass filter with a fractional bandwidth of 10%. This is an interim stage
                         of a bandpass filter design3 and the system impedance of this circuit segment
                         is 139.4 . The magnitude and phase of the 139.4- S21 and S11 parameters
                         of this circuit are shown in Figure 2-54(a), and the phase of S21 is shown
                         in Figure 2-54(b). Specific features to identify here are the two peaks in
                         the phase response at f1 and f2. These are also the frequencies of peak
                         transmission response where |S21| = 1. The bandwidth defined by f1 and
                         f2 is called the coupling bandwidth (= f2 - f1) or the bandwidth of the
                         filter (note that this is not the 3-dB bandwidth of the filter). The level of
                         coupling determines the coupling bandwidth. That is, changing the level of
                         coupling provided by the Z012 stub changes the position of f1 and f2. An
                         interpretation of what is happening is that by coupling the two resonators,
                         the resonate frequency of the resonators on their own, f0, has been split by
                         the coupling, resulting in two peaks at f1 and f2. The higher the coupling, the
                         larger the coupling bandwidth, and the lower the coupling, the smaller the
                         coupling bandwidth. For example, a narrowband bandpass filter comprises

                                3 Specifically these resonators are the left-most resonators in a design developed in Chapter 3

                           (see Figure 3-31).

resonators that have low-level coupling.
   So following the choice of an appropriate architecture, that is, the

number of resonators and the coupling arrangement, design and manual
optimization becomes one of changing the level of coupling between pairs
of resonators. Design is not as clean as for ladder filters, but the advantages
of a design with fewer resonators is a compelling justification. Invariably,
extensive (perhaps a day's worth) manual adjustment of the coupling of the
final fabricated filter is required. Overall this is an approach worth adopting
for high-value filters such as those used in a basestation, where the high unit
costs resulting from manual tuning of individual filters can be justified. This
type of filter design is considered further in [3, 18-21].

Relationship of Ladder Synthesis and Inter-resonator Coupling

The relationship of design focused on interresonator coupling and design
based on the ladder synthesis approach can be demonstrated for a pair of
resonators as follows. Consider the lowpass prototype circuit of Figure 2-52.
The input impedance of this circuit is

                                        2            -1
         Zin(s) = sC1 + J12/(sC2) .                            (2.148)

With s = , the poles of Zin occur when

           2  -  2C1C2                        =  0,            (2.149)

         J12

thus the radian frequencies of the poles are

          = ± J12 .                                            (2.150)
                    C1C2
60                STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

    Applying the bandpass transformation (so that the capacitors are replaced
    by the resonators of Figure 2-50(a)) results in the bandpass circuit of Figure
    2-50(b). With this transformation the frequency is transformed as

                      - 0 .                                          (2.151)
                             0 

    That is, the transmission coefficient of the bandpass filter is

                  TBPF() = TLPF   - 0 ,                              (2.152)
                                              0 

    where TLPF() is the transmission coefficient of the lowpass filter at the
    radian frequency . The poles of the bandpass filter are at 1, where

                   1 - 0 = + J12 ,                                   (2.153)
                  0 1                     C1C2                       (2.154)

    and 2, where   2 - 0 = - J12 .
                  o 2                     C1C2

    Then the coupling bandwidth of the filter is

                  f1 - f2 = 1 - 2 =               J12 0              (2.155)
                                       2           .
                                          2 C1C2

    Thus the coupling bandwidth can be directly related to the steps in the
    ladder-based synthesis of a bandpass ladder filter.

    Group Delay

    Group delay of a network, and in particular of a filter, is the delay to send
    information through a network. It is the time required for a modulated
    carrier signal to appear at the output of a filter after being applied to the
    input of the filter. Phase delay is a similar measure of delay but does not
    describe the time it takes to send information. It describes the delay to send
    a particular phase of a single sinewave. Group delay is a steady-sate concept
    and so only approximately captures the transient response of a filter.

       If a two-port has the transmission coefficient

                  T (s) = S21 = a + b = t ,                          (2.156)

    where a and b are its real and imaginary parts, t is its magnitude, and  is its
    phase. With s = , the phase of T is

                   () = tan-1 b .                                    (2.157)
                                       a

    The group delay, D, is the negative of the derivative of this phase as follows:

    Group delay = g() = - d = - d tan-1 b .                          (2.158)
                                       d d               a

    This compares to the phase delay:

                  Phase delay = () = -  = -tan-1 b .                 (2.159)

                                     resonator with the top gap capacitors. The input and output gap
                                     capacitors provide impedance matching.

   Figure 2-55(c) shows the group delay response of one of the resonators in
Figure 2-53, where the group delay peaks at the resonant frequency of the
resonator f0. The peak of the group delay occurs at the resonant frequency
of the resonator without loading. From examination of the phase of S21 (see
Figure 2-54(b)), it is clear that the group delay peaks very close to f1 and f2.
So the coupled resonator pair has two peaks in the group delay. This can be
seen in Figure 2-56, which plots the group delay of a single resonator and a
coupled pair of resonators.

2.15 Bandpass Filter Topologies

The essential structure of a bandpass filter comprises resonators that are
coupled to each other. A large number of filter architectures based on this
concept have been deployed. A parallel coupled line (PCL) filter called
a combline filter is shown in Figure 2-57. Here the microstrip lines form
the resonator and the coupling of parallel lines provides the interresonator
coupling. A variation on a filter with PCL resonators is shown in Figure 2-
58 [22]. This filter uses edge-coupled microstrip resonators that are /2 long
(at the center frequency). Figure 2-59 shows another distributed bandpass
filter topology utilizing end-coupled microstrip resonators. That is, the gaps
provide the interresonator coupling. All transmission line bandpass filters
have spurious passbands [23-25]. The root cause of the spurious responses
derives from the transformation of the parallel LC resonators into their

    transmission line form.
       A dielectric-resonator-based bandpass filter is shown in Figure 2-60 [26].

    Here the pucks are the bandpass resonators and they are coupled and the
    evanescent fields outside the pucks provide the interresonator coupling. The
    pucks shown are cylinders of high-permittivity material (typically having a
    relative permittivity of 500-85 000) with an approximate magnetic wall at the
    cylindrical surface of the puck. Thus the puck resonates when its diameter is
    approximately /2.4

       With all these filters the interresonator coupling functions as an inverter.
    Thus the basic functional unit of the bandpass filters is the coupled resonator
    structure shown in Figure 2-50(b).

    2.16 Case Study: Design of a Bandstop Filter

    The design of a bandstop filter begins with the lowpass filter prototype
    shown in Figure 2-61. To the lowpass prototype, the highpass transformation
    is applied to obtain the highpass prototype of Figure 2-62. Picking a center
    frequency of approximately 1 GHz and corner frequencies of f1 = 950 MHz
    and f2 = 1050 MHz, corresponding to a bandwidth of approximately 10%,
    the bandstop transformation is now applied. This results in the prototype
    of Figure 2-63. Finally, scaling the system impedance to 50  leads to the
    prototype of Figure 2-64. The impedance inverters must remain set at 50 
    in order to obtain a broad match. In the passband, energy will pass at all

    4 A better estimate is developed from the zeros of Bessel functions, as the fields inside the pucks
      have a Bessel function dependence (this is the form of the solution of the wave equation in
      cylindrical coordinates).

   In Figure 2-64, the inductor values are relatively large and the capacitor

values are relatively small so that it will be difficult to realize the filter in
either lumped or distributed forms. These values must be scaled to obtain
realizable values. One possible transformation is shown in Figure 2-65. To
establish that the left-hand and right-hand networks are equivalent, at least
near one frequency, the impedances and derivatives must be matched. For

       At this stage the bandpass resonators are then equated to short-circuited

    stubs by equating the admittance, Y1, of the lumped circuit in Figure 2-67(a)

    The characteristic impedance of the stub, Z0, is selected so that the frequency,
    r, is not too far above the upper band-edge frequency of the filter, in this
    case 1.05 GHz. Choosing Z0 = 20  results in the stub transformations
    shown in Figure 2-68(a-d). The bandstop filter prototype with stubs is shown
    in Figure 2-68(e). The final physical layout of the bandstop filter is shown
    in Figure 2-69. The response of the final bandstop filter design is shown in
    Figure 2-70.

    2.17 Active Filters

    With active circuits, losses in lumped-element components can be compen-
    sated for by the gain of active devices resulting in filters with high Q. Invert-
    ers can also be realized efficiently. The net result is that active filters provide
    a performance per unit area advantage over passive element realizations. Of
    course, active filters are limited to low-level signals (such as in the receive
    circuitry, and prior to the power amplifier stages) as the full power of the

signal must be handled by the active devices in the active filter. With active
devices, additional noise is introduced and so the noise figure of an active
filter must be considered at RF where bandwidths are significant.

   At microwave frequencies active filters based on traditional low-frequency
concepts have relatively low Q. Higher Q and narrower-band applications
require active inductors or distributed techniques. The smallest active filters
are the ones that use active inductors and the largest use distributed
transmission line elements.
66  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

       Sometimes the main role of a filter is to limit the dynamic range of signals
    presented to active circuits, thereby limiting distortion. Clearly active filters
    are not suitable when large out-of-band signals are a concern.

    2.17.1 Radio Frequency Active Filters

    There are several problems with lumped-element filters. High-order filters
    require many poles and zeros that must be precisely placed, requiring small
    tolerances. With active filters it is possible, to some degree, to achieve
    higher-order filters with fewer reactive elements and so the tolerancing
    problem is considerably reduced. Also, there are a few designs that can be
    tuned electronically. Lumped-element bandpass filters and highpass filters
    require inductors. Inductors are a major problem, as RF inductors are lossy
    and also only relatively small values can be obtained. On-chip inductors
    take considerable area and can thereby dominate the cost of RFICs. With
    active filters, feedback and capacitors can be used to realize inductor-like
    characteristics, defined as a positive imaginary impedance increasing with
    frequency at least over a small frequency range. Many times, and especially
    at lower radio frequencies, lumped inductors are no longer required. The
    size of capacitors in filters is another issue, and using feedback and gain, the
    effective value of capacitors can be magnified. All this comes with limits. The
    principle limit is that the cutoff frequency of the transistors must be much
    higher than the operating frequency of the filters. This is a cost incurred
    whenever feedback is used. A rough rule of thumb is that the transistor cutoff
    frequency should be about 10 times the operating frequency. So for a 5 GHz
    bandpass filter, a 50 GHz transistor process is required. The other significant
    cost is that active filters are only suitable for small signals. The efficiency, a
    measure of the amount of DC power used in producing the RF output signal,
    is then not a consideration. Active filters cannot be used where signal levels
    are likely to be large (such as at the output of a power amplifier or at the
    receiver input, due to likely out-of-band signals).

       The essential aspect of low-RF active filters is the use of feedback, with
    reactive feedback elements, to realize a frequency-domain transfer function
    with poles and zeros. The aim is not to synthesize effective capacitors and
    inductors, but to focus on the overall response. Active filters are generally
    developed as stages, with each stage realizing a second- or higher-order
    transfer function. Design is simulation driven, as this is the only way to
    account for the active device parasitics.

       In operational amplifier design, feedback is used to achieve gain stability,
    but at the cost of reduced bandwidth. If reactive feedback elements are
    used, high-order transfer functions can be obtained with just a few reactive
    elements. In Figure 2-71, a twin-T notch network is connected in the
    operational amplifier feedback path to obtain a bandpass filter [27]. Away
    from the notch frequency the feedback path has a high impedance and
    the overall amplifier gain falls off. As the signal frequency approaches the
    notch frequency, the feedback path becomes effective and the amplifier gain
    increases. The notch frequency, fn, is proportional to the RC product of the
    feedback components and the Q is proportional to the amplifier gain. The
    governing equations for this filter are

    fn = 1/(2RC) and Q = (1 + G)/4.  (2.165)

2.17.2 Biquadratic Filters

Biquadratic filters are an important class of filters and are the basic building
block used in analog and RF active filters. Biquad filters commonly use
operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs), the schematic of which
is shown in Figure 2-72(a). Here IO = GM VIN, which is also the basic
characteristic of an individual transistor. These circuits have characteristics
typical of operational amplifiers, including gain stability and resistance to
component tolerance variations. OTA-based filters have the advantage of
easy tunability, with pole and zero frequencies electronically adjustable. An
RF bandpass biquad filter is shown in Figure 2-72(b). Stages such as this are
cascaded to realize high-order filters.

   Biquadratic filters implement the transfer function

H(s) =   VOUT N (s) a2s2 + a1s + a0 a2(s + z1)(s + z2)         .
               =  =2            =                                 (2.166)
         VIN D(s) s + b1s + b0     (s + p1)(s + p2)

This is referred to as a biquadratic function and filters that implement this
function are called biquadratic filters or simply biquad filters. There are
several special types of biquad filters.

   The form of the biquadratic function for a second-order lowpass filter is

         HLP(s) = 2  a0     =2     K p2                    2.     (2.167)

                  s + b1s + b0 s + (p/Qp)s + p

HLP(s) has a double zero at s =  and thus negligible response at very high
frequencies.

   The highpass form of the biquadratic filter is described by

         HHP(s) = 2  a2s2   =2     K s2                    2.     (2.168)

                  s + b1s + b0 s + (p/Qp)s + p

filter. After [30].

    The response of HHP(s) at high frequencies is K and the response at very
    low frequencies goes to zero.

       The bandpass form of the biquadratic filter is described by

                     HBP(s) = 2 a1s         = 2 2 K(p/Qp)s .    (2.169)
                     s + b1s + b0 s + (p/Qp)s + p

    The response of HBP(s) at high and low frequencies goes to zero, and only
    at and near the center frequency,  = p, is there a reasonable response.

       The band-reject or notch form of the biquadratic filter is described by

                     HBR(s) = 2  a2s2 + a0  =2  K(s2 + z2)  2.  (2.170)

                     s + b1s + b0 s + (p/Qp)s + p

    The response of HBR(s) at high and low frequencies is high, but there is a
    double zero at the notch frequency,  = z, where the response is very low.

       With all of the biquadratic filters, the sharpness of the response is
    determined by Qp. The edge frequency or center frequency is p for the
    bandpass, lowpass, and highpass filters, and the notch frequency is z for
    the bandstop filter.

    2.17.3 Distributed Active Filters

    At high microwave frequencies, good results can be obtained by combining
    distributed elements with a gain stage. Commonly the active devices are
    used as coupling devices. A negative resistance can be produced using
    the active devices that can compensate for the losses associated with the
    transmission line elements or lumped passive elements in the filter. The
    concept uses a resonant tank circuit formed by a transmission line or
    lumped-element resonator with a negative resistance coupled into the tank
    circuit by the active devices [28-30]. This concept is illustrated in Figure
    2-73. Here a one-half wavelength long resonator forms a resonant circuit
    (commonly called a tank circuit in this context). A negative resistance is
    coupled into the tank circuit to compensate for losses in the resonator and
    the result is effectively a lossless tank circuit.

       An active resonator circuit is shown in Figure 2-74. The design of the
    lossless resonator is based on the negative resistance obtained when the
    capacitor is connected at the source of the MESFET. This element in the
FILTERS                                                                           69

source provides a feedback path between the output of the circuit, the
drain-to-ground voltage, and the input gate-to-source voltage. An increase
in the drain-source current leads to a voltage at the source that changes
the gate-source voltage. This induces a negative resistance that is adjusted
through the feedback capacitance, CF B, to compensate for inductor losses.
An additional inductor, LP , is added at the gate. The inductor resonates with
the series combination of CF B and CGS . CF B can be implemented using a
varactor diode to enable electronic tuning.

2.18 Transient Response of a Bandpass Filter

A bandpass filter is normally characterized by its center frequency and
bandwidth, and sinusoidal signals that are within the bandwidth are
transmitted by the filter and those outside the passband are reflected by
the filter. However, if the signal changes frequency quickly, the transient
response of the filter can be unexpected [32, 33].

   Figure 2-75 is a fifth-order filter with each pair of shunt resonators coupled
by a series resonator. In response to an RF pulse (a pulse of sinusoidally
varying RF), the filter passes energy in-band when all of the resonators have
reached steady state. When the RF pulse is removed, the resonators will loose
energy and eventually the RF signals on the resonators disappear. There will
be a finite time to "charge" and "discharge" the filter's resonators.

   A classic test of the RF response over frequency is to use a linear RF chirp,
as shown in Figure 2-76. With a linear chirp, the frequency of the signal
in the pulse changes linearly and smoothly over time from one frequency
to another. Figure 2-77(a) presents the transient response at the output of
70                           STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

1050 MHz: (a) chirp rate = 20 MHz/µs, (b) chirp rate = 400 MHz/µs. At the slower chirp rate,
the filter response is approximately a superposition of steady-state responses as the frequency
changes (i.e., the response is quasi-stationary). At the higher chirp rate, the filter response can no
longer be approximated as a sum of steady-state responses (i.e., it is no longer quasi-stationary).
After [34].

    a 30 MHz-bandwidth 1 GHz filter excited by a 1 µs-long linear chirp from
    950 MHz to 1050 MHz with a chirp rate of 20 MHz/µs. This is a relatively
    slow chirp. The chirp starts at 0 µs and stops at 5 µs. Thus the frequency
    of the chirp is in-band at 1.75 µs and is out-of-band at 3.25 µs. The chirp is
    sufficiently slow that the transient transmission response corresponds to the
    frequency response of the filter. However, if the chirp is fast, the resonators
    may not reach steady state, and then the transient response of the filter
    cannot be simply extrapolated from its frequency-domain response. This is
    seen in Figure 2-77(b), which is the response of the filter to a fast chirp with
    a chirp rate of 400 MHz/µs and a chirp duration of 250 ns, and beginning
    at 950 MHz and ending at 1050 MHz. The RF chirp begins out of band at
    0 ns, becomes in-band at 0.0875 µs, and goes out-of-band again at 0.1625 µs
    before turning off at 0.25 µs. Interestingly, there is an almost immediate
    output response, around 0.03 µs when the RF chirp is out of band. Overall the
    chirped-filter response does not follow the frequency response of the filter.

       Another view of the same phenomenon is examined for a 7th-order
    Chebyshev filter with a center frequency of 900 GHz and 34 MHz bandwidth
    from 883 MHz to 917 MHz. The frequency-domain transmission response of
    the filter is shown in Figure 2-78. The transmission responses to 0.25 µs-long
    RF pulses of different frequencies are shown in Figure 2-79. The frequency of
    the RF pulse is shown in each subplot. The top-left plot is the response when
    the RF pulse is in-band. Here the RF pulse is applied at 0 µs and removed
    at 0.25 µs. An initial delay in the transmission response and what is referred
    to as a long-tail response is seen when the RF pulse is removed. The other
    plots in Figure 2-79 show the filter response as the RF is backed off from the
    passband. So, even when the RF is out of band, there can be an appreciable
    output from the filter at the beginning and end of the RF pulse.

2.19 Summary

Radio frequency and microwave filter design combines the mathematical
synthesis of a circuit with the required performance and the intuitive
realization that particular structures inherently have a desired frequency
selectivity. The art of filter design is to direct the mathematical synthesis
and companion circuit so that the circuit structures in the synthesized filter
prototype match the functionality of physical microwave structures. A very
important step in this process is the development of circuit equivalent
models of physical structures. Once a microwave filter with appropriate
topology has been designed and the close-to-final physical filter is designed,
the physical layout is optimized in a circuit simulator to account for
72                                          STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

parasitics and higher-order EM effects.
   A similar design procedure applies to active filter designs where particular

circuit topologies, for example, the biquad network blocks, are identified and
exploited. The synthesis approach provides design insight and exploitation
of all parameters of a transfer function, leading to optimum network
topologies. Synthesis can be time consuming and specialized, but it is the
only way to develop filters with optimum performance. Insight gained
during design identifies yield issues and provides the basis for inventing
new filter topologies.

Further Reading

The design of microwave filters has a rich tradition. Many excellent books
and articles have been written about microwave filter design techniques.
Books and articles with extensive treatments are references [1, 3, 4, 14, 16-19,
35-46]. However the most important systematic approaches to microwave
filter design were presented in this chapter. Many journal and conference
papers present topologies in various technologies that can be used to
implement filters. The best way to locate these papers is to search using the
specifics of the technology of interest. For example "wideband microstrip
bandstop filters on glass substrates" will yield a list of papers on the
topic. There are many small companies that specialize in different types of
filter design. For very high performance filters, for example in basestation
applications, the number of designers and vendors is quite small and filter
designers follow the literature and patents closely. For designers building
microwave systems with small to medium volumes the best approach is to
use microstrip design. For bandpass microstrip design the most common
choice is to use filter design based on coupled microstrip design which is
considered in the next chapter.

3.1 Introduction

Central to microwave filter design is the identification of a particular
distributed structure that inherently has the desired frequency-shaping
attributes. Then this structure is adjusted to match an ideal mathematical,
or perhaps lumped-element, representation of a filter. Filter design is
both science and art, matching synthesis with instinctive knowledge of
appropriate physical and circuit structures.

   A large number of microwave filters are realized using coupled
transmission lines and the most important of these are parallel coupled
line (PCL) filters. These are derived from prototypes, with the development
following a strategy that enables the filter to be realized using one of several
coupled-line configurations. So the strategy is to first examine coupled-line
configurations and determine the types of circuit structures that can be
realized. Then the steps in synthesis are designed to go from an LC filter
prototype to a prototype that has the structures that can be realized by a
coupled-line configuration.

   Since the beginnings of microwave circuit synthesis, it has become
common to present circuit concepts using examples, very often because the
steps in realizing a filter may be too difficult to specify algorithmically and
there are many steps that require intuition. This procedure is followed here.

   This introduction concludes with an example that illustrates the art and
science of microwave engineering. It is seen that a simple pair of coupled
lines with appropriate matching has a bandpass filter response. The intrinsic
bandpass response is supported by coupled lines, so the synthesis procedure
is adapting the intrinsic response to specifications.

EXAMPLE 3.1 Coupled Lines as a Basic Element of a Bandpass Filter

               Design Environment Project File: RFDesign Coupled Shorted Microstrip Lines C.emp

     A coupled pair of microstrip lines terminated in short circuits is shown in Figure 3-1. This
     circuit has a bandpass response centered at 7.5 GHz, as shown in Figure 3-2. So while the
      insertion loss reduces to about 3.5 dB at 7.5 GHz, the return loss is not very high. This is a
      good indication that matching could be used to reduce the insertion loss. So the problem is
      then one of determining the appropriate matching network and to do this an understanding
     of the circuit response needs to be gained. Figure 3-3 plots the S11 and S21 responses on
      a Smith chart. By looking at S11 it is seen that between 7 and 8 GHz the input impedance
      is primarily inductive. This indicates that a series capacitance could be used in matching.
     Another view is shown in Figure 3-4, which plots the magnitude and phase of the input
      impedance at Port 1 of the coupled microstrip lines (this will be the same as the input
      impedance at Port 2). So around 7 GHz, the input impedance is inductive since the phase
      of the impedance is close to 90 and the magnitude of the impedance is increasing with
      frequency. At 7 GHz the impedance is approximately 50 , which would be resonated out by
      a series capacitor of 0.45 pF. However it will not be as simple as this, as the tuning capacitor
      will need to be placed at both Ports 1 and 2. However, this does serve to provide an initial
      design point.

           The schematic required to implement the design above is shown in Figure 3-5. In
     this circuit schematic, the coupled line shown in Figure 3-1(b) is captured as a subcircuit
      called "CoupledLine." The series capacitors at Ports 1 and 2 are "C1" and "C2," that is,
      C1 and C2, respectively. C1 and C2 are established as tunable elements with the governing
      variable being "CC." This capacitor is tuned to obtain the optimum bandpass response. With
     C1 = C2 = 44.8 fF, the bandpass response shown in Figure 3-6 is obtained. This is an
      almost ideal maximally flat bandpass filter response. The main passband is at 7 GHz and
      there is a parasitic bandpass response at the third harmonic. This spurious passband at an
      odd harmonic occurs often in transmission line designs. A small alteration of the tuning
      capacitor can change the response to have ripples in the passband and sharper filter skirts
     (see Figure 3-7), where the tuning capacitors are each 37.6 fF. (To convince yourself of the
      sharper skirt consider the insertion loss at 100 MHz away from the passband. The insertion
      loss of the filter with the maximally flat response is 23 dB there, and that of the filter with
      the ripple response is 27 dB.) This filter has two passband poles and is simple enough to
      design as done here. Higher-order filters (with more than two passband resonators) require
      a more sophisticated design approach. Still this example demonstrates that the coupled-line
      structure has a good passband response on its own provided that appropriate matching is
      used.

          The bandpass characteristic is a result of the phase velocities of the even and odd modes
      being different. If they were the same, the transmission coefficient would be zero at 7 GHz.

                   3.2 Parallel Coupled Lines

                       Several of the key advantages of coupled-line filters over other distributed
                       filters is that the coupling between resonators can be strong if the pair of
                       coupled-line resonators are close to each other, or low if they are widely
                       separated. This enables filters to be realized with high (30-70%), medium
                       (10-30%), or low (2-10%) bandwidths. The low-bandwidth filters require
                       low coupling of the resonators, while the high bandwidth filters require high
                       coupling. Coupled-line filters are also compact and can be implemented in
                       microstrip configurations or most of the other transmission line technologies.
                       The different transmission line forms have different Qs. Planar transmission
                       lines have moderate Qs especially at high frequencies, due principally to

the filter skirts will not be as steep as they would be if a high-Q transmission

3.2.1 Coupled-Line Configurations

The coupled-line configuration considered in Example 3.1 is called a
combline section. This is one of many that have desirable frequency-selective
responses. The characteristics of many parallel coupled-line configurations
having bandpass, all-pass, or all-stop characteristics are shown in Table 3-1.
The most important configurations are starred ().

   The PCL section of Filter (a) in Table 3-1 is called an interdigital section and
is a bandpass filter. The dual filter is Filter (b), with what is called a parallel
coupled section, and both can be used to realize narrow (2-3%) to wide (up
to 30%) bandwidth filters with close to symmetrical responses around the
center frequency f0. For a wide bandwidth filter the lines are close and for
a narrow bandwidth filter the parallel lines are widely separated so that
there is low-level coupling. Filter (c) is also a bandpass filter, however, the
frequency selectivity is not as good as with Filters (a) and (b). Filters (d),
(e), and (f) are all-pass filters. These filters are used to adjust the phase of
a transmitted signal, usually to accommodate phase dispersion (e.g., phase
variation with respect to frequency) that was introduced somewhere else.
While this analog function was once important, it is less so now as DSP
techniques can usually equalize the phase sufficiently. Filter (g) is an all-
stop filter, meaning that negligible signal is transmitted. This filter has no
practical use. Filters (h) and (i) are inherently all-stop filters. An example of
the response of the combline section of Filter (h) was seen in Figure 3-2 of
Example 3.1, where the all-stop response is centered at 4 GHz. The response
is too broad to be useful as a bandstop filter (in any practical application).

                        However, with minimal matching, such as a series capacitor at each of ports
                        (see Figure 3-5), the combline section becomes a very good bandpass filter
                        (see Figures 3-6 and 3-7). The combline bandpass filter, Filter (h), is more
                        compact than Filters (a) and (b). However, it has an asymmetrical bandpass
                        response (which can be seen in Figure 3-7(a)), whereas Filters (a) and (b)
                        have a symmetrical frequency response. Which type of response is preferred
                        depends on the application. Filter (i) is the dual of Filter (h), but in practice

the combline configuration of Filter (h) is preferred.
   Table 3-2 presents coupled-line sections having lowpass and bandstop

responses. All of these filters have desirable characteristics and so all are
starred (). Filter (l) is not a PCL filter but it is used in trade-off among the
three lowpass filters (i.e., Filters (j), (l) and (m)). The usual application of a
bandstop filter is to notch out an undesired signal (e.g. to prevent an LO from
appearing where it is not desired). As such, the desired frequency response
is narrowband and Filter (m) is a good choice for a bandstop filter.

   Filter design using PCL sections begins with the choice of a PCL
configuration having the essential desired frequency response. Each of the
PCL sections in Tables 3-1 and 3-2 have two resonators and can implement
bandpass, bandstop, and lowpass filters having second-order responses.1 To
meet specifications it is generally necessary to replicate the basic section. So
treating the two resonator configurations as unit cells, a multi-cell filter can
be realized. The multi-cell forms of the main bandpass configurations are
shown in Table 3-3. The multi-cell implementation of the interdigital, parallel

1 Recall that the order designation comes from the lowpass prototype so that here a second-
  order bandpass filter actually has two resonators, each having an LC-like response.

    edge-coupled bandpass filters, (a) and (b) in Tables 3-3, is straightforward.
    A variation is shown in Filter (c), which folds the parallel edge-coupled
    sections to realize a compact multi-cell form called a hairpin filter [1-3].
    One of the consequences of using transmission line segments to realize a
    filter is that there are spurious passbands. This results because a /4 section
    of line looks the same electrically as a 3/4 section. Consequently there
    are normally spurious passbands at the odd-harmonic frequencies. If the
    basic resonator is /2 long, then the spurious passbands would be at all
    of the harmonic frequencies. A solution is to incorporate capacitors in the

resonators as shown in Filter (e) in Table 3-3 [2, 4, 5]. Thus each of the original
transmission line resonators now becomes a combination of a capacitor and
a shorter transmission line segment. If the new transmission line segment
is /8 long, the first spurious passband will now be at 5f0 rather than 3f0.
The spurious passbands can be pushed further up in frequency by using
even shorter transmission line lengths, but the performance of the filter at
the passband frequency, f0, will be compromised.

   There are many variations on the PCL filter and several different design
techniques have been developed [6-28]. Refer to these citations to explore
alternative PCL configurations and alternative methods of design to that
presented here. This chapter presents one of the common approaches to
synthesizing PCL filters and the scheme accommodates the use of capacitive
loading used to extend the stopband of a passband filter.

   Before launching into the synthesis procedure for a PCL filter, a comment
on synthesis versus optimization is warranted. With a simple topology such
as the second-order filter topologies shown in Table 3-1, an optimization
procedure could be used to design the widths and lengths of the lines and
the two or four variables describing the required external matching networks
that are not shown. A global optimization is certainly feasible. However, it is
not feasible to use global optimization of, for example, a seventh-order filter
required to meet typical cell phone specifications. An exception is if a design
for a very similar specification is available and the changes required are
small. Competitive filter design requires synthesis. This will lead to optimum
performance, and the insight gained can be used in topology modifications.

3.2.2 Coupled-Line Circuit Models

An approximate coupled-line model of a pair of coupled lines was presented
in Section 5.9.5 of [29]. This model is repeated in Figure 3-9. The parameters
of the network model are related to the model impedances as follows:

   n = 1 = Z0e + Z0o  (3.1)        Z01 =  Z0S ,        (3.3)
         K Z0e - Z0o  (3.2)        1 - K2              (3.4)
                                              
Z0S = (Z0eZ0o),                               1 - K2
                                   Z02 = Z0S       2.
                                                K

   Various terminating arrangements of the coupled lines result in several
useful filter elements. One arrangement is shown in Figure 3-10. Also shown
in this figure is the development of the network model based on the model
in Figure 3-9. The final network model is a transmission line of characteristic
impedance Z01 in cascade with an open-circuited stub. Consider what
happens at the resonant frequency, fr (the frequency at which the lines are
one-quarter wavelength long). At lower frequencies, f  fr, the Z02 line

Figure 3-10: Lowpass distributed network section derived from a pair of coupled lines with Port
1 open-circuited. The open circuit is indicated by a node (open circle) with a line through it. The
final network model is a transmission line of characteristic impedance Z01 and an open-circuited
stub of characteristic impedance Z02. The lines and stubs are one-quarter wavelength long at the
corner frequency. (Thus with the stub fr = f0, and the characteristic impedance of the stub is as
shown.)

    is an open circuit and signals travel along Z01. At resonance the Z02 stub
    becomes a short circuit and signals do not pass. This is a crude verification
    that this is a lowpass structure. The process is visual and is expected to be
    self-explanatory. Other examples are shown in Figures 3-11 to 3-13.

       The model of a combline section is shown in Figure 3-13. The final network
    reduction is repeated in Figure 3-14, and it will be shown that the model in
    Figure 3-14(b) is equivalent to the model in Figure 3-14(a). In the synthesis
    of a combline filter, the network of Figure 3-14(b) is obtained and this can be

related back to the dimensions of the coupled line. The equivalence is done
using ABCD parameters and, as will be seen, the equivalence will not be
at just one frequency but will be broadband. The ABCD parameters of the
network in Figure 3-14(a) are obtained by cascading the ABCD parameters
of three two-ports (the ABCD parameters of which are given in Table 2-1
of [30]). The ABCD parameters of the network in Figure 3-14(a) are (from

                             Z011Z022         =  Z01

                                    1 + Z012 = n,
                                         Z011

    which have the solution

                                              Z012 = Z02

              n - 1 n(n - 1)                          Z02 - (n - 1)Z01

    Rearranging these, expressions for Z01, Z02, and n can be obtained:

    Z012                       nZ011Z022         

    n = 1 + Z011 , Z01 = Z011 + Z022 + Z012 , and Z02 = nZ02Z012.             (3.20)

    Using these, Equations (3.1)-(3.4), and the coupled-line analysis of Section
    5.6 of [29], the geometric parameters of the combline coupled-line section
    can be obtained corresponding to the stub circuit of Figure 3-14(b).

       Thus the equivalent circuit of the combline section, the top left figure in
    Figure 3-13, has the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 3-14. Filter synthesis
    can be directed at developing circuit structures like that in Figure 3-14(b)
    and from this electrical design, the physical design consisting of combline
    sections can be developed.

impedances except for J, y and y1, which are admittances. The use of the equivalent networks
in filter synthesis is illustrated in the case study in Section 3.4.

3.3 Inverter Network Scaling

A filter that uses transmission lines is nearly always synthesized from
a filter prototype that contains inverters. The synthesis of a filter begins
with a normalized prototype that is transformed to the desired frequency,
impedance, and type. It is the purpose of this section to show how to use such
scaling when there are inverters in the prototype. In particular, it is shown
that scaling the admittance of the network of Figure 3-15(a), a common
inverter subnetwork, by a factor x results in the network in Figure 3-15(c).

   The nodal admittance matrix of the network in Figure 3-15(a) is

         0 -J 0                              (3.21)
  Y =  -J y -J  .

             0 -J 0

Assigning nodal voltages to Terminals 1, 2, and 3, the nodal admittance
matrix equation is

             
  0 -J 0                       v1        J1

 -J y -J   v2  =  0  ,                       (3.22)

  0 -J 0                       v3        J3

and by eliminating Node 2 using network condensation (see Section 1.A.16)
of [31], this reduces to

   J 2/y J 2/y   v 2 2 1   = J1  ,           (3.23)
  J /y J /y v3                       J3

and this describes the external characteristics of the subnetwork in Figure
3-15(a).
92                  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

    The nodal admittance matrix of the scaled network in Figure 3-15(c) is

                                     -J x                                                               (3.24)
                                  0     yx         0
                                               -J x  .
                    Y  =  -J x       -J x          0
                                  0

    That is,

                        -J x                      
                     0     yx        0         v1           J1

               -J x     -J x   -J x   v2  =  0  ,                                                       (3.25)
                     0
                                     0         v3           J3

    and by eliminating Node 2 this reduces to

     (J2x)/(yx)     (J 2x)/(yx)   v1   J 2/y       J 2/y   v 2 1   = J1  .
       (J 2x)/(yx)  (J 2x)/(yx) v3 = J 2/y         J /y v3      J3

                                                                                                        (3.26)

    Thus the original network shown in Figure 3-15(a) has the same external
    electrical characteristics as the scaled network of Figure 3-15(c), with the
    characteristic admittance of the inverters scaled by x and the shunt
    admittance scaled by x.

       A generalization of this result (which is useful when there are additional
    connections between Nodes 1 and 3) is that multiplying a row and a column
    of the nodal admittance matrix by the same factor results in identical external
    characteristics. Note that the element sharing a row and column is multiplied
    twice.

EXAMPLE 3.2 Inductor Synthesis

      Lumped inductors have low Q. Fortunately, in microwave design they can be realized using
     inverters and a shunt capacitor that have a high Q. Realize the series inductor in Figure 3-
     16(a) with a shunt capacitor and 10  impedance inverters.

      Solution:

      The series inductor in a 1  system is transformed into a network with inverters and a
     shunt capacitor using the transformation shown in Figure 2-48. Thus here the series inductor
     can be realized by the circuit of Figure 3-16(b), where the shunt capacitor C has the same
      numeric value as the series inductor. The inverters here can be either impedance inverters or
      admittance inverters, as their value is equal to one. The design requires that these be realized
     as 10  inverters, but scaling is performed on admittance inverters, as shown in Figure 3-

                                                                                          
     16(c), where the value of the admittance inverters is 0.1 S = x. Thus x = 0.01 and the
      admittance of the capacitor is scaled by 0.01, so C1 = C/100 = 10 pF. The final design is
     shown in Figure 3-16(d).

3.4 Case Study: Third-Order Chebyshev Combline Filter
       Design

This section presents the design of a 1 GHz third-order Chebyshev combline
bandpass filter with 10% bandwidth. The combline filter is one of the most
commonly used transmission line-based filters and uses the combline section
shown in Figure 3-13. The synthesis that will be presented here combines
many of the concepts discussed previously in this chapter. There are also
design decisions that must be made in response to particular situations
encountered during synthesis. An example of a design decision is deciding
what to do if the characteristic impedance of a transmission line is too low.

Step 1: Choice of Lowpass Filter Prototype

Design begins with the choice of a prototype that is expected to achieve
the required specifications. If the choice is eventually found to be not
suitable, then another topology must be chosen and the synthesis restarted.
Consider a third-order Chebyshev lowpass filter prototype, shown in Figure
3-17, with a passband ripple factor of  = 0.1 (or 0.043 dB). The element
values were calculated using Equations (2.83)-(2.90). Note that at the corner
frequency that defines the bandwidth of the lowpass filter, the square of
the transmission coefficient is the ripple level (see Figure 2-7). That is, at
frequency 0 = 1 rad/s, the squared transmission coefficient is 1/(1 + 2)
(or in decibels the ripple is RdB = 10 log(1 + 2)).

Step 2: Replace Series Elements

The next step in the transformation of the lowpass prototype in Figure 3-
17 is replacing the series inductor by a shunt capacitor in cascade with
admittance inverters, as shown in Figure 3-18. This step uses the series
inductor transformation shown in Figure 2-16.

                  Step 3: Bandpass Filter Transformation

                  In synthesizing the bandpass filter the final physical topology must be
                  considered. The essential element of a third-order combline filter comprises
                  three coupled lines as shown in Figure 3-19(a). The three resonators can be
                  modeled as two pairs of coupled lines, as shown in Figure 3-19(b), with one
                  line shared by each pair. Each pair of coupled lines can be modeled by a Pi
                  network of stubs as shown in Figure 3-14(b). Thus the lowpass prototype of
                  Figure 3-18(b) needs to be converted to a bandpass filter and eventually this
                  needs to be transformed into two cascaded Pi networks of stubs.

                     In this step the prototype is converted to a bandpass circuit. The filter
                  has 10% bandwidth with approximate corner frequencies at f1 = 950 MHz
                  and f2 = 1050 MHz. Using the filter type transformations in Figure 2-27,
                  0 = 2109, and  = 0/(2 - 1) = 1/(fractional bandwidth) = 10, the first
                  capacitor in Figure 3-18, C11, is transformed to

                   C11                                         1
                  C1 =     = 1355.33 pF in parallel with L1 =             = 0.0186894 nH.
                        0                                      C110

                                                                                     (3.27)

                  The other capacitors are transformed similarly and the bandpass prototype
                  becomes that shown in Figure 3-20.

                     The lumped-element version of the bandpass filter is shown in Figure 3-
                  21 along with its simulated response. This response is the ideal electrical
                  response and provides a reference in design. Note that the ripples in the
                  transmission response, i.e. S21, are not evident on this scale. Losses in the
                  implemented filter will smooth the ripples even further although the poles
                  in the S21 response are not evident, these correspond to the zeros in the S11
                  response and these are clearly visible. Figure 3-21 shows three zeros in the
                  S11 response, as expected for a third-order filter.

Step 4: Impedance Scaling

The system impedance is now scaled from 1 to 50 , leading to the prototype
in Figure 3-22 (derived from Figure 3-20).

Step 5: Conversion of Lumped-Element Resonators

Each lumped-element resonator in Figure 3-22 comprises a capacitor and
an inductor. The inductors are particularly difficult to realize efficiently and
have high loss. The idea is to replace each lumped resonator (e.g., C1 and
L1 in Figure 3-22) with a network comprising a lumped capacitor and a
transmission line stub.

Equivalence of a Capacitively-Loaded Stub and an LC Resonator

Here it will be shown that a capacitively-loaded stub is a broadband
approximation of a lumped LC resonator. The resonator equivalence is
shown in Figure 3-23. The equivalence is first developed at frequency f0 =
0/(2) by making sure that the circuits have the same admittance at the

       and has a radian frequency derivative of

                        =                                           .            (3.29)

          Now consider a short-circuited stub that is resonant at radian frequency
       r; that is, the short-circuited stub is one-quarter wavelength long at r.
       From Equation (2.100) of [29], the input impedance at  is

                   Z1 = Z01 tan                                     .            (3.30)

       Thus for the lumped-distributed network in Figure 3-23(b), the input
       admittance is

                                           resonator in a bandpass filter. The line is resonant at the
               At  = r/2,
                   = 45, Z1 = Z01          radian frequency r and so the electrical length of the line
                                           is  = 90. Using the design choice here, the filter center
                                           passband frequency  = r/2, and so  = 45 and so the
                                           input impedance of the shorted stub is Z1 = Z01.

Specific Design Choice, r = 20

At this stage a design choice must be made regarding the relationship of 0
and r; that is, the resonant frequency of the stub in relation to the resonant
frequency of the resonator (which is also the center frequency of the filter
passband). Here a shorted stub is considered that is resonant when it is /4
long. The specific design choice made here is that the resonant frequency
of the stub, fr, is twice the center frequency of the filter passband, i.e.
r = 20. This is a common design choice. The consequence of this choice
is illustrated in Figure 3-24. The frequency fr is called the commensurate
frequency to avoid confusion resulting from the resonant frequency of the
filter resonators being different from the resonant frequency of stub2. The
stub design proceeds as follows.

   The equivalence expressed by Equations (3.33) and (3.34) is established at
the center of the passband (i.e., at 0). Now  = 0 = 12 r, so Equations
(3.28), (3.31), and (3.33) become

That is,                                                               .

Another relationship comes from equating derivatives. From Equations
                                              21 r       tan( 2  r  )          
(3.29), (3.32), and  (3.34), and  with     =        and                =  tan  4  =  1,

r2LC + 4             =21   2C0Z01  1  2    +    +    =   C0Z01r2 + 2           .         (3.39)

Substituting for C0 from Equation (3.38) and rearranging, the characteristic
impedance of the stub is

                                Z01 = rL 1 +  .                                          (3.40)

2 Of course there are resonant frequencies at every multiple of one-quarter wavelength. The
  first resonance occurs at fr, as then the input impedance of the short-circuited stub is an open
  circuit. The characteristic that establishes resonance is that the input is either an open- or short-
  circuit and energy is stored.

Z1 = Z01, Z2 = Z02, and
Z3 = Z03 since the resonant fre-
quencies of the stubs are twice that
of the design center frequency, i.e.
fr = 2f0.

    In the passband the input impedance of the stub is

                                      Z1 = Z01 tan() = Z01 tan(/4) = Z01.                (3.41)

    Thus the broadband (30%) approximation of the parallel LC resonant
    circuit is a capacitively-loaded stub, see Figure 3-23(b), of length /8 at the

    resonant frequency of the LC resonator. The resonant frequency of each stub,
    i.e. the frequency fr at which they are /4 long, is twice the design center
    frequency f0, i.e. fr = 2f0. So the concept used here is that the resonant
    frequency of a stub does not need to be the same as the design center

    frequency. It is common for all the stubs in a design to have the same resonant
    frequency fr and this is specified in the design documentation. In general fr
    can have any relationship to f0 but the most common situation is fr = 2f0 as
    used here.

    Returning to Step 5

    For this filter, the center of the passband is 1 GHz, and so 0 = 2109 and
    r = 20 = 2(2 · 109) defines the stub resonant frequency as 2 GHz. The
    first resonator in Figure 3-22 with L = 0.934468 nH and C = 27.1066 pF can
    be replaced by the capacitively-loaded stub in Figure 3-23(b). where, from
    Equation (3.40),

        Z01 = 7.54713 , and from Equation (3.38), C0 = 21.0881 pF. (3.42)

    This process is repeated for each lumped-element resonator in Figure 3-22,
    leading to the prototype shown in Figure 3-25.

    Steps 6 and 7: Equating Characteristic Impedances of Stubs

    The stubs in Figure 3-25 can be physically realized using transmission

    line segments. It would be ideal if the impedances of the stubs (i.e., the

    impedances looking into the stubs) are identical. To achieve this, the method

    of nodal admittance matrix scaling described in Section 3.3 is used with the

    impedance inverters multiplied by Z01/Z02 and the admittance, C2//Z2,
                                      (C 
    divided  by  Z01/Z02                     is  divided  by  Z01/Z02,  and  Z2  is  multiplied  by
                                          2

    Z01/Z02). This step scales each inverter impedance to 56.9084  and also sets

    the characteristic impedance of all the shunt stubs to 7.54713 . The combline

    filter is now as shown in Figure 3-26.

    In Section 2.8.6 it was shown that a good narrowband model of an inverter

    is a Pi network of stubs. So the inverter in the current filter design, shown

    in Figure 3-27(a), is modeled by the lumped-element circuit in Figure 3-27(b)

    and the stub circuit shown in Figure 3-27(c).

Stub Impedance When fr = 2f0

The most common design choice is to select the resonant (i.e., the
commensurate) frequency of the stubs to be twice the center frequency of
the design. With fr = 2f0, Equation (2.114) becomes

                     Z0 =            1      =             1        = 1 = K.                (3.43)
                            J tan     0                               J
                                     2 20                    
                                                 J tan 4

   Equation (3.43) defines the characteristic impedance of the transmission
line stubs realizing an inverter. Then the elements of the subnetwork in
Figure 3-27(b) all have the admittance magnitude

                        J = 1/K = 1/(56.9084 ) = 17.5721 mS                                (3.44)

and the stubs in Figure 3-27(c) have the characteristic impedance

        Z0 = 1 = K = K                                              = 56.9084 .            (3.45)

                                                     2 r     =0

   At this stage there are several pairs of stubs in parallel. Figure 3-28
illustrates how a pair of parallel stubs can be replaced by a single stub. Now
the prototype is as shown in Figure 3-29.

Step 8: Scaling Characteristic Impedances of Stubs

The filter will be realized using coupled microstrip lines and a general

statement can be made about how the stubs in the prototype in Figure

3-29 correspond to the physical structure of the coupled lines. The stubs

with    characteristic  impedances   Z0 1,  Z ,   and        Z     are  largely  realized  by  the

quency fr = 2f0.                    Z01 = 8.70106  = Z03

                  require a wide microstrip line. The stubs with characteristic impedances Z012
                  and Z023 each correspond to coupling between pairs of microstrip lines with
                  high impedances corresponding to low-level coupling and widely spaced
                  microstrip lines.

                     In Figure 3-29 the short-circuited shunt stubs have characteristic
                  impedances of 8.7  and 10.3 , which are too low, and will result in wide
                  microstrip lines.3 These need to be scaled to a higher impedance level to raise
                  the characteristic impedances of the short-circuited stubs to an acceptable
                  value. Note that the characteristic impedance of the middle shunt short-
                  circuited stub can be raised to 80  if the system impedance is raised from
                  50  to 389.426 . Doing this leads to the element values shown in the
                  bandpass circuit of Figure 3-30.

                  Step 9: Scaling to a 50  System Impedance

                  The previous step raised the system impedance (the required source and
                  load impedances) to an unreasonably high level (389.426 ). For the filter to
                  operate in a 50  system, input and output impedance inverters are required
                  to scale the source and load back to 50 . The resulting circuit is shown in

                  3 What is reasonable for the width of a microstrip line is subjective and based on experience.
                    With a substrate having r = 10, the width required for a characteristic impedance, Z0, of
                    30-80  is reasonable. A line with Z0 < 30  will be very wide, use too much area, and
                    potentially lead to multi-moding. A line with Z0 > 80  will be narrow, close to the maximum
                    Z0 that can be realized in a technology, have manufacturing tolerance issues, and have large
                    radiation. The range can be extended to 20-100  but typically with degraded performance.

                    Also see Example 3.4 of [29] for a microstrip design guideline.

3.4.1 Realization of the Input/Output Inverters

At this stage the design is as shown in Figure 3-31, where the inverters at
the input and output remain to be synthesized. There are many possible
realizations of the inverters. Focusing on just the output inverter with a load
RL, as shown in Figure 3-32(a), it will be shown here how this can be realized
using the capacitive network of Figure 3-32(b).

   The input admittance of the inverter plus load resistor of Figure 3-32(a) is

                        Yin = K2 RL ,                            (3.46)

and the input admittance of the circuit in Figure 3-32(b) is

     Yin = sCa +                       1.                        (3.47)
                        1/(sCb) + RL

Thus, equating the real parts of Equations (3.46) and (3.47),

     and the inverters shown in Figure 3-31 can be replaced by the capacitive
     networks shown in Figure 3-33. This capacitive network is not a general
     replacement of an inverter. It only works when the inverter is terminated
     in a resistor. Note that Ca is negative, and this is absorbed in the first and
     last resonators so that the final lumped-distributed realization is as shown in
     Figure 3-34. This is the electrical design of the bandpass filter in a form that
     can be realized using the combline connection of coupled lines.

     3.4.2 Implementation

     The filter designed in the previous section can be implemented using
     three parallel microstrip lines, as shown in Figure 3-35(a), where the three
     capacitors of the electrical design in Figure 3-34 appear directly in Figure 3-
     35(a). The double Pi connection of stubs shown in Figure 3-34, and again in
     Figure 3-36(a), becomes the three coupled lines shown in Figure 3-36(b).

     Derivation of Physical Dimensions

     The task now is to determine the dimensions of the three parallel microstrip
     lines. The dimensions to be determined are shown in Figure 3-36(b) and are
     the length of the lines, L, the widths of the three lines, w1, w2, and w3, and
     the gaps s1 and s2. The approach is to consider that the three parallel lines
     form two coupled-line pairs with each pair of coupled lines implementing a
     Pi network of stubs. The physical design procedure is outlined in Figure 3-36
     with one of the lines shared. This, of course, is an approximation but a fairly
PARALLEL COUPLED-LINE FILTERS                                                    103

accurate one. The physical synthesis of a pair of coupled lines is outlined in
Figure 3-37 where the parameters of the Pi model, Figure 3-37(a), lead to the
parameters of the transmission lines in the combline model, Figure 3-37(b).
This then leads to the parameters defining the pair of coupled lines, Figure
3-37(c), in particular the even and odd-mode characteristic impedances, Z0e
and Z0o and the system impedance Z0S.

   Using the quantities in Figure 3-37(a) and rearranging Equations (3.14)-
(3.16), the parameters of the coupled-line model in Figure 3-37(b) are
obtained as follows:

n = 1 + Z012 ,   Z02 = nZ012 and Z01 = n        Z011Z022      . (3.51)
           Z011                           Z011 + Z022 + Z012

For the left pair (and also for the right pair because of symmetry)) of coupled
lines in Figure 3-36(d), Z012 = Z0t12 = 443.232 , Z011 = Z0t1 = 67.7683 ,

of the filter involves transforming the electrical design in (c) into the physical design in (d).
Similarly the circuit in (e) is transformed into the layout in (f). With a shared central stub, the

   The physical parameters of the coupled line pair in Figure 3-37(c) are
derived using the results in Section 5.9.6 of [29]. Thus

           K = 1/n = 0.1326.                                (3.53)

From Equations (5.197) and (5.198) of [29] two estimates of the system
impedance, Z0S, are obtained:

           Z0S,(3.54) = Z01 1 - K2 = 68.56                  (3.54)
                                                            (3.55)
           Z0S,(3.55) = Z02           K2   2 = 59.30 .

                                      1-K

These two values of Z0S are different and this is because the Pi arrangement
of stubs is not symmetrical (i.e., in Figure 3-37(a) (Z011 = 67.7 ) = Z( 022 =
80 )).5 The assumption behind the development of Equations (3.3) and (3.4)

are that the pair of coupled lines is symmetrical. The only reasonable choice

is to use the geometric mean of the two values. So

           Z0S = Z0S,mean = Z0S,(3.54)Z0S,(3.55) = 63.77 .  (3.56)

Then, from Equation (5.202) of [29],

Z0o = Z0S  n - 1 = 55.80 ,          Z2             , and  Z0e = 1.306.
           n+1              Z0e = 0S Z = 72.87 0o         Z0o

                                                                     (3.57)

   The next step is to choose a substrate and realize the physical dimensions
of the coupled lines. It is important that there be dimensional stability
and that there be no multimoding. The best substrate for dimensional
stability is a hard substrate like alumina, sapphire, or glass. Soft substrates
like FR4 or teflon are too variable to be useful for filters. Alumina is
particularly attractive as it is very hard and dimensions are reproducible.
Alumina shrinks when it is processed but the amount of shrinkage is
well controlled and reproducible. So once a design has been physically
tuned, typically by drilling out part of the dielectric to change the effective
permittivity, filters can be reliably reproduced and require only a small
amount of adjustment. Alumina is polished to a well defined thickness
and with a relative permittivity of around 10 a 50- microstrip line has a
width approximately equal to the thickness of the substrate. Having equal
dimensions is a good thing to have for manufacturability. The thickness of
the substrate must be decided on at this stage in design. A thicker substrate
is less likely to crack during handling however a thicker substrate is more
likely to support multimoding. Here a (h =) 635 µm-thick alumina substrate
with r = 10 is chosen and calculations (not shown here) indicate that there
will not be multimoding at the filter's operating frequencies.

   Physical dimensions could be derived by iteratively solving for Z0e and
Z0o using the formulas in Section 5.6 of [29]. As an approximation, here the

5 Thus error is being introduced at this step. In reality the final manufactured filter will need
  to be tuned anyway as the filter will require tolerances of about 0.1% or better and the
  best manufactured dimensional tolerance is usually about 1%. Also material parameters are
  usually not known to better than 1%. So this is an error that must be accepted.
106  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     physical dimensions are derived from Table 5-3 of [29]. Table 5-3 of [29] is
     for a system impedance, Z0S, of 50  and not the 63.77  found here. Thus
     there will be an error, but it can be expected that there will be error in any
     case and these can be resolved using optimization in a simulator. From Table
     5-3 of [29], the initial physical dimensions of the pairs of lines are

       u = 0.93, w = uh = 591 µm, thus with rounding w1 = w2 = w3 = 600 µm
                                                                                                   (3.58)

       g = 1.0, s = gh = 635 µm, thus with rounding s1 = s2 = 650 µm (3.59)

     The rounding has been done as for EM simulation the lines will be laid out
     on a regular grid and a 50 µm grid is reasonable.

     Scaling of Line Width

     At this stage the error made with the characteristic impedance of the
     microstrip line should be considered. While any error can be corrected when
     optimizing the final design, making some correction at this stage will reduce
     the final adjustments needed. Three system impedances have been derived,
     Z0S,(3.54) = 68.56 , Z0S,(3.55) = 59.30 , and the geometric mean Z0S,mean =
     63.77 . This divergence is one source of error. Another source of error is
     that a table for a 50  system impedance was used to determine the coupled-
     line parameters. Note that the electrical design is exact and the tuning of the
     physical design will attempt to match the response of the physical circuit to
     that of the electrical design. However some initial corrections will reduce the
     amount of tuning that needs to be done.

        Scaling for the higher actual system impedance (63.77  versus 50 )
     means using higher impedance microstrip lines (which will be narrower)
     and higher coupling impedance (requiring a greater separation of the lines).
     There are three possible characteristic impedance to scale to and a design
     decision needs to be made. Should the lines be scaled from 50  to 54.2 ,
     68.6 , or 61.9 ? The most conservative approach is to scale from 50 
     to 54.2 , a factor of 1.08. Here only adjustment of the line widths will be
     considered and two correction approaches will be described. The first is
     based on the rule of thumb described in Example 3.4 of [29] which indicated
     that the characteristic impedance of the microstrip lines is approximately
     proportional to 1/ w. So the line width should be reduced by a factor of
     1.082 = 1.17 to shift the characteristic impedance. Thus the line width should
     be reduced from 600 µm to about 600 µm/1.17 = 512 µm or 500 µm after
     rounding.

        A second approach to correction is based on Table 3-3 of [29]. For  = 10
     and using the more conservative system impedance (i.e. 55.8  which is
     closest to 50 ), a better choice for u is to replace u = 0.93 by u = 0.78
     and, after rounding, w1 = w2 = w3 = 500 µm. This cannot be expected to
     completely correct for the error, but it should be closer than the choice of
     600 µm.

        Scaling the system impedance should also require that s be increased but
     there is not a simple guideline to follow and so this will be skipped. Another
     reason for needing to increase s is that there is more coupling in our coupled
     line system than that predicted by considering two pairs of coupled lines.
     For example, there is coupling from lines 1 directly to line 3. To reduce the
     coupling s will need to be increased, perhaps significantly. Another source

of increased coupling is that the phase velocities of the even and odd modes
differ. This tends to increase coupling. The adjustment of s is left to tuning of
the physical design in an EM simulator.

Line Lengths

The stubs are one-eighth wavelength long at the center frequency of the filter.
Thus the coupled lines are also one-eighth wavelength long. From Table 5-
3 of [29], the effective relative permittivity of the even mode is ee = 7.24
and for the odd mode is eo = 5.95. These are quite different so the best
that can be done is to use the geometric mean. Thus the effective relative

                             
permittivity is e = eeeo= 6.56. Thus at 1 GHz the line length L =

               
8/8 = 0/ e = (30 cm)/(8 6.56) = 14.64 mm (14.65 mm with rounding).
The use of a single effective permittivity in determining the lengths of the
lines is perhaps the largest error and will result in the resonant frequency of
each of the resonators, consisting of a capacitor (either C1, Ct2, or C3) and the
/8-long line, being shifted from 1 GHz. The resonators can be re-centered
by adjusting the capacitors. Adjusting the capacitance values also corrects
for error in the widths of the lines since the main effect of an error in the
width of a line is an error in its characteristic impedance and hence the input
impedance of the resonator stub.

Microwave Circuit Simulation

Before simulating the combline filter the lumped-element bandpass filter will
be considered to provide a benchmark. The 50- lumped-element bandpass
filter is shown in Figure 3-38. The responses of this filter is shown in Figures
3-39, 3-40, and 3-41. These responses provide a reference as the coupled-line

                         uses the coupled microstrip element line model, the MCLIN element, and
                         the filter model is as shown in Figure 3-35(b). The results of the circuit
                         simulation are shown in Figure 3-42. The curves (a) are responses for a gap of
                         s = 650 µm. The passband is too wide and this is reduced by increasing s to
                         1150 µm yielding curves (b). The effect of loss is seen with S21 less than 0 dB
                         in the passband. The S21 response has a slight slope down in the passband
                         and the S11 response does not show the three zeros seen in the lumped-
                         element response, see Figure 3-39.

                            Plotting the S11 response of the MCLIN-based filter on a Smith chart, see
                         Figure 3-43, provides more insight into what is happening. This should be
                         contrasted to the S11 response of the lumped-element filter shown in Figure

3-41. Recall that the lumped-element filter is the ideal electrical design.
The looping of S11 at the origin in Figure 3-41 indicates that the ideal
electrical response has three zeros as the locus of S11 passes through the
origin three times. This behavior corresponds to the poles of the transmission
response but these poles cannot be seen in the S21 response. Consequently in
optimizing a filter the designer focuses on the S11 response.

   Again consider the S11 responses of the two filters plotted on Smith charts
(i.e. Figures 3-41 and 3-43). The S11 response of the lumped-element filter
has two small loops corresponding to peaks in the in-band |S11| response
seen in the rectangular plot of Figure 3-39. In contrast, the locus of S11 of
the MCLIN-based filter does not go through the origin, see Figure 3-43, and
there is one loop although the hint of a second loop is seen at 1.06 GHz.
The performance is close to that required but optimization is necessary. In
manually optimizing, also called tuning, the design of the MCLIN-based
filter, both the rectangular and Smith chart plots should be overlaid with
the lumped-element response. By adjusting C1, Ct2, and C3 (by 6%, 16%,

     and 6% respectively), the resonant frequencies of the resonators are centered
     at 1 GHz and the filter response is also centered at 1 GHz6. The result of
     this tuning is shown in Figures 3-44 and 3-45 indicating that the required
     performance has been obtained.

        In Figure 3-44(a) the MCLIN-based filter response is compared to the
     lumped-element response. The bandwidths of the MCLIN and lumped-
     element implementations are closely matched. The MCLIN implementation
     has the steep skirts resulting from the Chebyshev prototype. The Smith chart
     plot of S11 of the MCLIN-based filter is shown in Figure 3-45. The loops seen
     with the lumped-element response, in Figure 3-41, are seen but now there is
     an additional rotation with respect to frequency. This is because the MCLIN-
     based filter has additional transmission-line delays and hence frequency-
     dependent phase shift. Also the S11 response in Figure 3-45 is rotated by
     180 from the S11 locus for the lumped-element filter (see Figure 3-41). This is
     because of the additional inverter at the input of the distributed filter design.

        Some gross features are seen in the combline response that are not seen
     in the ideal electrical response. Referring to Figure 3-44(a), these include the
     additional zero seen in the S21 response at 1.2 GHz, the steeper skirt above

     6 Approximately, the resonant frequency of a resonator is inversely proportional to C. So
       increasing the capacitances will reduce the center frequency of the filter.

the 1 GHz passband, and the less-steep skirt below the passband. These are
related. These features are common to PCL designs that use a combline. The
origin of this behavior is the additional transmission path directly from the
first line to the last line of the filter, the 1-3 coupling. During design the only
transmission path considered was from line 1 to line 2, and then from line 2
to line 3, the 1-2-3 coupling. Apparently, at 1.2 GHz the 1-3 and 1-2-3 signals
have the same magnitude but opposite phase and so cancel producing the
S21 zero. Above the passband the signals on the two paths destructively
interfere causing the steeper skirt. Below the passband the 1-3 and 1-2-3
signals constructively interfere and reduce the steepness of the filter skirt.
The additional zero can be exploited to significantly reduce the level of
a particular signal such as a local oscillator or a signal in a neighboring
communication band. If the reduced filter skirt below the passband is not
acceptable, then another arrangement of coupled lines should be used.

   Figure 3-44(b) is a wideband response of the MCLIN-based filter and
shows the spurious passbands that occur with most transmission-line based
networks. In this case the properties of the lines are the same at /8, 5/8,
and 9/8. So, by just considering the transmission lines alone it would be
expected that there would be spurious passbands at 5 GHz and 9 GHz. The
spurious passbands are lower because the impedances of the capacitances
reduce at the higher frequencies, resulting in the passbands at four times and
seven times the center frequency of the filter. In practice, a simple lowpass
filter eliminates the spurious passbands. Often parasitics in the system do
this without specific circuitry. Also, appropriate choice of matching networks
can provide adequate elimination of the spurious passbands.

   Before finalizing the filter layout, a more accurate EM simulation is
required instead of using the MCLIN element. The EM simulation captures
more subtle effects than can be included in the MCLIN model. The layout of
the parallel coupled lines is shown in Figure 3-35(d) and the connection to
incorporate these in a complete circuit simulation is shown in Figure 3-35(c).
The results of the EM-based simulation are shown in Figures 3-46 and 3-47. It
can be seen that the bandwidth of the filter reduces. Additional optimization
would result in the EM-based filter response more closely matching the ideal
electrical response.

     3.4.3 Alternative Combline Filter Layouts

     Up to a few gigahertz surface-mount capacitors can be used in the imple-
     mentation of the capacitively-loaded stubs. Above that other arrangements
     should be considered. There are several layout variations for the combline
     filter. The main variations relate to replacing the lumped-element capacitors
     by gap capacitors and alternative realizations of the input and output invert-
     ers. Several variations are shown in Figure 3-48. The layout in Figure 3-48(a)
     implements the capacitors using gap capacitors. At 1 GHz it is difficult to
     realize the required capacitance using gap capacitors, then the interdigitated
     capacitors shown in Figure 3-48(b) can be used to obtain higher capacitance
     values. Alternatively a coupled-line section can be used to implement the
     input and output inverters as shown in Figure 3-48(c).

     3.5 Parallel Coupled-Line Filters in an Inhomogeneous
            Medium

     A complexity arises when a parallel coupled-line filter is realized in an
     inhomogeneous transmission medium due to the inequality of the even- and
     odd-mode phase velocities. This effect can be investigated by utilizing the
     full ABCD matrix (see Equation (5.184) of [29].) of each PCL section in a filter
     for a known even- to odd-mode velocity ratio. The inhomogeneous medium
     can result in additional spurious passbands centered approximately at even
     multiples of f0 [4, 32-45]. This provides all the more reason to perform an
     accurate full EM simulation following filter synthesis.

     3.6 Summary

     Filters using parallel coupled-line (PCL) segments are an important class of
     microwave filters. There are various ways a pair of coupled lines, a four-
     port, can be configured using shorts and opens to realize a two-port network.
     Many of these PCL configurations have desirable frequency selectivity
     characteristics. That is, they inherently have the bandpass, lowpass,
     highpass, or bandstop characteristics desired of a filter. In particular, the
     various configurations often have very sharp responses. One drawback,
     however, is that they have spurious passbands that derive from a line and
     its counterpart that is one-half wavelength longer having the same input
     reflection coefficient. These spurious passbands can often be pushed up in
     frequency by setting, in the case of a bandpass filter, the resonant frequency
     of the transmission line resonators above the center frequency of the filter
     being developed.

        The synthesis of PCL filters follows the general microwave design
     philosophy of identifying a transmission line structure that inherently has
     the desired response. The combline filter, a type of PCL filter, considered
     in this chapter, for example, exploits the bandpass properties of coupled
     microstrip transmission lines that are all shorted at the same end. Once a
     filter with appropriate topology has been designed, the physical realization
     is optimized in a circuit simulator to account for parasitics and higher-order
     EM effects.

        While this chapter specifically addressed the design of PCL filters, the
     principles can be used with all distributed filter design. Bandpass filters
     are the most important microwave filter type and it was seen that a
     bandpass filter comprises coupled resonators. So other physical structures
     that present coupled resonators can also become components of a bandpass
     filter. The synthesis approach provides design insight and exploitation of all
     parameters of a transfer function. This leads to optimum network topologies.
     Synthesis can be time consuming and specialized, but it is the only way to
     develop filters with optimum performance.

4.1 Introduction

Measures of noise, distortion, and dynamic range are system metrics
describing the sensitivity of active systems and modules. In this chapter the
limitations described by these metrics will be discussed in a form that is
applicable to both active device design and system design using modules.
Noise and nonlinear distortion set the bounds on the range of signals that
can be processed by an RF circuit. Noise (i.e., random fluctuations of voltage
and current) establishes the minimum detectable signal, while nonlinear
distortion sets the level of the largest signal from which information can
be reliably extracted or which can be transmitted without affecting other
systems.

4.2 Noise

Fluctuations of voltage and current arise from several different physical
processes yielding noise with various statistical properties. Various types of
noise are important in electronic circuits and these types range from noise,
such as thermal noise, that is very well understood, to noise that has been
observed and seriously affect the performance of RF circuits but not well
understood. An example of the latter is phase noise on oscillators which
manifests itself as random fluctuations of the phase or frequency of an
oscillation signal. One of the problems in understanding noise is that it can be
difficult to describe a particular type of noise in both the time and frequency
124  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     domains. Not all types of noise can be described in a straightforward way
     and the sources of some types of noise are not understood. The impact of
     noise on an RF system is described in the frequency domain whereas the
     physical origins of noise must necessarily be in the real world (i.e., the time
     domain). The impact of noise is also in the time domain resulting in bit errors
     of a received, demodulated, and processed digitally modulated signal. Noise
     originating from a noise source is shaped by the characteristics of a circuit
     before it is observed externally and thus the true nature of noise is further
     obscured.

     4.2.1 Observations of Noise Spectra

     Noise in electronics is attributed to the random movement of carriers and
     most types of noise have a power spectral density that is flat with respect to
     frequency. Such noise is called white noise and if it is filtered, lowpass filtered
     or bandpass filtered, it is called additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
     as the noise then has an asumed Gaussian statistical distribution. The best
     understood noise is thermal noise and is attributed to the random movement
     of electrons due to the random vibration of the lattice of a conducting
     material. The theory of thermal noise is based on the fluctuation-dissipation
     theorem [1] which can be used for most materials in thermal equilibrium.
     This theorem applies both to classical and quantum mechanical systems and
     describes the classical noise encountered up to several terahertz as well as
     the quantum-mechanical effects that shape noise above a few terahertz at
     room temperature or at much lower frequencies as temperature approaches
     absolute zero [2].

        The fluctuation-dissipation theorem relates thermally-induced fluctua-
     tions in a material to the resistance of the material. The physical origin of
     thermal noise is the net effect of the rapidly-fluctuating currents resulting
     from thermal fluctuations of free electrons in a resistive (or conductive) ma-
     terial. The fluctuations of the electrons result from the vibrations of the atoms
     in a material's lattice. These vibrations relate directly to temperature and
     temperature is regarded as a direct measure of the state of entropy or ran-
     dom vibration of the lattice. So the fluctuation-dissipation theorem describes
     how vibration (i.e. temperature) of the lattice induces small current fluctua-
     tions in a material and thus describes how heat energy is converted into the
     electrical energy known as Johnson noise. This is the opposite of the effect of
     resistance which converts electrical energy into heat energy when the move-
     ment of electrons (as current) causes the lattice to vibrate more. So it is not
     surprising that the noise current is directly related to resistance.

        Key results of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem are that the available
     noise power from a resistor or group of resistors is linearly proportional to
     temperature, the available noise power is independent of the resistor value,
     and that the power spectral density (in watts per hertz) is independent of
     frequency, i.e. it is white, up to a few terahertz at room temperature.

        Consider the block of resistive material in Figure 4-1(a). Lattice vibrations
     cause random movement of electrons and thus there is a myriad of tiny
     current sources. The block of resistive material has terminals and at those
     terminals a resistance can be measured. Application of the fluctuation-
     dissipation theorem determines that the net effect of the little noise-current
     sources in the material is the same as that of a current source in parallel

with the effective resistance as shown in Figure 4-1(a). The noise current
source, in(t), has statistical properties such that the available noise power
is proportional to the bandwidth over which the noise power is measured
and to the temperature of the material in kelvin. If the resistive material is at
a temperature T0, then the noise temperature of the material T0. Going one
step further, it can be imagined that the resistive material can be described by
a network of resistors as shown in Figure 4-1(b). If RS and each resistor in the
network is at the same temperature T0, then the whole network, including
RS, is equivalent both in terms of resistance and noise to a single noisy
resistance Rx, that is at T0. So the noise temperature of the resistive network
is equal to that of Rx both being T0. This is true provided that there are no
non-thermal sources of noise inside the two-port network. For example, if
there were transistors then an additional source of noise is shot noise. Then
the noise temperature looking into port 2 of the network would be greater
than the noise temperature of the source resistance at port 1.

   In Figure 4-1(c) a noisy resistance RS has an available noise power and
all of that available noise power is delivered to the load RL provided that
RL = RS. (All of the available noise power from RL will also be delivered
to RS under matched conditions.) Even if a resistor is not loaded, so RS is
on its own, there will be noise power in the resistor which will be constantly
generated and reabsorbed (through resistive heating) so that the resistor is in
thermal equilibrium.

   A noisy resistor is equivalent both electrically and from a noise perspective
to a noise-free resistor with a shunt noise current source as in Figure 4-
1(a) or equivalently as the same value of resistance with a noise voltage
source (which will be introduced latter). The noise voltage and current
sources are random and if the noise is lowpass or bandpass filtered as in
Figure 4-1(d), the resulting noise voltage vnL(t) across the noise-free load
will have Gaussian statistics. Since it is inevitable that noise will be filtered
in a circuit, e.g. there will be at least parasitic capacitances, thermal noise is
often treated as being additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as its statistical
properties will be Gaussian. This is indeed fortuitous as it is possible to
greatly simplify the treatment of noise if it can be consider to be random with
Gaussian statistics. This is exploited in the development of the mathematics
of random processes in Appendix 1.A of [3] as it applies to both noise and

     digitally modulated signals. The key result is that noise can be described in
     the frequency domain and this understanding and characterization can be
     translated to the real world, i.e. the time domain.

        As an example, it is possible to undertake a frequency domain analysis
     of the circuit shown in Figure 4-2(a) where a source RS is connected to a
     resistive attenuator and then to a noise-free load RL. As usual the matched
     resistances external to the two-port are the same here so that RS = RL. The
     network of Figure 4-2(a) can be replaced by a network of noise-free resistors
     with noise voltage sources vnS, vn1, vn2, and vn3. The noise voltage sources
     are random and independent and so are uncorrelated. Thus to evaluate the
     noise current inL in RL the powers of the individual contributions to inL
     need to be summed first. This can be shown to be identical to calculating inL
     in Figure 4-2(c) where the equivalent resistance Rx of the network is found
     and then the noise voltage source, vnx for that resistor used. Of course since
     the two-port is an attenuator Rx = RS = RL.

     4.2.2 Characterization of Thermal Noise

     While the impact of noise on RF circuits is measured and categorized in
     the frequency domain, the physical sources of noise are in the real world.
     Noise in a conductor is manifested as random fluctuations in time of voltage
     and current. While random, the noise can have different statistics depending
     on how it originates. The three major physical sources of noise affecting
     electronic circuits are thermal, shot, and flicker.

        Thermal noise is more formally known as Johnson-Nyquist noise and
     is also referred to as Johnson noise or Nyquist noise. The noise is due to
     random fluctuations of charge carriers inside a conductor occurring with
     or without applied voltage or current. A resistor at room temperature (290-
     298 K or 19-25C) has an available noise power of -174 dBm in 1 hertz of
     bandwidth. The noise is uncorrelated so that the noise power in a second
     hertz of bandwidth will add. So in 2 hertz of bandwidth the available noise
     power is (-174 + 3) dBm = -171 dBm.

        The extent of fluctuation is linearly proportional to absolute temperature.
     Also the noise power generated is independent of the resistance of the
     conductor. The original derivation of thermal noise is due to Nyquist [4],
     who showed that the power spectral density (PSD) of the available noise
     power from a resistor (of any value) is

                                 St(f ) = kT,                                              (4.1)
NOISE, DISTORTION, AND DYNAMIC RANGE                                                          127

where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in kelvin. The
subscript t here is used to indicate thermal noise. The SI units of St are watts
per hertz but is more commonly expressed as dBm per hertz. The available
noise power in a bandwidth B is (in units of watts)

             Pt(f ) = kT B.                                        (4.2)

   When quantum effects are important, Equation (4.1) is modified and the
thermal noise PSD is

                          hf      e                                (4.3)
          St(f ) = hf/kT ,
                                        -1

where h is Plank's constant. In Equation (4.3) hf is the energy of a photon
of frequency f and kT is the average thermal energy (i.e. vibrational
kinetic energy) of the material. To determine the frequency at which the
simpler form of St can be used consider the following. At low to moderate
frequencies Equation (4.3) can be expanded as

St(f ) =     hf                              1 kT .                (4.4)

          1 + (hf /kT ) + 2 (hf /kT ) + . . . - 1 1 + 2 (hf /kT )12

Thus the thermal noise power available will drop off as frequency increases,
and is at one-half its low-frequency value at a critical frequency fc = 2kT /h.
At room temperature this is approximately 12 THz. So quantum effects on
thermal noise are not of concern at room temperature at frequencies below a
few terahertz.

   Extensive modern treatments of thermal noise are available in [5] and [6].

EXAMPLE 4.1 Available Noise Power

What is the available noise power from a resistor in a 50 MHz bandwidth and at 20C.

Solution:
The PSD is, from Equation (4.1),

          St(f ) = (1.381 · 10-23 J/K) · ((273 + 20) K)

          = 4.046 · 10-21 J = 4.046 zJ = 4.046 zW/Hz = -173.9 dBm/Hz.                (4.5)

That is, 4.046 zJ (zepto joules). The thermal noise at room temperature is usually taken as
-174 dBm/Hz. This noise power is equally divided between amplitude noise and phase
noise (each is -177 dBm/Hz) [7]. St(f ) is multiplied by the bandwidth to obtain the total
available thermal noise power, so for a 50 MHz bandwidth, the thermal noise power is

          Pt(f ) = (4.046 · 10-21 J) × (50 · 106 Hz)                                 (4.6)
                  = 2.023 · 10-13 J · s-1 = 202.3 fW = -100.1 dBm.

This is an appreciable power given that cell phones can operate with receive signals smaller
than -90 dBm. So the lesson here is to use the smallest bandwidth possible in designs.

            4.2.3 Environmental Noise

            Noise in RF and microwave systems includes noise from the environment
            as well as noise generated within the circuitry itself. Noise from the
            environment can have galactic origins, when it is known as cosmic
            background noise, from black-body radiation, or can be artificially generated
            noise. In cellular communication systems the major source of interference is
            from other phones and base stations in the cellular system. Provided this
            is uniformly random over the communication band, it can be treated as
            random noise. Uniformly random noise (i.e., white noise) can be modeled
            by a resistor held at what is called the noise temperature.

               A noisy resistor generates white noise that has a flat PSD, i.e. noise spectral
            density is independent of frequency. A noisy resistor can be modeled by a
            noise-free resistor and a random voltage or current source denoted by vn
            and in, respectively (see Figure 4-3). The sources vn and in are random and
            their spectral densities, Svn and Sin respectively, are related by

                                                     Svn(f ) = R2Sin(f ).               (4.7)

            The noise voltage spectral density of a resistor R at temperature T is [8]

                     S v vn(f ) = n2 = 4kT R,                                           (4.8)
                                  B                                                     (4.9)

            so that                  2  =  4kT  BR.

                                   vn

            Here k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvins, and B is
            the bandwidth in hertz.

               It is possible for the noise temperature looking into a two-port to be
            less than the ambient temperature and then the effective noise temperature
            of the structure is used as a measure of available noise power. A typical
            situation is specifying the noise presented by an antenna to a receiver.
            The noise captured by an antenna is from the environment with usually
            only a small portion of the noise coming from the antenna itself. In the
            absence of antenna loss, an antenna pointed into space will have a noise
            temperature corresponding to the cosmic microwave background radiation
            with an effective noise temperature of about 3 K.

               Two noise voltage sources, vn1 and vn2, in series can be partly correlated.
            Then the two noise sources can be replaced by a single source vn, where

                                           vn = vn1 + vn2 + 2Cn1,n2vn1vn2.222           (4.10)

            Here Cn1,n2 is the correlation coefficient, and -1  Cn1,n2  1. If the sources
            are uncorrelated, as they would be for two resistors, Cn1,n2 = 0 and

                                                            2  =    2  +  vn2 2 .       (4.11)

                                                          vn      vn1

Correlation of noise sources is important to modeling noise in transistors, as
there can be a common physical origin for noise that is modeled as two noise
sources in a circuit model.

4.2.4 Thermal Noise and Capacitors

Thermal noise is also seen with reactive components such as a capacitor
where it is known as kT /C (read as k-T-C) noise. The series resistance, R,
of a capacitor, C, contributes the thermal noise but the RC combination also
filters the noise. This noise can be treated the same way as the thermal
noise analysis above, but there is a short-hand way of looking at the
noise. Sarpeshkar et al. [9] showed that the mean-square noise voltage on
a capacitor of value C within the noise bandwidth of the RC circuit (derived
as 1/(4RC) in hertz) is

 2 kT                                 (4.12)
v¯n = .

        C

At room temperature (i.e., T = 20C = 293 K), the root mean square noise

voltage, v¯n2 , on a 10 pF capacitor with a 1  series resistance is 20 µV in a
25 GHz bandwidth.

4.2.5 Physical Source of Shot Noise

Shot noise is due to current being carried by discrete charge carriers. It is
important when there is a region that is scarce of free carriers. Shot noise is
particularly important with semiconductor devices but was first observed by
Schottky in 1926 in vacuum tubes. In a semiconductor the charge carriers,
electrons and holes, are discrete and independent. As such the current
fluctuates as the number of carriers varies in discrete steps. On average
there is a net velocity of carriers passing a point per time interval. For shot
noise to be observed above thermal noise, the carriers should be constrained
to pass in just one direction. This is the situation in many semiconductor
devices where the depletion region formed at the interface of pn junctions
forces the current to flow in just one direction. Shot noise is more significant
when the number of charge carriers is small, a situation that also exists
in semiconductors. However, even in a semiconductor, there are enough
carriers for shot noise to have a Gaussian distribution so that statistically
it looks like thermal noise [10]. The shorter the critical time scale, and for
microwave and RF circuits this is the period of the waveform, the fewer
the number of carriers that will pass a point and the greater the fractional
contributions of fluctuations in carrier numbers.

   The RMS current fluctuation due to shot noise is

                                      (4.13)
i = 2eIB,

where e is the elementary charge, B is the bandwidth in hertz, and I is the
current. For a DC current of 1 mA and in a 1 Hz bandwidth, the RMS current
fluctuation due to shot noise is i = 18 pA. If this current flows through a
resistance R, the spectral noise density in the resistor is

Ps = 2e|I|.                           (4.14)

                   Note that Ps is independent of temperature and frequency, although
                   eventually quantum effects become important [11]. In contrast, thermal
                   noise is proportional to temperature. The current in Equation (4.14) is the
                   instantaneous current. So shot noise varies during an RF cycle as the current
                   flow varies. If the DC current is much larger than the time-varying current,
                   then the noise that is created by the separable pulses has a flat frequency
                   spectrum and can be modeled by a white noise source.

                      So the lesson here is that in active circuit designs, bias currents should
                   be minimized. Also note that the noise power is a function of the resistance
                   value but active circuits with high resistance values also tend to have low
                   current levels.

                   4.2.6 Physical Source of Flicker Noise

                   The third type of noise that is of concern with RF and microwave circuits
                   is flicker noise, sometimes called 1/f (one-over-f) noise because of its
                   power spectral density shape. Flicker noise is due to diffusion, traps in a
                   semiconductor, and surface traps. A free carrier is immobilized or trapped
                   when it falls into a trap, that is, a recombination center. When several such
                   carriers are trapped, it means that they are not available for conduction
                   and as a result, the resistance of the semiconductor is modulated. These
                   fluctuations have multiple relaxation times. Flicker noise is considered again
                   in Section 6.4 in regards to the characterization of local oscillator modules. A
                   complete physical understanding of flicker noise is not available, and flicker
                   noise is a major concern with oscillators.

                   4.3 Noise Characterization

                   Amplifiers, filters, and mixers in an RF front end process (e.g., amplify, filter,
                   and mix) input noise the same way as an input signal. In addition, these
                   components contribute excess noise of their own. Without loss of generality,
                   the following discussion considers noise with respect to the amplifier shown
                   in Figure 4-4(a), where vs is the input signal. The development here applies
                   only to white noise (i.e., thermal and shot noise). The noise signal, with
                   source designated by vn, is uncorrelated and random, and described as an
                   RMS voltage or by its noise power.

                      The most important noise-related metric is the SNR. Denoting the noise
                   power input to the amplifier as Ni, and denoting the signal power input to
                   the amplifier as Si, the input signal-to-noise power ratio is SNRi = Si/Ni.
                   If the amplifier is noise free, then the input noise and signal powers are
                   amplified by the power gain of the amplifier, G. Thus the output noise power
                   is No = GNi, the output signal power is So = GSi, and the output SNR is
                   SNRo = So/No = SNRi.

                      In practice, an amplifier is noisy, with the addition of excess noise,
NOISE, DISTORTION, AND DYNAMIC RANGE                                             131

Ne, indicated in Figure 4-4(b). The excess noise originates in different

components in the amplifier and is either referenced to the input or to the

output of the amplifier. Most commonly it is referenced to the output so that

the total output noise power is No = GNi + Ne. In the absence of a qualifier,

the excess noise should be assumed to be referred to the output. Ne is not

measured directly. Instead, the ratio of the SNR at the input to that at the

output is the noise factor:

                             F = SNRi ,           (4.15)
                                   SNRo

and this is the way noise performance is normally measured. If the circuit is
noise free, then SNRo = SNRi and F = 1. If the circuit is not noise free, then
SNRo < SNRi and F > 1. F can be related to the excess noise produced in
the circuit. With the excess noise, Ne, referred to the circuit output,

F = SNRi = SNRi 1 = Si No = Si GNi + Ne
SNRo                         1 SNRo Ni So Ni GSi

= 1 + Ne .                                        (4.16)
        GNi

One of the conclusions that can be drawn from this is that the noise factor,
F , depends on the available noise power at the input of the circuit. As a
standard reference, the available noise power, NR, from a resistor at standard
temperature, T0 (290 K) [12], and over a bandwidth, B (in Hz), is used,

                             Ni = NR = kT0B,      (4.17)

where k (= 1.381 × 10-23 J/K) is the Boltzmann constant. If the input of an
amplifier is connected to this resistor and all of the noise power is delivered
to the amplifier, then

      F = 1 + Ne = 1 + Ne .                       (4.18)
                             GNi         GkT0B

   Several random physical processes inside a circuit contribute to excess
noise, and not all of these processes vary linearly with temperature.
Consequently F is a function of temperature, although usually a weak
one. It is also a function of bandwidth, and there is a problem in using F
with cascaded systems in which bandwidths vary for different subsystems.
Even with all these problems, F is the most important measure used
to characterize noise performance. It can be used to determine the noise
performance of a cascade, when the noise factors and gains of the subsystem
constituents are known. F is the ratio of powers, and when expressed in
decibels, the noise figure (NF) is used:

      NF = 10 log10 F                             (4.19)
           = SNRi|dB - SNRo|dB ,

where the SNR is expressed in decibels.
   Consider the amplifier in Figure 4-4. If the excess noise contribution of an

amplifier is ignored, the output noise power will be

                             No = GkT0B.          (4.20)
132                                      STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     With the amplifier's excess noise, Ne, included, the output noise power is

                         No = GkT0B + Ne = GkT0B(1 + Ne/(GkT0B))                                      (4.21)
                             = F GkT0B.

     Rearranging this equation, the excess noise power can be written as

                                              Ne = (F - 1)GkT0B.                                      (4.22)

        The output noise of a system can be expressed in terms of its noise figure.
     From Equation (4.18), the output noise is

     That is,                 No = GNi + Ne = F GNi.                                            (4.23)
                         No|dBm = NF + G|dB + Ni|dBm                                          . (4.24)

                       So if the input noise of an amplifier with a gain of 20 dB and a noise
                       figure of 3 dB is -90 dBm, then the noise at the output of the amplifier is
                       -67 dBm. This analysis of output noise is only correct if the input source is
                       the equivalent of a resistor held at standard temperature, T0. So the analysis
                       would not apply if the input to the system was an antenna pointed into the
                       sky (away from cosmic objects such as the sun and moon) which would have
                       a noise temperature of 4 K (due to the cosmic background radiation) plus
                       antenna and cable noise.

EXAMPLE 4.2 Effective Noise Temperature

     An antenna with a noise temperature of 50 K is connected to an amplifier with a bandwidth
     of 20 MHz, a noise figure of 3 dB, and a gain of 10 dB. What is the effective noise temperature
     at the output of the amplifier?

     Solution:

     The output effective noise temperature, Teff , is the temperature of a resistor that would
     produce the same available noise power, No, as the output available noise power of the
     amplifier. The amplifier adds excess noise, Ne, to the input noise, Ni, that is amplified by
     the amplifier. So to determine No, Ne must be determined first. This is obtained from the
     noise figure, NF, which is defined in terms of noise power of a resistor at the input with a
     temperature of T0 = 290 K.

     The noise factor F = 10NF = 1.995 and from Equation (4.22)

     Ne = (F - 1)GkT0B = (1.995 - 1) · 1010/10 · (1.3807 ·-23 J/K) · (290 K) · (20 · 106 Hz)

     = 7.969 · 10-13 W.                                                                 (4.25)

     The input noise of a resistor at 50 K is                                           (4.26)
             Ni = kT B = (1.3807 ·-23 J/K) · (50 K) · (20 · 106 Hz) = 1.381 · 10-14 W.

     So the total output noise power is

     No = GNi + Ne = 1010/10 · 1.381 · 10-14 + 7.969 · 10-13 = 9.350 · 10-13 W.         (4.27)

     Thus the effective noise temperature at the output of the amplifier is

     Teff = No =                         9.350 · 10-13 W     = 3386 K.                  (4.28)

EXAMPLE 4.3 Noise Figure of an Attenuator

What is the noise figure of a 20 dB attenuator in a 50  system?

Solution:

Denoting the attenuator as being in a 50  system indicates that an appropriate circuit
model to use in the analysis consists of the attenuator driven by a generator with a 50 
source impedance, and the attenuator drives a 50  load. Also, the input impedance of the
terminated attenuator is 50 , as is the impedance looking into the output of the attenuator
when it is connected to the source. The key point is that the noise coming from the source
is the noise thermally generated in the 50  source impedance, and this noise is equal to the
noise that is delivered to the load, as the impedance presented to the load is also 50 . So the
input noise, Ni, is equal to the output noise:

                         No = Ni.                                                 (4.29)

The input signal is attenuated by 20 dB (= 100), so

                         So = Si/100,                                             (4.30)

and thus the noise factor is                                                      (4.31)
                                 F = SN Ri = Si No = Si Ni = 100
                                        SN Ro Ni So Ni Si/100

and the noise figure is

                         NF = 20 dB.                                              (4.32)

THus the noise figure of an attenuator (or a filter) is just the loss of the component. This is not
true for amplifiers of course, as there are other sources of noise, and the output impedance
of a transistor is not a thermal resistance.

4.3.1 Noise in a Cascaded System

Section 4.3 developed the noise factor and noise figure measures for a two-
port. This result can be generalized for a system. Considering the second
stage of the cascade in Figure 4-5, the excess noise at the output of the second
stage, due solely to the noise generated internally in the second stage, is

N2e = (F2 - 1)kT0BG2.                                               (4.33)

Then the total noise power at the output of a two-stage cascade is

N2o = (F2 - 1)kT0BG2 + No,1G2                                       (4.34)
     = (F2 - 1)kT0BG2 + F1kT0BG1G2.

This relies on the reasonable assumption that the excess noise added in one
stage is uncorrelated to the excess noise from other stages as well as being
uncorrelated to the input noise. Thus powers can be added. The second term

                         ports.
134                                STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

                         in Equation (4.34) is the noise output from the first stage amplified by the
                         second stage with gain G2.

                            Generalizing the above result yields the total noise power at the output of
                         the mth stage:

                                                                 n             m

                                   m

                                                                               
                                   Nmo = (Fn - 1) kT0B Gj + F1kT0B Gn.                             (4.35)

                                   n=2                       j=2               n=1

                         Thus an m-stage cascade has a total cascaded system noise factor of F T =
                         NmoGTN1i, with GT being the total cascaded available gain and N1i
                         being the noise power input to the first stage. In terms of the parameters

                         of individual stages, the total system noise factor is

                                   F T = F1 + F2 - 1 + F3 - 1 + F4 - 1 + · · · ,                   (4.36)

EXAMPLE 4.4 Noise Figure of Cascaded Stages

     Consider the cascade of a differential amplifier and a filter shown in Figure 4-6.

     (a) What is the midband gain of the filter in decibels? Note that IL is insertion loss.
     (b) What is the midband noise figure of the filter?
     (c) The amplifier has a gain G1 = 20 dB and a noise figure of 2 dB. What is the overall gain

          of the cascade system in the middle of the band? Express your answer in decibels.
     (d) What is the noise factor of the cascade system?
     (e) What is the noise figure of the cascade system?

     Solution:

     (a) G2 = 1/IL, thus G2 = -3 dB.
     (b) For a passive element, NF2 = IL = 3 dB.
     (c) G1 = 20 dB and G2 = -3 dB, so GTOTAL = G1|dB + G2|dB = 17 dB.
     (d) F1 = 10NF1/10 = 102/10 = 1.585, F2 = 10NF2/10 = 103/10 = 1.995, G1 = 1020/10 = 100,

          and G2 = 10-3/10 = 0.5. Using Friis's formula

                         FTOTAL = F1 + F2 - 1 = 1.585 + 1.995 - 1 = 1.594.          (4.38)

EXAMPLE 4.5 Noise Figure of a Two-Stage Amplifier

Consider a room-temperature (20C) two-stage amplifier where the first stage has a gain of
10 dB and the second stage has a gain of 20 dB. The noise figure of the first stage is 3 dB and
the second stage is 6 dB. The amplifier has a bandwidth of 10 MHz.

(a) What is the noise power presented to the amplifier in 10 MHz?
(b) What is the total gain of the amplifier?
(c) What is the total noise factor of the amplifier?
(d) What is the total noise figure of the amplifier?
(e) What is the noise power at the output of the amplifier in 10 MHz?

Solution:

(a) Noise power of a resistor at room temperature is -174 dBm/Hz (or more precisely

-173.86 dBm/Hz at 293 K). In 10 MHz the input noise power is

Ni = -173.86 dBm + 10 log(107) = -173.86 + 70 dBm = -103.86 dBm.

(b) Total gain GT = G1G2 = 10 dB + 20 dB = 30 dB = 1000.

(c) F1 = 10NF1/10 = 103/10 = 1.995, F2 = 10NF2/10 = 106/10 = 3.981. Using Friis's formula,

the total noise figure is F T = F1 + F2 - 1 = 1.995 + 3.981 - 1 = 2.393.
                     G1                            10
(d) The total noise figure is NFT = 10 log10(FT) = 10 log10(2.393) = 3.79 dB.
(e) Output noise power in 10 MHz bandwidth is No = F TkT0BGT = (2.393) · (1.3807 ·

10-23 · J · K-1) · (293 K) · (107 · s-1)(1000) = 9.846 · 10-11 W = -70.07 dBm.

Alternatively, No|dBm = Ni|dBm + GT dB + NFT = -103.86 dBm + 30 dB + 3.79 dB =
-70.07 dBm.

4.3.2 Measurement of Noise Figure

The Y -factor method is the basis of modern microwave automatic noise
figure measurement systems. The technique involves measuring the noise
power at the output of a device under test (DUT) when two different noise
sources are attached to the input of the DUT [14]. The manual form of
the Y -factor method is used at millimeter-wave frequencies. The method
is dependent on the accuracy of gain measurement, the ability to generate
precise levels of excess noise power, and the sensitivity of noise power
measurement. Gain and noise power measurement are subtly different, with
gain generally a coherent measurement while the noise power measurement
is necessarily incoherent. In both automatic and manual systems, the
measurement setup is a cascade system in which the DUT is the first stage
and the test set is the last and usually second set. The noise contribution of
the test set is only negligible if the gain of the DUT is high.

   Under matched conditions, the available power gain of the DUT is

           G = So ,                                                    (4.39)
                 Si

so signal power can be eliminated from the expression for the noise factor by
combining Equations (4.15) and (4.39) :

           F = SNRi = Si No = No .                                     (4.40)
                 SNRo Ni So NiG

The output noise is larger than the amplified input noise because of the noise
inserted by the DUT. Denoting the component of the output noise power due
136  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     Figure 4-7: Noise figure test setup for
     determining the noise figure of a DUT.

     solely to the DUT by ND, the output noise power is

     No = NiG + ND.                                      (4.41)

        The final component of the development is noting that the input noise
     power is related to the temperature of the input match so that Ni = kT B
     where k is the Boltzmann constant and B is the measurement bandwidth.
     Conventionally F is referenced to standard temperature T0 = 290K
     (specifically the input noise temperature is T0) and so

     ND = kT0BG(F - 1).                                  (4.42)

        In the Y -factor method, two noise sources with known noise temperatures
     T1 and T2 (with T2 > T1) are applied to the input of the DUT and the
     corresponding output noise powers N1 and N2 measured (see Figure 4-7).
     In the laboratory a calibrated noise source, such as a reverse-biased diode in
     avalanche, is used to produce the noise source at T2. The other temperature,
     T1, is often obtained by turning the noise source off so that T1 = T0, the
     ambient temperature. This leads to the Y factor, which is defined as

     Y = N2/N1.                                          (4.43)

     In the off state, that is when T1 = T0, the output noise power in the off state
     is called the "off power":

     N1 = kT0BG + ND = kT0BG + kT0BG(F - 1).             (4.44)

     The second noise source, with noise temperature T2, produces calibrated
     excess noise and the noise power under these conditions is called the "on
     power ":

     N2 = kT2BG + ND = kT2BG + kT0BG(F - 1).             (4.45)

     Combining Equations (4.42)-(4.45) yields

     F = T2 - T0 .                                       (4.46)
           T0(Y - 1)

        Expressing Equation (4.47) in decibels and integrating (perhaps through
     measurement) over the system bandwidth yields the noise figure,

     NF = 10 log(F ) = ENRdB-10 log(Y - 1),              (4.47)

     where ENRdB = 10 log[(T2 - T0)/T0] is the excess noise ratio in decibels of
     the calibrated noise source.

4.3.3 Measurement of Noise Temperature

If the noise figure of an amplifier replacing the DUT is known, then the noise
temperature of a source can be determined. From Equation (4.46),

                  T2 = F T0(Y - 1) + T0.                              (4.48)

In a laboratory application the amplifier could be cryogenically cooled and
then there is negligible excess noise contribution by the amplifier so that
F  1 and T2 = Y T0F .

4.3.4 Measuring the Noise Figure of Low Noise Devices

One of the factors that affects the accuracy of noise figure determination

is noise originating in the measurement test set. This leads to an error

sometimes referred to as the second-stage contribution effect [15]. This is a

particularly important issue when measuring the noise figure of low-gain

devices, as then the noise contribution of the second stage can be significant.

One approach to minimizing this error is the insertion of a high-gain low-

noise amplifier, referred to as the instrumentation amplifier, between the

DUT and the test set. The noise figure of the instrumentation amplifier

should be known precisely if the error it introduces is to be removed from

the raw noise figure measurement.

The Y -factor method relies on the instrumentation amplifier having a

much lower noise figure than the DUT. When this cannot be achieved,

the best that can be done is to use two (almost) identical amplifiers with

the same gain and noise characteristics. The extended Y -factor technique

described in this section utilizes two DUTs in a two-stage cascade first with

one arrangement of the DUTs and then with the reverse cascade [16]. The

technique makes use of the cascaded noise factor operation twice. Figure 4-8

illustrates the test setup with the two possible arrangements of the cascaded

DUTs. In Figure 4-8 the power meter is configured to measure noise power

(normalized to a 1 Hz bandwidth).

The individual noise factors of the DUTs for a cascaded system with DUT

A followed by DUT B, the forward cascade, are denoted by F1A and F2B,

and those for the reverse cascade with DUT B followed by DUT A are F1B

and F2A. The corresponding gains of the stages are G1A, G2B for the forward

cascade, and G1B, G2A for the reverse cascade. Here the first subscript refers

to the position in the cascade (either first or second stage), and the second

subscript identifies the particular DUT (either A or B). Finally, the total noise

factors  of  the  two-cascaded  systems  are  denoted  FT   and  FT   according  to

                                                         A         B

                                           FA

              and for the reverse cascade

                                              T  =  F1B    +    (F2A  -  1)/G1B .                 (4.50)

                                           FB

                 The technique presumes that the parameters of the DUTs are invariant of
              their position in the cascade so that F1A = F2A = FA and F1B = F2B = FB as
              well as G1A = G2A = GA and G1B = G2B = GB. Equations (4.49) and (4.50)
              can now be solved simultaneously for the unknown noise factors of the two
              stages:

                      FB =       T   GA  GB  -GA    (1  -  FAT)  -  1  /(GAGB )                   (4.51)
                                                                                                  (4.52)
                              FB

              and FA = FATGA-FB + 1 /(GA)

              from the measured FAT, FBT, GA, and GB. So with the gains of the two

              stages measured independently, the noise factors of the two stages can be

              determined from the measured noise factors of the forward and reverse

              cascades.

              In the special situation of matched DUTs where the noise and gain of the

              two stages are identical (so that FA = FB = F and GA = GB = F ) and
              FT      FT      F T,
                   =       =         then  the   calculations    simplify  to  yield  the  noise  factor  of
                A       B

              each stage:

                                                               GF T                               (4.53)
                                                        F= 2 .

                                                              G +1

                 One of the assumptions of the extended Y -factor method is that the gain
              and noise of the stages are invariant with respect to the order of the stages in
              the cascade. Any departure will result in an error. A technique that reduces
              the sensitivity to placement is to use small attenuators at the inputs and
              outputs of the stages. The noise contributions can then be removed from the
              final measured result.

              4.3.5 Radiometer System

              A radiometer, as shown in Figure 4-9(a), measures the power in EM radiation
              predominantly at microwave frequencies and most commonly measures
              noise. Radiometers are used in remote sensing and radio astronomy,

especially by satellites and aircraft. Understanding the physical process that
creates uncorrelated radiation at different frequencies enables vegetation,
air and sea temperatures, ice coverage, ocean salinity, and other surface
and atmospheric sources to be identified from the spectrum captured by
a radiometer. Radiometers monitor discrete windows of the spectrum,
particularly at frequencies corresponding to molecular resonances. A
radiometer includes a mechanism for rapid calibration, such as a Dicke
switch, quickly switching between the object being observed and another
object serving as a calibrated noise source. In aircraft and on land, the
calibration sources are resistors, often held at low temperatures. A satellite-
based radiometer is shown in Figure 4-9(b), and instead of a Dicke switch, the
calibration is obtained by switching the antenna beam between the observed
region (Beam A) and an empty area of space (Beam B). With a Dicke switch
or antenna beam switching, it is possible to achieve better than 0.01 K of
resolution.

4.3.6 Noise Figure of a Two-Port Amplifier

The parameters that define the noise figure of two-port amplifiers were
set forth by Haus et al. [12] in 1960 and are used by microwave transistor
manufacturers in their datasheets. The amplifier model used in noise factor
computation is shown in Figure 4-10.

   Figure 4-10 has the active device or amplifier, which is noisy, represented
as a two-port with a Norton equivalent source, which will have its own noise,
and a load. The noisy active device or amplifier can be replaced by a noiseless
two-port with a voltage noise source, en, and a current noise source, in, at the
front of the two-port. Any linear noisy two-port can be represented by a noise
free two-port with noise sources. With an active device or amplifier there
will be many internal noise sources but it is the noise sources at the input,
prior to gain, which are most significant. For an active device or amplifier
the voltage and current sources will be at least partially correlated and so the
source admittance is important in determining how they combine. A worst
case would be when they combine to present the maximum possible noise
at the input of the active device or amplifier. It is also possible to adjust the
source admittance so that the noise sources combine to present the minimum
noise to the active device or amplifier. This effect is captured in the noise
140              STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     factor of the amplifier in Figure 4-10. The noise factor of this amplifier is [12]

                 F = Fmin + rn ys - yopt 2 ,                         (4.54)
                                 gs

     where rn = (Rn/Z0) is called the equivalent noise resistance of the two-port

     and Fmin is the minimum noise factor obtained by adjusting tuners at the

     input of the amplifier to present all possible values of YS to the input of the

     amplifier. The normalized admittance presented by the tuners at Fmin is yopt.

     With ys(= YS /Z0) and gs = {ys} being the actual normalized admittance

     and conductance, respectively, Equation (4.54) enables the noise factor to be

     calculated for an actual design. The parameters in Equation (4.54) describe

     the effect of internal amplifier noise sources and how they are correlated.

     More commonly the noise parameters are reported in terms of reflection

     coefficients rather than admittance. The source reflection coefficient, s,

     comes from              ys = 1 - s
                                    1 + s
                                                                     (4.55)

     and the optimum source reflection coefficient, opt, comes from

                 yopt = 1 - opt .                                    (4.56)
                          1 + opt

     Substituting these into Equation (4.54) results in

                 F = Fmin +  4rn s - opt 2
                                                      2.             (4.57)
                             1 - |s|2      1 + opt

     Together Fmin, rn, and opt are called the noise parameters of a device and
     must be measured. The noise parameters of a pHEMT transistor are given in
     Table 4-1.

        In general, the design for best noise performance does not yield the best
     gain. The reduction in gain is usually small however. Designing the input
     and output matching networks of an amplifier to be conjugately matched
     yields maximum amplifier gain. For best noise performance, however, the
     input matching network is not conjugately matched and instead the input
     reflection coefficient looking into the matching network from the active
     device is opt. As a result, maximum gain is not obtained. The interpretation
     of why this is necessary is that a particular mismatch minimizes the
     combined noise contributions of partially correlated internal active device
     noise sources. In modern RF and microwave design, however, if noise
     performance is of concern, two or more amplifier stages are used, with the
     first stage designed for optimum noise performance and subsequent stages
     designed to obtain the required gain.

4.4 Oscillator Noise

Noise on oscillators has a particular characteristic that affects the use of
oscillators in RF systems. When oscillating, the frequency of oscillation varies
slightly and this variation is captured as phase noise.

4.4.1 Observations of Noise Spectra of Oscillators

In the frequency domain, noise is characterized by its power spectral density,
S, which is the noise power in a specified bandwidth. It is typical to use 1 Hz
as the reference bandwidth and then S is expressed in units of watts per hertz
or, more commonly, as dBm per hertz. Some types of noise are proportional
to the RF signal or carrier level and are expressed relative to the level of the
carrier as dBc/Hz (10 log of the ratio of the noise power per hertz relative to
the power of the carrier). Noise can be decomposed into a phase component,
S, and an amplitude component, Sa. Then the observed phase fluctuations,
as classified in [18], are as shown in Figure 4-11. There are also amplitude
fluctuations that have a similar characteristic. For example, flicker amplitude
noise will also have an f -1 dependence. However, the phase component
generated by electronic circuits gets the most attention as small amplitude
variations are quenched by device nonlinearities. In Figure 4-11, the log of

142  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     the phase noise power spectral density relative to a reference level is plotted
     as a function of the log of frequency. The graph does not go all the way down
     to DC because the frequency axis is logarithmic. This does not imply that
     the noise power goes to infinity1 as, of course, the bandwidth is becoming
     smaller and smaller at low log(f ).

        Figure 4-11 is the usual way to plot noise, as straight-line regions are
     clearly observed experimentally and in these regions the noise power
     spectral density varies with frequency as 1/f n, where n is a positive
     integer. Sometimes one or more of these regions will be missing, and this
     is interpreted as the crossover frequencies, the fc,-ns in Figure 4-11, being
     out of order.

        The observed noise characteristic (Figure 4-11) is intriguing. Why are there
     straight line regions and what are the physical processes that produce noise
     with such characteristics? The straight-line regions are in contrast to what
     could, perhaps, be expected to be a smooth continuous transition from a low
     spectral density region to a high spectral density region.

        Names have been given to the regions [18], with the first being white phase
     noise, noise with no frequency dependence (i.e., a frequency dependence
     of f 0). This noise has a mean and a variance but no higher (i.e., third and
     above) moment. In the time domain this noise has (actually assumed to
     have) a Gaussian distribution. This is the form of noise that can be translated
     between the time and frequency domains using integer calculus.

        The next noise region seen in Figure 4-11 is called the flicker phase noise
     region with noise spectral density dependent on 1/f (or f -1). Traditionally
     this has been a puzzling noise characteristic and is possibly due to chaotic
     behavior. The 1/f characteristic indicates that there is long-term memory,
     which is the same as saying that fluctuations (i.e., noise) are correlated to
     fluctuations at past times. In RF and microwave systems, flicker phase noise
     is often the most significant noise and sets the noise-related performance
     limits receiver circuits in particular. Energy consumption is also affected
     as flicker noise is usually suppressed by increasing oscillator bias currents.
     Following the 1/f region are the white frequency, f -2, flicker frequency, f -3,
     and random walk frequency regions, f -4. These regions also indicate long-
     term correlation of fluctuations. It has been shown that at least some of the
     noise in the f -2 region is die to up-converted white noise from near DC [22]
     and from white noise near harmonics of the oscillating signal [23].

        At RF the noise of greatest interest is the noise superimposed on a signal
     that is amplified, or the noise that is generated by an oscillator. This noise
     has a white noise component and one or more components with 1/(f )n
     dependence, where n is a positive integer and f is the offset from the center
     signal frequency. The noise with 1/(f )n dependence has been found to

     1 More importantly, the integration, using integer calculus, is not valid. The noise that
       has the 1/f -like spectrum is believed to be fractal (i.e., of chaotic origin). Fractals are
       formally irregular, rough, and nondifferentiable. That is, fractal processes are inaccessible to
       treatment by integer calculus and thus they do not have a power spectrum [19]. However,
       it has been shown that such a process when passed through an ideal bandpass filter will
       become stationary and then have a power spectrum [20, 21]. What this means is that since
       measurement equipment is band limited, the measured spectrum may appear to approach
       infinity as the offset goes to zero, but the underlying physical noise process will not. As well,
       the real bandpass filter of measurement equipment has loss and so a measurement artifact is
       that noise measurements will level off for smaller and smaller frequency offsets.

be at least partly related to the noise observed at low frequencies. (This is
another indication of our lack of a full understanding of noise.)

   The phase noise observed on the signal produced by an oscillator is
shown in Figure 4-12(a). While the noise appears both above and below
the oscillating frequency, so-called double-sideband noise, usually only the
upper sideband is plotted, as shown in Figure 4-12(b). The designations
of the straight-line regions [18] (see Figure 4-12(b)) correspond to the
designations for low-frequency noise (see Figure 4-11). The noise observed
on an oscillation signal or on the signal at the output of an amplifier must,
necessarily, come from processing of a physical noise source.

   The noise on the signal at the output of an oscillator is almost entirely
phase fluctuations, as saturation quenches amplitude fluctuations. Phase
fluctuations in the frequency domain are characterized by spectral density
of the phase fluctuations. If the signal at the output of the oscillator is

v(t) = [V0 + (t)] sin [2f0t + (t)] ,                  (4.58)

where (t) is the amplitude fluctuation and (t) is the phase fluctuation, the
spectral density of phase fluctuations is

                                              E 2(t)  (4.59)
S(f ) = S() = PSD [(t)] = B ,

where f = /(2) is the frequency offset from the carrier at frequency f0,
PSD refers to power spectral density, E[ ] refers to the estimated value (here
the mean of the squared phase), and B is the bandwidth over which the

estimate is made (i.e., the bandwidth of the measurement). With bandwidth
having the units of hertz, then the units of S are radians2/Hz. Equation (4.59)
includes contributions from both the upper and lower sidebands and so it

is a double-sideband measure of phase noise. The preferred measure is the
single-sideband phase noise spectral density L (read as script-L) so that2

L(f ) = 12 S(f ).                                     (4.60)

2 In the past, L(f ) was defined as the single-sideband noise power in a 1 Hz bandwidth divided
  by the carrier power. This definition has been superseded by Equation (4.60) because of
  ambiguities in applying the old definition when both amplitude and phase fluctuations are
  significant.

     4.5 Nonlinear Distortion

     Distortion imposes a fundamental limit to the efficiency that can be realized
     in an RF system [24-27]. There must be enough DC power to ensure that
     signals are processed with no more than the maximum acceptable distortion.
     Nonlinear distortion originates when the output signal from an amplifier, for
     example, approaches the extremes of the load line so that the output is not
     an exact amplified replication of the input signal.

     4.5.1 Amplitude and Phase Distortion

     For a one-tone signal, the amplitude gain of the signal rolls off as the
     input power increases, as shown in Figure 4-13(a). This figure plots the
     power of the output sinewave against the power of the input sinewave. The
     plot is called the AM-to-AM (AM-AM) response (the amplitude-dependent
     amplitude response) of the amplifier. The AM-AM characteristic is linear
     at low input powers, but eventually the gain reduces (compresses) and the
     output power drops below the linear extension of the small-signal response.
     In Figure 4-13(a), the 1 dB gain compression point is the point where the
     difference between the extrapolated linear response exceeds the actual gain
     by 1 dB. P1dB is the output power at the 1 dB gain compression point and is
     the single most important metric of distortion, and amplifier designers use
     P1dB as a point of reference.

        A gain compression of 1 dB corresponds to a signal voltage amplitude
     reduction of 11% so P1dB indicates a small but significant reduction in
     the linear gain of an amplifier. For high orders of modulation this 11%
     error could mean that the sampled received signal does not match the
     actual transmitted constellation point. The range of power of a modulated
     input signal is usually chosen so that the peak power of the envelope is
     equal to or less than the 1 dB gain compression power. Thus for nearly all
     modulation formats (a notable exception is FM) the average signal power
     is backed-off from the 1 dB gain compression power by the peak-to-mean
     envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of the modulated signal. With higher-order
     modulation having a higher PMEPR a greater back-off is required.

        At large powers, the parasitic capacitances of the transistors in the
     amplifier vary the phase of the output signal, and hence phase distortion
     occurs. Figure 4-13(b) shows what is called the AM-to-PM (AM-PM)
     characteristic which is a measure of the amplitude-dependent phase
     distortion. For a digitally modulated signal, phase distortion would be

significant if it caused the wrong constellation point to be selected in a
receiver. So for 8-PSK modulation a 22.5 phase shift would be significant,
less if noise is considered. The AM-AM distortion generally occurs before
the output phase varies appreciably. This is because the nonlinearity of
a transistor is predominantly a current-voltage nonlinearity with phase
distortion coming mostly from the nonlinearity of parasitic capacitances.

   While Figure 4-13 presents the distortion characteristics for a single
sinewave, it has proved to be a reasonable indicator of performance with
modulated signals. In particular, with the maximum peak envelope output
power being P1dB, in-band distortion is usually acceptable while maximizing
high amplifier efficiency [28].

   The AM-AM and AM-PM characterizations describe distortion with an
amplifier but they are also used with other types of nonlinear subsystems
such as mixers.

  EXAMPLE 4.6 Amplifier Back-Off

An amplifier has an output power of 10 dBm when the gain of a single tone is compressed
by 1 dB. What is the maximum output power of an undistorted QPSK signal with a PMEPR
of 3.6 dB?

Solution:

The maximum undistorted output QPSK signal is generally accepted as being when the peak
envelope power is equal to the 1 dB gain compression power. In dBm the peak envelope
power is greater than the mean signal power by the peak-to-mean envelope power ratio.
Thus the QPSK signal power is said to be backed-off from the 1 dB gain compression point
by PMEPR. Thus the maximum undistorted output power of the QPSK signal is

                Po,QPSK = P1dB|dBm - PMEPR|dB = 10 dBm - 3.6 dB = 6.4 dBm.                                  (4.61)

4.5.2 Gain Compression

The voltage vo(t) at the output of an amplifier that is biased in the middle
of the output current-voltage characteristics (i.e., a Class A amplifier) can be
modeled by the first few terms of a Taylor series

             vo(t) = ao + a1vi(t) + a2vi2(t) + a3vi3(t) + . . . ,                                   (4.62)

where vi(t) is the input voltage. In a Class A amplifier, the even-order terms
are small because distortion at the extremes of the voltage waveform are

largely symmetrical, and it is found that the coefficients of the odd-order
terms of the Taylor series rapidly decrease so that |a1|  |a3|  |a5| . . . .
Also it is found that a3 is negative. With a single sinusoidal input voltage at
frequency f1 = 1/(2), vi(t) = V1 cos(1t) and the output voltage is

vo(t)  =a0   +  a1Vi      cos(1t)  +         2  cos2(1t)  +              3    cos3(1t)  +  .  .  .

                                      a2V1                        a3Vi

       =  a0    +   12 a2Vi2  +    a1Vi  +     34 a3Vi3  cos(1t)

          +  1  a2     2  cos(21  t)  +  1  a3     3  cos(31  t)  +  .  .  .  .                     (4.63)
             2                           4
                    Vi                          Vi

RF and microwave amplifiers are used with bandpass filters and the
distortion corresponding to harmonics is easily filtered out. Thus the output,
after filtering and removing the DC component is

            vo(t) =       a1Vi  +  4 a3Vi3  3   cos(1t) = Vo cos(1t),                               (4.64)

               where Vo = a1Vi + 34 a3Vi3 is the magnitude of the voltage at the input
               frequency. So the voltage gain is

                                 Vi

               and the power gain (assuming the input and output impedances are the

               same) is          G = VG2.                        (4.66)

               Since a3 is negative, the gain for very low input voltages, small V1, is linear
               with VG = a1 and the gain reduces for larger input signals, resulting in
               the gain compression, the reduction in the slope of Pout versus Pin, seen in
               Figure 4-13(a). For other amplifiers, and particularly for switching amplifiers,
               many more terms must be considered in the power series expansion, and
               it is possible that the gain could increase before dropping and eventually
               saturating. This temporary increase in gain is called gain expansion.

               4.5.3 Intermodulation Distortion

               A two-tone signal consisting of two sinusoidal signals is a better
               representation of system performance with modulated signals. A signal
               that is the linear combination of two sinusoidal signals of equal amplitude
               is shown in Figure 4-14(a). When this signal is large and is input to an
               amplifier in what is called a two-tone test, the extremes of the output signal
               are compressed. This results in the saturated output waveform shown in
               Figure 4-14(b), where the dashed curve is the undistorted waveform. In
               the frequency domain this distortion produces additional tones so that this
               distortion is said to produce intermodulation products (IMPs), as shown
               in Figure 4-15. Here the f1 and f2 components have the frequencies of the
               original two-tone input signal. The extra tones in the output, f3 and f4, are
               the intermodulation tones. The tone at f3 = 2f1 - f2 is known as the lower
               IM3 (or lower third-order intermod) tone and the tone at f4 = 2f2 - f1 is
               known as the upper IM3 tone.
NOISE, DISTORTION, AND DYNAMIC RANGE                                                                           147

   The simplest way to view intermodulation distortion is to consider a two-
tone input signal,

                                   vi(t) = Vi [cos(1t) + cos(2t)] ,                                    (4.67)

where the tones at frequencies f1 = 1/(2) and f2 = 2/(2) have equal
amplitude Vi. Substituting this signal into the Taylor series expansion in
Equation (4.62) leads to the output signal

vo(t)  =  a0  +  a1Vi      cos(1t)        +  a1Vi  cos(2t)     +   2 a2Vi1   2  [cos(1t)    +  cos(2t)]2

          + a3Vi3 [cos(1t) + cos(2t)]3 + . . .

       =  a0  +  a1Vi      cos(1t)        +  a1Vi  cos(2t)     +   12 a2Vi   2  [1  +  cos(21t)]

              a3Vi

                           2                    4                            4

The component of the output at the first fundamental is

                                             Vo,1  =  a1Vi  +   34 a3Vi3                               (4.69)
                                                                                                       (4.70)
and the component of the output at the second fundamental is                                           (4.71)

                                 Vo,2 = a1Vi + 34 a3Vi3.
Note that a1 is the linear voltage gain of the amplifier:

                                          a1 = Vo,1/Vi = Vo,2/Vi.

4.5.4 Third-Order Distortion

RF and microwave amplifiers are typically used with bandpass or lowpass
inter-stage matching networks or filters, and so the distortion corresponding
to harmonics is filtered out. However, the tones at frequency f3 = 2f1 - f2 =
3/(2) and f4 = 2f1 - f2 = 4/(2) will be within the passband of the
amplifier if f1 and f2 are close. The appearence of these tones indicates third-
order distortion as the distortion is the result of third-order terms in the
power series expansion of the two-tone input-output characteristic as given
in Equation (4.68). That is, the output after filtering and removing the DC
component is

vo(t) = Vo,1 cos(1t) + Vo,2 cos(2t) + Vo,3 cos(3t) + Vo,4 cos(4t), (4.72)

where the component of the output

                        at    the  first  fundamental,      f1,    is  Vo,1  =     a1Vi  +  4 a3Vi ,33 (4.73)
                                                                                                       (4.74)
                 at the second fundamental, f2, is Vo,2 = a1Vi + 34 a3Vi3,                             (4.75)
                                                                                                       (4.76)
at the lower intermodulation frequency, f3, is Vo,3 = 34 a3Vi3,

at the upper intermodulation frequency, f4, is Vo,4 = 34 a3Vi3.
148  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

Figure 4-16: Output power versus input power
of an amplifier plotted on a logarithmic scale.
The IM3 response is a result of two-tone
intermodulation, and the input power is the
power of each of the two signals that have
equal amplitude. Extrapolations of the 1:1 linear
fundamental response and the 3:1 third-order
intermodulation response intersect at the IP3
point.

     Thus the level of the intermodulation tones, the IMD level, increases as the
     third power of the level of the two-tone input signal. Since the IMD levels
     vary as the third power of the input tone level (Vi), it is usual to refer to the
     tones at f3 and f4 as third-order intermods, or IM3 tones. The one-tone and
     IM3 responses are plotted in Figure 4-16 up until saturation, where higher-
     order terms in the Taylor expansion become important.

        The ratio of the amplitude of the intermodulation tones to the amplitude
     of the input tones (recall that they have equal amplitude) enables the third-
     order power series coefficient to be calculated. That is

     a3 = 3 4 Vo,3 = 4 Vo,4 .                      (4.77)
            3 Vi 3 Vi

        The gain and IM3 responses shown in Figure 4-16 are plotted on a
     logarithmic scale. First consider the gain response, which is plotted for a
     single sinewave input. At low input power levels the amplifier has linear
     gain and the output power, Po1, increases in proportion to the input power,
     Pi1, so the gain response has a 1:1 slope. As the input power further increases,
     the output power saturates primarily because the waveform at the output
     is constrained by the limits set by the supply and ground rails, but other
     nonlinearities of the transistor impact the linearity of the response before
     saturation is reached. The IM3 response (either the level of the f3 tone or
     the f4 tone) in Figure 4-16 is when the levels of two discrete tones are the
     same. Then typically the responses of the upper and lower IM3 tones are
     the same unless capacitive effects become important [29-32]. At low levels
     of the two input tones, each with power Pi3, the output power, Po3, at one
     of the IM3 tones increases as the third power of Pi3. Thus on a logarithmic
     scale the slope of Po3 versus Pi3 is 3:1. As the input power increases the
     IP3 response eventually saturates. The two simplest characterizations of the
     nonlinear response of an amplifier are the 1 dB gain compression power,
     as discussed before, and the intercept of the gain and IP3 responses. This
     intersection is called the third-order intercept point, or IP3 point (see Figure
     4-16). The input power at IP3 is called the input third-order intercept power,
     or IIP3, and the output is called the output third-order intercept power, or
     OIP3. If G is the linear power gain, OIP3 = G · IIP3. IIIP3 is mostly used
     with receivers and OIP3 is used with transmitters.

4.5.5 Spectral Regrowth

Distortion with digitally modulated signals consists of in-band and out-of-
band distortion. The generation of in-band (within the bandwidth of the
digitally modulated signal) intermodulation distortion in an amplifier, or
any other nonlinear device such as a mixer, affects the ability to resolve
the constellation of a received signal. Thus distortion generated in-band
affects the ability to interpret the constellation of the signal and hence
causes bit errors. However, the phase of the intermodulation products is of
little concern except in cascaded systems where the phase affects how IMD
distortion from different stages combines.

   Out-of-band distortion is represented in Figure 4-17, where the spectra
at the input and output of a nonlinear system are shown. The process that
results in increased signal levels in the adjacent sidebands is called spectral
regrowth. This distortion is similar to the intermodulation distortion with a
two-tone signal. The generation of signals in the adjacent channel affects the
function of other radios and the allowable level of these signals is contained
in system specifications.

150  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     4.5.6 Second-Order Distortion

     The previous subsection discussed intermodulation distortion and intro-
     duced the third-order intercept point, IP3, defined either by the input-
     referred power of IP3, IIP3, or the output-referred power of IP3, OIP3, to
     characterize third-order nonlinear performance. The same type of analysis
     can be used to characterize the second-order nonlinear performance of a mi-
     crowave module. Second-order distortion leads to the second harmonic of
     the input tones and to the difference frequency of the input tones. The com-
     ponents of the output response of the amplifier in Equation (4.68) at the sec-
     ond harmonic and difference frequency are:

     vo(t) = Vo,2nd,1 cos(21t) + Vo,2nd,2 cos(22t) + Vo,diff cos(2 - 1t). (4.78)

     where the amplitude at the output at the

     second      harmonic   of  f1             is  Vo,2nd,1     =   2 a2Vi12

     second      harmonic   of  f2             is  Vo,2nd,2     =   12 a2Vi2

     difference  frequency  f2  -  f1              is  Vo,diff  =   12 a2Vi .2(4.79)

     Thus the coefficient of the second-order term in the defining polynomial can
     be obtained from the amplitude of either of the second harmonics or of the
     difference tone.

     a2 = 2 2 Vo,2nd,1 = 2 2 Vo,2nd,2 = 2 2 Vo,niff                           (4.80)

        The gain and IM2 responses shown in Figure 4-18 are plotted on a
     logarithmic scale. At low input power levels the amplifier has a linear gain
     and initially the gain response has a 1:1 slope. The IM2 response (either
     the levels of the second harmonic tones or of the difference tone) in Figure
     4-18 is when the levels of two discrete tones are the same. At low levels
     of the two input tones, each with power Pi2, the output power, Po2, at
     one of the harmonic or difference tones increases as the quadratic of Pi32.
     Thus on a logarithmic scale the slope of Po2 versus Pi2 is 2:1. As the
     input power increases the IP2 response eventually saturates. The simplest
     characterizations of the second-order nonlinear response of an amplifier is
     the IP2 response and the IP2 intercept point, the second-order intercept point.
     The input power at IP2 is called the input second-order intercept power, or
     IIP2, and the output is called the output second-order intercept power, or
     OIP2.

     4.5.7 Summary

     The three simplest characterizations of the performance of an amplifier are
     the linear gain, the input or output power at the IM2 intercept point, IP2,
     and the input or output power at the IM3 intercept point, IP3, see Figures
     4-18 and 4-19. From these the first three coefficients of a polynomial model
     of an amplifier can be derived. The first, a1, comes from the linear gain, see.
     The second, a2, comes from the level of the harmonics or difference tones
     for a two-tone input signal, see Equation (4.80). The third, a3 comes from the
     level of third-order intermodulation tones, see Equation (4.77).

4.6 Dynamic Range

While modern communication and radar systems use digitally modulated
signals, two-tone signals are used to characterize nonlinearity (usually) and
also in manual calculations. At low powers before compression becomes a
factor, the fundamental response (i.e., output power versus input power)
initially has a 1:1 slope with respect to the input, as shown in Figure 4-19. The
third-order intermodulation, IM3, response varies as the cube of the level of
input tones when both tones vary by the same amount, as is common in
a two-tone test. Thus the IM3 response initially has a 3:1 logarithmic slope
with respect to the input. Since the relations are linear in a log-log sense,
it is possible to describe the nonlinear performance of an amplifier by a
quantity called the dynamic range (DR) or by the similar spurious free
dynamic range (SFDR). SFDR describes the difference between the level
at which a signal is distorted and the level of noise (i.e., the noise floor).
DR is similar to SFDR except that the level of the minimum discernible

The IM2 response is a result of two-tone
intermodulation (or of harmonic generation),
and the input power is the power of each
of the two signals that have equal amplitude.
Extrapolations of the 1:1 linear fundamental
response and the 2:1 second-order response
intersect at the IP2 point.

IP3 point.
152  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     signal (MDS) (also called the minimum detectable signal) is used instead
     of the noise floor. MDS is higher than the level of the noise floor by the
     minimum acceptable SNR (SNRMIN). SNRMIN is dependent on the type of
     modulation, on hardware inadequacies (captured by the implementation
     margin), on processing gain, and on the error correction coding used in a
     particular communications protocol.

        It is interesting to note that the 1 dB gain compression level has no effect
     on the dynamic range of microwave circuits and systems. This is because
     dynamic range is concerned with the ability to detect a signal when it
     is possible for the desired signal to be masked by spurious signals. Gain
     compression on its own does not introduce spurious signals so it does not
     interfere with the ability to detect a small signal.

        The dynamic range does not relate to how accurately the sampled received
     signal matches the constellation diagram of the transmitted digitally
     modulated signal. Distortion of the constellation diagram is determined by
     noise, gain compression, and intermodulation distortion.

        In the following, an expression for SFDR is developed in terms of
     input-referenced quantities, and this form of the SFDR is called the input
     referred SFDR (SFDRi). A similarly referenced dynamic range (DRi) is also
     developed.

        Figure 4-19 graphically defines the dynamic ranges. The point of
     intersection of the extrapolated linear and IM3 responses is called the third-
     order intercept point (IP3 intercept). The point is identified by the output-
     referred intercept power (OIP3) or by the input-referred IP3 intercept power
     (IIP3) and these are key parameters in describing the linearity of nonlinear
     subsystems.

        In the linear gain region, the output power Po versus the input power Pi
     has a slope of 1:1, so that

     PdBm,i = PdBm,o - GdB,                 (4.81)

     where GdB is the power gain in decibels. Po is used here as the output power,
     with PdBm,o indicating the output power in dBm. Pi and PdBm,i are similarly
     defined. In terms of input quantities

     IIP3 = OIP3 = IIP3dBm= OIP3dBm - GdB,  (4.82)
                 G

     where again the dBm subscript indicates that the quantity is expressed in
     decibels referred to 1 mW.

        The nonlinearity of RF active components results in harmonics and inter-
     modulation components. With the narrowband amplifiers of communication
     and radar systems, output filters conveniently filter out harmonics. How-
     ever, intermodulation distortion cannot be filtered out, as these components
     are within the main passband. The intermodulation components are there-
     fore spurious tones. Generally just one of these defines the maximum spuri-
     ous tone and nearly always it is one of the third-order intermodulation tones
     resulting from a two-tone input. Consideration of the maximum spurious
     tone and the noise floor defines the SFDR.

        Examining Figure 4-19 leads to the following inequality describing the
NOISE, DISTORTION, AND DYNAMIC RANGE                                                 153

linear gain of the amplifier:

          OIP3dBm - PdBm,o =                  OIP3dBm - PdBm,o

          IIP3dBm - PdBm,i (OIP3dBm - GdB) - PdBm,i

                                        = 1.                         (4.83)

The IM3 response is characterized by first introducing an equivalent input
power, PdBm,i3 (Pi3 expressed in dBm), defined as the average power of the
two-tone signal that generates an IM3 of power PdBm,o3. Noting that PdBm,o3
varies with a 3:1 logarithmic slope with respect to PdBm,i3, then

                    OIP3dBm - PdBm,o3 = 3                            (4.84)
               (OIP3dBm - GdB) - PdBm,i3

or                    1
                      3
          PdBm,i3  =           (2 ·  OIP3dBm  + PdBm,o3   - 3GdB) .  (4.85)

The SFDR can now be defined when the third-order intermodulation product

of two-tone excitation is the dominant spurious tone. The SFDR is defined as

the difference between Pi3 and Pi when they produce IM3 and linear output,

respectively, that are both equal to the output noise power, No (see Figure

4-19); that is, when Po = Po3 = No. Replacing PdBm,o in Equation (4.85) with

No gives              1
                      3
          PdBm,i3  =           (2 · OIP3dBm   + NdBm,o    - 3GdB)    (4.86)

and

                      PdBm,i = NdBm,o - GdB.                         (4.87)

Note that the difference between the linear output and the third-order
intermodulation reduces as the input power increases above Pi3. Thus the
output-referred SFDR is

     SFDRdB,o = PdBm,i3 - PdBm,i

          = 23 OIP3dBm + 31 NdBm,o - GdB - NdBm,o + GdB

          =        2  (OIP3dBm             -  NdBm,o)  .             (4.88)
                   3

So SFDR is 2/3rds of the range in decibels from the noise intercept to the
third order intercept point. A similar development defines the identical
input-referred SFDR:

          SFDRdB,i                   =  2  (IIP3dBm  - NdBm,i) .     (4.89)
                                        3

   Note that Ni is the input-referred noise and includes noise applied to the
module as well as the noise produced internally in the module and referred
to the input. The SFDR provides a combined measure of distortion and noise.
However, for usable dynamic range the minimum acceptable SNR must be
considered. The minimum SNR (SNRMIN) required is determined by the
communication or radar modulation format, error coding, and acceptable
BER. So in defining DR, the input power of the desired signal must increase
sufficiently to produce an SNR of at least SNRMIN. Since the desired spurious
level is still at the noise floor, this implies a direct subtraction in decibels of
the desired SNR. Therefore the input-referred third-order dynamic range,
preferred for receivers, is

          DRi  =   2  (IIP3dBm             - NdBm,i  - SNRdB,MIN)    (4.90)
                   3
154  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     and the output-referred dynamic range, preferred for transmitters, is

     DRo  =  2  (OIP3dBm  - NdBm,o  - SNRMIN) .                             (4.91)
             3

     The minimum discernible signal at the output is

     MDSdBm,o = NdBm,o + SNRdB,MIN,                                         (4.92)

     so the output-referred dynamic range can be written as

     DRo        =  2  (OIP3dBm  -  MDSdBm,o) .                              (4.93)
                   3

     So DR is 2/3rds of the range in decibels from the level of the minimum
     detectable signal to the third order intercept point. The minimum discernible
     signal at the input is

     MDSdBm,i = NdBm,i + SNRdB,MIN                                          (4.94)

     and the input-referred dynamic range (equal to DRo) can be written as

          DRi   =  2  (IIP3dBm  - MDSdBm,i) .                               (4.95)
                   3

     4.7 Passive Intermodulation Distortion

     Passive intermodulation distortion (PIM) is the term used to describe
     nonlinear distortion that occurs when passive components are supposedly
     linear. Just as with nonlinear components such as amplifiers, the generation
     of spurious tones can swamp small received signals. The typical test of
     PIM is a two-tone test in which two large equal-amplitude sinusoids are
     applied to the device under test (DUT) and the level of the intermodulation
     signals measured. Except for the DUT generating the distortion being
     passive, distortion appears as described in Section 4.5. PIM is observed in
     a wide number of situations including coaxial cables [33, 34], microstrip
     transmission lines [35], attenuators [36], terminations [37, 38], rectangular
     waveguides [39, 40], antennas, and filters [41, 42].

     4.7.1 Sources of PIM

     Several causes of PIM have been identified or suggested. These include self-
     heating and nonlinear junction effects when currents flow from one metal
     into a dissimilar metal. The concept being that the dissimilar metals form a
     weak diode-like current-voltage characteristic [39].

        The most convenient method for measuring small levels of PIM uses
     a filter to separate a small distorted intermodulation signal from the two
     driving tones. The finite filter response requires that the RF tones be at least
     1 MHz apart. However, distortion that is less than 1 MHz from a signal is
     of concern in RF systems. Several measurements have shown that the level
     of distortion increases rapidly as the distortion component gets closer in
     frequency to the driving signal [37].

        Figure 4-20 shows the third-order PIM of terminations measured in a two-
     tone test [43]. The PIM level is plotted against the frequency separation of
     the two tones. Similar results are seen with other components including
     transmission lines and antennas [35-38]. The low-PIM termination, resulting
     in Curve (a) in Figure 4-20, is the lowest PIM termination available

comprising, here, a terminated 100 m long slightly lossy cable with a loss of
0.1 dB/m. The distributed low-level loss spreads the heat generated out over
a considerable distance and so there is a negligible electrothermal PIM effect.
Curves (b) and (c) plot the measured PIM for two otherwise identical finned
N-type connectors. Curves (d) and (e) plot the measured PIM for another
pair of connectors. The reason for the discrepancy is unknown. The rapid
rise in PIM below 200 Hz tone separation is due to electrothermal effects.

   The rapid increase in the level of PIM as the tone separation reduces is due
to electrothermal effects. When close in frequency, the two tones produce a
beating waveform that periodically heats a conductor, changing its resistance
through the thermal coefficient of resistance of the conductor. This change in
resistance results in a periodic variation of the current-voltage relation ( i.e.,
Ohm's law) which results in the generation of intermodulation tones. It has
been shown that if dissimilar metals and magnetic materials are avoided, the
PIM generated is entirely due to electrothermal effects [37].

   With tone spacings exceeding a few hundred kilohertz, or in some cases
a few megahertz, the PIM is being generated through another mechanism.
Several sources of this PIM have been postulated, and while all could be
physical sources of PIM, which is most important is not clear. PIM has been
shown to be almost entirely due to current density effects so reducing current
density is an effective means to reduce PIM [44]. Plausible mechanisms
generating such PIM include metal-insulator-metal and metal-metal contact
nonlinearities [45], particularly due to surface topography at contacts. For
example, it is known that high force applied across contacts reduces PIM. In
cellular base stations where the power of signals is very high, it is known to
be important to have very tight connections of cables carrying high-power
signals.

   Tunneling at a metal-insulator-metal contact could produce PIM. This
is supposed to be a particular problem with aluminum-oxide-aluminum
contacts, as the oxide thickness may be just right, 2 nm, for tunneling to
occur [40, 45]. However, this is expected to be a minor contributor to PIM.
156  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     Another possible source of PIM is thermionic emission [46]. Thermionic
     emission is secondary to tunneling and will result in a small increase in
     tunneling current due to other sources [46].

        The metal-to-metal contact of dissimilar metals acts as a weak diode due to
     the difference in the work functions of the metals. Alignment of Fermi levels
     requires charge to transfer from the high work function metal to the low
     work function metal. Since charge transfer has occurred between the metals,
     a field therefore exists at the interface and so there is a contact potential. It is
     known that copper, silver, and gold contacts form low PIM contacts and these
     metals have very similar work functions, supporting the view above. Also at
     metal-to-metal contacts there is a constriction of current flow due to rough
     surface topology that exaggerates PIM due to increased current density.

        Ferromagnetic materials such as iron, steel, cobalt, and nickel produce
     high significant PIM [47]. This is also true for ferroelectric and piezoelectric
     materials.

     4.7.2 Summary

     There are many possible sources of PIM, and provided that care is used
     in avoiding dissimilar metals and avoiding ferromagnetic materials, the
     only confirmed source of RF PIM is the electrothermal self-heating effect
     [35, 37]. However, it is not always possible to build such components as
     desirable mechanical, electrical, and packaging requirements necessitate the
     use of dissimilar elements. Ferromagnetic metals such as nickel, a desirable
     processing material, produce significant PIM. With dissimilar nonmagnetic
     materials there is clearly another (unknown) source of PIM at high tone
     spacings. Even with carefully designed components, PIM exists at large tone
     spacings, and the main source of PIM in these circumstances has not yet
     been identified. There is a reasonable confidence that such PIM is a current
     nonlinearity and not a voltage nonlinearity [44]. So a strategy for reducing
     PIM is to avoid high current densities, and for electrothermal PIM, to provide
     rapid dissipation of heat as close to the source of heat as possible. Other
     sources of PIM-like responses, that is, RF distortion where it is not expected,
     have been found due to vibration [48, 49] and the transient response of a
     filter [41, 42].

     4.8 Breakdown

     Breakdown occurs when the electric field is strong enough that a stray
     electron strips electrons from atoms or molecules resulting a cascading effect
     producing a conducting plasma of electrons. There are two types of effects
     that cause breakdown. One of these is the multipactor effect which occurs at
     the interface of a metal or dielectric with a vacuum or low pressure gas where
     electrons are stripped from the metal or dielectric. The other is the corona
     effect which occurs in a gas, even at fairly low pressures, in which electrons
     are stripped from atoms or molecules in the gas. The plasma of electrons
     shorts conducting surfaces at different potential, and in the worst case causes
     destruction of components. But even before a sufficiently dense plasma is
     established, effects include noise generation, increase in ohmic losses, and
     nonlinear signal distortion since breakdown is strongly nonlinear effect the
     number of free electrons created is a strong nonlinear function of electric field
NOISE, DISTORTION, AND DYNAMIC RANGE                                                    157

and thus voltage.

4.8.1 Multipactor Effect

The multipactor effect is due to the secondary emission of electrons when a
fast moving electron in a vacuum or low pressure gas impacts a metal or a
dielectric. If the energy of the free electron is above a first critical field Ec1, an
electron in the material will be excited and sometimes will be emitted from
the material. The initial electron will penetrate the material by several lattice
constants but follow a zig-zag path. If the energy of this electron is below
a second critical value Ec2, then it will only penetrate one or a few lattice
constants and will itself be emitted back into the vacuum (or low pressure
gas). If the electron has an initial energy above Ec2 then it will penetrate
the material a considerable distance and will become trapped. The actual
material and the surface finish have a significant effect on electron emission.

   The number of electrons that leave the surface for each impacting electron
is called the secondary electron emission yield (SEY) and this includes the
initial electron which may or may not be emitted. If SEY is greater than one
then the number of free electron will avalanche and could eventually lead
to device destruction. Before that occurs, there is a balancing effect which
limits growth in free electron numbers. Principle among these is the field
that is produced by the free electrons themselves which counters the field
created by an externally applied voltage potential. The reference geometry
used in measuring the multipactor effect is a parallel plate structure with
a voltage V between the plates that are separated by a distance d. This
geometry generally has the lowest thresholds for the multipactor effect. For
other geometries, i.e. non-parallel plate geometries, the high field region
where the secondary electrons are created may not be where the plasma,
i.e. the region where the free electrons accumulate, is located. Thus the
growth in the number of free electrons is curtailed. A further limiting effect
is the frequency of the signal applied to the plates where a high frequency
signal could reverse limiting the build-up of free electrons. Thus the applied
voltage, Vmultipactor, required to initiate the multipactor effect is a function
of d, material, material finish, and frequency f . If there is a free electron
between the plates then the electron will accelerate and acquire velocity and
thus energy. The voltage required to initiate impact ionization. It is found
experimentally that there is a minimum voltage Vmin required for the effect
to be initiated. Then there is a linear relationship between Vmultipactor and
the product f · d. Materials and material finish also have an impact on
ionization For example cleaned mirror-finish silver has a first critical energy,
Ec1 = 130 eV whereas silver exposed to the air has Ec1 = 20 eV. Guidelines
for the thresholds for multipactor ionization for various materials are given
in [50].

4.8.2 Corona Effect

Multipaction describes ionization of materials in a vacuum or in when the
environment has a low pressure gas. As the pressure of the gas increases the
molecules in the gas will breakdown and this is called the corona effect. If
e is an electron and M is a molecule then the corona ionization process is
158                      STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     described by

                                 e + M  e + e + M+             (4.96)

     and the molecule takes on a positive charge after an electron has been
     stripped off. The competing process which limits the number of free electrons
     available is when a free electron combines with a molecule and in air these
     interactions principally involve nitrogen N and oxygen O:

                   e  +     +    N  +  N  and  e + O2  O- + O  (4.97)

                         N2

        The minimum energy required for the corona effect is heavily dependent
     on gas pressure. At very low pressures ionization is solely due to
     multipaction. Above a critical but low pressure multipaction is replaced by
     the corona effect as as the density of molecules increases it becomes easier to
     ionize more molecules. The minimum energy required for the corona effect
     occurs when the pressure in multiples of standard atmospheric pressure is
     approximately equal to the frequency in gigahertz. Further increase in the
     pressure reduces the free main path of an electron and fewer free electrons
     are able to acquire the requisition energy. [50].

     4.8.3 Summary

     Breakdown can lead to device destruction but even at very low levels it
     can cause intermodulation products, i.e. passive intermodulation distortion,
     that obscure small received signals. Breakdown is a particular problem when
     there are high fields, especially in filters with high energy densities because
     of resonance. Breakdown can be a problem in basestations, radars, and
     satellites as these often operate with EM powers of kilowatts to megawatts,
     and even higher powers when operated with low duty cycles.

     4.9 Summary

     The use of modules has become increasingly important in microwave en-
     gineering. A wide variety of passive and active modules are available and
     high-performance systems can be realized enabling many microwave sys-
     tems of low-to-medium volumes to be realized cost effectively and with
     stellar performance. Module vendors are encouraged by the market to de-
     velop competitive modules that can be used in a wide variety of applications.
     The challenge is to develop a module with high performance and adapt-
     ability. Many modules have matched 50  input and output impedances so
     that modules can be freely interconnected. Many integrated systems are first
     prototyped using vendor-supplied modules that are, perhaps, gradually re-
     placed by higher-performance monolithically integrated implementations.
     Doing so is only justified when unit volumes are very high. The availabil-
     ity of evaluation boards with coaxial connectors for many modules makes it
     easy to do early design trade-offs. The great majority of RF and microwave
     engineers either develop modules or use modules to realize RF systems.

        The most important part of a system design is achieving the desired
     functionality largely arrived at by choosing a suitable topology, usually
     cascaded subsystems, and appropriate functional units (i.e., modules).
     Then the major concern in design is managing noise, distortion, DC
     power consumption, cost, and size. The noise and distortion concerns

can be combined together as dynamic range and then the objective is
maximizing dynamic range while controlling DC power consumption and
using affordable modules. Systems must also be concerned with distortion
that originates in supposedly linear elements. Something as simple as a
termination can produce PIM through heating and thus resistance changes.

5.1 Introduction to Passive Modules

Most RF systems are composed of a cascade of modules each of which is
separately designed and characterized. They usually have matched 50 
input and output impedances so that modules can be freely interconnected.
In high volume applications, several modules could be monolithically
integrated, but even then, design is based on the concept of modules. Many
modules are available "off the shelf" and high-performance RF systems can
be constructed using commercially available modules, see Figure 5-1.

   Many modules are available mounted on evaluation boards complete
with biasing components and SMA connectors so that RF modules can be
interconnected using coaxial cables. For example, an evaluation board is
shown in Figure 5-2 for a power amplifier. The engineer needs to attach
supply, Vs, ground, and control voltage Vctl, and the evaluation board
provides a working amplifier. Most RF and microwave engineers work
at the circuit board level and begin system design using modules. Some
companies develop some of their own proprietary modules, thus providing
a competitive advantage, but still use many modules developed by others.
An estimate sometimes made is that the value of RF and microwave circuit-
board-based module-using engineering is 30 times larger than the value of
module and RF integrated circuit engineering.

   The modules that comprise a receiver are shown in Figure 5-3. Beginning
with the bandpass filter after the antenna, each module contributes noise and
nonlinear distortion. The system design objectives are generally to maximize
dynamic range, the region between the signal being sufficiently above the
noise level to be detected but before nonlinear distortion introduces spurious

signals that limit the detectability of signals. At the same time, it is usual
to try and minimize the power consumed. This is particularly important in
mobile applications.

   This chapter introduces many passive modules;modules and microwave
functional elements that do not require external supplies with he exception
of perhaps control voltages..

5.2 Diodes

Diodes are two-terminal devices that have nonlinear current-voltage
characteristics. The most common diodes used in microwave engineering
are listed in Table 5-1 along with their standard symbols. Ideally a rectifier
allows current to flow in one direction and not in the other. A general diode,
usually a junction diode or a Schottky diode, is one type of rectifier, but
rectifiers are more general, and, for example, they can be realized using
vacuum devices.

Junction and Schottky Diodes

Junction diodes are two-terminal devices that derive their characteristics
from the barrier effect that occurs at the junction of two different types
of semiconductor (one with excess free holes and one with excess free
electrons), or at the interface of a metal and a semiconductor. The result is
an asymmetric current-voltage characteristic, as shown in Figure 5-4(a). This
is not an ideal rectifier characteristic, as it requires a threshold voltage to be
reached before there is appreciable current flow. Semiconductor-based diode

                                                                    nkT

                 where V is the voltage across the junction, q(= -e) is the absolute value of

                 the charge of an electron, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.37 · 10-23 J/K), and

                 T is the absolute temperature (in kelvin). I0 is the reverse saturation current

                 and is small, with values ranging from 1 pA to 1 nA. The quantity n is the

                 diode ideality factor, with n = 2 for graded-junction pn junction diodes and

                 n = 1.0 for step-junction diodes where the interface between p-type and n-

                 type semiconductor materials is abrupt. The abrupt junction is most closely

                 realized by a Schottky diode, where a metal forms one side of the interface

                 (typically) replacing the p-type semiconductor. Carriers recombine quickly

                 in the metal, much faster than they would in a semiconductor. Hence a

                 Schottky diode operates at higher frequencies than does a pn junction diode.

                 A unity ideality factor, n, of 1 is the best that can be achieved, resulting in

                 the strongest nonlinearity. When the applied voltage is sufficiently positive

                 to cause a large current to flow, the diode is said to be forward biased. When

                 the voltage is negative, the current flow is negligible and the diode is said

                 to be reverse biased. At sufficiently large reverse bias, electrons are ripped

                 from the valence bands of the semiconductor atoms and the current rapidly

                 increases in a process called impact ionization or avalanche. The voltage at

                 which this occurs is called the reverse breakdown voltage.

                     In a semiconductor diode, charge is separated over distance and so a diode

                 has appreciable capacitance, called the junction capacitance, mathematically

                 modeled as                                           Cj0 ,

                                                  Cj(V ) =       (1 - (V /))                            (5.2)

                 where  is the built-in potential difference across the diode. This capacitance

                 profile is shown in Figure 5-4(b). The built-in potential is typically 0.6 V for

                 silicon diodes and 0.75 V for GaAs diodes. The doping profile can be adjusted

                     Current must flow through bulk semiconductor before reaching the active

                 region of the semiconductor diode, and so there will be a resistive voltage

                 drop. Combining effects leads to the equivalent circuit of a pn junction or

                 Schottky diode shown in Figure 5-4(c).

                 Varactor Diode

                 A varactor diode is a pn junction diode operated in reverse bias and
                 optimized for good performance as a tunable capacitor. Ideally it has low
RF AND MICROWAVE MODULES                                                          169

reverse saturation current, high reverse breakdown voltage, and a specific
capacitance profile designed for a particular application.

   A common application of a varactor diode is as the tunable element
in a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) where the varactor, with voltage-
dependent capacitance, C, is part of a resonant circuit (often called a tank
circuit) with a lumpedinductor, L. The resonant frequency of the tank circuit
is proportional to 1/ LC, so by applying a voltage to a varactor diode,
C changes, the resonant frequency of the tank circuit is tuned, and the
oscillation frequency is changed. The capacitance versus voltage is described
by Equation (5.2) and voltage dependence is shown in Figure 5-4(b).

PIN Diode

A PIN diode is a variation on a pn junction diode with a region of intrinsic
semiconductor (the I in PIN) between the p-type and n-type semiconductor
regions. The properties of the PIN diode depend on whether there are
carriers in the intrinsic region. The PIN diode has the current-voltage
characteristics of a pn junction diode at low frequencies; however, at high
frequencies it looks like a linear resistor, as carriers in the intrinsic region
move slowly. When a forward DC voltage is applied to the PIN diode, the
intrinsic region floods with carriers, and at microwave frequencies the PIN
diode is then modeled as a low-value resistor. At high frequencies there is
not enough time to remove the carriers in the intrinsic region, so even if
the total voltage (DC plus RF) across the PIN diode is negative, there are
carriers in the intrinsic region throughout the RF cycle. If the DC voltage is
negative, carriers are removed from the intrinsic region and the diode looks
like a large-value resistor at RF. The PIN diode can be used as a microwave
switch controlled by a DC voltage.

Zener Diode

Zener diodes are pn junction or Schottky diodes that have been specially
designed to have sharp reverse breakdown characteristics [5]. They can
be used to establish a voltage reference or, used as a limiter diode, to
provide protection of more sensitive circuitry. As a limiter, they are found in
communication devices in a back-to-back configuration to limit the voltages
that can be applied to sensitive RF circuitry.

LED Diode

In semiconductor diodes, the recombination of holes and electrons can result
in photons being generated. This effect is enhanced to form light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) [4, 5, 7, 8].

     The applied bias voltage also changes the series resistance of the diode,
     see Figure 5-4. The characteristics of a microwave varactor are shown in
     Figure 5-5. At a reverse bias voltage VR = 1 V the junction capacitance
     Cj = 7 pF and the series resistance is 1.8 . At 5 GHz the diode impedance
     ZD(1 V ) = 1.8 - 4.54  and its Q(1 V ) = 2.5. At a reverse bias voltage
     VR = 10 V, the junction capacitance iCj = 1 pF, and the series resistance
     is 0.4 . At 5 GHz the diode impedance ZD(1 V ) = 0.4 - 31.8  and its
     Q(1 V ) = 80.

        Generally a design proceeds based on a chosen system impedance which is
     often 50  so that the design space includes realizable impedances above and
     below a system impedance. One way of effectively increasing the impedance
     of a varactor diode is to stack diodes. This is shown in Figure 5-6 where four

varactor diodes D1, . . . , D4 are shown together with the biasing arrangement
so that the each of the diodes can be adjusted by the single tuning voltage
Vtune applied through the 3.6 nH and 8.2 nH choke inductors. The choke
inductors provide a DC short and an RF open (actually an impedance
magnitude of 258  for the 8.2 nH inductor at 5 GHz). Figure 5-6 is the
schematic of a tunable resonator, used between 4 and 5.3 GHz to tune an
oscillator, see [9] and Section 5.6 of [10].

   The two 0.5 pF capacitors in Figure 5-6 scale the capacitance of the
diode stack and increase the effective Q of the variable capacitance. The
shorted transmission line presents an inductance impedance in shunt with
the augmented diode stack. A lumped inductor is not used here as it would
have too high a loss. The equivalent circuit of the resonator is shown in
Figure 5-7. The resonator network is designed to be resonant at a frequency
above the operating frequency. At the oscillation frequency the resonator
network must present an inductance to resonate with the capacitance of the
active device in an oscillator. In addition, for oscillator stability, the effective
inductance must have a particular derivative of admittance with respect to
frequency.

   The two 0.5pF capacitors between TL1 and the varactor stack combine
to provide an effective capacitance of 0.25 pF which has an impedance of
127  at 5 GHz. So it is not a DC blocking capacitor which would have a
very low impedance at RF, but it does block DC so that Vtune is not shorted
to ground through the transmission line. The RF function of the two series
0.5 pF capacitors is to reduce the value of the variable capacitance, increase
the operating reactance, and increase the Q of the effective capacitance.
Each varactor diode has a 0 V capacitance of 11 pF and a capacitance at
9 V of 2.15 pF. With the four varactors in series this becomes 2.75 pF total
capacitance at 0 V and 0.54 pF at 9 V. The 0.25 pF capacitance in series reduces
this to 0.229 pF at 0 V tuning voltage and 0.171 pF at 9 V tuning voltage for a
capacitance tuning ratio of 0.229 pF/0.171 pF = 1.34. The capacitance tuning
range has been reduced from the original ratio of 2.75 pF/ 0.54 pf = 5.05.
The tuning range of the resonant frequency of a parallel LC resonator is the
square root of this, i.e. 1.16 (which comes from the resonant frequency being
1/ LC). If this is not enough the two 0.5 pF capacitors can be changed to
achieve the required overall capacitance tuning ratio.

   The 10 pF capacitor between the Vtune terminal and ground is there to
ensure an RF short circuit. The magnitude if the impedance of this capacitor
at 5 GHz is 3.2 , a factor of ten away from the 50  system impedance.
While at RF the terminal at Vtune is ideally a short circuit to ground, there
will always be some wiring inductance.

   The characteristics of the resonator can be understood by looking at the
plot of the simulated resonator reflection coefficient, r, on a Smith chart,
see Figure 5-8. r is shown for two tuning voltages as well as the device
locus of the inverse of the input reflection coefficient of a transistor circuit

                         connected to the resonator. The combination of the resonator and the active
                         device forms an oscillator. The intersection of the active device and resonator
                         loci selects the oscillation frequency of the oscillator. The oscillator presents a
                         capacitance to the resonator and so the resonator must present an inductance
                         to the active device. The frequency of the oscillator is varied by changing r
                         of the resonator.

                            A photograph of the resonator is shown in Figure 5-9. The measured r is
                         shown in Figure 5-10 and this corresponds to the simulated plot in Figure 5-8.
                         The two plots are roughly in agreement but there is a discrepancy because it
                         is very hard to do these measurements at 5 GHz, and the models of the device
                         components are not exact. However the main reason for the discrepancy is
                         that this is a measurement of a resonant circuit and small discontinuities can
                         have a dramatic effect. What is presented here is typical of microwave circuit
                         design and why tremendous intuition is required to design at microwave
                         frequencies and to interpret measurements.

                     5.4 Switch

                         Microwave switches are commonly used to alternately connect an antenna
                         to a transmitter or a receiver. In some communication systems, such as
                         GSM and some modes of 4G and 5G, a phone does not transmit and
                         receive simultaneously. Consequently a switch can be used to separate the
                         transmitted and received signals. In multiband phones, a switch is used
                         to connect the correct transmitter and receiver, which are band specific,
                         to the antenna. In radar systems, switches are used to steer an antenna
                         beam by changing the phase of the microwave signal delivered to each
                         antenna in an array of antennas. An ideal microwave switch is shown in

                          is shown and indicates that
                          the active device oresents a

                          Thus adjusting Vtune changes
                          the oscilaltion frequency.
174  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     Figure 5-11(a), where an input port, RFIN, and an output port, RFOUT, are
     shown. For maximum power transfer between the ports the switch should
     have little loss and thus have low on resistance. At microwave frequencies,
     realistic switches must be modeled with parasitics and with finite on and
     off resistances. A realistic model applicable to many switch types is shown
     in Figure 5-11(b). The capacitive parasitics, the CP s, limit the frequency of
     operation of the switches and the on resistance, RON, impacts the switch
     loss. Ideally the off resistance, ROFF, is very large, however, the parasitic
     shunt capacitance, COFF, is nearly always more significant. The result is that
     at high frequencies there is an alternative capacitive connection between the
     input and output through COFF. The on resistance of the switch introduces
     voltage division that can be seen by comparing the ideal connection shown
     in Figure 5-11(c) and the more realistic connection shown in Figure 5-11(d).
     From the voltage division ratio, the loss of the switch can be calculated.

        Switches are configured to provide connections from one or more inputs to
     one or more outputs. The configuration of a switch is indicated by poles and
     throws, and several configurations are shown in Figure 5-12. In microwave
     applications, single-pole switches are most commonly used and the input is
     connected to an antenna. For example, the throws would be connected to
     different bands of a multiband phone .

   There are four main types of microwave switches: mechanical, PIN diode,
FET, and microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches. Mechanical
switches are nearly lossless but tend to be large, relatively expensive, slow to
operate, and are mostly used in laboratory settings. The other switches are
of most interest for use in systems. The PIN diode, FET, and MEMS switches
are shown in Figures 5-11(e-g), respectively. With these technologies, most
higher-order switches are based on interconnections of SPST switches. The
attributes of these switches are summarized in Table 5-2 for switches that are
suitable for cell phone applications. PIN diode switches are the most robust,
handling the most RF power, and operating at higher frequencies than either
FET- or MEMS-based switches. However, this comes at a price. The PIN
diode used is similar to a pn junction diode with the addition of an intrinsic
layer between the p- and n-type materials. With applied forward bias the
diode has low RF series resistance. In reverse bias, the diode RF resistance
is large. Forward bias requires DC current and voltage, so control power is
consumed when a PIN diode switch is on. The circuit configuration for an
SPST PIN diode switch is shown in Figure 5-11(e). Series bias-decoupling
capacitors are required at the RF ports.

   A FET makes a good electronic switch; with the correct bias applied to
the gate, the drain-source connection looks like a small resistance. Changing
the bias to the other extreme removes free carriers from the channel between
the drain and source, and a large resistance is the result. Both Si and GaAs

           loss of a switch in a 50  system.

           switches are used in cellular handsets, with GaAs switches operating at
           extended frequencies approaching 6 GHz. The operation of a FET can be
           described as a variable drain-source resistance with the gate-source voltage
           controlling the cross section of the channel. The circuit for a FET-based SPST
           switch is shown in Figure 5-11(f). Series bias-blocking capacitors are required
           at the RF ports. Control power is only required to change the state of the
           switch; negligible power is required to maintain the switch state.

              A MEMS switch is fabricated using photolithographic techniques similar
           to those used in semiconductor manufacturing [11-13]. They are essentially
           miniature mechanical switches with a voltage used to control the position of
           a shorting arm, which is usually a cantilever or a membrane, see Figure 5-13.
           As there is no direct connection between the RF signal path and the control
           circuitry, MEMS switches have inherently high operating frequencies. Power
           is required to change the switch, but once switching has been accomplished,
           negligible DC power is required to maintain the connection. Two of the
           major problems are creating the contact with enough force to reduce the
           series resistance, and maintaining the structural integrity of the contacts after
           hundreds of millions of cycles. Generally it is not necessary to make a DC
           contact, and creating a structure that has a large difference between the on
           capacitance and off capacitance is sufficient for applications such as tunable
           matching networks [11].

EXAMPLE 5.1 Insertion Loss of a Switch

What is the insertion loss of a switch with a 1  on resistance when it used in a 50  system?

Solution:

The model to be used for evaluating the insertion loss of the switch is shown in Figure 5-14.
The insertion loss is found by first determining the available power from the source and
then the actual power delivered to the load. The available input power is calculated by first
ignoring the 1  switch resistance. Then there is maximum power transfer from the source
to the load. The available input power is

                          PAi = 1 21 E 2 = E2 ,           (5.3)

where E is the peak RF voltage at the Thevenin equivalent source generator. The power
delivered to the 50  load is found after first determining the peak load voltage:

                       VL = 50 E = 50 E. (5.4)
                               50 + 1 + 50 101

Thus the power delivered to the load is

5.5 Ferrite Components: Circulators and Isolators

Circulators and isolators are nonreciprocal devices that preferentially route
RF signals [14-16]. The essential element of a circulator is a slab or disc of
ferrite which, when magnetized, becomes nonreciprocal, with a preferred
direction of propagation resulting from what is called the gyromagnetic
effect.

5.5.1 Gyromagnetic Effect

An electron has an intrinsic magnetic field described by its magnetic moment
m (see Figure 5-15(a)) [17]. This is due to a quantum mechanical property
called spin bu the electron does not actually spin. In most materials electron
spin occurs in pairs with the magnetic field produced by one electron's spin
being canceled by the spin of the other electron. However, in some materials
the spin does not occur in pairs and there are regions in which the small
magnetic fields produced at the atomic level line up to produce organized
regions of directed magnetic field. These regions are called domains, or
sometimes magnetic domains, and the combined magnetic field from the
aligned electron spins is called a magnetic moment.

   The most common magnetic material is ferrite, which is a ceramic
containing iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). Very strong magnetic effects are obtained
with materials containing rare earth elements. The rare earth elements,
the lanthanoid elements, can align the spins of many electrons of each
atom and can produce particularly strong magnetic domains and magnetic
moments. The most common rare earth elements used in magnetic materials
are samarium and neodymium used in samarium-cobalt and neodymium-
iron-boron magnets, respectively.

   The domains can be aligned by a strong externally generated magnetic

     applied magnetic bias field.

     field (e.g., using an electromagnet), and once the domains are aligned they
     can stay that way for years even when the external field is removed. This
     situation is shown in Figure 5-15(b), where the individual domains have
     been almost completely aligned. Each crystal of the material will usually
     have many magnetic domains and a domain can grow in size (while another
     reduces or disappears), but generally a domain will not cross a crystal
     boundary. The domains can also be partially rotated by a moderate applied
     magnetic field and when the applied field is removed the domains return
     to their original alignment. The result is that magnetic energy is stored in
     much the same way as energy is stored in a spring. The amount of energy
     that is stored depends on the orientation of the applied magnetic field to
     the domains. The energy storage capability is described by the permeability
     of the material. In the absence of a constant biasing magnetic field, the
     permeability would have three values, one for each of the x, y, and z
     directions.

        A most interesting microwave property occurs when the magnetic
     material is biased by a strong DC magnetic field. This situation is depicted
     in Figure 5-15(c). When a time-varying magnetic field is alsoapplied (e.g.,
     the magnetic component of an EM field), the magnetic moment vector will
     tend to rotate around the DC magnetic field as shown. This is called the
     gyromagnetic effect. When the frequency of the applied field corresponds
     to the characteristic frequency of rotation of the magnetic moment then
     the effect is called gyromagnetic resonance and there is sustained low loss
     rotation.

        Even without resonance (because the magnetic bias field is too small)
     the gyromagnetic effect affects the way an RF field propagates and this is
     described by a nine element permeability called a tensor (or a dyadic or a
     dyadic tensor) that relates each of the three H field components (in the x-, y-,
     and z-directions) to each of the three B field components. The permeability
     of a magnetically biased magnetic material is:

       µxx µxy µxz                                 µ0 0 0  

     [µ] =  µyx µyy µyz  =  0 µ   .                          (5.7)

       µzx µzy µzz                                 0 - µ

     This tensor can take other forms depending on the orientation of the time-
     varying magnetic field to the DC biasing magnetic field.

        The effect on propagation of an EM field is shown in Figure 5-16. When the
     EM field is in the magnetized magnetic material, the wave does not travel in
     a straight line and instead curves, in this case, to the right. Thus forward-
     and backward-traveling waves diverge from each other and propagation is
     not reciprocal. This can be used to separate forward- and backward-traveling
     waves. This is called field displacement.

5.5.2 Circulator

A circulator exploits the gyromagnetic effect through field displacement
[18-20]. The schematic of a circulator is shown in Figure 5-17(a), where the
arrows indicate that the signal that enters Port 1 of the circulator leaves the
circulator at Port 2 and not at Port 3. Similarly power that enters at Port 2 is
routed to Port 3, and power entering at Port 3 is routed to Port 1. In terms of
S parameters, an ideal circulator has the scattering matrix

                          0 0 S13    001  

S =  S21 0 0  =  1 0 0  .                   (5.8)

                          0 S32 0    010

A microstrip circulator is shown in Figure 5-17(b), where a disc of
magnetized ferrite can be placed on top of a microstrip Y junction to realize
a preferential direction of propagation of the EM fields [22]. Design requires
choice of the size of the ferrite disc and design of the appropriate magnetic
biasing field. In the absence of the biasing magnetic field, the circulation
function does not occur.

   In addition to the insertion and return losses, the performance of a
circulator is described by its isolation, which is its insertion loss in the
undesired direction.

5.5.3 Circulator Isolation

The isolation of a circulator is the insertion loss from what is the output port
to the input port, i.e. in the reverse direction. Referring to the circulator in
Figure 5-17(a), if port 1 is the input port there are two output ports and so
there are two isolations equal to the return loss from port 3 to port 2, and
from port 2 to port 1. The smaller of these is the isolation quoted if only one
value is given. If this was an ideal circulator and port 2 is perfectly matched,
then the isolation would be infinite. If port 2 is not perfectly matched then
there will be finite isolation from port 3 to port 1. However the most common
source of limited isolation is when the circulator is not perfectly matched.
Consider that the reflection coefficient looking into each of the circulator's
ports is  and if the circulator is well designed   1. Then the S parameters
180                         STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     of the circulator are

                              T

                            S= T                 (5.9)

                            T 

     where T is the transmission factor and is close to 1 for a good circulator and
     the leakage, , is small. If the circulator is lossless then the unitary conditions,
     from Equations (2.148) and (2.149) of [23], are

       |T |2 + || + ||2 = 1                      (5.10)
      + T  + T  = 0 -  + T (/) + T (/) = 0       (5.11)

     Since  is small  is negligibly small, so Equation (5.11) indicates that
     || = ||. Then from Equation (5.10), |T |2 = 1 - 2||2, and the S parameters

     of the lossless slightly-mismatched circulator can be written

                                      1 - 2||2 
              
                                        .        (5.12)
     S =  1 - 2||2          1 - 2||2
                                      
                    

     Thus even with ideal external matching at port 2, the isolation is 1/. The
     quality of the match of a microwave component is typically specified by its
     VSWR at the ports. Thus the VSWR of a circulator indicates the isolation
     that can be expected. Actual circulators have a small amount of loss so the
     isolation and VSWR quoted for a circulator will not conform exactly to the
     lossless situation considered here.

     5.5.4 Isolator

     Isolators are devices that allow power flow in only one direction. There
     are two types, one based on field displacement and the other based on
     gyromagnetic resonance. Ferrite isolators exploiting field displacement are
     based on a three-port circulator with one of the ports terminated in a
     matched load. Figure 5-17(c) shows a microstrip isolator based on a three-
     port circulator. The puck at the center is a magnetic material such as ferrite
     that when magnetized by a permanent magnet or electromagnet (which is
     not shown) preferentially supports a counter-clockwise rotating EM wave.
     So power entering Port 1 as a traveling wave is transferred to the ferrite and
     emerges at Port 2. Virtually none of the power emerges at Port 3. A traveling
     wave signal applied at Port 2 appears at Port 3, where it is absorbed in a
     termination created by resistive material placed on top of the microstrip. The
     resistive material forms a lossy transmission line and, provided that the lossy
     line section is long enough, no power is reflected. Thus power can travel from
     Port 1 to Port 2, but not in the reverse direction. An isolator is commonly
     used to protect the output of equipment from high reflected signals. A four-
     port version can implement a duplexer in radar systems and to separate the
     received and transmitted signals in a transceiver.

        A high-frequency microstrip isolator derived from a circulator is shown
     in Figure 5-18. The input and output lines are at the top and are redirected
     under the puck. The puck is epoxied to the microstrip substrate and a large
     biasing magnet is attached on top of the puck. The third port is at the bottom
     of the figure.

   Isolators can also exploit gyromagnetic resonance and are then called
resonance isolators. A suitable rotation of the RF magnetic field relative to
the DC magnetic bias results for one of the directions of propagation in a
rectangular waveguide. At the gyromagnetic resonance frequency, RF energy
is coupled into the lattice and RF power is absorbed for one direction of
propagation and in the other direction the RF signal is little affected.

5.5.5 YIG-Tuned Bandpass Filter

The gyromagnetic effect also enables very sharp variable bandpass filters.
A Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG)-tuned filter is shown in Figure 5-17(d) and
the result is that Ports 1 and 2 are only coupled at a precise frequency
determined by the state of magnetization of the YIG sphere. With an
electromagnet providing a DC magnetic field, the magnetic field can be
varied and the resonance frequency, and hence the bandpass frequency,
electronically tuned. Microwave spectrum analyzers often use a YIG-tuned
filter at the input of the analyzer.

5.6 Summary

The use of modules has become increasingly important in microwave
engineering. A wide variety of passive modules were introduced but there
are many more. Some microwave modules use unusual effects such as the
response of magnetic materials to magnetic fields. Many others use the
characteristics of propagating EM fields. The next chapter completes the
discussion of modules by covering active modules. A successful microwave
designer must have a good knowledge of the types and limitations of
available modules.

6.1 Introduction

This chapter considers frequency generation and frequency translation
modules. In a receiver the basic frequency translation module is a mixer that
is used in a receiver to take a signal at a high frequency to a low frequency,
the baseband signal, where it can be more easily sampled by an analog-to-
digital converter (ADC) and then digitally processed. In a transmitter the
signal flow is reversed and a low frequency baseband signal is translated
to a high-frequency signal where it can be more easily transmitted. A local
oscillator (LO) is input to the mixer to provide the translation mechanism
by varying the impedance of an element at the LO frequency. A voltage-
controlled oscillator (VCO) allows for agility of the oscillator. A VCO with
a phase detector embedded in a phase-locked loop (PLL) provides a well-
defined variable frequency oscillation signal. Special RF signal sources are
based either on special characteristics of certain semiconductor devices or on
vacuum devices in which a beam of electrons interacts with an RF field in a
controlled way. These sources produce very high RF powers up to several
megawatts or substantial power at very high frequencies, up to several
terahertz.

     6.2 Mixer

     Frequency conversion, mixing or heterodyning, is the process of converting
     information at one frequency (present in the form of a modulated carrier)
     to another frequency. The second frequency is either higher, in the case
     of frequency up-conversion, where it is more easily transmitted, or lower,
     when mixing is called frequency down-conversion, where it is more easily
     captured. The mixer types are shown in Figure 6-1. Capture of the down-
     converted signal is nearly always by an ADC. Frequency conversion can
     occur with any nonlinear element.

        Consider the information signal flow in the down-converter in Figure 6-
     1(a). (A similar discussion applies to the up-converter in Figure 6-1(b).) From
     the left, a modulated RF signal centered at fRF is presented to a mixer that
     is pumped by a large LO signal at fLO. The intended function of the mixer
     is to convert the information on the modulated RF to a lower intermediate
     frequency (IF) centered at fIF = |fRF - fLO|. The spectrum of the mixer,
     shown on the right on Figure 6-1(a), has another tone, fIM called the image
     tone. The image at fIM is an interferer, as it is also down-converted to the IF
     since fIF = |fIM - fLO|. Noise at the image is also down-converted to the IF.
     For the up-converter the high-power noise coming from the power amplifier
     at the image would be transmitted. Mixer design therefore must consider
     how image and noise are handled, as well as the efficiency of the conversion
     process.

        In Figure 6-2(a) a nonlinear device is driven by two signals at M and
     C. The larger signal, the LO, is also called the pump and the other signal
     is called the RF. The spectrum of the signals present in the circuit is
     shown in Figure 6-2(c). In this mixer the aim is to produce a signal at the
     difference frequency (or IF) with the same modulation, and hence the same
     information, as the original RF signal. The transistor mixer shown in Figure
     6-3 uses filtering to separate the RF, LO, and IF components.

6.2.1 Mixer Analysis

A mixer can be designed around any nonlinear device [1]. Using an

operational amplifier, an ideal multiplier can be designed that will multiply

two signals, each described as cosinusoids. If the LO cosinusoid is cos(1t)

and the input RF cosinusoid is cos(2t), the multiplication of the two signals

will produce an output (using the trigonometric identity cos(A) cos(B) =
1
2  [cos(A  -  B  )  +  cos(A  +  B  )]):

                       y(t) = [cos(1t)] · [cos(2t)]

                       =      1  {cos[(1  -  2)t]  +  cos[(1  +  2)t]} .   (6.1)
                              2

This has two components: one at the radian frequency (1 - 2) and the
other at (1 + 2). If the LO and RF signal are close, then the component
at (1 - 2) will be at a frequency much lower than either the LO or
the RF, and the component at (1 + 2) will be at almost twice the input
frequencies. Appropriate filtering will choose one of these components
depending on whether the application is up-conversion or down-conversion.
At microwave frequencies, circuits that do not realize ideal multiplication
must be used. This section considers what happens when two components
are applied to an arbitrary nonlinearity described by a low-order polynomial.
The result is that a large number of tones will be generated in the mixing
process. Balanced circuit designs can significantly reduce many of these
tones, greatly reducing the filtering required to select a particular output.

   A two-tone input

                       x(t) = |X1| cos(1t + 1) + |X2| cos(2t + 2)
188                   STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     can be written using complex notation as

                   1      1t        -1t                2t        -2t
        x(t) = 2 X1e + X1 e                    + X2e + X2 e                 .

     Note that the coefficient of the positive exponential frequency component is

     one-half that of the phasor. Thus the phasor of the 1 component is X1 =
     |X1|e(1) and the phasor of the 2 component is X2 = |X2|e(2). The first

     three powers of x can be easily expanded manually; for example, expanding
     x2 gives

        + (X1 ) e      + 2X1 X2e                   + 2X1 X2 e               + X2 e

     and similarly, expanding x3 yields

     so that the output of the cubic equation,
                              y(t) = a0 + a1x(t) + a2x2(t) + a3x3(t),

     can be calculated for a two-tone input. Table 6-1 lists these phasors and

     groups them by frequency. A more general approach is described in [2].
        The phasors of the various intermodulation products resulting from x, x2,

     and x3 can be taken as the coefficients of the positive exponential frequency

     components after the factor of two correction required for terms other than

     DC [2]. Terms of the same frequency are summed to obtain the output at a
     particular frequency. For example, the phasor output at (21 - 2) is given
     by the sum of three intermodulation products:

                                                        3 2                         (6.4)

                          Y(21-2) = a3 4 X1 X2 .

        So the level of the output of a mixer, here Y(21-2) at radian frequency
     (21 - 2), is related directly to the strength of the LO signal (with amplitude
     |X1|), the strength of the nonlinearity (captured by the an coefficients),
     and the level of the input signal |X2|. Unfortunately, low-order power
     series analysis as used here is not sufficient to model practical mixers, and

     computer-aided modeling tools are necessary. However, the manual analysis
     enables operation to be understood and architectures to be developed that

     intrinsically have the desired characteristics.

6.2.2 Mixer Performance Parameters

The main characteristics that define the performance of a mixer are the
conversion gain or loss, and the noise figure [3, 4]. Mixing results from a
nonlinear process that generates many tones and not just the ones of interest.
Consequently, additional parameters are used to describe the performance
of a mixer, and these derive from the generation of the additional tones. The
mixer performance parameters are as follows:

Conversion loss: This is the ratio of the available power of the input signal
to that of the output signal after mixing. It is usually expressed in decibels.
In the diode mixer shown in Figure 6-5, the conversion loss is

                           LC = Pin(RF) .               (6.5)
                                   Pout(IF)

In decibels, the conversion loss is

                 LC |dB = 10 log10 Pin(RF) P . out(IF)  (6.6)

Noise figure (NF): The NF is 10 times the log of the noise factor F . The noise
factor is the ratio of the SNR at the RF input to the SNR at the IF output (using
the input noise generated by a resistor at standard temperature, 290 K).
190                             STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     However, there are qualifications for mixers. The first is that two inputs (at
     the RF and image frequencies) can produce noise and signal power at the IF.
     The double-sideband (DSB) NF includes signal and noise contributions from
     both the RF and the image frequencies. This is the situation with radiometry
     and astronomy, where the signal is at both sidebands. Single-sideband (SSB)
     NF includes the input signal at the RF only, but includes noise originating at
     both the RF and at the image frequencies. This is the situation for mixers in
     communications where the signal is only at one sideband.

        Mixers can have substantial excess noise, as noise that is offset in frequency
     from the LO and its harmonics by the magnitude of the IF frequency will be
     down-converted to the IF for a down-converter, or converted to the RF in an
     up-converter. This process is sometimes called noise folding.

        In summary, two noise figures are used with mixers, SSB NF and DSB NF.
     Which to use depends on the system in which the mixer is embedded.

     Image rejection: If a mixer has an LO of 1.1 GHz and an RF of 1.5 GHz, then
     the IF will be at 400 MHz. This IF can also be generated by the image signal at
     700 MHz. Numerically the image is the reflection of the RF in the LO. Image
     rejection refers to the ability of a mixer to reject the image signal. This can be
     achieved, for example, by using an input RF bandpass filter.

        If the applied image and intended signal powers are the same and the level
     of the output signal (at the IF) produced by the intended RF signal is Pout,
     and that produced by the image signal is Pout,image, then the image rejection
     ratio (IRR) is

                                            IRR = Pout .                                          (6.7)
                                                     Pout,image

     This is typically expressed in decibels and

                                IRR|dB = 10 log10 Pout P . out,image                              (6.8)

EXAMPLE 6.1 Mixer Calculations

     A mixer has an LO of 10 GHz. The mixer is used to convert a signal at 10.1 GHz to an IF at
     100 MHz, and has a conversion loss, Lc of 3 dB and an image rejection of 20 dB. Two signals
     are presented to the mixer, one at 10.1 GHz with a power of 100 nW and the other at 9.9 GHz
     with a power of 1 µW.

     (a) What is the output power of the (intended) signal at the IF?
     (b) What is the signal-to-interference ratio at the IF (ignoring noise)?

     Solution:

     (a) Lc = 3 dB = 2 and from Equation (6.5) the output power at IF of the intended signal is

                      Pout = Pin(RF)/Lc = 100 nW/2 = 50 nW = -43 dBm.    (6.9)

     (b) Interference at the IF comes from the down-converted image signal. IRR = 20 dB = 100.

     If the applied powers of the intended signal and the image signal are the same, from

     Equation (6.7),

                      IRR = Pout            i.e. Pout,image = Pout       (6.10)
                                Pout,image                          IRR
MIXER AND SOURCE MODULES                                                                   191

This must be modified to account for the difference in the applied power levels and

Pout,image = Pout Pin(RF, image) = (50 nW) · (1 µW) = (50 nW) · (1000 nW) = 5 nW.
IRR Pin(RF)                          100 · (100 nW)  100 · (100 nW)

The signal-to-interference ratio is

                       SIR = Pout = 50 nw = 10 = 10 dB.                            (6.11)

6.2.3 Mixer Waveforms

This section presents the waveforms of diode mixers. Diode mixers, such
as the balanced mixer in Figure 6-4, are bilateral. In a communication
transceiver such a mixer can be used for both the receive and transmit
functions, greatly simplifying filtering requirements. Most mixers in cell
phones, however, are based on transistors, but the underlying architecture
corresponds to a single-diode mixer or, more commonly, the diode ring
double-balanced mixer.

   The first mixer to be considered is the single-ended mixer shown in Figure
6-5(a). Filters are not included thus revealing the full complexity of the
spectra. The transient waveform across the diode (measured at the test point)
is shown in Figure 6-5(b). The turn-on transient is due to both the turn-on
ramp of the LO and RF sources, and to the internal capacitance of the diode.
The spectra of the signal at the test point is shown in Figure 6-5(c and d).
The desired signal here is the IF, which is at the difference frequency of the
LO and RF (i.e., at 400 MHz). Extracting just the IF in the response shown in
Figure 6-5(d) would require significant filtering. The level of the IF tone here
is 11.5 mVpeak. If a lossless 400 MHz filter is attached to the test point and
the IF load (on the other side of the filter) is 50 , the IF power delivered to
the load is Pout = 12 (11.5 mV)2/(50 ) = 1.322 µW. The available RF power
is Pin = 12 (100 mV)2/(50 ) = 100 µW. So the conversion loss is

LC = 100 µW = 75.08 = 18.8 dB.                           (6.12)
        1.332 µW

   Now consider the diode ring mixer shown in Figure 6-6. Waveforms and
spectra at the LO, IF, and RF test points are shown in Figure 6-7. Note how
relatively clean the spectra are at each of the test points. The reduction in
clutter is the result of the balanced circuit. The circuit in Figure 6-6 is known
as a double-balanced mixer, and the same concept can be used with transistor
mixers.

   Focusing on just the spectra at the IF test point (Figure 6-7(e)), it can be
seen that the LO signal and its harmonics are nonexistent. The components
other than the 400 MHz IF are other sum and difference products of the RF
and LO. However, compared to the spectra of the single-ended diode mixer

                          Figure 6-4: Diode ring double-
                          balanced mixer.

             in Figure 6-5(c and d), many of these are eliminated as well. This is a very

             attractive circuit, as it significantly reduces the specifications required for an

             output filter. This is one of the special characteristics of RF and microwave

             design. Much can be gained by being creative--a designer gets better with

             experience. The level of the IF signal at the RF test point is 26.7 mVpeak. The IF
                                                               1         mV)2/(50
             power delivered to the 50       load  is Pout  =  2  (26.7            )  =  7.126  µW.

             The available RF power is Pin   =     1  (100  mV)2/(50     )  =  100 µW. So the
                                                   2
             conversion loss is

                                 LC = 100 µW = 14.03 = 11.47 dB.                            (6.13)
                                         7.126 µW

             The conversion loss is much lower than was obtained with the single-ended
             mixer. In part this is because power was not dissipated in a large number of
             spurious tones.

     6.2.4 Switching Mixer

     The analysis of a mixer in Section 6.2.1 modeled the mixing element using
     a polynomial. With a large LO, an alternative view of a mixer is to consider
     it as a switching device in which the conductance of the mixing element is
     periodically switched by the LO.

        A simple switching diode mixer is shown in Figure 6-8(a). If the LO level
     is large, then the mixer can be modeled by the equivalent circuit shown
     in Figure 6-8(b) with a periodically varying conductance, gLO(t). This is
     a square wave with the same frequency and period as the applied LO
     sinewave. The diode effectively looks like a switch with the conductance
     alternating between a maximum value gm and zero (see Figure 6-8(c)). The
     first few terms of the Fourier series expansion of gLO(t) are

                      gLO(t) = gm 1 + 1 cos(LOt) + 2 cos(3LOt) + . . . .    (6.14)
                      2                     3

     The small RF signal interacts with the switching conductance so that the
     output current is

                      i(t) = gLO(t) [vRF - ix(t)R] .                        (6.15)

     Ignoring R, then the IF current, where IF = RF - LO, at the point x is

                      iIF(t) = gLO(t)vRF(t) = gm cos(LOt)vRF cos(RFt)       (6.16)
                                                       

                             = gmvRF {cos[(LO - RF)t] + cos[(LO + RF)t]} .
                                    2

     Typically the IF signal at (LO -RF) would be extracted through a bandpass
     or lowpass filter that allows only the IF component to pass and an IF voltage
     is realized as the current passes through a load resistor.

        One of the advantages of the switching mixer is that performance is
     relatively insensitive to the level of the LO. The LO could be a sinewave and
     still the variation of the conductance would be close to being a square wave.
     So then the design of the mixer specifically is to develop a square variation
     of the conductance.

        Switching mixers can be realized using other circuits. One of these is the
     diode ring mixer shown in Figure 6-9. Here the center-tapped transformers
     produce differential LO and RF signals. The large LO is transformed by the
     tapped transformer to produce a large differential signal that turns pairs
     of diodes on in sequence. During the positive half of the LO cycle, the

two right-hand diodes in Figure 6-9(a) pass current limited by the source
impedance of the LO source and each diode has a conductance 2gm, as
seen in Figure 6-9(b). During the negative half-cycle of the LO, the left-
hand diodes pass current and each has conductance 2gm, see Figure 6-9(c
and d). When not forward biased, the diodes appear as open circuits. This
process results in the conductance waveform shown in Figure 6-9(e). An
important characteristic of this waveform is that it is symmetrical even when
nonidealities are considered.

   An RF implementation of the diode mixer is shown in Figure 6-10. The
180 hybrid replaces the transformer to distribute oppositely phased RF
signals to the diode ring. The IF is now taken from the center tap of the LO
transformer and is passed through a lowpass filter to remove all signals other
than the IF. This is a down-converting mixer. If the mixer is an up-converting
mixer, then the lowpass filter would be replaced by a bandpass filter.

   Transistor-based mixer implementations using the ring mixer concept are
shown in Figure 6-11. These circuits are used in monolithic ICs with the
differential signals available from preceding stages and the IF output is also
differential. The transistors operate as switches that are controlled by the LO
signal and the conductance waveform is as for the diode mixer (i.e., as in
Figure 6-9(e)). Another switching mixer is the transistor commutating mixer
shown in Figure 6-12.

   Traditionally the the biggest issue with switching mixers was is the
substantial LO power required and the limited dynamic range of the mixer in

     converting RF to IF (for a down-converter) or IF to RF (for an up-converter).
     This situation changes with the 32 nm and lower CMOS processing nodes.
     This has resulted in CMOS switching mixers being important elements of
     RFICs and these have superior dynamic range.

     6.2.5 Subharmonic Mixer

     If the nonlinear element of a mixer is particularly strong, or perhaps the drive
     level is very high, mixing will occur when the frequency of the LO drive of
     the mixer is a subharmonic of the the effective LO frequency. Consider the
     switching mixers discussed in Section 6.2.4 and the switching conductance,
     Figure 6-12(c), of the commutating mixer in Figure 6-12(a). With this mixer
     the RF signal effectively mixes with an harmonic of the applied LO. Here
     these harmonics are odd harmonics and so a commutating mixer driven by
     an LO signal at 5 GHz will down-convert and RF signal at 15.1 MHz to an
     IF frequency of 100 MHz. One of the advantages of a subharmoinic mixer
     is that there is not a large 15 GHz signal which could be a problem as it
     could leak into the front of a receiver and possibly radiate unintentionally.
     Another advantage is that with a conventional down-conversion mixing
     approach where the LO and RF are close in frequency, an LO at 15 GHz, in
     previous example, would need to be generated from the 5 GHz signal. This
     would consume considerable power. So it could be more power efficient to
     use a subharmonic mixer rather than a frequency tripler and a conventional
     mixer. A subharmonic mixer could be the preferred design option especially
     for down-converting millimeter-wave signals. At high millimeter-wave
     frequencies (e.g. > 200 GHz) the mixer is often a passive nonlinear element.
MIXER AND SOURCE MODULES                                                          197

6.3 Single-Ended, Balanced, and Double Balanced Mixers

Single-ended, balanced, and double-balanced diode mixers are shown in
Figure 6-13. The simplest type of mixer that has been considered is the
single-ended or unbalanced diode mixer of Figure 6-2(a). This is shown as
a down-converting mixer where the RF signal at fRF mixes with the LO at
fLO to produce a down-converted IF signal at fLO - fRF. The image signal
at fLO + (fLO - fRF) = 2fLO - fRF will be down-converted to the same
IF signal. It is of course not desirable to down-convert the image signal
and it could be prevented by using filtering as shown, but the use of filters
makes the filter quite large. There are many spurious frequencies with the
single-ended mixer as seen in Figure 6-5. Most of these can be removed with
filtering but using filters is undesirable and certainly not compatible with on-
chip implementations. The solution is to use symmetry to cancel out many
of the spurious tones. Figure 6-13(b and c) shows two types of symmetry,
balanced and double balanced mixers. Another level of symmetry could be
used (applying it to the IF) in the double balanced mixer and then it could be
called a triple balanced mixer. The triple balanced mixers is nearly always
referred to as a double-balanced mixer. One cannot say whether a mixer is
balanced, or even double balanced without tracing through the cancellation
process. With each increasing degree of symmetry greater linearity of the
conversion process is obtained. The double balanced mixer in FET form
is particularly attractive as the FETs do not need to be biased. Except at
very high millimeter-wave frequencies and terahertz frequencies, all mixers
today are of the double or triple balanced form. However there can be
unintentional mixing so the unbalanced mixer should be studied so that
unwanted mixing can be identified.

6.3.1 RFIC Mixers

RFIC mixers below millimeter-wave frequencies utilize the transistor as a
switch either with finite conductance when the switch closed and virtually
zero conductance when the switch is open. The first mixer to be considered
is based on the commutating mixer shown in Figure 6-12.

     (a) Gilbert cell  (b) + LO model  (c) - LO model

Figure 6-14: Model of the Gilbert cell and equivalent circuit models. The circuit is used as a mixer
where vy is the LO and vx is the RF. (This is referred to as a double balanced mixer but strictly
it is a triple balanced mixer as there are RF, IF, and LO symmetries resulting in a high level of
cancellation of spurious tones.)

     6.3.2 Gilbert Cell

     The Gilbert cell builds on the commutating mixer circuit of Figure 6-12. The
     commutating mixer conducts current in the IF leg (with RIF during only half
     of the LO waveform. An immediate improvement is obtained by modifying
     the circuit to provide switched conductance during both halves of the LO
     waveform. Also, the RF and IF in the commutating mixer are single-ended
     quantities whereas with a silicon IC differential signals are preferred. The
     simplest Gilbert cell is shown in Figure 6-14(a), which has all of the desired
     properties. M2 and M3 are designed as a differential amplifier pair with M4
     and M5 functioning as time-varying loads for M2, and M6 and M7 function as
     time-varying loads for M3. This leads to the equivalent model of the Gilbert
     cell shown in Figures 6-14(b and c).

        The Gilbert cell is not always used as a mixer. If both vy and vx are small
     signals, then the Gilbert cell becomes a good analog multiplier with the
     output vo = vx × vy. When used as a mixer, vy is a large LO and the Gilbert
     cell is referred to as a Gilbert mixer. The Gilbert mixer is the functional core
     of virtually every integrated mixer, especially in CMOS technology where
     differential operation is preferred.

     6.3.3 Integrated Gilbert Cell-Based Mixer

     The performance of a Gilbert mixer is improved by replacing the source
     resistor, RS, of M2 and M3 in the basic Gilbert cell of Figure 6-12 with
     a current source, as shown in Figure 6-15(a). This is the most common
     variation of the Gilbert mixer used in RFICs. A double-balanced Gilbert cell
     mixer is shown in Figure 6-15(a). When the LO is small, the Gilbert mixer

matched very well. When the LO is sufficiently large to produce a switching
conductance, there is much greater tolerance to imperfect matching. This
circuit has good performance and rejects RF and LO feed-through to the
output, and the degree of rejection is dependent on the quality of the
transistor match.

   Before continuing the discussion the gross characteristics of a transistor
circuit will be introduced. The simplest transistor circuit is the amplifier
shown in Figure 6-16(a). With an RF input signal, the large capacitor at
200  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     the gate of the transistor becomes a short circuit and the trajectory of the
     transistor's voltages and currents follows a load line as shown in Figure 6-
     16(b). In the form of a transfer function, the characteristic of the amplifier is
     as shown in Figure 6-16(c). This type of characteristic is typical of transistor
     circuits with the saturation levels of the output voltage set by the supply
     voltage and ground. The characteristic shown in Figure 6-16(c) closely
     resembles the trigonometric tanh function and so the characteristic of a
     transistor circuit is often said to be tanh-like. A tanh-like response is also
     obtained with a Gilbert mixer circuit.

        One problem with the Gilbert mixer circuit of Figure 6-15(a) is the reduced
     voltage swing resulting from three drain-source voltage drops between the
     supply rails. The classic technique for solving this problem is to use a folded
     cascode design. The folded Gilbert cell double-balanced mixer then becomes
     the circuit of Figure 6-15(b) [6, 7]. This merges a cascode amplifier design
     with the double-balanced Gilbert cell mixer in Figure 6-15(a). The result is a
     mixer that can have a larger voltage swing.

        Gilbert mixers, as enhanced so far, can have poor linearity in the sense
     that the IF output is linear only for small RF input signals. This problem is
     exasperated by the trend to reduce the supply voltage of integrated circuits.
     The solution used is to replace each of the amplifying transistors (M2 and
     M3 in Figures 6-15(a and b)) by multiple transistors with progressively
     offset biasing that staggers the tanh-like transfer characteristic of a transistor
     circuit to realize an effective transistor with more linear characteristics [6, 8].
     This design is used in the up-converting mixer shown in Figure 6-17, of
     a WCDMA transmitter RFIC. and the variation in biasing of the multiple
     amplifying transistors is achieved using sizing of each of the current source
     transistors in the bottom row. Alternatively, separate bias could be applied to
     each current source transistor. Also, the double-balanced Gilbert cell mixer
     in Figure 6-15(a) is duplicated to realize a quadrature mixer.

        The CMOS mixer has evolved from the core concept based on the diode
     ring mixer, first replacing the diodes by transistors, and then introducing
     transistor structures that cope with limited voltage supply and transistor
     nonidealities. This process is the essence of RF integrated circuit design.

     Diode ring mixers were discussed in Section 6.2.4 and circuit implementa-

     6.4 Local Oscillator

     In this section the local oscillator that is used to drive a mixer will be treated
     as a black box. The detailed design of oscillators is considered in Chapter 5
     of [9].

     6.4.1 Phase Noise in Local Oscillators

     This section builds on the discussion of noise in Section 4.2. The performance
     of most RF and microwave systems is limited by oscillator noise. In an
     oscillator the noise close to the carrier, or oscillation frequency, is called
     flicker noise and it significantly affects system performance. (In RF amplifiers
     flicker noise is generated but it is of much less concern than it is with
     oscillators.) Noise close to the oscillation center frequency (tens of hertz to
     a few megahertz away for RF and microwave oscillators) manifests itself as
     random fluctuations of amplitude and phase of the carrier. The amplitude
     fluctuations are quenched by saturation in the oscillator and so are not of
     concern. Thus the important close-in noise is just phase noise. This phase
     noise increases the smaller frequency offset from the oscillation frequency.

        The main use of an LO is to drive a mixer. Then phase noise on the LO
     is added to the phase of the signal converted by the mixer and so the LO
     phase noise becomes phase noise on the converted signal. In a digitally
     modulated communication system the components of the phase noise at the
     symbol rate and down to a few of its subharmonics have the most impact
     on the ability to demodulate signals. Phase noise outside the bandwidth of
MIXER AND SOURCE MODULES                                                           203

the communication signal can be filtered out. Also phase noise slower than
a few subharmonics below the symbol rate are compensated for in signal
processing (e.g., using error correction codes).

   Most RF oscillators comprise free-running oscillators whose oscillation
frequency can be controlled by an applied DC or low-frequency voltage.
Superior performance is obtained by comparing a scaled down version of
an oscillator output to a high-precision reference oscillator such as a crystal
oscillator. Without the feedback the oscillator is said to be an open-loop
oscillator, and with feedback it is said to be a closed-loop oscillator.

   For a free-running oscillator (i.e., an open-loop oscillator), the phase noise
close to the carrier (i.e. the average oscillation frequency) is dominated by
flicker phase noise, as shown in Figure 6-19(a). This describes the intrinsic
noise property of the active device (and surrounding circuitry) and the white
noise and flicker noise responses are clearly seen. When the loop is closed,
the loop transfer characteristic shapes the noise response, producing noise
that has regions close to the carrier that has a 1/fm3 shape, and further
from the carrier it varies as 1/fm2 if the Q of the loop is low [10]. The
switch from 1/fm3 to 1/fm2 dependence is at what is called the transition
or crossover frequency, fc (see Figure 6-19(b)). If the Q of the loop is high,
the phase noise profile will transition from the 1/fm3 regime directly to the
204  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     Figure 6-20: Voltage-   (a) Schematic      (b) Tuning curve
     controlled oscillator.

     1/fm regime, and again the transition frequency is fc (see Figure 6-19(c)).
     The transition frequency is usually around a few kilohertz to hundreds

     of kilohertz offset from the carrier for microwave transistors. A feedback
     analysis that describes how 1/f and white noise are converted to the 1/fm3 ,
     1/fm2 , or 1/fm characteristics was developed by Leeson in 1966 [10] and
     others [11]. An advanced discussion of oscillator phase noise is given in

     Section 5.8 of [9] and the discussion here is limited but sufficient when

     using oscillators as modules. Here the traditional but approximate approach

     developed by Leeson is followed.

        Phase noise was formally defined in Equation (4.60) and roughly it is the

     ratio of the phase noise power in a 1 Hz bandwidth of a single sideband (SSB)
     to the total signal power. This is measured at a frequency fm offset from the
     carrier and denoted L(fm) with the units of dBc/Hz (i.e., decibels relative to
     the carrier power per hertz).

        The phase noise that is important in RF and microwave oscillators (having
     relatively low Q) is usually dominated by a 1/fm2 shape. Then the phase noise
     at 1 MHz (a common frequency for comparing the phase noise performance
     of different oscillators) is related to the phase noise measured at fm by

     L(1 MHz) = L(fm) - 10 log              1 MHz 2  .     (6.17)

                                            fm

        Another commonly used quantitative assessment of oscillator perfor-
     mance is provided by the oscillator figure of merit, FOM1, which accounts
     for the DC power consumed [12]:

     FOM 1 MHz 2 P 1 = L(fm) - 10 log + 10 log DC ,        (6.18)
                             fm                      Pref

     where Pref is conventionally taken as 1 mW and FOM1 is referenced to the
     phase noise at 1 MHz.

     6.5 Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)

     As its name implies, a controlling voltage sets the frequency of the output of a
     VCO. The block diagram of a VCO is shown in Figure 6-20(a) where a slowly
     varying input signal, vi, determines the frequency, f0, of the signal produced
     by an oscillator. This is usually achieved by varying the capacitance of a
     varactor diode in a resonator.

        One of the important characteristics of a VCO is the tuning curve, which
     plots the output frequency f0 against the applied tuning voltage vi as shown
     in Figure 6-20(b). Ideally the tuning curve is a straight line, but in practice it is
     shaped and the actual range over which the VCO is used is less than the full
     range supported. The tuning property is described by the tuning constant,
MIXER AND SOURCE MODULES                                                           205

Table 6-2: Comparison of RF VCOs. Phase noise is worst case over tuning range; RF output

power is the minimum. All oscillators are hybrids unless indicated by IC, denoting an integrated
circuit. If fm is not 1 MHz, then a 1/f 2 dependence is assumed for the phase noise to calculate
the phase noise at 1 MHz. The CMOS VCOs are quadrature VCOs producing two outputs 90

apart. After [13] with corrected FOM1. (Pref = 1 mW, fref = 1 MHz.)

frequency for a change in control voltage. For the VCO in Figure 6-20,

   The performance of a microwave VCO is one of the most competitive
aspects of RF design, as every decibel reduction in phase noise greatly
increases overall system performance. A high-performance VCO also relaxes
demands on other system components. While FOM1 (see Equation (6.18))
serves as a useful metric to compare VCOs, another FOM with bandwidth
weighting provides a better comparison of the performance of different
VCOs. This second figure of merit is [13]

where fBW is the tuning bandwidth and fref is the reference bandwidth, taken
here as 1 MHz. Again the phase noise is referenced to 1 MHz. A number
of high-performance microwave oscillators are compared in Table 6-2. The
best phase noise that can typically be achieved by VCOs operating in the 1-
10 GHz range is -130 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz. This compares to the phase noise
component of white noise at standard temperature, which was shown in
Section 4.2.2 to be -177 dBc/Hz.

and (c) analog phase detector using a multiplier and filtering (not shown).

     6.6 Phase Detector

     A phase detector, also called a phase comparator, compares two waveforms
     and the output of the phase detector is a representation of the phase
     difference of the signals. There are two basic types of phase detectors:
     sinusoidal phase detectors and square signal phase detectors, which operate
     either in binary mode or by detecting zero crossings. The block diagram of a
     phase detector is shown in Figure 6-21(a) with the output y(t) related to the
     difference of the phase of the input signals x(t) and w(t)

        A square wave detector is based on a logic circuit producing a signal that
     is averaged (or integrated) over time. An example is the XOR gate shown
     in Figure 6-21(b), which compares two digital signals that here have the
     same frequency but are shifted in phase. The output of the XOR gate, y(t),
     is also a pulse train, and the average value of y(t) is proportional to the
     phase difference of x(t) and w(t). This average value can be obtained by
     passing y(t) through a lowpass filter to obtain a DC value. If x(t) and w(t)
     have different but close frequencies, the output of the lowpass filter will
     be a slowly varying signal. This circuit could be used to detect the phase
     difference of analog signals, but the signals first need to be converted to
     digital signals. This can be obtained through saturating amplification of the
     signals or by circuitry that responds to zero-crossings and produces a binary
     signal. Other digital phase comparators can be realized using charge-pumps,
     flip-flops, and sample-and-hold circuits.

        Sinusoidal phase detectors can use a mixer or an analog multiplier, as
     shown in Figure 6-21(c). The inputs could be two sinusoids with one of them
     adjusted in phase either externally or within the detector itself. So consider
     the inputs to the phase detector to be

          x(t) = Ax sin(xt + x) and w(t) = Aw cos(wt + w).  (6.21)

     Then the output of the multiplier is

          y(t) = Ax sin(xt + x)Aw cos(wt + w)
               = 12 AxAw [sin(xt + wt + x + w) + sin(xt - wt + x - w)] .
                                                                                                    (6.22)

     Typically the frequencies of the two input signals are close so that x =
      + 12  and w =  - 12 , where  is small and in most phase detector
     applications either  = 0 or a feedback loop attempts to set  to zero so
     there is little frequency error. So, following lowpass filtering, the output of
MIXER AND SOURCE MODULES                                                                        207

the phase detector is

                       y(t) = 12 AxAw sin(t + x - w).                     (6.23)

Now t can be considered to be a phase error and incorporated in effective
                                        1                           1
phases of the  input signals,  x(t)  =  2  t  +  x  and w(t)  =  -  2  t  +  w .

Then

                       y(t) = 12 AxAw sin[x(t) - w(t)].                   (6.24)

This is a functional phase detector provided that the difference in the phases
of the input signals is between -/2 and /2.

   A variation of the sinusoidal detector is called a phase-frequency detector
(PFD) which has an extended range and the effective phase difference of the
input signals can have a magnitude greater than /2 [31, 32].

   The output signal, y(t), is proportional to the amplitudes of the input
signals and to their phase difference. In practice the amplitudes of both input
signals are scaled to a constant amplitude so that the output only depends
on the phase difference.

   When a mixer is used in a phase detector, it operates much the same way
as a multiplier. With a switching mixer one of the input signals becomes
the drive of the switching part of the mixer and the other signal is the
sinusoidal drive. Now only the second input need be scaled to have a
constant amplitude.

6.7 Frequency Multiplier

There are three main types of microwave frequency multipliers. One uses
a nonlinear resistive element to generate harmonics and a bandpass filter
selects the appropriate harmonic for the output (see Figure 6-22(a)) [33]. A
second type uses a reactive element but is inherently narrow band. A third
type uses a mixer.

   An example is the diode frequency multiplier shown in Figure 6-22(b).
If unbiased, the diode conducts current only during the positive half-cycle
of the input signal, creating a voltage across the diode that is rich in
harmonics. If no external bias is applied, some of the positive voltage swing
is required to turn the diode on. This type of multiplier is referred to as a
resistive frequency multiplier. The transistor circuit in Figure 6-22(c) uses
the resistive multiplier principle to achieve frequency multiplication. Now
208                        STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     the bandpass filter is the tuned circuit in the collector leg of the amplifier.
     The transistor is biased to realize a strong nonlinearity and the base-emitter
     junction has an exponential current-voltage characteristic.

        If the input signal is

                                  x(t) = A cos(t + )                         (6.25)

     then the output at the n harmonic is

                                  y(t) = An cos(nt + n).                     (6.26)

     One of the issues with all frequency multipliers is the multiplication of the

     phase noise on the input signal. If  represents the phase noise on the original

     signal, then the phase noise of the output signal will be increased by a factor

     n. That is, even if the frequency multiplier introduces no noise of its own, the

     signal-to-noise (i.e., phase noise) ratio of a signal will be reduced by a factor

     n. The amplitude of the output signal, An, will usually be much less than

     that of the input signal unless the nonlinear circuit incorporates an amplifier.

     The increase in phase noise and power loss (without amplification) are the

     major drawbacks of using a resistive nonlinear element to produce frequency

     multiplication.

     The bandwidth of a resistive frequency multiplier is limited by the

     maximum bandwidth of a filter that will select just one harmonic at the

     output. That is, if the input signal is at 10 GHz and with 10× multiplication

     the output will be at 100 GHz. The useful fractional input bandwidth is

     1/n  =  1   of   the  input  signal,  otherwise  two  harmonics  could  appear
             10
     simultaneously in the output.

     Another type of frequency multiplier uses a reactive element such as

     the nonlinear capacitance of a reverse-biased semiconductor diode (i.e., a

     varactor diode) [34]. This mixer is called a reactive frequency multiplier or

     a parametric frequency multiplier. The nonlinear reactive element is part of

     a resonant input circuit at the input frequency and also part of a resonant

     output circuit at the output frequency. The efficiency of this type of mixer is

     higher than for a resistive mixer but the bandwidth is much lower.

     A third type of frequency multiplier uses a mixer. Some, but not all, mixers

     can be used to realize frequency multiplication by applying the same signal

     to the two input ports. The suitable mixer circuits are the balanced mixers

     but not the mixers that rely on filtering to separate LO, RF, and IF signals.

     A further type of frequency multiplier uses a phase-locked loop.

     Frequency division in the feedback loop results in frequency multiplication

     of the input signal. Yet another type uses flip-flops working on a microwave

     frequency binary clock signal and this is the type often used in modern RFICs

     to provide a square wave drive to a switching mixer.

     6.8 Frequency Divider

     A frequency divider is a module that reduces the frequency of a signal.
     There are three main types of frequency dividers: those that work with
     square waves and those that work with sinusoidal signals. The square wave
     dividers are much simpler. A divide-by-2 square wave divider is shown in
     Figure 6-23. The square wave input can be produced from a sinusoidal signal
     using zero-crossing detection or a high-gain circuit with saturating levels.

                                                                                       loop with a phase-detector
                                                                                       and a frequency divider indi-
                                                                                       cated by (1/N ).

   One type of analog frequency divider is the regenerative frequency divider
shown in Figure 6-24. The key element of this circuit is the mixer, which here
produces an output at the difference frequency of the input at frequency fi
and the signal is fed back at frequency fx. The output of the mixer is the
lowpass filtered difference of fi and fx. The loop stabilizes to produce the
divided frequency at the output.

   Another analog frequency divider, called a locked-oscillator frequency
divider, uses injection locking of an oscillator [35]. It is relatively easy to
lock many oscillators by injecting a signal near the nth harmonic of the free-
running oscillation frequency. Then the oscillation frequency shifts and the
output has a frequency 1/nth that of the input signal.

   Yet another type uses flip-flops dividing the frequency of a microwave-
frequency binary clock signal.

6.9 Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)

A phase-locked loop (PLL) is a feedback system in which the frequency and
phase of an output signal is related to the frequency and phase of an input
signal. The block diagram of a PLL is shown in Figure 6-25. An input signal
x(t) is compared to a feedback signal z(t). The frequency of y(t) will be
the average frequency of x(t). The way the loop achieves this is that the
output of the phase detector is proportional to the phase difference of x(t)
and z(t). This is then filtered by the block F (s) (generally a lowpass filter)
to produce a DC-like signal that drives a VCO. The filtering block, F (s),
removes undesired components from the phase detector and also sets the
dynamic response of the PLL.

6.9.1 Operation

The operation of the PLL in Figure 6-25 can be modeled as a linear system
with the assumption that x(t) and z(t) (= y(t) here) are nearly periodic
signals. Thus, approximately,

x(t) = Ax cos(xt + x) and z(t) = Aw cos(zt + z).  (6.27)
210  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

Figure 6-26: Linearized model of an ana-
log phase-locked loop.

     PLLs require that the radian frequency x be close to z, which is near the
     free-running frequency of the VCO. (In practice, x is usually much less than
     z and a frequency divider is used to divide the signal at z to obtain a signal
     with a frequency close to x. The analysis is similar to that presented here.)
     This defines the capture range of the PLL. Therefore Equation (6.27) can be

     written

     x(t) = Ax cos(x(t)) and z(t) = Aw cos(0(t)).                     (6.28)

     The phases x and 0 incorporate the original phases x and w,
     respectively, and the effective time-dependent phase difference due to the
     small time-dependent difference of the frequencies of x(t) and z(t). Analysis
     of the PLL in Figure 6-25 begins with the voltage at the output of the phase
     detector, v(t), which is proportional to the phase difference of the two input
     signals and independent of their amplitude:

                                          v(t) = Kd(x - 0),           (6.29)

     where Kd is the phase detector gain factor. The output of the phase detector
     is filtered by the block with transfer function F (s). Usually this block is a
     lowpass filter, but there are applications where it could be a bandpass filter
     or have some other characteristic.

        The output of the VCO is controlled by the voltage w(t) producing a signal
     with frequency

                                          f0 = fc + f = fc + K0v(t),  (6.30)

     where fc is the frequency of oscillation when the control voltage is zero and
     K0 is the VCO gain factor.

        Equations (6.29) and (6.30) describe the linear system shown in Figure 6-
     26. The transfer function of this system is

     0 = KdK0F (s)/s = G(s) ,                                         (6.31)
     x 1 + KdK0F (s)/s 1 + G(s)

     where G(s) = KdK0F (s). The phase error function is

     (s) = x(s) - 0 = x 1 - KdK0F (s) = sx(s) .                       (6.32)
                                         s + KdK0F (s) s + KdK0F (s)

     So the phase error function is directly related to the phase of the input signal
     x(t). In the next section a particular choice of the transfer function F (s) is
     used, leading to the identification of a particular PLL application.

     6.9.2 First-Order PLL

     Without a filter (i.e., F (s) = 1) the PLL is referred to as a first-order PLL or
     first-order loop and its transfer function is

     0(s) = KdK0/s = KdK0 .                                           (6.33)
     x(0) 1 + KdK0/s s + KdK0
MIXER AND SOURCE MODULES                                                          211

This seems to be the transfer function of a lowpass filter, but the input to the
system is phase and the output is the phase deviation from the free-running
frequency of the VCO. The phase error function of the first-order PLL is

(s) = x(s) - 0 = x(s) 1 - KdK0                     = sx(s) .           (6.34)
                                         s + KdK0     s + KdK0

   The steady-state response of the first-order PLL to specific input signals
will now be derived. The long-term (steady-state) behavior is developed
using the final-value theorem. A function H(s) with all poles in the left-half
plane has a time-domain response h(t) with long-term behavior given by

               lim h(t) = lim sH(s).                                   (6.35)
               t                   s0

Consider now the response to a step change, x, of the phase of the input
signal. The Laplace transform of a step function of magnitude x is x/s
and this is what is used in Equation (6.34). Thus the steady-state error
function, ss = (t) as t  , is

ss = lim        s2x(s)   = lim     s2x/s           = lim        sx
               s + KdK0            s + KdK0                  s + KdK0
           s0                s0                        s0

    = 0.                                                               (6.36)

Equation (6.36) indicates that a first-order PLL will eventually track a phase
change of the input signal. However, it will not respond immediately as the
loop has a lowpass characteristic. In effect the PLL is acting as a high-Q
bandpass filter.

   Now consider a step change in the frequency of the input signal. If the
step change in the radian frequency of x(t) is x, then the resulting phase
change will be a ramp so that, in the Laplace domain, (s) = x/s2. Then
the steady-state error is

                s2 ss = lim x/s2   = lim              x
                      s0 s + KdK0                  s + KdK0
                                       s0
                   = x/(KdK0).
                                                                       (6.37)

Equation (6.37) indicates that a first-order PLL will follow a change in
frequency with a phase error that is proportional to the magnitude of the
frequency change. So if the input signal x(t) is a frequency modulated
signal, the first-order PLL will demodulate the signal and recover the original
modulation as the error signal. Thus a first-order PLL demodulates an FM
signal, that is, it is a frequency demodulator.

6.9.3 Applications

Three applications of the PLL are shown in Figure 6-27. A frequency
synthesizer is used to create a signal locked to a fixed-frequency and very
accurate reference oscillator but at another frequency (see Figure 6-27(a)).
Typically the reference is a precision low-frequency reference oscillator, such
as a quartz crystal oscillator [36]. The output frequency is not at the same
frequency as the reference oscillator. This is accomplished by including a
frequency divider in the PLL. Normally the division factor, N , is an integer
212                        STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

using phase-locked loops.

     so that the output signal's frequency will be an integer multiple of the
     input frequency. A fractional-N frequency synthesizer is achieved using
     two integer dividers with division factors N and M . A controller alternates
     between the two division factors so that the VCO tends to output first
     one frequency and then the next. The VCO stabilizes at a frequency that
     is the weighted average of the two division factors. If the frequency is
     divided by M for a time M , then by N for time N , and repeated, then
     the effective division factor is (M M + N N )/(M + N ). The loop dynamics
     (determined by the filter F (s)) is chosen so that the VCO can only change
     more slowly than the toggling of the division factors. The division factors,
     and the toggling between its two values, are chosen to synthesize an output
     signal with the desired frequency.

        The second application of the PLL is a phase modulator, see Figure 6-27(b).
     The phase modulating signal m(t) effectively is adding to the phase error
     generated by the phase detector. This results in a change in the phase of the
     VCO output compensating for the inserted phase change.

        The third application of the PLL is the coherent amplitude demodulator
     shown in Figure 6-27(c). The input is an amplitude modulated signal

                           x(t) = A [1 + m(t)] sin(0t),        (6.38)

     which is demodulated to recover m(t) by multiplying x(t) by an LO signal
     with the same carrier frequency. The characteristic of F (s) is chosen so
     that the PLL generates the LO signal as the loop establishes the oscillation
MIXER AND SOURCE MODULES                                                               213

frequency as the central frequency of the modulated input. The loop filter
F (s) ensures that the VCO frequency cannot change too quickly and the
output frequency of the VCO approximates a sinusoidal signal having a
radian frequency 0 with a phase offset. Thus

w(t)  =  x(t)  sin(0t  +  )  =  A  [1  +  m(t)]  1  [cos    -  cos(20 t )]  .  (6.39)
                                                 2

Following lowpass filtering the output is

                       y(t) = A [1 + m(t)] cos .                               (6.40)

With loop dynamics chosen so that  is small, the original modulation, m(t),
is recovered. This AM demodulator performs well when the input SNR is
low as demodulation is coherent.

6.10 Direct Digital Synthesizer

A direct digital synthesizer (DDS) uses a DSP unit, commonly called
a numerically controlled oscillator, to create the digital version of a
modulated waveform (see Figure 6-28). The digital output of the DSP drives
a DAC that is filtered by a lowpass filter producing the analog output. A DDS
module enables a fairly complex RF system to be realized using just a few
components, as frequency generation and frequency synthesis are embodied
in one unit. The accuracy of the frequency of the analog signal is established
by the reference oscillator that acts as a precision clock for the DSP and DAC.

   The numerically controlled oscillator has an accumulator, often called a
phase accumulator, that counts out the phase of the analog signal to be
synthesized. If there is modulation, then it is incorporated at this stage. Both
modulation and the center frequency of the modulated output are changed
by changing the accumulator's step size. The accumulator drives a sine look-
up table that then produces the digital words presented to the DAC.

   A DDS has the advantage that the output frequency can be changed
almost instantaneously which is in contrast to a PLL in which the rate of
frequency change of the output is limited by the bandwidth of the loop filter.
A major disadvantage of a DDS is the number of spurious signals generated
by quantization issues, and this is mostly related to the bit length of the
accumulator. There are also aliasing or image signals generated as images
of the intended signal relative to the clock frequency. However, the spurious
signals from two DDS units with the same reference oscillator are correlated
and this can be exploited in some system architectures to remove the effect of
spurious signals. Most of the negative characteristics of a DDS are reduced by
using a longer accumulator and hence a DAC with a larger number of input
bits. This, however, leads to increased power consumption. These drawbacks
are sometimes insignificant when compared to the frequency agility and
system simplicity achieved.

     6.11 Diode and Vacuum Sources

     There are many types of sources based on special properties of diodes
     or of vacuum devices. This section describes some of these sources.
     While sources based on transistor circuits are preferred for integration and
     manufacturability, diode and vacuum sources are in widespread use because
     of either the high power that can be efficiently generated or because they
     operate at high frequencies beyond the reach of transistor circuits.

     6.11.1 Two-Terminal Semiconductor Sources

     Two-terminal semiconductor sources are based on exploiting the negative
     resistance presented at the terminals of several types of devices [37-40]. They
     either exploit a dynamic negative resistance created in a high field region of
     a semiconductor due to a charge imbalance, or they exploit the finite time
     for carriers to cross a semiconductor region and thus produce an RF current
     that is out of phase with the applied voltage, thus presenting a negative RF
     resistance. Three representative devices are the tunnel diode, the IMPATT
     diode, and the Gunn diode.

     Tunnel Diode

     A tunnel diode is a pn junction diode in which the conduction band states
     on the n side are filled with electrons and these line up with empty valance
     band states (i.e. holes) on the p side [37-46]. This results in a very narrow pn
     junction barrier. For negative voltages and small and large applied voltages
     the diode acts as a conventional pn junction diode with an exponential
     current-voltage characteristic. However, as the applied voltages increase
     above zero, the conduction and valance bands become more misaligned
     and the voltage eventually drops before increasing again. This effect is
     due to quantum mechanical tunnelling. This is seen in the current-voltage
     characteristic of the tunnel diode shown in Figure 6-29(a), where the drop in
MIXER AND SOURCE MODULES                                                           215

current creates a negative dynamic resistance. Embedded in an appropriate
circuit, even as simple as a parallel RLC circuit, the tunnel diode is the active
element of an RF oscillator. Usually a Gunn diode has a very high dopant
concentration so that the reverse breakdown voltage is very low.

IMPATT Diode

An IMPATT diode (IMPact ionization Avalanche Transit-Time) produces
high power and throughout the history of its use it has produced the highest
power levels at the highest frequency, up to 1000 GHz, of any semiconductor
device [37-40, 47-51].

   The IMPATT diode is the most important of the transit time semiconductor
diodes, see Figure 6-29(b). In transit time devices the generation of charge
carriers is concentrated in one narrow region of the diode. In an IMPATT
diode, a high field at the boundary between a highly doped n region, the
n+ region, and a lightly doped n region leads to avalanche multiplication
producing holes and electrons. The holes are quickly collected by an adjacent
metal contact and the electrons transit through a drift region with usually
intrinsic doping and a constant field. If the drifting electrons are sufficiently
delayed, then the RF current through the device will be out of phase with
the applied RF voltage (superimposed on a biasing DC voltage) and a
negative RF resistance is presented at the device terminals. The roles of the
holes and electrons can also be exchanged. Thus the IMPATT diode can be
used as the active component of an oscillator [52]. They can be used in an
amplifier as a reflection device having a reflection coefficient greater than
one [53]. However, the oscillating signal produced has high noise due to the
underlying avalanche process.

   Other effects can produce charges that eventually drift and produce a
negative RF resistance. An example is a TUNNETT diode that injects charges
through tunneling [54, 55]. Another device is the TRAPATT diode (trapped
plasma avalanche transit time diode), a pn junction diode, where the carrier
injection results from a trapped space-charge plasma formed within the
junction region [42, 56].

Gunn Diode

A Gunn diode is also called a transferred electron device or a Gunn effect
device. While strictly not a diode as there is not a junction, the name Gunn
diode has become common usage because there are two electrodes. The
structure and current-voltage characteristic of a Gunn diode are shown
in Figure 6-29(c) [37-40, 57-61]. The device has three n-type regions: two
heavily doped n+ regions at each contact, separated by a lightly doped n-
region. When a voltage is applied to the device, most of the voltage is across
the n- region and the device acts like a resistor with the current through
the Gunn diode proportional to the voltage across it. At higher voltages the
conductivity of the n- region drops and the current drops, so that there is a
region of negative dynamic resistance.

     6.11.2 Vacuum Devices

     Some microwave systems use vacuum tubes to obtain high RF powers; the
     most common vacuum tube devices are reviewed here.

     Magnetron

     The magnetron is the original device used for generating microwave power
     and was invented during World War II for use in radar equipment. It is
     most commonly used in microwave ovens, where it is the most efficient
     means of producing microwave power at 2.4 GHz. It is used in military
     systems today to produce megawatts of pulsed RF power and is used to
     generate substantial power up to a few terahertz [62-65]. In a magnetron a
     circular chamber, containing the cathode, is surrounded by and connected to
     a number of resonant cavities. The walls of the chamber are the anode. The
     cavity dimensions determine the frequency of the output signal. A strong
     constant magnetic field in the chamber causes electrons that want to flow
     from the cathode to the anode to rotate. As the electrons pass the entrance
     of the circular cavities, the electrons interact with the EM field in the cavity,
     enhancing the field at a characteristic frequency, which is the frequency of
     oscillation of the magnetron.

     Klystron

     The klystron is a long, narrow vacuum tube with an electron gun (the
     cathode) at one end and an anode at the other [66-69]. In between is a series
     of doughnut-shaped resonant cavities aligned so that the electron beam from
     the cathode passes through the hole. As the beam passes the cavities, small
     changes in the electron beam affect the EM field in the cavities. The EM fields
     in the cavities begin to oscillate, which in turn affect the passing electron
     beam. A feedback effect results, and when the last and first resonant cavities
     are connected, a large oscillating microwave signal is produced.

     Traveling Wave Tube and Backward Wave Oscillator

     A traveling wave tube (TWT) is a long vacuum tube with an electron gun
     (the cathode) at one end and a collector (the anode) at the other. The electron
     beam produced by the gun travels down the center of a long wire helix
     [70-75]. An excitation coupling probe, an antenna, placed near the cathode
     introduces a microwave signal. This modulates the electron beam, which in
     turn induces an RF current in the helix. The helix is designed so that the EM
     signal supported by the helix travels at the same speed as the electron beam
     so that the electron beam and EM signal guided by the helix continuously
     interact. Thus the RF current in the helix as well as the RF field grow in
     strength along the tube. An output probe at the anode end of the tube couples
     to the RF field and delivers an amplified version of the input RF signal. As
     an amplifier the TWT is called a traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA).

        In the TWT the helix slows the RF signal down to match the speed of
     the electrons and so the helix is called a slow-wave structure. Another tube
     device that uses a slow-wave structure is the backward wave oscillator
     (BWO). However, in the BWO the beam is directed against the traveling
     wave supported by the helix.

6.12 Summary

This chapter described a number of complex mixer and oscillator modules
that are available to assemble high-performance RF and microwave systems.
These modules and the other modules used in this book are often
available as off-the-shelf items from companies that specialize in designing
modules. This is a cost effective way of developing low and medium
volume microwave systems such as basestation hardware. For a competitive
advantage a company selling a system or subsystem may develop some of
the modules themselves. For a high volume market, say for a cell phone,
many of the modules would be integrated on-chip. Design is then an
expensive proposition but overall performance and size would be optimized.

7.1 Introduction

Design of a receiver or transmitter circuit requires the design of a cascade
of modules that achieves optimum dynamic range while managing DC
power consumption. As an example the frequency conversion stage of a
receiver is shown in Figure 7-1. The microstrip filters and transmission lines
are fabricated on alumina substrates. The semiconductor dies and the chip
decoupling capacitors as well as the alumina modules are epoxied to a
mat that was screen-printed on a brass housing. The mat provides a stress-
relieving (allowing for differences in thermal coefficients of expansion) and
conducting interface between the alumina and semiconductor substrates and
the brass housing. The modules and dies are interconnected by bond wires
arranged as two or more bond wires in parallel to reduce inductance. The
bond wires attach to the pads on the decoupling capacitors. These modules,
with the exception of filters, are described in this chapter.

   The chapter begins with investigation of a cascade of modules given
the distortion characteristics of the individual modules. Coupled with an
earlier treatment of noise of a cascaded system this defines dynamic range.
A microwave systems comprising a cascade of mostly two-port modules
and must be designed to simultaneously minimize noise, distortion, DC
power consumption, spurious emissions, and maximize dynamic range.
There is necessarily a trade-off of these performance parameters and this
trade-off is at the heart of system design. What makes this particularly
challenging is that the two-port networks are designed separately and there

     is incomplete characterization of performance. Indeed the only accurate way
     of determining overall system performance would be to have the circuit-
     level schematics of each module and then perform a whole system time-
     domain circuit-level siulation using the actual modulated signals. Even if
     all the details were available the simulation time would be prohibitive and
     a time-domain simulation is unlikely to have the necessary fidelity. This is
     true even if a large part of a system is implemented on the same chip. Thus
     system design must use a methodical process using incomplete module-level
     parameters such as the 1 dB gain compression, noise figure, and third-order
     intercept characterizations. System design is often conservative designing for
     worst case. Sometimes this is too conservative and allowances must be made.

Testing and adjustment of fabricated prototypes is essential.
   This section describes two approaches to cascaded module design; the

budget method and the contribution method. In the budget method gain and
noise performance metrics are initially assigned to each stage in a cascade
and then these are adjusted in a system simulator to iterate towards an
optimum solution. In the contribution method the focus is on dynamic range
and each critical module is assigned the same dynamic range and from this
an initial assignment of noise figure, gain, and required linearity is made for
each module. The optimization of system performance proceeds as with the
budget method. Generally this optimization must be performed manually
using experience as often it is difficult to quantify what an optimum is. Also
some design decisions require the acquisition of higher cost modules and if a
module is low cost then it makes sense to assign high dynamic range to such
a module to reduce the requirements on other higher cost modules. Perhaps a
module must be redesigned or designed in-house instead of being externally
sourced. These are not simple decisions. In the end, the system with cascaded
modules must be cost and performance competitive, and reducing time to
market is a competitive advantage.

7.2 Nonlinear Distortion in a Cascaded System

This section builds on the distortion analysis of two-port networks in Section
4.5 and addresses the determination of the nonlinear metrics of a cascaded
system such the receiver shown in Figure 7-2. The filters and interstage
matching networks eliminate harmonics from the system but, unfortunately,
allow in-band and close-in out-of-band distortion components to pass
through the system. The main metrics that describe nonlinear performance
are the power levels at the 1 dB gain compression point and at the third-order
intercept (IP3) point. In some systems, such as direct-conversion receivers,
the second-order intercept point (IP2) is also important. These metrics relate
to discrete tones and the correlated distortion generated in the different
stages. This contrasts with the calculation of noise of a cascaded system
where the noise added by stages is uncorrelated.

7.2.1 Gain Compression in a Cascaded System

When two amplifier stages are cascaded it is necessary to determine the 1 dB
gain compression point of the cascade. Consider the cascade in Figure 7-3.
The two stages have linear power gains G1 and G2, and 1 dB compression
points P1,1dB and P2,1dB, respectively. The total linear power gain of the
system is GT = G1 · G2. If the Taylor series expansion of the input-output
characteristics of the first stage in the cascade is

v1o(t)  =  ao  +    a1  v1i  (t)  +  a2    2  (t)  +  a3    3  (t)  +  .  .  .  ,  (7.1)

                                         v1i              v1i
226                                   STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

Figure 7-3: Cascade of two
stages used in determin-
ing the total 1 dB compres-
sion point of the system.

     then at the interface of the two stages the amplitude of the tone at f1 due to
     a single-tone input, vi(t) = Vi cos(1t), is v1o(t) = V1o cos(1t), where

                                                 V1o = a1Vi + 43 a3Vi3.                                                   (7.2)

     The harmonics are ignored, as design of the interstage matching network
     would preferably be lowpass to eliminate the passage of harmonics. The
     input of the second stage is v2i(t) = v1o(t), with the Taylor series expansion
     of the second stage being

                             v2o(t)   =  bo  +  b1  v2i  (t)    +  b2    2  (t)  +  b3    3  (t)  +  .  .  .  .           (7.3)

                                                                       v2i              v1i

     Thus the component of the final output at f1 will be

                                  Vo  =  a1b1Vi     +    4 b1a3Vi3 3   +    34 a1b3Vi   3  +...      .                    (7.4)

     That is, the input signal is multiplied by the overall linear gain of the

     amplifier; this is the first term on the right in Equation (7.4), and the last

     two terms result in gain compression. If the stages are identical (i.e., a1 = b1

     and a3 = b3) the two gain compression terms will be identical. Thus the two

     stages will contribute equally to gain compression.

         Note that in Equation (7.4) voltages add to yield the overall gain

     compression. In general the two stages will not be identical, they will

     have different gain and 1 dB compression points, however, this observation

     (i.e., that the voltages add) does enable an approximate expression to be

     developed for the 1 dB compression point of a cascaded system.

         Examination of Equation (7.4) leads to a general formula for the total 1 dB

     compression             point,   PT ,   of  the   two-stage            cascade     in   Figure        7-3:

         Equation (7.5) is a very conservative estimate of the 1 dB gain compression

     point of the amplifier and flags the lowest power levels at which gain

     compression of the cascade could occur. The situation could be better

     depending on the phasing of the distortion components but conservatism

     is very important in system design. The worst case is what matters in

     specifying system performance. Getting the effect of phasing right in system

     design requires a circuit-level simulation but when working with modules

such information is rarely available. Equation (7.5) cannot be directly derived
from the voltage expansion as the power gain of microwave amplifiers
is due to difference of input and output impedance levels in addition to
voltage gain. It should be noted that a microwave amplifier deviates from
linearity following a sharper, tanh-like, response than that described by a
low-order polynomial model of linearity. Thus simply cascading low-order
polynomials describing each stage is not a viable option.

   If required and if a more realistic estimate is required and can be justified,
then a less conservative formula that can be used to estimate the gain
compression level of two cascaded stages is

                     T -1                           -1                -1

It is usually better to use the more conservative estimate of compression in
Equation (7.5).

EXAMPLE 7.1 Gain Compression of a Two-Stage Amplifier

The first stage of a two-stage amplifier in a transmitter has a gain G1 = 20 dB and an output
1 dB gain compression power P1,1dB = 10 dBm. The second stage has a gain G2 = 6 dB and
an output 1 dB gain compression power P2,1dB = 20 dBm.

(a) What is the linear gain of the two-stage amplifier?
(b) What is the gain of the two-stage amplifier at the 1 dB gain compression power?
(c) What is the 1 dB gain compression power of the cascaded system?

Solution:

(a) When the gain of an amplifier stage is given without qualification it should be assumed
     to be the linear gain, that is, the gain at small signal levels. So the total linear power gain
     of the two-stage amplifier is

                                   GT = G1G2 = 20 dB + 6 dB = 26 dB.

(b) The compressed gain will be 1 dB less, that is, GT = 25 dB.

(c)  The  overall gain       compression power,               T  is, approximately obtained                    using  Equation

     A quick check is as follows.

     If Stage 1 dominates gain compression, the output power at the 1 dB compression is

     P1,1 dB = 10 dBm multiplied by the linear power gain of the second stage, that is,

        T    =  G2 P1,1  dB  =  6  dB    +   10  dBm    =  16  dBm.

     If Stage 2 dominates compression, the output power at the 1 dB compression of the two-

     stage   amplifier   is  just  that  of  Stage  2:     T   =  20  dBm.

EXAMPLE 7.2 Second Example of Gain Compression of a Two-Stage Amplifier

     The first stage of a two-stage amplifier in a transmitter has a gain G1 = 13 dB and an output
     1 dB gain compression power P1,1dB = 10 dBm. The second stage gain is G2 = 10 dB and the
     output 1 dB gain compression power is P2,1dB = 20 dBm. What is the 1 dB gain compression
     power of the two-stage amplifier system?

     Solution:

     The  total    gain  compression   power,      T   is  approximately  obtained     using     Equation  (7.5):

                                                P1dB,

                             (100)- 2 + (100)- 2           mW = 25.00 mW = 13.98 dBm.
                   P1dB =                                                                                  (7.8)

     A quick check is as follows.

     If Stage 1 dominates compression, the output power at 1 dB compression of the two-

     stage amplifier is P1,1dB multiplied by the linear power gain of the second stage, taht is

        T  =    G2P1,1   dB  =  10  dBm  +  10  dB  =  20  dBm.

     P1dB                                          T

     If  Stage  2  dominates    compression,    P1dB   =   P2,1dB  =  20  dBm.  Thus   neither   stage  dominates

     compression.

                            A final note is that the calculation of the 1 dB compression point when
                         both stages in a two-stage system contribute equally to gain compression is
                         approximate as the actual compression characteristic is complex and a third-
                         order Taylor series does not capture the total nonlinear response [1, 2].

                            The response of a multistage system can be extrapolated from the treat-
                         ment here for two stages. For an m-stage cascade,

                         7.2.2 Intermodulation Distortion in a Cascaded System

                         The two-stage system shown in Figure 7-4 will be used here to determine
                         the total intermodulation response as described by the third-order input
                         and output intercept points, IIP3 and OIP3, respectively. The development
                         is based on the analysis of intermodulation distortion in Section 4.5.3 and
                         is called the cascade intercept method. One version of the method is called
                         the organized cascade intercept method, in which the worst-case situation

is assumed, in that the IM3 produces from each stage in the cascade add
in phase. The other method is the unorganized cascade intercept method in
which the phases of IM3 produce by each stage are unknown, and assumes
that the most likely overall IM3 distortion will be obtained by assuming a
random phase relationship of the IM3 contributions.

   The third-order intercept point, IP3, is determined by extrapolating the
small signal gain and IM3 responses. Since IM3 is small, the signal· flow
in the two-stage system is as shown in Figure 7-5. One path in the flow
linearly amplifies the input two-tone signal in Stages 1 and 2. The third-
order nonlinearity of Stage 1 creates low-level IM3 that is linearly amplified
by the second stage. A second set of IM3 signals is produced by the IM3 of
the second stage operating on the two-tone signal amplified by Stage 1. The
voltages of the two IM3 signals add constructively. A complication is that the
phases of the two IM3 signals, at x and y, are not known. This leads to two
approaches to estimating of the overall distortion.

Organized Cascade Intercept Method

The worst-case situation is that the IM3 voltages at x and y are in phase so
that the voltages add. Then the total IM3 distortion is obtained by adding
the IM3 voltages generated from each stage. Determining total OIP3, OIP3T
is the inverse problem. This cannot be solved precisely, but a good estimate
for OIP3T is obtained from [3, 4]

OIP3T - 21  (G2OIP31)- 12 + (OIP32)- 12 .                     (7.10)

Note that OIP3 is a power and G is a power gain. Now the total gain of the
cascade GT = G1G2, and since OIP3T = GTIIP3T, where OIP3T, the input
intercept of the cascade, can be written

IIP3T - 21  (IIP31)- 12 + (IIP32/G1)- 12 .                    (7.11)

Generalizing these results, for an m-stage cascade the overall OIP3 is

OIP3T - 21  (Gm . . . G2OIP31)- 12 + . . . G - mOIP3(m-1) 21  (7.12)
                  + (OIP3m)- 21 .
230     STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     Since IIP3 = OIP3/G, the general result for multiple cascaded stages can be
     written

     1  1  1                                                            1

        The organized cascade intercept method often provides an overly
     conservative (i.e., far too low) estimate of OIP3T and IIP3T distortion.

     Unorganized Cascade Intercept Method

     If the phases of the stages are random (or perhaps unknown), then
     it is reasonable to add the powers of the distortion terms. This is an
     approximation as the IM3 signals are still correlated, but this approach has
     been found to provide a useful measure in design, then

        OIP3T -1  (G2OIP31)-1 + (OIP32)-1 ,                             (7.14)

     and again OIP3 is a power and G is a power gain. For an m-stage cascade
     with random IM3 phase the total OIP3, OIP3T, is obtained from

     OIP3T -1  (Gm . . . G2OIP31)-1 + . . . + G2OIP3(m-1) -1 + (OIP3m)-1
                                                                                                (7.15)

     and the total IIP3, IIP3T, is obtained from (since IIP3 = OIP3/G)

     IIP3T 1  1 IIP3 + G1 + · · · + G(m-1) . . . G1 . 1 IIP32 IIP3m (7.16)

     Summary

     The cascade intercept method has led to two sets of results for IM3
     distortion. The first, from the organized cascade intercept method, is the
     worst-case situation in which the IM3 distortion of each stage combines
     in the worst possible way. This yielded the overall IIP3 and OIP3 results
     of Equations (7.12) and (7.13). The second, from the unorganized cascade
     intercept method, assumes that the phases of the IM3 from each stage are
     randomly related, perhaps the best estimate that can be made without a
     circuit simulation. This yielded the overall IIP3 and OIP3 results of Equations
     (7.15) and (7.16).

        It is interesting to speculate what would happen if the stages were
     designed so that the IM3 contributions at x and y (referring to Figure 7-
     5) of the first and second stages were 180 out of phase but with the same
     magnitude. If this could be done the IM3 contributions at the output would
     be canceled. Indeed, it is possible to do this to a limited extent. The phase of
     the IM3 signals depends on the signal level and so changes over the signal
     range. Careful design, and only when there is complete control over the
     design and integration of the stages, enables the IMD contributions to be
     partially canceled over a range of signal levels, as shown in Figure 7-6. This
     extends the dynamic range of the cascaded system, and the simple OIP3 and
     IIP3 metrics are not sufficient to capture this complexity.

EXAMPLE 7.3 Intermodulation Distortion of a Two-Stage Amplifier

The first stage of a two-stage amplifier in a transmitter has a gain of G1 = 20 dB and
an output third-order intercept point, OIP31, of 30 dBm. The second stage has a gain of
G2 = 20 dB and an OIP3 of 40 dBm. Assume that the IMD contributions of each stage are in
phase. What is the OIP3 of the cascaded system?

Solution:

Using the organized cascade intercept method, the total OIP3, OIP3T, in milliwatts is
obtained using Equation (7.10)

OIP3T - 12                                         - 12  10(40/10)  - 12    105 - 12 +  104 - 12 .  (7.17)
                                                                                                    (7.18)
              10(20/10) 10(30/10) +                                      =

Thus OIP3T = 5772 mW = 37.6 dBm.

This is the worst-case situation. It is worth comparing this to a calculation where the phases
of the IMD contributions are unknown. Then, using Equation (7.14),

    OIP3T -1  10(20/10) 10(30/10) -1 +                   10(40/10)  -1 = 105 + 104.                 (7.19)
Thus OIP3T = 9091 mW = 39.6 dBm.                                                                    (7.20)

7.3 Cascaded Module Design Using the Budget Method

The budget method is used to design RF cascade systems, particularly the
design of receiver and transmitter cascaded systems, for specified gain,
noise, and distortion. In the budget method, initial assignments of gain and
noise performance are made to each stage in a cascade. This approach is
based on the calculation of the total noise figure and gain of a system from
the parameters of individual subsystem stages (see Section 4.3.1). This is
coupled with the calculation of nonlinear distortion in cascaded stages (in
Section 7.2), to calculate the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) and make
assignments for noise and distortion contributions of each stage [5]. The
SFDR is related to the gain compression, noise, and nonlinear distortion
metrics in Figure 7-7. The system optimization goal is, in general, to choose
and adjust modules to maximize overall SFDR subject to the constraints of
cost and availability of modules with the required attributes. For example,
the gain of most amplifier modules can be adjusted and so change the

                         the noise and nonlinear distortion metrics of each stage are set based on
                         experience.

                            Considering the stages in the cascade shown in Figure 7-8, generally
                         maximum gain is assigned to the first active stage, and so the first stage
                         contributes the most to the system noise figure. However, as a consequence
                         active devices in latter stages nearly always require significantly higher
                         linearity performance than may be necessary to meet the system SFDR
                         objective. Still the budget method is a systematic way to design a cascaded
                         system. Experience can also be used in the budget assignments. For example,
                         in transmitter cascade design the intent might be to provide as high an
                         intercept as possible in the lower-frequency up-conversion stages. This
                         approach is based on devices operating at lower frequencies having very
                         good linearity and therefore being most cost effective in achieving high IP3.

                     7.4 Cascaded Module Design Using the Contribution
                            Method

                         The contribution method is an approach to the design of cascade RF systems
                         for maximum SFDR [6] rather than separate treatment of noise and nonlinear
CASCADE OF MODULES                                                                233

distortion. The contribution method provides a good initial assignment of
the noise figure, gain, and required linearity to individual stages and enables
informed assessment of trade-offs during system design.

   In the budget method, noise performance is largely determined by the
first stage and the nonlinear performance by latter stages. This often results
in suboptimum system design. One of the costs is often the use of more
expensive stages than necessary or higher linearity requirements of some
stages leading to increased supply power.

   The contribution method assigns to each active stage a percentage
contribution to the overall SFDR. Contributions of the stages are balanced as
no single stage dominates noise or distortion, and all contributions to SFDR
are equally weighted. In realizing a cascaded system, typically one or more
offending stages either dominate the SNR or significantly degrade overall
distortion. In some cases a redistribution of stage parameters (such as gain)
reduces the degradation. In other cases a change in architecture is required.

   The mathematics behind the contribution approach is based on an
extension of the noise and distortion analyses of cascaded stages. The
noise performance of a stage is characterized by its noise factor F =
No/(GNi), where G is the available power gain of the stage, No is the
output noise power, and Ni is the input noise power of a resistor held at
standard temperature (290 K). Distortion is characterized by the amount
of intermodulation distortion (IMD) produced in a two-tone test and
specifically the third-order intercept point (IP3) (see Figure 7-7). In the
following development a passive linear stage such as a filter or attenuator
is combined with the following active stage.

7.4.1 Noise Contribution

Friis's formula yields the noise factor of a cascaded system and was derived
in Section 4.3.1. This section presents an alternative development of Friis's
formula with interim steps that can be used in calculating the dynamic range
contributions of each stage. The analysis here was originally presented in [6].

   First consider the contribution of individual stages to system noise, and
assume that all stages are matched. The nth stage, with all ports having equal
bandwidth B, has output noise power (from Equation (4.24)

                    Nno = FnGnkT0B,                   (7.21)

where k is the Boltzmann constant, and Fn and Gn are the noise factor and
available power gain of the nth stage, respectively. The excess noise power of
successive stages is additional to that of the first. So, while the output noise
power contribution of the first stage is

                    N1o = F1G1kT0B,                   (7.22)

the excess output noise power of the second stage is

      N2o = (F2 - 1)kT0BG2.                           (7.23)

Note that the output noise of the first stage includes the noise contribution
of the source resistance held at the standard temperature. However, this is
not included in the noise contributed by the second or latter stages. The total
noise power at the output of a two-stage cascade is

   T  =             (F2   -  1)kT0BG2  +  N1oG2.      (7.24)

N2o
234                         STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

     Then the total noise power at the output of the mth stage is

                                  m                               n                        m   (7.25)
                      T
                                      (Fn - 1)kT0B Gi                 + F1kT0B Gn.
                   Nmo =
                                                                 i=2                      n=1
                                 n=2

     Thus an m-stage cascade has total cascaded system noise factor F T =
     NmTo/ GTN1i , with GT being the total cascaded available gain and N1i the
     noise power input to the first stage. In terms of the parameters of individual

     stages

                                      T m Fn - 1
                                      F = F1 +                        .                        (7.26)
                                                       m

                                                n=2 Gi-1

                                                     i=n

        The link between Equations (7.25) and (7.26) enables the noise contribution
     of each stage to be determined. Treated separately, Equation (7.25) provides
     the output noise power of a cascade such as a receiver. Although the
     extension of Equation (7.25) to Equation (7.26) is normally associated with
     the derivation of the receiver noise factor, it can also be used in transmitter
     noise analysis.

        Now the noise contribution of a stage can be defined. The gain
     accumulated at the jth stage (the total cascade gain up to and including the
     jth stage) is

                                                  j

                                         A     =       Gn                                      (7.27)

                                      Gj

                                                  n=1

     (and  so  GT  =  GA    for  an   m-stage  cascade).  The         fractional  noise  contribution

                         m

     of the jth stage to the total output noise is then defined as

                   CjN = stage noise contribution                       A T Fj - 1 .           (7.28)
                                                                      Gj /Gj F

     This is one component of the SFDR contribution of a stage.

     7.4.2 Intermodulation Contribution

     The intermodulation distortion of a cascade is assessed using the cascade
     intercept method (see Section 7.2.2). The usual design approach of
     establishing the SNR in the early stages of the cascade (this is the budget
     method) results in stages further along the cascade needing to have higher
     intercept values. Consequently these stages will generally have additional
     power consumption, as this is usually required to increase IIIP3 (or OIP3).
     Trade-offs of the contributions of individual stages to distortion and noise
     will lead to constrained total power consumption while still achieving the
     required system SFDR.

        For receiver systems the contribution to nonlinear distortion is captured by
     IIP3 and for all stages this will be referred to the input of the cascaded system.
     Keeping with the nomenclature of the previous section, the accumulated IP3
     of the jth stage referred to the system input is

                                      IIP3Aj = IIP3j /GAj-1                                    (7.29)
CASCADE OF MODULES                                                                       235

and  is          A  when  expressed  in  dBm.  Note  that  all  prior   gain  and  loss

         IIP3dBm,j

up to the jth stage modifies the intercept when it is referred to the input of

the cascaded stages. Combining the contribution of individual stages using

Equation (7.16) yields the total system IIP3:

                          T m 1 -1
                          IIP3 =                     .                        (7.30)
                                               A
                                     n=1 IIP3n

This leads to the definition of the fractional contribution of the jth stage to
the system IIP3:

                      IIP3 IIP3T                                              (7.31)
                    Cj = IIP3 contribution  A .

                                                         IIP3j

This is the second and final component of the SFDR contribution of a stage.

7.4.3 Design Methodology for Maximizing Dynamic Range

In this section a design methodology is developed for trading off the
performance of each stage in maximizing the SFDR of the RF down-
converter module shown in Figure 7-8. A central component of the
methodology is the use of a stage contribution graph that indicates
performance of each stage. This graph enables visualization of the
contribution of each stage to system dynamic range, identifying which stage
or stages dominate performance. For example, the initial contributions for
the example used in the case study that follows are shown in Table 7-1.
The noise and distortion contributions indicate the stage that tends to have
the most impact on noise factor or distortion. Redistribution of gain, noise,
or distortion alters this relationship and leads to changes in system SFDR.
Passive stages generally do not introduce distortion, but they do contribute
noise. So, to simplify the following discussion, passive stages immediately
preceding an active stage and the active stage itself will be considered as a
single stage.

   First of all, consider the traditional budget method approach in which the
noise figure of a receiver cascade is established by maximizing the gain of
the first stage, and thus the first stage establishes the SNR of the system since
the noise contributions of subsequent stages are assumed to be negligible.
With the system SNR fixed, a target system SFDR determines the overall
IP3 performance described by the total system IIP3, IIP3T. Also, in the
budget method, the first stage has negligible impact on overall IIP3. Then a
reasonable choice in the design process is to select stages following the first as
contributing equally to the reduction in IIP3T. Thus, in the budget method,
the minimum acceptable IIP3 (in dBm) of the jth stage (i.e., IIP3dBm,j) in
an m-stage cascade that is required to meet the target total IIP3 in dBm

     (Note that the overline in IIP3dBm identifies the target IIP3dBm and not the

     actual IIP3.) In addition, the gain or loss of preceding stages will modify this

     IIP3 as indicated in Equation (7.29). That is, with this assignment each stage

     makes an equal contribution to the overall intermodulation distortion. That

     is, each stage has the same IP3 referred to the system input. For example, in

     a cascade of three stages, each stage would need to have a minimum system

     IIP3 of 4.8 dB (= 10 log 3) in excess of the target system IIP3 (i.e., IIP3dBm T ).

     If instead, using the contribution method, the cascade system was

     designed so that each stage contributed equally to the overall noise (CjN

     being the same for all stages), and each stage had the same gain (Gj being

     the same for all stages), then the required individual IIP3 values tend to

     be minimum. Maximizing system dynamic range becomes an exercise in

     maintaining the lowest noise power and highest IIP3 value throughout the

     cascade. The link between these parameters values is the distribution of gain

     and loss [7, 8].

     For a transmitter, the SFDR is most commonly referred to the output and

     (repeating Equation (4.88))

                          SFDRdB,o   =  2  (OIP3dBm  - NdBm,o) ,     (7.34)
                                        3

     and SFDRi = SFDRo. In the above, Ni and No are the total input and output
     noise powers and are assigned a noise floor value dependent on the cascade
     noise factor target and linear system gain.

     7.4.4 Summary

     The contribution method for designing systems of cascaded modules focuses
     on assigning the same dynamic range to each module. Of course linear
     modules such as a filter easily meet any system dynamic range requirement
     so the dynamic range assignments should focus on the nonlinear modules.
     Very often the dynamic range of an active module can be increased by either
     increasing the biasing of the module or switching to an alternative module
     but with high power requirements. Sometimes modules with different
     technology could provide increased dynamic range without increasing
     power consumption but such modules could be more expensive. The
     contribution method and the previously considered budget method only
     provide an initial starting point for system design. The system must still
     be optimized and often manually optimized as there are too many hard to
     quantify design goals. For example minimizing time-to-market and design
     cost are goals that cannot be parameterized.

     7.5 Case Study: High Dynamic Range Down-Converter
            Design

     In this section a down-converter in a receiver is designed. With the
     architecture and modules chosen in the RF cascade, the only quantities

that can be selected by the user are the gains of the amplifier stages. If
adjusting the gains is not sufficient to meet system objectives, then it would
be necessary to choose other modules or change the architecture.

7.5.1 Architecture

A down-converter with the architecture of Figure 7-8 is designed here
considering the first four stages only and using the balanced contribution
method for the initial stage assignment. The system operates at 1.5 GHz with
a first IF of 250 MHz and an IIP3 design target of 0 dBm (i.e., IIP3dBm T =
0 dBm) with a noise figure target of 10 dB (i.e., NFT = 10 dB). The initial
stage assignments for balanced noise and IMD contributions are shown in
Table 7-1.

   The stage assignments shown in Table 7-1 meet the target specifications
exactly, with no single stage contributing any more than the required
noise factor or nonlinearity (distortion) to meet the target. The LNA gain
is low, permitting a significant reduction in required mixer IP3. In an
RF system usually the mixer has the limiting distortion performance so
anything that can be done to reduce the linearity required for a mixer
is advantageous. The noise figure of a mixer can also be high. With this
in mind, the process of system cascade trade-off and selection of actual
element parameters continues in the following sections. That is, assignment
of balanced contributions to each stage is a good initial starting point. This is
followed up with further optimization and trade-offs.

7.5.2 Design

Design proceeds with a selection of available modules for stages and
continuous but limited variation of stage parameters (through bias control,
for example). The following stages were chosen for the stages (see Figure 7-
8): an MMIC amplifier for Stage 2 (NEC part UPC2745) and a MMIC mixer
for Stage 4 (MCL part SYM-2500). Bandpass dielectric resonator filters were
chosen for Stages 1 and 3. In particular, a tuned lumped-element Chebychev
bandpass filter with 0.1 dB ripple at 1.5 GHz was used to provide settable
loss in Stage 3 and this proved to be important in establishing balanced
stage contributions and improved dynamic range. The continuous control
parameters include controlling the mixer IMD contribution by changing the
LNA gain (through bias control), changing the mixer IIP3 (by varying the
LO drive level), and retuning the Stage 3 filter. The noise and distortion
contributions of stages with the initial stage assignment (from Table 7-
1), initial measured performance, and optimized design are shown in
Figures 7-9 and 7-10. Figure 7-11 depicts the dynamic range. Based on the
balanced contribution method, the SFDR is 109.5 dB normalized to a 1 Hz
bandwidth. The initial value provided by the devices selected is 108 dB.
After appropriate trade-off and adjustable loss in Stage 3, the dynamic range
achieved is 111 dB. Now the same system design could be achieved using
the budget assignment initially, but with much greater design effort.

                     7.6 Case Study: Analysis of a 15 GHz Receiver

                         Most RF and microwave systems convert information at one frequency
                         to information at another frequency that can either be more conveniently
                         processed in the case of a receiver or more conveniently radiated in the case
                         of a transmitter. Figure 7-12 is a 15 GHz receiver module which itself consists
                         of interconnected sub modules. Detail of the frequency conversion section is
                         given in Figure 7-13.

                            These sub modules could be called modules as well so that modules are
                         constructed by interconnecting other modules many of which are available
                         "off-the-shelf" from high-level modules such as a receiver. The receiver
                         module is part of a wireless service used in point-to-point microwave

7.7 Case Study: Frequency Planning of a Transceiver

This case study develops the architecture and frequency plan of a transceiver
for the licensed fixed wireless service in the 15 GHz band that provides
channels supporting up to 140 Mbit/s. This is the service that provides
two-way point-to-point communications most commonly to connect pairs
of cellular basestations to each other. A central basestation in a cluster of
basestations then connects traffic into a backbone fiber optic-based network.
Frequency planning begins with the specifications provided by national
regulatory authorities which generally adopt recommendations from the
International Telecommunications Union. (See [9] for the recommendations
concerning the 15 GHz fixed wireless service.)

   The 15 GHz fixed wireless band extends from 14.4 GHz to 15.35 GHz
supporting a number of channels with various channel spacing. The spacing
used will be based on local regulations and licensing. A universal transceiver
must support channel spacings of 2.5, 3.5, 7, 14, 28, and 56 MHz [9]. Figure
7-15(a) shows the channel assignment where fCH is the channel spacing. No

                                                       .

     guard bands between the channels are specified but typically a few 10's of
     kilohertz are sufficient. Thus channel spacing is only slightly larger than
     the modulation bandwidth and so there is a narrow guard band. Such a
     relatively tight guard band is possible as significant digital processing power
     can be used to resolve adjacent channels. At the low and high ends of the
     15 GHz band there is a guard band that is about half of a channel spacing so
     that other wireless services are not affected.

        A transceiver in the fixed wireless service supports one or more transmit
     and receive channel pairs. As specification in the ITU regulations the
     separation of transmit and receive channel pairings can be 315, 322, 420, 490,
     640, 644, 728, 840 MHz. That is, if a receive (or transmit) channel is centered
     at 14.500 GHz, then the paired transmit(or receive) channel is centered at
     14.815, 14.822, 14.920, 14.950, 15.140, 15.144, 15.228, or 15.340 MHz. Since a
     two-way link is established, the center frequency of the received channel at
     one end of the link is the center frequency of the transmitted channel at the
     other end of the link.

     7.7.1 Transceiver Architecture

     A transceiver must simultaneously transmit and receive channels and
     usually through the same antenna. Even if separate transmit and receive
     antennas are used, there will be significant coupling of the transmitted and
     received signal if they are located near each other. In practice transceivers use
     a diplex filter, a diplexer, to separate the 15 GHz band into two sub bands of
     equal bandwidth. In principal a diplex filter can be two filters combined to
     provide a lowpass function for the upper sub band and a highpass filter for
     the lower sub band. For fixed wireless service operation the diplex filter is
     designed as two adjacent bandpass filters, one passing the lower sub band
     and the other passing the upper sub band. Although the filter skirts can be
     designed to be very steep, they necessarily have finite frequency extent so

that the middle of the channel is no longer available to this transceiver.
   The high-level architecture of a transceiver for the 15 GHz fixed wireless

service is shown in Figure 7-16. This architecture provides high isolation of
the transmit and receive paths and supports a modular design approach. The
transmit section comprises the three modules shown on the top of the figure.
The first module is the transmit (Tx) digital baseband module that prepares
the digitally modulated signal for one (or more) transmit channels. Either
Reed-Solomon or trellis coded modulation (TCM) forward error correction
schemes are used. Five modulation formats are typically supported: QPSK,
QAM16, QAM32, QAM64 or QAM128 with the modulation scheme adjusted
to maintain a maximum bit error rate of 10-6. The signal in digital form
is based in the transmit digital baseband module. The transmit analog
baseband module modulates the signal on a carrier at an intermediate
frequency of around 1 GHz. This is then passed to the transmit RF
module which generates the RF signal in the 15 GHz band. Typically
the transmitted power is 26 dBm using QPSK modulation, 23 dBm using
QAM16, 22 dBm using QAM32, 20 dBM using QAM64, and 19 dBm
using QAM128 modulation. The signal then passes into one port of the
diplexer, here a waveguide diplexer, before passing to the antenna. The
receiver sensitivity is typically -93 dBm for QPSK, -86.5 dBm for QAM16,
-75 dBm for QAM32, -73.5 dBm for QAM64 modulation, and -68.5 dBm
for QAM128 modulation, again for a BER of better than 10-6.

   The waveguide diplexer is shown again in Figure 7-17. High performance
diplexers can be designed in waveguide as there is very little loss and the Qs
of the filter resonators are high [10, 11]. Here the waveguide diplexer has a
bandpass response that passes the lower sub band, and a second bandpass
response that passes the upper sub band. The sub band responses are shown
in Figure 7-15(b). The two bandpass responses are designed together so
that the diplexer performance is better than if two independently designed
bandpass filters were used. Either sub band output of the diplexer could be

                         connected to the transmitter (and the other to the receiver) depending on
                         whether the channel transmitted is in the lower or upper sub band.

                            The bottom three modules shown in Figure 7-16 comprise the receiver.
                         The RF signal enters the Receiver (Rx) RF module at RFIN where it is
                         down converted to an intermediate frequency signal around 1 GHz. The
                         intermediate signal passes to the Receive Analog Baseband module where
                         the desired channel (or perhaps more than one) is extracted and presented to
                         the receive digital baseband module at a frequency less than 100 MHz.

                            A common LO source is generated in the Reference LO module with one
                         output connected by cables to the Receive RF module and another version
                         of the LO, shifted by the appropriate receive/transmit frequency spacing,
                         routed to the Transmit RF module.

                            The transmit and receiver RF and analog baseband modules must
                         be mounted on the communication tower but the digital baseband and
                         reference LO modules can be located in an air conditioned room. Then
                         coaxial cables with signals up to 2 GHz route the RF signals and the reference
                         LO signals between the ground unit and the tower-mounted unit.

                     7.7.2 Frequency Planning

                         Basic frequency planning began with definition of the basic transceiver
                         architecture with the choice of an intermediate frequency after first
                         conversion (or before the final conversion in the case of the transmitter) that
                         is around 1 GHz. This choice was made as the transceiver must be able to
                         transmit across the entire 950 MHz bandwidth of the 15 GHz band. Once the
                         orientation of the diplexer has been fixed before delivery to the customer,
                         or in field installation, the transmit band is from one sub band to the other
                         sub band, a narrower but still significant 475 MHz bandwidth. However
                         the unit must still be designed to support operation over the whole band.
                         Thus, for the receiver, the design decision has been made to down convert an
                         entire sub band to a frequency range centered around 1 GHz. Such a circuit
                         must have essentially a lowpass response but with signals at DC and up
                         to a hundred megahertz or so above blocked by inductors and capacitors
                         providing DC connections and/or RF isolation. The fractional bandwidth
                         is too much for the design of a bandpass filter. The frequency conversion
                         description is similar for the transmitter.

                            Frequency planning has a major impact on the design cost of the
                         transceiver and in the unit cost, especially if extensive tuning is required
                         during manufacture. Frequency planning requires considerable experience
                         with knowledge of design cost drivers, manufacturability, which modules
                         and sub modules are available from vendors, and what one's own
                         organization can do to provide a competitive advantage. To be competitive

the transceiver must be tunable across the entire 15 GHz band.
   Cost is substantially reduced by sharing an LO between the transmitter

and receiver, with either the transmit or receiver versions of the LO shifted
by the appropriate transmit/receive spacing. The LO will be locked to a
low frequency reference using a phase-locked loop and then it must be
routed by coaxial cable to the receive and transmit RF modules. This means
that LO should ideally be below 2 GHz. This LO will now be called the
reference LO as it is not the ultimate frequency that is required by the mixer
in the frequency conversion section of the receiver RF module. Ultimately
the effective LO at the mixer must be tunable across the entire 15 GHz band
and so needs to tune at least by 950 MHz. Tuning can be accomplished using
phase-locked loops but realistically the tuning range that can be conveniently
achieved is 200 MHz or 15%, whichever is less up to 2 GHz.

   The basic signal flow in the receiver RF module is shown in Figure 7-
18(a). The basic concept is that the received RF signal is mixed with an LO to
produce a low frequency version as the intermediate frequency signal, the IF.
In the signal flow, a typically low-level RF signal is presented to the receiver
at the port indicated by RFIN. The RF signal is amplified by a low noise
amplifier so that circuit noise in the following RF signal path has no impact.
Since the level of the received signal is not known, the amplitude of the signal
must be leveled. The reference LO is at a frequency below that required to
pump the mixer so that it can be more easily generated and routed in the
transceiver. Generally it would be preferable to keep the signals to be routed
below 2 GHz as then the quality of the cabling and connections is less critical.
As a result the frequency of the reference LO signal must be increased before
it is presented to the mixer.

   Knowledge of which sub modules are readily available is also critical in
frequency planning. The use of frequency multipliers, essentially nonlinear
harmonic generators followed by filters, can increase the frequency by a
factor of 8 or so quite reliably. With frequency multiplication there is an
increase in the noise levels of the oscillator that impacts performance and

     this means that the noise performance of the reference LO needs to be that
     much better. Furthermore there is a need to adjust signal levels to avoid
     distortion. One of the essential characteristics of most module design is that
     modules can be freely interconnected without concern that one module will
     affect the operation of another module. To achieve this isolation is required.
     Another design choice is to use a subharmonic mixer in which the the pump
     frequency is about half of the RF frequency. The subharmonic mixer also has
     the property that very little of the second harmonic of the LO signal passes
     into the RF circuitry. It is very important that the range of frequencies in the
     LO path, the RF path, and the IF path do not overlap. With this knowledge
     the signal flow path in the receiver RF module can be extended as shown in
     Figure 7-18(b).

        Using the above considerations and also considering the transmit
     requirements leads to the detailed frequency plan shown in Figure 7-19.
     This plan is arrived at iteratively considering design and unit cost, as well
     as the required time to market. While Figure 7-19 shows the receiver using
     the lower sub band and the transmitter using the upper side bands, this sub
     band allocation could be reversed and this is achieved by simply switching

the diplexer sub band ports, i.e. by rotating the waveguide diplexer.

7.7.3 Summary

Once the frequency plan has been established the design of the individual
modules can proceed independently. The final receiver RF module was
shown in Figures 7-12 and 7-13 with the block diagram of the module shown
in Figure 7-14.

   Frequency planning may seem rather simple but it is more than drawing
a spectral diagram such as that in Figure 7-19. The architecture of the
transceiver is defined along with the frequency plan. Thus frequency
planning is done by experienced engineers with a broad appreciation
for RF system performance, knowledge of available off-the-shelf modules,
appreciation for cost, and appreciation for what it takes to develop a
competitive product. Frequency planning has a tremendous impact on
system cost. The final system design has a value far exceeding the cost of
the component sub modules.

7.8 Summary

A microwave system or subsystem is generally constructed as a cascade
of two-port modules. Typically such modules are interconnected on a
circuit board using microstrip structures with the system designer providing
matching networks, transmission line networks, system architecture, and
frequency plan. One or two decades ago crafting such a system using
vendor-supplied modules would have required a significant performance
compromise. As a result microwave companies necessarily developed large
portions of a design in-house that resulted in long design cycles. With
programmability and user-defined adjustments, perhaps by setting bias
levels, the gain, bandwidth, and distortion performance of off-the-shelf
modules can be adjusted. Active modules necessarily introduce distortion
and noise, and so managing dynamic range while managing DC power
consumption is a considerable concern.

   Design and analysis of RF and microwave systems is complicated by the
complex signals, i.e., modulated signals and not discrete sinewaves, used
in RF and microwave systems and by the excessively long simulation times
required to analyze microwave circuits with these signals. Design of linear
RF and microwave subsystems such as an amplifier or matching network
can proceed very well by simulating the structure one frequency at a time
and then stepping the signal frequency over the range of interest.

   The analysis of nonlinear microwave subsystems such as amplifiers is
more complicated but often it is sufficient to consider two-tones, signals
with two sinusoidal components and then there are efficient simulation
techniques such as harmonic balance analysis that enables subsystem
performance to be efficiently but approximately evaluated. However, neither
of these strategies is sufficient when trying to determine the performance of
RF and microwave systems. In this case complex signals such as digitally
modulated signals must be considered, and there are usually signals at
widely different frequencies to be incorporated in any analysis. There is
however one special property of microwave signals that is exploited, and
this is that nearly every modulated microwave signal has a relatively small
248                                              STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES

bandwidth compared to the center frequency of the signal. Thus system
simulation strategies have been developed that require only the smaller
bandwidth signal to be fully considered in analysis and bookkeeping used
to track the center frequency of the signal.

   In this chapter metrics and design techniques were introduced that enable
competitive designs to be realized quickly. Often a company may decide
that it is to their competitive advantage to design one or more of their
own modules rather than using those from module vendors. Even then,
the large number of modules available enables design concepts to be tested
for feasibility early in the design cycle. Module vendors are challenged
with designing modules with close to ultimate performance, but with
enough adaptability that the module is suited to a wide variety of system
applications. The greater customer base for modules justifies the higher
module design costs leading to acceptable unit costs and high performance.

MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: MODULES                           Third Edition

Microwave and RF Design: Modules focuses on the design of systems based on microwave modules. The
use of modules has become increasingly important in RF and microwave engineering for rapidly realizing
high performance microwave systems. When integration is ultimately to be used, building a system up using
modules provides a rapid means of prototyping and testing system concepts. A wide variety of RF modules
including amplifiers, local oscillators, switches, circulators, isolators, phase detectors, frequency multipliers
and dividers, phase-locked loops, and direct digital synthesizers are considered. Detailed design strategies
for synthesizing filters based on parallel coupled lines are presented. The reader will gain an appreciation
of design by synthesis. This book is suitable as both an undergraduate and graduate textbook, as well as a
career-long reference book.
