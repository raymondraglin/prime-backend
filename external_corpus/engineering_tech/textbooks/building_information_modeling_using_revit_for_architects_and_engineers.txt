MAVS OPEN PRESS

About Mavs Open Press

Creation of this resource was supported by Mavs Open Press, operated by the University
of Texas at Arlington Libraries (UTA Libraries). Mavs Open Press offers no-cost services
for UTA faculty, staff, and students who wish to openly publish their scholarship. The
Libraries' program provides human and technological resources that empower our
communities to publish new open access journals, to convert traditional print journals
to open access publications, and to create or adapt open educational resources (OER).
Our resources are openly licensed using Creative Commons licenses and are offered in
various e-book formats free of charge, which can be downloaded from the Mavs Open
Press OER catalog. Optional print copies of this text may be available through the UTA
Bookstore or can be purchased directly from XanEdu, Mavs Open Press' exclusive print
provider and distributor.

About OER

OER are free teaching and learning materials that are licensed to allow for revision and
reuse. They can be fully self-contained textbooks, videos, quizzes, learning modules, and
more. OER are distinct from public resources in that they permit others to use, copy,
distribute, modify, or reuse the content. The legal permission to modify and customize
OER to meet the specific learning objectives of a particular course make them a useful
pedagogical tool.

About Pressbooks

Pressbooks is an open source, web-based authoring tool based on WordPress, and it
is the primary tool that Mavs Open Press uses to create and adapt course materials.

About the Book

This book is geared towards users who have no Revit background. It starts with Revit
basics such as how to create walls, floors, roof, but it also covers more advanced topics
such as creating a complex object, preparing construction documents, and modeling
mechanical and structural systems.

   This book is an open education platform for Architecture and Civil Engineering
students to learn Revit and provides students with adequate, coherent, consistent, and
cost-saving educational resources. It includes both text and video of each chapter to
help students have access to both step-by-step written instructions and videos of each
lesson because software instructions are mostly narratives and difficult for students to
visualize the procedures and follow the instructions.

   BIM is one of the most recent developments influencing the architecture,
engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. BIM provides the opportunity to improve
poor communication and information sharing among building owners, architects,
engineers, builders, and public authorities. It enhances collaboration among project
teams and improves AEC performance by decreasing project cost, increasing
productivity and quality, and reducing project delivery time. Students pursuing a
degree in a related field should gain knowledge and skills about BIM and its tools.

   The book is composed of 15 chapters covering various topics. Each chapter starts with
the basics of creating elements and builds on students' previous knowledge and takes
them further to develop BIM modeling skills using Revit. Each chapter presents a mix of
written instructions, various activities, and videos to help students with various learning
needs. Completing each chapter is the same as completing an assignment and skills
developed can be used to work on a class project defined by the course instructor or
found online.

UTA CARES Grant Program

Creation of this OER was funded by the UTA CARES Grant Program, which is sponsored
by UTA Libraries. Under the auspices of UTA's Coalition for Alternative Resources in
Education for Students (CARES), the grant program supports educators interested in
practicing open education through the adoption of OER and, when no suitable open
resource is available, through the creation of new OER or the adoption of library-
licensed or other free content. Additionally, the program promotes innovation in
teaching and learning through the exploration of open educational practices, such
as collaborating with students to produce educational content of value to a wider
community. Information about the grant program and funded projects is available
online.

Author's Note

I would like to first thank the UTA CARES Grant Program sponsored by UTA Libraries
and Michelle Reed who supported funding this project. I am also thankful to OER team
at UTA Library who have kindly helped in all steps by holding educational seminars,
answering questions, and reviewing content. This was a great experience working with
each member of the team.

   This work would not have been possible without my student assistant, Ashley Foster,
who dedicated time and effort to create illustrations, record some videos, and format
the book in pressbooks. Thank you, Ashley!

Figure 2.10 Basic Wall Exterior - EIFS on Mtl. Stud

Interior Walls
Interior Partition (1-hr)

An interior partition wall has metal studs at its core with 1 hour rated gypsum board on
both facings. The default wall sizes are 3-1/8", 4-7/8" and 5-1/2" thick.

Figure 2.11 Basic Wall Interior - 3 1/8" Partition (1-hr)

Interior Partition (2-hr)

An interior partition wall has metal studs at its core with 2 hour rated gypsum board on
both facings. The default wall sizes are 5" and 6-1/8" thick.

22 | Chapter 2: Walls, Curtain Walls, Windows and Doors
Figure 2.12 Basic Wall Interior - 5" Partition (2-hr)

Other Walls
Retaining 12" Concrete

A retaining wall is made from concrete that is cast-in-place, on-site.

Figure 2.13 Basic Wall Retaining - 12" Concrete

Soffit ½" GWB and Metal Stud

A soffit is usually the eave overhang that connects the roof back to the exterior face of
the wall. It can also be the material area underneath a balcony or other such elements.

                                                              Chapter 2: Walls, Curtain Walls, Windows and Doors | 23
Figure 2.14 Basic Wall Soffit - ½" GWB Metal Stud

Foundation Concrete

Foundation concrete is used underneath structural walls to create a soil retaining
barrier. These elements are often referred to as footings and are always thicker than the
structural wall above.

Figure 2.15 Basic Wall Foundation - 12" Concrete

Revit Curtain Walls
Curtain Wall

A glass curtain wall system is connected from the building's floor plates typically seen
on high-rise buildings. These walls do not carry any loads of floors, roofs, or structure to
the ground. The Curtain Wall type in Revit is a blank glass wall with no set parameters
as a base for grids and mullions to be designed.
24 | Chapter 2: Walls, Curtain Walls, Windows and Doors
Figure 2.16 Curtain wall in 3D view and cut in section

Exterior Glazing

Exterior Glazing has a preset grid where the parameters can be altered and designed
through the Properties Palette.

Storef ront

A storefront system is typically installed between floor plates typically low-rise and
commercial buildings. The Storefront wall option offers a ready-to-go wall with a set
grid and set mullions that can be altered and designed through the Properties Palette.

Figure 2.18 Storefront in 3D view and cut in section

Stacked Wall
Exterior Brick over CMU with Metal Stud

The Revit Stacked Wall option offers a wall built from two different materials stacked
one on top of the other. In this specific type the lower portion is a CMU block and the
top is a Brick wall tied to a metal stud wall. These walls can be modified or designed
using the Properties Palette.

Chapter 5: Adding - Modifying
Families

Families are typically small-scale elements where most files are set with given
parameters. Parameters are used to define the extent of an element. For example,
a family of windows may have parameters that define the sizes available per a
manufacturer's catalog such as 2ft X 2ft, 2ft X 4ft, 3ft X 4ft, and 3ft X 5ft.

   Revit provides several generic families of doors, windows, casework, furniture, and
more. A user can easily create custom families or downloaded files from the internet.

   A custom family file uses templates to define an elements category. Once a template
is chosen it cannot be changed later. The file will have to be recreated in a new template
because the copy-paste function does not work between families.

   Element-based - A family created using an element-based template such as "floor-
based" or "wall-based" can only be placed on that element within a project.

   Adaptive - A family created where the parameters are much more flexible and can
conform to any project's unique geometries, however, the 2D annotation options are
disabled (Text, symbols, detail components, etc).

5.3 ADD REFERENCE PLANES AND SET
PARAMETERS

Reference planes have two uses: one is used as guidelines or constructions to align
elements to a specific position and the second use is to control the form or position of
geometries. Constraints are used on geometries to bound them to reference planes,
selected dimensions, or alignments.

   In this example the tables' geometries will be aligned to placed reference planes then
constraints are set to lock the table's dimensions to set sizes.

Placing Reference Planes

 1. First, set up the user interface to view all 4 windows, In the View tab, click the Tile
      Views icon

2. In the Ref. Level view, go to the Create tab on the Ribbon then click on the
      Reference Plane icon

 3. Draw a vertical line on one side of the center reference plane and use the Mirror
      icon to create another

4. Select each reference plane and rename them Left and Right respectively
 5. Use the witness lines to change the distance to the center reference plane to 3'0"

      as shown in Figure
      5.2

90 | Chapter 5: Adding - Modifying Families
     Figure 5.2 Vertical reference planes created and labeled
6. Create one horizontal line on the left side of the center reference plane then use

     the Mirror icon to create another
7. Label them Top and Bottom respectively
8. Use the witness lines to change the distance to the center reference plane to 1'6"

     as shown in Figure 5.3

   Setting Constraints

9. Under the Modify tab, use the Aligned Dimension icon to place dimension strings
                                                                                 Chapter 5: Adding - Modifying Families | 91
      connecting the Left-Center-Right and another connecting Left-Right as shown in
      Figure 5.4 (left). Do the same for Top-Center-Bottom and Top-Bottom as shown in
      Figure 5.4 (left)
10. Select the 3' 0" dimension string and enable equal dimensions by clicking on the
      EQ as shown in Figure 5.4 (right). Do the same for the 1' 6" dimension string.

      Figure 5.4 (left) Dimension strings placed and (right) enabled EQ for 3'0" and 1'6"
      dimension strings
11. Select the 6'0 dimension string

         Click OK
14. Complete the same instructions for the 3-foot dimension

    Flexing Constraints

      "Flexing" constraints are used to test if the dimension strings act accordingly to the
      applied changes. To flex a model, the Family Type icon is used. For this example,
      assume the manufacturer of the dining table wants to offer three lengths for
      different household sizes. The 6-foot table sits 4 people, the 7-ft table sits 6 people,
      and the 8-ft table sits 8 people.
15. On the ribbon, click the Family Type icon to flex the model.
16. Change the Length to 7 feet and click Apply. If the reference planes are set
      correctly the model will reflect the changed length in the Ref. Level view.

Chapter 6: Massing - Conceptual
Mass

Massing can be used to build anything from small elements to an entire building's
masses. In this chapter, start a new project using the Architectural template. Save the
new project as "Class Project 2".

6.1 TYPES OF MASSING

In-Place Mass

An In-Place Mass is located on the ribbon under the Massing & Site tab by selecting the
In-Place Mass icon. This massing is used to create large-scale building masses where
floors, walls and roofs can be added quickly. The items created in a project through this
method are only available in this project and will not be saved as an individual family
file.

Model In-Place

The model in-place is located on the ribbon under the Architecture tab by accessing
the Component icons drop-down menu. This massing is used to build a small-scale
element that is specific to the project such as countertops shapes, wall details, or
shading systems, where the project's geometries are available to build from. The items
created in a project through this method are only available in this project and will not
be saved as an individual family file.

Conceptual Mass

A conceptual mass can be created by navigating through the File tab, New sub-menu,
and selecting Conceptual Mass. When working in a conceptual mass file, the project
does not contain other project geometries to work from. A Conceptual Mass file is
different than a Family file because massing can be quickly modeled, there is not a
list of categorized model types to choose from and it is typically used for large-scale
massing. This massing is saved as separate files and can be loaded into any project.

Field regions add patterns or hatches to help describe a material.

Masking Region

Masking regions either hide linework or fade linework using transparency.

Detail Component

A detail component is a profile family that is saved individually and uploaded into the
project such as top and bottom plates, blocking, soldier bricks, etc.

Repeating Elements

A repeating element is a time-efficient tool used to draw a repeating detail in a linear
fashion such as a regular brick, soldier bricks, grout spacing, etc.

                                                                                     Chapter 10: Details and Annotations | 155

Chapter 11: Workflow |
Worksharing

11.1 WORKFLOW

CAD and BIM users within a firm follow the same design and construction phases that
answer the what, where, and how, but the time and payroll spent in each phase varies
between the programs.

CAD versus BIM workflow

CAD

In the CAD program, there is one 2D drawing per file that is then linked into another file
for reference, so important elements align such as exterior walls or structure. Elevations
and interior wall designs are orthographically projected from linked floorplans to create
vertical information. When changes are made to a project a team member is required
to edit each file individually.

   Firms created a guide from experience on how many hours it generally takes to
complete tasks at each of the 4 design phases. When using CAD more hours are used
from the design development through the construction documentation phase.

BIM

In the BIM program, all 2D and 3D drawings are in one file where the 3D model
automatically produces all necessary plans, sections, elevation, and rendered views.
BIM uses GIS data (Geographical Information Systems) to position a project where
the environment's sun angle or average temperature can accurately predict daylight
studies, energy analysis, and material performance. For example, a wall envelope can
include the R and U values of insulation or windows to test the energy efficiency.

   Structural, MEP, and HVAC designs are typically created by an engineering firm
then linked into the architecture file. Engineering design requirements can alter the
architectural design such as codes that determine airflow or CFD (Computational fluid

                                                                                     Chapter 11: Workflow | Worksharing | 169
dynamics). A project may require the ceiling cavity to be increased to house the
appropriate HVAC system that controls the airflow.

   BIM generally uses the same number of hours from the Conceptual and Schematic
phase through the Design Development, but it offers a significant decrease in hours to
complete the Construction Document phase. When a change is made in any view of
the model whether it be 2D or 3D, all other views are adjusted simultaneously.

BIM Roles

Typically there are 3 types of employees needed to complete the construction
documentation and they are the Architect, the Model Maker, and the Draft Organizer.

The Architect

The Architect is typically the real architect in control of the project. This person oversees
the design decisions, construction feasibility, material choices, code requirements and
makes sure the project is consistent from beginning to end.

The Model Maker

The Model Maker is responsible for building the 3D model and 2D views which include
families of windows, doors, casework, structure components (in walls, floors, roofs, etc.)
and any other items accounted for in a CD set.

The Draft Organizer

The Draft Organizer takes all views from the Model Maker and the codes and
requirements from the Architect and sets up all sheets, schedules, and views then
apply detailed information such as dimensions, keynotes, and annotations.

11.2 WORKSHARING

Worksharing allows more than one user to access the same model and work
simultaneously. Users work from individual local Revit files. Each local file

170 | Chapter 11: Workflow | Worksharing
communicates to the central model that is located to a Cloud-based system under the
C:/ of each user's computer.

Install Google Drive/DropBox

Each user needs to follow these steps to locate the Google Drive in the appropriate
folder.

   The following steps are for users who have not downloaded Google Drive or DropBox
to their personal devices before. If Google Drive is already on the computer, please skip
to the next section.

     TIP

        This process works best if a new google account is created. Revit files are
     heavy and will use a lot of storage limiting a user's personal account

 1. To use Google Drive, go to https://www.google.com/drive/download/ and click the
      personal download button.

2. Follow the installation instructions
 3. When the download is complete, log in to the google account
4. Under the My Laptop tab, uncheck the Desktop, Documents, and Pictures options.
 5. On the left panel, click to open Google Drive
6. A user can sync every folder in Google Drive or just specific folders. Select the

      folders that are needed for quick access when working on a project.

            TIP

               1. Folders that sync to the hard drive do take up space on the
                   computer, only sync what is necessary to link to the project. This can
                   help reduce lagging

              2. If a new account is created, try following a folder nomenclature
                         00_Central File (save the central here)

                                                                                      Chapter 11: Workflow | Worksharing | 171
                         01_Project Families (save all family files here)
                         02_Project Masses (save all massing files here)
                         03_Project Materials (save all material, images, etc here)

 7. Change the folder location to the computers C:/ drive. This is the most important
      part because each user's folder address has to be exactly the same to access the
      project. For example C:/Google Drive/00_Central File

 8. Click OK to allow the files to sync

Relocate an existing Google Drive to the C:/

The following steps are for users who have downloaded Google Drive or DropBox
to their personal devices before. Google Drive does not allow you to change the file
location after an account has already been synced therefore you need to "Quit Back
Up and Sync".

   There are two methods to changing the file location to a Google account that is
already active on your desktop.

Option 1:

 1. Access the Google Back up and Sync that is located on the computer tool bar
 2. Select the Settings icon (3 dots)
 3. Select Quit Backup and Sync
 4. Open the File Explorer and locate the Google drive folder
 5. Copy and Paste the folder into the C:/ drive
 6. Delete the original Google Drive folder
 7. Re-open the Backup and Sync
 8. The program will prompt you to locate the missing file, select the Locate button
 9. Use the Browse for folder window to access the C:/ drive and select the new

      Google Folder
10. Another window will appear asking you to confirm this choice, select Confirm

Option 2:

 1. Access the Google Back up and Sync that is located on the Windows tool bar

172 | Chapter 11: Workflow | Worksharing
 2. Select the Settings icon (3 dots)
 3. Select Preferences
 4. Go to the Settings tab on the left of the window
 5. Click the disconnect account icon
 6. This will sign out of the account
 7. Move the Google Folder to the C:/
 8. Access the Google Back up and Sync that is located on the Windows tool bar
 9. Select the Settings icon (3 dots)
10. Select Backup and Sync
11. Sign into the account
12. Go to the Google Drive tab on the left
13. A blue underlined "Change.." will be available to choose a new location
14. Select Start to begin syncing

     TIP

     · If this does not work follow these steps
              Access the Google Back up and Sync
              Uninstall from the Add/Remove Programs
              Download using the previous instructions

Option 2:

 1. Click on the Central Model that appears in the main space of the Revit Home Page

         A window will open asking "By opening this central model, you will create a
            local copy of it"

         Choose to "Append timestamp, to existing copy" or "Overwrite existing copy"
               Timestamp creates a new timestamped file
               Overwrite saves a new local file over the existing local file

         Once the Local file is open, go to the Collaborate tab
         Click the Workset Icon
         Use the Drop-down menu under editable and choose Yes

   make edits or updates

Important notes when working from a cloud shared model

1. Always Synchronize and Relinquish Mine before closing the project
2. Assign group members model/building elements by topics such as Floors, Walls,

     Windows, Doors, Legends, Sheets, etc.
3. Save the file often without syncing to the central
4. Communicate with the other users before clicking the Synchronizing(updating)

 Only synchronize the model with the Google drive icon shows the arrow

For this section consider that an elementary school will design an addition to
accommodate an increased number of student enrollment. Revit can classify parts of
the elementary school renovation project in phases such as New, Existing, Demolished,
or Temporary.

   New Construction consists of all elements that are added to the school such as a new
foundation, walls, floors, windows, and more.

   Existing Construction consists of all elements from the original building footprint.
   Demolishing Construction classifies anything that will be taken away from the
project, such as the exterior wall torn down for the new construction to attach to.
   Temporary Construction consists of all elements used during the construction such
as fences, scaffolding or braces.

Chapter 14: Site Modeling

3D site modeling covers all elements added around the building structure including
vegetation, infrastructure, vehicles, and contouring land or topography. 2D site design
consists of property lines, topography lines, and the building pad. A building pad is
required when topography is added to a 3D model because it can cut through the
topography where a floor is not able to.

   There are 3 methods for creating topography in Revit.

  · Placing points at a specific location and assigns each point an elevation height
  · Import a CAD filed that has lines or points with assigned elevations, usually

      acquired from a GIS shapefile.
  · Import a CAD file that has been generated by a civil engineering program.

14.1 Create topography with CAD import

 1. In the Project Browser, double click Site under the Floor Plans section
 2. In the View tab, click the Import CAD icon
 3. Select the Topography file that was downloaded from Canvas
 4. Click Open

            TIP

              If the topography does not appear at the top of Level 1 change the Top
           Offset to a negative number until it is just above the floor. This example was
           adjusted to -48' 6"

 5. Open the 3D view from the Project Browser
 6. Click the Massing & Site tab
 7. Click the Toposurface icon
