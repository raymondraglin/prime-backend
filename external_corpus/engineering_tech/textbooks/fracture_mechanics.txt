Preface to the First Edition

   While teaching a course on fracture mechanics at Delft University of Technology we
discovered that although there are a few excellent textbooks, their subject matter covers
developments only up to the early 1970s. Consequently there was no systematic treat-
ment of the concepts of elastic-plastic fracture mechanics. Also the description of frac-
ture mechanics characterisation of crack growth needed updating, especially for sus-
tained load fracture and unstable dynamic crack growth.

   In the present textbook we have attempted to cover the basic concepts of fracture
mechanics for both the linear elastic and elastic-plastic regimes, and three chapters are
devoted to the fracture mechanics characterisation of crack growth (fatigue crack
growth, sustained load fracture and dynamic crack growth).

   There are also two chapters concerning mechanisms of fracture and the ways in
which actual material behaviour influences the fracture mechanics characterisation of
crack growth. The reader will find that this last topic is treated to some way beyond that
of a basic course. This is because to our knowledge there is no reference work that sys-
tematically covers it. A consequence for instructors is that they must be selective here.
However, any inconvenience thereby entailed is, we feel, outweighed by the importance
of the subject matter.

   This textbook is intended primarily for engineering students. We hope it will be use-
ful to practising engineers as well, since it provides the background to several new de-
sign methods, criteria for material selection and guidelines for acceptance of weld de-
fects.

   Many people helped us during preparation of the manuscript. We wish to thank par-
ticularly J. Zuidema, who made vital contributions to uniform treatment of the energy
balance approach for both the linear elastic and elastic-plastic regimes; R.A.H. Ed-
wards, who assisted with the chapter on sustained load fracture; A.C.F. Hagedorn, who
drew the figures for the first seven chapters; and the team of the VSSD, our publisher,
whose patience was sorely tried but who remained unbelievably co-operative.

   Finally, we wish to thank the National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and the Boiler
and Pressure Vessel Authority `Dienst voor het Stoomwezen' for providing us the op-
portunity to finish this book, which was begun at the Delft University of Technology.

                                                                                            H.L. Ewalds

Preface to the Second Edition

   In 1991, the fifth reprint of the first edition of the textbook "Fracture Mechanics", by
H.L. Ewalds and R.J.H. Wanhill, was published. Obviously the field of fracture me-
chanics has developed further since that time. A new edition was needed. The task fell
mainly to the new authors, M. Janssen and J. Zuidema, both in the Department of Mate-
rials Science at Delft University of Technology, with assistance by R.J.H. Wanhill, of
the National Aerospace Laboratory NLR. The original first author, H.L. Ewalds, indi-
cated that he no longer wished to be involved with this textbook. We respect his deci-
sion, and thank him for his major contribution to the First Edition, which has been very
successful.

   This second edition is the result of numerous revisions, updates and additions. These
were driven by the ongoing development of fracture mechanics, but also by teaching the
course on fracture mechanics at Delft University of Technology. The fracture mechanics
parameters K, G and J are now treated in a more basic manner. Test methods for JIc and
for crack arrest toughness are updated. The development of failure assessment based on
elastic-plastic fracture mechanics is reflected in a comprehensive treatment. On the
subject of subcritical crack growth more attention is paid to the important topic of the
initiation and growth of short fatigue cracks.

   Throughout the book some paragraphs are typeset in a smaller font. This text is in-
tended to provide additional background information on certain subjects, but is not con-
sidered essential for a basic understanding.

   We would like to acknowledge the assistance of colleagues in preparing this second
edition. With critical reading and profound discussions A.R. Wachters helped consid-
erably in drawing up the part on the J integral. G. Pape did the preparatory work neces-
sary for updating the chapter on dynamic fracture. A. Bakker contributed to the treat-
ment of the R6 failure assessment procedure. Finally, A.H.M. Krom provided useful
comments and suggestions on various subjects.

   The authors wish to thank our publisher, J.E. Schievink of the VSSD, for his encour-
agement and co-operation in creating this new edition.

An Overview

1.1 About this Course

   This course is intended as a basic grounding in fracture mechanics for engineering
use. In order to compile the course we have consulted several textbooks and numerous
research articles. In particular, the following books have been most informative and are
recommended for additional reading:
· D. Broek, "Elementary Engineering Fracture Mechanics", Martinus Nijhoff (1986)

   The Hague;
· J.F. Knott, "Fundamentals of Fracture Mechanics", Butterworths (1973) London;
· Richard W. Hertzberg, "Deformation and Fracture Mechanics of Engineering Mate-

   rials", John Wiley and Sons (1988) New York;
· T.L. Anderson, "Fracture Mechanics, Fundamentals and Applications", CRC Press

   (1991) Boston.
Four international journals are also recommended:
· Fatigue and Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures;
· International Journal of Fatigue;
· International Journal of Fracture;
· Engineering Fracture Mechanics.

   As indicated in the table of contents the course has been divided into five parts. Part
I, consisting of this chapter, is introductory. In Part II the well established subject of
Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) is treated, and this is followed in Part III by
the more recent and still evolving topic of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM).
In Part IV the applicability of fracture mechanics concepts to crack growth behaviour is
discussed: namely subcritical, stable crack growth under cyclic loading (fatigue) or
sustained load, and dynamic crack growth beyond instability. Finally, in Part V the
mechanisms of fracture in actual materials are described together with the influence of
material behaviour on fracture mechanics-related properties.

1.2 Historical Review

   Strength failures of load bearing structures can be either of the yielding-dominant or
fracture-dominant types. Defects are important for both types of failure, but those of
primary importance to fracture differ in an extreme way from those influencing yielding
and the resistance to plastic flow. These differences are illustrated schematically in fig-
ure 1.1.
4  Introduction

   For yielding-dominant failures the significant defects are those which tend to warp
and interrupt the crystal lattice planes, thus interfering with dislocation glide and pro-
viding a resistance to plastic deformation that is essential to the strength of high strength
metals. Examples of such defects are interstitial and out-of-size substitutional atoms,
grain boundaries, coherent precipitates and dislocation networks. Larger defects like in-
clusions, porosity, surface scratches and small cracks may influence the effective net
section bearing the load, but otherwise have little effect on resistance to yielding.

   Figure 1.1. Types of structural failure.

   For fracture-dominant failures, i.e. fracture before general yielding of the net section,
the size scale of the defects which are of major significance is essentially macroscopic,
since general plasticity is not involved but only the local stress-strain fields associated
with the defects. The minute lattice-related defects which control resistance to plastic
flow are not of direct concern. They are important insofar as the resistance to plastic
flow is related to the material's susceptibility to fracture.

   Fracture mechanics, which is the subject of this course, is concerned almost entirely
with fracture-dominant failure. The commonly accepted first successful analysis of a
fracture-dominant problem was that of Griffith in 1920, who considered the propagation
of brittle cracks in glass. Griffith formulated the now well-known concept that an exist-
ing crack will propagate if thereby the total energy of the system is lowered, and he as-
sumed that there is a simple energy balance, consisting of a decrease in elastic strain en-
ergy within the stressed body as the crack extends, counteracted by the energy needed to
create the new crack surfaces. His theory allows the estimation of the theoretical
strength of brittle solids and also gives the correct relationship between fracture strength
and defect size.
1. An overview  5

   The Griffith concept was first related to brittle fracture of metallic materials by Zener
and Hollomon in 1944. Soon after, Irwin pointed out that the Griffith-type energy bal-
ance must be between (i) the stored strain energy and (ii) the surface energy plus the
work done in plastic deformation. Irwin defined the `energy release rate' or `crack
driving force', G, as the total energy that is released during cracking per unit increase in
crack size. He also recognised that for relatively ductile materials the energy required to
form new crack surfaces is generally insignificant compared to the work done in plastic
deformation.

   In the middle 1950s Irwin contributed another major advance by showing that the
energy approach is equivalent to a stress intensity (K) approach, according to which
fracture occurs when a critical stress distribution ahead of the crack tip is reached. The
material property governing fracture may therefore be stated as a critical stress intensity,
Kc, or in terms of energy as a critical value Gc.

   Demonstration of the equivalence of G and K provided the basis for development of
the discipline of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). This is because the form of
the stress distribution around and close to a crack tip is always the same. Thus tests on
suitably shaped and loaded specimens to determine Kc make it possible to determine
what cracks or crack-like flaws are tolerable in an actual structure under given condi-
tions. Furthermore, materials can be compared as to their utility in situations where
fracture is possible. It has also been found that the sensitivity of structures to subcritical
cracking such as fatigue crack growth and stress corrosion can, to some extent, be pre-
dicted on the basis of tests using the stress intensity approach.

   The beginnings of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM) can be traced to fairly
early in the development of LEFM, notably Wells' work on Crack Opening Displace-
ment (COD), which was published in 1961. In 1968 Rice introduced an elastic-plastic
fracture parameter with a more theoretical basis: the J integral. Although both COD and
J are now well established concepts, EPFM is still very much an evolving discipline.
The reason is the greater complexity of elastic-plastic analyses. Important topics are:

· the description of stable ductile crack growth (tearing),
· the development of failure assessment methods that combine the effects of plasticity

   and fracture.

   As opposed to using the above-mentioned global fracture mechanics parameters,
fracture problems are also increasingly being tackled by means of local fracture criteria.
Here the mechanical conditions that actually exist in the crack tip region are being de-
termined and are being related to the material properties.

1.3 The Significance of Fracture Mechanics

   In the nineteenth century the Industrial Revolution resulted in an enormous increase
in the use of metals (mainly irons and steels) for structural applications. Unfortunately,
there also occurred many accidents, with loss of life, owing to failure of these struc-
tures. In particular, there were numerous accidents involving steam boiler explosions
and railway equipment.
6  Introduction

   Some of these accidents were due to poor design, but it was also gradually discov-
ered that material deficiencies in the form of pre-existing flaws could initiate cracking
and fracture. Prevention of such flaws by better production methods reduced the number
of failures to more acceptable levels.

   A new era of accident-prone structures was ushered in by the advent of all-welded
designs, notably the Liberty ships and T-2 tankers of World War II. Out of 2500 Liberty
ships built during the war, 145 broke in two and almost 700 experienced serious fail-
ures. Many bridges and other structures also failed. The failures often occurred under
very low stresses, for example even when a ship was docked, and this anomaly led to
extensive investigations which revealed that the fractures were brittle and that flaws and
stress concentrations were responsible. It was also discovered that brittle fracture in the
types of steel used was promoted by low temperatures. This is depicted in figure 1.2:
above a certain transition temperature the steels behave in a ductile manner and the en-
ergy required for fracture increases greatly.

   Figure 1.2. Schematic of the general effect of temperature on the fracture energy of structural
                  metals.

   Current manufacturing and design procedures can prevent the intrinsically brittle
fracture of welded steel structures by ensuring that the material has a suitably low tran-
sition temperature and that the welding process does not raise it. Nevertheless, service-
induced embrittlement, for example hydrogen embrittlement in the petrochemical in-
dustries, irradiation effects in nuclear pressure vessels and corrosion fatigue in offshore
platforms, remains a cause for concern.

   Looking at the present situation it may be seen from figure 1.3 that since World War
II the use of high strength materials for structural applications has greatly increased.

   These materials are often selected to obtain weight savings -- aircraft structures are
an obvious example. Additional weight savings have come from refinements in stress
analysis, which have enabled design allowables to be raised. However, it was not recog-
nised until towards the end of the 1950s that although these materials are not intrinsi-

cally brittle, the energy required for fracture is comparatively low, as figure 1.2 shows.
The possibility, and indeed occurrence, of this low energy fracture in high strength ma-
terials stimulated the modern development of fracture mechanics.

   The object of fracture mechanics is to provide quantitative answers to specific prob-
lems concerning cracks in structures. As an illustration, consider a structure containing
pre-existing flaws and/or in which cracks initiate in service. The cracks may grow with
time owing to various causes (for example fatigue, stress corrosion, creep) and will gen-
erally grow progressively faster, figure 1.4.a. The residual strength of the structure,
which is the failure strength as a function of crack size, decreases with increasing crack
size, as shown in figure 1.4.b. After a time the residual strength becomes so low that the
structure may fail in service.

   Figure 1.4. The engineering problem of a crack in a structure.

   With respect to figure 1.4 fracture mechanics should attempt to provide quantitative
answers to the following questions:
1. What is the residual strength as a function of crack size?
2. What crack size can be tolerated under service loading, i.e. what is the maximum

   permissible crack size?
3. How long does it take for a crack to grow from a certain initial size, for example the

   minimum detectable crack size, to the maximum permissible crack size?
8                      Introduction

4. What is the service life of a structure when a crack-like flaw (e.g. a manufacturing
   defect) with a certain size is assumed to exist?

5. During the period available for crack detection how often should the structure be in-
   spected for cracks?

   This course is intended to show how fracture mechanics concepts can be applied so
that these questions can be answered.

   In the remaining sections 1.4  1.11 of this introductory chapter an overview of the
basic concepts and applications of LEFM and EPFM are given in preparation for more
detailed treatment in subsequent chapters.

   Figure 1.5. A through-thickness crack in a loaded infinite plate.

1.4 The Griffith Energy Balance Approach

   Consider an infinite plate that is subjected to a uniform tensile stress, V, applied at in-
finity (see figure 1.5). Suppose that we introduce a through-thickness crack of length 2a.
In the area directly above and below the crack the stress (in the loading direction) will
decrease significantly and will even become zero along the crack flanks. Hence intro-
duction of the crack changes the elastic strain energy stored in the plate. We can roughly
estimate this change by assuming that in a circle-shaped area of radius a around the
crack the stress has become zero, while the remainder of the plate experiences the same
stress as before. In this case the elastic energy in the plate has decreased by an amount
equal to the volume of the stress-free material times the original elastic energy per unit
volume, i.e. ½×stress×strain. Assuming linear elastic material behaviour, i.e. a Young's
modulus E, the elastic energy change would be1:

   Sa2·V2 = 1 SV2a2 .                                                 (1.1)
        2E 2 E

Obviously, this is only an approximation because the stress field becomes non-

   per unit thickness.
                        1. An overview  9

homogeneous near the crack, as will be shown in chapter 2. Griffith used a stress analy-
sis developed by Inglis to show that for an infinite plate the elastic energy change is ac-
tually given by

        SV2a2                           (1.2)
Ua =  E ,

where Ua = change in the elastic strain energy of the plate caused by introducing a
                crack with length 2a. The minus sign shows this change is a decrease in
                elastic energy.

   The introduction of a crack will require a certain amount of energy. Griffith assumed
that for ideally brittle materials this is in the form of surface energy. A crack with length
2a in a plate involves the creation of a crack surface area (defined per unit thickness)
equal to 2·(2a) = 4a, leading to an increase in surface energy of

UJ = 4a·Je ,                            (1.3)

where UJ = change in surface energy of the plate due to introduction of a crack with
                length 2a,

        Je = surface energy per unit area, i.e. the surface tension.

   Griffith postulated that a crack will extend when the potential energy decreases. He
considered the surface energy as a part of this potential energy. In practice the energy
involved in creating crack surfaces will not be reversible due to several reasons (oxida-
tion etc.) and strictly speaking is not part of the potential energy. However, as long as
only growing cracks are considered, the irreversibility of the surface energy is not rele-
vant. Here, the potential energy according to Griffith will be referred to as the total en-
ergy.

   For a real plate, i.e. one with finite dimensions, the total energy U is that of the plate
and its loading system. When a crack is present the total energy U is composed of

U = Uo + Ua + UJ - F ,                  (1.4)

where Uo = total energy of the plate and its loading system before introducing a crack
                (a constant),

        F = work performed by the loading system during the introduction of the crack
                = load × displacement.

The combination of plate and loading system is assumed to be isolated from its sur-
roundings, i.e. no work is performed on the plate or on the loading system from outside.
This explains why F must be subtracted in equation (1.4): if the loading system per-
forms work it goes at the expense of the energy content of the loading system and there-
fore lowers the total energy U. A more extensive treatment will be given in section 4.2.

   In this introductory chapter we will conveniently assume that no work is done by the
loading system. This is the case if the specimen is loaded by a constant displacement, a
10                          Introduction

so-called fixed grip condition. Then the term F in equation (1.4) will vanish. Introducing
a crack now leads to a decrease in elastic strain energy of the plate, i.e. Ua is negative,
because the plate loses stiffness and the load applied by the fixed grips will drop. A
plate with finite dimensions resembles an infinite plate when 2a << W, the plate width.
Consequently, the total energy U of a finite plate loaded with fixed grips and containing
a small crack is approximately

                                   SV2a2                       (1.5)
    U = Uo + Ua + UJ = Uo - E + 4aJe .

   Following Griffith, crack extension will occur when U decreases. In order to formu-

late a criterion for crack extension, we consider an increase of the crack length by d(2a).
Since Uo is constant, it will not change and dUo/d(2a) is zero. Also, since no work is
done by the loading system, the driving force for crack extension can be delivered only

by the decrease in elastic energy dUa due to the crack length increase d(2a). The crack
will extend when the available energy dUa is larger than the energy required dUJ. Thus
the criterion for crack extension is

    dU d                             d § SV2a2  ·
    d(2a) = d(2a) (Ua + UJ) < 0  or         ¨-  + 4aJe¸ < 0 .  (1.6)
                                     d(2a) © E         ¹

   This is illustrated in figure 1.6. Figure 1.6.a schematically represents the two energy
terms in equation (1.6) and their sum as functions of the introduced crack length, 2a.
Figure 1.6.b represents the derivative, dU/d(2a). When the elastic energy release due to
a potential increment of crack growth, d(2a), outweighs the demand for surface energy
for the same crack growth, the introduction of a crack will lead to its unstable propaga-
tion.

   From the criterion for crack extension, equation (1.6), one obtains

    SV2a
    E > 2Je ,                                                  (1.7)

which can be rearranged to

              V a > 2EJe . (1.8)
                             S

   Equation (1.8) indicates that crack extension in ideally brittle materials is governed
by the product of the remotely applied stress and the square root of the crack length and
by material properties. Because E and Je are material properties the right-hand side of
equation (1.8) is equal to a constant value characteristic of a given ideally brittle mate-
rial. Consequently, equation (1.8) indicates that crack extension in such materials occurs
when the product V a attains a certain critical value.

               tions.

1.5 Irwin's Modification to the Griffith Theory

   Irwin designated the left-hand side of equation (1.7) as the energy release rate, G,
representing the energy per unit new crack area that is available for infinitesimal crack
extension.2 The right-hand side of equation (1.7) represents the surface energy increase
per unit new crack area that would occur owing to infinitesimal crack extension and is
designated the crack resistance, R. It follows that G must be larger than R before crack
growth occurs. If R is a constant, this means that G must exceed a critical value Gc = R
= constant. Thus fracture occurs when

SV2a
G = E > Gc = R = 2Je .                           (1.9)

The critical value Gc can be determined by measuring the critical stress Vc required to
fracture a plate with a crack of size 2a or by measuring the critical crack size 2ac needed

2 The crack area is defined as the projected area, normal to the crack plane, of the newly formed sur-
   faces.
12                          Introduction

to fracture a plate loaded by a stress V.
   In 1948 Irwin suggested that the Griffith theory for ideally brittle materials could be

modified and applied to both brittle materials and metals that exhibit plastic deforma-
tion. A similar modification was proposed by Orowan. The modification recognised that
a material's resistance to crack extension is determined by the sum of the surface energy
Je and the plastic strain work Jp (both per unit crack surface area) that accompany crack
extension. Consequently, in this case the crack resistance is

    R = 2(Je + Jp) .                                   (1.10)

For relatively ductile materials Jp >> Je, i.e. R is mainly plastic energy and the surface
energy can be neglected.

   Although Irwin's modification includes a plastic energy term, the energy balance ap-
proach to crack extension is still limited to defining the conditions required for instabil-
ity of an ideally sharp crack. Also, the energy balance approach presents insuperable
problems for many practical situations, especially slow stable crack growth, as for ex-
ample in fatigue and stress corrosion cracking.

   The energy balance concept will be treated in more detail in chapter 4.

Figure 1.7. Stresses at a point ahead of a crack tip.

1.6 The Stress Intensity Approach

   Owing to the practical difficulties of the energy approach a major advance was made
by Irwin in the 1950s when he developed the stress intensity approach. First, from linear
elastic theory Irwin showed that the stresses in the vicinity of a crack tip take the form

    Vij = K fij(T) + ... ,                             (1.11)
            2Sr

where r, T are the cylindrical polar co-ordinates of a point with respect to the crack tip,
figure 1.7.
                     1. An overview  13

K is a quantity which gives the magnitude of the elastic stress field. It is called the stress
intensity factor.3 Dimensional analysis shows that K must be linearly related to stress
and directly related to the square root of a characteristic length. Equation (1.8) from
Griffith's analysis indicates that this characteristic length is the crack length, and it turns
out that the general form of the stress intensity factor is given by

K = V Sa · f(a/W) ,                  (1.12)

where f(a/W) is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the geometries of the speci-
men and crack, and V is the (remotely) applied stress. For an infinite plate with a central
crack with length 2a, f(a/W) = 1 and thus K = V Sa. For this case we also have G =
SV2a/E, see equation (1.9). Combining the two formulae for K and G yields the relation:

     K2                              (1.13)
G= E ,

which Irwin showed to be valid for any geometry.
   Since K = V Sa for a central crack in an infinite plate, it follows from the result of

Griffith's energy balance approach, equation (1.8), that crack extension will occur when
K reaches a certain critical value. This value, Kc, is equal to 2EJe or, after applying
Irwin's modification, 2E(Je + Jp). The criterion for crack extension in terms of K is

K = V Sa > Kc .                      (1.14)

   The parameter governing fracture may therefore be stated as either a critical energy
release rate, Gc, or a critical stress intensity, Kc. For tensile loading the relationships
between Gc and Kc are

      Kc2                            (1.15)
Gc = E .

   The value of the critical stress intensity Kc can be determined experimentally by
measuring the fracture stress for a large plate that contains a through-thickness crack of
known length. This value can also be measured by using other specimen geometries, or
else can be used to predict critical combinations of stress and crack length in these other
geometries. This is what makes the stress intensity approach to fracture so powerful,
since values of K for different specimen geometries can be determined from conven-
tional elastic stress analyses: there are several handbooks giving relationships between
the stress intensity factor and many types of cracked bodies with different crack sizes,
orientations and shapes, and loading conditions. Furthermore, the stress intensity factor,
K, is applicable to stable crack extension and does to some extent characterize processes
of subcritical cracking like fatigue and stress corrosion, as will be mentioned in section
1.10 of this chapter and in greater detail in chapters 9 and 10.

3 The stress intensity factor is essentially different from the well-known stress concentration factor. The
   latter is a dimensionless ratio that describes the increase in stress level relative to the nominal stress.
14                        Introduction

   It is the use of the stress intensity factor as the characterizing parameter for crack
extension that is the fundamental principle of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics
(LEFM). The theory of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics is well developed and will be
discussed in chapter 2.

1.7 Crack Tip Plasticity

   The elastic stress distribution in the vicinity of a crack tip, equation (1.11), shows
that as r tends to zero the stresses become infinite, i.e. there is a stress singularity at the
crack tip. Since structural materials deform plastically above the yield stress, there will
in reality be a plastic zone surrounding the crack tip. Thus the elastic solution is not un-
conditionally applicable.

   Irwin considered a circular plastic zone to exist at the crack tip under tensile loading.
As will be discussed in chapter 3, he showed that such a circular plastic zone has a di-
ameter 2ry, figure 1.8, with

          1 § K ·2                                          (1.16)
    ry = ¨ ¸ ,

         2S ©Vys¹

where Vys is the yield stress.
   Irwin argued that the occurrence of plasticity makes the crack behave as if it were

longer than its physical size -- the displacements are larger and the stiffness is lower
than in the elastic case. He showed that the crack may be viewed as having a notional
tip at a distance ry ahead of the real tip, i.e. in the centre of the circular plastic zone (see
figure 1.8). Beyond the plastic zone the elastic stress distribution is described by the K
corresponding to the notional crack size. As shown in figure 1.8, this elastic stress dis-
tribution takes over from the yield stress at a distance 2ry from the actual crack tip.

   Since the same K always gives the same plastic zone size for materials with the same

Figure 1.8. The crack tip plastic zone according to Irwin.
                1. An overview  15

yield stress, equation (1.16), the stresses and strains both within and outside the plastic
zone will be determined by K and the stress intensity approach can still be used. In
short, the effect of crack tip plasticity corresponds to an apparent increase of the elastic
crack length by an increment equal to ry.

   A plastic zone at the tip of a through-thickness crack will inevitably tend to contract
in the thickness direction along the crack front. If the plate thickness is of the order of
the plastic zone size or smaller, this contraction can occur freely and a plane stress state
will prevail. On the other hand, if the plate thickness is much larger than the plastic zone
size, contraction is constrained by the elastic material surrounding the plastic zone. The
strain in the thickness direction will then be small, meaning that a plane strain state is
present.4

   The occurrence at the crack tip of either a plane stress or plane strain state has a large
effect on the plastic behaviour of the material. In plane strain the plastic deformation
occurs only when the stresses amply exceed the yield stress. Actually, equation (1.16) is
valid for a plane stress state only. For plane strain

      1 § K ·2                  (1.17)
ry = ¨ ¸ ,

     2S ©CVys¹

where C is usually estimated to be about 1.7. Thus in plane strain the plastic zone size is
considerably smaller.

1.8 Fracture Toughness

   From sections 1.6 and 1.7 it follows that under conditions of limited crack tip plas-
ticity the parameter governing tensile fracture can be stated as a critical stress intensity,
Kc. The value of Kc at a particular temperature depends on the amount of thickness con-
straint and thus on specimen thickness. It is customary to write the limiting value of Kc
for maximum constraint (plane strain) as KIc.5

   KIc can be considered a material property characterizing the crack resistance, and is
therefore called the plane strain fracture toughness. Thus the same value of KIc should
be found by testing specimens of the same material with different geometries and with
critical combinations of crack size and shape and fracture stress. Within certain limits
this is indeed the case, and so a knowledge of KIc obtained under standard conditions
can be used to predict failure for different combinations of stress and crack size and for
different geometries.

   Kc can also be determined under standard conditions, and the value thus found may
also be used to predict failure, but only for situations with the same material thickness
and constraint.

4 In all formulae up to this point a plane stress state was implicitly assumed.
5 The subscript I refers to the loading mode where the crack flanks are pulled straight apart (see section

   2.1). In fracture mechanics it is customary to include this subscript in expressions that contain the

   stress intensity factor as a variable, i.e. KI. However, in this introductory chapter this is not yet done.
16              Introduction

    As an introductory numerical example of the design application of LEFM, consider the equation for a
through-thickness crack in a wide plate, i.e.

    K = V Sa .                (1.18)

Assume that the test results show that for a particular steel the Kc is 66 MPa m for the plate thickness
and temperature in service. Using equation (1.18) a residual strength curve for this steel can be con-
structed relating Kc and nominal stress and crack size. This is shown in figure 1.9. Also assume that the
design stress is 138 MPa. It follows from equation (1.18) and figure 1.9 that the tolerable crack size
would be about 145 mm. For a design stress of 310 MPa the same material could tolerate a crack size of
only about 28 mm. Note from figure 1.9 that if a steel with a higher fracture toughness is used, for exam-
ple one with a Kc of 132 MPa m, the permissible design stress for a given crack size is significantly in-
creased. Thus a material with a higher fracture toughness permits a longer crack at a given stress or a
higher stress at a given crack length.

1.9 Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics can deal with only limited crack tip plasticity, i.e.
the plastic zone must remain small compared to the crack size and the cracked body as a
whole must still behave in an approximately elastic manner. If this is not the case then
the problem has to be treated elasto-plastically. Due to its complexity the concepts of
Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM) are not so well developed as LEFM theory,
a fact that is reflected in the approximate nature of the eventual solutions.

   In 1961 Wells introduced the crack opening displacement (COD) approach. This ap-
proach focuses on the strains in the crack tip region instead of the stresses, unlike the
stress intensity approach. In the presence of plasticity a crack tip will blunt when it is
loaded in tension. Wells proposed to use the crack flank displacement at the tip of a
blunting crack, the so-called crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) as a fracture pa-
rameter (see figure 1.10).

   Even for tougher materials exhibiting considerable plasticity critical CTOD values
could be defined corresponding to the onset of fracture. Such critical CTOD values

could then be used to qualify the materials concerned for a given application. However,
initially it proved difficult to determine the required CTOD for a given load and ge-
ometry or alternatively to calculate critical crack lengths or loads for a given material.

   In 1968 Rice considered the potential energy changes involved in crack growth in
non-linear elastic material. Such non-linear elastic behaviour is a realistic approxima-
tion for plastic behaviour provided no unloading occurs in any part of the material. Rice
derived a fracture parameter called J, a contour integral that can be evaluated along any
arbitrary path enclosing the crack tip, as illustrated in figure 1.11. He showed J to be
equal to the energy release rate for a crack in non-linear elastic material, analogous to G
for linear elastic material.

 Figure 1.11. J contour integral along arbitrary path * enclosing a crack tip in non-linear elastic
                  material. W is strain energy density along *, n is outward-directed unit vector
                  normal to *, T is traction acting on * and u is the displacement along *.

   For simple geometries and load cases the J integral can be evaluated analytically.
However, in practice finite element calculations are often required. In spite of this J has
found widespread application as a parameter to predict the onset of crack growth in
elastic-plastic problems. Later it was found that J could also be used to describe a lim-
ited amount of stable crack growth.

   In chapter 6 the background to the J and COD approaches are discussed, while
chapter 7 deals with the procedures to measure critical values of these parameters in

actual materials. In chapter 8 some specific aspects of EPFM are discussed.

1.10 Subcritical Crack Growth

   In section 1.7 it was mentioned that the stress intensity factor can still be used when
crack tip plasticity is limited. This latter condition holds for some important kinds of
subcritical crack growth, where most of the crack extension usually takes place at stress
intensities well below Kc and KIc. In particular the stress intensity approach can provide
correlations of data for fatigue crack growth and stress corrosion cracking.

Fatigue

Consider a through-thickness crack in a wide plate subjected to remote stressing that
varies cyclically between constant minimum and maximum values, i.e. a fatigue loading
consisting of constant amplitude stress cycles as in figure 1.12. The stress range 'V =
Vmax  Vmin, and from equation (1.18) a stress intensity range may be defined:

    'K = Kmax - Kmin = 'V Sa .                                               (1.19)

   The fatigue crack growth rate is defined as the crack extension, 'a, during a small
number of cycles, 'n, i.e. the growth rate is 'a/'n, which in the limit can be written as
the differential da/dn. It has been found experimentally that provided the stress ratio, R
= Vmin/Vmax, is the same then 'K correlates fatigue crack growth rates in specimens
with different stress ranges and crack lengths and also correlates crack growth rates in

specimens of different geometry, i.e.

    da                                                                       (1.20)
    dn = f('K,R) .

This correlation is shown schematically in figure 1.13. Note that it is customary to plot

da/dn  'K data on a double logarithmic scale. The data obtained with a high stress
range, 'Vh, correspond to a lower critical crack length and commence at relatively high
values of da/dn and 'K. The data for a low stress range, 'Vl, commence at lower values
of da/dn and 'K, but reach the same high values as in the high stress range case. The

data frequently show a sigmoidal trend, and this will be discussed in chapter 9 together

with additional aspects of fatigue crack growth.
Stress Corrosion
It has also been found that stress corrosion cracking data may be correlated by the stress
intensity approach. Figure 1.14 gives a generalised representation of the stress corrosion
crack growth rate, da/dt, as a function of K, where t is time.

 Figure 1.14. Stress corrosion crack growth rate as a function of K.
20  Introduction

   The crack growth curve consists of three regions. In regions I and III the crack ve-
locity depends strongly on KI, but in region II the velocity is virtually independent of KI.
Regions I and II are most characteristic. Region III is often not observed owing to a
fairly abrupt transition from region II to unstable fast fracture. In region I there is a so-
called threshold stress intensity, designated KIscc, below which cracks do not propagate
under sustained load for a given combination of material, temperature and environment.
This threshold stress intensity is an important parameter that can be determined by time-
to-failure tests in which pre-cracked specimens are loaded at various (constant) stress
intensity levels, thereby failing at different times as shown schematically in figure 1.15.

   The subject of stress corrosion cracking, under the more general heading of sustained
load fracture, will be examined further in chapter 10.

1.11 Influence of Material Behaviour

   So far, this overview of the use of fracture mechanics to characterize crack extension
has not taken account of actual material behaviour, the influence of which may be con-
siderable. For example, the fracture toughness of a material is much less when crack
extension occurs by cleavage instead of ductile fracture. Cleavage is an intrinsically
brittle mode of fracture involving separation of atomic bonds along well-defined crys-
tallographic planes.
Other examples of material behaviour that affect fracture properties are:
1. Cracking of second phase particles in the metallic matrix and formation of micro-

   voids at particle/matrix interfaces.
2. Anisotropic deformation and fracture. This may be intrinsic (crystallographic) as in

   the case of cleavage, or may result from material processing (texture).
3. Choice of fracture path, i.e. whether transgranular or intergranular, or a mixture of

   both.
1. An overview  21

4. Crack blunting and branching.

In fact, fracture often depends on combinations of such types of material behaviour. For
this reason we consider that a basic course in fracture mechanics should include infor-
mation concerning mechanisms of fracture and the influence of material behaviour on
fracture mechanics-related properties. These topics are considered in chapters 12 and
13.

The Elastic Stress
Field Approach

2.1 Introduction
   In the overview given in chapter 1 it was stated that the stress intensity factor K de-

scribes the magnitude of the elastic crack tip stress field. Also, K can be used to describe
crack growth and fracture behaviour of materials provided that the crack tip stress field
remains predominantly elastic. This correlating ability makes the stress intensity factor
an extremely important fracture mechanics parameter. For this reason its derivation is
treated in some detail in section 2.2.

   All stress systems in the vicinity of a crack tip may be divided into three basic types,
each associated with a local mode of crack surface displacements, figure 2.1. In what
follows the derivation of elastic stress field equations will be limited to mode I, since
this is the predominant mode in many practical cases. Once this derivation is understood
it is possible to obtain a number of useful expressions for stresses and displacements in
the crack tip region. However, use of the stress intensity factor approach for practical
geometries does involve some difficulties. For example, actual cracks may be very ir-
regular in shape as compared to the often highly idealised cracks considered in theoreti-
cal treatments. Moreover, assumptions such as the infinite width of a sheet or plate

   Figure 2.1. The three modes of crack surface displacements.
26  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

frequently cannot be maintained if an accurate result is required. The consequences of
necessary deviations from the theoretical solutions will also be discussed in this chapter.

2.2 Derivation of the Mode I Elastic Stress Field Equations

   This section gives an overview of the derivation of the mode I stress field equations.
More rigorous treatments may be found in references 1 and 2 of the bibliography at the
end of this chapter. The derivation covers the following topics:

· the concepts of plane stress and plane strain;
· the equilibrium equations of stress;
· the compatibility equation of strain;
· Airy stress functions;
· a general introduction to complex functions;
· Westergaard complex stress functions;
· the case of a biaxially loaded plate;
· the mode I stress intensity factor.

Finally, some additional remarks are made concerning the derivation and the stress in-
tensity concept.

Plane Stress - Plane Strain
For an isotropic material the 3-dimensional form of Hooke's law can be written as:

    Hx = E1 {Vx  Q(Vy + Vz)} ,        1+Q
                                Hyz = E Wyz ,

    Hy = E1 {Vy  Q(Vz + Vx)} , Hzx = E 1+Q Wzx , (2.1)

    Hz = E1 {Vz  Q(Vx + Vy)} ,        1+Q
                                Hxy = E Wxy .

     where Vx, Vy, Vz = normal stress components
          Wyz, Wzx, Wxy = shear stress components
              Hx, Hy, Hz = normal strain components
          Hyz, Hzx, Hxy = shear strain components 1
                       E = Young's modulus
                       Q = Poisson's ratio.

   Fracture mechanics mostly deals with 2-dimensional problems, in which case no
quantity depends on the z co-ordinate. Two special cases are plane stress and plane
strain conditions, which are respectively defined as:

1 Sometimes shear strains are expressed as Jyz = Wyz/G etc., where G is the shear modulus. It then follows
   that Jyz = 2Hyz, etc. and G = E/2(1+Q)
              2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach             27

Plane stress                Plane strain

Vz = Wyz = Wzx = 0 ,        Hz = Hyz = Hzx = 0 .               (2.2)

For these conditions the in-plane components of equations (2.1), i.e. those not involving
the z coordinate, can be expanded as:

                                                    ©   ¹

From this it can be seen that the strains in the plane strain case can be derived from the

strains in the plane stress case as follows:
                     E

1) replace E by 2 ,
                   1Q

2) replace Q by Q 1Q .

The reverse, i.e. transforming from plane strain to plane stress, is also possible. To do
this, we first have to separate a factor E/(1Q2) and replace it by E. Next, Q must be re-
placed by Q/(1+Q). For example, the transition of Q for a plane stress o plane strain o
plane stress cycle reads:

Q              Q/1+Q
Q o 1Q o 1  Q/1+Q ( = Q) .

These transitions apply only to the expressions for the in-plane components. The thick-
ness stress Vz and thickness strain Hz follow from:

Plane stress                         Plane strain

Vz = 0 ,                             Vz = Q(Vx+Vy) ,           (2.4)
       Q                             Hz = 0 .

Hz = E (Vx+Vy) ,

   The plane stress l plane strain transitions enable the separate expressions for plane
stress and plane strain conditions, equations (2.3), to be written in a concise manner:
28       Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

    Hx = 1Ec (Vx  QcVy) ,                                                            (2.5)
    Hy = 1Ec (Vy  QcVx) ,
    Hxy = 1+Qc Ec Wxy ,

              where Ec = E and Qc = Q for plane stress,
                 and Ec = E/(1Q2) and Qc = Q/(1Q) for plane strain.

Equilibrium Equations of Stress
From figure 2.2 it can be seen that there is an equilibrium of forces in the x direction if:

§ wVx ·  § wWxy ·                                   § wWxz ·
¨Vx+ dx¸ dydz  Vxdydz + ¨Wxy+ dy¸ dzdx  Wxydzdx + ¨Wxz+ dz¸ dxdy  Wxzdxdy = 0.
© wx ¹   © wy ¹                                     © wz ¹

Analogous formulae follow from the equilibrium of forces in the y and z directions.

Figure 2.2. The stress components acting in the x direction on an infinitesimal material ele-
               ment.

This leads to the equilibrium equations of stress:

    wVx + wWxy + wWxz = 0 ,
    wx wy wz

    wVy + wWyz + wWyx = 0 ,                                                          (2.6)
    wy wz wx

    wVz + wWzx + wWzy = 0 .
    wz wx wy
          2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach      29

If we confine ourselves to the two-dimensional cases of plane stress and plane strain, for
which Wzy = Wzx = 0 and w/wz = 0, the equilibrium equations (2.6) reduce to:

wVx + wWxy = 0 ,
wx wy

wVy wWyx                                            (2.7)

wy + wx = 0 .

Compatibility Equation of Strain

Again we consider only the 2-dimensional case. Small strains in the x-y plane can be
expressed in terms of the displacements in the x and y direction, U and V respectively,
according to:

     wU           wV       §wV wU·
Hx = , Hy = , Hxy = ½ ¨ + ¸ .                       (2.8)
     wx           wy       ©wx wy¹

Obviously, the three strain components are determined by only two displacement com-
ponents U and V. Therefore, the three strain components cannot be independent. An extra
relation must exist between them. This relation is the compatibility equation of strain
and is obtained by eliminating U and V through differentiation of equations (2.8):

w2Hx w2Hy w2Hxy                                     (2.9)
wy2 + wx2 = 2wxwy .

Using equations (2.5) the compatibility equation can also be expressed in terms of stress
components:

w2                w2                         w2Wxy
    (VxQcVy) + 2(VyQcVx)  2(1+Qc) = 0 ,             (2.10)
wy2               wx                         wxwy

where again Qc = Q for plane stress
               Qc = Q/(1Q) for plane strain

Airy Stress Functions

Any stress field solution for an elastic problem must fulfil both the equilibrium and the
compatibility equations. For this purpose, Airy introduced a way of describing two-
dimensional stress fields using a function )(x,y):

     w2)              w2)  w2)
Vx = 2 , Vy = 2 , Wxy =  .                          (2.11)
     wy               wx   wxwy

Straightforward substitution shows that this stress field

· always fulfils the equilibrium equations of stress (2.7);
· only fulfils the compatibility equation (2.10) if the stress function ) is a solution of

   the so-called biharmonic equation:
30                           Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

    w4) w4) w4) 4 + 2 2 2 + 4 = 0 or 22) = 4) = 0 .                 (2.12)
    wx wx wy wy

A function )(x,y) that fulfils the biharmonic equation and defines a stress field accord-
ing to equations (2.11) is called an Airy stress function. Both equilibrium of stress as
well as compatibility of strain are guaranteed. Note that Airy stress functions are real
and have the dimension of force.

A General Introduction to Complex Functions
A complex function f(z), where z is a complex variable, is called analytic if its deriva-
tive fc(z) exists. The consequence of this definition is that if a primitive of f(z) exists,
then this primitive is also analytic.

   For an analytic function the Cauchy-Riemann equations can be derived. Defining
z = x + i·y, we may write:

              wf df wz df
              wx = dz wx = dz = fc(z) ,

              wf df wz df
              wy = dz wy = dz·i = i·fc(z)

and therefore

    wfwx = wRe f(z) wx + i·wIm f(z) wx = fc(z) ,

    wfwy = wRe f(z) wy + i·wIm f(z) wy = i·fc(z) .

Eliminating fc(z), leads to

       §wRe f(z) wIm f(z)· wRe f(z) wIm f(z)
    i·¨             + i·     ¸=                   + i·        .
       © wx                  wx ¹ wy                    wy

Now the Cauchy-Riemann equations follow as

    wRe f(z) wx = wIm f(z) wy , wRe f(z) wy = wIm f(z) wx .         (2.13)

   In the Cauchy-Riemann equations the real or the imaginary part of f(z) can be elimi-
nated. For example, equations (2.13) can be differentiated as follows:

    w2Re f(z) w2Im f(z) w2Re f(z) w2Im f(z)
                    =        ,       2 =                         .  (2.14)
               wx2     wxwy      wy                     wxwy

Consequently:
                        2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach              31

       w2Re f(z) w2Re f(z)
                  + 2 =0
       wx2              wy

or

       2Re f(z) = 0.                                                      (2.15)

An identical relation can be derived for Im f(z) by eliminating Re f(z). It is said that
Re f(z) and Im f(z) are conjugate harmonic functions. They both satisfy Laplace's equa-
tion:

       2Re f(z) = 2Im f(z) = 0 .                                          (2.16)

Westergaard Complex Stress Functions

Westergaard (reference 1) introduced a specific type of Airy stress function ) using an
analytic complex stress function I(z) of which the first and second order integrals are
assumed to exist:

                  -             -
       ) = Re I(z) + y·Im I(z) ,                                          (2.17)

               --
       where I(z), I(z) = first and second order integrals (primitives) of I(z) respectively

                   and z = x + i·y .

For ) to qualify as an Airy stress function it must fulfil the biharmonic equation (2.12).
                                              -

Note that ) has a real value. Because I(z) is itself an analytic function, it is obvious that
                                  -

the first part of (2.17), Re I(z), is a harmonic function fulfilling Laplace's equation
(2.16) and thus also the biharmonic equation (2.12). For the second part of equation
(2.17) we consider the function y·M, where M is harmonic, i.e. 2M = 0:

    2  w2(yM) w2(yM) w § wM· w § wM· w2M wM wM w2M wM
 (y·M) = 2 + 2 = ¨y ¸ + ¨M + y ¸ = y 2 + + + y 2 = 2 .
       wx            wy wx © wx¹ wy © wy¹ wx wy wy wy wy

Thus:

       22               2§ wM· w 2
         (y·M) =  ¨2 ¸ = 2  M = 0 .
                        © wy¹ wy

Consequently, the function ) defined in terms of the complex stress function I(z) intro-
duced by Westergaard does qualify as an Airy stress function.

   Now we can express the stress components Vx, Vy and Wxy in terms of the complex
stress function I(z). For example Vx becomes:

       Vx = 2

    = Re I(z)  y·Im I c(z) .                                       (2.18.a)

Use has been made of the Cauchy-Riemann equations (2.13). The components Vy and
Wxy can be derived analogously, leading to:

    Vy = Re I(z) + y·Im I c(z) ,                                   (2.18.b)

    Wxy =  y·Re I c(z) .                                           (2.18.c)

These expressions have a general nature, i.e. they give the stress components for any
(Westergaard) complex stress function I(z). The stress field solution corresponding to a
particular two-dimensional elastic problem is found by choosing the stress function I(z)
in such a way that all boundary conditions are fulfilled. Note that using a Westergaard

complex stress function limits the boundary conditions for problems that can be solved.
From equations (2.18) it is easily seen that for y = 0 it is required that Vx = Vy and Wxy =
0.

Biaxially Loaded Plate

We will consider an infinite plate containing a crack. The plate is biaxially loaded in

tension by a stress Vf (see figure 2.3). The boundary conditions for this problem are:

1) Vy = 0                 for a < x < +a and y = 0,
2) Vx o Vf and Vy o Vf    for x o ±f and/or y o ±f,
                          for x = ±a and y = 0.
3) Vy o f

The first condition arises from the fact that the crack flanks are free surfaces. The

Figure 2.3. A biaxially loaded infinite plate containing a crack.
               2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach    33

second condition states that at an infinite distance from the crack the stress will be equal

to the applied stress Vf. The last condition accounts for the stress raising effect of a
crack. At a crack tip with zero radius the stress Vy becomes singular.

   We have to find a function I(z) such that Vx and Vy, defined according to equations
(2.18), fulfil the above boundary conditions. A function that does this is:

I(z) =   Vf .                                          (2.19)
        1  a2/z2

In the following the boundary conditions are checked:
1) If y = 0 it follows that z = x and thus:

I(z) = I(x) =      2 Vf = i·   Vf .
               1©§a /x2  1¹·  a2/x2  1

Therefore, as |x| < a along the crack flanks, the function I(z) is purely imaginary, i.e.
Re I(z) = 0. Consequently:

          Vy = Re I(z) + y·Im I c(z) = 0 .

2) For x o ±f and/or y o ±f, i.e. |z| o f, equation (2.19) becomes I(z) = Vf. Be-
   cause now Im I(z) = 0, it follows that:

             Vx = Vy = Re I(z) = Vf .

3) For z = ±a we obtain I(z) o f. So at the crack tips (y = 0, thus z = x) we get:

             Vy = Re I(z) o f .

The Mode I Stress Intensity Factor

It will prove convenient to translate the origin of the co-ordinate system to the crack tip
at z = +a by introducing the variable K = z  a. The complex stress function I(z) now
becomes:

I(K) =       2V =      V(a + K)                        (2.20)
        1  a /(a+K)2  (a + K)2 a2 .

Note that the suffix f is now omitted from Vf. Near the crack tip, i.e. |K| << a, the stress
function may be approximated as:

I(K) | Va = V     a2 K1/2 .                            (2.21)
          2aK

In polar co-ordinates, i.e. K = r eiT, we may write:
34              Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

    I(K) = V a2 r1/2e1/2iT = V Sa 2Sr e1/2iT .                                    (2.22)

In order to calculate the stress components using equations (2.18), the first derivative
I c(z) is required too:

    I c(K) = V  a2 ·1/2K3/2 = V       a ·1/2( r eiT) 3/2 = V Sa ·e3/2iT .         (2.23)
                                      2         2r 2Sr

Using r eiT = r(cosT + i·sinT), the expressions that appear in equations (2.18) may be
written as:

    Re I(K) = V Sa cosT/2 ,
                   2Sr

    Re I c(K) = 2rV Sa 2Sr cos3T/2 ,

    y·Im I c(K) = r sinT· V Sa 2r 2Sr sin3T/2 = V Sa 2Sr sinT/2 cosT/2 sin3T/2 .

After substitution we obtain the three stress components near the tip of a crack in a bi-
axially loaded plate:

    Vx = V Sa cos T/2(1  sin T/2 sin 3T/2) ,

            2Sr

    Vy = V Sa cos T/2(1 + sin T/2 sin 3T/2) ,                                     (2.24)

            2Sr

    Wxy = V Sa sin T/2 cos T/2 cos 3T/2 .
             2Sr

These expressions show that the stress components tend to infinity at the crack tip (r =
0), a so-called 1/ r singularity. The intensity of this stress singularity is given by the
factor V Sa, while the remaining parts of equations (2.24) are functions of the geomet-
rical position relative to the crack tip. The intensity of the stress singularity is called the

mode I stress intensity factor, KI. For the configuration considered here, a biaxially
loaded infinite plate, this factor is equal to V Sa, and thus depends only on the remote
stress and the crack length.

Some Additional Remarks

1) The foregoing derivation is only one of the methods for obtaining the stress field
   solution. There are several other, more general methods.
    2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach                                          35

2) The case of a plate uniaxially loaded in the y direction cannot be solved using the
   complex Westergaard stress function, since then it is required that Vx = Vy for y = 0,
   cf. equations (2.18). However, Irwin argued that this problem can be solved if the
   remote stress V is subtracted from the expression for Vx, equation (2.18.a), see refer-
   ence 3. Then by using the complex stress function I for the biaxial case, equation
   2.19, the boundary conditions for the uniaxial case are satisfied. Thus the stress field
   in a uniaxially loaded plate is identical to that in a biaxially loaded plate with the ex-
   ception of Vx, which is reduced by the remote stress V. In the near tip stress field,
   equations (2.24), this correction is usually omitted because near the crack tip Vx is
   much larger than V.

3) Owing to the approximation made in equation (2.21) these equations only apply to
   the stress field near the crack tip (r << a). For example, equations (2.24) suggest that
   if r o f, the stress components Vx and Vy approach zero instead of V (the applied
   load).

4) The stress in the proximity of the crack tip induced by a mode I load may be written
   as the product of a stress intensity factor and a geometrical function. Using the index
   notation (see section 6.3) we can write

    Vij = KI·fij(r,T) .                                                           (2.25)

Since in linear elastic material stresses are additive, multiple mode I loads will cause
a total stress equal to:

    (Vij)total = (Vij)1 + (Vij)2 + ... = (KI)1·fij(r,T) + (KI)2·fij(r,T) + ... .  (2.26)

Consequently, as the geometrical functions are identical for all mode I loads, we may
write:

    (Vij)total = {(KI)1 + (KI)2 + ...}·fij(r,T)

or

    (Vij)total = (KI)total·fij(r,T) ,                                             (2.27)

   where (KI)total = (KI)1 + (KI)2 + ... .

   This is the principle of superposition: the total mode I stress intensity can be ob-
   tained by simply adding all mode I stress intensities caused by individual loads.
5) The stress field described by equations (2.24) only applies to cracks with infinitely
   sharp tips (see 3rd boundary condition). For a crack with a finite tip radius U, i.e. a
   blunted tip (figure 2.4), Creager and Paris obtained the following expressions by
   shifting the origin of the co-ordinate system over a distance of U/2 behind tip, see
   reference 4:
36              Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

   At the blunted crack tip itself (T = 0, r = U/2), it follows that:
   · Vx = 0, which is obvious in view of the fact that the tip is a vertical free surface,

  · Vy = 2KI/ 2SU/2, which is a non-singular (i.e. finite) value.

   These values clearly differ from the singular values at a sharp crack tip. On the other
   hand, for distances much greater than the tip radius (r >> U/2) the stress values near
   the blunted crack approach those for a sharp crack. This means that expressions

   (2.24) for an infinitely sharp crack are also valid in the neighbourhood of a blunted

   crack.

       Note that when we differentiate the first of the equations (2.28) with respect to r

   for T = 0, i.e. along the positive x axis, we find a maximum value for Vx at a distance
   U from the tip.
6) Using equations (2.28) we can examine the relation between the stress intensity fac-

   tor K and the stress concentration factor. The latter describes the increase in stress

   level, relative to the nominal stress, owing to a stress concentration. Using the stress

   Vy at the blunted tip, it follows that:

    Vy = 2KI SU = 2V Sa SU  the stress concentration factor = Vy V = 2              a . (2.29)
                                                                                    U

    Inglis (reference 5) analysed the case of a small elliptical hole in a large plate loaded
    perpendicular to the major axis by a remote tensile stress V. He derived the stress at
         2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach     37

the tip of the major axis, Vtip, as:

   § 2a· §                               a·
Vtip = V ¨1 + b ¸ = V ¨1 + 2 ¸ ,                  (2.30)
   ©     ¹©                              U ¹

     where 2a, 2b = major and minor axes of the ellipse respectively,
                   U = radius of curvature of ellipse at the tip of its major axis = b2/a.

An elliptical hole with a minor axis small compared to the major axis resembles a
blunted crack. The radius U is small compared to the major axis. The stress concen-
tration factor may now be approximated by:

Vtip | 2 a for U << a .                           (2.31)
V     U

This is consistent with the expression derived using the stress intensity factor, equa-
tion (2.29).

2.3 Useful Expressions

   In this section some useful expressions for stresses and strains in the crack tip region
will be given, namely

· The mode I stress field in terms of principal stresses:
   The use of principal stresses is convenient when considering yield criteria in order to
   estimate plastic zone sizes, as will be discussed in chapter 3.

· The elastic displacement field:
   The elastic displacement field enables calculation of the stored elastic energy (used
   in energy balance approaches, chapter 4) and also serves as a basis for displacement
   controlled fracture criteria, e.g. COD (chapter 7).

· The stress field for modes II and III:
   These expressions are required for studying crack problems in which mode II or
   mode III loading or combined mode loading apply.

Principal Stresses

Using Mohr's circle construction (figure 2.5), we can express the in-plane principal
stresses V1 and V2 in terms of the stress components Vx, Vy and Wxy:

       Vx + Vy   §Vy  Vx· 2 2
V1,2 = 2 ±      ¨©2¹                     ¸ + Wxy  (2.32)

Substitution of equations (2.24) gives:

V1 = KI cosT/2(1 + sinT/2)                        (2.33.a)

        2Sr
38       Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

    V2 = KI cosT/2(1  sinT/2)                           (2.33.b)

            2Sr

The remaining principal stress normal to the plane, V3, is either 0 for plane stress or
Q(V1 + V2) for plane strain, i.e.

    V3 = 2QKI cosT/2 for plane strain.                  (2.33.c)
            2Sr

    The principal directions follow from:

    Wxy                   cos3T/2
    tan 2M = (VyVx)/2 = sin3T/2            for T z 0 ,  (2.34)

               where M = angle between V1 and y axis.

Straight ahead of the crack (T = 0) the shear stress Wxy = 0, the angle M = 0° and the
principal stresses V1 and V2 are equal and also equal to Vy and Vx respectively.

Figure 2.5. Mohr's circle construction.

Elastic Displacements

The elastic displacement field around a crack can be derived from the elastic stress field
using the two-dimensional form of Hooke's law, equations (2.5), valid for either a plane
stress or a plane strain condition. For example, the strain component Hx can be written
as:

    Hx = 1Ec(Vx  QcVy) .                                (2.35)

The displacement in the x direction, U, is obtained by integrating the relation between
                     2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach                                   39

strain and displacement, equations (2.8):

            ³ ³ U = Hxdx = 1Ec (Vx  QcVy)dx .                                           (2.36)

Substituting from equations (2.18), i.e. Vx and Vy in terms of the Westergaard complex
stress function I(z), leads to:

            U = {(1Qc) Re I(z)  y (1+Qc) Im I(z)} .1-                                   (2.37.a)

            Ec

Similarly:

            1V = {2 Im I(z)  y (1+Qc) Re I(z)} .-                                       (2.37.b)

            Ec

   For the displacements near the crack tip, the approximate complex stress function
I(K) defined in equation (2.21) suffices. We have to integrate this function first in order

                                                -
to obtain the real and imaginary part of I(K):

            ³ ³ -              a2 K1/2dK = V           2 1 a 1/2 K1/2 = V Sa  2re1/2iT
                                                                              S
            I(K) = I(K)dK = V

                         -                     2r T          -                2rS sinT/2 .
                 Re I(K) = KI                     cos /2 ; Im I(K) = KI
                                               S

The real and imaginary parts of I(K) follow in a straightforward manner from its polar
representation in (2.22):

            I(K) = KI e1/2iT  Re I(K) = KI cosT/2 ; Im I(K) =  KI sinT/2 .
                2Sr                               2Sr                         2Sr

After substituting these expressions into (2.37), the elastic displacements U and V are
found. For plane stress

         U = 2 KI E r2S cosT/2(1 + sin2 T/2  Q·cos2 T/2) ,                              (2.38)

         V = 2 KI E r2S sinT/2(1 + sin2 T/2  Q·cos2 T/2) ,

while for plane strain, using Ec = E/(1Q2) and Qc = Q/(1Q),
40               Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

    U = 2(1+Q) KI E r2S cosT/2(2  2Q  cos2 T/2) ,

    V = 2(1+Q) KI E r2S sinT/2(2  2Q  cos2 T/2) .                                  (2.39)

The Crack Flank Displacement

Another useful expression is the displacement V at any position along the crack flank.
Figure 2.6 shows a schematic definition of this crack flank displacement. Expressions
(2.38) or (2.39) cannot be used for this case. The reason is that the approximate stress
function I(K) is valid only close to the crack tip. Therefore, we revert to the expression
for the vertical displacement V in terms of the complex stress function I(z):

    1V = {2 Im I(z)  y (1+Qc) Re I(z)} ,-                                          (2.37.b)

    Ec

where I(z) = complex stress function for biaxially loaded plate (eq. (2.19)) = V/         2

                                                                                   1a /z2 .

   Figure 2.6. Crack flank displacement.

                                                                                        -
It was found earlier that Re I(z) = 0 along the crack flank. To obtain Im I(z) we have to
integrate the stress function I(z):

    ³ ³ -            ³ ³ 2 V dz =

    I(z) = I(z)dz =  1  a /z2
                                         z2  a2 Vz dz = V  z2  a2 zdz = V z2  a2 .

At the crack flank y = 0 and z = x. Because |x| < a also, it follows that:

    -         x2  a2 = i·V  a2  x2       -                 a2  x2 .
    I(z) = V                          Im I(z) = V

Substitution into equation (2.37.b), using the appropriate expressions for Ec and Qc given
                                  2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach                 41
in equation (2.5), leads to the plane stress crack flank displacement:             (2.40)
                                                                                   (2.41)
              V = 2VE a2  x2
and the plane strain crack flank displacement:

              V = 2V(1Q2) a2  x2 .

The Stress Field Equations for Modes II and III

The stress field equations for mode II and mode III loading may be obtained in a similar

manner to that outlined in section 2.2 for mode I. The results are (reference 6):

 Mode II     ­Vx = KII 2Sr sin T/2 (2 + cos T/2 cos 3T/2)                          (2.42)

2.4 Finite Specimen Width

   The solution for the stress intensity factor in section 2.2 is strictly valid only for an
infinite plate. The geometry of finite size specimens has an effect on the crack tip stress
field, and so expressions for stress intensity factors have to be modified by the addition
of correction factors to enable their use in practical problems. A general form for such a
modified expression is

KI = CV Sa · f(a/W) ,                                                              (2.44)

where C and f(a/W) have to be determined by stress analysis. There are very few closed
form solutions to equation (2.44). Most expressions are obtained by numerical approxi-
mation methods.

   As illustrations of the effect of finite geometry the derivation of modified expres-
sions based on the solution for an infinite, remotely loaded plate will be discussed in
some detail. These expressions concern the centre cracked specimen and the single and
double edge notched specimens. (A compendium of these and additional expressions for
a number of well known specimen geometries is given in section 2.8.)
42             Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

Figure 2.7. The finite width centre cracked specimen.

The Centre Cracked Specimen
The specimen geometry is depicted in figure 2.7. For this specimen there are several ex-
pressions for the stress intensity factor, e.g.

    KI = V Sa SaW tan©¨ W ¹ §Sa¸· .                          (2.45)

Equation (2.45) is the stress intensity factor analytically obtained by Irwin for one of a

row of collinear cracks with interspacing W in an infinite plate (see reference 3). How-
ever, as long as a/W is sufficiently small, this can be considered a good approximation
to a finite width centre cracked specimen: the accuracy is better than 5% for a/W d 0.25.

   A virtually exact numerical solution was obtained by Isida. The geometric correction
factor f(a/W) was derived as a 36 term power series! However, Brown found a 4 term
approximation to this power series with 0.5% accuracy for a/W d 0.35. This approxima-
tion is

    §a·        §a·                   §a·2              §a·3

    ©¹         ©¹                    ©¹                ©¹

Another, purely empirical, correction factor is due to Feddersen. As an approximation to
Isida's results he suggested that

    KI = V Sa     §Sa·                                       (2.47)
               sec¨ W ¸ .

                  ©¹

This remarkably simple expression is accurate to within 0.3% for a/W d 0.35.
   Figure 2.8 compares all the correction factors mentioned above in a graphical repre-

sentation.

Edge Notched Specimens
The geometries of single and double edge notched specimens are given in figure 2.9.

   In remark 2 appended to section 2.2 it was stated that the elastic stress field for a uni-
axially loaded plate can be obtained using the complex stress function I(z) for a biaxi-
ally loaded plate after subtracting the remote stress V from the expression for Vx, equa-
tion (2.18.a). Along the crack flanks, where a < x < a and y = 0, the function I(z) is
purely imaginary. Equation (2.18.a) now yields Vx = 0 for a biaxially loaded plate and

   Figure 2.9. The single and double edge notched specimens.
44               Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

thus there are compressive stresses Vx = V acting along the crack flanks in a uniaxially
loaded plate.

   These compressive stresses have a closing effect on the crack in a centre cracked
specimen. This closing effect is absent in the case of edge cracks, since Vx at the free
edge must be zero. Therefore, for equal crack length a and stress V, the edge crack
shows a larger crack opening at the edge than a central crack does in the middle. Thus
there is a stress raising effect of the free edge. This effect has been estimated to be about
12%, i.e. an increase of V by 12% would be needed to obtain the same crack opening for
a central crack. Thus for an edge crack:

    KI = 1.12V Sa .                                                        (2.48)

   For longer cracks the finite geometry results in stress enhancement. Correction fac-
tors have to take both the free edge effect and finite geometry effect into account. This
is reflected in the following very accurate expressions.

2.5 Two Additional Important Solutions for Practical Use

   Besides the centre cracked and single and double edge notched geometries there are
two other geometries which are important owing to their common occurrence in prac-
tice. These are:
· crack-line loading,
· elliptical cracks, either embedded or intersecting free surfaces. Elliptical cracks at

   free surfaces may be semi- or quarter-elliptical in shape.

Crack-line Loading

Consider a crack loaded by a point force as in figure 2.10. This is known as crack-line
loading. Expressions for the stress intensity factors at crack tips A and B can be ob-
tained by an analysis similar to that in section 2.2. The result in terms of the force per
unit thickness, P, is:

         P        a+x  ; KIB =         P        ax.               (2.51.a)
KIA =                                           a+x
                  ax                   Sa
         Sa

For a centrally located force (x = 0)

       P                                                          (2.51.b)
KI = .

        Sa

Therefore for constant P an increase in crack length results in a decrease in stress inten-
sity.

   From equations (2.51.a) a stress intensity factor solution for a crack under internal
pressure can be derived. Redefining P as the internal pressure, the point force per unit
thickness in equation (2.51.a) is equal to Pdx. Integration yields:

              a   a + x dx =                a   a+x+  a  x·
                  ax                            ax          ¸ dx

 = Sa P ³         a  x Sa ¬                     ¼0

               0

Note that since the pressure P is a force per unit area the result in equation (2.52) is the
same as that obtained by end loading, KI = V Sa.

   The usefulness of solutions for crack-line loading is twofold:

1) Expressions for point forces can be applied to cracks at loaded holes, e.g. riveted and
   bolted plates, provided that the holes are not too large with respect to the crack.
46                Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

2) Integration of point force solutions to obtain expressions for cracks under internal
   pressure is particularly useful for analysing internal part-through wall thickness
   cracks in e.g. pressure vessels and piping. The solutions are also important for
   through wall thickness cracks when there is a break in a pressure vessel or a pipe
   filled with a gas. At the moment of breakage the full gas pressure must be assumed
   to work on the crack flanks.

Elliptical Cracks

Actual cracks often initiate at surface discontinuities or corners in structural compo-
nents. If the components are fairly thick the cracks generally assume semi- or quarter-
elliptical shapes as they grow in the thickness direction, for example as in figure 2.11. A
knowledge of stress intensity factors for these geometries is thus of prime importance
for practical application of LEFM.

Figure 2.11. Semi-elliptical and quarter-elliptical cracks.

   As a first step, Irwin derived an expression for the mode I stress intensity factor of an
embedded slit-like elliptical crack. The loading situation is shown schematically in fig-
ure 2.12.
For this situation

Neglecting all terms beyond the second gives an accuracy of better than 5%. And so the
stress intensity factor can be approximated by

   KI varies along the elliptical crack front and has a maximum value V Sa/) at the
ends of the minor axis, a, and a minimum value V Sa2/c/) at the ends of the major

axis, c. The implication is that during crack growth an embedded elliptical crack will

tend to become circular. For an embedded circular crack

KI = 2S V Sa .                                             (2.55)

   In practice elliptical cracks will generally occur as semi-elliptical surface cracks or
quarter-elliptical corner cracks. The presence of free surfaces means that correction
factors must be added to the expressions given for embedded cracks.

   For a semi-elliptical surface crack the free front surface is generally accounted for by
adding a correction factor of 1.12. For a quarter-elliptical corner crack, which intersects
two surfaces, a correction factor of 1.2 is used. Besides these factors, corrections for
48  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

                  dimensions, according to Raju and Newman (reference 8).

cracks approaching back surfaces (analogous to corrections for finite specimen width,
section 2.4) must be considered. Back surface correction factors have been calculated by
various authors: an overview can be found in reference 7 of the bibliography. The re-
sults are often combined with front free surface and finite width correction factors.

   The best solutions available for semi-elliptical surface cracks are those based on the
finite element calculations of Raju and Newman, reference 8 of the bibliography. For
the crack of figure 2.13 Raju and Newman produced stress intensity factor solutions of

the form KI = CV Sa/) where, for W >> c the value of C depends only on a/c, a/B and

M. Values of C are also given in figure 2.13.
   Raju and Newman also developed an empirical stress intensity factor equation based

on their finite element results, reference 9 of the bibliography. For tension loading the
solution is reproduced in section 2.8. For combined tension and bending load the reader
is referred to reference 9.

2.6 Superposition of Stress Intensity Factors

   In section 2.2 it was shown that in the vicinity of the crack tip the total stress field
due to two or more different mode I loading systems can be obtained by an algebraic
summation of the respective stress intensity factors. This is called the superposition
principle.

   It should be noted that the superposition principle is valid only for combinations of
2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach  49

the same mode of loading, i.e. all mode I, all mode II or all mode III. The different
modes give different types of stress intensity factor solutions which cannot be superim-
posed.

   By using the superposition principle the stress intensity factor for a number of
seemingly complicated problems can be readily obtained. Two examples are given here.
They are:
1) A through crack under internal pressure (already derived analytically in section 2.5).
2) A semi-elliptical surface crack in a cylindrical pressure vessel.

Through Crack under Internal Pressure
The solution for this problem was already given in equation (2.52). Here the solution is
obtained by the superposition shown in figure 2.14. It is seen from this superposition
that

              KIA = KIB = KIC + KID = 0 .

Therefore

              KID = KIC = V Sa .

Substituting P = V in case D gives the required result, P Sa.
   Note that this superposition also holds when a correction for finite specimen size is

required. Such a correction, of the form f(a/W), can thus be applied to a finite width
centre cracked specimen irrespective of whether uniaxial tension is applied to the plate
or the crack is loaded by an internal pressure.

Semi-Elliptical Surface Crack in a Cylindrical Pressure Vessel
A section from a cylindrical pressure vessel with an internal semi-elliptical surface
crack is given in figure 2.15. As long as the wall thickness, B, is small compared to the
vessel radius, R, the hoop stress VH = PR/B. The maximum stress intensity factor will
generally occur at the end of the minor axis of the semi-elliptical surface crack (M =
90°). The contribution to this maximum stress intensity factor by the hoop stress is

where C can be obtained from figure 2.13 when a and c are known.
   Since the crack is in a pressurised vessel the internal pressure will also act on the

crack surfaces, with a contribution to the maximum stress intensity factor of

2.7 Some Remarks Concerning Stress Intensity Factor Determinations

   In attempting to use fracture mechanics it will often be found that there is no stan-
dard stress intensity factor solution for the particular crack shape and structural compo-
nent geometry under consideration. Recourse must be made to one of a number of
methods for obtaining the stress intensity factor. A detailed treatise of these methods is
beyond the scope of this course, but some remarks on the subject will be made here.

   Stress intensity factors are now available for many geometrical configurations and so
the first step should always be a literature search. For example, references 6 and 10 of
the bibliography and the indexes of well known journals such as the "International
Journal of Fracture" and "Engineering Fracture Mechanics" can serve as starting points.

   If no applicable solution is directly available, the next step is to assess the permissi-
ble effort to solve the problem. This effort depends on the seriousness of the problem,
the desired accuracy, computational costs and how many times the solution will be use-
ful. Limits to the amount of effort that can be justified will frequently rule out the use of
sophisticated and expensive methods such as
2. The Elastic Stress Field Approach  51

                  tors.

· finite element calculations,
· boundary integral equations,
· conformal mapping.
The interested reader will find detailed information about these methods in reference 11
of the bibliography. A strong mathematical background is essential for using these
methods.

   However, in many cases one of several more straightforward methods can be ap-
plied. These include
· the superposition principle (already discussed in section 2.6) or the very similar

   compounding method (reference 12 of the bibliography),
· the experimental fatigue crack growth method,
· the weight function method.

The Experimental Fatigue Crack Growth Method
This method generally gives reliable results. It involves comparing fatigue crack growth
rates in the configuration to be investigated with crack growth rates in standard speci-
mens of the same material fatigued under exactly the same conditions. Constant
52      Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

amplitude loading is used, since crack growth rate data are then correlatable by 'K, the

stress intensity range, as mentioned in chapter 1.
   In order to determine the stress intensity factor the assumption is made that at the

same crack growth rate da/dn, the same 'K applies to the standard specimens and the
configuration being considered (similarity or similitude principle). First it is necessary
to experimentally determine a da/dn-a relation for the unknown configuration, as shown

schematically in figure 2.16. Then, by performing a fatigue crack propagation test with
a standard specimen over a certain crack length range, da/dn-'K data must be gener-
ated. Using this, da/dn can simply be eliminated leading to a 'K-a relation. KI for the

unknown configuration can now be determined knowing both the crack length and the

load.

The Weight Function Method
From expressions for the energy release rate, G, and the relation G = K2/E (see chapter
4) it can be shown that the stress intensity factor for a particular stress distribution can
be calculated if the stress intensity factor is known for another stress distribution on the
same configuration of specimen and crack geometries. The proof of this is given in ref-
erence 13 of the bibliography. The result for mode I loading is

    2a

    ³KI = H(x,a)·V(x) dx ,                 (2.59)

           0

         where H(x,a) = * Ec wV*(x,a)
                            2KI wa

is the weight function; Ec is E for plane stress and E/(1  Q2) for plane strain; KI* is the
known stress intensity factor; V* is the displacement at the loading point, x, of the

known solution but in the direction of loading for the stress distribution to be analysed;
and V(x) is a function describing this stress distribution with reference to the stress dis-
tribution for KI*.

  A serious difficulty in using equation (2.59) is the part ³wV*/wa dx which often gives

singularities in the stress field distribution around a crack tip. A better technique is to

use special weight function solutions which give singularities only at the crack tip. Such

special weight functions have been derived by Bueckner and, in a different way, by

Paris. Discussion of these functions, including examples of their use, can be found in

references 2 and 13 of the bibliography to this chapter.

sented here. Some of these solutions have already been discussed in sections 2.4  2.6.

Crack Tip Plasticity

3.1 Introduction

   In chapter 2 the elastic stress field equations for a sharp crack, equations (2.24), were
obtained. These equations result in infinite stresses at the crack tip, i.e. there is a stress
singularity. This solution is for a crack with zero crack tip radius. However, real materi-
als have an atomic structure, and the minimum finite tip radius is about the interatomic
distance. This limits the stresses at the crack tip. More importantly, structural materials
deform plastically above the yield stress and so in reality there will be a plastic zone
surrounding the crack tip.

   Along the x-axis T = 0 and the expression for Vy in equations (2.24) gives

Vy = V Sa = KI . (3.1)
        2Sr 2Sr

By substituting the yield strength, Vys, for Vy in equation (3.1) an estimate can be ob-
tained of the distance ry over which the material is plastically deformed ahead of the

crack:

      1 § KI ·2                                                   (3.2)
ry = ¨ ¸ .

Assuming as a first approximation that the plastic zone size along the x-axis, ry,

Figure 3.1. A first approximation to the crack tip plastic zone.
62  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

corresponds to the diameter of a circular plastic zone, the distribution of Vy ahead of the
crack tip will be as shown in figure 3.1. From this figure it is clear that the assumption
is inaccurate, since part of the stress distribution (shown hatched in the figure) is simply
cut off above Vys. Also, there is no a priori reason why the plastic zone should be
circular.

   In fact it turns out to be extremely difficult to give a proper description of plastic
zone size and shape. For this reason the models most widely known from the literature
have followed one of two approaches. Either they give a better approximation of the
size but use a selected shape, e.g. the Irwin and Dugdale approaches discussed in sec-
tions 3.2 and 3.3, or they give an impression of the shape but retain the first size ap-
proximation, as in the derivations from classical yield criteria in section 3.4.

   Besides these limitations there is the problem that the state of stress, i.e. plane stress
or plane strain, will affect the plastic zone size and shape. It is well known that under
plane strain conditions yielding need not occur until the applied stress is much higher
than Vys, i.e. the plastic zone may be smaller. This and other effects of differing state of
stress will be dealt with in sections 3.5 and 3.6.

   Finally, in section 3.7 some remarks will be addressed to advanced methods of de-
termining plastic zone size and shape.

3.2 The Plastic Zone Size According to Irwin

   Irwin's analysis of plastic zone size attempts to account for the fact that the stress
distribution cannot simply be cut off above Vys as in figure 3.1. For the analysis to be
straightforward there are several restrictions:

1) The plastic zone shape is considered to be circular: however, circularity is not im-
   portant, see restriction 2.

2) Only the situation along the x-axis (T = 0 in equations (2.24)) is analysed.
3) The material behaviour is considered to be elastic  perfectly plastic, i.e. it is as-

   sumed there is no strain hardening.
4) A plane stress state is considered. As will be discussed further in section 3.5, the

   material behaviour assumed in restriction 3 now implies that stresses will not exceed
   Vys. Note that this restriction is made only for convenience. The analysis can also be
   made for a state of plane strain.

   Irwin argued that the occurrence of plasticity makes the crack behave as if it were
longer than its physical size  the displacements are longer and the stiffness is lower
than in the elastic case, i.e.

              aeff = a + 'an ,

where aeff is the effective, or notional, crack length and 'an is the notional crack incre-
ment. This increment must account for redistribution of stresses that were above Vys in
the elastic case. 'an behaves as part of the crack, but the stress Vy is equal to Vys.

    Figure 3.2. Schematic of Irwin's analysis.

   Now consider figure 3.2, which shows the Vy distribution that follows from the elas-
tic solution for a crack of length a + 'an as well as the actual Vy distribution after local
yielding. The stresses transmitted by these two distributions should be equal. This will

be the case if area I is equal to area II, i.e.

               ry

    ³ Vys·'an =    V S(a + 'an) dr  Vys · ry .                              (3.3)

or

which we can use to substitute for V a + 'an in equation (3.4). This gives

    Vys('an + ry) = 2Vys 2ry ry
                               2

and therefore

    'an + ry = 2ry .                                                        (3.6)

Thus the notional crack increment 'an is equal to the first approximation for the plastic

zone size ry.
   It follows that Irwin's analysis results in a plastic zone diameter ('an + ry) twice that

obtained as a first approximation (ry). Furthermore, this result means that the notional
crack length (a+'an) = (a + ry) extends to the centre of the circular plastic zone, figure
3.3, with a concomitant shift of the stress distribution over a distance ry with respect to
the elastic case. Note that the elastic stress distribution Vy = KI/ 2Sr takes over from
Vys at a distance 2ry ahead of the actual crack tip. Thus KI determines both the plastic
zone size, equation (3.2), and the stresses and strains outside the plastic zone (Vy =
KI/ 2Sr). It seems reasonable, therefore, that the stress intensity approach is still appli-
cable for correlating crack growth and fracture behaviour.

    Note that the expression used for KI at the notional crack length, i.e.

                 KI = V S(a + ry) ,

is only a first approximation. The reason is that

                   1 § KI ·2
              ry = 2S ¨V ¸ ,

                     © ys¹

which implies that KI and ry are mutually dependent. For this simple case, where f(a/W) = 1, the problem
can be analytically solved by simple substitution. The result is

    KI =  V Sa       2 ,                           (3.7)

          1  1§ V ·
          2 ©Vys¹

an expression that approaches the usual KI = V Sa for V << Vys. For more complicated f(a/W), however,
a numerical computation is generally necessary. If KI is not too large, only a few iterations are needed to
find a converging result for KI. At higher stresses the numerical procedure may lead to a diverging KI
value and LEFM is no longer applicable.

A Useful Expression: Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD)
In section 2.3 the crack flank displacement, V, was defined. The expression obtained for
                         3. Crack Tip Plasticity  65

plane stress was V = 2V a2  x2/E. The total Crack Opening Displacement (COD or G)
is equal to 2V, i.e. G = 4V a2 - x2/E. For this purely elastic case the Crack Tip Opening
Displacement (CTOD or Gt) would be zero, since x is ±a at the tip. As shown in figure
3.4, crack tip plasticity can be accounted for by using Irwin's proposal for an effective
crack length 2(a + ry), and considering the crack opening displacement at the actual
crack tip, i.e.

4V 2                     2 2 4V
Gt = E a + 2ary + ry  a | E 2ary .

Substitution for ry from equation (3.2) gives

     4 KI
Gt = S EVys ,

which is an approximation for the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD). This ap-
proximation will be compared in section 3.3 with the more usual expression for CTOD,
which is derived from the Dugdale approach.

    Equation (3.8) cannot be used for a situation with varying KI, as for example in fatigue. Suppose we
want to know Gt for a value of KI < Kmax, the maximum value of K during the fatigue cycle. A derivation
analogous to that leading to equation (3.8) now gives:

Gt = 4 KIKmax S EV . ys

3.3 The Plastic Zone Size According to Dugdale: The Strip Yield Model

   Dugdale's analysis assumes that all plastic deformation concentrates in a strip in
front of the crack, the so-called strip yield model. This type of behaviour does indeed
occur for a number of materials, but certainly not for all. Just as in Irwin's analysis,
Dugdale argued that the effective crack length is longer than the physical length. The
notional crack increment 'an is considered to carry the yield stress as shown in figure
3.5 (here the assumption of elastic  perfectly plastic material behaviour and a state of

plane stress is also made). Note that 'an is not defined the same way as in section 3.2.
Here 'an is the size of the total plastic zone.

   The derivation of the Dugdale formula is made in two ways:

· straightforwardly using superposition,
· formally using (complex) stress functions.

Derivation using superposition

The superposition procedure is given in figure 3.6. In a plate with a crack of physical
length 2a and plastic zone size 2'an (plate A) the same stresses and displacements are
present as in a plate with a physical crack length 2(a + 'an) where the crack is closed
over the area 2'an owing to a pressure Vys on the crack flanks (plate B). The two mode
I stress systems acting on plate B can be split into the separate mode I stress systems
shown in plates C and D. The approach is now that a finite value of Vy, i.e. Vys, is re-

quired at the notional crack tip (at a = a + 'an). In other words Vy = KIsum/ 2Sr is fi-

nite, where KIsum = KIB = KIC + KID. Because r = 0 at the notional tip, Vy would become
singular at that point unless KIsum is equal to zero. Using this knowledge, the value of

'an may be calculated as follows.
   KIC can be solved with the formulae for crack-line loading given in section (2.5).

Analogous to equation (2.52), we can write:

       a+'an

KIC =   ³ P               2(a + 'an) dx 2P(a + 'an) ª       x º a+'an

                       a

        KIC = 2Vys a+ 'an S arccos a a+ 'an ,                                  (3.9)
                                                                              (3.10)
where P = Vys was used. KID follows from:                                     (3.11)

KID = V S(a + 'an) .

Taking KIsum = KIB = KIC + KID = 0 we find:

cos SV = a or sec SV = 1 = 1 + 'an .
2Vys a + 'an                             2Vys cos SV a

                                                      2Vys

              sec x = 1 +x2 + 5x4 +....  for |x| < 2
                           2 24

and assuming V << Vys, i.e. x = SV/2Vys << S/2, only the first two terms of the expan-
sion need to be considered and we find:

       S2V2a S § KI ·2                                                        (3.12)
'an = 2 = 8 ¨V ¸ .

        8Vys © ys¹

Note that we cannot find the stress Vy (= Vys) at the crack tip from the above derivation

because Vy = KIsum/ 2Sr becomes indefinite when r goes to zero. We know only that

Vy is finite. From the derivation below, using stress functions, it is possible to obtain

more information.

Derivation using (complex) stress functions

The approach proceeds as follows:

1) Obtain a Westergaard-type stress function for a crack of length 2(a + 'an) with the
   origin at the centre of the crack. From section 2.2 a suitable function is known to be
   I1(z) = V/ 1  (a + 'an)2/z2.
68                        Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

2) Since 'an carries the yield stress, unlike a real crack, the elastic stress function I1(z)
   will overestimate the stress intensity at the notional crack tip. To obtain the correct

   estimate use is also made here of the superposition principle. Thus a stress function
   that describes the loading condition over the distance 'an must be found and this
   stress function must be subtracted from I1(z).
3) From reference 1 of the bibliography to this chapter the stress function I2(z) corre-
   sponding to two point forces P (per unit thickness) acting on both surfaces of a crack
   with length 2(a + 'an) at distances +b and b from the centre is given by:

        I2(z) =      2Pz (a + 'an)2  b2                                             (3.13)
                      2 2 2 2.
                 S z  (a + 'an) (z  b )

    Choosing a force P that corresponds to the yield stress, i.e. P = Vysdb, and by inte-
    grating I2(z), the stress function I3(z) can be obtained that describes the loading con-
    dition over 'an:

                  a+'an      2Vysz        (a + 'an)2  b2       db

        ³ I3(z) = S                       z2  b2

4) The correct stress function I4(z) = I1(z)  I3(z), i.e.

        I4(z) =           Vz        2Vys        z                  a

                                          2Vys             ­a      z2  (a+'an)2½
                                          + arccot ®                        2 2¾ .  (3.15)
                                          S                ¯z

5) Dugdale continued with the argument that a stress singularity cannot exist at the no-
   tional crack tip, since at that point the elastic stress goes no higher than the yield
   stress for an elastic  perfectly plastic material. This means that the singular terms in
   equation (3.15) must cancel each other, i.e.

                 Vz           2Vys        z arccos a = 0 ,
        z2  (a + 'an)2  S
                                    z2  (a + 'an)2             a + 'an

    so

        V  2Vys S arccos a a + 'an = 0 ,

and                                                                                (3.16)
          SV 2Vys = arccos a a + 'an or cos SV 2Vys = a a + 'an .

6) Equation (3.16) is identical to equation (3.11), which led to equation (3.12):  (3.12)

               § KI ·2
'an = 0.393 ¨ ¸ .

This is somewhat larger than the diameter of the plastic zone according to Irwin.
Irwin's analysis gives a plastic zone diameter 2ry, which from equation (3.2) is

2) The Dugdale approach has been given here in its most general form by using stress
   functions. Although this might appear unnecessarily complicated as compared to the
   more common treatment in terms of stress intensity factors as given above, there is
   an important advantage. Stress intensity factors can be used only as approximations
   consisting of singular terms. Thus in step 5) of the analysis, when all singular terms
   are required to cancel each other, the misleading impression is given that the stresses
   at the notional crack tip (the end of the plastic zone) should be zero. However, equa-
   tion (3.15) shows that there is a non-singular term

2Vys       ­a           z2  (a + 'an)2½
I5(z) = arccot ®                              2¾                                   (3.17)
S               ¯z      (a       +  'an)2    a¿

and this gives the elastic stress distribution in (V = Vys) and beyond the plastic zone.

    Equation (3.17) indeed predicts Vy = Vys in the whole of the Dugdale plastic zone, i.e. a < x < a + 'an
and y = 0. This can be seen as follows. The Taylor series for the arccot function is: arccot x = S/2  (x 
x3/3 + x5/5 ......) for |x| < 1. Therefore, the argument of the arccot in equation (3.17) is purely imaginary

within the plastic zone and has a value between 0 (for z = a + 'an) and i (for z = a). For this case equation
(3.17) may be rewritten as I5(z) = 2Vys/S arccot(p·i) with 0 < p < 1. From the Taylor series it is clear that
the real part of arccot(p·i) = S/2, because the other terms in the series have odd powers and will stay
purely imaginary. Thus Vy = Re I5(z) = Vys for a < z < a + 'an, as would be expected.

The Dugdale Approach and COD
An important aspect of the Dugdale approach in terms of stress functions is that it en-
ables a basic expression for the COD to be calculated. The crack flank displacement, V,
70                         Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

in the region between a and a + 'an can be obtained by substituting the non-singular
term in equation (3.15), i.e. I5(z) from equation (3.17), into the plane stress version of
equation (2.37.b), i.e.

          V = E{2 Im I(z)  y(1 + Q)Re I(z)} .1-

Now y = 0, since the Dugdale plastic zone is a strip yield model along the x-axis. Thus

                       --                                     (3.18)

              2 Im I 5(z)
          V= E .

   The solution of equation (3.18) is fairly difficult and beyond the scope of this course.
A full treatment is given in reference 2 of the bibliography. For our purpose it is suffi-
cient to note that an expression for the physical CTOD, Gt, is obtained by solving equa-
tion (3.18) for V and allowing z to tend to the limit a. Then

          2Vt = Gt = 8Vysa SE ln sec SV 2Vys .                (3.19)

   Equation (3.19) is the starting point for many CTOD considerations in the literature.

Further detailed attention is given to the COD concept in chapters 6, 7 and 8 of this

course, but it is here informative to compare the results from Irwin's and Dugdale's

analysis. To do this, it is convenient to first rewrite the ln sec expression in equation
(3.19). As before, the sec function may be expanded as sec x = 1 + x2/2 + 5x4/24 +... for
|x| < S/2. If V/Vys << 1, as is the case for LEFM conditions, the argument of the sec
function in equation (3.19) may expected to be much smaller than unity. Therefore we

can write

          ln(sec x) | ln¨1 + ¸ |

This value of CTOD is slightly less than that obtained via Irwin's analysis, equation

Note: Plane Stress and Plane Strain

So far, all expressions in Irwin's and Dugdale's analyses have been derived for the state
of plane stress (i.e. Vy = Vys in the plastic zone). Differences that arise owing to plane
strain conditions will be discussed in section 3.5.

3.4 First Order Approximations of Plastic Zone Shapes

   In the introduction to this chapter, section 3.1, it was mentioned that well known
models describing the crack tip plastic zone fall into two categories. Either they estimate
the size of a zone with an assumed shape, or else the shape is determined from a first
order approximation to the size. Having dealt with the first category in sections 3.2 and
3.3, we shall now turn to methods for assessing the plastic zone shape.

   The reason that a first order approximation to the plastic zone size is used in well
known models for determining the shape is that the calculations employ classical yield
criteria, e.g. those of Von Mises or Tresca, to give only the boundaries where the mate-
rial starts to yield. No account is taken of the fact that the original elastic stress distribu-
tion above Vys must be redistributed and retransmitted. The procedure is similar to that
in section 3.1, but instead of calculating ry only for T = 0, the value of ry over the range
(S d T d +S) is determined.

   Derivation of the plastic zone shape is thus simply a matter of substituting the appro-
priate stress equations into the yield criterion under consideration. Only the Von Mises
criterion will be employed here, since the Tresca criterion gives similar results. How-
ever, both plane stress and plane strain plastic zone shapes will be analysed. The plane
strain plastic zone shape is included in this section because the procedure for determin-
ing it is the same as for the plane stress case, and the result serves as a good basis for
discussing the problem of differing states of stress in section 3.5.

Plastic Zone Shapes from the Von Mises Yield Criterion
The Von Mises yield criterion states that yielding will occur when

    (V1  V2)2 + (V2  V3)2 + (V3  V1)2 = 2Vy2s ,                                                  (3.21)

where V1, V2 and V3 are the principal stresses1.
   In section 2.3 the mode I stress field equations were derived for a two-dimensional

case in terms of the principal stresses, namely

    V1 = KI cos T/2 (1 + sin T/2)                                                                (2.33.a)
            2Sr

    V2 = KI cos T/2 (1  sin T/2)                                    (2.33.b)
            2Sr

and V3 is either 0 (plane stress) or Q(V1 + V2) for plane strain. Substitution into equation
(3.21) gives for plane stress

Equation (3.22) can be made dimensionless by dividing by ry, i.e. the first order ap-
proximation to the plastic zone size for T = 0 (x-axis), equation (3.2). Then

     r(T)plane stress ry = 12 + 34 sin2T + 12 cos T .                              (3.23)

Note that for T = 0 the value of r(T) is indeed ry and for T = S/2 (y-axis) the value is
5/4 ry.

sionless form.

   Similar derivations of plastic zone shapes can be obtained for mode II and mode III
loading. Results of such derivations are given in reference 3 of the bibliography to this
chapter.

3.5 The State of Stress in the Crack Tip Region

   In section 3.1 it was mentioned that the state of stress, i.e. plane stress or plane strain,
affects the plastic zone size and shape, and figure 3.7 is a good illustration of such ef-
fects. For this reason alone it is of interest to go into some detail concerning the state of
stress in the crack tip region. However, there are additional important effects of stress
state and these will be discussed later in the present section and in section 3.6.

Through-Thickness Plastic Zone Size and Shape

Consider a through-thickness crack in a plate. From equations (2.24) we know that there
is at least a biaxial (plane stress) condition, for which the elastic stresses in the x and y
directions are given by

Vij = V Sa · fij(T) .                                 (3.25)
        2Sr

Equation (3.25) shows that for small values of r both Vx and Vy will exceed the material
yield stress. Thus a biaxial plastic zone will form at the crack tip. Assuming in the first
instance that there is a uniform state of plane stress and that the plastic zone is circular
as in Irwin's analysis, then a section through the plate in the plane of the crack gives the
situation shown in figure 3.8. With no strain hardening the material within the plastic
zone should be able to flow freely and contract in the thickness direction: however, the
adjacent (and surrounding) elastic material cannot contract to the same extent. This
phenomenon, called plastic constraint, leads to tensile stresses in the thickness direction

Figure 3.8. Schematic section in the crack plane.
74  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

on the plastic zone boundary, i.e. a triaxial stress condition which when unrelieved by
deformation would correspond to plane strain.

   In fact there is an interaction of stress states that can be described at best only semi-
quantitatively. At the plate side surface there are no stresses in the thickness direction
and so there is a biaxial condition of plane stress. Proceeding inwards there is an in-
creasing degree of triaxiality that approaches and eventually may correspond to plane
strain. Thus in a first approximation the plastic zone size and shape may be considered
to vary through the thickness of the plate. For a plate of intermediate thickness that is
neither fully in plane stress nor predominantly in plane strain these approximate varia-
tions are considerable, as indicated schematically in figure 3.9. However, the plane
stress surface regions will be more compliant than the plane strain interior, i.e. the sur-
face regions will give a larger displacement V for the same remote stress V, cf. equations
(2.40) and (2.41). Consequently, load shedding occurs from the surface regions to the
interior. This means that the plane stress and plane strain plastic zone sizes will be re-
spectively smaller and larger than those obtained from a first approximation. Indeed it
has been found by finite element analysis that the through-thickness plastic zone size
variations are much less than those indicated schematically in figure 3.9, see reference 4
of the bibliography.

   Simple calculation of the stress state distribution for a certain plate thickness is not
possible. However, there are empirical rules for estimating whether the condition is pre-
dominantly plane stress or plane strain:

1) Full plane stress may be expected if the calculated size of the plane stress plastic

   zone, i.e. 2ry in Irwin's analysis, is of the order of the plate thickness.
2) Predominantly plane strain may be expected when the calculated size of the plane

   stress plastic zone, 2ry (the approximate value at the plate surfaces), is no larger than
   one-tenth of the plate thickness.

Through-Thickness Plastic Zone Size and the Plastic Constraint Factor

In chapter 2 the mode I stress field equations were expressed in terms of principal
stresses, equations (2.33). Using these expressions we can derive the relations between
V1, V2 and V3 for plane strain conditions:

        V2 = V1 ¨§1  sin T/2· ¸

                 ¨1   +  sin  T/2¹¸
                 ©

        V3 = V1 2Q .
                 (1+sin T/2)

It is readily seen that if T = 0, then V2 = V1 and V3 = 2QV1. Assuming elastic conditions
with Q = 1/3, the Von Mises yield criterion, equation (3.21), can be used to determine the
value of V1 that is reached before yielding occurs:

                   2          2 22      2                     2
        (V1  V1) + (V1  3 V1) + (3 V1  V1) = 2Vys

and so

        V1 = V2 = 3Vys and V3 = 2Vys .

This simple analysis suggests that the ratio between V1 and the yield stress becomes as
high as 3 for plane strain. This ratio is commonly designated as the plastic constraint
factor, C.

   The first order approximation to the plane strain plastic zone size along the x-axis
can now be written as

                         1 § KI ·2                               (3.26)
        ry,plane strain = ¨ ¸ ,

                        2S ©CVys¹

which for C = 3 leads to 2

                         1
        ry,plane strain = 9 ry .

This result was already obtained in section 3.4. This plane strain value of ry must be a
considerable underestimate of the overall through-thickness plastic zone size in a plate,
since at the plate surfaces there is a state of plane stress and the plastic zone size will be

2 Unless stated otherwise, it is implicitly assumed that ry is the first order approximation for the plane
   stress plastic zone size.
76  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

ry, i.e. nine times as large. For this reason Irwin proposed that an intermediate value of 3
be used for C, such that the nominal plane strain value of ry is

                     1 § KI ·2 1        (3.27)
    ry,plane strain = 6S ¨V ¸ = 3 ry .

                        © ys¹

This value is often quoted in the literature. However, in most work pertaining to the
COD concept a value of C = 2 is used (see also chapter 6 and 7). For this constraint

                                             1

factor we find ry,plane strain = 4 ry.

Planes of Maximum Shear Stress

Besides plastic zone size and shape the state of stress also influences the locations of the
planes of maximum shear stress in the vicinity of the crack tip. This is shown in figure
3.10 together with Mohr's circle construction for the principal stresses in plane stress
and plane strain:

1) Plane stress
   For a real crack, i.e. with a finite tip radius3, Vy > Vx for T = 0, see equations (2.28).
   The principal stresses V1 and V2 are Vy and Vx respectively and V3 = Vz = 0 (it is
   customary to take V1 > V2 > V3). As can be seen from figure 3.10.a., the maximum
   shear stress, Wmax, acts on 45° planes along the x-axis.

2) Plane strain
   For a real crack in plane strain the situation is slightly more complicated. In this case
   Vy is also always larger than Vx in the vicinity of the crack tip. When we go from the
   plane stress area at the surface to the plane strain interior there is a gradual increase
   in Vz from 0 (plane stress) to Q(Vy + Vx) for pure plane strain. Because plastic defor-
   mation signifies that there is no change in volume the `plastic Q' must have a value
   of 0.5 within the plastic zone. Thus Vz is also larger than Vx. Consequently the ori-
   entation of the planes of maximum shear stress changes to 45° along the z-axis, fig-
   ure 3.10.b.

   Thus in plane stress the principal stresses V1, V2, V3 are equal to Vy, Vx, Vz, while in
plane strain they are equal to Vy, Vz, Vx. Note that the situations depicted in figure 3.10
are valid only within the relatively small region of the plastic zone. The material will
not shear off macroscopically along a plane of maximum shear stress, but will deform in
a more complex manner as will be discussed in section 3.6.

3.6 Stress State Influences on Fracture Behaviour

   In this section the effects of stress state on the macroscopic appearance of fracture
and on the fracture toughness will be discussed.

3 Assuming the crack tips to have a finite radius is legitimate since a crack will always show some
   blunting due to plastic deformation. If the crack is considered to be slit-shaped with zero crack tip ra-
   dius then equations (2.24) will apply and in plane strain Vy = V1 = Vx = V2 = Vz = 0.5 (Vx + Vy) = V3.
   Therefore all principal stresses are equal ahead of a slit crack and there is a hydrostatic stress state in
   which Wmax is zero. Note that Q = 0.5 since stresses within the plastic zone are considered.

Fracture Appearance
If a precracked specimen or component is monotonically loaded to fracture the general
appearance corresponds to that sketched in figure 3.11. Crack extension begins macro-
scopically flat but is immediately accompanied by small `shear lips' at the side surfaces.

 Figure 3.11. General appearance of monotonic overload fracture from a precrack.
78  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

 Figure 3.12. Deformation modes a) in plane strain and b) in plane stress.

As the crack extends (which it does very quickly at instability) the shear lips widen to
cover the entire fracture surface, which then becomes fully slanted either as single or
double shear. This behaviour is usually attributed to crack extension under predomi-
nantly plane strain conditions being superseded by fracture under plane stress.

   An exact model for this flat-to-slant transition is not available, but it seems obvious
that a change in the planes of maximum shear stress, see figure 3.10, plays an important
role. Experimental studies by Hahn and Rosenfield (reference 5 of the bibliography to
this chapter) indicate that under plane strain conditions a `hinge' type deformation is

followed by flat fracture, whereas under plane stress slant fracture occurs by shear after
a hinge type initiation. The two deformation modes are shown in figure 3.12.

   The occurrence of slant fracture by shear is reasonably clear from figure 3.12.b.
However, exactly how flat fracture results from hinge type deformation requires further
explanation. According to Hahn and Rosenfield flat fracture occurs by tearing of mate-
rial between the extensively deformed hinge type shear bands, figure 3.13. As to the
possible causes of tearing the reader is referred to the last chapter of this course, section
13.4.

   As an illustration, figure 3.14 shows results of tensile tests on centre cracked tension
specimens of aluminium alloy 2024. Single shear fracture occurred in a direction per-
pendicular to the loading direction, while double shear fracture occurred in a signifi-
cantly deviating direction. In the figure a transition from double to single shear can be
seen: the single shear part resumes the original crack growth direction perpendicular to
the load. More about this topic can be found in reference 6.

Fracture Toughness

The critical stress intensity for fracture, Kc, depends on specimen thickness. A typical
dependence is given in figure 3.15. Note that beyond a certain thickness, when the ma-
terial is predominantly in plane strain and under maximum constraint, the value of Kc
tends to a limiting constant value. This value is called the plane strain fracture tough-
ness, KIc, and may be considered a material property.

   The behaviour illustrated in figure 3.15 is generally ascribed to the plane stress o
plane strain transition that occurs with increasing specimen thickness. However, a com-
plete explanation for the observed effect of thickness does not exist. Also, the form of
the Kc dependence for very thin specimens (less than 1 mm) is not exactly known, hence
the dashed part of the plot. The most satisfactory model of the thickness effect is based
on the energy balance approach and will be described in chapter 4.

   Owing to the dependence of fracture toughness on specimen thickness and stress
state it is evident that experimental determination of KIc will be possible only when
specimens exceed a certain thickness. In turn this thickness will depend on the crack tip

plastic zone size, as discussed in section 3.5, and therefore on the material yield
strength. These and other aspects of plane strain fracture toughness determination and
also the obtaining of Kc for thinner specimens will be dealt with in chapter 5, which
concerns LEFM testing.

3.7 Some Additional Remarks on Plastic Zone Size and Shape
       Determination

In section 3.1 it was mentioned that it is extremely difficult to properly describe size and
shape of the plastic zone at the same time. A detailed treatise on more advanced meth-
ods that attempt to do this is beyond the scope of this course, but an indication of the re-
sults is considered to be of interest here.

   There are two general ways of tackling the problem: the experimental approach and
finite element analysis.

The Experimental Approach
The most widely known work is that of Hahn and Rosenfield (references 5 and 9 of the
bibliography to this chapter). They used specimens of silicon iron, which has the prop-
erty that plastically deformed regions can be selectively etched and made visible. Some
of the results are shown in figures 3.16 and 3.17. The specimen illustrated in figure 3.16
was in plane stress and its plastic zone shape is schematically represented in figure 3.17.
This shape is reasonably approximated by the Dugdale strip yield model. For plane
strain the plastic zones were observed to closely resemble the shape in figure 3.7, which
was derived from the Von Mises yield criterion.

   Other experimental techniques include the use of electron microscopy, references 7
and 8 of the bibliography, and optical interferometry. These techniques are used mostly

                perfectly plastic material.
82  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

to study the development of plastic zones during fatigue crack growth in order to obtain
more insight into the mechanisms of crack extension and also to check and refine crack
growth models.

Finite Element Analysis

There are various finite element analyses of plastic zone size and shape, e.g. the work of
Levy et al., reference 10 of the bibliography. Figure 3.18 depicts their estimate for a
plane strain crack tip plastic zone in an elastic  perfectly plastic material together with
the plastic zone derived in section 3.4 using the Von Mises yield criterion. It is seen that
the latter, which is a first order approximation, is significantly smaller than the more ac-
curate estimate provided by finite element analysis.

The Energy Balance
Approach

4.1 Introduction

   Besides the elastic stress field (stress intensity factor) approach there is another
method that can be used in LEFM, the energy balance approach mentioned in sections
1.4 and 1.5 of chapter 1. In section 4.2 the equations of energy balance and instability
will be given, together with the definition of the energy release rate, G, which is the pa-
rameter controlling fracture.

   In section 4.3 some important relations involving G are derived. One of these is the
relationship between G and the change in compliance (inverse of stiffness) of a cracked
specimen. This relationship has found much practical use and for that reason some ap-
plications of compliance determination are discussed in section 4.4.

   In section 4.5 the energy balance interpretation of G is again considered in order to
show its usefulness for materials exhibiting limited but significant plasticity. This leads
to the concept of crack resistance, R, and the phenomenon of slow stable crack growth
characterized by the R-curve, which is discussed in sections 4.64.8. The discussion of
crack resistance is of a general nature and includes a possible explanation of R-curve
shape and the effect of specimen thickness on fracture toughness.

   The subject of R-curves is important and extensive information on their determina-
tion and use is given in references 1 and 2 of the bibliography at the end of this chapter.
Also, the determination of R-curves is included in chapter 5, which concerns LEFM
testing.

4.2 The Energy Balance Approach

   In section 1.4 of the introduction to this course a simple energy balance derivation
has been presented. This was valid only for a specimen loaded by a constant displace-
ment, i.e. a fixed grip condition. Here the energy balance approach will be considered
for an arbitrary loading condition, followed by a more detailed treatment of the energy
release rate, G, as introduced by Irwin.

   In the energy balance approach a cracked elastic plate and its loading system are
considered. The combination of plate and loading system is assumed to be isolated from
its surroundings, i.e. exchange of work can only take place between the two. The energy
84  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

content of the plate plus the loading system, denoted as the total energy U, is written as1

    U = Uo + Ua + UJ  F ,              (4.1)

where Uo = total energy of the plate and its loading system before introducing a crack
              (a constant),

        Ua = change in the elastic energy of the plate caused by introducing a crack,
        UJ = change in surface energy of the plate due to the introduction of a crack,
         F = work performed by the loading system during the introduction of the crack

              = load × displacement.

    In order to understand why the work F must be subtracted in equation (4.1), consider a plate placed in
series with a spring between fixed grips, as shown in figure 4.1. The spring loads the plate in tension. This
represents an arbitrary loading condition, since both load and displacement of the plate will change during
the introduction of a crack. Furthermore, it is clear that no work can be performed from outside the com-
bination of spring and plate, since no external displacements are allowed.

   Figure 4.1. A cracked elastic plate in series with a spring between fixed grips and loaded in
                  tension.

When a crack is introduced, the stiffness of the plate is reduced and the plate becomes somewhat longer.
Consequently the spring becomes shorter by the same amount. During this process the spring performs an
amount of work F on the plate. This happens at the expense of the elastic energy content of the spring,
which thus decreases. Since the elastic energy content of the spring is part of the total energy U, it follows
that F must be subtracted in equation (4.1).

Potential energy
At this point we define the potential energy of an object. Potential energy is either re-
lated to the position of an object in a conservative power field or due to its state. An
evident example of the first is the potential energy of a mass which is determined by its
position (height) in a gravitational field. Elastic strain energy is an example of potential

   energies are defined per unit thickness.
                           4. The Energy Balance Approach  85

energy which is due to the state of an object. In all cases potential energy is character-
ized by its ability (potential) to perform work.

   Only part of the total energy U given by equation 4.1 has the ability to perform work.
This part will be designated as the potential energy, Up, of the elastic plate and its load-

Energy balance

In section 1.4 the total energy U of a large centre cracked plate loaded under fixed grip
conditions was considered. In general, for a centre cracked plate under arbitrary loading
conditions U will vary as a function of half crack length, a, according to the schematic
plot shown in figure 4.2. Crack growth instability will occur as soon as U decreases
with the crack length, i.e. after U has reached a maximum value. This condition is given
by

dU                                                         (4.3.a)
da < 0

or since Uo is a constant

2 In fact the term Uo need not necessarily contain potential energy only. This, however, is an academic
   discussion, since we will only consider changes in Up, and Uo is defined as a constant.

    dad (Ua + UJ  F) < 0 .                          (4.3.b)

Equation (4.3.b) can be rearranged to give:

    dad (F  Ua) > da dUJ . (4.4)

Using the potential energy defined in equation (4.2) we can rewrite equation (4.4) as
              dUp da > dUJ da . (4.5)

The left-hand side of equation (4.5) is the decrease in potential energy if the crack were

to extend by da. During this same crack extension the surface energy would increase by

an amount given by the right-hand side of equation (4.5). In other words, equation (4.5)
states that crack growth will occur when the energy available for crack extension is
larger than the energy required.

Energy release rate and crack resistance
Irwin defined the energy available per increment of crack extension and per unit thick-
ness as the energy release rate, G. When considering a central crack with length 2a, an
increment of crack extension is d(2a) and therefore:

              G = d(2a) dUp = d(2a) d (F  Ua). (4.6)

    Note that for a central crack, with length 2a, G is found by differentiating Up to d(2a), while for an
edge crack, with length a, differentiating to da would be sufficient. In both cases G is found as the nega-
tive derivative of the potential energy with respect to the newly formed crack area dA, where this area is
defined as the projection normal to the crack plane of the newly formed surfaces. This has consequences
for three-dimensional geometries: e.g. (i) an embedded circular crack, where dA = d(Sa2) = 2Sada, and
(ii) an embedded elliptical crack, where dA = d(Sac) = S(adc + cda). In fact G = dUp/dA, where the po-
tential energy Up must now be interpreted in an absolute sense, i.e. not per unit thickness, and dA is the
decrease in the net section area.

   The energy required per increment of crack extension is defined as the crack resis-
tance R:

              R = dUJ d(2a) . (4.7)

Thus equation (4.4) can be rewritten concisely as:

    G>R.                                            (4.8)

Elastic energy change in a remotely loaded centre cracked plate

In section 1.4 the expression Ua = SV2a2/E for the change in elastic strain energy
caused by introducing a central crack of length 2a in a plate was given without

derivation. At this stage in the course it is possible to check the expression for Ua by
considering crack flank displacements, figure 4.3.

   In section 2.3, equation (2.40), the plane stress flank displacement of a central crack
with length 2a in an infinite plate remotely loaded by a tensile stress, which will be
temporarily denoted as Vf, was given as

V = 2Vf E a2  x2 .                       (4.9)

Using this, we can find the change in elastic energy of the plate, Ua, by considering an
open crack with stress-free crack flanks, and calculating how much work is involved in

closing the crack. The situation of a closed crack resembles that without a crack, since
in both cases a uniform stress field Vf is present. Furthermore, closing the crack in-
creases the elastic energy by an amount equal to the work involved.

   Consider a part dx of the crack flank at a distance x from the centre of the crack. To

bring together the facing crack flank parts, each must be displaced over the distance V
given by equation (4.9). Application of a stress, V, will cause a flank displacement, [,
relative to the fully opened crack. For a flank length dx, the work involved in closing the

crack is:

         V

³2 dx V d[ = +2 dx 12 Vf V = +Vf V dx .

      0

In this calculation linear elastic material behaviour is assumed, i.e. when the stress V

increases from 0 to Vf, the displacement [ increases linearly from 0 to V. The work in-
volved in closing the whole crack is found by integrating along the crack from a to +a,
which is the same as integrating twice from 0 to +a. The change in elastic energy, Ua,
involved in creating a central crack with length 2a is the negative value of this work and

is given by:

    E¬ 2                  2           a¼0        E

For plane strain the displacement V is obtained by replacing E by E/1Q2 in equation
(4.9). Thus

    Ua = (1Q2)  S Vf2 a2  for plane strain.            (4.11)

                E

From now on we will denote the remote stress again by V, i.e. without the f suffix.
   Equations (4.10) and (4.11) are valid for an infinite remotely loaded plate. We will

now consider a plate with finite dimensions. Now it also becomes relevant what the
loading condition is. The loading condition can be described as the dependence of the

specimen load on the displacement and vice versa. Owing to crack extension the stiff-

ness of a specimen always decreases, and so either the load or the displacement, or both,
will change. Next we will consider two extreme loading conditions, namely fixed grip
and constant load.

Fixed Grip and Constant Load Conditions

In a centre cracked plate we have crack extension when, according to equations (4.6) -
(4.8),

              G = d(2a) d (F  Ua) > R = d(2a) dUJ .

A finite plate under fixed grip conditions resembles an infinite plate because no work is
performed by external forces, i.e. F = constant during crack growth. A difference is,
however, that crack extension reduces the plate stiffness and so causes the load to drop.
Knowing this, it is to be expected that for a finite plate under fixed grip conditions
dUa/d(2a) is not the same as for an infinite plate. It can be argued that in a finite plate
loaded under fixed grip conditions the change in Ua owing to crack extension ap-
proaches that of an infinite plate if the crack size 2a is small compared to the plate's
dimensions. For such a plate we can write

      d(2a)           d(2a)  ©   E  ¹   E

The surface energy, UJ, is equal to the product of the surface tension of the material, Je,
and the surface area of the crack (two surfaces with length 2a):

              UJ = 2(2aJe) .                                              (4.12)
Therefore R = dUJ/d(2a) = 2Je. Thus the criterion for crack extension is  (4.13)

                   SV2a
              G = E > R = 2Je .

Equation (4.13) is valid for a small central crack in a large plate loaded under fixed grip
conditions.

   If instead there is a condition of constant load, then crack extension results in in-
creased displacement owing to decreased stiffness of the plate. The situation is thus
more complicated than that for the fixed grip condition. To deal with this it is conven-
ient to compare crack extension in a specimen under fixed grip and under constant load
conditions. For this we refer to figure 4.4, which shows load-displacement diagrams for
specimens with crack of lengths 2a and 2(a + 'a).

   Under fixed grip conditions with a displacement V, the load on the plate will drop
from P to P + 'P (i.e. 'P < 0) when the crack extends by 'a at both tips. For a constant
load condition with a load P, the same crack extension results in a displacement from V
to V + 'V (i.e. 'V > 0). We will now consider the change in the work performed by ex-
ternal forces, 'F, and the change in elastic energy, 'Ua, involved in both cases of crack
extension. These changes are expressed in terms of areas in the load-displacement dia-

If the crack extension 'a o 0, the area IV will become negligibly small compared to
area I and '(F  Ua) will become equal for the two loading conditions. This implies that
because

    G =  d      (F  Ua) = lim  '(F  Ua)           ,

         d(2a)         'a o 0  '(2a)

the energy release rate G is the same for a finite plate loaded under fixed grip conditions
as well as under constant load conditions. Thus for both fixed grip and constant load
conditions the criterion for crack extension in a remotely loaded large plate with a small
crack is

         SV2a                                                                   (4.14)
    G = E > R = 2Je .

    It is important to note that for constant load and 'a o da we obtain:

                 dF = PdV ,
                 dUa = d(½PV) = ½PdV .
In other words, for constant load the increase in elastic energy, dUa, is equal to half the work performed
by external forces. The remaining other half is the energy available for crack extension. Thus G for con-
stant load can be written as

              GP = § wF  wUa · = +§ wUa · .
                   ©w(2a) w(2a)¹ P ©w(2a)¹ P

For fixed grip conditions dF = 0, and it follows that

              Gv = § wUa · .
                     ©w(2a)¹ V

Therefore, since G is the same for constant load and fixed grip conditions, we may write

              G = § wUa · = +§ wUa · .

4.3 Relations for Practical Use

G in a Remotely Loaded Centre Cracked Plate
In the previous section it was shown that the energy release rate, G, for infinitesimal
extension of a central crack is equal to dUa/d(2a) for constant load and to dUa/d(2a)
for fixed grips. For large plates with small central cracks G may be obtained by differ-

                                                     (4.15.a)
entiating equations (4.10) and (4.11), which gives:  (4.15.b)

plane stress  G = SV2a
                     E

plane strain  G = (1  Q2) SV2a
                               E

The Relation between G and KI

A relation of prime importance is obtained by substituting KI = V Sa, an expression
which also is valid only for a large plate with a small central crack, in the above equa-
tions:

plane stress       KI2                               (4.16.a)
              G= E

plane strain  G = KI2 (1  Q2)                        (4.16.b)
                    E

This direct relation between G and KI means that under LEFM conditions the prediction
of crack growth and fracture is the same for both the energy balance and elastic stress
field approaches. Irwin already demonstrated this equivalence, as was mentioned in
section 1.6, and showed also that equation (4.16) is geometry-independent.

G and compliance
G has been indicated to be the controlling parameter for fracture according to the energy
balance approach. It was shown that the expression for G is the same for the two most

Figure 4.5. A cracked body loaded by forces P and with total displacement V at the points of
               load application.
92                 Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

extreme loading conditions, i.e. fixed grips and constant load. However, a more general
analysis can be made, notably that of Irwin (reference 3 of the bibliography to this
chapter), by considering the compliance of a cracked body.

   Consider the cracked body shown in figure 4.5. For this edge crack the definition for
the energy release rate, G, i.e. the energy available per increment of crack extension and
per unit thickness, leads to:

          d                                                                         (4.17)
    G = da (F  Ua) .

The body has a thickness B, is loaded by a force P (here not defined per unit thickness)

and exhibits a total displacement V. Both F and Ua are defined per unit thickness. Thus
for an infinitesimal crack extension da, the change in F, dF, is equal to (PdV)/B, while
the change in Ua, dUa, is d(½PV)/B. Thus G becomes

    G = B © 1 ¨§P dadV  da ¹ d(½PV)¸· .                                             (4.18)

Introducing the compliance of the body, C, which is the inverse of its stiffness, i.e. C =
V/P, equation (4.18) becomes

    1 § d(CP) 1 d(CP2)· P2 dC
    G = B ©¨P      2                     ¸=  .                                      (4.19)
               da     da ¹ 2B da

It should be clear that G does not depend on the loading system and is the same for
fixed grip, constant load or any arbitrary loading condition. Equation (4.19) gives the
explicit relation between G and the compliance, C. This important relation is the basis,
together with equations (4.16), for using the compliance to determine stress intensity
factors for certain specimen and crack geometries. The compliance technique is an ad-
dition to those methods discussed and listed in chapter 2, section 2.7, and will be illus-
trated in the next section.

   Two remarks can be made here:

1) In this section we used the force P, acting on a material thickness B in the derivation
   of G. However we earlier defined Ua per unit thickness. If the force P were to be de-
   fined per unit thickness the formula for G would be

         P2 dC
    G = 2 da .

   This is easily found by substituting PB for P and C/B for C in equation (4.19).
2) The change of elastic energy of the cracked body, dUa/da, may be written as

    dUa 1 d(½PV) 1 § dV dP·
    =              = ¨P + V ¸ .                                                     (4.20)
    da B da 2B © da da¹

    For the constant load condition, dP/da = 0 and thus

     © wa ¹P 2B da 2B da 2B da

For the other extreme loading condition, fixed grips, where displacement is kept con-
stant, dV/da = 0 and equation (4.20) becomes

     © wa ¹V 2B da 2B da 2B © dC da¹ 2B da

Equations (4.21) and (4.22) show that for fixed grips the change in elastic energy,
dUa/da, is the opposite of that for constant load. Comparing these equations with the
expression for G, equation (4.19), it follows that

          §wUa· §wUa·                                          (4.23)

          © wa ¹P © wa ¹V

This result was already obtained at the end of section 4.2, based on the load-
displacement diagram.

4.4 Determination of Stress Intensity Factors from Compliance

From equations (4.16) and (4.19) it follows that

     2                EcP2 dC
     KI = EcG = 2B da ,                                        (4.24)

where Ec = E for plane stress and E/(1  Q2) for plane strain. This general relation en-
ables use of the compliance to determine stress intensity factors for certain specimen
and crack geometries. A well known example is the double cantilever beam specimen
(DCB) already mentioned in section 2.8 and depicted again in figure 4.6. From simple
bending theory (neglecting shear displacements) the displacement V in the load line of
the DCB specimen is given by

                  2Pa3 8Pa3
              V = 3EI = EBh3 .

Since C = V/P,

                8a3      dC 24a2
     C = EBh3 and da = EBh3 .

From equation (4.24)

     KI = EcG = Ec 2B da = E B2h3

These expressions were given in section 2.8. Note that under elastic conditions (Q |
0.33) the factor 1/ 1  Q2 gives a KI value in plane strain only 6% larger than the plane
stress value.

Notes

· For beam-type loaded specimens the crack flank displacements in the load line may
   be used instead of the exact displacements of the points of load application (shown
   schematically in figures 4.5 and 4.6). This is allowed because the bending displace-
   ments are much larger then displacements in the material due to the tensile force.
   Another advantage is that we do not need an expensive tensile testing machine, since
   crack flank displacements are usually easy to measure.

· For the double cantilever beam specimen we found the crack flank displacement V
   proportional to a3 and P. It follows that for fixed grip conditions the KI decreases
   with increasing crack length, because KI is proportional to P and a. This is an im-
   portant example of a test specimen with a decreasing KI, which has found wide-
   spread use in stress corrosion tests to find the threshold stress intensity value, KIscc
   (see chapter 10).

A Constant KI Specimen: The Tapered DCB

An interesting application of equation (4.25) is that a constant stress intensity factor
may be obtained by keeping a/B or a/h3/2 constant. The first possibility results in ta-
pered thickness, which is not very useful since there will be a gradual change in stress
state during crack growth until full plane strain is reached, equation (4.25). However,
keeping a/h3/2 constant or, still better, accounting for shear displacements by keeping
(3a2 + h2)/h3 constant, results in a constant KI specimen, the tapered double cantilever
beam (TDCB). This specimen, which is shown in figure 4.7, has been used particularly
in stress corrosion testing and will be mentioned again in chapter 10. The side grooves

are needed to keep crack growth perpendicular to the loading direction. A detailed dis-
cussion of the TDCB specimen is given in reference 4 of the bibliography to the present
chapter.

Experimental Determination of C and KI
Values of C and dC/da may be obtained experimentally as well as from theory. Load-
displacement diagrams are made for a particular type of specimen containing cracks of
different lengths, figure 4.8.a. The cracks may be extended artificially, e.g. a sawcut, or
by fatigue loading. The compliance for different crack lengths is simply V/P, so that it is
possible to construct a compliance versus crack length calibration diagram as in figure
4.8.b. From this diagram dC/da may be obtained and KI may be calculated via equation
(4.24), i.e.

                2 EcP2 dC
              KI = 2B da .

4.5 The Energy Balance for More Ductile Materials

   The expressions and methods dealt with in sections 4.3 and 4.4 are all based on G
being the controlling parameter for predicting fracture. However, G represents only the
left-hand side of equation (4.4). The right-hand side of this equation, R = dUJ/da, repre-
sents the surface energy increase owing to infinitesimal crack extension and is thus in
the first instance to be considered as identical to the crack resistance. However, R is
equal to the surface energy increase rate only for ideally brittle materials like glasses,
ceramics, rocks and ice, which obey the original Griffith criterion. Reformulated in the
manner suggested by Irwin (see also section 1.5) this criterion is:

         SV2a                                      (4.26)
    G = E > Gc = 2Je = R = a constant.

   In 1948 Irwin and Orowan independently pointed out that the Griffith theory could
be modified and applied to both brittle materials and metals that exhibit plastic defor-
mation. The modification recognised that R is equal to the sum of the surface energy, Je,
and the plastic strain work, Jp, accompanying crack extension. Consequently, equation
(4.26), being the condition for crack extension, was changed to

         SV2a                                      (4.27)
    G = E > Gc = 2(Je + Jp) = R .

For relatively ductile materials Jp >> Je, i.e. R is mainly plastic energy and the surface
energy can be neglected. Also, it is no longer certain that instability and fracture will
occur at a constant value of Gc since R need not be a constant. In fact R, and hence Gc,
are constant only for the condition of plane strain. In this case it is customary to write R
= GIc, in an analogous way to the plane strain fracture toughness KIc discussed in sec-
tion 3.6. Thus the plane strain criterion for crack extension, i.e. instability, is given by

    G = (1  Q2) SV2a E > GIc .                     (4.28)

As is shown in figure 4.9, this condition can be represented graphically in a plot of G
and R as a function of crack length. The left-hand side of inequality (4.28), G, corre-
sponds to a straight line with a slope depending on the applied stress V. Since the criti-
cal plane strain G value, GIc, is a constant, the crack resistance, R, is represented as a
horizontal line. Instability occurs if the combination of crack length and applied stress
gives rise to a G value that exceeds R.

   From equation (4.28) a critical stress, Vc, can be calculated for a certain crack length

    Vc =  EGIc                                     (4.29)
          2,
          (1  Q )Sa

or alternatively a critical crack length can be calculated for a certain applied stress:

ac = (1  Q2)SV2 .

It is clear from the foregoing relations that higher stresses result in instability at shorter
crack lengths or longer cracks result in instability at lower applied stresses.

4.6 Slow Stable Crack Growth and the R-Curve Concept

   As was mentioned in section 4.5, a constant value of R, i.e. R independent of the
crack length, is obtained only for the condition of plane strain. For plane stress and in-
termediate plane stress  plane strain conditions it turns out that R is no longer constant.
Loading a relatively thin (predominantly in plane stress) specimen containing a crack
results in the behaviour shown schematically in figure 4.10. The initial crack of length
ao begins to extend at a certain stress Vi. However, if the stress is maintained at Vi no
further crack growth occurs, indicating that a small increase in crack length at this stress
would result in G < R. However, a slight increase in the stress results in additional crack
extension, but the situation remains stable. The process of increasing stress accompa-
nied by stable crack growth continues until a critical combination of stress, Vc, and
crack length, ac, is reached, at which point instability occurs. Note that in the crack
length area between ao and ac G has to be equal to R, because otherwise crack arrest or
crack instability would occur.

   Instability is thus preceded by a certain amount of slow stable crack growth in
specimens under full or predominantly plane stress. In terms of the energy balance ap-
proach this situation can be described as in figure 4.11. The value of R is depicted as a
rising curve with a vertical segment corresponding to no crack extension at low stress
(and G) levels. At a stress Vi crack extension begins but R remains equal to G since the
situation is stable. This is indicated by the fact that G intersects the R-curve (then G =
R) but further crack growth cannot occur at Vi because GVi then becomes less than R.
98  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

 Figure 4.10. Slow stable crack growth in plane stress.

The stable condition (i.e. G = R) is maintained until Vc and ac are reached. Beyond this
point G becomes greater than R, as indicated by the GVc line, and instability occurs.

   Figure 4.11 shows that for instability to occur in plane stress it is not only necessary
to have at least a situation with G > R, but also the tangency condition wG/wa > wR/wa
should be fulfilled. This second condition is a consequence of assuming a rising R-
curve. This assumption has been verified experimentally, but there is no definitive ex-
planation as to why the R-curve rises: a possible explanation will be discussed in section
4.7. Meanwhile another important property of R-curves, their invariance with respect to
initial crack length ao, will be dealt with here.
R-Curve Invariance with Initial Crack Length
In Irwin's analysis R was considered to be independent of the total crack length a (= ao

+ 'a). This is true only for the plane strain condition, as illustrated in figure 4.9. If we
now consider the crack resistance for a thin sheet, it is reasonable to assume that the
very beginning of slow stable crack growth occurs in the middle of the specimen thick-
ness at a relatively low G value. Therefore, this growth will be under plane strain con-
ditions and will be independent of crack length. In addition, many tests have shown that
the form of the rising part of the R-curve is also independent of crack length. Thus we
may expect R-curves to be independent of the initial crack length ao, i.e. an invariant R-
curve may be placed anywhere along the horizontal axis of a (G,R)-crack length dia-
gram, as in figure 4.12.

 Figure 4.12. Invariant R-curves and the points of instability.

   Figure 4.12 shows, however, that a shift of the complete R-curve along the crack
length axis changes the point at which instability occurs, i.e. the tangency at which G =
R and wG/wa = wR/wa. Hence the point of instability will depend on the initial crack
length ao. In summary, an invariant R-curve has the following consequences:
1) Crack initiation is independent of initial crack length ao.
2) Instability depends on ao. A longer ao results in more stable crack growth and a

   higher G value at instability. In comparison with the plane strain situation it may
   thus be stated that instability definitely depends on total crack length a (= ao + 'a).

4.7 A Possible Explanation for the Rising R-Curve

   A working hypothesis of the rising R-curve has been given by Krafft, Sullivan and
Boyle (reference 5 of the bibliography). This hypothesis models the R-curve behaviour
under intermediate plane stress  plane strain conditions.

   Krafft et al. assume that in plane strain the plastic deformation energy necessary for
crack extension is related to the area of newly created crack surface, but in plane stress
the plastic energy is related to the volume contained by plane stress (45°) crack surfaces
100          Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

and their mirror images, as shown in figure 4.13. In this figure a specimen of thickness
B is considered to crack with a fraction S of the thickness in plane stress and the re-
maining fraction 1  S in plane strain. For a crack growth increment da the energy con-
sumption depends on the crack resistance R according to

     Bda R = dWS B(1  S)da + dWp B2S2 da ,                                               (4.31)
         dA        dV 2

       where dWS/dA = energy consumption per unit crack area (for plane strain)
               dWp/dV = energy consumption per unit volume of plastically deformed
                            material (for plane stress)

Therefore

     R = dWS (1  S) + dWp BS2 .                                                          (4.32)
     dA      dV 2

Experimentally it has been found that B·dWp/dV > > dWS/dA, so that from equation
(4.32) it is evident that as soon as shear lips (slant fracture) start to form the value of R
will show a sharp increase, i.e. R becomes approximately proportional to S2. In section
3.6 it was shown that monotonically loading to fracture generally results in a change
from flat to slant fracture. This being so, the generality of the rising R-curve is con-
firmed.

An Explanation for the Effect of Specimen Thickness on Fracture Toughness

The effect of specimen thickness on fracture toughness was mentioned in section 3.6
and illustrated by figure 3.13. The model of Krafft et al. provides an explanation of this
effect (for all but the thinnest specimens) in terms of the influence of specimen thick-
ness on Gc, which is related to the critical stress intensity for fracture via equation
(4.16), i.e. Kc = EcGc.

   Knott (reference 6 of the bibliography) made the assumption that the absolute thick-
ness of shear lips in a material is approximately constant, i.e. the fraction S in equation
(4.32) decreases with increasing specimen thickness. On this basis he analysed data of
Krafft et al. for the aluminium alloy 7075T6, assuming a constant shear lip thickness
4. The Energy Balance Approach                                                               101

of 2 mm. For a specimen 2 mm thick, i.e. S = 1, Gc had been found to be 200 kJ/m2. In
terms of equation (4.32) this means that

              R = Gc = dWp B dV 2 = 200 kJ/m2 .

On the other hand a value of 20 kJ/m2 was estimated for dWS/dA. Thus for this specific
alloy equation (4.32) could be reduced to

              Gc = 20(1  S) + 200S2 kJ/m2.

Figure 4.14 shows the result of using this equation as compared to experimental data for
the 7075-T6 alloy. The agreement is excellent and is strong evidence for the validity of
the model of Krafft et al.

    Note that a material giving shear lips was used both in the theory and example. However, many mate-
rials show no shear lips, but do have a rising R curve. For these materials the explanation can be the same
as mentioned above. When the crack grows, the plane stress plastic zone grows while the plane strain
zone decreases (compare with figure 3.9). Thus the crack resistance will increase during crack growth
since B·dWp/dV >> dWS/dA, cf. equation (4.32).

4.8 Crack Resistance: a Complete Description

   In sections 4.5  4.7 the concept of crack resistance, R, for more ductile materials has
been developed. It was indicated that under plane strain conditions fracture takes place
at a constant value of R and Gc = GIc, irrespective of the crack length. However, for
plane stress and intermediate plane stress  plane strain conditions a rising R-curve de-

102  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

velops and Gc is no longer constant but depends on the amount of crack extension. Fi-
nally it was shown that the R-curve behaviour can be fairly well explained by the model
of Krafft et al.

   At this point it is desirable to give a complete description of the R-curve concept, but
first it is necessary to discuss a change in notation. In the literature and in practice the R-
curve is no longer considered in terms of G and R. Instead the stress intensity factors KG
and KR are used. This is because the stress intensity factor concept has found wide-
spread application and the energy balance parameters G and R may be simply converted
to stress intensities via the relation KI = EcG.

   The reason for not adopting this notational conversion in previous sections of this
chapter is that the R-curve concept is based on energy balance principles and can be ex-
plained best in those terms. However, now it is convenient to describe the crack resis-
tance behaviour in terms compatible with current practice.

The R-Curve in Terms of Stress Intensity Factors

A schematic R-curve in terms of KG and KR is presented in figure 4.15.
In this diagram there are three important points:

1) Ki is the point of initial crack extension.
2) Kc is the critical stress intensity (instability point).
3) Kplat is the plateau level of the KR-curve. (Note that in figure 4.15 the plateau is be-

   yond instability.)

   Ki has been found by means of complicated experimental techniques to be independ-
ent of specimen thickness and to have a constant value for a particular material. The
reason for this behaviour may be that even in relatively thin specimens the initial crack
extension takes place in plane strain, as was assumed in section 4.6.

Figure 4.15. The R-curve in terms of stress intensity factor notation.
4. The Energy Balance Approach  103

   For Kc, however, there is a strong effect of specimen thickness: thinner specimens
give higher Kc values and consequently exhibit more slow stable crack growth, since Ki
remains constant. A possible explanation for this behaviour was given in section 4.7. It

should be noted that a sufficiently thick specimen will result in full plane strain and Kc
will then be equal to Ki.

   Kplat also depends strongly on specimen thickness. This parameter is not a generally
accepted feature of the KR-curve. A number of authors consider the existence of Kplat to
be due to specimen finite geometry effects and that the KR-curve for very wide panels
would attain a constant non-zero slope rather than a plateau level.

   Figure 4.16 shows an example of experimentally determined values of Ki, Kc and
Kplat as functions of specimen thickness. The data for Kplat (beyond instability) were
obtained by a special testing technique to be described in the next chapter, section 5.4.

 Figure 4.16. Experimental data for Ki, Kc and Kplat from reference 1 of the bibliography to this
                  chapter.

Effect of Specimen Thickness on KR-Curve Shape
From the observed dependence of Ki, Kc and Kplat on specimen thickness it is possible
to indicate the general shapes of KR-curves as functions of specimen thickness, figure
4.17. This figure demonstrates that a family of KR-curves can be presented and that the
curve for plane strain need not be considered as a separate case: it is simply a curve
which does not show stable crack growth. In this respect the plane strain KR-curve is
analogous to the original (G,R) representation of instability, figure 4.9, since it is to be
remembered that R-curves (and hence KR-curves) are independent of the initial crack
length, ao. This analogy is schematically depicted in figure 4.18.

Crack Resistance and KIc Testing
Although the procedure for KIc testing will be fully discussed in chapter 5, some re-

marks about the standard test method are appropriate here. This is because crack resis-
tance test results, like those in figure 4.16, shed some light on problems in determining
KIc.

   It has been remarked several times that there is a thickness effect on fracture tough-
ness, and that only above a certain specimen thickness more or less constant values (i.e.
KIc) are obtained. The minimum required thickness for KIc determination has been
found experimentally to be 2.5(KIc/Vys)2. This thickness is indicated as a line in figure
4.16. It is seen that although Ki is constant, Kc is still decreasing out to greater thickness.

   Note that the standard test method, described in some detail in the next chapter, de-
fines KIc as KI either after a `pop-in', which is a small amount of audible unstable crack

growth followed by crack arrest, or after 2% crack extension. From figure 4.16 it is
clear that Ki does not depend on specimen thickness, while Kc does: a 2% stable crack
extension can cause a significant increase in stress intensity. Now the question arises
whether this definition of KIc might lead to inconsistent results, especially for thick-
nesses near the minimum required thickness.

   Furthermore, assuming that the representation of KR-curves as in figure 4.17 is cor-
rect, then stable crack growth should have a small but consistent effect on the value of
KIc when specimens of widely differing initial crack length are used. This effect is dem-
onstrated schematically in figure 4.19 and has indeed been observed.

   It might be thought that the foregoing problems could readily be avoided by using Ki
instead of KIc, but as mentioned earlier Ki has to be found by means of complicated ex-
perimental techniques. This makes its determination unsuitable for a standard test.

LEFM Testing

5.1 Introduction
   In chapter 2 a number of analytical relationships were given for the determination of

stress intensity factors in elastic specimens with different crack geometries. These stress
intensity factors (KI, KII or KIII for the opening, edge-sliding or tearing modes of crack
extension, figure 2.1) are functions of load, crack size and specimen geometry.

   Ideally a critical stress intensity factor, Kc, can be used to predict the fracture behav-
iour in an actual structure. However, Kc depends on test temperature, specimen thick-
ness and constraint. A typical dependence is shown in figure 5.1. The form of this de-
pendence has been discussed in section 3.6 and reasonably well explained in section 4.7.

   Figure 5.1. Effect of thickness on Kc behaviour for a high strength maraging steel.

   Beyond a certain thickness, when the material is predominantly in plane strain and
under maximum constraint, the value of Kc tends to a constant lower limit, KIc, the
plane strain fracture toughness. KIc may be considered a material property, but does de-
pend on the test temperature and loading rate. After considerable study and experimen-
tal verification the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) published a
standard method for KIc testing (last revision is ASTM E 399-90). This method will be
described in section 5.2.

   Of more general interest is the establishment of a test methodology for Kc determi-
nation, since the operating temperatures, loading rates and thicknesses of most materials
used in actual structures are generally such that transitional plane strain-to-plane stress
or fully plane stress conditions exist in service. Several engineering approaches to the
problem of plane stress and transitional behaviour have been proposed. Only one, the
Feddersen method, has the versatility required for structural design. This approach is the
108  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

subject of section 5.3.
   Considerable effort bas been devoted towards R-curve testing and analysis. A "Ten-

tative Recommended Practice" for R-curve determination was issued by the ASTM in
1976 and this was followed by a standard in 1981 (last revision is ASTM E 561-94) .
The determination of R-curves is discussed in section 5.4.

   In section 5.5 a simple engineering approximation (Anderson's model) to account for
the effects of yield strength and specimen thickness on fracture toughness will be given.
Finally, in section 5.6 the practical use of Kc, KIc and R-curve data is summarised.

5.2 Plane Strain Fracture Toughness (KIc) Testing

   During the period in which fracture toughness testing developed (late 1950s and the
1960s) the most suitable analyses for characterizing the resistance to unstable crack
growth were those of LEFM. Although it was recognised that most structural materials
do not behave in a purely elastic manner on fracturing, it was hoped that provided crack
tip plasticity was very limited small specimens could be used to describe the situation of
unstable crack growth occurring in a large structure.

   Data like those in figure 5.1 showed that a fairly constant minimum value of Kc was
obtained under plane strain conditions, i.e. KIc. This value appeared to be a material
property. Thus it was decided to try and establish KIc values for various structural mate-
rials, in an analogous way to the establishment of mechanical properties like yield stress
and ultimate tensile strength.

   Under the supervision of the ASTM E-24 Fracture Committee numerous specimen
designs and test methods for KIc determination were considered. During the 1960s vari-
ous parameters, e.g. notch acuity, plate thickness, fracture appearance and stress levels
during fatigue precracking were investigated and resulted in the development of a stan-
dardized, plane strain KIc test method using either of two standard specimens, namely
the single edge notched bend (SENB or SE(B) in the last revision) and compact tension
(CT or C(T) in the last revision) specimens. Later also the Arc-shaped Tension, Disc-
shaped Compact and the Arc-shaped Bend specimens were introduced. The method was
first published in 1970 and is listed in its latest (1990, ASTM E 399-90 under jurisdic-
tion of committee E-8 on Fatigue and Fracture) version as reference 1 of the bibliogra-
phy to this chapter.

The Standard KIc Specimens

The original recommended standard KIc specimens are illustrated in figures 5.2 and 5.3.
For the other specimens that are allowed the reader should consult reference 1. Round
robin test programmes have shown that the standard specimens enable KIc values to be
reproducible to within about 15% by different laboratories.

   The stress intensity factors for these standard specimens are as follows:

   Experiments have shown that it is impractical to obtain a reproducible sharp, narrow
machined notch that will simulate a natural crack well enough. Therefore the specimens
must be fatigue precracked. To ensure that cracking occurs correctly the specimens

110  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

contain starter notches. Several possibilities are listed in the ASTM standard, but the
most frequently used is a chevron notch, figure 5.4, owing to its good reproducibility of
symmetrical in-plane fatigue crack fronts.

   The chevron notch forces fatigue cracking to initiate at the centre of the specimen
thickness and thereby increases the probability of a symmetric crack front. After frac-
ture toughness testing the length of the fatigue precrack, a, at positions a1, a2, a3 and at
the side surfaces is measured. For the value of a the mean of a1, a2 and a3 is used. As-
suming that other test requirements have been met the test is considered a valid KIc re-
sult if the difference between any two of the three crack length measurements does not
exceed 10% of the average and if the surface crack lengths as are within 10% of a.

   Figure 5.4. Chevron notch crack starter.

Specimen Size Requirement
The accuracy with which KIc describes the fracture behaviour depends on how well the
stress intensity factor characterizes the conditions of stress and strain immediately ahead
of the tip of the fatigue precrack, since it is here that unstable crack extension would
originate. In establishing the specimen size requirements for KIc tests the specimen di-
mensions must be large enough compared with the plastic zone size, ry. This ensures an
overall elastic behaviour of the specimen, so the stress intensity approach is still appro-
priate. Furthermore a predominantly plane strain state will be present at the crack tip.
The relevant dimensions (see figures 5.2 and 5.3) are:
1) The crack length, a.
2) The specimen thickness, B.
3) The remaining uncracked ligament length, W  a.

   After considerable experimental work the following minimum specimen size re-
quirements were established:

where Vys is the yield strength. Note that, since for the test specimens
0.45 < a/W < 0.55, the size of the remaining ligament, W  a, will more or less satisfy
the same minimum value as given in equations (5.3).

   Now in chapter 3 (section 3.5) it was stated that there are empirical rules for esti-
mating whether a specimen will be mainly in plane strain or plane stress: predominantly
plane strain behaviour may be expected when the calculated size of the plane stress
plastic zone, i.e. the diameter 2ry in Irwin's analysis, is no larger than one-tenth of the
specimen thickness. According to Irwin, for plane stress

     2S ©Vys¹

For KI = KIc the substitution of equation (5.4) in equation (5.3) shows that the minimum
thickness, B, is only about 8 times the plane stress plastic zone size, 2ry. The empirical
rule is therefore slightly conservative (a factor 10 instead of 8).

   It is important to note that the specification of a, B and W (and all the other specimen
dimensions) requires that the KIc value to be obtained must already be known or at least
estimated. There are three general ways of sizing test specimens before the required KIc
is actually obtained:

1) Overestimate KIc on the basis of experience with similar materials and empirical cor-
   relation with other types of notch toughness test, for example the Charpy impact test.

2) Use specimens that have as large a thickness as possible.
3) For high strength materials the ratio of (Vys/E) can be used according to the follow-

   ing table, which was drawn up by the ASTM.

KIc Test Procedure

The steps involved in setting up and conducting a KIc test are:

1) Determine the critical dimensions of the specimen (a, B, W).
2) Select a specimen type (notch bend or compact tension) and prepare shop drawings,

   e.g. specifying a chevron notch crack starter, figure 5.4.
3) Specimen manufacture.
4) Fatigue precracking.
5) Obtain test fixtures and clip gauge for crack opening displacement measurement.
6) Testing.
7) Analysis of load-displacement records.
8) Calculation of conditional KIc (KQ).
9) Final check for KIc validity.

   At least three replicate tests should be done for every material. Steps 1  3 will not
be discussed further. Steps 4  6 will now be concisely reviewed, since full details may
be found in reference 1 of the bibliography. The last three steps 7  9 are considered un-
der the next subheadings in this section.

   The purpose of notching and fatigue precracking the test specimen is to simulate an
ideal plane crack with essentially zero tip radius to agree with the assumptions made in
stress intensity analyses. There are several requirements pertaining to fatigue loading.
The most important is that the maximum stress intensity Kmax during the final stage of
fatigue cycling shall not exceed 60% of the subsequently determined KQ if this is to
qualify as a valid KIc result.

   Recommended test fixtures for notch bend and compact tension specimen testing are
described in the ASTM standard. These fixtures were developed to minimise friction
and have been used successfully by many laboratories. Other fixtures may be used pro-
vided good alignment is maintained and frictional errors are minimised.

   An essential part of a KIc test is accurate measurement of the crack mouth opening
displacement (CMOD) as a function of applied load. The displacement is measured with
a so-called clip gauge which is seated on integral or attachable knife edges on the
specimen, as shown in figure 5.5. Electrical resistance strain gauges are bonded to the
clip gauge arms and are connected up to form a Wheatstone Bridge circuit, as indicated.

   In carrying out the test there are requirements for specimen alignment in the test fix-
tures, the loading rate, test records and post-test measurements on the specimen. The
loading rate should be such that the rate of increase of stress intensity is within the range
0.55  2.75 MPa m/s. This is arbitrarily defined as `static' loading. It should be noted
that the ASTM standard does allow higher rates to be used. In this case the test time
should be at least 1 millisecond and the test record should meet additional requirements
concerning linearity.

   Each test record consists of a plot of the output of a load-sensing transducer versus
the clip gauge output. It is conventional to plot load along the y-axis, displacement
along the x-axis. The record is continued until the specimen is no longer able to sustain
a further increase in load. The maximum load must be determinable with an accuracy of

±1%. Post-test measurements of the specimen dimensions, B, W, S, and fatigue precrack
lengths a1, a2, a3, as (see figures 5.2  5.4) must be made to calculate KQ and check its
qualification as a valid KIc.
Analysis of Load-Displacement Records and Determination of Conditional KIc (KQ)
Plots of load versus displacement may have different shapes. The principal types of dia-
gram obtained are shown schematically in figure 5.6. Initially the displacement in-

creases linearly with load, P. In many cases there is either a gradually increasing non-
linearity, figure 5.6.a, or sudden crack extension and arrest (called `pop-in') followed by
nonlinearity, figure 5.6.b. Nonlinearity is caused by plastic deformation and stable crack
growth before fast fracture. If a material behaves almost perfectly elastically (as is
rarely the case) a diagram like that in figure 5.6.c is obtained.

   As shown in figure 5.6, the general types of P-V curves exhibit different degrees of
nonlinearity. Various criteria to establish the load corresponding to KIc have been con-
sidered. After considerable experimentation a 5% secant offset was chosen to define KIc
as the stress intensity factor at which the crack reaches an effective length about 2%
greater than at the beginning of the test. Although this definition is apparently arbitrary,
it turns out that for the standard SENB and CT specimens the effects of plasticity and
stable crack growth are more or less accounted for by assuming an effective length in-
crease of 2%. (Note, however, that some more detailed remarks about the effect of sta-
ble crack growth on KIc were made in section 4.8.)

   To establish whether a valid KIc can be obtained from the test it is first necessary to
calculate a candidate value, KQ. In order to determine the load, PQ, corresponding to
this candidate value a secant line is drawn from the origin O, with a slope 0.95 of that of
the tangent OA to the (initial) linear part of the test record. The load PS is the load at the
intersection of the secant line with the test record, figure 5.7.

   PQ is then defined according to the following procedure. If the load at every point on
the P-displacement record which precedes PS is lower than PS, then PQ is PS (Type I,
figure 5.7). However, if there is a maximum load preceding PS that is larger than PS,
then this maximum load is PQ (Types II and III, figure 5.7). In order to prevent accep-
tance of a test record for a specimen in which excessive stable crack growth occurred or
in which the stress state is not sufficiently plane strain, it is required at this stage of the
analysis that Pmax/PQ be less than 1.10. The value of this ratio is based on experience.

Figure 5.7. Types of load-displacement curves illustrating determination of PS and PQ.
5. LEFM Testing                                           115

Check for KIc validity

   After determining PQ the value of KQ is calculated using the appropriate stress inten-
sity factor expression, i.e. equations (5.1) or (5.2) for the SENB or CT specimens re-
spectively. Then it is determined whether this KQ is consistent with the specimen size
and material yield strength according to equations (5.3), i.e. the quantity 2.5 (KQ/Vys)2
must be less than the thickness, B, and the crack length, a, of the specimen. Finally, a
check is made whether the crack front symmetry requirements mentioned in the discus-
sion to figure 5.4 are met.

   If these requirements are not all met the test must be declared invalid and the result
may be used only to estimate the fracture toughness: it is not an ASTM standard value.

5.3 Plane Stress Fracture Toughness (Kc) Testing: the Feddersen
       Approach

   There is no standard method of plane stress fracture toughness (Kc) testing. In what
follows, the engineering approach of Feddersen, which is a good method suited to prac-
tical use besides R-curve testing, will be described. The original description is given in
reference 2 of the bibliography to this chapter.

   Consider a thin plate under plane stress with a central crack 2ao loaded in tension,
figure 5.8. On reaching a stress Vi the crack will begin to extend by slow stable crack
growth. In order to maintain crack growth the stress has to be increased further: the
crack will stop growing if the load is kept constant.

   Slow crack growth continues until a critical crack size 2ac is reached at a stress Vc.

Figure 5.8. Residual strength behaviour in plane stress.
116  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

Then the crack becomes unstable and fracture occurs. If the initial crack is longer, for
example 4ao, stable crack growth starts at a lower stress, the amount of slow crack
growth is larger, but Vc is lower.

   If it is assumed that all events in crack propagation and fracture are governed by the
stress intensity factor, particular stress intensity factors can be attributed to each event
as follows:

                      §a·
     Ki = Vi Sao f ¨W¸

                      ©¹

     §a·
     Kc = Vc Sac f ¨W¸                      (5.5)
     ©¹

                       §a·
     Ke = Vc Sao f ¨W¸ ,

                       ©¹

where Ki is the critical stress intensity for the onset of (stable) crack growth and Kc is
the critical stress intensity for fracture. Ke is an apparent stress intensity, since it relates
the initial crack size to the fracture stress: it has an engineering significance because ir-
respective of whether slow stable crack growth subsequently occurs the value of Ke de-
fines the residual strength of a plate containing a crack of a given initial size.

    Instead of using actual crack sizes, a, in equations (5.5) the effective crack sizes a + ry could be used,
as in Irwin's analysis in section 3.2. However, this is not necessary in the Feddersen approach, since in
calculating stress intensity factors to obtain the residual strength diagram and the reverse operation of us-
ing the diagram to calculate the fracture stress or initial crack size the contribution of ry cancels out.

   Tests have shown that Ki, Kc and Ke are not material constants with general validity
like KIc. However, they are approximately constant for a given thickness and a limited
range of crack length-to-specimen width ratio, a/W. For a given material with an appar-

          5. LEFM Testing                                           117

ent toughness, Ke, the relation between the residual strength and initial crack size of a
(large) centre cracked panel is given ideally by the curve Vc = Ke/ Sao, as shown in
figure 5.9.

   However, for small crack sizes Vc tends to infinity, but the residual strength at ao = 0
cannot be larger than the yield stress. On the other hand, as 2ao tends towards W, the re-
sidual strength approaches zero. At these two extremes net section yield occurs. Fedder-

sen proposed the construction of two tangents to the curve (this was also based on ex-
perimental results), one from the stress axis at Vys and the other from the crack length
axis at W. In the region between the points of tangency Ke is approximately constant:
this part of the curve plus the two tangents constitute the residual strength diagram.

   Now a tangent to the Ke curve at any point is

dV  d § Ke · V
d(2ao) = d(2ao) ¨ Sa ¸ =  4ao .                                     (5.6)
    © o¹

For the tangent from (0,Vys) equation (5.6) gives, see figure 5.9,

 Vc1 4ao1 =  Vys  Vc1 2ao1 , or Vc1 = 2Vys 3                        (5.7)

and so the left-hand tangency point is always at 2Vys/3.
   Also from figure 5.9, the tangent from (W,0) is defined by

 Vc2 4ao2 =  Vc2 W  2ao2 , or 2ao2 = W3 .                           (5.8)

Thus the right-hand tangency point is always at W/3.

Figure 5.11. Residual strength for various panel widths.

   The same construction can be made for Ki and Kc, see figure 5.10. Summarising, the
screening criteria for valid plane stress fracture toughness testing are

                    2Vys                                     (5.9)

and

                     W
              2ax < 3 ,

where Vx stands for Vi or Vc and 2ax stands for 2ao or 2ac, depending on whether Ki, Kc
or Ke is considered, cf. equations (5.5).

   It has been found that the Feddersen approach represents experimental data quite
well. This being so, the approach is useful because the complete residual strength dia-
gram can be constructed for any panel size if Vys and either Ki, Ke or Kc are known.
Furthermore, one can easily determine the minimum panel size for valid plane stress
fracture toughness testing. Consider the construction for Ke as a function of panel width,
figure 5.11.

   The minimum panel size for valid Ke determination is where the two tangency points
coincide. W1 and W2 are sufficient, but W3 is too narrow because the failure stress lies
along the line joining (0,Vys) to (W3 ,0) and is given by

                §W3  2ao3·                                   (5.10)

i.e. failure always occurs at net section yield in the case of W3: it is no longer a fracture
mechanics problem, but a yielding dominant problem.

   From Ke = V Sao the left-hand point of tangency is given by
                     5. LEFM Testing                                           119

                              2S ©Vys¹

The two tangency points coincide when Wmin/3 = 2ao. Thus from equation (5.11)

         27 § Ke ·2                                                            (5.12)
Wmin = ¨ ¸ .

         2S ©Vys¹

Similarly, the value of Wmin can be found for Ki or for Kc.
   Note that equation (5.12) cannot be used as a screening criterion. This is because

violation of one of the criteria of equation (5.9) would lead to a lower apparent K value
(on a tangent rather than the residual strength curve) and substitution of this K value in
equation (5.11) would give too small a value of Wmin, i.e. an invalid test could be de-
clared valid.

Some Experimental Considerations for Kc Testing

Actual test conditions for Kc determination are not rigorously defined as in standard
tests. However, there are a number of guidelines and remarks:

1) It is obvious from what has previously been discussed that Kc tests should be con-
   ducted for material thicknesses representative of actual applications.

2) The tests should preferably be done with centre cracked panels, for which the stress
   intensity factors are well defined and the problems of secondary bending and buck-
   ling are minimised (but see point 5 below).

3) Fatigue precracking is advisable, but not necessary if the notch is sharp enough to
   start slow crack growth well before fracture.

4) The maximum load in the test should be taken as the fracture load. Only if Kc is to be
   determined should slow crack growth be measured, and then a load-time record syn-
   chronised with the crack growth record must be made.

5) Under the subheading "Edge Notched Specimens" in section 2.4 it was argued that
   compressive stresses Vx = V are present along the flanks of a central crack in a uni-
   axially loaded plate. Especially in thin sheets these compressive stresses can cause
   local buckling near the crack, and for long cracks buckling occurs well before the
   specimen is ready to fail and may significantly affect the residual strength. If such
   buckling would be restrained in service (by structural reinforcements) then anti-
   buckling guides must be used in the specimen test. On the other hand, anti-buckling
   guides should not be used to prevent buckling that could occur in service.

6) In figure 5.9 the ideal fracture mechanics curve (Vc = Ke/ Sao) is shown dotted. This
   formula is valid only for a large plate with a small crack, i.e. the right-hand part of
   the curve where 2a o W is incorrect. Instead the f(a/W) corrections given in sections
   (2.4) or (2.8) should be used.

5.4 The Determination of R-Curves

   A limitation of Kc testing is that the effect of slow stable crack growth is not properly
characterized. If we restrict ourselves to the apparent fracture toughness Ke this is not a
problem, because then only the initial crack length is used. However if the Kc value is
needed, it is obtainable from R-curves, as has been discussed in sections 4.6  4.8.

   An R-curve is a plot of crack-extension resistance as a function of stable crack exten-
sion, 'a. The crack growth resistance may be expressed in the same units as G or, as is
now customary, in terms of stress intensity factors, i.e. KG = EcG, KR = EcR.

   R-curves can be determined by either of two experimental techniques: load control or
displacement control. The crack grows owing to increments of increased load or dis-
placement. The load control method involves rising load tests with crack driving force
(KG) curves like those shown in figure 5.12. Under rising load conditions (P1 < P2 < P3
< P4) the crack extends gradually to a maximum of 'a, where unstable crack growth
occurs at KG = Kc. This point is determined as the tangency point between the KR-curve
and one of the lines representing a crack driving force curve, KG = f(P, a,a/W), in this
case the KG-curve corresponding to load P4. During the slow stable fracturing, the de-
veloping crack growth resistance KR is equal to the applied KG. Clearly, this testing
method is capable only of obtaining that portion of the R-curve up to KR = Kc, when in-
stability occurs.

   Under displacement control a suitable specimen results in negatively sloped crack
driving force curves, as shown in figure 5.13.

    In order to understand the conditions for which the slope of the crack driving force becomes negative
it is convenient to consider KI as a function of displacement, V, and crack length, a, i.e. KI = KI(V,a). We
can write

              dKI = §wKI· + §wKI· dV .
              da © wa ¹V © wV ¹a da

The derivative (wKI/wV)a is always positive, while dV/da is either zero (fixed grip) or positive (constant

load). A negatively sloped crack driving force curve, i.e. dKI/da < 0, can be obtained by using fixed grip
conditions and a specimen configuration such that (wKI/wa)V is negative. Specimen configurations of this
kind are widely available and will be discussed later on in the present section. In fact the only case for
which a fixed grip condition does not ensure a negative dKI/da is a remotely loaded centre cracked plate.
It should be noted that even under constant load conditions dKI/da can be negative, albeit for a limited
number of specimen configurations. One example is the crack-line loading case for a central crack men-
tioned in section 2.5.

   Under displacement control the specimen can be loaded by a wedge, which must be
progressively further inserted in order to obtain greater displacements (V1 < V2 < V3) and
further crack growth. For each displacement the crack arrests when the crack driving
force curve intersects the R-curve. Because there can be no tangency to the developing
crack growth resistance, KR, the crack tends to remain stable up to a plateau level, i.e.
the entire R-curve can be obtained.

Relation Between R-Curve and Kc Testing

In section 4.6 it was indicated that R-curves are invariant, i.e. independent of initial
crack length, ao. However, Kc is approximately constant for only a limited range of
crack lengths. The relation between R-curve and Kc testing is summarised schematically
in figure 5.14. The shape of the Kc-ao curve in figure 5.14.b is due to two effects which
partly oppose each other. First, moving the R-curve along the a axis tends to raise the
(G,R) and hence (KG,KR) tangency points. Second, the KG line becomes markedly
curved for longer initial crack lengths, figure 5.14.a, owing to the influence of finite
specimen width on the stress intensity factor, as discussed in section 2.4. Increasing
curvature of the KG lines tends to lower the (KG,KR) tangency points.

   For given test and material conditions a Kc value (obtained by rising load testing)
represents only a single point on an R-curve. But since R-curves are invariant, with the
R-curve approach the complete variation of Kc with changes in initial crack length can
be described. Thus an R-curve is equivalent to a large number of direct Kc tests con-
ducted with various initial crack lengths. In practice, however, this is not too important
in view of the success of the Feddersen approach, i.e. the tangency constructions to ob-
tain the complete residual strength diagram. It is only when the estimation of the

amount of stable crack growth is important that R-curve testing must be done.

Recommended Specimens for R-Curve Testing
In 1976 the ASTM published a recommended practice for R-curve determination, fol-
lowed in 1981 by a standard (the last revision of the standard was made in 1994: ASTM
E 561-94, reference 3 of the bibliography). The ASTM method will be concisely dis-
cussed in what follows. In general the specimens will have a thickness representative of
plates considered for actual service. The ASTM recommends three types of specimens:
1) The centre cracked tension specimen (CCT or also called M(T), the middle-cracked

   tension specimen in the last revision of the standard).
2) The compact specimen (CS or C(T) in the last revision). These are the same as com-

   pact tension specimens (CT) used for KIc testing except that they may be of any
   thickness.
3) The crack-line wedge-loaded specimen (CLWL or C(W) in the last revision).
   The first two types of specimen are tested under load control (rising KG curves),
while the CLWL specimen may be used for displacement control tests. The specimens
5. LEFM Testing                                                123

are illustrated in figures 5.15  5.17. In figure 5.17 V1 and V2 refer to locations at which
displacements are measured in order to determine compliance and hence effective crack
length. The same locations can be used for the CS specimen.

Figure 5.17. Crack-line wedge-loaded specimen (CLWL or C(W)).
124  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

   The specimens must be fatigue precracked unless it can be shown that the machined
notch root radius effectively simulates the sharpness of a fatigue precrack. For the CCT
specimen the machined notch must be 30  35% of W with fatigue cracks not less than
1.3 mm in length. For the CS and CLWL specimens the starter notch configuration is
basically similar to that required for KIc testing, but owing to the lesser thickness a
chevron notch crack starter (figure 5.4) may not be necessary to obtain a symmetrical
crack front, i.e. a straight through electric discharge machined (EDM) slot will often
suffice. The initial crack length must be between 35  45% of W.

Specimen Size

Specimen size is based solely on the requirement that the uncracked ligaments (W  2a)
or (W  a) must be predominantly elastic at all values of applied load. More precisely,
for the CCT specimen the net section stress based on the effective crack size (which is
the physical crack size augmented for the effects of crack-tip plastic deformation, 2(ao +
'a + ry)) must be less than the yield stress. The radius ry of the plastic zone is given by
Irwin's analysis in section 3.2. Addition of ry to the physical crack size is necessary be-
cause under plane stress conditions the plastic zone size is relatively large and has a sig-
nificant effect on the specimen stiffness. For the CS and CLWL specimens the condition
that the uncracked ligaments must be predominantly elastic is given by the more or less
empirical relation

                              4 §Kmax·2  (5.13)
     W  (ao + 'a + ry) t ¨ ¸ ,

                              S © Vys ¹

where Kmax is the maximum stress intensity level in the test. Equation (5.13) amounts to
the requirement that the remaining uncracked ligament be at least equal to 8ry max.

   It is worth noting here that incorporation of a plastic zone size correction will result
in Kc values consistently slightly higher than those obtained by the Feddersen approach
(although there is no fundamental objection to using a plastic zone size correction for
the latter, see section 5.3).

R-Curve Test Procedure

Broadly speaking, the procedure in R-curve testing is similar to steps 1  7 for KIc test-
ing, section 5.2. However, for R-curve testing the initial step is choice of testing tech-
nique (load control or displacement control) and specimen type. The advantage of the
displacement control technique in enabling determination of the entire R-curve is
somewhat offset by the more complicated test machine operation. However, most labo-
ratories are nowadays equipped with computer-controlled test machines and more or
less standard software packages.

   Additional experimental requirements are that the effective crack length must be de-
termined and buckling prevented. The physical crack length can be measured using e.g.
optical microscopy or the electrical potential method, and subsequently the measured
crack length can be adjusted by the addition of ry. Alternatively, the effective crack

length can be determined directly by means of compliance measurements: the procedure
for this is fully described in the ASTM standard practice. Use of compliance instru-
mentation also makes it possible to determine whether the specimen develops undesir-
able buckling despite the presence of anti-buckling guides.

   All types of specimen must be loaded incrementally, allowing time between steps for
the crack to stabilise before measuring load and crack length, except if autographic in-
strumentation is used. In the latter case the load versus crack extension can be moni-
tored continuously, but the loading rate must be slow enough not to introduce strain rate
effects into the R-curve. To develop an R-curve the load versus crack extension data (ao
+ 'a + ry) can be used to calculate the crack driving force KG, and hence KR, using one
of the two following expressions for the stress intensity factor:

the ASTM standard practice.

5.5 An Engineering Approximation to Account for the Effects of Yield
       Strength and Specimen Thickness on Fracture Toughness:
       Anderson's Model

   Figure 5.1. shows that the value of Kc depends on thickness, decreasing gradually to
a limiting lower value of KIc. The effect of sheet thickness is related to the gradual tran-
sition from plane stress to plane strain, and this transition is strongly influenced by the
yield strength, as shown schematically in figure 5.18. A higher yield strength signifies a
smaller plastic zone, so that there is more material in plane strain and the fracture
toughness in the transition region is lower. It is also found that Kc and KIc generally de-
crease with increasing yield strength.
126          Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

 Figure 5.18. Schematic of the effects of yield strength and specimen thickness on Kc.

   Although the qualitative trend shown in figure 5.18 is well established, there is no
generally accepted quantitative model of the thickness effect. The simplest and also the
most readily usable model is that of Anderson, figure 5.19.

Figure 5.19. The thickness effect according to Anderson (reference 4 of the bibliography to this
                chapter).

   The model is empirical. With knowledge of the two `basic' fracture toughness values
Kc,max and KIc a line is drawn between the points A and C, which can be obtained from
the following empirical relations:

1) Point A is given by

     1 §Kc,max·2
     B1 = ¨    ¸.                               (5.17)
     3S © Vys ¹

2) Point C is obtained from the limit of the ASTM condition for nominal plane strain
   behaviour (see section 5.2), i.e.
                  5. LEFM Testing                                                  127

   The simplicity of Anderson's model makes it useful in an engineering sense, i.e. es-
timating fracture toughness for a practical sheet thickness when a full range of data are
not available.

5.6 Practical Use of KIc, Kc and R-Curve Data

   KIc data can be useful in two general ways. First, they may be used directly for
choosing between materials for a particular application, especially high strength aero-
space materials. More generally, since it is desirable (if possible) to avoid plane
strain/low energy fracture, KIc values may be used as a basis for a screening criterion to
ensure plane stress/high energy fracture. Several criteria have been proposed. One of the
simplest is the through-thickness yielding criterion

KIc t Vys B ,                                                                      (5.19)

which gives the desired increase in toughness with increasing yield strength and sheet

thickness in order to obtain plane stress fracture. This criterion is useful when Vys and
KIc of a material are known. In this case the thickness B has to be less than or equal to
(KIc/Vys)2 in order to avoid low energy fracture. A full derivation of this criterion is
given in reference 5 of the bibliography.

   Use of the through-thickness yield criterion can be demonstrated with the help of

Figure 5.20. Illustration of the use of the through-thickness yielding criterion.
128  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics

figure 5.20, which shows KIc  Vys data for various materials, together with lines corre-
sponding to different ratios of KIc/Vys. From equation (5.19) it is seen that these ratio
lines have the dimension LENGTH. Thus each line may be considered to correspond to
a particular sheet thickness, B, as indicated in the table in figure 5.20.

   The lines give minimum values of KIc/Vys necessary for through-thickness yielding
to occur in a sheet of given thickness, e.g. for a sheet 3 mm thick the minimum value of
KIc/Vys is 0.055. Comparison of actual KIc  Vys data with the ratio lines in figure 5.20
shows the following.

1) The titanium alloy beta C has high strength but low toughness. However, the alloy
   can still meet the through-thickness yielding criterion, equation (5.19), for sheet
   thicknesses up to 3 mm.

2) 7475 aluminium alloy and Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy meet the through-thickness
   yielding criterion for sheet thicknesses up to at least 12.7 mm.

3) 10 Ni steel combines high toughness with high strength and meets the through-
   thickness yielding criterion for heavy sections approaching 50 mm thickness.

Clearly, if it is required to meet the through-thickness yielding criterion in practice, then
10 Ni steel would be selected for heavy sections. On the other hand it would be possible
to use beta C titanium alloy in thin sheet applications, thereby taking advantage of the
lower density of titanium as compared to steel. Also, it should be noted that other mate-
rials can be plotted on diagrams like figure 5.20, and that actual selection of materials
has to take into account many other factors, some or most of which are unrelated to
fracture mechanics considerations.

   Intermediate plane stress  plane strain and fully plane stress fracture toughness data
are primarily of interest for determining the residual strengths of actual structures using
materials of the same thickness. Here again the materials may be compared, as in the
introductory example given in chapter 1, section 1.8. For the majority of situations
where LEFM can be applied there is little incentive to use R-curves instead of the rela-
tively straightforward engineering approach of Feddersen. Only when the characteriza-
tion of slow stable crack growth is important will R-curve data be required, for example
in thin sheet stiffened structures like aircraft fuselages, reference 6 of the bibliography.

   At this point in the course we come to the end of Part II, which has been concerned
with LEFM. It is appropriate to note that the inability to account properly for plasticity
is often a major limitation. Many engineering materials combine high toughness with
low yield strength, so that the required thickness for a valid KIc test may reach the order
of magnitude of a metre! Obviously, KIc tests on such materials are neither practical nor
useful, if only because the materials would never be used in such thicknesses (see also
section 7.5). Also, excessive plasticity in these materials will rule out Kc testing of
plates with thicknesses representative for actual structures. Resort has then to be made
to Elastic Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM) characterization of the crack resistance or
to a plastic collapse analysis. The subject of EPFM is treated in chapters 6  8, which
comprise Part III of the course. Since it is not a fracture-dominant failure mode (see also
section 1.2), plastic collapse will only be mentioned shortly in chapter 6. In chapter 8
5. LEFM Testing                                                                       129

some attention is paid to failure due to the combination of fracture and plasticity.

Basic Aspects of
Elastic-Plastic
Fracture Mechanics

6.1 Introduction
   Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) was originally developed to describe

crack growth and fracture under essentially elastic conditions, as the name implies. In
this case plasticity is confined to a very small region surrounding the crack tip. How-
ever, such conditions are met only for plane strain fracture of high strength metallic
materials and for fracture of intrinsically brittle materials like glasses, ceramics, rocks
and ice.

   Later it was shown that LEFM concepts could be slightly altered in order to cope
with limited plasticity in the crack tip region. In this category falls the treatment of
fracture problems in plane stress, e.g. the R-curve concept discussed in chapter 4. Nev-

   Figure 6.1. Ranges of applicability of LEFM and EPFM for describing fracture behaviour.
134  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

ertheless, there are many important classes of materials that are too ductile to permit de-
scription of their behaviour by LEFM: the crack tip plastic zone is simply too large. For
these cases other methods must be found.

   In this part of the course we shall discuss methods in the category of Elastic-Plastic
Fracture Mechanics (EPFM). These methods significantly extend the description of
fracture behaviour beyond the elastic regime, but they too are limited. Thus EPFM can-
not treat the occurrence of general yield leading to so-called plastic collapse. Figure 6.1
gives a schematic indication of the ranges of applicability of LEFM and EPFM in the
various regimes of fracture behaviour.

   Since this course concerns fracture mechanics concepts, no further attention will be
paid to plastic collapse, which is a yielding-dominant failure mode (see section 1.2).
Discussion is confined to cases A, B, C and sometimes D of figure 6.1, i.e. the fracture-
dominant failure modes. The LEFM concepts applicable to cases A and B have been
treated in the previous chapters 2  5. Here and in chapters 7 and 8 the principles of
EPFM, which are applicable to cases B, C and D, will be given.

   Note that the ranges of applicability of LEFM and EPFM overlap in figure 6.1. Be-
fore proceeding to the development of EPFM it is worthwhile to discuss these ranges of
applicability in some more detail. This will be done with the help of figure 6.2.

   Figure 6.2.a gives a schematic residual strength diagram for a relatively brittle mate-
rial in terms of the dimensionless crack length, 2a/W (W = panel width), of a centre
cracked panel. Except for very short cracks the residual strength is determined by the
stress intensity factor, since the Kc curve lies well below the line representing net sec-
tion yield (and hence plasticity induced failure) of the uncracked ligaments. Thus LEFM
is applicable for most cases. However, for very short cracks the plastic zone size is no
longer relatively small, and EPFM concepts will have to be used.

Figure 6.2. Schematic residual strength diagrams for (a) relatively brittle and (b) relatively
               ductile materials.
6. Basic Aspects of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics  135

   Figure 6.2.b gives a residual strength diagram for a relatively ductile material.
Clearly the unconstrained yield stress, Vys, will be reached in the uncracked ligaments
well before the critical stress Vc = Kc/ Sac because the critical stress intensity factor,
Kc, is high in ductile materials. The fracture behaviour is therefore likely to be con-
trolled by general yielding, i.e. neither LEFM or EPFM are applicable. However, in
situations of high constraint, e.g. cracks in thick sections, the effective yield stress will
increase to CVys, where C is the plastic constraint factor discussed in section 3.5. The Kc
curve may then predict a failure stress, Vc, of the same order of magnitude as that given
by the net section yield line: this is shown for a fairly wide range of 2a/W in figure
6.2.b. In such situations EPFM can be used to predict fracture behaviour. LEFM cannot
be applied because Vc will be too large a fraction of the effective yield stress and the
plastic zone size will be too large.

   It might be thought that situations of high constraint are rather special cases. In fact
they are of prime importance with respect to practical applications. In the power gener-
ating and chemical processing industries most cracks occur in high pressure parts,
which are of course thick-walled vessels and pipes. Also, the offshore industry has to
cope with cracks in very large thick-sectioned welded structures. Seen in this light it is
therefore not surprising that most contributions to the development of EPFM have come
from these industries. In contrast LEFM is principally applied in the aerospace industry,
where weight savings are at a premium and high strength, relatively brittle materials
must be used.

6.2 Development of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   Within the context of EPFM two general ways of trying to solve fracture problems
can be identified:

1) A search for characterizing parameters (cf. K, G, R in LEFM).
2) Attempts to describe the elastic-plastic deformation field in detail, in order to find a

   criterion for local failure.

It is now generally accepted that a proper description of elastic-plastic fracture behav-
iour, which usually involves stable crack growth, is not possible by means of a straight-
forward, single parameter concept. Numerous detailed studies are being made of local
failure criteria and elastic-plastic crack tip stress fields, but these are unlikely to give re-
sults suitable for practical use in the near future.

   So far a notable success of EPFM for practical applications, however, is the ability to
describe the initiation of crack growth and also a limited amount of actual growth using
one or two parameters. Of the concepts developed for this purpose two have found a
fairly general acceptance: the J integral and the Crack Opening Displacement (COD)
approaches. Besides these concepts a number of others exist, but none have received
widespread recognition.

   Since this course is intended to provide a basic knowledge of fracture mechanics the
discussion of EPFM concepts will be limited to the generally accepted J integral and
COD approaches, which are treated in sections 6.3  6.5 and in section 6.6 respectively.
136  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   In section 6.8 the relation between J and COD is discussed. This is of itself interest-
ing, but it is also helpful for illustrating the equivalence of J and G in the LEFM regime
and that J is compatible with LEFM principles.

6.3 The J Integral

   The J integral concept was first introduced by Rice, references 1 and 2 of the biblio-
graphy. Based on an energy approach Rice formulated J as a path-independent line inte-
gral with a value equal to the decrease in potential energy per increment of crack exten-
sion in linear or nonlinear elastic material. Its path independence implies that J can be
seen as a measure for the intensity of stresses and strains at the tips of notches and
cracks (see also section 6.5). Therefore the J integral can be viewed both as an energy
parameter, comparable to G, and as a stress intensity parameter comparable to K.

   In this section the energy description of J, i.e. as a nonlinear elastic energy release
rate, will be considered first. Then a derivation is given that expresses this energy re-
lease rate as a line integral and it will be shown that this integral is path independent.
Finally the usefulness of the J integral concept is discussed.

Energy Description of J

In section 4.2 the total energy of an elastic cracked plate and its loading system was
given as1

     U = Uo + Ua + UJ  F .               (4.1)

In chapter 4 we have considered only linear elastic behaviour. However, there is no rea-
son why equation (4.1) should not be valid for elastic material behaviour that is nonlin-
ear: the essence is that the behaviour is elastic. A load-displacement diagram for a non-
linear elastic body is shown schematically in figure 6.3.a.

   An important consequence of the extended validity of equation (4.1) is that under
certain restrictions nonlinear elastic behaviour can be used to model plastic behaviour of
a material. This is known as the deformation theory of plasticity. The main restriction is
that no unloading may occur in any part of a body since for actual plastic behaviour the
plastic part of the deformation is irreversible. The difference in unloading behaviour of
bodies made of nonlinear elastic or plastic material is illustrated by comparing figures
6.3.a and 6.3.b.

   In section 4.2 a part Up of the total energy U of a cracked plate and its loading sys-
tem was regarded as potential energy, i.e.

     Up = Uo + Ua  F                     (4.2)

The energy available in linear elastic material per unit of new crack area was derived
and designated as the energy release rate G. In equation (4.6) G was defined for a cen-

1 As before, we consider two-dimensional geometries only, and all loads and energies are defined per
   unit thickness.

tral crack. Here we will consider an edge crack and define a nonlinear elastic equivalent
accordingly:

dUp d
J =  da = da (F  Ua) .                                                  (6.1)

Equation (6.1) gives the energy definition of J. Note that for linear elastic material be-
haviour J = G by definition (see also remark 4 in section 6.8).

Concepts Necessary for Deriving J as a Line Integral

For the derivation of an expression for J as a line integral a two-dimensional situation is
assumed, i.e. there is no dependence of relevant quantities upon the thickness co-
ordinate. This simplifies the analysis but does have consequences for its generality, as
will be mentioned in section 6.4.

   To understand the derivation the reader should be familiar with the following:

· Index notation
   In this derivation it is more convenient to use an index notation instead of the engi-
   neering notation used until now. In the index notation the coordinate axes are no
   longer x, y and z, but xi with the index i ranging from 1 to 3. The components of an
   arbitrary vector V are Vi and the components of the stress and strain tensors are Vij and
   Hij.
   For the current two-dimensional analysis the indices take only the values 1 or 2. The
   matrix representations of stress and strain are

ª Vx Wxy º ª V11 V12 º«                        ª Hx Hxy º ª H11 H12 º»
            »«          »                     «  »«
[Vij] = «   »=«                » and [Hij] = «   »=«                ».
         ¬ Wyx Vy ¼ ¬ V21 V22 ¼               ¬ Hyx Hy ¼ ¬ H21 H22 ¼

As is customary with the index notation, the summation convention will be used, im-
plying a summation with respect to symbol indices that are the same for the compo-
138  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   nents of a term, see for example equation (6.2).
· Strain energy density

   For an elastic material a strain energy density W, i.e. an elastic strain energy per unit
   volume, can be defined. The infinitesimal strain energy density dW is the work per
   unit volume done by the stress Vij during an infinitesimal strain increment dHij. It is
   given by

     dW = V11 dH11 + V21 dH21 + V12 dH12 + V22 dH22 = Vij dHij .                   (6.2)

The strain energy density for a total strain Hkl is obtained by integration, i.e.

     Hkl  Hkl

     ³ ³ W = W(Hkl) = dW = Vij dHij .                                              (6.3)

     0    0

   This means that the strain energy density W can be calculated if the strain, Hkl, is
   known as well as the (linear or nonlinear) elastic relation between stress and strain,
   i.e. Vij as a function of Hij.
· Traction
   The traction vector T is a force per unit area acting on some plane in a stressed mate-
   rial. It can be expressed in terms of the stress tensor V according to:

        ªT1º ª V11 V12 º ªn1º ªV11n1 + V12n2º
        «» «                           »« » «                     »
     Ti = Vij nj  « » = «              »« »=«                     »,               (6.4)
        ¬T2¼ ¬ V21 V22 ¼ ¬n2¼ ¬V21n1 + V22n2¼

   where n1 and n2 are the components of the unit vector n normal to the plane on which
   T acts. Note that the dimension of T is force per unit area.
· Principle of virtual work
   When solving problems of elasticity it is often convenient to use the principle of
   virtual work (see reference 3 of the bibliography). In the case of a particle this prin-
   ciple states that if such a particle is in equilibrium, the total work of all real forces
   acting on the particle in any virtual displacement vanishes. For a deformable body
   we have to deal with internal stresses and strains too. The principle now states that
   the body is in a state of equilibrium if for any virtual displacement field the total
   virtual work done by all real external forces is equal to the total virtual work done by
   all real internal stresses, i.e.

              total external virtual work = total internal virtual work.

   Equilibrium in a two-dimensional body, or even part of a body, can therefore also be
   expressed in terms of the virtual work equation
   6. Basic Aspects of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics  139

³ ³ Ti GUi ds = Vij GHij dA ,                              (6.5)

*      A

        where *, A = perimeter and area of the two-dimensional body respectively,
                  ds = increment along perimeter *,
                   Ti = traction acting on perimeter,
                  GUi = any suitable virtual displacement field,
                 GHij = virtual strain field corresponding to GUi.

A suitable virtual displacement field is any field of small displacements that is kine-
matically admissible, i.e. it must be (i) differentiable and (ii) compatible with im-
posed conditions at the surface of the body. Virtual strain is related to virtual dis-
placement according to

   §w     w·
GHij = ½ ¨ GUi + GUj¸ .                                    (6.6)

For an elastic material, i.e. stress and strain are uniquely related, the virtual work
equation can also be written in terms of the virtual strain energy density GW = Vij GHij:

³ ³ Ti GUi ds = GW dA .                                    (6.7)

Potential Energy of an Elastic Body and its Loading System

Consider the two-dimensional cracked body consisting of nonlinear elastic material
shown in figure 6.4. The body has a surface A* and a perimeter **. The crack flanks are
not considered to be part of the perimeter. Tractions Ti are prescribed along a part *T* of
the perimeter, while along another part displacements may be prescribed. It is assumed
that the crack flanks are traction free, i.e. they are not in any way mechanically loaded.
Consequently the loading system can perform work only along *T*.

   Recall that the potential energy of an elastic body and its loading system was found
as

Up = Uo + Ua  F .                                          (4.2)

The purpose of this equation was to express the potential energy change owing to the
introduction of a crack. The term Uo represents the potential energy for the uncracked
configuration, and therefore can be considered as the elastic strain energy of the body
minus the work performed by the loading system, both before a crack is present. There-
fore the terms in equation (4.2) can be rearranged by combining the strain energy parts
and the work parts. Expressing the strain energy as an integral of the strain energy den-

Potential Energy Change Owing to Crack Growth

Consider the difference in potential energy, 'Up, between two cases where the crack
length in the body differs by an amount 'a. The prescribed loads, i.e. tractions along *T*
and possibly displacements along some other part of **, are identical for the two cases
considered. Using equation (6.8), while denoting the displacement and strain energy
density differences between the two cases by 'Ui and 'W respectively, we obtain

Note that in the latter expression the line integral is conveniently evaluated along the
whole body perimeter ** instead of along *T* only. This is permitted because either Ti or
'Ui vanishes along the part of ** not belonging to *T*.

   Using equation (6.9), the decrease in potential energy per increment of crack growth,
dUp/da, can be expressed in terms of the following limit:

   Figure 6.5. Elastic body in which an arbitrary area A is defined embedding the crack tip.

   The integration domains used in equation (6.10) refer to the elastic body as a whole.
To show that this is not strictly necessary, consider an arbitrary part of the body which
however still includes the crack tip, as shown in figure 6.5. This part of the body has an
area A and a perimeter *. As before, the crack flanks are not assumed to be part of the
perimeter, so in fact * is a contour surrounding the crack tip starting and ending some-
where on the respective crack flanks.

   For the part of the body A*A the decrease in potential energy per increment of crack
growth can be expressed as

© da ¹A*A
                   *o                 A*A

where the limit of equation (6.10) is now expressed in terms of derivatives, and *o is the
curve bounding the area A*A. We will now apply the principle of virtual work to the
area A*A. The virtual work equation (6.7) must hold for any kinematically admissible

virtual displacement field GUi. Here we choose the displacement field resulting from a
virtual crack extension Ga, i.e.

GUi = dUi da Ga .                                       (6.12)

This displacement field is kinematically admissible because the area A*A does not
contain the crack tip singularity caused by crack growth.

    Although for an infinitely sharp crack both displacement and stress can be expected to become singu-
lar at the tip, these singularities will disappear in the case of a blunted crack tip (see for example equation
(2.28) derived for the linear elastic case). When considering crack growth, however, the situation is inher-
ently different. The reason is that new traction-free surface is created at material points which previously
were loaded to some finite extent. Therefore the displacement field involved in crack growth (equation
6.12) will be singular at the tip, even if the tip is blunted.

   The strain energy density field, GW, corresponding to the virtual displacement Gui of
142                     Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

equation (6.12) can be calculated using equations (6.6) and (6.3), and can be written as
dW/da·Ga. By substitution into the virtual work equation (6.7), it follows that

     ³ ³ Ti dUi da ds   dW                                  (6.13)
                        da dA = 0 ,

     *o            A*A

and therefore the area A*A has no contribution to dUp/da, the decrease in potential
energy of the whole body and its loading system per increment of crack growth. Conse-

quently, equation (6.10) can be evaluated by considering only an arbitrary but finite part
of the body in which the crack tip is embedded, i.e.2

A Moving Coordinate System

Until now the usual coordinate system has been used, i.e. the coordinates of a given
material point were fixed. At this stage it is convenient to introduce a `moving' coordi-
nate system with its origin at the crack tip irrespective of the crack length a. Relative to
a fixed system x1,x2, of which the x1 axis is chosen parallel to the crack, the moving co-
ordinates X1,X2 are

     X1 = x1  a ,                                           (6.15)
     X2 = x2 .

   Consider an arbitrary quantity f that depends on position as well as crack length. This
quantity can be expressed as a function of either the fixed coordinate xi or the moving

                                             ~
coordinate Xi, i.e. f = f(x1,x2,a) or f = f (X1,X2,a). For a given material point the total de-
rivative of f with respect to the crack length a is

     df   ~   ~         dX1     ~  dX2   ~
         df  wf                wf       wf
     da = da = wX1 da + wX2 da + wa .                       (6.16)

The coordinates x1 and x2 of the point considered are independent of the crack length.
Thus

     dX1 da = d(x1a) da = 1 ,                               (6.17)

2 In the derivation of the J integral it will prove more convenient to use the limit form rather than writing
   this expression in terms of derivatives.

and furthermore, because of equation (6.15), we may write
                                                                                      (6.20)
                ~
              w f wf
              wX1 = wx1 .
Applying equations (6.17) - (6.19) to equation (6.16) gives

                      ~
              df w f wf
              da = wa  wx1 .

    The first term of the right-hand part of this expression is the change in the quantity f for a point with

constant moving coordinates Xi, thus having a fixed position relative to the crack tip. The second term
represents the correction that becomes necessary because the X1 coordinate of a material point decreases
(becomes more negative) due to the crack growth.

J as a Line Integral
Using equation (6.20) the line integral term in equation (6.14) can be written as

where Ui is the displacement expressed as a function of the moving coordinates Xi.

    The area integral of the strain energy density difference in equation (6.14) could also be expanded in

an analogous manner. In order to express J in the form of a line integral, a conversion would then be re-
quired of the area integral of wW/wx1 to a line integral. However, in the case of an infinitely sharp crack
such a conversion is not possible since the integrand is singular at the tip. The way in which Rice deals

with this problem, reference 2 of the bibliography, is described in the following.

   The area integral of equation (6.14) should be evaluated over an area A. Obviously
the position of this area is not affected by crack growth. However, straightforward
evaluation of an area integral in terms of the moving coordinate system Xi would in-
volve an integration area that moves with the growing crack. Therefore a correction of
the integration area becomes necessary. Figure 6.6 schematically shows the principle.
Denoting the strain energy density for the initial crack length, a, as Wo, the area integral
of equation (6.14) can be expanded as

                            1­                                    ½

         A                                             A

The second integral refers to the initial crack length a. In this case the relation between
moving coordinates Xi and fixed coordinates xi (equation 6.15) is independent of the

crack length difference 'a. Therefore, the integration area for this integral is not af-
fected by the use of moving coordinates and remains equal to area A. For the first inte-
gral, however, the crack length is a+'a. If we were to integrate over the area A while
using moving coordinates, we would refer to the original area A moved in the positive
X1 direction over a distance 'a. To correct for this an integration area 'AL, with a width
'a, must be added on the left side of area A and likewise an area 'AR must be sub-
tracted on the right side. Thus, using moving coordinates Xi and denoting the strain en-

The steps (1) - (3) in this expansion require some additional explanation:

1) The first limit is to be evaluated for a point having a fixed position relative to the
                                                                                               ~

   crack tip. Therefore this expression is converted to the partial derivative wW/wa, i.e.
   keeping the moving coordinates Xi constant.

        Note that until now this type of limit expression was converted to a total derivative (cf. equations
    (6.11) and (6.21)). However, in this conversion it was implicitly assumed that material points were
    considered, i.e. the fixed coordinates xi remained constant. For this case the total derivative with re-
    spect to crack length is equivalent to the partial derivative.

2) The areas 'AL and 'AR both have a width (in the X1 direction) of 'a. Therefore, in
                                              ~o ~                                            W~ o,
the  limit  of  'a  o  0,  the  integral  of  W +'W  over  this  width  is  equal  to  'a  ×         since
~
'W o 0. Thus in the limit the area integrals are converted to line integrals along the

contour parts corresponding to the areas 'AL and 'AR. These contour parts are de-

noted as *L and *R respectively. At the same time 'a in the denominator cancels out.

Furthermore, a transition is made from moving coordinate X2 to fixed coordinate x2
     ~o
and  W   is  written   as  W.

3) Since the line integrals along *L and *R should yield a positive value, they must both

be evaluated in the positive x2 direction. Consequently, the two integrals can be re-

placed by a single line integral along *, evaluated in a counterclockwise direction.

   Substituting equations (6.21) and (6.23) in equation (6.14), the decrease in potential
energy per increment of crack growth can be expressed as

                           ~            wUi              ~

   The virtual work equation (6.7) will be applied once more using the virtual dis-
placement field

                    ~                                                                         (6.25)
                  wUi
            GUi = wa Ga .

    Note that this displacement field is different from the one described by equation (6.12). The latter field
described the displacement of points with constant fixed coordinates xi, i.e. actual material points. The
current field, however, describes the displacement of points with constant moving coordinates Xi, i.e.
points with a fixed position relative to the crack tip. The consequence is that this field is kinematically
admissible throughout the entire body, since it represents the infinitesimal displacement change owing to
an infinitesimal increase in crack length, a value which is not singular even at the (moving) crack tip.

The strain energy density field, GW, corresponding to the virtual displacement field of
                                           ~

equation (6.25) can be written as wW/wa·Ga. Substituting GUi and GW in the virtual work
equation (6.7), we obtain3

3 Note that for evaluating the line integral in the virtual work equation (6.7) the crack flanks need not be
   considered since they are assumed traction-free. Therefore the current definition of * is compatible
   with that used in equation (6.7).

It turns out that the first and the third term in equation (6.24) cancel each other. Thus we
can finally write dUp/da in terms of a single line integral. In view of the energy defini-
tion of J given in equation (6.1), this also leads to the expression for the J integral, i.e.

              *

Thus for a crack with the tip pointing in the positive x1 direction, this expression enables
J, or the decrease in potential energy per increment of crack growth, to be evaluated as a
line integral along an arbitrary path surrounding the crack tip, starting somewhere on the
lower crack flank and ending somewhere on the upper crack flank. The integration
should be performed in a counterclockwise direction.

   Note that the fact that an arbitrary integration path may be used implies that the J in-
tegral is path independent.

Alternative Expression for the J Integral

Equation (6.27) is often written differently. Consider an increment ds along the contour
*. If ds = (dx1,dx2) is the vector coinciding with this part of the contour, then

     dx1 = n2ds and dx2 = n1ds ,                            (6.28)

where n = (n1,n2) is the outward-directed unit vector normal to the contour.

    Equation (6.28) can be derived as follows. The scalar product of the vectors ds = (dx1,dx2) and
n = (n1,n2) is zero because n is perpendicular to ds. Thus n1dx1+n2dx2 = 0. The vector product n × ds is
perpendicular to both n and ds and has the value (0,0,n1dx2n2dx1). The absolute value (length) of this
vector, n × ds, is |n||ds|sin(90°) = ds, because the absolute value of the unit vector |n| = 1, while the length
of vector ds is defined as ds. The length of n × ds is also equal to n1dx2n2dx1. We now have two equa-
tions for the two unknown variables dx1 and dx2: ds = n1dx2n2dx1 and n1dx1+n2dx2 = 0. Solving these two
equations for dx1 and dx2 leads to the result of equation (6.28).

   Substituting equation (6.28) for dx2 in equation (6.27) we obtain:

Usefulness of the J Integral Concept
In this section a path-independent integral expression has been derived for J, represent-
ing a nonlinear elastic energy release rate. Two observations are made:
6. Basic Aspects of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics  147

· Under certain restrictions this nonlinear elastic energy release rate can be used as an
   elastic-plastic energy release rate. This is interesting because in LEFM there is a
   critical value for the energy release rate, Gc, which predicts the onset of crack exten-
   sion.

· Path independence of the J integral allows the contour * to be chosen just as small as
   the crack tip area. This illustrates that J is in fact a measure for the stresses and
   strains at the very tip (see also section 6.5). It seems reasonable to assume that the
   onset of crack extension is determined by these stresses and strains.

Both observations suggest that there is a critical J value, Jc, at which crack growth is
initiated. By analogy with Gc in LEFM, for a loaded cracked component calculated J
values can be compared to the critical value, Jc, characteristic for a given material. Thus
a fracture mechanics analysis can be carried out: J must remain less than Jc.

    Note that path independence of J also allows calculation along a contour remote from the crack tip.
Such a contour can be chosen to contain only elastic loads and displacements. Thus an elastic-plastic en-
ergy release rate can be obtained from an elastic calculation along a contour for which loads and dis-
placements are known.

6.4 Remarks Concerning the J Integral Concept

   The J integral concept is not easy to understand. However, the concept is undeniably
useful, and so at this point it is also worthwhile to direct some remarks to the derivation,
applications and restrictions of J:

1) At the beginning of section 6.3 it was stated that J would be derived assuming the
   deformation behaviour to be nonlinear elastic and therefore reversible. But plastic
   deformation is not reversible, and the energy dissipated cannot be transformed into
   other kinds of energy. Thus strictly speaking, concepts such as strain energy density
   and potential energy are not legitimately usable with true plastic deformation.

2) It was also stated that the assumption of nonlinear elasticity is compatible with actual
   deformation behaviour only if no unloading occurs in any part of the material. But
   during crack growth the newly formed crack flanks are completely unloaded from
   stresses as high as Vys (or even higher in the case of plane strain and/or work hard-
   ening). Therefore J is in principle applicable only up to the beginning of crack exten-
   sion and not for crack growth. However, under certain restrictions J can be used to
   characterize crack growth. This will be discussed further in section 8.3.

3) The controlling parameters in the derivation of J are the stress and strain fields in the
   cracked body. In order to simplify the analysis, the derivation was limited to a two-
   dimensional configuration. Stresses and strains in the thickness direction were not
   taken into account, although they obviously affect the assumed nonlinear relation
   between the in-plane stresses and strains. Full plane strain or plane stress conditions
   can indeed be described two-dimensionally. For intermediate conditions the effect of
   thickness stress and strain will vary as a function of the thickness coordinate and the
   question arises whether J can be used in such cases. However the J integral concept
   can be fully extended to three-dimensional crack geometries, see reference 4. J then
148                Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   has a local value that varies along the crack front, but loses its meaning as a path-
   independent line integral.
4) By definition, J for the linear elastic case is equal to G and we may write

              K2                                       (6.30)
     J = G = Ec ,

   where Ec = E for plane stress and Ec = E/(1  Q2) for plane strain. Thus the J integral
   concept is compatible with LEFM.
   Note that by analogy with G the dimensions of J are [ENERGY]/[LENGTH] per unit
   thickness of material, i.e. Joules/m2 or N/m.
5) As stated before, it is to be expected that there is a critical material parameter, Jc,
   which predicts the onset of crack extension. Methods for measuring Jc will be pre-
   sented in chapter 7.
6) Obtaining solutions for the J integral in actual specimens or components turns out to
   be difficult. It is generally necessary to use finite element techniques. However,
   some simple expressions have been developed for standard specimens. They will
   also be presented in chapter 7.
7) The J integral concept has been developed mainly in the USA as a fracture criterion
   for materials used in the power generating industry, particularly nuclear installations.
   In this area of application high level technology and costly production techniques are
   generally used and no large differences are to be expected for material behaviour in
   laboratory specimens and actual structures. For instance: local differences in behav-
   iour of welded joints are not normally accounted for. This contrasts with the COD
   approach, which will be discussed in section 6.6. This concept was developed in the
   UK at the Welding Institute and is obviously more directed to the design of welded
   structures (see section 6.7).

6.5 J as a Stress Intensity Parameter

   From work done by Hutchinson (references 5 and 6) and independently by Rice and
Rosengren (reference 7) the crack tip stresses and strains can be expressed in terms of J
according to the so-called HRR solution:

                                     1                 (6.31)

               § E J· n+1 -
     Vij = Vo ¨ 2 r¸ Vij(T,n) ,

               ©D Vo In ¹

                                        n

             Vo § E J· n+1 -
     Hij = D E ¨ 2 r¸ Hij(T,n) .

                 ©D Vo In ¹

They assumed a power-law hardening material, i.e. the relation between the uniaxial
stress V and strain H is given by the so-called Ramberg-Osgood relation

     H V §V·n                                          (6.32)
        = +D¨ ¸ ,

     Ho Vo ©Vo¹
6. Basic Aspects of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics  149

where D is a dimensionless constant, Ho = Vo/E with Vo usually equal to the yield stress,
and n is the strain hardening exponent. In in equations (6.31) is a dimensionless constant
depending on the strain hardening exponent n and the stress state (plane stress or plane

              --
strain), and Vij and Hij are dimensionless functions of n, the angle T and the stress state.

                --
Values of In, Vij and Hij are given in tabular form by Shih (reference 8).

   Note that for n = 1 (linear elastic material behaviour), equations (6.31) show a 1/ r
singularity, which is consistent with LEFM. In fact it can be shown that for n = 1 equa-
tions (6.31) become identical to the elastic solution given by equations (2.24). On the
other hand, for n = f, i.e. ideal plastic material behaviour, the solution becomes equal to
the so-called Prandtl slip-line field solution (reference 1).

   Equations (6.31) imply that the stress/strain field in the direct vicinity of a crack tip
is completely characterized by a single parameter J. Different geometries with identical
J values can be expected to have the same stresses and strains near the crack tip, and
thus show identical responses. Therefore J can be considered as a single fracture me-
chanics parameter for the elastic-plastic regime (with the restriction of no unloading),
analogous to K for the linear elastic regime.

    Note that the HRR singularity contains an anomaly similar to the LEFM singularity, namely that both
predict infinite stresses for ro0. However the large plastic strains at the crack tip cause the crack to blunt,
which reduces the stresses locally. The HRR solution is thus not valid all the way to the tip. At a distance
less than twice the CTOD value the HRR singularity becomes invalid (reference 9).

6.6 The Crack Opening Displacement (COD) Approach

   The COD approach was introduced by Wells, reference 10 of the bibliography, as
long ago as 1961. The background philosophy to the approach is as follows. In the re-
gimes of fracture-dominant failure, cases A, B, C and partly D in figure 6.1, the stresses
and strains in the vicinity of a crack or defect are responsible for failure. At crack tips
the stresses will always exceed the yield strength and plastic deformation will occur.
Thus failure is brought about by stresses and hence plastic strains exceeding certain re-
spective limits. Wells argued that the stress at a crack tip always reaches the critical
value (in the purely elastic case V o f). If this is so then it is the plastic strain in the
crack tip region that controls fracture.
150                   Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   A measure of the amount of crack tip plastic strain is the displacement of the crack
flanks, especially at or very close to the tip. The Crack Opening Displacement (COD) at
the original crack tip is called Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) or Gt (see fig-
ure 6.7): an initially sharp crack blunts by plastic deformation, resulting in a finite dis-
placement at the original tip.4

   Thus it might be expected that at the onset of fracture the crack tip opening dis-
placement, Gt, has a characteristic critical value, Gtcrit, for a particular material and there-
fore could be used as a fracture criterion.

   In 1966 Burdekin and Stone provided an improved basis for the COD concept. They
used the Dugdale strip yield model to find an expression for CTOD. Their analysis has
already been reviewed in section 3.3 of the course and is given in full in reference 11 of
the bibliography to this chapter. The strip yield model assumes plane stress conditions
and ideal plastic (i.e. non-hardening) material behaviour. The result is

     Gt = 8Vysa SE ln sec SV 2Vys .                                   (3.19)

In sections 3.2 and 3.3 it was also shown that under LEFM conditions there are direct
relations between Gt and KI. Thus, for the Dugdale analysis

                2                                                     (3.20)

           KI
     Gt = EVys .

    Note that this simple relation is obtained by taking only the first term of a series expansion of the
ln sec part of equation (3.19), which is only allowed for V << Vys. The actual relationship between CTOD
and KI also depends on stress state and material behaviour. These effects are represented by the plastic
constraint factor C (see section 3.5), i.e.

                         K I2
                 Gt = ECVys .

C is equal to 1.0 for plane stress and taken to be 2.0 for plane strain.

For the Irwin plastic zone analysis an analogous relation was found:

                   2                                                  (3.8)

          4 KI
     Gt = S EVys .

The foregoing relations between Gt and KI are important because they show that in the
linear elastic regime the COD approach is compatible with LEFM concepts. However,
the COD approach is not basically limited to the LEFM range of applicability, since oc-
currence of crack tip plasticity is inherent to it.

   The major disadvantage of the COD approach is that equation (3.19) is valid only for
an infinite plate with a central crack with length 2a, and it is very difficult to derive
similar formulae for practical geometries. This contrasts with the stress intensity factor

4 Strictly speaking, a crack in a purely elastic material will have no CTOD. This is of course a hypo-
   thetical limiting case.
6. Basic Aspects of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics  151

and J integral concepts. Thus in the first instance a characteristic value of CTOD at the
onset of fracture can be used to compare the crack resistance of materials. It cannot be
used, however, to calculate a critical crack length in a structure. In an attempt to over-
come this disadvantage the COD design curve has been developed (see chapter 8).

6.7 Remarks on the COD Approach

Some additional remarks are given here concerning use of the COD approach:

1) When comparing the crack resistance of materials it is necessary to obtain Gtcrit. It
   has been shown experimentally that the COD depends on specimen size, geometry
   and plastic constraint, and so a standard COD test has been developed. This standard
   does not, however, precisely define the event at which Gt is to be considered critical.
   There are three possibilities: Gc, the value at instability without prior crack extension;
   Gu, the value at the point of instability after stable crack extension; and Gm, the value
   at maximum load (which is not necessarily identical to the other values, e.g. for
   specimens that still exhibit stable crack extension beyond the point of maximum
   load). The standard test is discussed further in chapter 7.

2) The COD approach has been developed mainly in the UK: more specifically, at the
   Welding Institute. The chief purpose was to find a characterizing parameter for
   welds and welded components of structural steels, which are difficult to simulate on
   a laboratory scale. Thus the COD approach is more strongly directed towards use in
   design of welded structures. (This, of course, does not mean that COD values cannot
   be used to compare and select materials.)

3) In welded steel structures the welds are most liable to fracture, not the material itself.
   At present the COD approach is a reliable way of accounting for the crack resistance
   of welds, since several weld quality specifications incorporating COD exist.

6.8 Relation Between J and CTOD

   The J integral and COD concepts have been developed mainly in the USA and UK
respectively. In the first instance the two concepts seem to be unrelated. In the late
1970s a number of expressions relating J and CTOD were published. They all take the
form

J = MVysGt ,                                            (6.33)

where M varies between 1.15 and 2.95. General acceptance of equation (6.33) is indi-
cated by the use of a similar expression J = GtVo in the blunting line procedure for JIc
testing, see section 7.4.

   Hutchinson (reference 12 of the bibliography to this chapter) showed that derivation
of equation (6.33) is relatively simple when the Dugdale strip yield model is used, al-
though since it uses a model it does not constitute a definite proof of the relation be-
tween J and CTOD.

   Consider a Dugdale type crack as shown in figure 6.8. The Dugdale plastic zone is
152                   Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   Figure 6.8. Dugdale model with contour * around the yielded strip.

assumed to be a strip of plastically deformed material along the x1 axis carrying the
yield stress, i.e. V22 = Vys. Furthermore, the model assumes a state of plane stress, i.e.
V33 = 0. Given the symmetry of both geometry and load, the x1 and x2 axes must be
principal stress directions, meaning that V12 = 0.

   Now the J integral formula (equation 6.27) is applied to a contour * that proceeds
counterclockwise around the yielded strip at an infinitesimal distance from the x1 axis.
The contour starts and ends on the lower and upper crack flanks, respectively, at an in-
finitesimal distance from the crack tip. Thus

                               ½Gt

                *

The steps (1) - (4) in this derivation are explained here:

1) Along the contour x2 = constant, and thus dx2 = 0. Note that there is no contribution
   to J from the right-hand end of the contour, since the vertical dimension (in the x2 di-
   rection) of the contour is assumed infinitesimally small.

2) Along the contour n = (0,n2). Using equation (6.4) in combination with the stress
   tensor for the yielded strip leads to a traction

     ªT1º ª V11 0 º ª 0 º ª 0 º

                ¬          ¼

3) According to equation (6.28) ds = dx1/n2.

                 steel with Vys = 370 MPa. After reference 15.

4) Since dx2 = 0, the following holds:

              dU2 = wU2 wx1 dx1 + wU2 wx2 dx2 = wU2 wx1 dx1 .

Remarks

1) Since only the definition of the strip yield model is used, and not the derivation of
   'an, there is no restriction on the length of the plastic zone ('an). Thus Hutchinson's
   analysis is valid under both LEFM and EPFM conditions. As stated earlier, the
   analysis is not a definite proof since it uses a model. However, it clearly suggests the
   existence of a relation between J and CTOD of the type given in equation (6.33).

2) More complex analyses, often using finite element calculations, also give results of
   the form suggested by equation (6.33). The multiplication factor M is found to be a
   function of Vys/E and the strain hardening exponent n, see references 13 and 14 of
   the bibliography.

3) Experimental values of M are often | 2, e.g. figure 6.9, in contrast to equation (6.34),
   where M = 1. The higher values of M found experimentally are most probably due to
   the real plastic zone behaving differently from that assumed by the Dugdale ap-
   proach.

4) Equation (3.20), relating the CTOD to KI for LEFM conditions, can be written as

                    2                                            (6.35)

               KI G
         Gt = EVys = Vys .
154  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

Substitution into equation (6.34) gives                              (6.36)
          J = GtVys = G .

This illustrates once more that J is equal to G in the LEFM regime.

EPFM Testing

7.1 Introduction

   In chapter 6 the two most widely known concepts of Elastic-Plastic Fracture Me-
chanics, the J integral and Crack Opening Displacement (COD) approaches, were dis-
cussed in general terms.

   This chapter will deal with test methods for obtaining values of J and CTOD, in-
cluding critical values JIc and Gtcrit. The chapter may be considered the EPFM counter-
part of chapter 5, which discussed LEFM test methods.

   The greater complexity of the J integral concept as compared to the COD concept is
clearly demonstrated by the derivations in chapter 6. This difference in complexity is
also found in the test methods. Therefore the discussion of J integral testing is subdi-
vided into three sections:
1) The original JIc test method, section 7.2.
2) Alternative methods and expressions for J, section 7.3.
3) The standard JIc test, section 7.4.
The original JIc test method requires a large amount of data analysis. This problem led
to the development of certain types of test specimen for which simple expressions for J
could be derived, and ultimately to the standard JIc test.

   Although it is not within the framework of EPFM testing, the KIc specimen size re-
quirement (see section 5.2) is further discussed in section 7.5. The reason is that the J
integral concept enables this criterion to be viewed from a different perspective.

   The COD concept is much more straightforward than the J integral, at least from the
experimental point of view. Thus only the standard Gtcrit test itself will be described,
namely in section 7.6.

   With respect to standard test methods, it has already been remarked in sections 6.4
and 6.8 that the J integral concept was developed mainly in the USA and the COD con-
cept in the UK. Consequently it is logical that the original standard for JIc was Ameri-
can (American Society for Testing and Materials) while the original COD test was the
subject of an official British Standard (British Standards Institution, BSI), see references
1 and 2 of the bibliography to this chapter. At present both organizations have incorpo-
rated the J integral concept as well as the COD concept into their test standards.

7.2 The Original JIc Test Method
   The first experimental method for determining J (more specifically JIc, the critical
156  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   Figure 7.1. The graphical procedure involved in JIc testing according to Begley and Landes.

mode I value at the onset of crack extension) was published by Begley and Landes in
1971, reference 3 of the bibliography. The method is based on the definition of J as
dUp/da, and requires graphical assessment of dUp/da. The method will be illustrated
with the help of figure 7.1, which schematically gives the graphical procedure for ob-
taining JIc.

   The procedure is as follows:

1) Load-displacement diagrams are obtained for a number of specimens precracked to
   different crack lengths (a1, a2, a3 in figure 7.1.a). Areas under the load-displacement
   curves represent the energy per unit thickness, U1, delivered to the specimens. Thus
   the shaded area in figure 7.1.a is equal to the energy term U1 for a specimen with
   crack length a3 loaded to a displacement V3.

2) U1 is plotted as a function of crack length for several constant values of displace-
   ment, figure 7.1.b.

3) The negative slopes of the U1a curves, i.e. (wU1/wa)v, are plotted against dis-

   placement for any desired crack length between the shortest and longest used in
   testing, figure 7.1.c. Since the elastic strain energy contents of a specimen is equal to

  the energy delivered to that specimen, it follows that (wU1/wa)V is equal to
  (wUa/wa)V. In section 6.3 the energy definition of J was given as:
                 7. EPFM Testing               157

dUp d
J =  da = da (F  Ua) .                         (6.1)

Since for crack extension under fixed grip conditions no work is performed by the
loading system, it follows that:

§wUp· §wUa·
J = ¨ ¸ = ¨ ¸ .                                (7.1)
© wa ¹V © wa ¹V

   Hence figure 7.1.c in fact gives J-V curves for particular crack lengths.
4) Knowledge of the displacement V at the onset of crack extension enables JIc to be

   found from the J-V curve for each initial crack length. In figure 7.1.c the value of JIc
   is schematically shown to be constant as, ideally, it should be if J is an appropriate
   criterion for the onset of crack extension.

    Knowledge of the critical displacement V is a weak step in the procedure. Begley and Landes used
materials where the maximum in the load-displacement curve characterized the onset of crack growth.
For other materials a crack extension measurement device (e.g. a potential drop measurement apparatus)
is necessary. The method of Begley and Landes has the potential to find the applied J for an unknown ge-
ometry.

   The graphical procedure described involves a large amount of data manipulation and
replotting in order to obtain J-V calibration curves and hence JIc. There are thus many
possibilities for errors, and so easier methods have been looked for, as will be discussed
in section 7.3. However, the elegance of this original test method, in making direct use
of the energy definition of J, remains and it is still used as a reference to check more re-
cent developments.

7.3 Alternative Methods and Expressions for J

   The main contribution to seeking alternatives for the Begley and Landes method was
made by Rice et al., reference 4 of the bibliography. Their analysis leads to simple ex-
pressions for J for certain types of specimen. However, before these expressions can be
discussed it is necessary to consider alternative definitions of J.

   Recall the expressions for Up and J given in equations (4.2) and (6.1) respectively

Up = Uo + Ua  F                                (4.2)

J = dUp da . (6.1)

We will now consider the value of J for two extreme cases, namely for crack extension
under constant displacement V and crack extension under constant load per unit thick-
ness P. It follows that in both cases the change in potential energy due to a crack exten-
sion 'a is

'Up = Up|a+'a  Up|a = 'Ua  'F . (7.2)

Figure 7.2. Crack extension in a nonlinear elastic body under (a) fixed grip and (b) constant
               load conditions.

For the case of a fixed grip condition, see figure 7.2.a, we may write

               V           V        V

     ³ ³ ³ 'Ua = P|a + 'a dV  P|a dV = 'P dV and 'F = 0 (7.3)

               0           0        0

and thus, using equation (7.2), the change in potential energy is equal to

                     V

     ³ 'Up = 'Ua  'F = 'P dV .                                              (7.4)

Note that 'P is negative and that 'Up is equal to minus the shaded area between the
curves for crack lengths a and a+'a in figure 7.2.a. From equation (6.1) it follows that

tions J is

while on the other hand, for the case of constant load conditions

                                                                      P                P

Thus the alternative definitions of J, for crack extension under fixed grip or constant

load conditions are

Note the different sign for fixed grip and constant load conditions. This is analogous to
the formulae for G, equations (4.23).

   Using equation (7.10), Rice et al. showed in 1973 that it is possible to determine JIc
from a single test of certain types of specimen. As an example, J for a deeply cracked
bar in bending was derived as
160               Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

        Tc

      ³2                                                         (7.11)

     J = Bb M dTc ,

               0

where B is the thickness of the bar, b is the size of the uncracked ligament ahead of the
crack, M is the bending moment and Tc is the part of the total bending angle T due to
introduction of the crack. More recently, see reference 5 of the bibliography to this
chapter, it was found that J is evaluated more accurately by simply using the total
bending angle T instead of Tc, i.e.

               T                                                 (7.12)

      ³2

     J = Bb M dT

               0

Equation (7.12) is important, since it applies to a basic cracked configuration. Therefore a derivation

is given in some detail here with the help of figure 7.3. For this deeply cracked bar loaded in bending the

ligament size, b, is chosen small compared to the width of the bar, W, so that it may be safely assumed

that all plastic deformation is confined to this ligament.

    Mc is the bending moment per unit thickness, i.e. Mc = M/B. We will use the definition of J for fixed
grip conditions, i.e. the first form of equation (7.10). P and V are converted to Mc and T by assuming the
moment is applied through three-point bending. The load per unit thickness, P, can be written as 4Mc/L,

where L is the span of the bend specimen. Furthermore, since plasticity is confined to the ligament, the

sides of the beam will remain straight and V is equal to TL/4. Finally, since b = W  a it follows that w/wa
= w/wb. The first form of equation (7.10) can now be written as
                     T           T

    Since this expression cannot be evaluated experimentally, an analytical relation must be found be-
tween T, b and Mc. Rice et al. argued that a dimensional analysis can be used to obtain this relation. How-
ever, here an alternative reasoning will be used.

Figure 7.4. Stress distribution in the critical ligament

    Elastic  perfectly plastic material behaviour is assumed, leading to a distribution in the ligament of
the stress component parallel to the neutral line, Vx, as follows (see figure 7.4):

         ­   2y     for |y| < 1/2e                           (7.14)

Vx(y) = ®    Vys
         °
         ¯

where y is the distance from the neutral line. The moment corresponding to this stress distribution can be
straightforwardly calculated as

      +½b                                                    (7.15)

  ³ §b2 e2·

Mc = y Vx(y) dy = Vys© 4  12¹ .

      ½b

    The width e of the elastic part of the ligament is now estimated by assuming that in the small region
around the ligament the neutral line takes the shape of a circle segment with radius R and that all planes
normal to the neutral line remain normal to that line. Under these assumptions the strain, Hx, parallel to the
neutral line can be written as a function of y:

        2S(Ry)  2SR y                                        (7.16)
Hx(y) = 2SR = R .

At the boundary between the elastic and plastic parts of the ligament, i.e. y = ±1/2e, the absolute value of Hx
is approximately equal to the yield stress divided by Ec, i.e. E for plane stress and E/(1Q2) for plane
strain. Thus using equation (7.16) it follows that

Vys 1 | /2 e or e | 2RVys .
Ec R                Ec

Now it is assumed that the length of the circular shaped segment of the neutral line in the region around
the ligament is roughly of the order of the size of the ligament b, i.e. RT | b. This leads to

e | 2bVys .                                                  (7.17)

The significance of this equation is that

     Mc = b2 F(T) ,                                        (7.19)

where the function F(T) depends on material properties such as E, Q, Vys, and, in the case of a work hard-
ening material, on the work hardening exponent n. We may now write

   For a deeply cracked bar it is reasonable to assume that all plasticity is restricted to
the ligament, and thus the two halves of the bar remain straight. This enables equation
(7.12) to be rewritten as the more practical expression

                    V                                      (7.22)

     ³ J = 2Bb P dV ,

               0

where P is the load in terms of a force, i.e. no longer defined per unit thickness, and V is
the displacement in the load line, termed the load-line displacement.

   In a JIc test the load P acting on a cracked bar is measured as a function of the load-
line displacement V. Using equation (7.22) J can then be determined for any displace-
ment by calculating the area under the P-V curve up to that displacement, U. At the on-
set of crack extension, J is equal to JIc. Therefore

     2U                     2Ucr
     J = Bb and JIc = Bb .                                 (7.23)

where Ucr is the area under the P-V curve at the onset of crack extension.
   Hence in principle JIc can be determined by performing one test only in which the

specimen is loaded until the onset of crack extension. However this is not normally
done. The reason is that detection of the beginning of crack extension is difficult. It can
only be done with costly apparatus as potential drop, acoustic emission, ultrasonic, eddy
current etc., where each has its specific difficulties. An alternative is to make a number
of tests whereby each specimen is loaded to give a small but different crack extension
'a. Then the values of J (which are, strictly speaking, invalid) are plotted versus 'a and
extrapolated to 'a = 0 in order to obtain JIc. An example of this method is given in fig-
ure 7.5.

   J-'a lines like those in figure 7.5 are called J resistance curves, by analogy with the
7. EPFM Testing  163

   Figure 7.5. J-'a plots for A-533B steel, after reference 6 of the bibliography.

LEFM R-curve. This seems slightly misleading, since J is strictly valid only up to the
beginning of crack extension and not beyond it. However, it must be noted that under
certain restrictions J resistance curves can be used to predict stable crack extension.
This subject is discussed in chapter 8.

   The J integral expression in equation (7.23) and the multiple specimen method just
described, form the basis for the standard JIc test, which is discussed in the next section.

7.4 The Standard JIc Test

   Before publication of the standard JIc test some ten different procedures had been
used. Chipperfield (reference 7) reviewed these methods and showed that JIc values ob-
tained in different ways varied by up to 20%. This clearly demonstrated the need for a
standard test.

Original JIc Test Standard
A proposal for a standard JIc test was published in 1979. This proposal became an
ASTM standard and was first published as such in 1981 under the designation ASTM
E 813, reference 1 of the bibliography. This standard describes JIc determination using
three-point notched bend (SENB) and compact tension (CT) specimens. Roughly these
are the same specimen geometries as those for KIc testing (see figures 5.2 and 5.3), but
there are a number of differences in detail. For both specimen configurations J is given
simply by a form of equation (7.23), i.e. J = (2U/Bb)·f(a/W), where f(a/W) depends on
the specimen type.

Revised Test Standard
In 1989 a revised version of standard E 813 was published, which is referenced as num-
ber 8 of the bibliography. In this standard the same specimen geometries are described,
164               Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

but for experimental reasons J is evaluated in a somewhat different way. The load-line
displacement is divided into an elastic and a plastic part, i.e. V = Vel + Vpl. Consequently,
reverting to equation (7.10), with P now no longer defined per unit thickness, we may
write

     P            P                    P

                  1 §wVel·          1 §wVpl·

     0            0                    0

Expressing Vel in terms of the specimen compliance, i.e. Vel = C·P, it follows that (cf.
equations (4.16.b) and (4.19))

        P                        P

        0                        0

Since the SENB and CT specimens have the same geometry as the standard KIc speci-
mens, KI can be calculated using equations (5.1) and (5.2).

   Using the same reasoning as given in the previous section, the plastic part of J, Jpl,
can be related to the area under the P-Vpl curve up to the current value of Vpl, Upl. The
ASTM standard uses the relation

           KUpl                                                    (7.26)
     Jpl = BNb ,

where K = plastic work factor = ®­2 for SENB specimens

                                 ¯2 + 0.522 /W for CT specimensb

     BN = net specimen thickness, which is equal to B if no side grooves are present.

Figure 7.6 illustrates how the plastic work Upl is calculated. First the total work U is
determined by integrating the P-V curve and then the elastic part of the work is sub-
tracted. This elastic part is equal to 1/2VelP or, using the elastic specimen compliance C,
equal to 1/2CP2.

   Clearly C has to be known to carry out this procedure. Note also that C depends on
the current crack length. It can be determined either by calculating it using the formulae
given in the ASTM standard that express C as a function of crack length, specimen di-
mensions and Young's modulus or by measuring it directly through partial unloading
during the test (see also under the next subheading).

JIc Test Procedure
The steps involved in setting up and conducting a JIc test are:
1) Selection of specimen type (notch bend or compact tension) and preparation of shop

   drawings.
7. EPFM Testing  165

    Figure 7.6 The part of the area under the P-V curve that represents the plastic work Upl.

2) Specimen manufacture.
3) Fatigue precracking.
4) Obtain test fixtures and clip gauge for crack opening displacement measurement.
5) Testing.
6) Data analysis.
7) Determination of a provisional JIc (JQ).
8) Final check for JIc validity.

   Steps (1)  (5) will be concisely reviewed here insofar as they differ from similar
steps for KIc testing in section 5.2. Steps (6)  (8) are considered under the next sub-
heading in this section.

   For both SENB and CT specimens the initial crack length (i.e. notch plus fatigue
precrack) must be greater than 0.5 W to ensure validity of the formulae used to evaluate
J. The maximum crack length is 0.75 W, while a value of 0.6 W is usually optimum
from an experimental viewpoint.

   A special feature of JIc testing is that the clip gauge has to be positioned in the load
line. For the CT specimen this means that the shape of the starter notch is different to

   Figure 7.7. CT specimen starter notches.
166               Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

that used in KIc testing, figure 7.7. Note that a chevron starter notch for JIc testing is not
specifically recommended. This is also true for the SENB specimen. Experience has
shown that a straight starter notch is usually sufficient.

   In order to obtain sufficiently sharp crack tips the specimen should be fatigue pre-
cracked with the maximum load not exceeding 40% of the limit load for plastic collapse
PL, which can be calculated from

     SENB specimen PL =  4B(W  a)2Vo                           (7.27)

                         3S

     CT specimen        B(W  a)2Vo                             (7.28)
                  PL = (2W + a) ,

where Vo is called the flow stress and is typically the average of the yield strength Vys
and the ultimate tensile strength Vuts, i.e. Vo = 1/2(Vys + Vuts). The use of Vo is to account
for strain hardening.

   The JIc tests must be carried out under controlled displacement conditions in order to
obtain stable crack extension over the whole test range. This means that preferably an
electro-mechanical testing machine must be used.

   In section 7.3 it was stated that the basis for the standard JIc test is the multiple
specimen method, i.e. a number of specimens are loaded to give small but different
amounts of crack extension 'a. However, ASTM E 813 does allow a truly single
specimen JIc determination. This involves the use of some technique for measuring the
current crack extension during a test, enabling the determination of the J resistance
curve defined in section 7.3.

   A frequently used method for crack-length monitoring is the unloading compliance
technique. After loading the specimen until a small amount of crack extension occurs,

Figure 7.8. An example of the unloading compliance technique.
7. EPFM Testing                                                          167

the load is partially removed and subsequently reapplied, see figure 7.8. To avoid re-
versed plasticity having any effect on the test results, the maximum unloading range is
set to the smaller of 50% of the current load or 20% of PL. In the load-displacement
(PV) diagram this loading procedure is reflected as the first part of the elastic compli-
ance line for unloading. From the resulting elastic compliance, C, the instantaneous
crack length, a, and thus also 'a = a  ao can be calculated. ASTM E 813 gives formu-
lae equating the dimensionless crack length a/W to the dimensionless compliance for
SENB and CT specimens. The current values for a, 'a, P and the P-V curve up to the
current displacement lead to one point on the J'a curve. By repeating this process a
number of times a J resistance curve can be obtained from a single specimen. A disad-
vantage of the method is that an accurate measurement of the unloading compliance line
requires suitable equipment and sufficient experimental skill.

   For both the multiple and the single specimen technique the specimen is broken af-
terwards to measure the crack extension visually from the crack surface. Note that for
the single specimen technique this final crack extension is determined only to verify the
accuracy of the unloading compliance technique. To be able to measure the crack exten-
sion a marking technique must be employed for distinguishing between 'a and the re-
sidual fracture due to breaking open the specimen after testing. One possibility is heat
tinting, i.e. heating the specimen in air to cause oxide discoloration of existing crack
surfaces. Another is to fatigue cycle after the JIc test. Details of these techniques are
given in reference 8 of the bibliography.

   The measurement of the crack extension gives specific problems. J integral test
specimens are usually thick, such that `crack front tunnelling' occurs during both pre-
cracking and JIc testing. This is illustrated schematically in figure 7.9. Experience has
shown that to obtain consistent values of J and JIc it is necessary to take averages of at
least nine measurements of a and 'a equally spaced across the specimen thickness, and
to count the averages of side surface crack lengths as one measurement only.

Data Analysis and Determination of JIc
The data analysis consists of calculating J values for a number of crack extensions 'a.

Figure 7.9. Schematic of a JIc test specimen broken open after testing.
168  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

The elastic part of each J value, Jel, is evaluated with equation (7.25) by substituting the
KI value corresponding to the load and the crack length at the moment the crack exten-
sion 'a was reached. For Jpl the load-displacement record is analysed to obtain the area
Upl under the curve up to the P-V point corresponding to crack extension 'a. Values of
Jpl are then calculated by inserting Upl and values of the crack length a into equation
(7.26).

   These J-'a points are used in determining the provisional JIc (JQ). However, de-
pending on their value, some points may yet turn out to be unacceptable. To check for

acceptability and at the same time determine JQ a plot more or less similar to figure 7.5
must be constructed as shown schematically in figure 7.10.

Figure 7.10. Schematic determination of acceptable J values and of JQ.

The procedure for constructing this figure is:

1) Plot the J-'a data points, discarding points with J values exceeding bVo/15.
2) Draw a theoretical blunting line J = 2Vo'a.
3) Draw a 0.2 mm offset line parallel to the blunting line.
4) Draw 0.15 and 1.5 mm exclusion lines parallel to the blunting line and discard all J-

   'a points that fall outside the region bounded by these lines.
5) There must be at least 4 J-'a data points remaining and they must be distributed suf-

   ficiently even within the region between the exclusion lines (see reference 8).
6) Using the acceptable J-'a points, draw a power law regression line of the form

   J = C1('a)C2 by determining a least squares linear regression relation according to:

     ln J = ln C1 + C2 ln ('a) .                                        (7.29)
             7. EPFM Testing  169

7) Determine the intersection of the power law regression line with the 0.2 mm offset
   line. The resulting J value is designated JQ. The ASTM standard suggests an iterative
   procedure to determine the point of intersection with sufficient accuracy.

8) Draw two vertical lines through the intersections of the exclusion lines with the re-
   gression line. These vertical lines represent the minimum and maximum crack exten-
   sions. If data points fall outside this range they should be discarded and the proce-
   dure should be repeated starting at point 5.

   Finally, for JQ to qualify as a valid JIc, it is required that:
1) The specimen dimensions satisfy the equation

B and W  a both > 25 JQ Vo .  (7.30)

2) The slope of the regression line at JQ is smaller than Vo.
3) None of the test specimens have experienced brittle fracture.
4) No excessive crack front tunnelling has occurred (see reference 8).
5) For the single specimen technique the predicted final crack extension does not devi-

   ate more than 15% from the crack extension measured directly from the crack sur-
   face.

Some Background to the JIc Determination

1) The minimum thickness requirement B > 25 JQ/Vo ensures that crack extension 'a
   occurs under plane strain. It is an empirical requirement based on tests with steels.

2) The minimum ligament length requirement b = (W  a) > 25 JQ/Vo is also empirical
   and is intended to prevent net section yield, see section 6.1. For this same reason all
   measured J values exceeding bVo/15 are discarded.

3) The blunting line procedure was adopted to account for the apparent increase in

   crack length owing to crack tip blunting. This apparent increase in crack length will

   be less than or equal to the blunted crack tip radius, which in turn is half the crack
   opening displacement Gt. Thus the apparent 'a d 0.5Gt. Assuming Gt = J/Vo, a rela-
   tion discussed earlier in section 6.8, the apparent crack extension due to crack blunt-
   ing can be accounted for by 'a = 0.5Gt = J/2Vo, or

J = 2Vo'a .                   (7.31)

   Although the concept of accounting for crack blunting is correct, the use of equation
   (7.31) can still be criticised for two reasons, which are discussed in points 5 and 6.
4) JQ is not the J value at the initiation of crack extension, since it is determined as the
   intersection of the 0.2 mm offset line and the power law regression line. In the origi-
   nal ASTM standard (see reference 1) JQ was determined as the intersection of a lin-
   ear regression line and the blunting line and could thus be regarded as J at initiation.
   This procedure, however, was found to introduce much scatter in JIc values, because
   the transition between the blunting process and actual crack extension is not always

   distinct.
170  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

 Figure 7.11. Influence of work hardening on JQ estimation error.

   Note that the current approach is analogous to that for quantities like the yield
   strength defined at 0.2% offset strain and KIc defined at 2% stable crack growth.
5) The blunting line and the J resistance curve are influenced by work hardening. With
   more work hardening the slope of the blunting line is less, while the J resistance
   curve is observed to be steeper. This leads to much more potential error in estimating
   JQ, as is shown in figure 7.11. In the ASTM procedure this point is addressed by the
   requirement that the slope of the regression line at JQ is smaller than Vo.
6) The blunting line, equation (7.31), is based on J = GtVo. As was discussed in more
   detail in chapter 6, relations of the form J = MGtVo are reasonable, but the factor M
   can vary between 1 and 3, and often has a value ~2. This means that the blunting line
   slope according to the ASTM standard may be too shallow, which results in an over-

Figure 7.12. Influence of the relation between J and Gt on JQ.
7. EPFM Testing  171

   estimation of JQ, as figure 7.12 shows. Experiments have shown that the overestima-
   tion of JQ may be as much as 10%, reference 7 of the bibliography.
   It should be noted that in recent ASTM publications (e.g. reference 10) the use of a
   higher blunting line slope, obtained from experimental data, is suggested.
7) The 0.15 mm exclusion line ensures that 'a is at least 0.15 mm and so can be meas-
   ured accurately enough. The 1.5 mm exclusion line ensures that 'a is generally less
   than 6% of the remaining ligament in the SENB and CT specimens proposed for JIc
   testing, and it has been shown that up to this amount of crack extension the J integral
   formula, equation (7.26), remains valid.
8) Steps 5 and 8 of the procedure to construct figure 7.10 and the final checking criteria
   4 and 5 for JIc validity have been devised to minimise scatter and improve the reli-
   ability of the J resistance curve.

Concluding Remarks

   It should be noted that the test procedure according to ASTM standard E 813 allows
only JIc (or JQ) to be determined. There are also standardized test procedures for deter-
mining the whole J resistance curve, involving larger amounts of stable crack extension
than for the JIc determination. With the resulting curve the effect of stable crack growth
on the material's crack resistance in the elastic-plastic regime is quantified. This type of
test will not be discussed here, but the topics of J controlled crack growth and use of the
J resistance curve will be elaborated on in chapter 8.

   The JIc test procedure described in this section is restricted to cases of crack exten-
sion by means of a ductile failure mechanism (see chapter 12). However, J can also be
used to characterize the onset of brittle fracture, before or during stable crack extension.
The restrictions imposed on the amount of crack tip constraint are then much more se-
vere (see reference 9).

   It should be further noted that in 1997 the ASTM published a standard (see reference
10) that combines different types of fracture toughness measurements into a single set
of test rules. It includes the determination of KIc, JIc, J resistance curve, Gtcrit (see sec-
tion 7.6) and also critical values for J and Gt in the case of brittle fracture. The idea be-
hind this new standard is to enable fracture toughness evaluation using a single experi-
mental procedure, while minimising the risk of invalid test results because of unex-
pected material behaviour. If the evaluation of one critical fracture parameter fails it
may be possible to evaluate another parameter using the same experimental data. How-
ever, the procedure for determining JIc described in this section 7.4 is more or less cop-
ied in this recent ASTM standard, and is therefore still relevant within the context of
this course.

7.5 The KIc Specimen Size Requirement

   Although it is not really part of EPFM testing, some attention will be paid to the
evaluation of KIc for relatively tough materials. The reason is that J resistance curves
enable a somewhat different view on this subject.
172                   Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   KIc is a workable fracture criterion for higher strength, lower toughness materials, see
chapter 5, section 5.2. The specimen sizes required for a valid KIc are convenient to
handle for these materials. For lower strength, higher toughness materials KIc cannot be
measured so conveniently because the specimen size required for a valid test may be
prohibitively large. However, Landes (see reference 11) argued that the assumption that
a KIc always can be measured for any material provided that a large enough specimen is
used is not true. He showed that for some materials it is impossible to measure a valid
KIc.

   For ductile materials, i.e. materials that exhibit stable crack extension prior to failure,
the KIc is defined at the point where the stable crack extension 'a is 2% of the original
specimen crack size a. The specimen size requirement in terms of crack length is given
by

              §KIc·2                                                                (7.32)
     a t 2.5 ¨ ¸ .

              ©Vys¹

Combining this relation with 'a = 0.02·a yields

                 §KIc·2                                                             (7.33)
     'a t 0.05 ¨ ¸ ,

                 ©Vys¹

a relation which should be fulfilled to obtain a valid KIc.
   To further examine the size requirement it is convenient to write K in terms of J, us-

ing equation (6.30). For arbitrary values of J equation (7.33) can be rewritten as

                            EJ                                                      (7.34)
              'a t 0.05 2 2

                 E

As a function of the absolute amount of crack extension 'a, this relation gives the
maximum J value for which the KIc size requirement with respect to the crack length,
equation (7.32), would be fulfilled. This condition is represented by the shaded area in
the J-'a plot of figure 7.13. Also, in this figure J resistance curves are schematically
plotted for materials with a high and a low fracture toughness.

   Irrespective of specimen size, a valid KIc for a certain material can only be obtained
if for some crack extension the J resistance curve enters the shaded area. The required
specimen size then follows from equating the crack extension at which this occurs to
2% of the initial crack length. Clearly, for the tougher material KIc cannot be determined
no matter how large a specimen is used. For the material with the lower toughness, if all
other requirements are fulfilled also (see section 5.2), a valid KIc value can be deter-
mined, albeit that sometimes unrealistic specimen sizes would be required.

   For aluminium alloys and for high strength steels the KIc size requirement will be ful-
filled. However for lower strength, higher toughness steels this certainly will not be the
case: no valid KIc can be determined, regardless the specimen size.

7.6 The Standard Gtcrit Test

   At the beginning of this chapter it was remarked that the original Gtcrit test was the
subject of an official British Standard. At present the most recent version, designated
BS 7448, dates from 1991, see reference 12 of the bibliography.

The Standard COD Specimens

The standard COD test specimens conform to the three-point notched bend (SENB) and
the compact tension (CT) configurations already described in section 5.2. For CT
specimens a JIc type starter notch is allowed also (see figure 7.7). The preferred W/B ra-
tio is 2, but deviation is allowed within certain limits. In principle the thickness B must
be equal to that of the material as used in service, and the specimens are not side
grooved. Exceptions are allowed if it can be shown that a lesser thickness does not af-
fect fracture toughness or if a relation between thickness and fracture toughness can be
established.

   It is important to note that the Gtcrit values resulting from this test method may be af-
fected by the specimen geometry and size. Therefore caution is required when compar-
ing results from different sources.

Expressions for Calculating Gt
Direct measurement of Gt at the crack tip is impossible. Instead a clip gauge is used to
measure the crack opening displacement, Vg, at or near the specimen surface. It is then
assumed that the ligament b (= W  a) acts as a plastic hinge. This implies a rotation
point within the ligament at some distance r·b.
174  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

Figure 7.14. Relation between crack opening displacement Vg and crack tip opening displace-
                ment Gt.

   In figure 7.14.a an example is shown where the clip gauge is mounted on attachable
knife edges on the specimen surface. Figure 7.14.b shows that Gt can be expressed as

     Gt = r·b r·b + a + z Vg ,           (7.36)

where the distance z corrects for the use of knife edges. In general a + z should be inter-
preted as the distance between the position of the clip gauge and the crack tip. This pos-
sibly includes the size of attachable knife edges (see figure 5.5) and for CT specimens
also depends on the type of notch used.

   Although equation (7.36) is simple, there are two notable difficulties:

1) The value of the rotation factor r. Experiments show significant spread in the value
   to be used for r. This is because the determination requires complicated techniques,
   e.g. the double clip gauge method (reference 13) or infiltration of the crack with
   plastic or silicone rubber (reference 14). For the standard COD test the assigned r
   values are 0.4 for the SENB specimen and 0.46 for the CT specimen.

2) Interpretation of the clip gauge displacement Vg. The increase in Vg with loading from
   a null point setting is caused by two effects, namely elastic opening of the crack and
   rotation around r·b. Thus to consider Vg as arising only from rotation, as in equation
   (7.36), would lead to erroneous results. Instead Vg must be separated into an elastic
   part Vel and a plastic part Vpl as shown schematically in figure 7.15.

Only the plastic part of the displacement is substituted into equation (7.36), i.e.

     Gpl = Vpl·r·b r·b + a + z .         (7.37.a)

For reasons of accuracy the elastic part Vel is not used but the elastic contribution to Gt is
calculated according to the LEFM expression for CTOD, equation (3.20), modified for
plane strain and a plastic constraint factor C = 2 (see also section 3.5), i.e.
                           7. EPFM Testing       175

     Gt = Gel + Gpl = 2EVys + r·b + a + z Vpl .

   Note that the value of KI in equation (7.38) is obtained from the standard formula for
the SENB and CT specimens, equations (5.1) and (5.2), by substituting the initial crack

length, a, and the load at which Vpl is measured.
   As will be seen under the subheading "Analysis of Load-Displacement Records to

Determine Gtcrit" several values of Gtcrit can be defined. Note that the British Standard
defines Gt as the crack opening at the original crack tip, as shown in figure 6.7. This
means that it is taken for granted that during loading the crack tip will displace and
move forward owing to blunting, since at the very tip Gt must always be zero.

COD Test Procedure

The steps involved in setting up and conducting a COD test are:

1) Prepare shop drawings of the specimen.
2) Specimen manufacture.
3) Fatigue precracking.
4) Obtain test fixtures and clip gauge for crack opening displacement measurement.
5) Testing.
6) Analysis of load-displacement records to determine Gtcrit.

   Steps (1), (2) and (4) will not be considered further in view of previous discussions
in section 5.2. Steps (3) and (5) will be reviewed here and step (6) will be dealt with un-
der the next subheading.
176  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   The configuration of the starter notch for fatigue precracking is similar to that for the
standard KIc specimens, see section 5.2, except that a straight notch is recommended
rather than a chevron. Fatigue precracking has to be done with a stress ratio R (=
Vmin/Vmax) between 0 and 0.1. As was the case for JIc testing, the maximum fatigue load
should not exceed 40% of the plastic collapse load given in equations (7.27) and (7.28)
for SENB and CT specimens respectively. These requirements are to ensure a suffi-
ciently sharp precrack with limited residual plastic strain in the crack tip region.

   During the actual COD test the specimen is loaded under displacement control while
recording load and crack opening displacement. The test can be carried out with any
testing machine incorporating a load cell to measure force electrically. The British
Standard specifies that the loading rate should be such that the increase in stress inten-
sity factor with time, dKI/dt, is between 0.5 and 3.0 MPa m/s. This is arbitrarily de-
fined as `static' loading, in the same way as for KIc testing. Again note that equations
(5.1) or (5.2) may be used to calculate stress intensity factors.

   Since the increase rate dKI/dt is measured in the elastic region of the load-
displacement curve this procedure can lead to large differences in loading rate for duc-
tile specimens: if the loading rate of the testing machine is kept constant the rate of dis-
placement will strongly increase in the plastic region of the load-displacement curve; if,
on the other hand, the displacement rate of the testing machine is kept constant, the
loading rate will decrease in the plastic region. It has been shown that low loading rates
in the plastic region of the load-displacement diagram may lead to lower CTOD values,
see reference 15 of the bibliography.

   After the test the fracture surface must be examined. The procedure to determine the
fatigue precrack length and the requirements that must be met to obtain a valid test re-
sult are the same as in JIc testing, see section 7.4. Furthermore, it is necessary to estab-
lish whether stable crack extension occurred during the test and to assess the amount of
crack extension associated with possible pop-in behaviour, i.e. a small amount of unsta-
ble crack growth followed by crack arrest.

Analysis of Load-Displacement Records to Determine Gtcrit
The load-displacement records can assume six different forms. These are given schema-
tically in figure 7.16. The assessment of Gtcrit for each case will be briefly discussed.

   Before classifying the measured load-displacement curve, it is necessary to decide
whether possible pop-in behaviour must be considered significant. In all cases a pop-in
is significant if post-test examination of the fracture surface reveals that the corre-
sponding crack extension exceeded 4% of the uncracked ligament, b. Otherwise, a pop-
in is only considered significant if at subsequent crack arrest the specimen compliance
has dropped by more than 5%. A procedure for deciding this is suggested in the stan-
dard.

   Cases 1, 2 and 3 are treated similarly. Cases 1 and 2 are monotonically rising load-
displacement curves showing no or limited plasticity and no stable crack extension be-
fore fracture. Case 3 shows a (significant) pop-in owing to sudden crack extension and
7. EPFM Testing  177

arrest. In all these cases Gtcrit is taken to be Gc, which is calculated according to equation
(7.38) using Pc and Vc.

   Cases 4 and 5 may also be treated similarly. Prior to instability, which again is either

fracture or a (significant) pop-in, stable crack extension occurs. This should be revealed

after the test by examination of the fracture surface. In these cases Gtcrit is calculated as
Gu at (Pu,Vu).

   Case 6 is relevant to extremely ductile materials for which stable crack extension

proceeds beyond maximum load Pm: Gtcrit is calculated as Gm corresponding to (Pm,Vm).

 Figure 7.16. Types of load - crack opening displacement plots obtained during COD testing.

Concluding Remarks

The significance of Gtcrit is somewhat limited in practice. Materials can be classified
with it and to a certain extent Gtcrit can be used in failure assessment procedures (see
section 8.2). However, test results cannot be used to assess the effect of stable crack
growth on crack resistance. For this purpose the British Standards Institution has pub-
lished additional standards. These bear more resemblance to the JIc test procedure de-
scribed in section 7.4.

Failure Assessment
Using EPFM

8.1 Introduction

   When dealing with structures containing postulated or actual flaws, there is a need
for assessing the probability of failure. Obviously this is the case in the design phase
and at in-service inspections. However, in the possible event of failure it is also impor-
tant to reveal the cause and to determine how failure can be avoided in the future.

   As was already mentioned in section 1.3, key questions that fracture mechanics deals
with are
· what is the critical crack size for a given load or
· what is the maximum load for a given crack size?
To address these questions the concepts available in Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics
are the Crack Opening Displacement (COD) and the J integral (see chapters 6 and 7). In
this chapter these parameters are used in the following three topics:
· The COD design curve, section 8.2.
· Stable crack growth and ductile instability, described by J, section 8.3.
· Failure assessment diagrams, section 8.4.

   The very first method for assessing flawed structures under EPFM conditions was
the COD design curve, developed in the 1960s. To outline the historic development and
also because it is still in use, this approach will be briefly discussed in section 8.2.

   It can be highly conservative to ignore the effect of stable crack growth in failure as-
sessments under EPFM conditions. Therefore in section 8.3 the conditions for J-
controlled crack growth are considered briefly. Furthermore the so-called tearing
modulus is treated. This concept can be used to assess the onset of ductile instability
that may follow after a certain amount of stable crack growth, which is also often re-
ferred to as stable tearing.

   In section 8.4 an advanced method for failure assessment is discussed, based on the
failure assessment diagram. This is a two-criteria approach in which failure is consid-
ered as a process resulting from both fracture and plastic collapse. Furthermore, it al-
lows the effect of stable crack growth to be taken into account.

8.2 The COD Design Curve

   In this section the development of the COD design curve is concisely reviewed.
180  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

More details are to be found in references 1, 2 and 3 of the bibliography. The basis of
the original COD design curve is a relation between the CTOD and strains in the vicin-
ity of the crack. Using this, critical CTOD values from test specimens could be related
to maximum permissible strains near a crack with a certain size in an actual structure. In
turn these maximum strains could be compared with the actual strain in order to deter-
mine whether the crack would be critical or not.

   This approach has the disadvantage that nothing is said about how nearly critical a
crack is, nor about the maximum permissible crack size (see figure 1.4). Later, however,
critical COD values could be directly related to maximum permissible crack sizes. Nev-
ertheless, to properly understand the COD design curve it is best to first briefly consider
its historical development.

Analytical and Experimental Approach

For the COD design curve a dimensionless CTOD is introduced. This parameter, ), is
obtained by dividing Gt, by 2SVysa/E, which consists of known quantities. Thus

     ) = GtE = Gt ,                                                                       (8.1)
          2SVysa 2SHysa

where Hys = Vys/E, the elastic strain at the yield point. The numerical factor of 2S was
added to the denominator for convenience in a later stage of analysis.

Figure 8.1. Points P at a distance y above and below the centre of a crack of length 2a.

In the original approach an analytical relation was established between the strain, Hy,
between two equidistant points P across a central crack, as shown in figure 8.1. The
derivation of this relation is straightforward, although some complicated mathematics is
involved. It was based on Dugdale's strip yield model using the expression given in sec-
tion 3.3 for Gt in an infinite centre cracked plate, i.e.

     Gt = 8Vysa SE ln sec SV 2Vys .      (3.19)
8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM  181

In figure 8.2 the final result is shown, taken from reference 1. For several values of the
ratio of crack length to gauge length, a/y, the dimensionless CTOD, ), is plotted versus
the relative strain Hy/Hys.

   This is the original COD design curve, an analytical one. The intention was to pro-
vide a design curve for each a/y value such that once the critical CTOD was known
from specimen tests the maximum permissible strain in a cracked structure could be

predicted. Computation of the actual strain in the structure should then indicate whether

it were in danger of failing.

   In the late 1960s tests on wide plates were done to check the predictive capability of

the COD design curve. Measurements of critical CTOD and strain at fracture showed
that the data fell into a single scatter band with no discernible dependence on a/y. Also

   Figure 8.2. The analytical COD design curve for an infinite centre cracked plate and experi-
                  mental data from tests on wide plates, from reference 1 of the bibliography.

the strain at fracture was much larger than would have been predicted. These test results

are roughly indicated in figure 8.2.
   Obviously, there is marked disagreement between theory and experiment when Hy/Hys

exceeds 0.5, which may be explained as follows. For wide plates the relative crack
length, a/W, is small, such that as Hy/Hys approaches unity the plates undergo net section
yield and ultimately general yield. Net section yield causes the increase in CTOD to be

equal to the increase in overall displacement, and a more or less linear relation between
) and Hy/Hys, independent of a/y, has to be expected. Ultimately, in the case of general
yield, which is quite different from the assumption of a yielding strip ahead of the crack
tip, the increase in Hy/Hys becomes much larger than the increase in ).

   The problem that the analytical COD design curve is useless for Hy/Hys greater than
182                 Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

about 0.5 was obviated simply by drawing a line just above the scatter band of experi-
mental results, thereby obtaining the empirical design curve, which is also drawn in fig-
ure 8.2. In reference 2 the whole COD design curve is approximated as

          § Hy ·2        for Hy/Hys < 0.5 ,                           (8.2)

          ©Hys¹
     ) = Hy  0.25

          Hys

and so this concept has evolved to a purely empirical one, even though it has an analyti-
cal background.

The Maximum Permissible Crack Size

   Equations (8.2) still express the dimensionless COD in terms of relative strain. From
what was stated at the beginning of this section it is clearly preferable to express the
COD design curve in terms of maximum permissible crack size: this is the current COD
design curve approach due to Dawes, reference 3. He argued that for small cracks (a/W
< 0.1) and applied stresses below yield

     Hy | EV = V .                                                    (8.3)
     Hys EVys Vys

Substituting in equations (8.2) gives

          § Vy ·2 GtE                  for Vy/Vys < 0.5 ,             (8.4)
     )=¨ ¸ =                           for Vy/Vys t 0.5 .

     ) = Vy  0.25 = GtE
     Vys                 2SVysa

The maximum permissible crack size, amax, can be obtained directly from equations
(8.4) by substituting the critical COD value, Gtcrit:

     amax =  GtcritEVys                for V1/Vys < 0.5 ,             (8.5.a)

             2SV12

                    GtcritE            for 0.5 d V1/Vys < 2 .         (8.5.b)
     amax = 2S(V1  0.25Vys)

Note the designation V1. This will be explained in remark (2) below.

Remarks

1) The Dugdale approach implies (i) plane stress conditions and (ii) elastic  perfectly
   plastic material behaviour. The material is thus assumed to yield at Vys, while in re-
   ality most structural parts will yield at a somewhat higher stress level owing to work
8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM  183

   hardening and plastic constraint. This means that the actual CTOD for a crack in a

   structural part will be smaller than predicted, and higher stresses will be needed to
   reach Gtcrit. Hence the COD design curve is conservative, i.e. its use will predict
   smaller maximum permissible strains and crack sizes than those in reality.
2) In equations (8.5) the designation V1 was introduced instead of V. This is a design-
   oriented convenience: using V1 as the sum of all stress components (general and lo-
   cal) the effects of, for instance, residual stress in a weld or peak stress due to a geo-
   metrical discontinuity can be accounted for. V1 may reach values as high as twice
   Vys. More information is given in reference 2 of the bibliography to this chapter.
3) Equations (8.5) are also used for predicting the maximum permissible defect size of

   elliptical and semi-elliptical defects. This is done by calculating the LEFM stress

Figure 8.3. Correlation of COD design curve predictions of maximum permissible crack size
               with actual critical crack size for a structural steel, after reference 3 of the bibliog-
               raphy.
184  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   intensity factor for such defects, compare section 2.5. The result is set equal to K =
   V1 Sa for a through-thickness defect. From this equation an equivalent through-
   thickness crack length, a, follows and this is compared to amax in equations (8.5).
4) The British Standards Institution has published guidelines to assess the significance

   of weld defects (which are considered as elliptical flaws) based on the COD design

   curve. From service loads and measured CTOD values the tolerable defect sizes can

   be predicted. For more information the reader is referred to the official documents,
   e.g. reference 4 of the bibliography.

5) The COD design curve is generally considered to be conservative. For example from

   equation (8.5.a):

             2SV12amax 2KI2              (8.6)
     Gtcrit = EVys = EVys .

   This value of Gtcrit, is twice that obtainable from the Dugdale analysis assuming
   LEFM conditions, see equation (3.20), and so it should be expected that at least the
   lower part of the COD design curve (i.e. up to Hy/Hys = V1/Vys = 0.5) has a safety
   factor of 2. As a check on this conservatism figure 8.3 correlates COD design curve

   predictions of maximum permissible crack sizes, based on small specimen tests, with

   experimentally determined critical crack sizes in wide plates. It is seen that a safety
   factor of 2 bounds most of the data, all of which lie above the acrit/amax = 1 line.
6) Nowadays the use of the COD design curve is rather limited. In the previous remark

   it was already noted that assessments are conservative. Furthermore, the method does

   not address the effect of stable crack growth, a subject which will be discussed in the

   next section. In fact the COD design curve is now incorporated in a failure code re-

   cently published by the British Standards Institution under the designation BS 7910,

   see reference 5, as only a means for a simplified assessment. In section 8.4 a more

   advanced approach to failure assessment will be reviewed.

8.3 Stable Crack Growth and Ductile Instability described by J

   In sections 6.4 and 7.3 it was stated that the J integral concept is strictly valid only up
to the beginning of crack growth. However, J shows a well-defined rise with increasing
crack extension 'a, e.g. figure 7.5, and this has resulted in J  'a plots being referred to
as J resistance curves, or J-R curves, and to the use of a regression line for JIc testing,
figure 7.10.

   A related aspect is that it may be highly conservative (i.e. inefficient) to use JIc as a
measure of the crack resistance to be expected in practice. This is because the J-R curve

for many materials has a very steep slope, and only a few millimetres of stable crack
extension may give J values two or three times JIc. It is therefore no surprise that at-
tempts are being made to describe stable crack growth under elastic-plastic conditions.

   Depending on material behaviour, geometry and loading conditions ductile instabil-

ity may occur after a certain amount of crack growth. Obviously it is important to be
8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM                                                       185

able to predict this phenomenon.
   It should be noted that, especially in a material such as low-strength steel at relatively

low temperatures, the process of blunting and stable crack growth can also be inter-
rupted by unstable crack growth due to cleavage (see section 12.5). In the present con-
text only the more ductile behaviour, i.e. stable tearing without cleavage, will be con-
sidered.

J and Stable Crack Growth

An outline will be given of the conditions for which J can be adequately used beyond
crack initiation, i.e. J-controlled crack growth. A more thorough discussion of this sub-
ject is given in reference 6 of the bibliography.

   In section 6.5 the stresses and strains near the crack tip in a material that exhibits
power law hardening were expressed in terms of J, the so-called HRR solution. The
conditions for J-controlled crack growth are now interpreted as the ability of J to de-
scribe the crack tip fields in the presence of crack growth, at least in some annular re-
gion around the tip.

   In the J integral concept nonlinear elastic material behaviour is used to model actual
(plastic) behaviour. This is referred to as the deformation theory of plasticity. In section
6.3 it was stated that to obtain an adequate description of the material behaviour no un-
loading may occur. However, this is not the only restriction that should be imposed. The
reason is that strain hardening in a material not only depends on the amount of plastic
strain, but also on the path followed in `strain space' to arrive at this strain. Deformation
theory can describe strain hardening appropriately as long as plastic deformation is
`proportional'. This is the case if during deformation all strain increments dHij are pro-
portional to the increment in the same parameter, e.g. an infinitesimal increase in J, dJ.

   In figure 8.4 a schematic is shown of the different regions around a crack tip that has
extended by 'a in elastic-plastic material. The distance from the crack tip beyond which

186                Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

the HRR solution is no longer valid, even for a stationary crack, is denoted by R. Along
the newly formed crack flanks there is a region in which elastic unloading occurs. Fi-
nally there is a so-called process zone immediately surrounding the tip in which non-
proportional plastic loading occurs due to large geometry changes, e.g. blunting and
void formation.

   Obviously, J will be invalid in the process zone as well as in the region where un-
loading occurs. Both regions have a size of the order of 'a, and therefore a first re-
quirement for valid application of J under stable crack growth conditions must be:

     'a << R .                                                                (8.7)

   Consider some point at a distance r from the crack tip, where r < R. When a crack
extends as the result of an increasing load, and thus an increasing J value, the strain at
that point will change. This change can be attributed to the crack extension as well as to
the increase in J. It can be derived (see reference 6) that the deformation is predomi-
nantly proportional (see above) if it is mainly caused by the increase in J and only
slightly by crack extension. This condition is expressed by

     da dJ
     r << J .                                                                 (8.8)

The question whether this inequality holds for a certain r value depends entirely on ma-
terial behaviour: J must increase sufficiently during crack growth. At this stage it is
convenient to define a length quantity

     J
     D = dJ .                                                                 (8.9)
     /da

At crack initiation, i.e. J | JIc, D is roughly equal to the crack extension corresponding
to a doubling in J. As the crack extends as the result of an increase in J, which also in-
volves a decrease in dJ/da, it is obvious that D will increase.
Inequality (8.8) can now be rewritten as

     D << r .                                                                 (8.10)

   As long as D is much smaller than the size of the region in which the HRR solution
is valid, i.e.

     D << R ,                                                                 (8.11)

then there will be some annular region surrounding the crack tip, defined by

     D << r < R ,                                                             (8.12)

in which inequality (8.8) holds and thus deformation is approximately proportional.
   Summarising, J can be used to describe crack growth if (i) the crack extension is

limited, cf. equation (8.7), and (ii) if a region exists in which strain is mainly determined
        8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM          187

by the increase in J rather than by crack extension, cf. equation (8.11). These conditions
for J-controlled crack growth can also be expressed somewhat more quantitatively. For
this it is convenient to consider R as being some fraction of the uncracked ligament b (=
W  a). Equations (8.7) and (8.11) may then be rewritten as

                     'a                           (8.13)
     'a << b or b = D << 1 ,                      (8.14)

and

     b                        dJ b
     D << b or D >> 1 and thus da · J = Z >> 1 .

Based on both experimental and analytical studies using bend type geometries, i.e.
SENB and CT specimens, a maximum D value of 0.06 - 0.10 and a minimum Z value of
10 is suggested by Shih et al. (reference 7). However, they also found that for tensile
type geometries, e.g. CCT specimens, these limit values are 0.01 and 80 for D and Z re-
spectively. Thus it seems that the range over which J controls crack growth is geometry-
dependent.

   More recently this geometry dependence has been attributed to the fact that stresses
and strains near the crack tip are not in all cases accurately described by the HRR solu-
tion, see reference 8. Differences arise from the development of so-called in-plane con-
straint around a growing crack (see also under the subheading "Applicability of the
Tearing Modulus" in this section).

   The general tendency is that in the case of bending loads, large specimens and/or a
high degree of strain hardening, crack growth will be mainly J-controlled.

Ductile Instability

The first notable attempt to describe ductile instability under elastic-plastic conditions is
the tearing modulus concept developed by Paris et al.1, reference 9. This concept, which
will be treated in some detail here, is based on the elastic-plastic analogue of the R-
curve concept in LEFM. In this case of J-controlled crack growth we must therefore
distinguish between the applied J value on the one hand and the material's resistance to
crack growth on the other.

   If a structural component containing a crack is loaded, a certain value of J is applied
which can be considered as the `crack driving force'. For a certain geometry this J
value, which will be denoted as Japp, depends on the load level and the crack length. For
a limited number of geometries Japp values can be calculated analytically. Otherwise
numerical methods, such as the finite element method, must be used.

   On the other hand, as is schematically shown in figure 8.5, the J-R curve represents
the material's crack resistance as a function of crack extension. This crack resistance in
terms of J, denoted as Jmat, is assumed to be independent of the initial crack length.

1 P.C. Paris is generally credited with developing the tearing modulus concept. However, J.R. Rice and
   J.W. Hutchinson have made important contributions, as Paris acknowledges in his publications on the
   subject.
188  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

Figure 8.5. A schematic JR curve, i.e. Jmat versus crack extension.

   In figure 8.6 calculated values for Japp as a function of crack length at discrete load
levels P1 to P4 are schematically represented by solid lines. Since Jmat is independent of
the initial crack length, the crack initiation and stable crack growth behaviour of a com-
ponent containing a crack of length ao can be studied by inserting the material's J-R
curve in figure 8.6, starting at this initial crack length ao.

   Assume that in figure 8.6 initiation of crack growth occurs at load level P3. By in-
creasing the load, stable tearing takes place as long as there is equilibrium in the sense
that

     Japp(P,a) = Jmat('a) .                                             (8.15)

Analogous to the LEFM R-curve, tearing will become unstable as soon as

Figure 8.6. The crack driving force diagram.

wJapp > dJmat .                                      (8.16)
 wa da

From figure 8.6 it can be seen that at this point the load has increased to P4, while the
amount of stable ductile tearing can be assessed also. This type of graph is referred to as
a `crack driving force diagram', see reference 7.

The Tearing Modulus Concept

A serious drawback of the approach adopted in figure 8.6 is its lack of accuracy: the J
value at instability and the amount of crack extension have to be obtained from a graph.
Paris formulated the criterion for ductile instability, equation (8.16), as

Tapp > Tmat ,                                        (8.17)

using the non-dimensional quantities

E wJapp                               E dJmat        (8.18)
Tapp = V2 wa and Tmat = V2 da ,
o                                     o

which he termed the applied and the material tearing modulus respectively. As before,
Vo is the flow stress equal to the average of the yield strength Vys and the ultimate ten-
sile strength Vuts.

   The material tearing modulus, Tmat, is completely determined by material properties,
i.e. the slope of the J-R curve, the Young's modulus and the flow stress, and is therefore

unique for a given material and fully describes its (J-controlled) tearing behaviour.

   Paris also chose the non-dimensional formulation of equation (8.18), because he

found that the material tearing modulus Tmat depends less on temperature than the slope
of the J-R curve, dJmat/da, does. Furthermore, for a limited number of idealized configu-
rations ductile instability can be analytically assessed, leading to expressions that con-

tain the definition of Tmat.

    An approximate analysis of ductile instability for a centre cracked plate under plastic limit load is
given here as an illustration (taken from reference 9). Consider figure 8.7 in which a plate-shaped speci-
men is shown with width, W, length, L and thickness, B, containing a central crack with length, 2a. It is
assumed that material behaviour is elastic  perfectly plastic and that the ligaments adjacent to the crack
have become fully plastic. For this case the specimen load is equal to the plastic limit load, PL, and is
given by

PL = Vo(W  2a)B .                                    (8.19)

    Owing to the load the length of the specimen, L, increases by 'L. This specimen lengthening can be
divided into an elastic part

        PLL                                          (8.20)
'Lel = BWE

and a plastic part, 'Lpl. The plastic part is caused solely by the presence of the crack and is therefore ap-
proximated by the crack tip opening displacement, Gt. Using equation (6.34), Gt can be related to J, lead-
ing to

'Lpl = Gt = JV .o                                    (8.21)
190                    Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

Figure 8.7. Centre cracked plate under limit load.

    If J is sufficiently high, an increase dJ will involve the extension of each crack tip over a distance da.
Note that the material's tearing behaviour determines the relation between dJ and da.

    Increasing J by dJ implies an increase in plastic lengthening

     d('Lpl) = dJV ,o                                                              (8.22)

while at the same time a crack extension, da, causes a change in the (limit) load

     dPL = 2VoBda ,                                                                (8.23)

leading to a decrease in elastic lengthening, i.e.

                dPLL 2VoL                                                          (8.24)
     d('Lel) = BWE =  WE da .

    Assume that the specimen is loaded under fixed grip conditions, i.e. the crack extends while the total

specimen lengthening, 'L, remains constant. Instability will now occur as soon as the elastic shortening,
i.e. d('Lel), is larger than the plastic lengthening. Thus, using equations (8.22) and (8.24), the instability
criterion reads

     2VoLda > dJ .                                                                 (8.25)
     WE Vo

After rearranging this criterion to

     2L E dJ                                                                       (8.26)
     W > V2 da ,

                o

it can directly be compared with equation (8.17), i.e. Tapp > Tmat.
    The applied tearing modulus for the specific case considered here turns out to depend on geometrical

quantities only. The tendency is that tearing instability will occur sooner, i.e. at a lower amount of crack
growth, if the specimen has a high length to width ratio. This seems reasonable in view of the higher
amount of elastic energy stored in the specimen.

Applicability of the Tearing Modulus
Within the validity range of J-controlled crack growth, the tearing modulus concept
should be capable of predicting ductile instability. It requires the calculation of Tapp for

a certain structural component and experimental data on Tmat for the component mate-
rial. However, its usefulness in practice must still be considered.

   First it must be noted that criteria for initiation of crack extension, based on the K, G,
J or COD concept, are based only on stress, crack length and a single material parame-
ter. In general, no further information is needed for predicting initiation of fracture in a
component or structure.

   In contrast with this, predicting ductile instability is very complex. Firstly, the ap-
plied tearing modulus, Tapp, not only depends on crack length and the load level, but
also on quantities such as specimen geometry, flow stress and strain hardening charac-
teristics of the material. In reference 10 of the bibliography Japp  crack length a solu-
tions are presented for a number of standard geometries. Material properties such as E,
Vo and strain hardening exponent n (cf. equation (6.32)) have to be substituted to obtain
the Japp  a curve for a cracked component of a specific material under a given load. For
other geometries calculations are required which relate to that specific case and thus
have no general validity.

   Secondly, for most materials, the slope of the J-R curve becomes less steep with in-
creasing crack extension. This means that Tmat is not a constant material parameter.
Furthermore the J-R curve is found to depend strongly on the state of stress near the
crack tip or, more specifically, on the constraint in the thickness direction (i.e. plane
strain, plane stress), but also on the in-plane constraint. Numerical analyses show that
the in-plane constraint around a growing crack depends strongly on specimen geometry
and type of loading: for example, a deeply cracked SENB specimen shows a signifi-
cantly larger amount of in-plane constraint than a CCT specimen.

    To understand why the J-R curve and thus the process of ductile crack growth is affected by the
amount of constraint, one needs to consider the hydrostatic stress component, Vh, defined as the average
of the principle stresses, i.e.

Vh = 31 (V1 + V2 + V3) .          (8.27)

This hydrostatic stress component is responsible for the nucleation and growth of voids, which is an es-
sential step in the ductile tearing mechanism (see chapter 12). Since constraint determines the magnitude
of Vh, dJ/da for a given material can be expected to be affected also.

   Evidently, the practical use of the tearing modulus concept is subject to many re-
strictions.

8.4 The Failure Assessment Diagram: CEGB R6 Procedure

   Accurate failure assessments in an elastic-plastic context cannot be solely based on
fracture mechanics concepts but should also consider effects of plastic deformation. In
fact the Feddersen approach discussed in section 5.3 is an example in which the effect
of (contained) yield on failure is already considered.

   During the last decades considerable effort has been put into the development of a
procedure that is able to deal with more widespread plasticity and the interaction with
fracture. This procedure is focused around a two-criteria approach which was originally
192                              Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

introduced in 1975 by Dowling and Townley, see reference 11. In 1976 the Central
Electricity Generating Board in the UK (CEGB) published the first procedure for failure
assessment using the two-criteria approach. It has gained widespread attention and is
used in various countries.

   Since the first publication numerous changes have been implemented. Here revision
3 of what is commonly referred to as the R6 procedure will be treated, see reference 12.
Note that roughly the same procedure is adopted by the British Standards Institution and
issued as a standard, see reference 5.

Principle

The load carrying capacity of a flawed structure is limited by two criteria. First of all the
linear elastic stress intensity factor KI must not be greater than the fracture toughness. In
the notation of the R6 procedure this is expressed in terms of the dimensionless pa-
rameter Kr, i.e.

             Kr = KI Kmat d 1 .                                                                (8.28)

Here Kmat is a fracture toughness value whose precise definition depends on the type of
analysis, as will be discussed later.

   The second criterion is that the applied load that actually contributes to plastic col-

lapse must not be larger than the plastic collapse load of the flawed structure. To ex-
press this criterion the parameter Lr is introduced, which describes the proximity to
plastic yielding of the structure, i.e.

                  applied load that contributes to plastic collapse max                        (8.29)
             Lr = plastic yield load of the flawed structure d Lr .

Note that the load needed for plastic yield is used and not that for plastic collapse. These

loads will be discussed further under the subheading "Evaluation of Kr and Lr".

The   value  of  Lmax     depends  on  the   plastic  behaviour  of  the  material  and  more  specifi-

                   r

cally on the amount of strain hardening, i.e.

              max Vo                                                                           (8.30)
             Lr = ,

                     Vys

where Vo is again the flow stress, equal to the average of the yield strength, Vys, and the

ultimate tensile strength, Vuts. For ideal plastic (i.e. non-hardening) material behaviour

Lmax  would  be  1,  but  in  general  Lmax  is  somewhat  larger  than   1.

  r                                      r

The criteria (8.28) and (8.29) represent two distinct failure mechanisms. However,

some interaction between the mechanisms is to be expected and is included in the R6

procedure by replacing the inequality in equation (8.28) by

             Kr d f(Lr) .                                                                      (8.31)

The criteria represented by inequalities (8.29) and (8.31) may be represented by a
8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM  193

   Figure 8.8. A Failure Assessment Diagram.

Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) as depicted in figure 8.8. If the point (Lr, Kr)
calculated for the cracked body at extreme loading conditions lies within the region
bounded by equations (8.29) and (8.31), it is considered safe.

   In the first version of the R6 procedure the limiting curve of the FAD was based on
Dugdale's strip yield model (see chapter 3). Work hardening was incorporated implic-
itly by using an alternative definition of Lr (then still called Sr). Instead of the plastic
yield load being used, as in equation (8.29), the plastic limit load was chosen, which is a
quantity based on the flow stress acting on the net section. At the same time Lr was lim-
ited to 1. Although this is satisfactory for most structural steels, this is not the case for
materials like austenitic steels, which show a low initial rate of, and a high capacity for
work hardening. The need arose to explicitly incorporate the details of the material's
stress-strain behaviour.

   Revision 3 of the R6 procedure uses the J integral to calculate Kr, an idea originally
introduced by Bloom, reference 13, and Shih et al., reference 14. The method developed
is based on the explicit formulation of J given in reference 10.

Failure Assessment Curve

In the R6 procedure three options are given for establishing a failure assessment curve.
These options require an increasing amount of material data and effort, but the results
are increasingly accurate (less conservative). For convenience, these options will be
treated in reversed order.
· Option 3: J integral analysis

   In this option an assessment curve is obtained that is specific for the material and the
   geometry considered. Stress analyses must be performed for the cracked structure,
   for example using the finite element method, and values for the J integral should be
   evaluated. For an appropriate range of Lr values (and thus load values) both elastic
   and elastic-plastic analyses should be performed, resulting in Je and J values respec-
   tively.
194                  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

     The failure assessment curve for this option is     (8.32)
                          Je

            f3(Lr) = J ,

where J and Je are evaluated for equal values of Lr. Clearly, for low Lr values the as-
sessment curve will be almost equal to 1, while at higher values the value can be ex-
pected to drop.

   In the actual assessment the following definition is used:

     Kr = Je Jmat ,                                      (8.33)

   where Jmat depends on the type of analysis (see below). By combining equations
   (8.32) and (8.33), it can be seen that in fact the assessment is based on the criterion J
   d Jmat. The advantage in using the assessment curve lies in the fact that once this
   curve is established for the geometry and material under consideration, the actual as-
   sessment is based on Je, for which only an elastic calculation needs to be performed.

       Although the Option 3 assessment curve requires a J analysis of the cracked
   structure, it has the potential for greater accuracy than the approximate curves of
   Options 2 and 1.
· Option 2: Approximate J integral analysis
   As stated before, reference 10 gives J integral solutions for standard geometries.
   These require the material stress-strain behaviour to be described in terms of the
   Ramberg-Osgood relation, equation (6.32). However, not all materials are well de-
   scribed by this relation. For this reason Ainsworth (reference 15) reformulated the J
   solutions in such a way that the actual stress-strain relation of the material could be
   used. In combination with equation (8.32) he obtained the assessment curve

     §E Href         2 1/2
                     Lr ·
     f(Lr) = ¨ +     2¸ .                                (8.34)
     © Vref 2(1 + Lr)¹

In this expression a so-called reference stress, Vref, is introduced. This stress is de-
fined such that the ratio of Vref to Vys is equal to Lr, i.e. Vref = LrVys. From the refer-
ence stress a reference strain, Href, is obtained using the material's true stress-strain
curve.

   In the case where the structure behaves elastically the first term in equation (8.34)
is equal to 1, and since Lr << 1 the second term is negligible. On the other hand, for
fully plastic behaviour the first term is much larger than 1, while the second term still
remains smaller than 1. Therefore in these two extreme cases f(Lr) is determined only
by the first term in equation (8.34). For the intermediate case where only small-scale
yielding occurs, the bulk behaviour of the structure is still elastic, i.e. EHref | Vref.
The fact that J now already exceeds its elastic value must be reflected in a value for
f(Lr) somewhat lower than 1. The second term in equation (8.34) accounts for this

correction.
                           8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM                                    195

   To diminish the correction of the second term in the case of fully plastic behav-
iour the denominator includes the term (1 + L2r). However, it was found that this di-
minishing effect is not in all cases satisfactory, since it is based on Lr. It should be

based on the extent to which the structure behaves fully plastically, which is de-
scribed by EHref/Vref. Substituting this term for (1 + L2r) in equation (8.34) leads to the
failure assessment curve for Option 2:

                                3 1/2

                § E Href Lr Vys·

                     ©Lr Vys 2E Href¹

       Using the Option 2 assessment curve avoids the necessity of a full J analysis.
   However, it still requires full knowledge of the (true) stress-strain curve of the mate-
   rial.
· Option 1: General failure assessment curve
   The Option 1 curve is derived as an empirical fit to the Option 2 curves for several
   commonly used materials, but biased towards the lower bound. The result of this fit
   is:

           f1(Lr) = (1  0.14 L2r){0.3 + 0.7 exp(0.65 L6r)} .                                   (8.36)

This curve is plotted in Figure 8.9. Note that this curve needs no material data apart

from  Vys  and  the  flow  stress,  Vo.  These  are  used  to  calculate  Lmax  according  to  equa-

                                                                            r

tion (8.29). Typical values for some steel categories are indicated in figure 8.9.

For materials that show a discontinuous yield point, as is the case for a number of

structural steels, the use of the Option 1 curve should be restricted to Lr d 1. The Op-

196  Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

tion 2 curve for these materials predicts a sharp drop near Lr = 1, which is not de-
scribed by equation (8.36).

   Obviously, the Option 1 assessment curve requires the least amount of material
data and effort, but also leads to the most conservative failure assessment.

Evaluation of Kr and Lr

Before the assessment parameters Kr and Lr can be evaluated, stress analyses must be
performed. For Options 1 or 2 an elastic analysis of the uncracked structure suffices,
using any suitable method that yields the stresses in the region of the defect. As stated
before, Option 3 requires both an elastic and elastic-plastic stress analysis of the cracked
structure.

   It is important to categorize the loads or resulting stresses with respect to their nature.
A distinction must be made between
· primary stresses, Vp, defined as those stresses arising from loads which actually

   contribute to plastic collapse, such as pressure, dead-weight or interaction with other
   components,
· secondary stresses, Vs, which are self-equilibrating stresses not contributing to plas-
   tic collapse and caused by, for example, local thermal gradients or welding.

   In view of the definition of Lr, equation (8.29), it is obvious that secondary stresses
need not be considered to evaluate Lr, i.e.

            applied load giving rise to Vp stresses     (8.37)
     Lr = plastic yield load of the flawed structure .

The definition of the plastic yield load also depends on the nature of the defect. For
through-thickness cracks this is the global yield load, which can be determined as the
limit load for the structure assuming no work hardening. For part-through cracks the
yield load is the load needed for plasticity to spread across the remaining ligament,
again without accounting for work hardening. The R6 procedure gives several examples
of, and references to, plastic yield load solutions.

   Although secondary stresses are not relevant when calculating Lr, they do contribute
to Kr. Since this contribution is not straightforward it will be concisely reviewed here.

   In the elastic range the stress intensity caused by secondary stresses, KIs, can simply
be added to that caused by primary stresses, KIp. However, due to crack tip plasticity this
superposition will be an underestimate when stress levels become higher.2 Ultimately, if
the structure shows significant plasticity due to high primary stresses, the effect of sec-
ondary stresses will again become small. To account for this interaction of primary and
secondary stresses a shift, U, is applied to the definition of Kr in equation (8.28), i.e.:

2 Although the R6 procedure is primarily intended for elastic-plastic cases, the fact that a straightforward

   superposition is an underestimate can also be understood by considering the LEFM correction for
   crack tip plasticity suggested by Irwin. From equation (3.7) it is easily verified that KI(V1 + V2) >
   KI(V1) + KI(V2).
                     8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM  197

       Kr = KI Kmat + U ,                              (8.38)

where KI = KIp + KIs.
   The value of the shift depends on the magnitude of both primary and secondary

stresses. Based on finite element analyses the R6 procedure gives values for U depend-
ing on the magnitude of the primary stresses relative to the yield strength, expressed by
the value for Lr:

· Lr d 0.8
   The shift U is equal to U1, a value which is independent of Lr, but is a function of a
   parameter F according to

       U1 = 0.1F0.714  0.007F2 + 0.00003F5 ,           (8.39)

where

            KIs                                        (8.40)
       F = KIp Lr .

   The parameter F can be considered a measure for the level of the secondary stresses
   relative to the yield strength.3
· 0.8 < Lr d 1.05
   For increasing primary loads the shift is decreased linearly to zero according to

       U = 4U1 (1.05  Lr) .                            (8.41)

· 1.05 < Lr
   The shift U is set to zero. This is a conservative estimate since finite element analyses
   suggest negative values for U in this Lr range.

   Note that for high levels of secondary stresses, i.e. for F > 4, the approach described
here may lead to a significant overestimation of the effect of secondary stresses, because
of plastic relaxation of peak elastic stresses that exceed the yield stress. However, to ac-
count for this an elastic-plastic analysis is required. Such an analysis is also required
when only secondary stresses are present.

   The evaluation of Kr also requires a value for Kmat to be set. This, however, depends
on the type of analysis that is chosen and will be treated under the subheading "Types of
Analyses".

Flaw Characterisation

Generally, the geometry of flaws will not allow a straightforward analysis and some
simplifications must be made. This process, termed flaw characterisation, should be per-
formed with care since it must lead to conservative results. The following aspects need
to be considered:

3 Equation (8.40) suggests a dependency of F (and thus of U1) on Lr. However, this is only seemingly so
   since KIp increases proportionally with Lr.
198          Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

· Orientation
   Arbitrarily shaped flaws are represented by equivalent planar crack-like defects. A
   flaw is projected on a plane either:

   1) through its principal plane,
   2) normal to the direction of the maximum principal stress or
   3) normal to the surface and parallel to the principal axis of the flaw.

   Note that only in the second case a pure mode I situation is obtained.
· Shape

   A distinction is made between through-thickness defects, semi-elliptical surface de-
   fects and elliptical embedded defects. If the assessment indicates ligament failure for
   either an embedded or a surface defect it may be re-characterised as a surface defect
   or a through-thickness defect, respectively.
· Interaction
   The interaction between a defect and a neighbouring defect or a free surface can be
   accounted for by assuming the ligaments to be part of the defect. If this does not
   yield satisfactory results, one may use the more extensive interaction criteria given in
   the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code of the American Society of Mechanical Engi-
   neers (ASME), Section XI (see reference 16) or the British Standards Institution
   (BSI) Published Document 6493 (see reference 4). As a last resort, the calculation of
   Kr can be based on appropriate KI solutions, if available, while Lr follows from the
   procedure already briefly described under the subheading "Evaluation of Kr and Lr".

Types of Analyses

In the R6 procedure three analysis categories are defined:

· Analysis against Crack Initiation Criteria (Category 1)
   This type of analysis is appropriate when failure is either brittle or is preceded by
   only a limited amount of ductile tearing. It can also be used when the material shows
   significant ductile tearing prior to failure, but then the increase in toughness involved
   in crack growth cannot be taken into account. This can, however, be advantageous in
   view of the relative simplicity of this type of analysis.
       In LEFM cracks are assumed to initiate when KI > KIc. If a valid KIc value can be
   determined for the material, for example using the test method given in ASTM stan-
   dard E 399, Kmat in equations (8.28) or (8.38) is equal to KIc. If no valid KIc can be
   obtained but the slope of the load-displacement test record does not deviate more
   than 5% from the initial value, the conditional KIc value, KQ, may be used for Kmat.
       If the nonlinearity of the load-displacement test record is larger, indicating signifi-
   cant plastic deformation, Kmat must be determined using the J integral. If the total
   crack extension prior to failure, 'a, which is defined as the sum of crack tip blunting
   and stable tearing, is less than 0.2 mm, then

     Kmat =    EJ                                (8.42)
             1  Q2 ,
                                 8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM                    199

where J is evaluated at failure. When the total crack extension is larger, J in equation
(8.42) is evaluated at 'a = 0.2 mm. This is done by constructing a J-'a regression
line more or less similar to that used for the JIc determination according to ASTM
standard E 813. Note, however, that the R6 procedure is different, in the sense that
no distinction is made between blunting and actual crack growth.

Figure 8.10. FAD for a category 1 analysis against crack initiation (reference 12).

       The calculated Kr and Lr values represent a point in the FAD. For the condition
   represented by point A in figure 8.10 crack initiation will not occur, since this point
   lies on the safe side of the assessment line. Crack initiation can occur as a result of
   changes in one or more parameters affecting the assessment. Such changes can be
   represented on the FAD by the loci of points. For example, the line AB represents a
   decrease of the initiation toughness for the material, and the line AC shows what
   happens if the load applied to the structure is increased. Since points B and C lie on
   the assessment curve, they represent different limiting conditions for the avoidance
   of crack initiation.
· Ductile Tearing Analysis (Categories 2 and 3)
   If the assessment point of a Category 1 analysis lies outside the safe region of the
   FAD, this does not always indicate a failure condition. For materials that exhibit sta-
   ble crack growth by ductile tearing, the fracture toughness increases with crack
   growth. As already expressed in equations (8.15) and (8.16), the crack will remain
   stable as long as

          Japp d Jmat                                                                (8.43.a)
and                                                                                  (8.43.b)

          wJapp wa d dJmat da .

   A Category 3 ductile tearing analysis is performed by calculating Lr and Kr for a
range of postulated crack extensions, 'a, starting from the initial crack length ao. In
200                     Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

the calculation of Kr, according to equation (8.38), Kmat is derived from the mate-
rial's J resistance (J-R) curve for a crack growth increment 'a. As a result of crack
extension both KI (or Japp) and Kmat (or Jmat) will increase. However, as long as
inequality (8.43.b) holds, Kr will decrease. At the same time Lr will increase some-
what as a result of crack growth, so in the FAD the locus of assessment points will be
directed roughly downwards from the point corresponding to the initial crack length
ao.

   Figure 8.11 gives an example of a Category 3 assessment. For equal initial crack
lengths assessment curves AB and CD are calculated at a load P1 and a much higher
load P2, respectively. Curve AB lies entirely below the assessment curve and so no
cracking will occur at load level P1. Curve CD is first above and then tangent to the
assessment curve. This means that load level P2 is the limiting load for this analysis,
since for any load smaller than P2 the assessment points would eventually drop be-
low the assessment curve as a result of ductile tearing and thus crack growth would
stop.

     Figure 8.11. FAD for a category 3 ductile tearing analysis (reference 12).

   To be able to actually assess the tangency condition, it is imperative that the J re-
sistance data for the material, i.e. the J-R curve, extends over a sufficiently large
crack extension range. Very often such data are not available due to the limited di-
mensions of the test specimens used for determining the J-R curve. Specimen dimen-
sions restrict the maximum allowable J value to the smaller of

                   bVo                                                           (8.44.a)
          Jmax = 25                                                              (8.44.b)
and

                   BVo
          Jmax = 25 ,

cf. equation (7.30). Furthermore, crack growth must be J-controlled in order for an
8. Failure Assessment Using EPFM                                  201

experimentally determined J-R curve to be applicable to an actual structure. For this
reason the maximum amount of crack growth, 'amax, is related to the ligament size,
cf. equation (8.13). In the R6 procedure

'amax = 0.06(W  ao) + 0.2 .                                       (8.45)

At the same time it is required that

     b dJ                                                         (8.46)
Z = J · da > 10 ,

cf. equation (8.14).4 Note that if the onset of instability cannot be assessed, the lim-
iting load resulting from a Category 3 analysis will be lower.

   A Category 2 analysis requires less effort, while still providing a safeguard
against instability. In a Category 2 analysis Lr and Kr are evaluated only for two
crack lengths, i.e. at the initial size ao and at the size after a certain amount of crack
growth, ao+'ag. The crack growth 'ag is the validity limit for the J-R test imposed
by either the maximum allowable J value or the maximum crack growth.

   Both the Category 2 and 3 analyses consider ductile tearing due to a certain load.
It is assumed that no form of subcritical crack growth is involved during this tearing,
e.g. fatigue crack growth or sustained load fracture (see chapters 9 and 10 respec-
tively). If these crack growth mechanisms cannot be excluded, Category 2 or 3
analyses should only be applied to overload conditions. (Obviously subcritical crack
growth under normal loading should be taken into account to estimate the crack size
after a certain service time.)

Significance of Analysis Results

In practice it is not sufficient to define a limiting condition, e.g. a critical crack size or a
maximum load. It is important to obtain insight into the sensitivity of the result to
variations in input parameters, such as material data, loads and/or crack sizes. To do this
it is convenient to define reserve factors with respect to these parameters.

   An important reserve factor is that with respect to the load, FL, which is defined as

FL = Load actually applied Load producing a limiting condition .  (8.47)

The load producing a limiting condition corresponds to an assessment point (Lr, Kr) ly-
ing on the failure assessment curve. In the absence of secondary stresses FL simply fol-

lows from scaling the actual assessment point along a line from the origin in the failure
assessment diagram. Referring to figure 8.10, the reserve factor FL = OC/OA. In the
case where both primary and secondary stresses are present the R6 procedure gives a

graphical procedure to account for the interaction between these two types of stress.

4 Under certain conditions the limits for J-controlled growth can be relaxed. This is the case if tests show
   that specimen size is not relevant for the J-R curve or if the cross-section of the structure is thin and the
   test specimens have the same thickness.
202                                      Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics

   For example, the reserve factors on crack size, Fa, and on fracture toughness, FK, are

                 Fa = Actual crack size Crack size producing limiting condition ,                                        (8.48)

                 FK = Fracture toughness producing limiting condition Material fracture toughness .                      (8.49)

   The minimum values for the relevant reserve factors needed to establish whether a
loading condition is acceptable follow from sensitivity analyses. In such analyses the
sensitivity of reserve factors to variations in load, secondary stresses, crack size, mate-
rial properties, etc. are evaluated. As an example, figure 8.12 schematically shows a pre-
ferred and a non-preferred variation of FL with crack length. In the non-preferred situa-
tion FL would most probably be required to be higher than 1.4 in order to reliably avoid
the limiting condition. Obviously the range of uncertainty in the parameter under con-
sideration should also be taken into account.

   Figure 8.12. Preferred (left) and non-preferred (right) variation of load reserve factor with crack
                   length (reference 12).

   For a Category 2 analysis a specific sensitivity analysis is suggested in the R6 procedure. Two load re-

serve  factors,    L  and  FLg,   are  evaluated:

                 Fo

·    L  at  the  initiation   of  crack  growth,   i.e.  at  crack  length  ao  and  the  initial  fracture  toughness,

   Fo

·       after  'ag  of   ductile  crack  growth,   i.e.  at  crack  length  ao+'ag      and  an  increased   fracture  toughness.
   Fg

Since for a Category 2 analysis the acceptance of the loading condition generally relies on the increase in

fracture  toughness      caused   by   ductile  tearing,       L  will  be  relatively  small  and  probably  smaller    than  1.  To

ensure that FL increases sufficiently during ductile tearing, it is required that

                   L                                                                                                     (8.50.a)

Furthermore, at the validity limit of crack extension, 'ag, the load reserve factor should have a certain
minimum value, i.e.

Fatigue Crack
Growth

9.1 Introduction
   In the middle of the nineteenth century failures were observed in bridges and railway

components that were subjected to repeated loading. Because the loading was such that
statically it would pose no problem, it was accepted very soon that the failures were a
consequence of the cyclic nature of the loading. A complicating factor was that most
failures occurred without any obvious warning. The problem was defined as metal fa-
tigue, which was considered as a fracture phenomenon caused by repeated or cyclic
loading. A rigorous definition of metal fatigue is difficult. In reference 1 it is defined as:
"Failure of a metal under a repeated or otherwise varying load which never reaches a
level sufficient to cause failure in a single application".

   In 1860 Wöhler, a German railway engineer, proposed a method by which failure of

   Figure 9.1. Schematic representation of the fatigue life and its dependence on stress levels.
208  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

cyclically loaded components could be avoided. Figure 9.1 shows a so-called Wöhler
curve, which gives the fatigue lifetime as a function of the applied alternating stress
range.1 Wöhler found that by limiting the alternating stress range to a certain level the
life of the load bearing components would become virtually infinite. This safe level was
called the fatigue limit stress range2 and was considered a material property provided
some special precautions were taken.

   At the beginning of the 20th century it became increasingly clear that fatigue failure
is a progressive and localized process, involving both initiation of a crack and its growth
until instability. However, this was not generally accepted. For a long time fatigue was
considered as a gradual deterioration of a material subjected to repeated loads. A con-
siderable confusion about the nature of fatigue resulted. This changed around 1950
when a considerable interest in the initiation and growth of fatigue cracks arose. This
interest was stimulated by the understanding that the fatigue lifetime of a cyclically
loaded structure comprises stages of both crack initiation and propagation, as is also in-
dicated in figure 9.1.

   In the context of this fracture mechanics course the division into microcrack and
macrocrack (or long crack) growth periods is of basic importance. This division can be
defined in various ways. An apparently very reasonable definition is that a macrocrack
has dimensions sufficient for its growth to depend only on bulk properties and condi-
tions rather than on local ones. In LEFM terms this means that macrocrack growth can
be described by the stress intensity factor concept. The merits of this approach will be
discussed in section 9.2.

   As in the case of statically loaded cracks, there are plastic zones at the tips of propa-
gating fatigue cracks. These plastic zones have a significant effect on crack growth, to
be discussed in section 9.3. Another important influence is the effect of the environ-
ment. An overview of environmental effects on fatigue crack growth is given in section
9.4. However, the effects of material microstructure are not fully dealt with in this
chapter. Instead they form part of chapter 13, sections 13.3 and 13.4.

   Sections 9.2  9.4 are concerned with the straightforward application of linear elastic
fracture mechanics to fatigue crack growth. In section 9.5 this application is extended to
predicting crack growth under constant amplitude loading. In sections 9.6 and 9.7 fa-
tigue crack propagation under variable amplitude loading and methods for its prediction
are discussed.

   The initiation and growth of microcracks as a result of fatigue loading is an impor-
tant issue because these phases generally represent a major part of the total fatigue life-
time and also because knowledge of these phases is essential if one aims to prevent fa-
tigue damage to occur at all. In section 9.8 the relation between the fatigue limit stress
range and the threshold stress intensity range is considered. Furthermore, the growth of
microcracks (small compared to the notch dimensions) from the roots of notches will be

1 This is also frequently referred to as an S/N curve.
2 In the literature the term `fatigue limit' is often used, which is half the stress range at the fatigue limit,

   i.e. the amplitude of the alternating stress at the fatigue limit.
9. Fatigue Crack Growth                            209

treated briefly. Finally, an engineering approach to the effect of defects on the fatigue
limit is discussed.

9.2 Description of Fatigue Crack Growth Using the Stress Intensity
       Factor

   A very important advance in metal fatigue during the past decades is the general un-
derstanding that structures can contain crack-like defects that are either introduced dur-
ing manufacturing, especially in case of welding, or form early during service. Virtually
the whole life of some structures can be occupied by fatigue crack growth from flaws.
Despite the fact that cyclic loading can change the deformation response of a metal and
its microstructure, leading to fatigue crack initiation, it is now generally accepted that in
engineering terms fatigue damage is best dealt with by a combination of `traditional'
lifing approaches (fatigue initiation) and lifing based on fatigue crack growth. Know-
ledge about fatigue crack growth is essential for the understanding and prediction of fa-
tigue behaviour of many structures.

   The main question concerning fatigue crack growth is: how long does it take for a
crack to grow from a certain initial size to the maximum permissible size, i.e. the crack
size at which failure of a component or structure is just avoidable. This is one of the five
basic questions posed in section 1.3. There are three aspects to this question:

· the initial crack size, ad,
· the maximum permissible or critical crack size, acr,
· the period of crack growth between ad and acr.

   The initial crack size, ad, corresponds to the minimum size that can be reliably de-
tected using non-destructive inspection (NDI) techniques, or it corresponds to a crack
size that cannot be detected but is assumed to be present. Secondly, the maximum per-
missible crack size, acr, can be determined, at least in principle, using LEFM or EPFM
analysis to predict the onset of unstable crack extension. The third aspect requires
knowledge of a fatigue crack growth curve, schematically shown in figure 9.2. Note that

Figure 9.2. Schematic fatigue crack growth curve.
210  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

there is also an initial discontinuity size, ao, which is not the same as ad and is non-zero.
This is because real components and structures often contain initially non-detectable

discontinuities (voids, flaws, damage, inhomogeneities).

   At this point it is convenient to define some parameters that are used to describe fa-

tigue crack growth. In figure 9.3 a varying load is shown with a constant stress ampli-
tude and mean stress.3 The stress ratio R is defined as Vmin/Vmax, the stress range 'V =
Vmax  Vmin and the mean stress Vmean = ½(Vmax + Vmin). Note that any combination of
two of the parameters R, 'V, Vmin, Vmax and Vmean completely defines the load.

   Figure 9.3. Variables describing fatigue loading.

   If the maximum load level in fatigue is well below the critical value for the onset of
unstable crack extension, as is generally the case, LEFM can be applied. For a given
crack length all stress levels can then be converted to corresponding KI values using the
appropriate relation, e.g. KI = CV Sa · f(a/W).4

   The fatigue crack propagation rate is defined as the crack extension, 'a, during a
small number of cycles, 'n, i.e. the propagation rate is 'a/'n, which is usually written
as the differential da/dn. Because crack growth during one cycle is discontinuous, i.e.
there is an enhanced crack length increase during the rising part of the load and far less
or no crack growth during the descending part, the minimum value of dn is one cycle.

   Experimental determination of fatigue crack growth curves for every type of compo-
nent, loading condition, and crack size, shape and orientation in a structure is impracti-
cal, not to say impossible. Fortunately, at least for constant amplitude loading, one can
use the correlation between fatigue crack growth rate, da/dn, and the stress intensity
range, 'K, already discussed in section 1.10.

   The correlation of 'K and da/dn for constant amplitude loading was a very important
discovery. For example, suppose the relation between da/dn and 'K is known from
standard tests. Then provided the stress intensity  crack length relationship can be de-
termined for a component, it is possible to specify da/dn for each crack length, and the

3 In the figure a sinusoidal load is shown, but other waveforms could also be assumed.
4 In this chapter, as is usual in fatigue, the mode I stress intensity factor will be conveniently denoted as

   K, i.e. without the subscript I.
9. Fatigue Crack Growth                                                        211

required a  n curve can be constructed by integrating the standard da/dn  'K data
over the appropriate range of crack length (ad to acr in figure 9.2).

   The notion that da/dn is fully determined by 'K is known as the similitude approach,
with 'K as a similitude parameter. The approach can be defined as: "similar conditions
applied to the same system will have similar consequences", see reference 2. More spe-
cifically, a similar K cycle applied to a crack in a standard specimen will induce the
same crack length increment as when applied to a crack in a structure with an arbitrary
geometry consisting of the same material.

   This rule seems logical and physically sound, but careful examination is needed to
assure that similar conditions do indeed apply. In the case of fatigue crack growth, as
will be discussed below, it is often found that besides 'K the crack growth rate also de-
pends on stress ratio, load frequency, environment, shape of the load cycle, temperature,
and load history. Moreover, in view of the stress state, material thickness and crack ge-
ometry can also be significant.

The Fatigue Crack Growth Rate Curve da/dn  'K
The characteristic sigmoidal shape of a da/dn  'K fatigue crack growth rate curve is
shown in figure 9.4, which divides the curve into three regions according to the curve
shape, the mechanisms of crack extension and various influences on the curve. In region
I there is a threshold stress intensity range, 'Kth, below which cracks either propagate at
an extremely low rate or do not propagate at all. Knowledge of 'Kth permits the calcu-
lation of permissible crack lengths and/or applied stresses in order to avoid fatigue crack
growth. Above the threshold value the crack growth rate increases relatively rapidly

Figure 9.4. Characteristics of the fatigue crack growth rate curve da/dn  'K.
212      Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

with increasing 'K.
   In region II the crack growth rate, da/dn, is often some power function of 'K, lead-

ing to a linear relation between log(da/dn) and log('K). Finally, in region III the crack
growth rate curve rises to an asymptote where the maximum stress intensity factor,
Kmax, in the fatigue stress cycle becomes equal to the critical stress intensity factor, Kc.

   There have been many attempts to describe the crack growth rate curve by `crack
growth laws', which usually are semi or wholly empirical formulae fitted to a set of
data. The most widely known is the Paris equation

              da dn = C('K)m . (9.1)

Forman proposed the following well-known `improved' relation:
              da = C('K)m . (9.2)
              dn (1  R)Kc  'K

Paris' equation describes only the linear log-log (region II) part of the crack growth
curve, as indicated in figure 9.4, while Forman's equation also describes region III.

   It is also possible to describe the complete da/dn  'K curve by an expression like

                  §'K n th· 1 n3
            ­1  ¨ ¸ ½

                  ©         ¹

where n1, n2 and n3 are empirically adjusted exponents. McEvily, reference 3, devel-
oped yet another relatively simple equation:

     da         2§             'K ·
     dn = C('K  'Kth) ¨1 +         ¸.                  (9.4)
                  © Kc  Kmax¹

   The significance of such equations is limited, but they can be useful in providing a
first estimate of crack growth behaviour, especially if the material concerned exhibits
region II behaviour over a wide range of crack growth rates (see section 9.5). An exam-
ple is given in figure 9.5. The material is a higher strength structural steel often used for
offshore structures, reference 4 of the bibliography to this chapter.

   Figure 9.6 gives an impression of the crack growth rate behaviour of a number of
well-known structural materials for low values of the stress ratio, R = Vmin/Vmax (the
numbers in square brackets are references in the bibliography). The positions of the
crack growth rate curves for the various types of material represent a general trend.
Thus aluminium alloys generally have higher crack propagation rates than titanium al-
loys or steels at the same 'K values, and the data for steels fall within a surprisingly
narrow scatter band despite large differences in composition, microstructure and yield
strength.

   The ability of 'K to correlate fatigue crack growth rate data depends to a large extent
on the fact that the alternating stresses causing crack growth are small compared to the
yield strength. Therefore crack tip plastic zones are small compared to crack length or
other relevant dimensions, e.g. ligament size, even in very ductile materials like stain-
less steels.

   However, even though they are small, fatigue crack plastic zones can significantly
affect the crack growth behaviour. This will be shown in the next section.

9.3 The Effects of Stress Ratio and Crack Tip Plasticity: Crack Closure

   The Paris equation states that da/dn is solely determined by 'K. Other influences
were thought to be secondary to that of 'K and as a consequence they were neglected.
214      Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

Figure 9.7. Influence of R on fatigue crack growth in aluminium alloy 2024-T3 Alclad sheet.

The effect of the stress ratio, R, was also assumed to be a secondary effect, but later ex-
periments showed that for many materials R can significantly affect fatigue crack
growth behaviour. This is expressed by the equation already given in section 1.10, i.e.

     da
     dn = f('K,R) .                                    (9.5)

   In other words, besides the stress intensity range, 'K, there is an influence of the
relative values of Kmax and Kmin, since R = Vmin/Vmax = Kmin/Kmax. This is illustrated in
9. Fatigue Crack Growth  215

figure 9.7, which shows that crack growth rates at the same 'K value are generally
higher when R is more positive.

   There is no immediately obvious explanation for the effect of R. A proper explana-
tion requires the understanding of crack closure, to be discussed next. However, it is
worth noting here that the effect of R has proved to be strongly material dependent, a
fact readily observed by comparing figures 9.5 and 9.7.

Crack Tip Plasticity and Crack Closure

In the early 1970s Elber (reference 10 of the bibliography) discovered the phenomenon
of crack closure, which can help in explaining the effect of R on crack growth rates. He
found that fatigue cracks are closed for a significant portion of a tensile load cycle,
probably owing to residual plastic deformation left in the wake of a growing crack. This
phenomenon is normally designated as plasticity-induced crack closure.

   At the tip of a growing fatigue crack each loading cycle generates a monotonic plas-
tic zone during increased loading and a much smaller reversed (cyclic) plastic zone
during unloading. The reversed plastic zone is approximately one-quarter of the size of
the monotonic plastic zone. This means there is residual plastic deformation consisting
of monotonically stretched material.

    The relative sizes of the monotonic and cyclic plastic zones can be understood from a superposition
model. Figure 9.8.a shows Irwin's solution for the (forward) monotonic plastic zone with a size given by
(cf. section 3.2)

Figure 9.8. Superposition model for the relative sizes of monotonic and cyclic plastic zones at
               the tip of a fatigue crack.

     2ry = ¨ ¸ .                                   (9.6)
     S © Vys ¹

To obtain the solution (figure 9.8.c) for a zone of reversed plastic flow, i.e. Vy changing from +Vys to Vys
on unloading, it is necessary to subtract the solution in figure 9.8.b from that in figure 9.8.a. In the solu-

tion shown in figure 9.8.b the yield stress is `doubled'. Therefore it can be argued that the size of the re-
versed (cyclic) plastic zone, 2ryc, depends on the magnitude of 'K and twice the yield strength, i.e.

     2rc 1 y = § 'K ·2 . (9.7)
          S ©2Vys¹

Consequently, for R = 0 the ratio of the monotonic and cyclic plastic zone sizes is 4, because now 'K =
Kmax. For positive R the ratio is smaller than 4 and for negative R it is larger.

   As the crack grows the residual plastic deformation forms a wake of monotonically
stretched material along and perpendicular to the crack flanks. This is depicted in figure
9.9 for the case of gradually increasing K levels and hence gradually increasing plastic
zone sizes.

   Figure 9.9. Zones of plastic deformation in the vicinity of a fatigue crack.

   Because the residual deformation illustrated in figure 9.9 is the consequence of ten-
sile loading, the material in the crack flanks is elongated normal to the crack surfaces
and has to be accommodated by the surrounding elastically stressed material. This is no
problem as long as the crack is open, since then the crack flanks will simply show a dis-
placement normal to the crack surfaces. However, as the fatigue load decreases the
crack will tend to close and the residual deformation becomes important. This will be
illustrated with the help of figure 9.10, as follows:

1) Figure 9.10.a shows the variation in the nominal stress intensity factor, K, with ap-
   plied stress, V.

2) Figure 9.10.b shows that as the applied stress decreases from Vmax the crack tip
   opening angle decreases owing to elastic relaxation of the cracked body. However,
   the crack surfaces are prevented from becoming parallel because the stretched mate-
   rial along the flanks causes closure before zero load is reached. This closure results
   in the flanks exerting reaction forces onto each other. Since this is a case of crack-
   line loading, see section 2.5, a mode I stress intensity will develop which increases as
   the applied stress decreases.

   ing stress, Vop, is indicated. This important concept was defined by Elber as that
   value of applied stress for which the crack is just fully open. It can be determined
218      Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

   experimentally from the change in compliance: increasing crack closure results in an
   increase of stiffness and a decrease in compliance. Elber further suggested that for
   fatigue crack growth to occur the crack must be fully open. Thus an effective stress
   intensity range, 'Keff, can be defined from the stress range Vmax  Vop. Obviously
   'Keff is smaller than the nominal 'K.

    Elber's suggestion that fatigue crack growth occurs only when the crack is fully open is not entirely
correct. In fact it would be better to define 'Keff as Kmax  Kmin,eff, see figure 9.10.c. However, Kmin,eff
cannot be determined experimentally, whereas the crack opening stress, Vop, can be determined by meas-
uring a stress-displacement curve (see figure 9.11).

Figure 9.11. Measuring the crack opening stress by means of a stress-displacement curve.

    As schematically shown in figure 9.11, the stress-displacement curve is linear above Vop: the crack is
fully open and the stiffness does not change provided the crack does not grow significantly during the
measurement. Below Vop the crack will close increasingly as the stress decreases. This is reflected by an
increasing slope of the stress-displacement curve. The stress below which the curve starts to deviate from
linearity can be considered the crack opening stress, Vop.

    Note that to perform this closure measurement the displacement has to be accurately determined at a
well-chosen place using a strain gauge, a clip gauge or another displacement measurement device. Fur-
thermore, a slight hysteresis is often visible between loading and unloading. This leads to a difference
between Vop and the stress at which the crack starts closing during unloading. For convenience this effect
is ignored here.

   A higher R value implies a higher mean load relative to the load amplitude. As a re-

sult the crack flanks will be relatively further apart. This leads to less crack closure, i.e.

'Keff becomes more nearly equal to 'K. Elber therefore proposed that 'Keff accounts
for the effect of R on crack growth rates, so that

     da
     dn = f('Keff) ,                                             (9.8)

cf. equation (9.5). He also obtained the empirical relationship

     'Keff = U = 0.5 + 0.4R for 0.1 d R d +0.7 , (9.9)
      'K

which enabled crack growth rates for the indicated range of R values to be correlated by

Figure 9.12. Crack growth rate data from figure 9.7 correlated by 'Keff (reference 7 of the bib-
                liography).

'Keff. This crack closure function, which was obtained for the aluminium alloy 2024-
T3, has been modified by Schijve (reference 11 of the bibliography) as follows:

U = 0.55 + 0.35R + 0.1R2 for 1 d R d +1 .  (9.10)

The usefulness of equation (9.10) is demonstrated by figure 9.12, in which the crack
growth rate data from figure 9.7 are plotted against 'Keff. Although equations (9.9) and
(9.10) were found for aluminium alloy 2024-T3, they can often be used for other metal
alloys too.

    Elber measured Vop values from stress-displacement curves (the principle is shown in figure 9.11). In
contrast with this, Schijve used a similitude approach by using the assumption that an equal 'Keff leads to
220                         Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

an equal da/dn. He used a quadratic crack closure function, U, to let the da/dn  'Keff curves for different

R values coincide, cf. figures 9.7 and 9.12. An additional and necessary constraint was added to obtain the

result, i.e. the assumption that 'Keff = 'K for R = 1. This implies U = 1 for R = 1 and thus that the sum of

the coefficients of the quadratic crack closure function must be 1.

In general, exactly the same correlation will be found between da/dn and either 'Keff = U(R) 'K or
      *                     U(R)*
         =  q  U(R)  'K  =         'K,  where  q  is  an  arbitrary  constant  (see  reference  2).  The  resulting  ratios  of
'Keff
the coefficients of U(R) and U(R)* are the same, i.e. for a quadratic U: a/b/c = qa/qb/qc. In the da/dn 
'Keff plot given in figure 9.12, the use of U(R)* instead of U(R) only results in a shift to the left or to the

right, depending on q, but the correlation is the same. To obtain a definite solution either a physical meas-

urement, such as performed by Elber (see fig. 9.11), is needed or a U value must be assumed for a certain

R value.

Note that it is not always correct to assume that closure occurs for all R < 1. For example, recent

measurements on aluminium alloy 5083 showed that closure is absent for R t 0.5 (reference 12). In gen-

eral to obtain a quadratic closure function of the form of equation (9.10) the coefficients must satisfy

               a + bRc + cR2c = 1 ,

where Rc is the R value above which closure is absent. The closure function U now becomes 1 for R = Rc,
while for R > Rc the U value should be taken as 1.

   Since Elber's discovery of crack closure, numerous papers have been written on this

subject. Crack closure has made the application of the similitude approach more diffi-
cult. A prediction of da/dn in a cracked structure not only requires that the K applied to
the structure is known, but also the history of K during previous load cycles. Although

models have been developed to predict the variation of crack closure for any arbitrary K

history, many problems are involved and several assumptions must be made. For load-
ing situations with a slowly changing Kmax, i.e. a low dKmax/da, the situation is less dif-
ficult, since standard relations as presented by Elber or Schijve can be adopted to cal-
culate 'Keff.

Other Causes for Crack Closure

The approaches used by Elber and Schijve implicitly assume that (plasticity-induced)
crack closure is responsible for all load-ratio effects, and that the crack closure function
U = 'Keff/'K is a function of R alone. However, some authors, e.g. reference 13, ob-
served that besides R the closure function U may also depend on Kmax. This is specially
the case for high loads and high R values.

   Another factor that may play a role in the amount of closure is the crack front ge-
ometry. The experimental conditions under which both Elber and Schijve measured
crack growth and closure for the aluminium alloy 2024-T3 were such that shear lips
(see section 3.6) are likely to have been present on part of the fracture surfaces. This
may cause additional closure as is illustrated in figure 9.13.

   More recently it was shown that the roughness of shear lips can also affect the
amount of crack closure, see reference 15. Figure 9.14 shows fracture surfaces of
specimens of aluminium alloy 2024 subjected to identical fatigue loads but at different
frequencies. At the higher frequency a lower crack growth rate was found, which was
attributed to roughness-induced crack closure. Note that this type of closure can also re-
sult from the microstructure. For example, a large grain size may lead to crack path
tortuosity and thus to more roughness-induced closure.
9. Fatigue Crack Growth  221

 Figure 9.13. Cross-section of a through-thickness crack showing additional closure due to
                  shear lips (from reference 14).

   Other closure mechanisms have also been reported, such as (microstructural) trans-
formation of material near the crack, formation of oxides or corrosion products on the
crack surfaces or a (viscous) fluid resisting the closing and opening of the crack.
Stress Ratio Effect on Fatigue Threshold Stress Intensity Range
Besides the influence on crack growth rate in the 'K range where the Paris equation is
valid, crack closure plays an even more important role in the threshold region. In this
region of very low crack growth rates the loads are low leading to small average crack
opening values. This means that different closure mechanisms can be operative. For
materials with only limited closure effects 'Kth is more or less independent of R. On the
other hand, for example, 'Kth for the aluminium alloy 2024-T3 decreases with increas-

                  stant 'K = 20 MPa m, R = 0.11 and 42-55% relative humidity.

ing stress ratio R, as is clearly shown in figure 9.15. In this alloy closure plays a signifi-
cant role (see also figures 9.7 and 9.12).

   A simple description of the effect of R on the fatigue crack growth threshold is given
by Schmidt and Paris (reference 17). They assumed that

· the threshold condition for fatigue crack growth corresponds to a constant effective
   stress intensity range, 'Kth,eff, that is independent of R,

· no crack closure will occur at R values above a certain critical value, Rc,
· the opening stress intensity level, Kop, is independent of R for R < Rc, i.e. when crack

   closure does occur.

The consequences of these assumptions are depicted in figure 9.16, where Kmax, Kmin,
Kop, all at the threshold of crack growth, and 'Kth are plotted as a function of R. For R <
Rc, i.e. in the presence of closure, Kmax = Kop + 'Kth,eff, and since both Kop and 'Kth,eff
are assumed constant Kmax must be constant too. This implies that 'Kth will vary line-
arly with R according to 'Kth = (1  R)Kmax. For R > Rc, i.e. in the absence of crack clo-
sure, 'Kth will be constant and equal to 'Kth,eff. Clearly both Kmax and Kmin will now
increase with R.

9.4 Environmental Effects

   Fatigue crack growth is a complex process influenced by a number of variables be-
sides the effective crack tip stress intensity range. In particular the environment and
material microstructure can have large influences in various regions of the crack growth
rate curve, cf. figure 9.4.
9. Fatigue Crack Growth  223

 Figure 9.16. Kmax, Kmin and Kop at the fatigue crack growth threshold (a) and 'Kth (b) as a
                  function of R.

   Environmental effects are very important in regions I and II of the crack growth rate
curve. Several types of environmental effects are schematically illustrated in figure
9.17. The first type, figure 9.17.a, is a reduction or elimination of 'Kth and an overall
enhancement of crack growth rates until high 'K levels, at which the purely mechanical
contribution to crack growth predominates.

   A second type of environmental effect, figure 9.17.b, differs from the first in that
above an intermediate 'K level there is an additional enhancement of crack growth rates
owing to monotonic, sustained load fracture during the tensile part of each stress cycle.
This behaviour is typical for fatigue in liquid environments that cause stress corrosion.
On the other hand a gaseous environment, usually hydrogen, that causes sustained load
fracture can give the type of behaviour shown in figure 9.17.c. (Sustained load fracture
is discussed as a separate topic in chapter 10.)

   Finally, figure 9.17.d shows a type of environmental effect in which there is an over-
all enhancement of crack growth rates except near the threshold. In such cases 'Kth in
the aggressive environment can even be higher! This can be explained in some instances
by local corrosion on the crack surfaces. The corrosion products increase the volume of
material contributing to crack closure, thereby raising Vop and decreasing 'Keff. This
will be discussed in more detail in chapter 13, section 13.4.

Remarks

1) Despite the last statement about corrosion products and crack closure it is not in-

tended here to discuss possible mechanisms of environmental fatigue crack growth.

This is a controversial subject, since material  environment interactions at crack tips

are difficult to observe and apparently highly complex.

2) Environmental effects on fatigue crack growth strongly depend on the specific mate-

rial  environment combination and also on several other factors. The main ones are:

· Frequency of the fatigue stress cycle: low frequencies generally result in greater

     environmental effects.

· Waveform of the fatigue stress cycle: in general, a crack grows more per cycle if

     the increasing part of the load cycle occurs more slowly. For example, a positive

     sawtooth waveform       results in higher environmental fatigue crack

     growth rates than a negative sawtooth waveform      .

· Temperature: environmental effects are usually greater at higher temperatures.
                           9. Fatigue Crack Growth      225

   · A very high growth rate (high 'K) diminishes the importance of the environ-
       mental effect (Kmax during fatigue nears Kc, see figure 9.4).

3) The unusual shapes of the environmental fatigue crack growth rate curves in figures
   9.17.b and 9.17.c deserve comment. At intermediate 'K levels the overall crack
   growth rate suddenly increases greatly, followed by crack growth rates with a rela-
   tively weak dependence on 'K. This is a consequence of a major contribution to the
   overall crack growth by sustained load fracture. As will be discussed in chapter 10,
   sustained load fracture crack growth rates can be almost constant over a wide range
   of stress intensity.

9.5 Prediction of Fatigue Crack Growth Under Constant Amplitude
       Loading

   The main purpose of crack growth prediction is to construct a crack growth curve, a
versus n, like that shown schematically in figure 9.2. For constant amplitude loading
this is a fairly straightforward procedure of integrating da/dn  'K curves.

   It is often possible to use `crack growth laws' like equations (9.1)  (9.4). These are
useful because they are closed form expressions that can be integrated analytically. For
example, the crack growth rate data for BS4360 structural steel shown in figure 9.5 can
be expressed as

    da dn = 5.01 × 1012 ('K)3.1 m/cycle                 (9.11)

if 'K is in MPa m. For a wide plate one can substitute 'K = 'V Sa in equation (9.11),
giving

                                                  3.1

    da = 5.01 × 1012 ( 'V Sa) dn

or

    dn =  da

          5.01 × 1012( 'V Sa)                      3.1

and

    n =   ³ 1012      3.1      a1.55 da .               (9.12)

         5.01( 'V S)

                           ad

Note that the crack length a has to be in metres (m) because of the units for 'K.
   However, if finite width correction factors or more complicated crack growth laws

are necessary it becomes difficult to integrate crack growth rate data analytically. In-
stead a numerical approach must be used. This can be done in the following way:
· choose a suitable increment of crack growth, 'ai = ai+1  ai, i.e. small enough to ob-

   tain sufficient accuracy but not too small to cause an excessive calculation effort,
226  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

· calculate 'K for the crack length corresponding to the mean of the crack growth in-
   crement, i.e. (ai+1 + ai)/2,

· determine da/dn for this value of 'K,
· calculate 'ni from 'ai/(da/dn)i,
· repeat the previous steps over the required range of crack growth and sum the values

   of 'ni.

   Thus it is possible to predict crack growth from any type of da/dn  'K curve as long
as the relation between crack length, a, and 'K is known for the structure or component
under consideration. Herein lies the difficulty: in practice it may be difficult to estimate

'K owing to the complex geometry of the crack (e.g. semi-elliptical surface cracks or
quarter-elliptical corner cracks) and to the occurrence of load shedding. In built-up

structures cracked elements will shed load to uncracked elements because cracking

causes a decrease in stiffness and the displacements in each element are mutually con-

strained in a kind of `fixed grip' condition (see also section 4.2).

9.6 Fatigue Crack Growth Under Variable Amplitude Loading

   Although constant amplitude loading does occur in practice (e.g. pressurisation cy-
cles in transport aircraft cabins, rotating bending stresses in generators, thermal stress
cycles in pressure vessels) the vast majority of dynamically loaded structures actually
experience variable amplitude loading that is often fairly random. An example is given
in figure 9.18.

 Figure 9.18. Example of a fairly random cyclic load history (part of a flight for a tactical air-
                  craft).

   An important consequence of variable amplitude loading is that 'K need not increase
gradually with increasing crack length. For example, large and small stress ranges fol-
9. Fatigue Crack Growth  227

low each other directly in figure 9.18 and so the instantaneous 'K will vary greatly.
This variation results in load interaction effects which may strongly influence fatigue
crack growth rates. The nature of such interaction effects is best demonstrated by some
simple examples.

Simple Examples of Variable Amplitude Loading

The simplest type of variable amplitude loading is the occurrence of occasional peak
loads in an otherwise constant amplitude loading history. Figure 9.19 shows two such
simple variable amplitude loading histories with their effects on fatigue crack growth as
compared to constant amplitude loading. There is a profound effect on crack growth
owing to the occurrence of positive peak stresses only (curve C). However, the effect is
much less when positive peak stresses are immediately followed by negative peak
stresses (curve B). The explanation for these effects is as follows:

1) Positive peak stresses (curve C). Each peak stress opens up the crack tip much more
   than the normal maximum stress, but also creates a larger plastic zone ahead of the
   crack. There are three consequences when normal load cycling is resumed. Initially
   the amount of crack closure is reduced (due to the large plastic zone before the tip
   the crack may be fully open at minimum stress with 'Keff = 'K) and the crack will
   grow somewhat faster than before the peak stress occurred. However, the crack soon
   grows into the large plastic zone and encounters high residual compressive stresses
   because this plastic zone must be accommodated by the surrounding elastically
   stressed material. Also a wake of enhanced residual deformation forms behind the
   crack tip and causes an increase in crack closure.
   The overall result is a significant retardation of crack growth. This is often called

Figure 9.19. Crack growth curves under constant amplitude loading and constant amplitude
                loading + occasional peak loads for a centre cracked panel of aluminium alloy
                2024-T3 (reference 18 of the bibliography).
228  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

   delayed retardation, owing to the initial acceleration of crack growth following the
   peak stress.
2) Positive + negative peak stresses (curve B). The negative peak stress reverses most
   of the tensile plastic deformation due to the positive peak stress and the amount of
   crack growth retardation is greatly diminished.

   Since residual stresses and residual plastic deformation in the vicinities of crack tips
are responsible for interaction effects, the magnitude of these effects will depend on the
ratios of the peak stresses to the normal maximum stresses, the material yield strength
and strain hardening characteristics, and the stress state (plane strain or plane stress).
The larger plastic zones in plane stress result in much greater interaction effects.

 Figure 9.20. Examples of stationary and non-stationary variable amplitude loading.

More Complex Variable Amplitude Loading
For the purpose of this course variable amplitude loading can be placed in two catego-
ries:
· stationary variable amplitude loading;
· non-stationary variable amplitude loading.
Examples of both categories are shown in figure 9.20. This shows that repetitions of the
same sequence of load cycles are examples of stationary variable amplitude loading.
These sequences of load cycles are deterministic, i.e. non-random. However, a random
load sequence may also be classified as stationary if its statistical description is con-
stant, i.e. independent of time.

   In practice the loads are often a mixture of deterministic and random loads. For ex-
ample, a transport aircraft experiences deterministic ground-air-ground transitions (one
cycle per flight) and random gust loads (many cycles per flight), figure 9.21. Provided
that the statistical description of this mixture of loads is invariant with time, then such a
load sequence also may be classified as stationary variable amplitude loading.
9. Fatigue Crack Growth                                                        229

 Figure 9.21. Example of load history for a transport aircraft wing.

   In the previous part of this section it was shown that positive peak loads can cause
crack growth retardation. In turn this retardation may result in crack growth no longer
being a regular (i.e. stationary) process. To illustrate this, consider the loading histories
shown in figure 9.22. The first load history has peak loads with a long recurrence pe-
riod. Such a load history can result in large discontinuities in the crack growth curve.
Curve C in figure 9.19 is a good example. These discontinuities are pronounced because
the recurrence period is sufficiently long that each retardation is over before the next
peak load occurs.

   On the other hand, figure 9.22 shows that the second load history, which has peak
loads with a short recurrence period, results in an almost regular crack growth curve.
Retardations still occur, but they are superimposed on each other: this is, in fact, highly
effective in slowing down the overall crack growth.

   It is thus clear that the recurrence periods of peak loads are important for crack
growth under variable amplitude loading. Long recurrence periods will disturb the

Figure 9.22. Effect of peak load recurrence period on the crack growth curve.
230          Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

regularity of the crack growth process and it becomes non-stationary. Short recurrence
periods result in almost regular and stationary crack growth behaviour. These differ-
ences have consequences for the choice of methods to predict crack growth under vari-
able amplitude loading.

9.7 Prediction of Fatigue Crack Growth Under Variable Amplitude
       Loading

   Owing to load interaction effects it cannot be assumed that an increment of crack
growth, 'ai, in cycle i of a variable amplitude load history is directly related to 'Ki
Thus a straightforward summation procedure using constant amplitude crack growth
rate data (as in section 9.5) will not give proper results. Nevertheless such a summation
is sometimes done. The results are nearly always conservative, often extremely so, since
the most important consequence of load interaction effects is crack growth retardation.

   An empirical way of accounting for load interaction effects is to determine experi-
mentally whether crack growth rates under various kinds of variable amplitude loading
can be correlated by characteristic stress intensity factors, and if so to numerically inte-
grate the crack growth rate curves in the same way as for constant amplitude loading.
This method is subject to several limitations, as will be discussed.

   Besides this characteristic K method a number of crack growth models have been de-
veloped since about 1970 to try and account for load interaction effects and thereby en-
able predictions of crack growth curves. These models are of two kinds:

1) models based on crack tip plasticity (`first generation' models),
2) models based on crack closure (`second generation' models).

A concise review of these models will be made.

The Characteristic K Method

For some types of variable amplitude load history fatigue crack growth is a regular pro-
cess because peak loads have either a short recurrence period or only minor effects on
crack extension in subsequent load excursions. In such cases it is often possible to cor-
relate crack growth rates by a characteristic stress intensity factor. One possibility is the
root mean value of the stress intensity range, 'Krm. The general expression for 'Krm is

     'Krm =  m 6( 'Ki) m ni                                (9.13)
             6ni ,

where ni is the number of load cycles corresponding to 'Ki and m is the slope of the
constant amplitude da/dn versus 'K plot, i.e. the exponent in the Paris equation, equa-
tion (9.1).

    Note that in fact the characteristic K method implies that the regular fatigue crack growth rate da/dn
results from the different crack growth rate values (da/dn)i that each correspond to a stress intensity range
'Ki, according to
      9. Fatigue Crack Growth    231

da §da· §da·                     (9.14)
dn = f1©dn¹ + f2©dn¹ + ...... ,
1  2

where fi is the fraction ni/¦ni of the total number of load cycles with a stress intensity range 'Ki. It is im-
plicitly assumed that there are no interaction effects between different fractions.

   The main problem in the use of equation (9.13) is the derivation of 'K values. To do
this properly it is necessary to account for crack closure and follow a rational procedure
of cycle counting. A full discussion of this problem is given in reference 19 of the bibli-
ography, from which the example in figure 9.23 is taken. This figure shows that 'Krm
correlates regularly retarded crack growth under block programme loading with con-
stant amplitude crack growth. The reason is that correct derivation of 'Krm for block
programme loading results in a much smaller value than the 'Krm (= 'Keff) for constant
amplitude loading, and this successfully accounts for the shift in the block programme
crack growth rate curve owing to retardation.

 Figure 9.23. Crack growth rates in three ultrahigh strength steels correlated by 'Krm.

   A special case is narrow band random loading of steels, for which m was assumed to
be 2 and no account was taken of crack closure, reference 20. When m = 2 the stress
intensity range becomes the root mean square value, 'Krms. Since the root mean square
is a parameter characterizing a stationary random process it was considered that 'Krms
should correlate crack growth under stationary (narrow band) random loading. In fact,
good correlations were obtained. However, such correlations are very empirical and are
useful for predicting crack growth only for load histories very similar to those for which
the correlations were made.
232          Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

Crack Growth Models Based on Crack Tip Plasticity

These models assume that after a peak load there will be an interaction effect as long as
the crack tip plastic zones for subsequent load cycles are within the plastic zone due to
the peak load. The consequences of this assumption will be illustrated using figure 9.24
and a well known crack growth model introduced by Wheeler (reference 21 of the bibli-
ography).

Figure 9.24. Possible crack tip plastic zone sizes due to a load cycle following a peak load.

   Consider a crack that has grown to length ai after a peak load at length ap. The plastic
zone size due to the peak load is (2ry)p. There are three possible situations for the plastic
zone size (2ry)i due to load cycle i (which follows the peak load):

     (2ry)i < Oi or   (2ry)i < 1                                   (9.15)

Wheeler defined a crack growth retardation factor, I, as follows:

          ª(2ry)iº m  (2ry)i < 1
     Ii = « » for       Oi

          ¬ Oi ¼                                                   (9.16)

     Ii = 1  for (2ry)i Oi t 1 .

The plastic zone sizes (2ry)p and (2ry)i are given by              (9.17)

                     S ©CVys¹

where C is the plastic constraint factor that accounts for the effect of the stress state on
the plastic zone size, cf. section 3.5. The increment of crack growth, 'ai, occurring
during load cycle i is
                           9. Fatigue Crack Growth  233

'ai = Ii ©¨dn¹ §da¸· , ca                           (9.18)

where (da/dn)ca is the constant amplitude crack growth rate appropriate to the stress in-
tensity range, 'Ki, and stress ratio, Ri, of load cycle i. Note that as soon as Ii = 1 there is
no longer any retardation.

   The constant m in equation (9.16), designated by Wheeler as the retardation shaping

exponent, is empirical. It has to be found by fitting crack growth predictions to test data.

For this purpose a fairly simple variable amplitude load history is used. Once m is ob-

tained the crack growth curve for a complex variable amplitude load history is predicted

using a step by step counting method for each crack length ai:

· calculate (2ry)p and (2ry)i according to equation (9.17),
· calculate Oi (= ap + (2ry)p  ai),
· calculate Ii according to equation (9.16) or set Ii = 1 if (2ry)i t Oi,
· calculate 'ai according to equation (9.18),
· determine ai+1 = ai + 'ai,
· repeat the previous steps for each load cycle.

    Note that this procedure is basically different from the numerical integration of constant amplitude
data mentioned in section 9.5. For constant amplitude crack growth prediction a crack length increment is
taken and the cycles are summed. For variable amplitude crack growth prediction each cycle is taken and
the crack length increments are summed.

   Crack growth models like that of Wheeler have some success in predicting crack
growth under variable amplitude loading. However, the models rely completely on em-
pirical adjustment (i.e. of m) and do not incorporate effects such as delayed retardation
or the counteracting effect of negative peak loads discussed in the previous section.
These limitations make the models unreliable for truly predicting crack growth. In other
words they are useful mainly for curve fitting and interpolation of test results, but not
for extrapolation to significantly different load histories.

Crack Growth Models Based on Crack Closure

More recent crack growth models incorporate crack closure. This enables delayed retar-
dation and the effect of negative peak loads to be accounted for by the variation in Vop
and hence 'Keff. The main problem is to determine the correct variation in Vop during
variable amplitude loading. Discussion of specific solutions to this problem is beyond
the scope of this course. Interested readers may consult references 22 and 23 of the bib-
liography.

   Once the variation in Vop has been determined the procedure for estimating the crack
growth curve is as follows:

· calculate (Vop)i for load cycle i as a function of R and previous positive and negative
   load cycles (e.g. by the method in reference 22),

· determine ('Veff)i = (Vmax)i  (Vop)i and hence ('Keff)i,
· calculate 'a = (da/dn)i = f{('Keff)i}: for this step constant amplitude crack growth

   rate data correlated by 'Keff are necessary, e.g. figure 9.12,
234  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

· determine ai+1 = ai + 'ai,
· repeat the previous steps for each load cycle.

   The relatively complex way in which Vop must be determined for each load cycle and
the step by step counting method of generating the crack growth curve requires long
calculating times. However, the results are very promising in terms of both interpolation
of test data and truly predicting crack growth.

   Elber (reference 24 of the bibliography) proposed using a constant Vop determined
from constant amplitude testing of the same material. This would eliminate the tedious
calculation of Vop for each load cycle, but at the same time would limit the use of crack
closure based models to variable amplitude load histories that result in fairly regular
crack growth.

9.8 Fatigue Crack Initiation

   In the introduction to this chapter the importance of the initiation phase in fatigue
crack growth was already pointed out. From a fracture mechanics point of view the
main difficulty in dealing with this phase is the fact that application of LEFM to mi-
crocracks is either impossible, in which case EPFM must be used, or possible only with
substantial modifications and restrictions.

Fatigue Limit Stress Range and Fatigue Threshold Stress Intensity Range

In practice the fatigue limit stress range, 'Ve, is often used for design purposes in a wide
variety of engineering materials. 'Ve is the limiting value for the stress range that leads
to a very long or an infinite fatigue lifetime and thus to some extent characterises initia-
tion behaviour of the material.

   Originally the fatigue limit was thought to represent the inability of a material to ini-
tiate a crack at the applied stress levels. However, this idea was contradicted by the ob-
servation that cracks often develop at stress ranges well below the fatigue limit. At pres-
ent it is recognised that these so-called non-propagating cracks form at a relatively
early stage, grow for a short period but then remain dormant, reference 25. In view of
this, the fatigue limit should refer to the stress range required for a microcrack to over-
come the strongest barrier it will encounter.

   During what is considered to be the crack initiation period (cf. figure 9.1) fatigue
cracks develop during the first load cycles, but depending on the load magnitude be-
come quiescent for some time before they eventually succeed in crossing existing barri-
ers and grow into macrocracks. An example of an important (micro) structural barrier is
the grain boundary. A growing microcrack can be retarded or even stop at a grain
boundary. This explains why the presence of small grains at the surface can lead to a
higher fatigue limit.

   In principle the fatigue limit stress range, 'Ve, is measured on smooth specimens.
However, factors such as surface roughness, defects or cracks will lower the measured
value (see also under the subheading "Fatigue Strength and Defect Size" in this section).
The value of the fatigue limit stress range in the presence of cracks, denoted as 'Vth,
9. Fatigue Crack Growth   235

can be expected to decrease with crack length. On the other hand, for very short cracks
'Vth approaches the fatigue limit stress range for smooth specimens, 'Ve.

   On the basis of experiments, Kitagawa and Takahashi (reference 26), put forward the
idea that there is a critical crack size, lo, below which cracks do not affect the fatigue
limit and thus

'Vth = 'Ve for a < lo .   (9.19)

This observation is in accordance with the notion discussed above, i.e. that small cracks
already develop during the first load cycles, and that therefore it is irrelevant whether or
not such microcracks are present before the load is applied.

   For cracks longer than lo linear elastic fracture mechanics can be applied and 'Vth is
determined by the threshold stress intensity range for long cracks, 'Kth. Assuming KI =
V Sa, then

'Vth = 'Kth for a > lo .  (9.20)
           Sa

   Figure 9.25 shows an example of a so-called Kitagawa-Takahashi diagram. This is a
double logarithmic plot of 'Vth versus crack length. The two extreme conditions given
by equations (9.19) and (9.20) are represented in this plot as straight lines. The crack
length at which the two lines intersect is the critical crack size lo. It follows from equa-
tions (9.19) and (9.20) that at this critical crack size

236  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

              'Ve = 'Kth                           (9.21)

                   S © 'Ve ¹

The value of lo for a certain material can thus be calculated on the basis of the fatigue
limit measured on smooth specimens and the fatigue threshold for specimens with long
cracks. However, no obvious relation has been established between lo and the micro-
structure of different materials.

   It should be noted that the `short crack' behaviour described by the Kitagawa-
Takahashi diagram can also be interpreted as a threshold stress intensity range that de-
creases as soon as the crack length becomes smaller than lo. However this interpretation
is limited by the applicability of LEFM to short cracks.

   As might be expected, measurements (reference 26) indicate that the transition be-
tween `short crack' and `long crack' behaviour is not abrupt. Especially near lo, both
straight lines in figure 9.25 appear to be non-conservative. On empirical grounds El
Haddad et al., references 28 and 29, proposed a modified expression for the stress inten-
sity range that accounts for the different behaviour of short cracks as compared to long
cracks, i.e.

     'K = C 'V S(a + lo) ,                         (9.22)

where C is a factor accounting for the crack geometry (| 1). Using the expression for lo,
equation (9.21), it follows that when a o 0 the stress intensity range in equation (9.22)
will be equal to 'Kth if C 'V = 'Ve, the fatigue limit stress range for smooth specimens.
This means that for all crack lengths a fatigue limit stress range 'Vth can be calculated
from the `long crack' threshold stress intensity range 'Kth using the relation

     'Vth = 'Kth .                                 (9.23)
             C S(a + lo)

This relation, also plotted in figure 9.25 for C = 1, is found to represent experimental
data reasonably well, reference 28. In any case the straight lines non-conservatism
seems largely to have been eliminated.

Fatigue Crack Growth from Notches

Cracks preferentially initiate at or near free surfaces, owing to the presence of surface
roughness or scratches that can be found even on smooth, highly polished parts (a few
micrometers can be enough). But also precipitates, inclusions and other imperfections in
the bulk of the material can act as stress concentrators and lead to crack initiation.

   Owing to the presence of a stress concentrator such as a notch, crack growth often
begins under conditions of local plasticity. The crack then proceeds through the elastic
stress-strain field of the notch before it reaches the bulk stress-strain field. This situation
9. Fatigue Crack Growth  237

 Figure 9.26. Growth of a small fatigue crack at a notch and the associated elastic and plastic
                  stress-strain fields.

is depicted schematically in figure 9.26.
   When the crack is propagating in the notch plastic field it is incorrect to use LEFM to

characterize crack growth. This is demonstrated by the fact that crack growth rates are

 Figure 9.27. Schematic of anomalous crack growth rates for cracks at notches.
238  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

much higher than those expected on the basis of the nominal 'K values. However, even
in the notch elastic field the crack growth rate data for short cracks are not correlated by
'K.

   There are three kinds of deviation from the normal da/dn  'K curve, figure 9.27. For
notches with both plastic and elastic stress-strain fields the crack growth rates are ini-
tially high but decrease with increasing crack length (and nominal 'K) because growth
is controlled by the plastic strain range, which diminishes rapidly. In the notch elastic
field crack growth rates may or may not correlate with the normal da/dn  'K curve.
This depends on the crack length: short cracks tend to grow faster than long cracks at
the same 'K.

   Note that at small loads it is conceivable that cracks start growing at notches, but that
they will arrest when they grow out of the elastic field of the notch. The stress intensity
range for long cracks then becomes smaller than the threshold stress intensity range,
'Kth, for long cracks.

   A major reason for short cracks in the notch elastic field to grow faster than long
cracks is the difference in residual plastic deformation in the wakes of the cracks. Figure
9.28 compares short and long cracks with the same 'K. The lesser amount of residual
deformation for the short crack results in less crack closure, a higher 'Keff and hence a
higher crack growth rate.

Figure 9.28. Differing plasticity in the wakes of short and long cracks with the same 'K.

   Several attempts have been made to account for the faster growth of short cracks at
notches. They all provide `corrections' to the physical crack length. Some examples are
given here.
1) Crack within the notch elastic field

   El Haddad et al., reference 29, proposed a correction analogous to that expressed by
   equation (9.22), i.e.

     'K = kc 'V S(a + lo) ,                                                                (9.24)

where kc is a factor that accounts for the increase in crack tip stress owing to the
notch and lo is the fictitious crack length expressed by equation (9.21).

   Another useful correction is due to Smith and Miller, reference 30:
                    9. Fatigue Crack Growth           239

                                         § D ·1/2     (9.25)
for a < 0.13 DU , 'K = 'V Sa ©1 + 7.69 /U¹ ,
for a > 0.13 DU , 'K = 'V S(a + D) ,

   where U is the actual notch root radius and D is the depth of an elliptical notch with
   the same root radius.
2) Crack within the notch plastic field
   For this case El Haddad et al. proposed using either 'J for the corrected crack length
   (a + lo) or else a strain-based intensity factor, 'KH, defined as

'KH = E 'H S(a + lo) ,                                (9.26)

where 'H is the local plastic strain. Equation (9.26) appears simple, but 'H is not easy
to estimate. The same is true of 'J. Interested readers should consult references 28
and 29 of the bibliography.

Fatigue Strength and Defect Size

The threshold stress intensity range for crack growth and the fatigue limit stress range
are influenced by defects, inclusions and non-homogeneities. A serious reduction in fa-
tigue strength and also a considerable scatter can result. A very useful approach to hand-
le the effect of two-dimensional and three-dimensional defects is proposed by Mura-
kami and Endo (references 31 and 32). They introduced the square root area parameter
model, in which area is defined as the square root of the area obtained by projecting a
defect onto the plane perpendicular to the maximum tensile stress.

   The use of area as the parameter representing the effect of defects on the fatigue
properties is suggested by an approximate expression (accurate within 10%) for the
maximum stress intensity for surface cracks with widely varying shapes, i.e.:

KI,max | 0.65·V· S area .                             (9.27)

    For example for a semi-elliptical surface crack one can consider the appropriate K solution (see sec-
tion 2.8)

KI = 1.12 V Sa 2 §sin2M + §ac· cos2 2 M· 41 ,         (9.28)
3S S §a· ©              ©¹ ¹
8 + 8 ©c¹

and express a in terms of the crack area, ½Sac, i.e.

a = a/c 2/S area .                                    (9.29)

In figure 9.29 the ratio KI/V S area is plotted as a function of a/c for two locations along the crack
front, i.e. at the crack root (M = 90°) and at the intersection with the free surface (M = 0°). At these loca-
tions KI is at its maximum for shallow cracks (a/c < 1) and deep cracks (a/c > 1) respectively. It can be

seen that equation (9.27) applies within an accuracy of ±10% for the range 0.2 < a/c < 5.
240  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

Figure 9.29. KI/V S area for a semi-elliptical surface crack at the free surface and at the
                crack root as a function of the aspect ratio a/c.

Furthermore, it is argued that for three-dimensional defects, e.g. holes, the fatigue prop-
erties are determined by small cracks emanating from these defects. The assumption is
made that the stress intensity is determined by the projection of the three-dimensional
defect shape onto the plane normal to the maximum principal stress. This assumption
was experimentally verified by introducing various artificial defects. Results from fa-
tigue experiments in the range 20 < area < 1000 microns (µm) indicated that for a
wide range of materials

     'Kth v ( area)1/3 .                                        (9.30)

   The material behaviour in the area model is represented by the Vickers hardness,
HV, of the material matrix, i.e. the matrix without defects. In general 'Kth increases
with hardness. However, the stress range below the fatigue limit for which non-
propagating cracks are found is larger for softer materials. This behaviour is reflected by
the empirical relation

     'Kth v (HV + 120) ,                                        (9.31)

again based on data for a wide range of materials for which 70 < HV < 720 kgf/mm2.

    For a material like nodular cast iron it is difficult to estimate the hardness of the matrix, because nod-
ules will influence the outcome of the measurement. A simple correction for this is suggested by Endo
(reference 33), i.e.

     HV = HVn ,                                                 (9.32)
            1  fn

where HVn is the overall hardness of a matrix containing a volume fraction fn of porosity. For nodular cast
iron fn is assumed to be the volume fraction of nodules (graphite).

Equations (9.30) and (9.31) ultimately leads to the expression
9. Fatigue Crack Growth                                241

                3 1/3 §1R· D                           (9.33)

                                                   ©¹

where 'Kth is in MPa m, HV in kgf/mm2 and area in µm. The last term in the expres-
sion accounts for the effect of the load ratio, R; the exponent D = 0.226 + HV·104.

   The fatigue limit stress range in the presence of surface defects, 'Vth, can now also
be calculated. By substituting 'Kth for Kmax and 'Vth for V in equation (9.27) the rela-
tion between 'Kth and 'Vth for surface defects is obtained. In combination with equa-
tion (9.33) it follows that

                                         1/6 §1R· D    (9.34)

'Vth = 2.86 · (HV + 120) · ( area) · ¨ 2 ¸ .

                                               ©¹

   A K analysis for internal defects with various shapes leads to the approximate equa-
tion

KI,max | 0.5·V· S areai ,                              (9.35)

where areai applies to internal defects. Thus, by comparing this equation with equa-
tion (9.27), it can be concluded that an internal defect will yield the same KI,max com-
pared to a surface defect if

areai = 1.69 area .                                    (9.36)

The fatigue limit stress range in the presence of internal defects is now obtained by sub-
stituting areai for area in equation (9.34), i.e.

                                          1/6 §1R· D   (9.37)

'Vth = 3.12 · (HV + 120) · ( areai) · ¨ 2 ¸ .

                                                ©¹

   Equations (9.34) and (9.37) enable the fatigue limit stress range to be estimated
without actually doing a fatigue test. An accuracy of better than 15% is claimed for
materials with a Vickers hardness in the range of 100 to 740 kgf/mm2.

   The defect size, in terms of area, must also be within a certain range to apply the
  area model. For very large defects this can be understood by realizing that 'Kth has
now become constant and, given the form of both equation (9.27) and (9.35), 'Vth will

be proportional to ( area)1/2 instead of ( area)1/6. Although the upper limit for area

cannot be defined exactly, it is estimated to be approximately 1000 µm.
   For small defects it is also clear that there must be a limit to the applicability, since

the area model would predict an infinite fatigue limit for defect-free material. As dis-
cussed near the beginning of this section, cracks are assumed to form shortly after the
application of a fatigue load. If the applied stress range is below the fatigue limit stress
range, 'Ve, for smooth defect-free specimens, the microcracks can grow somewhat but
are then stopped by some microstructural barrier. Defects which are initially present but
are smaller than these non-propagating cracks will not affect the fatigue limit. Therefore
242  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

the lower limit for the applicability of the area model is related to the maximum size
of non-propagating cracks at the fatigue limit stress range 'Ve. By substituting 'Ve for
'Vth in either equation (9.34) or (9.37) the lower limit of area can be calculated. Ob-
viously this lower limit depends on the material.

Sustained Load
Fracture

10.1 Introduction

   Sustained load fracture is a general term for time-dependent crack growth under
loading often well below that normally required to cause failure in a tensile or fracture
toughness test. Examples of sustained load fracture are:
· creep and creep crack growth
· stress corrosion cracking
· cracking due to embrittlement by internal or external (gaseous) hydrogen
· liquid metal embrittlement.

   Creep deformation and cracking constitute a widespread and very important practical
problem, particularly in the power generating industry and aircraft gas turbines. How-
ever, a good and universally accepted description of creep cracking by fracture me-
chanics, whether LEFM or EPFM, is as yet unavailable.

   The other types of sustained load fracture follow basically similar trends in terms of
fracture mechanics. Thus, excluding creep, it is possible to discuss the application of
fracture mechanics to sustained load fracture in a general way. As with fatigue crack
growth the use of fracture mechanics is mainly limited to LEFM methods, specifically
the stress intensity (K) approach.

   The use of K to describe sustained load fracture is based mainly on procedures simi-
lar to those for fracture toughness testing, including the use of more or less standard
specimens with fatigue precracks under nominally plane strain conditions. However,
full plane strain is not strictly necessary if it is only required to test specimens with a
thickness representative of that for a narrow section component in service.

   Experimental methods for fracture mechanics evaluation of sustained load fracture
fall into two categories:
1) Time-to-failure (TTF) tests on precracked specimens.
2) Crack growth rate testing.
These methods will be discussed in sections 10.2 and 10.3 respectively, and the experi-
mental problems that arise are dealt with in section 10.4.

   The way in which crack growth rate data could be used to predict failure of a struc-
tural component in service is treated in section 10.5. However, there are many difficul-
ties that require careful evaluation of the practical significance of test data. This is the
subject of section 10.6, which closes the chapter.
246  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

10.2 Time-To-Failure (TTF) Tests

   For a long time the study of sustained load fracture (principally stress corrosion
cracking) relied solely upon TTF tests on smooth specimens. Such tests are still useful,
but it is now recognised that fracture mechanics based tests provide an essential sup-
plement. The most striking example concerns titanium alloys, which were thought to be
immune to stress corrosion in aqueous solutions until Brown in 1966 tested fatigue pre-
cracked cantilever beam specimens with disastrous results (reference 1 of the bibliogra-
phy to this chapter).

   Precracked specimens for TTF tests are configured such that a constant load results
in increasing stress intensity with increasing crack length. The specimens are loaded to
various initial stress intensity levels, KIi, and the time to failure is recorded. A represen-
tative TTF plot is shown in figure 10.1.

 Figure 10.1. Sustained load testing of precracked titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V specimens in normal
                  air.

The plot shows that two quantities, KImax and KIth, can be determined. KImax represents
the maximum load carrying ability and will generally be equal to either KIc or KQ the
valid or invalid fracture toughness values. KIth is the threshold stress intensity, below
which there is virtually no crack growth. For stress corrosion cracking the threshold is
customarily referred to as KIscc.

   In some cases KIth may be a true threshold. In general, however, KIth should not be
considered a material property. There are two reasons for this. First, the testing time re-
quired to establish KIth may be extremely long (years rather than months). Secondly,
some materials (notably steels) exhibit long incubation periods before sustained load
fracture commences from the fatigue precrack, and the incubation periods increase with
decreasing KIi.
          10. Sustained Load Fracture                247

Figure 10.2. Schematic TTF plot.

   Figure 10.2 shows schematically that in the regime between KIth and KImax the time to
failure, tf, generally comprises an incubation time, tinc, and a period of subcritical crack
growth. The incubation time depends on the material, environment, KIi and also on the
previous loading history (if any) of the specimen. The subcritical crack growth period
depends on the specimen configuration, type of loading, amount of crack growth before
KImax is reached, and the kinetics of crack growth due to the material-environment inter-
action.

   As stated earlier, precracked specimens for TTF tests are such that a constant load re-
sults in increasing stress intensity with increasing crack length. A commonly used
specimen is the fatigue precracked cantilever beam specimen developed by Brown and
co-workers at the US Naval Research Laboratory. The specimen and loading arrange-
ment are illustrated in figure 10.3.

   The cantilever beam specimen usually has side grooves reducing the nominal width
from B to BN. Side grooves are beneficial in obtaining a more even stress distribution
through the thickness, since they prevent the occurrence of a plane stress state at the
specimen side surfaces. The results are a more uniform crack front and prevention of
out-of-plane crack deviation for some specimen types.

   Stress intensity factors for cantilever beam specimens can be calculated according to:

      6M                          §a·
KI =                              3·f ¨W¸ ,          (10.1)

where M is the bending moment, W is the beam depth, and a is the total crack length,
see figure 10.3. The geometry factor, f(a/W), is given in the following table.

10.3 Crack Growth Rate Testing

   The general features of the dependence of sustained load crack growth on KI were al-
ready mentioned in section 1.10 (figure 1.14) and are shown again in figure 10.4. The
crack growth curve consists of three regions. In regions I and III the growth rate da/dt
strongly depends on the stress intensity, but in region II the crack growth rate is virtu-
ally independent of stress intensity. Regions I and II are the most characteristic, al-
though region II is sometimes a rounded hump rather than a plateau. Region III is often
not observed, owing to an abrupt transition from region II to fast fracture. Note that KIth
and KImax can be determined, at least in principle, from crack growth rate tests.

   Many types of specimen have been proposed for studying sustained load crack
growth. Most fall into either the increasing K (constant load) or decreasing K (fixed
grip) categories: compare also with section 5.4.
10. Sustained Load Fracture  249

 Figure 10.4. Generalised sustained load crack growth behaviour.

   Advantages of decreasing K specimens are:
· Fatigue precracking from a sharp notch is not always necessary, since initial me-

   chanical crack growth is stable, or eventually stable in case of a `pop-in', and usually
   does not influence subsequent sustained load fracture.
· Virtually the entire crack growth curve can be obtained from one specimen.
· They can be self-stressed (e.g. figure 10.5) and therefore portable: for example, they
   can be exposed outdoors.
· Steady state conditions for crack growth and arrest at KIth are more readily achieved.
A disadvantage of using decreasing K specimens is the occurrence of corrosion product
wedging for some material-environment combinations. For a decreasing K specimen the
initial displacement is fixed, so that the crack tip tends to narrow during propagation.
Corrosion products may form a wedge between the crack surfaces and lead to a higher
crack growth rate at a given nominal KI and to apparently lower KIth values. These ef-

fects are very difficult to assess quantitatively.
   Two types of commonly used decreasing K specimens, the modified crack-line

wedge-loaded (CLWL) and the double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens, are shown in
figures 10.5 and 10.6. These types of specimens (though not self-stressed) have already
been mentioned in sections 5.4 and 4.4 respectively. Both types require determination of
the elastic compliance in order to calculate stress intensity factors, and the expressions
for KI are unfortunately -- cumbersome, equations (5.2) and (4.25). Some more guid-
ance for the calculation of stress intensity factors in CLWL specimens is given in refer-
ence 2.

   There is a third category of specimens, namely those giving a constant K under con-
stant load. Such specimens have not been so widely used, but for detailed studies of

        10. Sustained Load Fracture  251

sustained load fracture they provide a valuable adjunct to increasing and decreasing K

tests. An example is the tapered double cantilever beam (TDCB) specimen, figure 10.7.
As mentioned in section 4.4, for this specimen (3a2 + h2)/h3 is constant. This results in a
linear increase in compliance with crack length, i.e. dC/da is constant. For a given load
P the stress intensity factor under plane strain conditions is given by

KI = P        E dC                   (10.2)
        2BN(1  Q2)·da

Hence KI is constant when dC/da is constant. In practice the contour in figure 10.7 is
often approximated by a straight line in order to facilitate specimen manufacture.

Difference in Behaviour for Increasing and Decreasing K Specimens

A schematic of the difference in behaviour of increasing K (constant load) and decreas-
ing K (fixed grip) specimens is given in figure 10.8. Note that the ordinate is now KI,
not KIi as in the case of TTF plots.

10.4 Experimental Problems

   There are a number of experimental difficulties associated with sustained load frac-
ture testing, including
· the incubation time, tinc
· non-steady state crack growth

252  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

· effect of precrack morphology
· influence of sustained load crack morphology
· curved crack fronts
· corrosion product wedging.

Incubation Time, tinc

As mentioned already in section 10.2, the incubation time, tinc, depends on KIi and the
previous loading history of the specimen. The loading history stems from the fatigue
precracking process and can include effects of plastic deformation. Exposure to an ag-
gressive environment before sustained loading can also affect tinc. Furthermore, tinc --
or rather: the apparent incubation time -- strongly depends on the methods of detecting
crack growth, e.g. visual inspection, compliance measurements or acoustic emission.

Non-Steady State Crack Growth

A high KIi applied to a decreasing K specimen or a rapid increase in stress intensity for
an increasing K specimen can lead to crack growth rates initially lower than those pre-
dicted by the da/dt-KI diagram. This non-steady state crack growth is caused by changes
in the electrochemical reactions at the crack tip. (Further discussion of this interesting
problem is beyond the scope of this course.)

Effect of Precrack Morphology

Stress corrosion tests on aluminium alloys with DCB specimens have shown that me-
chanical `pop-in' precracks result in displacement of the crack growth curve (particu-
larly region I, figure 10.4) to higher KI values as compared to fatigue precracks, refer-
ence 3 of the bibliography. This was explained by the fact that fatigue precracks gener-
ate relatively planar stress corrosion cracks with uniform crack fronts, whereas pop-in
cracks, being more irregular, lead to similarly irregular stress corrosion cracks which
require more driving force.

Influence of Sustained Load Crack Morphology

The morphology of the sustained load crack front is especially important for tests to
determine KIth. Crack tip blunting and/or microbranching in decreasing K tests lead to
apparent KIth values higher than those obtained from increasing K tests, where sustained
load crack initiation occurs from a relatively sharp and unbranched fatigue precrack.

Curved Crack Fronts

Curved crack fronts often occur during sustained load fracture testing and become more
pronounced as the specimen thickness is decreased. In general the reason for this cur-
vature is the change in stress state from plane strain in the specimen interior to plane
stress at the surface. Side grooves, as in figure 10.3, are helpful in reducing curvature,
which is a nuisance primarily because it leads to errors in using surface crack lengths to
calculate crack growth rates.

Corrosion Product Wedging

Corrosion product wedging has been mentioned already in section 10.3 as a disadvan-
tage of using decreasing K specimens, since the wedging action leads to higher crack
growth rates at a nominal KI and to apparently lower KIth values. To determine whether
corrosion product wedging has influenced crack growth the specimen can be unloaded
after testing and the deflection at the load line can be remeasured and compared to that
at the beginning of the test. If the deflections are nearly the same, no substantial amount
of corrosion products has accumulated in the crack and therefore wedging has not oc-
curred.

10.5 Method of Predicting Failure of a Structural Component

   As shown in figure 10.2 the time to failure, tf, generally comprises an incubation
time, tinc, and a period of subcritical crack growth. Therefore in the first instance the
prediction of failure of a structural component is a twofold problem:

1) Prediction of tinc.
2) Prediction of the crack growth period.

   As a reminder, the incubation time depends on the material, environment. initial
stress intensity (KIi) and prior loading history. A convenient way of determining tinc for
a certain material environment combination is to use decreasing K (fixed grip) speci-
mens and load them to various KIi values. By starting at high KIi levels the long incuba-
tion times can be avoided and yet the locus of tinc can be found, as shown schematically
in figure 10.9. Note that, as in figure 10.8, the ordinate is KI, not KIi.

   Crack growth rates, da/dt, depend on the material, environment and stress intensity
factor KI. Thus the crack growth period will depend strongly on specimen (or compo-

nent) geometry and size, since these parameters control the variation of K with crack
length. For example, if large and small specimens which are geometrically similar are
loaded to the same KIi, the larger specimen takes longer to fail. In turn this means that
an estimate of the crack growth period for a structural component must be obtained by
integrating crack growth rate data. Figure 10.10 shows schematically how such an inte-
gration could be done.

   Finally, the time to failure, tf, for the component is obtained at least in theory -- by
summing tinc and the crack growth period. However, in practice there may be great dif-
ficulties. For example, the component geometry may be complex and stress intensity
factors difficult to obtain. Also, stresses may relax as a crack grows, or else may redis-
tribute owing to permanent changes in displacement (e.g. slip of bolted or riveted
joints). Another important factor is the service environment, which may differ consid-
erably from test environments.

10.6 Practical Significance of Sustained Load Fracture Testing

Threshold Stress Intensity, KIth
Most sustained load fracture tests are done with the primary aim of determining KIth.
Although useful for specific applications, actual values of KIth are not used as general
10. Sustained Load Fracture                                 255

design criteria because their significance for service performance has not been estab-
lished. This is not surprising in view of the fact that KIth depends on the material, envi-
ronment, temperature, stress state (plane strain or plane stress) and often on very long
testing times: the longer the testing times, the lower the apparent value of KIth.

   Despite these problems KIth is useful as a guide to material selection and design. For
example, figure 10.11 shows stress corrosion KIscc data for a number of commercial high
strength steels. In the very high strength regime KIscc is low, irrespective of alloy type,
composition, microstructure or heat treatment. This trend, in addition to the fact that
stress corrosion crack growth rates are high, indicates that stress corrosion cracking
cannot be tolerated by components made from very high strength steels. A fracture me-
chanics approach to design cannot be used. Instead, the components must be rigorously
inspected or proof loaded to ensure that they are free from macroscopic flaws, and thor-
ough protection against corrosion must be applied (this is good practice, whatever the
material).

    Proof loading is the application of a high load in the knowledge or expectation that if the component
does not fail, it will then survive in service a given time, after which the proof load may be repeated to
establish a further safe period of operation. There is always the possibility that the component will fail
during proof loading. Understandably, therefore, this method of component verification is not very popu-
lar.

   As a development of the foregoing, an important contribution to interpretation of KIth
testing has been made by the US Naval Research Laboratory, reference 6 of the bibliog-
raphy. This is the concept of Ratio Analysis Diagrams (RADs) in which a grid of lines

of constant KI/Vys are superimposed on KIc and KIth data plotted against Vys. An example
of such a diagram for practical interpretation of KIc has already been given in section
5.6.

   Figure 10.12 shows a KIc and KIscc RAD for a high strength stainless steel. On this
diagram the data zones for fast fracture (KIc) and initiation of stress corrosion crack
growth (KIscc are plotted with a grid of KI/Vys lines that separate the diagram into regions
of high, low and intermediate ratios according to the following rationale:

1) The high ratio region is where high stresses and large cracks are necessary to cause
   fast fracture or stress corrosion crack growth. A fracture mechanics approach to de-
   sign is relatively straightforward.

2) The low ratio region is where fast fracture or stress corrosion crack growth can initi-
   ate from very small defects at moderate to low stress levels. This region is where a
   fracture mechanics approach to design cannot be used.

3) The intermediate region is where the combination of high stresses and small flaws,
   low stresses and large flaws, or intermediate stress levels and flaw sizes are critical.
   This region is where a highly refined application of fracture mechanics is required
   for adequate design.

Crack Growth Rate Tests

Crack growth rate data can be useful in several ways:

· estimating KIth from decreasing K tests, section 10.3
10. Sustained Load Fracture  257

· predicting the service lives of components, provided that the incubation time tinc,
   non-steady state crack growth, and the practical difficulties mentioned at the end of
   section 10.5 are absent or can be accounted for

· deciding whether a period of safe crack growth exists, and if so, determining inspec-
   tion intervals for parts assumed or known to contain flaws.

   For some material-environment combinations the crack growth rates measured in
tests are so high that even though KImax may be much higher than KIth, it is clear that
there is no possibility of setting reasonable inspection intervals for a period of safe crack
growth. Examples are liquid metal embrittlement of various materials and aqueous
stress corrosion of high strength steels and titanium alloys. In these cases either the ma-
terial must have a high KIth value, or else sustained load fracture cannot be tolerated, as
mentioned earlier.

   On the other hand, important problems like stress corrosion cracking of high strength
aluminium alloys can be better understood by analysis of crack growth rate data. Figure
10.13 shows crack growth rate data for several 7000 series aluminium alloys exposed to
an outdoors environment of intermittent rain and moderate humidity. The data cover a
range of possibilities for region II crack growth:

a) Fast crack growth in 7079-T651.

Figure 10.13. Outdoor exposure stress corrosion cracking propagation in 7000 series aluminium
                  alloy plate, reference 7.
258  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

b) Fairly slow crack growth in 7075-T651 and 7178-T651.
c) Very slow crack growth in 7075-T7651.

   As an example, consider components made from these alloys and installed in struc-
tures with feasible inspection intervals of a few months. Only in case (b) is the region II
crack growth rate useful for estimating an inspection period of this time scale. In case
(a) the region II crack growth rate is too high. In case (c) crack growth is so slow that
inspection for cracks every few months is a waste of time.

Dynamic Crack
Growth and Arrest

11.1 Introduction

   In this concluding chapter on fracture mechanics and crack growth the behaviour of
statically loaded cracks growing beyond instability will be discussed.

   The onset of instability usually means failure of a component or structure. As such,
either instability cannot be allowed to occur, or else a partial (component) failure can be
tolerated until its detection by regular inspection. In the latter case the component must
be repaired or replaced if possible. Otherwise the structure has to be retired from serv-
ice.

   Certain structures belong to a category for which instability is always a possibility
and failure would be intolerable. Examples are pipelines, nuclear reactor pressure ves-
sels and liquid natural gas containers. For this category of structures the design and con-
struction must include features to ensure crack arrest.

   The foregoing examples illustrate the importance of unstable, i.e. dynamic, crack
growth and its arrest. However, the study of this phenomenon is a highly specialised
one, and is not amenable to detailed treatment in a basic course on fracture mechanics.
In what follows only general remarks about the different concepts will be made.

   In section 11.2 two basic aspects of dynamic crack growth will be described. First
the velocities of fast fractures and the fact that they are finite. Second, as a consequence
of finite crack velocity it is possible for crack branching to occur. Then in section 11.3
the conditions for crack arrest will be given together with their practical significance.

   Section 11.4 is an overview of the widely used fracture mechanics methods of ana-
lysing dynamic crack growth and arrest in pipelines and thick-walled pressure vessels,
and includes the concept of dynamic fracture toughness.

   In sections 11.5 and 11.6 some information will be given about experimental deter-
mination of dynamic fracture toughness and the instantaneous value of the dynamic
stress intensity factor.

   Finally, section 11.7 reports about more recent progress made in the field of elastic-
plastic fracture dynamics.

11.2 Basic Aspects of Dynamic Crack Growth

There are two basic aspects of dynamic crack growth:
260  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

1) Finite velocities of crack propagation.
2) Crack branching: this falls in the category of macrobranching rather than micro-

   branching (which commonly occurs during all kinds of crack growth).

Finite Velocities of Crack Propagation

Dynamic crack growth may be considered in terms of an energy balance. This will be
shown with the help of figure 11.1, which is a simplified crack resistance (G, R  a)
diagram. After initiation of unstable crack extension there is excess energy which in-
creases during crack growth. By the time the crack has reached a length ai the total ex-
cess energy has amounted approximately to the shaded area in figure 11.1. (In practice
G does not have to increase linearly with increasing crack length. Nor is it necessarily
valid that R remains constant during dynamic crack growth.)

Figure 11.1. G,R  a diagram showing the excess in energy some time after initiation of unsta-
                ble crack extension under plane strain conditions.

   The approximation in figure 11.1 is, however, convenient and adequate for further
analysis to indicate that crack velocities are finite. The analysis which follows was first
published by Mott, reference 1 of the bibliography to this chapter, as long ago as 1948.

   Assuming that the formulation for G is the same at the onset of crack extension and
during unstable fracture, the excess energy in figure 11.1 can be expressed by1

     ai                                 ai

     ³ ³ SV2a
     Uexcess = (G  R) da = R(ai  ao) +      Ec                      da .  (11.1)

     ao                                 ao

Note that since R = GIc is assumed to be constant there is a condition of plane strain.
Thus Ec = E/(1  Q2). Also, R is given by R = SV2ao/Ec. Substituting in equation (11.1)

1 As before, all energy quantities are defined per unit thickness.

           Uexcess =            (ai  ao) + (ai2  ao2)

                  2Ec

Mott argued that for a propagating crack the excess energy is stored as kinetic energy.
Some 25 years later this postulate was experimentally confirmed by Hahn et al., refer-
ence 2.

   A simple expression for the stored kinetic energy is obtainable from the opening dis-
placement of the crack flanks. From section 2.3 the displacement V in the y direction is

               2V                                                        (11.3)
           V = Ec a2  x2 .

If x is expressed as a fraction of a, i.e. x = Ca where 0 < C < 1, then

           V = 2VEc a2(1  C2) = C1 VaEc .                                (11.4)

As the crack propagates the displacement V will change with time. Denoting the rate of
change d/dt with `·', we may write

           V· = C1Va .·                                                  (11.5)
                 Ec

The material adjacent to the crack flanks is displaced with a velocity V·. The kinetic en-
ergy in the displaced material is T = ½mV·2. For a material of density U and per unit

thickness

   The solution of the integral in equation (11.6) will have the dimension [LENGTH]2.
For a semi-infinite plate the only significant length is the crack length a. Thus the inte-
gral can be expressed as ka2, and for a crack of length ai (see figure 11.1)

               1 · 2 2 V2                                                (11.7)
           T = 2 U a kai 2 .

                           Ec

   If all the excess energy owing to unstable crack growth is converted into kinetic en-
ergy, then Uexcess in equation (11.2) will equal T. Thus

The quantity Ec/U is the velocity, Vg, of a longitudinal wave in a material. Conse-
quently equation (11.8) can be rewritten as

     a·   S § ao·
         = ¨1  ¸ .                                                                        (11.9)
     Vg   k © ai¹

For long propagating cracks ai >> ao and equation (11.9) has a limit value of S/k. The
limit value has been calculated to be much less than unity, and experimental measure-
ments have provided confirmation of this. Thus it can be stated that the maximum velo-
city of a propagating crack will always be a fraction of the longitudinal wave speed.

   More elaborate analyses have shown that for a brittle material the theoretical maxi-
mum crack velocity is equal to the velocity of a surface wave.

Crack Branching

Dynamic crack growth may be accompanied by multiple branching of the crack. Some
authors have attempted to explain branching in terms of kinetic energy. But experiments
using high speed cameras have shown that branching does not alter the crack velocity.
This calls into question any analysis based on kinetic energy, since if kinetic energy
were used for crack branching the velocity would decrease.

   Such experiments have shown, however, that crack branching under mode I loading
occurs only when a specific stress intensity factor is exceeded. An illustration of this is
given in figure 11.2 for six glass plates containing crack starters in the form of notches
of increasing sharpness in the order a  f. The blunter the notch the higher the stress re-
quired to initiate fracture. This means that at any crack length the stress intensity factor
for the propagating crack is highest in specimen (a) and lowest in specimen (f). The re-

11. Dynamic Crack Growth and Arrest  263

sult, as figure 11.2 shows, is that crack branching is greatest in specimen (a) and least in
specimen (f).

   The dependence of crack branching on the stress intensity factor can be explained
qualitatively. When a specific stress intensity factor is exceeded new cracks initiate
ahead of the main crack. At first such cracks initiate so close to the main crack that they
are overtaken by it. Eventually the initiation of new cracks is sufficiently far ahead of
the main crack that they can accelerate to a velocity whereby they are no longer over-
taken. Branching then occurs.

   Evidence for this explanation has been provided by experiments on brittle materials.
In particular, the observation of roughening of the surfaces of the main crack shortly be-
fore branching is evidence that new cracks initiate ahead of the main crack and are at
first overtaken by it.

   Crack branching can be promoted by the finite geometry of specimens. This effect
has its origin in the maximum crack velocity being less than the velocities of waves in
the material. Shock waves caused by impact loading and/or dynamic crack growth
travel faster than the crack. The shock waves reflect from the back surface of a speci-
men. On arriving back at the crack tip the shock waves suddenly increase the stress in-
tensity factor. This often causes multiple branching: excellent examples are sometimes
provided by broken window panes.

11.3 Basic Principles of Crack Arrest

   Like dynamic crack growth, crack arrest can be considered in terms of an energy bal-
ance. In the first instance one might consider the problem of crack arrest as an energy
rate balance, such that the crack stops if G somehow decreases below R. If R is constant
this criterion is exactly the reverse of that for unstable crack extension (cf. section 4.5).
The situation for plane strain conditions is depicted schematically in figure 11.3.a.

   However, for some materials it is very probable that R is not constant but depends on
the crack velocity. The reason is as follows. The material in front of a fast running crack
will be loaded at very high strain rates, and for strain rate sensitive materials the yield
strength increases with increasing strain rate. In turn, a higher yield strength decreases
the amount of crack tip plasticity and hence R, which is mainly plastic energy. In this
case the energy rate balance criterion for crack arrest is as depicted in figure 11.3.b.

   The energy rate balance criterion is in fact an oversimplification. In section 11.2 it
was argued that excess energy after instability is converted to kinetic energy. If this ki-
netic energy can be used for crack propagation the situations given in figure 11.3 are no
longer valid, and the problem must be solved by equating the total amounts of energy
and not just energy rates. This is shown schematically in figure 11.4 for plane strain
conditions. Note that for a strain rate sensitive material (situation in figure 11.4.b) R will
increase as the arrest point is approached. This is because the decrease in kinetic energy
will be accompanied by a decrease in crack velocity and hence lower strain rates and a
lower yield strength ahead of the crack.

   Although it is inconceivable that all the kinetic energy of a fast running crack is
available for crack propagation, the situations shown in figure 11.4 are generally con-
sidered representative of actual crack-arrest behaviour in many materials, since they are
qualitatively consistent with experimental results.

   A potentially important consequence of crack arrest depending (approximately) on a
balance of total energies is that the value of G at arrest is not a material constant, since it
will depend on the variation of both G and R with crack length and velocity. This is ex-
emplified in figure 11.5, which shows that even for the same maximum value of G and a
constant R, the value of G at arrest can be clearly different for different initial (and
hence final) crack lengths. This problem will be mentioned again in section 11.4 in
terms of the static stress intensity factor at crack arrest.

The Practical Significance of Crack Arrest

The foregoing considerations, even though qualitative, are sufficient to demonstrate that
crack arrest in a structure can occur if the energy release rate, G, decreases and/or the
crack resistance, R, increases.

   A decrease in G is obtained if

· the crack grows into a decreasing stress field, as in the case of wedge loading (see
   section 5.4);

· the load causing instability is transient and decreases with time;
· part of the load on the cracked element is taken up and transmitted by other structural

   elements: this is also referred to as load shedding by the cracked element.
   A simple example of the load being taken up and transmitted by another structural
element is given in figure 11.6. This shows a cracked plate with a bolted-on arrest strip.
As the crack approaches, the arrest strip increasingly resists the normal displacement of
the crack flanks. Consequently, part of the load on the plate is taken up and transmitted
by the arrest strip, as indicated schematically in figure 11.6.b. This principle is much
used (in a more sophisticated way) in aircraft structures, and serves the dual purpose of
arresting fast running cracks and slowing down fatigue crack growth. More information
on this subject is given in reference 3 of the bibliography to this chapter.
266  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

 Figure 11.6. Cracked plate with bolted on arrest strip.

   Another crack-arrest configuration, this time for a pipeline, is shown in figure 11.7.
The arrest of fast running cracks in pipelines is extremely important. It has been known
for fast fractures in gas pipelines to run for kilometres, with disastrous consequences.
Pipeline fracture is further discussed in section 11.4.

   An increase in a material's crack resistance, R, is not easily obtained. The only possi-
bility that has practical significance is to dimension the structure such that instability
would be accompanied by a change from plane strain to plane stress conditions. This
would result in a rapidly rising R-curve (see section 4.6) which could soon cause crack
arrest even if G continued to increase. This is shown schematically in figure 11.8.

   There are other possibilities of increasing R. They have very limited applicability.
Examples are direct insertion of strips of laminated material or strips of a material with
much higher fracture toughness (and usually a much lower yield strength). These possi-

bilities are feasible for weldable materials, but apart from technical difficulties there is a
major manufacturing problem, since to be truly effective the strips must be spaced fairly
close together.

11.4 Fracture Mechanics Analysis of Fast Fracture and Crack Arrest

   Fracture mechanics analysis of fast fracture and crack arrest is a highly specialised
topic, and a comprehensive treatment of the subject is beyond the scope of this course.
Instead we shall make some general remarks concerning the two main problem areas,
pipelines and thick-walled pressure vessels, for which dynamic fracture and crack arrest
must be considered.

Pipelines
As mentioned in the previous section, the arrest of fast running cracks in pipelines is
extremely important, since fast fractures have been known to run for kilometres. The
problem is especially severe for gas pipelines, for the following reason. When a gas
pipeline fractures the gas depressurises rapidly to cause a decompression shock wave
travelling at the speed of sound (| 400 m/s) in the gas. If the fast fracture in the pipe is
able to travel faster than the decompression shock wave (as is quite possible) the crack
tip continues to run in fully loaded material and there is no chance, without crack-arrest
rings, for crack arrest to occur.

   On the other hand, if a liquid-filled pipeline breaks open the pressure will drop faster,
since the decompression shock wave travels at a higher speed (e.g. 1500 m/s). The drop
in pressure will cause a decrease in the load acting on the pipe wall and consequently a
decrease in G of the crack. This decrease may well be sufficient for a running crack to
arrest.

   Early studies of the fast fracture problem in pipelines were based on the assumption
that the crack arrest will occur at a characteristic stress intensity (see reference 4 for
more detailed information). However, the problem is currently viewed in terms of a dy-
268  Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

namic energy balance. In general terms, crack propagation continues as long as

     Gdyn(a,t) > R(a· ) ,                                                       (11.10)

where t denotes time and

              d                                                                 (11.11)
     Gdyn = da (F  Ua  T) .

Equation (11.11) differs from the expression for the static energy release rate, G, cf.
equation (4.17), by the addition of a kinetic energy term, dT/da.

   Practical application of a dynamic energy balance criterion to fast fracture of a gas
pipeline requires the following aspects to be considered:

· the work done by the pressurised gas on the pipe walls as they crack;
· the contribution of kinetic energy to crack growth;
· the inertia of the pipe walls that have already cracked;
· the decrease of gas pressure owing to leakage;
· the effect of the large amount of plastic deformation of the pipe walls behind the

   crack tip (the pipe walls bend outwards, see figure 11.9);
· possible constraint of the plastic deformation of the pipe walls owing to the pipe be-

   ing covered by soil (generally called "backfill").

 Figure 11.9. Schematic of fast fracture in a pipe.

   In reference 5 a simplified (but still complex) expression for the dynamic energy re-
lease rate was obtained with the assumption of `steady state' crack propagation, i.e.
Gdyn independent of crack length and dependent only on time and hence crack velocity.
The variation of Gdyn with crack velocity was calculated using equation (11.11). An ex-
ample is given in figure 11.10.a, showing that Gdyn strongly depends on crack velocity.
For this particular example Gdyn reaches a maximum value | 6.4 MJ/m2 when there is
no soil coverage. Thus if the pipe material has a minimum crack resistance, Rmin, of 6.5
MJ/m2 it is not possible for fast fracture to achieve a steady state of continuing crack
propagation: i.e. if fast fracture somehow initiates it will arrest, even when crack-arrest
rings are not used.

Figure 11.10. a) Gdyn calculated as a function of crack velocity, after reference 5;
                  b) KID measured as a function of crack velocity for a pressure vessel steel.

   If it is at all possible to calculate Gdyn for a fast fracture situation, then it is evidently
important to obtain data for the dynamic crack resistance, R(a·), or the equivalent dy-
namic fracture toughness, KID(a·). Note that as in the static case (section 4.8) we can ex-

press the dynamic crack resistance curve in terms of stress intensity factors. The crite-

rion  for  crack  arrest  is  that  Gdyn  becomes  less  than  Rmin  or  that    dyn  becomes  less  than

                                                                               KI

the minimum in the variation of KID with crack velocity, usually denoted as KIm. Figure

11.10.b shows that KID and hence R can strongly depend on crack velocity. Estimates of
KID are possible by assuming that during steady state crack propagation Gdyn = R(a·) and

that

           §KID·2 R(a·) Gdyn                                                                   (11.12)
           ¨ ¸= = ,
           © KIc ¹ GIc GIc

where Gdyn follows from equation (11.11), the solution of which, however, requires a
complete dynamic analysis of the fracture problem. Alternatively, instead of a cumber-
some evaluation of KID for different crack velocities, a measure for KIm can be deter-
mined directly by experiment. This is discussed in section 11.5.

   In fact, for steel pipelines the problem is generally solved in a more empirical way.
The energy release rate, Gdyn, is correlated with the energy, CV, of conventional Charpy
impact tests carried out above the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature (figure 1.2).
The minimum crack resistance required for a pipeline steel is then expressed as a mini-
mum required Charpy energy, CVmin.

   Correlations between Gdyn and CV have no physical background, but they are used
because the Charpy Impact test is still the most common method of determining a
steel's resistance to brittle fracture. The correlations are carried a step further by estab-
lishing empirical relations between CVmin and the main parameters, besides the crack
velocity, that determine the maximum value of Gdyn. These parameters are the pipe ra-
dius, R, wall thickness, B, and line pressure, P.

   Several empirical relations for CVmin exist. Examples are
270                       Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

(ref. 5)      CVmin   =   3  .  3  6  ·  1  0  4  (  V  1.  5·  R0  .  5 )  ,                                                       (11.13)

                          ©B                                                B¹

In these equations CV is expressed in Joules; VH in Pa (= N/m2); and R and B are in mm.
VH is the hoop stress (= PR/B) in the pipe. Such empirical relations seem to work rea-
sonably well. Nevertheless, there has been much investigation of actual dynamic frac-

ture toughness with a view to improving the understanding and hence prediction of

crack arrest.

Thick-Walled Pressure Vessels

Besides pipelines, dynamic fracture and crack arrest are also of concern for thick-walled

(nuclear) pressure vessels, but with major differences. The critical cracks to be consid-

ered are part-through cracks growing from the inside surface of the pressure vessel wall.

An example has been given in section 2.8. Cracks may become unstable owing to ther-

mal shock (unusually rapid cooling within the pressure vessel) whereby high tensile

stresses are induced at the inside surface of the wall.

It is essential that the cracks stop soon after instability so that wall penetration does

not occur. The main reason why crack arrest is possible is the steep negative stress gra-

dient through the wall to the outside surface. An increase in fracture toughness due to a

lesser amount of radiation damage can be an additional factor in a nuclear pressure ves-

sel.

Since there is only a very limited amount of permissible dynamic crack growth, the

cracks will not have much kinetic energy. This fact is reflected in one of the methods

developed to analyse dynamic fracture in pressure vessels steels, the "crack-arrest

toughness" approach of Crosley and Ripling (reference 7).

Crosley and Ripling assert that when the amount of unstable crack growth is very

limited the dynamic effects on stress intensity can be neglected. If this is the case, then

the   calculated  static  stress            intensity           factor,           stat  for   a   crack  that  has  just  arrested  should

                                                                                KIa

be a reasonable approximation to the actual stress intensity at crack arrest. For this con-

cept  to  be  useful  it  has   to       be    demonstrated                     that    stat  is  approximately     constant  within  the

                                                                                      KIa

appropriate range of crack lengths and velocities, and that there is in fact little differ-

ence  between       stat  and   the         value       of    dyn           at  crack   arrest,     dyn

                  KIa                                       KI                                    KIa .

For several years there has been considerable controversy over the appropriateness of

the static approach advocated by Crosley and Ripling. In particular, Kanninen and co-

workers (e.g. reference 2) suggest that a dynamic energy balance approach should be

used. The controversy has led to much effort in determining dynamic fracture toughness

in order to compare the static and dynamic approaches to crack arrest.

Kalthoff et al. (reference 8) have made a summary comparing the results of the static

and dynamic approaches in a three-dimensional graph, shown in slightly modified form

in figure 11.11. The KI versus crack length curves are schematic for the situation of

crack arrest in a double cantilever beam specimen (DCB), but this does not detract from

DCB specimens the difference is significant, but for crack-line wedge-loaded specimens

(CLWL) the difference is usually small.

                                                     KIa

     growth is very limited, as it has to be in pressure vessels. (Thus the potentially im-

     portant  variation        in  Garrest,  and  hence     stat    illustrated     in  figure  11.5    is  not  significant

     instability. A higher KIi means a higher initial crack driving force. This results in a

     higher crack velocity and more kinetic energy, so that if dynamic effects had been

     significant     the  constancy    of      stat  would    not   have   been     observed.

much simpler to use a static value of the stress intensity factor than to carry out a dy-
namic analysis.

11.5 Determination of the Crack-Arrest Toughness

   To determine the crack-arrest toughness of a material a running crack must be cre-
ated that experiences either an increasing fracture toughness, a decreasing stress inten-
sity or a combination of both during its growth. In the past several types of specimen
have been used, including double cantilever beams with and without taper (DCB and
TDCB), single edge notched plates (SEN) and crack-line wedge-loaded specimens
(CLWL). Extensive experimental and analytical work resulted in a preference for the
CLWL arrangement shown in figure 11.13, for the following reasons:
· wedge loading, rather than pin loading, limits dynamic energy exchanges between

   specimen and testing machine;
· the CLWL specimen is relatively economical of material: this is an important con-

   sideration for high toughness materials like pressure vessel steels, since large speci-
   mens are normally required;
· the amount of side grooving to ensure an in-plane fracture path is much less than that
   for DCB specimens.
   Even though the CLWL specimen is relatively economical of material, the require-
ment of an initial stress intensity factor well above the arrest value would mean impos-
sibly large specimens for high toughness materials. This problem has been approached
in two ways, illustrated in figure 11.14. In one case a CLWL specimen similar in shape
to that shown in figure 5.17 has a brittle weld bead at the tip of the crack starter slot (see
reference 9). The other specimen type is duplex, with crack initiation occurring in a
hardened steel starter section welded onto the test material (see reference 10). Both

                  ness testing.

types of specimen have a blunt starter notch, so that the stress intensity to initiate
cracking will be higher than the arrest value. Furthermore, side grooves are applied in
order to prevent the formation of shear lips (see section 3.6) and restrict crack branch-
ing.

Test Procedure

In 1988 ASTM published a standard test procedure, designated E 1221, for deter-

mining crack-arrest toughness for ferritic steel, see reference 11. Only an outline of the

test procedure and analysis will be given here. This determination follows a static ap-

proach,  i.e.  the  crack-arrest  toughness,  now  conveniently  denoted  as  KIa,  is  in  fact    stat

                                                                                                  KIa

(see section 11.4), since it is calculated using the load and crack length immediately af-

ter arrest.

The procedure is based on the arrangement shown in figure 11.13 and uses the

specimen shown on the left-hand side of figure 11.14 (although the specimen on the

right-hand side may also be used). The specimen thickness, B, is either equal to the

thickness used in the application or sufficient to create a plane strain condition (see be-

low). The side grooves on each side should be B/8 deep.

The load exerted by the wedge on the specimen cannot be measured directly. Instead,

both the load applied to the wedge as well as the crack-mouth opening displacement are

monitored during the test. Wedge-loading can be done at a relatively slow rate, so that

recording the load signal from the testing machine and the displacement from a clip

gauge mounted on the specimen is not a problem.

To initiate unstable growth followed by arrest a cyclic loading procedure is used: this

requires some special attention. First the specimen is loaded to a pre-determined dis-

placement. Assuming the crack has not yet initiated, the specimen is then unloaded.

This leads to a certain zero-load displacement offset, which can be due to local cracking
274        Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

                  ness testing.

in the weld, notch-tip plasticity and/or seating of fixtures or clip gauge. Subsequently
the specimen is reloaded to a somewhat higher displacement value. This whole se-
quence of loading and unloading is repeated until the crack actually shows temporarily
unstable growth.

   The calculation of both the initial stress intensity, KIi, and the crack arrest value, KIa,
(described below) are based on the displacement excluding 50% of the zero-load dis-
placement offset accumulated during the load cycles. This percentage is more or less ar-
bitrary, since the effect of these phenomena on KI are not completely clear. For exam-
ple, seating of fixtures and local cracking should not be included. On the other hand, re-
sidual stresses due to plasticity may to some extent provide a driving force once the
crack has grown through the plastic zone.

   After the test the crack length at arrest, aarrest, must be measured. Since the speci-
mens are fairly thick (B | 50 mm) the through-thickness crack length must be measured
and averaged. This can be done via heat tinting. The cracked but unbroken specimens
are heated in a furnace to discolour the fracture surfaces by oxidation. Subsequently the
specimens are broken open and the crack lengths measured directly.

   For the calculation of KIi the initial crack length, ao, and the displacement at initia-
tion are used, while a candidate value for KIa, KQa, is evaluated using aarrest and the dis-
placement at arrest. The latter will generally be slightly larger than the displacement at
initiation and should be measured within 100 milliseconds after crack arrest. This is to
avoid measuring a slow increase in displacement due to time-dependent behaviour.

   Both KIi and KQa are now calculated using the relation given in the ASTM standard,
i.e.

           E G B/BN § a ·

   For the candidate arrest value to be qualified as a linear elastic plane strain value,
KIa, a number of checks must be made. The unstable crack growth must be larger than
twice the slot width, N (cf. left-hand side of figure 11.14), and exceed the plane-stress
plastic zone size at initial loading, i.e.

11.6 Determination of Dynamic Stress Intensity Factors

   Calculation of dynamic stress intensity factors, KIdyn, is a very difficult problem that
has had only limited success. Consequently, actual determination usually involves a
combination of experimental measurements and analysis. Either a direct or indirect
method of determination can be used.

   In a direct method the crack tip characterising parameters are measured during fast
crack propagation and require high speed photography to record instantaneous positions
of fast running cracks. Two such methods suitable for metallic materials are
· the shadow optical method of caustics in reflection, reference 8,
· dynamic photo-elasticity of birefringent coatings on specimens, reference 12.

   An indirect method uses information on crack growth history obtained from meas-
urements, for example by applying timing wires broken by the advancing crack, see ref-
erence 13. Afterwards an analysis of the advancing crack using numerical techniques,
for example a finite element method, can be used to calculate fracture characteristics
such as the dynamic stress intensity factor.

The Shadow Optical Method of Caustics

The physical basis of this method is illustrated in figure 11.15 for the case of a transpar-
ent cracked specimen illuminated by parallel light. Owing to the stress concentration at
276              Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

the crack tip the specimen will locally contract and the refractive index will change. As
a consequence the incident light will be deflected outwards during transmission. The
overall effect is to produce a shadow spot bounded by a bright ring (the caustic) on an
image plane at any distance behind the specimen.

   A similar effect is obtainable from a non-transparent (e.g. metallic) specimen acting
as a mirror. In this case the light being reflected forms an analogous shadow spot and
caustic when observed in a virtual image plane behind the specimen.

   In both transmission and reflection arrangements the shadow spots for fast running
cracks can be recorded by a high-speed camera focused on the appropriate image plane.
The instantaneous dynamic stress intensity factor for a running crack is then obtained
from

         dyn  =  F(a·)   M  D5/2  ,                                                      (11.19)

       KI

where D is the diameter of the caustic; F(a·) is a factor accounting for the crack velocity

dependence of the shadow spot and is | 1 for typical fast fractures; and M accounts for

specimen thickness, elastic and optical properties, and the distance between the speci-
men and the image plane. More details on the values of F(a·) and M are given, for ex-

ample, in reference 14.

Using  this  technique   Kalthoff    et  al.  (reference  8)  have  obtained    dyn  versus  crack

                                                                              KI

length curves for a number of materials, including a high strength steel. The results en-

abled them to indicate the general trend shown in figure 11.11.

A variation of the shadow optical method of caustics is the method of projection on

the focal plane. This method was first proposed by Kim, see reference 15, and has the

advantage relative to the original method that it does not require high speed photogra-

phy for monitoring the stressed state. The initially parallel light rays transmitted through

a transparent fracture specimen (or reflected from the surface of an opaque specimen)

are focused by a converging lens. The real-time stress intensity factor variation, KI(t), of

a moving crack tip can be measured using a single, stationary photodetector. The prin-

ciple of the method is based on the fact that any variation in KI(t) leads to a change of
11. Dynamic Crack Growth and Arrest  277

the light intensity I(t) impinging on the photodetector located on the focal plane. The
following relation is derived:

I(t) = B KI(t)4/3                    (11.20)

in which B depends on the speed of the crack for dynamic KI measurements. For details
the reader is referred to reference 15.

Dynamic Photo-elasticity of Coatings on Specimens

This method is an extension of the study of dynamic crack growth in transparent bire-
fringent polymers. It has its basis in the fact that cracks and notches in birefringent
polymers give rise to characteristic patterns of isochromatic fringe loops, whose size
and shape can be analysed to derive the stress intensity factor when the loading condi-
tions and optical properties of the polymers are known. This is a highly specialised
topic: the interested reader is referred to e.g. reference 16 for information on such analy-
ses.

Figure 11.16. Schematic of birefringent coating on a crack-line wedge-loaded specimen
                  (CLWL). After reference 12.

   To use the method for studying fast fracture in metallic specimens a birefringent
coating is bonded on to a side surface as shown in figure 11.16 for a CLWL specimen.
(Note that the coating is not continuous. This eliminates uncertainty as to whether the
isochromatic pattern in the coating is influenced by fracture of the coating itself.) A dy-
namic fracture toughness test is then carried out in synchronisation with high-speed
photographic recording of the instantaneous crack length in the specimen and the asso-
ciated isochromatic fringe loops in the coating.

   For any recorded instantaneous crack length in the metallic specimen the dynamic
stress intensity factor is

where the subscripts c and m refer to coating and metallic specimen respectively, and
( KIdyn) c for the coating has to be obtained by the rather complex analysis of the iso-
278               Fracture Mechanics Concepts for Crack Growth

chromatic fringe loops. The factor B/BN is included in equation (11.21) because of the
use of side grooves to ensure an in-plane fracture path in the specimen.

Indirect  Method  for  Determination  of    dyn

                                          KI

This method of determination of the dynamic stress intensity factor uses a combined

approach in which the crack propagation is measured and subsequently used in a finite
element analysis to determine KIdyn. For this analysis it may be necessary to use special

techniques to describe the singularity at the crack tip and the fact that the tip is moving.

Furthermore, it can suffice to assume elastic material behaviour. However, for an ade-

quate description of the material behaviour it may also prove essential to include plas-

ticity in the analysis and, since strain rates become very high for fast running cracks, to

include the effect of strain rate on yield behaviour.

11.7 Approaches in Elastic-Plastic Dynamic Fracture Mechanics

   As was stated in chapter 6 on Elastic-Plastic Fracture Mechanics, the Crack Opening
Displacement (COD) and J integral concepts have been widely accepted as crack char-
acterising parameters. Extension of these parameters to dynamic fracture mechanics has
been investigated by several authors. Two examples will be given here.

Dynamic Crack Opening Displacement

For quasi-static elastic-plastic fracture the CTOD is given by the equation derived by
Burdekin and Stone, i.e. equation (6.28). Kanninen extended the COD approach to dy-
namic fracture mechanics by deriving an expression for the CTOD for a propagating
crack, see reference 17. This expression is also based on Dugdale's strip yield model. A
steady-state crack propagation is assumed, i.e. all relevant quantities, such as stresses
and displacements, are independent of time for a constant position relative to the mov-
ing crack tip. For a crack propagating with a speed a· the static CTOD value, equation
(6.28), is multiplied by the function L(a·) given by

                  1+Q § a· ·2 ­§ a· ·2½                              (11.22)

                  D(a·) ©C2¹ ¯© C1¹ ¿

          where C1 = longitudinal wave velocity in a plate assuming plane stress,

                  C2 = shear wave velocity,

                                                            §a·
          D(a·) = 4 1  ¨ ¸ 1  ¨ ¸  ®2  ¨ ¸ ¾ .

In the limit of a· o 0 the function L(a·) = 1, while it monotonically increases with a· until

it reaches infinity at the speed of Rayleigh waves.

Assuming a constant (critical) CTOD for a propagating crack, Kanninen used equa-

tion (11.22) to predict the crack velocity as a function of crack length. A reasonable

agreement was found with experiments on steel foil in tension.

Dynamic J Integral

The J integral has found widespread application in quasi-static elastic-plastic fracture
mechanics. This path-independent contour integral actually represents the energy re-
lease rate for cracks in nonlinear elastic material. Elastic-plastic material behaviour can
be adequately described only when unloading is absent or limited. The use of J is there-
fore restricted to crack growth initiation (chapter 7) or to a limited amount of stable
growth (chapter 8).

   Obviously J cannot be used to describe dynamic crack propagation in elastic-plastic
material since considerable unloading can be expected to occur. However, it will still
prove meaningful to consider the integral expression for the dynamic J in nonlinear
elastic material. Since a detailed derivation is beyond the scope of this course, only the
result will be given here.

   For a crack propagating in the x1 direction with a speed a· one can derive J as follows,
see e.g. reference 17:

               ·2 wUi wUi·  wUi ½     §·· ·2 w2ui· wUi

*                                  :

               where * = arbitrary contour surrounding the crack tip,
                      W = strain energy density,
                       U = mass density,

                   ui, u··i = displacement and acceleration respectively,
                       ni = outward-directed unit vector normal to *,
                      Ti = traction acting on *,
                      : = area bounded by *, but excluding an infinitely small area con-
                            taining the crack tip.

Note that for the static case, when both a· and ·u·i are zero, this expression reduces to
equation (6.29). The most striking difference compared with the static equation, how-
ever, is the fact that J in equation (11.23) is no longer expressed by a path-independent
contour integral only.

    This can be understood by realising that in dynamic situations stress waves will be travelling to and
from the crack tip. If a wave front has traversed one contour but not another, integrals evaluated along
these contours will generally not yield identical values. Actually J can be written in the form of a contour
integral only, but this contour must then bound an infinitely small volume around the crack tip. Obvi-
ously, such a formulation is impractical to perform calculations with, e.g. using the finite element method.

   For the special case of steady-state crack propagation (see under the previous sub-
heading) u·i = a· wui/wx1. Since now ·u·i = a· wu·i/wx1 = a·2 w2ui/wx12 the area integral in
equation (11.23) vanishes and J can be conveniently evaluated only by using data at
some distance from the running crack tip, i.e. along *.

   Although the dynamic J cannot be used to describe crack propagation in elastic-
plastic material, it can be used up to the point of initiating crack growth. By equating a·

Thus besides the usual contour integral expression, cf. equation (6.29), an integral over
the area included by the contour must also be considered to account for the dynamic ef-
fects when evaluating J up to the point of initiating crack growth.

   Note that a standard test method which actually uses the dynamic J integral has not
yet been developed.

Mechanisms of
Fracture in Metallic
Materials

12.1 Introduction
   Since World War II there has been great progress in understanding the ways in which

materials fracture. Such knowledge has proved essential to better formulation of fracture
mechanisms. Nevertheless, it is still not possible to use this knowledge, together with
other material properties, for predicting fracture behaviour in engineering terms with a
high degree of confidence.

   Some insight into the problems involved is given in chapter 13, and it is the intention
of the present chapter to provide the necessary background information on fracture
mechanisms.

   Metallic materials, especially structural engineering alloys, are highly complex. An

286  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

indication of this complexity is given by figure 12.1, which shows various microstruc-
tural features (not all of which need be present in a particular material) and also the two
main types of fracture path, transgranular and intergranular fracture. Of fundamental
importance is the fact that almost all structural materials are polycrystalline, i.e. they
consist of aggregates of grains, each of which has a particular crystal orientation. The
only exceptions are single crystal turbine blades for high performance jet engines.

   Before the various mechanisms of fracture are discussed some information will be
given in sections 12.2 and 12.3 on the following topics:

1) The instruments used in fractography, which is the study of fracture surfaces. In par-
   ticular, the use of electron microscopes will be mentioned.

2) The concept of dislocations (see figure 12.1). The nucleation and movement of dis-
   locations causes shear, i.e. slip, on certain sets of crystal planes, and the overall ef-
   fect of slip is plastic de formation.

   Sections 12.412.7 cover specific aspects of transgranular and intergranular fracture,
namely

· transgranular fracture:
    ductile fracture by microvoid coalescence
    brittle fracture (cleavage)
    fatigue crack initiation and growth

· intergranular fracture:
    grain boundary separation with microvoid coalescence
    grain boundary separation without microvoid coalescence.

Finally, in section 12.8 some of the types of fracture that can occur owing to sustained
loading at elevated temperatures (creep) or in aggressive environments (e.g. stress cor-
rosion cracking) will be discussed.

12.2 The Study of Fracture Surfaces

   Fracture surfaces exhibit both macroscopic and microscopic features, the study of
which requires a wide range of magnification and a diversity of instruments, figure 12.2.

Figure 12.2. Approximate ranges of magnification for instruments used to study fracture sur-
                faces and microstructure.
12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials  287

Macroscopic examination should always be done first. This can be done with the un-
aided eye or a hand lens, and is often sufficient to indicate the directions in which
cracks have grown and the locations of crack origins. Also, it is sometimes possible to
distinguish immediately between fatigue and overload failures and whether the fracture
is relatively recent. Older fracture surfaces tend to be discoloured owing to corrosion.

   If the location of a crack origin is known, a stereo microscope is most useful for
seeing whether there are special features associated with the origin. When this has been
done the electron microscopes have to be used, especially the scanning electron micro-
scope, which has a large depth of field and can be used from low to high magnifications.
The scanning electron microscope has, in fact, virtually replaced the optical microscope
for direct examination of fracture surfaces. However, the optical microscope is indis-
pensable for metallography, including polished and etched cross-sections through frac-
ture surfaces and cracks. An example is given in figure 12.3.

                  lograph, ×320.

   The use of electron microscopy is essential for determining the types of fracture with
certainty. This is because characteristic, identifying features are often revealed only at
magnifications | × 1000 or higher. Since the use of electron microscopes is somewhat
specialised, the principles of their operation will be discussed briefly here.

The Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
The transmission electron microscope came into routine use in the 1950s. Broadly
speaking, it can be compared to a photographic enlarger, using an electron beam and

electromagnetic lenses instead of light and optical lenses.
   Figure 12.4 gives a schematic of a TEM. Note that the electron beam passes through

the specimen in the microscope (like light through the negative in an enlarger). Elec-
trons can pass through a material thickness of only a few tens of nanometres (1 nm =
12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials  289

109 m). This means that the specimen must be very thin. For fractography it is there-
fore necessary to make a thin film-type replicate specimen of the actual fracture surface.
A technique for preparing fracture surface replicas is illustrated in figure 12.5. The rela-
tively thick copper grid is required to support the replica and enable its insertion in the
TEM.

   The advantages of the TEM for fractography are that fracture surface details can be
studied at very high magnifications (see figure 12.2) with good resolution and high
contrast. Disadvantages include the time and skill required to prepare good replicas, the
obscuring of about 50% of the replica by the supporting copper grid, and the fact that
the replicas cannot be larger than a few millimetres in any direction.

The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)

The scanning electron microscope is a later development than the TEM and came into
routine use in the late 1960s. The operating principle of a SEM is completely different
from that of a TEM.

   Figure 12.6 gives a schematic of a SEM. The electron beam is highly focused by two
condenser lenses and impacts the specimen as a small spot. The impact results in the
generation of various forms of radiation, figure 12.7, of which the backscattered and
secondary electrons are important for image forming.

   The backscattered and secondary electrons come from different zones near the sur-
face of the specimen, as shown in figure 12.8. The secondary electron emission zone is
much smaller than the zone for backscattered electrons. Consequently, higher resolu-
290  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

tions are obtained from images formed by secondary electron collection, amplification
and display (see figure 12.6) and it is this secondary electron mode of operation that is
normally used for fractography.

Figure 12.6. Schematic of a SEM.
Figure 12.7. Signals generated by an electron beam impacting the specimen in the SEM.
12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials  291

 Figure 12.8. Zones in a specimen that are sources for signals generated by an electron beam
                  impacting the specimen.

   Actual operation requires the electron beam to scan rapidly back and forth in a sys-
tematic manner over the specimen surface. This is achieved using scanning coils in an
objective lens, see figure 12.6. The scanning coils are controlled by a raster scan gen-
erator, which simultaneously controls the deflection coils of the cathode ray tube dis-
play. In this way the signal from the electron collector is displayed in the same pattern
as it was generated by the electron beam impacting the specimen.

   The relative intensities of the generated secondary electrons form an image of the
specimen. Magnification in the SEM is changed by keeping the display size constant
and changing the area of specimen scanned. Typical magnifications for fractographic
studies range from × 10 to × 20,000, see figure 12.2.

   The main advantages of using a SEM for fractography are that the specimen is obser-
ved directly and the image has a realistic three-dimensional appearance. Also, modern
microscopes can accommodate fairly large specimens with maximum dimensions 100
mm. These advantages have made the SEM the preferred instrument for fractography,
despite the better resolution of the TEM. However, both instruments should be used for
fracture surface examination, especially when service failures are involved, in order to
maximise the chance of identifying characteristic features of different types of fracture.

12.3 Slip, Plastic Deformation and Dislocations
   The most common form of plastic deformation is slip. This is the shearing of whole

blocks of crystal over one another, see figure 12.9. Thus plastic deformation is intrinsi-

Figure 12.10. Slip owing to movement of pure edge and pure screw dislocations.

cally inhomogeneous. Slip always occurs by displacement of blocks of crystal in spe-
cific crystallographic directions on particular sets of crystal planes called slip planes.
When slip occurs on several sets of crystal planes in each grain of a polycrystalline ma-
terial the overall result is plastic deformation that is effectively homogeneous. This is
why fracture mechanics concepts, which are based on continuum behaviour, can be used
to describe many aspects of crack extension and fracture in structural materials.

   The displacement of crystal blocks does not occur simultaneously over the entire slip
plane. Instead it occurs consecutively, beginning in a very small region on the slip plane
and spreading outwards. The boundary between the regions where slip has and where
slip has not occurred is called a dislocation and is commonly represented as a line in the
slip plane. The two basic types of dislocation and slip displacements associated with
them are shown in figure 12.10. When the displacement is perpendicular to the disloca-
tion line it is called an edge dislocation. If the displacement is parallel to the dislocation
line it is of the screw type. In practice, most dislocation lines are neither pure edge nor
pure screw but are mixtures of the two.

   Note the symbol is used for an edge dislocation. This symbol and its inverse repre-
sent the fact that an edge dislocation can be depicted as an extra half plane of atoms that
lies above ( ) or below ( ) the slip plane and moves parallel to it. Figure 12.11 is an
idealised atomistic picture of an edge dislocation with the extra half plane of atoms
above the slip plane. The displacement b is called the Burgers vector. It is constant
along the dislocation line, both for edge and screw dislocations. From figure 12.10 it
follows that b is perpendicular to an edge dislocation line and parallel to a screw dislo-
cation line.

Figure 12.11. Idealised representation of an edge dislocation.
12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials  293

Figure 12.12. A screw dislocation in a simple cubic lattice. After reference 1.

   A screw dislocation does not have an extra half plane of atoms associated with it.
The representation of screw dislocations is more difficult than that for an edge disloca-
tion: a simplified example is shown in figure 12.12.

   As mentioned earlier, most dislocation lines are neither pure edge nor pure screw.
Furthermore, the boundary between slipped and unslipped regions often takes the form
of an enclosed loop, which must be partly edge and partly screw. Such loops are illus-
trated in idealised form in figure 12.13. These loops are identical, and show that the re-
lation between a dislocation and its Burgers vector is not entirely unique. The Burgers
vector is ambiguous in sign unless the slipped region is specified. Also note that the
screw and edge components of each loop are of opposite sign. This is because b is eve-
rywhere the same for each loop, while the screw and edge components move in opposite
directions to each other. For example, the material at A is compressed (extra half plane
of atoms above the slip plane, ) but at B the material is extended (missing a half plane
of atoms above the slip plane, which is equivalent to an extra half plane of atoms below
the slip plane, ).

Figure 12.13. Identical dislocation lines (loops) bounding slipped and unslipped areas.

   There are stress fields associated with dislocations, and they behave as if subject to a
line tension. This tension contracts a dislocation line and may collapse a loop unless
there is an applied stress large enough to keep it open or even expand it, thereby causing
slip.

   The stress required to move a dislocation depends on a number of factors, including
its character (edge and screw components), its detailed configuration in the crystal lat-
tice, the presence of other dislocations, each with its own stress field, and barriers such
as intermetallic particles and precipitates which do not fit into the crystal lattice. In
polycrystalline materials grain boundaries are major barriers to dislocation movement.
This is because the slip directions in neighbouring grains are generally different, and

then a dislocation cannot pass from one grain to another without changing its Burgers
vector, which is a high energy process.

   Because there are barriers to dislocation movement, the spreading of slip within a
grain and from grain to grain requires either that the dislocations cut through or bypass
the barriers, or else that other dislocations are activated. In fact, both processes can oc-
cur within a grain, but it is the activation of other dislocations that enables slip to spread
from grain to grain. The way in which this occurs is shown in figure 12.14. Dislocations
nucleated by some distant source (usually another dislocation) in a slip plane of grain A
are obstructed by the grain boundary, resulting in a dislocation pile-up. The pile-up
pushes the lead dislocation hard against the boundary, such that there is a high stress
concentration. Eventually the concentration of stress is sufficient to activate a disloca-
tion source for slip in grain B, which plastically deforms to alleviate the stress concen-
tration.

   The foregoing discussion is a very brief introduction to the concept of dislocations.
For readers interested in a more extensive treatment there are several excellent books,
including the classic by Cottrell, reference 1 of the bibliography to this chapter.

12.4 Ductile Transgranular Fracture by Microvoid Coalescence

   Ductile fracture is caused by overload and, depending on the constraint, can often be
recognised immediately from macroscopic examination of a failed specimen or compo-

12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials  295

nent. If there is very little constraint there will be a significant amount of contraction
before failure occurs. Figure 12.15 shows two fractured specimens after Charpy Impact
testing. One failed in a ductile manner, the other was brittle. The difference is easily ob-
served owing to the lack of constraint in this type of specimen.

   However, when there is high constraint (e.g. thick sections) a ductile fracture may
occur without noticeable contraction. In such cases the only macroscopic difference is
the reflectivity of the fracture surface, which tends to be dull for a ductile fracture and
shiny and faceted for a brittle fracture.

   On a microscopic scale most structural materials fail by a process known as micro-
void coalescence, which results in a dimpled appearance on the fracture surface. An ex-
ample is given in figure 12.16, which shows both small and large dimples.

   Dimple shape is strongly influenced by the type of loading. This is illustrated in figure
12.17. Fracture under local uniaxial tensile loading usually results in formation of equi-
axed dimples. Failures caused by shear will produce elongated or parabolic shaped dim-
ples that point in opposite directions on matching fracture surfaces. And tensile tearing
produces elongated dimples that point in the same direction on matching fracture surfaces.

   The microvoids that form dimples nucleate at various internal discontinuities, the
most important of which are intermetallic particles and precipitates and grain bounda-
ries. As the local stress increases the microvoids grow, coalesce and eventually form a
continuous fracture surface. A schematic of how a crack extends by microvoid forma-
tion at particles is given in figure 12.18. Note that voids can initiate both at ma-
trix/particle interfaces and as a result of particle fracture. Also, large particles are nu-
cleation sites for large voids, and small particles result in small voids.
296  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

Figure 12.17. Dimple formation owing to uniaxial tensile loading, shear and tensile tearing.

   There are several dislocation models for void nucleation and growth. A model by
Broek (reference 2) is illustrated in figure 12.19. The first step is the generation of dis-
location loops around particles. The edge and screw components of such loops are of
opposite sign. This is obvious for the screw components, which surround the particle by
moving in opposite directions. However, it is less obvious for the edge components. The
reasoning is as follows. Being of opposite sign the screw components will attract each
other, and it is possible for them to link up and reform the original edge dislocation ( ,
extra half plane of atoms above the slip plane) if a segment of edge dislocation of oppo-
site sign ( , extra half plane of atoms below the slip plane) is left to complete the loop.

   As the number of piled up loops increases, the leading loops are pushed to the ma-
trix/particle interface and a void is nucleated. Since there are actually many pile-ups on
different slip planes, once a void is nucleated it can grow by assimilating dislocations
from these pile-ups.

298  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

   Quantitative analysis of dislocation models of void nucleation and growth is an ex-
tremely difficult problem. Drastic simplifications are usually necessary, so that the use-
fulness of the models is very restricted.

12.5 Brittle Transgranular Fracture (Cleavage)

   A truly brittle fracture is caused by cleavage. The term brittle fracture can be mis-
leading, since essentially ductile fracture (microvoid coalescence) under high constraint
may show the same lack of contraction expected for cleavage.

   Cleavage generally takes place by the separation of atomic bonds along well-defined
crystal planes. Ideally, a cleavage fracture would have perfectly matching faces and be
completely flat and featureless. However, structural materials are characteristically
polycrystalline with the grains more or less randomly oriented with respect to each
other. Thus cleavage propagating through one grain will probably have to change direc-
tion as it crosses a grain or subgrain boundary (subgrains are regions within a grain that
differ slightly in crystal orientation). Such changes in direction resulted in the faceted
fracture surface shown in figure 12.15.

   In addition, most structural materials contain particles, precipitates or other imper-

Figure 12.20. Typical features associated with cleavage.
12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials  299

fections that further complicate the fracture path, so that truly featureless cleavage is
rare, even within a single grain or subgrain. The changes of orientation between grains
and subgrains and the various imperfections produce markings on the fracture surface
that are characteristically associated with cleavage.

   Figure 12.20 illustrates some typical features associated with cleavage. A principal
feature is river patterns, which are steps between cleavage on parallel planes. River
patterns always converge in the direction of local crack propagation. If the grains or
subgrains are connected by a tilt boundary, which means that they are misoriented about
a common axis, the river patterns are continuous across the boundary. But if adjacent
grains or subgrains are axially misoriented, i.e. they are connected by a twist boundary,
the river patterns do not cross the boundary but originate at it. Besides river patterns a
distinct feature of cleavage is feather markings. The apex of these fan-like markings
points back to the fracture origin, and therefore this feature can also be used to deter-
mine the local direction of crack propagation.

Figure 12.21. Cleavage in BS4360 structural steel. SEM fractograph, × 900.

   Cleavage occurs in a number of materials, but it is especially important because it
occurs in structural steels. An example is shown in figure 12.21.

   Knott's book on fracture mechanics (reference 3) reviews dislocation models of
cleavage with particular attention to steels, including a model by Smith (reference 4)
that incorporates the important microstructural feature of grain boundary carbides,
which are known to greatly influence the fracture toughness of steels.

   Smith's model is shown in figure 12.22. As a consequence of a tensile stress a brittle
intergranular carbide is subjected to a concentrated shear stress ahead of a dislocation
pile-up of length d, the average grain size. The effective shear stress, Weff, is the maxi-
mum stress that can be attained before yielding occurs, i.e. before the stress concentra-
300          Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

tion due to the pile-up is relieved by the spreading of slip to a neighbouring grain. The
condition for cracking the carbide is

     Weff t     4EJc                                              (12.1)
             (1  Q2)Sd .

Once the carbide is cracked there are two possibilities:

1) Weff is high enough to propagate the carbide crack into the ferrite matrix, that is:
   cleavage of the matrix is nucleation controlled. For this to happen the condition is

     Weff t     4EJp                                              (12.2)
             (1  Q2)Sd .

2) Weff at yielding lies between the limits set by equations (12.1) and (12.2). This is
   much more likely. In this case the carbide thickness, co, gives the size of initial crack
   in a Griffith-type energy balance criterion for crack extension:

     2 §co· 2 § 4 Wi       co·  2  4EJp

     Vf ¨ d ¸ + Weff ¨1 +   ¸      t (1  Q2)Sd ,                  (12.3)
     ©¹      © S Weff      d¹

   where Vf is the critical stress for cleavage fracture and Wi is a so-called friction stress,
   which includes a number of factors that cause the crystal lattice to resist dislocation
   movement.

Equation (12.3) shows that larger carbides should result in a lower cleavage fracture
stress, as is observed. The model has been tested quantitatively, and gives good predic-
tions of Vf for steels with large grain sizes. However, it is difficult to check the model
for fine grained steels, since fine grains are invariably associated with thin carbides, i.e.
carbide size variation is not possible.
12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials  301

12.6 Transgranular Fracture by Fatigue

   Fatigue results in very distinctive fracture appearances. In general there are three dif-
ferent features that can be observed:

· the location of fatigue initiation
· the fracture surface resulting from fatigue crack growth
· the final fracture due to overload.

Each of these features can give specific information about the fatigue process in a
structural component.

   Fatigue initiation nearly always occurs at an external surface, though there are im-
portant exceptions like jet engine compressor discs where internal fatigue origins have
been found. Careful examination of a fatigue initiation site may reveal the cause of fa-
tigue, for example stress concentrations due to a notch, machining grooves or corrosion
pitting. This kind of information is of primary importance for analysis of service failures
but is less relevant to fracture mechanics studies, although in recent years the problem
of short crack growth at notches (see section 9.8) has received widespread attention.

Figure 12.23. Beach markings on a fatigue fracture surface in a thin walled pipe. Optical fracto-
                  graph, × 5.

   Fatigue fracture surfaces tend to be macroscopically flat and smooth, and will often
show `beach markings', which occur owing to variations in the load history. An exam-
ple is given in figure 12.23.

   Beach markings can be very useful, since they give information about the shapes of
the fatigue crack front at various stages of growth, and these shapes are diagnostic for
the type of fatigue loading. Some typical beach markings for different types of loading
imposed on a cylindrical bar are indicated schematically in figure 12.24. Many more
examples are presented in reference 5 for both cylindrical and rectangular cross-
sections.

   The area of final fracture (shown hatched in figure 12.24) gives an indication of the
magnitude of the loads. A large final fracture area indicates that KIc or Kc was exceeded
at a relatively short crack length, which means that either the maximum load was high
or the fracture toughness low, or both. Knowledge of a material's fracture toughness
removes the ambiguity, and providing the crack geometry is not too complex a fair es-
timation of the maximum stress at failure can be obtained from an approximate expres-
sion for the stress intensity factor.

   On a microscopic scale the most characteristic features of fatigue are the striations
that occur during region II (continuum mode) crack growth, see figure 9.4. The stria-
tions represent successive positions of the crack front. Each striation is formed during
one load cycle but, especially under variable amplitude loading, not every load cycle
need result in a striation.

   Figure 12.25 shows two different examples of fatigue striations. Aluminium alloys
generally give well-defined regular striations, but steels do not. Besides the influence of
type of material, the environment also has a strong effect on striation appearance. Note
that striations are perpendicular to the local direction of crack growth. This is sometimes
helpful in tracing crack growth backwards in order to determine the exact location of
fatigue initiation.

   Since each striation is formed during one load cycle the spacing between striations is
an indication of local crack growth rates, particularly if it is evident from their regularity
that they have been formed by constant amplitude loading (typical examples are pro-
pellers, helicopter rotor blades and rotating components in power generating equip-
ment). These local crack growth rates can be used to determine the fatigue stresses pro-
vided the following procedure is possible:

   the fatigue stresses.

   Micromechanistic modelling of fatigue is a subject of considerable interest and

12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials                                             305

speculation, especially concerning fatigue striations. There does, however, appear to be
a fairly consistent picture of fatigue crack initiation at an external surface.

   Under fatigue loading the surface material tends to deform by cyclic slip
concentrated in so-called persistent slip bands (PSBs) with irregular notched profiles
consisting of extrusions and intrusions. As figure 12.26 shows, this slip distribution is
quite different from that produced by monotonic loading.

   Continuing cyclic slip leads to deepening of the intrusions and eventually the forma-
tion of a crack along the slip plane. This slip plane cracking may extend a few grain dia-
meters into the material, but then changes to a continuum mechanism of crack propaga-
tion.

   A simple dislocation model for the formation of extrusions and intrusions is shown in
figure 12.27. The dislocations pile up at a grain boundary and tend to form pairs (di-
poles) owing to interaction of their stress fields. An arrangement of vacancy dipoles
means that the material between them has fewer half planes of atoms than the matrix:
these half planes have been transported beyond the surface to form an extrusion. On the
other hand, an arrangement of interstitial dipoles means that the material between them
has more half planes of atoms than the matrix, and this results in an intrusion.

   The dislocation arrangements within a PSB are actually much more complicated than
those assumed by the model in figure 12.27. Nevertheless, analysis of the model pre-
dicted the form of observed relations between fatigue initiation life and cyclic plastic
strain and between grain size and fatigue strength in some materials, reference 6.

   Various models of fatigue striation formation have been proposed. Most consider
only plastic flow at the crack tip and ignore the potential contribution of the environ-
ment. One such model, the plastic blunting process, is shown in figure 12.28. During
uploading shear deformation concentrates at first at `ears' on either side of the crack tip.
Later the crack tip itself advances and blunts. During unloading the shear deformations

Figure 12.28. The plastic blunting model of fatigue striation formation. After reference 7.
306  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

are such that a new pair of ears is formed at the crack tip, thereby producing the char-
acteristic striation marking on the fracture surface. Why this ear formation should hap-
pen during unloading has never been explained. However, it does appear to occur in
both inert and aggressive environments, reference 8.

12.7 Intergranular Fracture

   Intergranular fractures are typically the result of sustained load fracture, discussed in
section 12.8, or a lack of ductility in the material owing to segregation of embrittling
elements and particles and precipitates to the grain boundaries, for instance in temper-
embrittled steels and overaged Al-Zn-Mg-Cu aluminium alloys.

   It is not possible to distinguish macroscopically between intergranular fracture and
brittle transgranular fracture: both appear faceted. However, metallographic cross-
sections through fracture surfaces and cracks will show whether the fracture path is in-
tergranular, see for instance figure 12.29.

Figure 12.30. Intergranular fracture with and without microvoid coalescence. SEM fractographs,
                  top × 1400, bottom × 500.

   There are two main types of intergranular fracture appearance:

1) Grain boundary separation with microvoid coalescence. This type of intergranular
   fracture occurs during overload failure of some steels and aluminium alloys, and also
   other materials.

2) Grain boundary separation without microvoid coalescence. This type of intergranular
   fracture occurs during overload failure of temper-embrittled steels and refractory
   metals like tungsten, and also during sustained load fracture (creep, stress corrosion
   cracking, embrittlement by hydrogen and liquid metals).

Examples of both types are given in figure 12.30. The dimples on the grain boundary
facets are the main distinguishing feature of intergranular fracture with microvoid coa-
lescence.

   Intergranular fractures are not always readily identifiable. Figure 12.31 shows sche-
matically an intergranular fracture along flat elongated grains, which often occur in
rolled sheet and plate materials as a consequence of mechanical working. This type of
intergranular fracture exhibits few grain boundary junctions and is relatively featureless.

12.8 Types of Sustained Load Fracture

   In this section we shall first consider the characteristics of creep fracture, which is
primarily a plasticity-induced mechanism of fracture at elevated temperatures, and then
some examples of sustained load fracture induced by aggressive environments.

Creep Fracture
At temperatures in excess of 0.5 Tm (the melting point of a material in Kelvin) time-
dependent deformation and rupture (creep) is a primary design consideration. In many
applications, such as gas turbines and steam boilers, the operating temperature is limited
by the creep characteristics of materials.

   Creep fractures in most commercial alloys are intergranular. There are two forms of
intergranular separation, depending on the load and temperature:
1) At high loads and low temperatures in the creep range the fractures tend to originate

   at grain boundary junctions (triple points), rather than on the boundaries.
2) At lower loads and higher temperatures (the typical creep situation) fracture results

12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials  309

   more from the formation of voids along grain boundaries, especially those bounda-
   ries perpendicular to the loading direction. This process is called cavitation.

The initiation of both types of creep fracture is illustrated schematically in figure 12.32.
The fracture surface of a high loadlow temperature creep fracture consists of inter-
granular facets without microvoid coalescence, and is similar in appearance to the lower
fractograph in figure 12.30.

   On the other hand, the fracture surface of a low loadhigher temperature fracture will
often exhibit voids on the grain boundary facets. These voids can be observed from a
metallographic section, or even by optical microscopy of a replica from a polished sur-
face. (Surface replicas are widely used to assess creep damage in large structures such
as steam pipes in power generating plants.) The grain boundary voids can coalesce to
resemble dimpled rupture, as in the upper fractograph in figure 12.30, but they can also
coalesce in very distinctive patterns. An example of such patterns is shown in figure
12.33.

   Nucleation of creep voids most probably occurs by a combination of grain boundary
sliding, in which the grain boundary behaves like a slip plane, and stress-assisted diffu-
sion and agglomeration of lattice vacancies. At triple points grain boundary sliding re-
sults in geometric incompatibilities (and hence stress concentrations) which can be ac-
commodated by vacancy diffusion to nucleate voids. On the grain boundaries the voids
are nucleated by vacancy diffusion, especially to matrixparticle interfaces, and grain
boundary sliding can assist this process.
310  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

   There is less certainty as to the controlling mechanism of void growth and coales-
cence to fracture, which is a very complicated process. A fairly recent attempt to resolve
the inconsistencies in earlier creep fracture models is due to Edward and Ashby, refer-
ence 9. They proposed that void growth on cavitated grain boundaries occurs by va-
cancy diffusion at a rate controlled not by the stress but by deformation of uncavitated
material surrounding the voids.

Sustained Load Fracture in Aggressive Environments

Important kinds of sustained load fracture in aggressive environments include:

· stress corrosion cracking
· cracking due to embrittlement by internal or external (gaseous) hydrogen
· liquid metal embrittlement.

   The term stress corrosion cracking covers a very wide range of materialenviron-
ment interactions, and it is not possible to give more than a brief overview of some pro-
posed fracture mechanisms here. For the interested reader a good background to the
subject is provided by references 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the bibliography to this chapter.
An important update is provided by reference 14.

   Stress corrosion fractures can be transgranular or intergranular. Sometimes they are a
mixture, though one mode usually predominates. Macroscopically transgranular stress
corrosion cracks are often faceted. On a microscale the fracture surface may show a
feather-shaped appearance as in figure 12.34 or can strongly resemble mechanical
cleavage (see figure 12.21) as in aqueous stress corrosion of titanium and magnesium
alloys.

                  tenitic stainless steel. SEM fractograph, × 500.

Figure 12.35. Classification of some types of stress corrosion and models suggested to explain
                  them. See reference 14 for an update.

   In fact, the cleavage-like appearance has led to models of environment-induced
cleavage owing to adsorption of specific ions, for instance hydrogen, at the crack tip or
to hydrogen absorption followed by internal decohesion which links up with the main
crack.

   A classification of stress corrosion cracking models proposed for some structural
materials is given in figure 12.35. The fact that different models have been suggested to
explain each type of failure is an indication of the complexity of stress corrosion crack-
ing. A short description of each model follows.

   The film rupture model is also sometimes called the slip dissolution model. The
model is illustrated in figure 12.36. Emergent slip bands at a surface or crack tip break a
passive film and the crack propagates owing to local dissolution of metal.

   The stress-assisted intergranular corrosion model is sometimes called the brittle
film mechanism. It is shown in figure 12.37. The model requires the environment to
produce a mechanically weak surface film that grows preferentially along grain bounda-

Figure 12.36. The film rupture model of stress corrosion cracking.
312  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

Figure 12.37. The stress-assisted intergranular corrosion model.

ries and eventually cracks under stress. The crack is arrested by plastic deformation of
the metal, which then reacts with the environment to reform the film, and so on.

   The tunnel model was proposed specifically for transgranular cracking of austenitic
stainless steels in order to explain the typical feather-shaped appearance shown in figure
12.34. It involves the formation of arrays of corrosion tunnels at slip steps as depicted in
figure 12.38. As the tunnels grow the ligaments of metal between them become more
highly stressed and eventually fail by ductile rupture. The process is then repeated.

Figure 12.38. The tunnel model of stress corrosion cracking.

   The adsorption model is a general one proposing that an environmental species can
interact with strained crystal lattice bonds at the crack tip to cause a reduction in bond
strength and hence brittle crack extension. There are many objections to the applicabil-
ity of this model for stress corrosion. It has enjoyed some popularity for explaining em-
brittlement by gaseous hydrogen and liquid metals, but even these possibilities now ap-
pear to be unlikely, as will become evident from the remainder of this section.

   The hydrogen absorption + decohesion theory of stress corrosion cracking involves
stress-assisted hydrogen diffusion to a location ahead of the crack tip. The increased hy-
drogen concentration at this location then results in cracking that links up with the main
crack. This model, or a modification of it, may be valid for a number of material envi-
ronment combinations. In the next chapter, section 13.4, it is shown that the model can
12. Mechanisms of Fracture in Metallic Materials       313

be used to quantitatively predict stress corrosion crack growth rates for high strength
steels.

   Embrittlement by internal or external hydrogen also occurs in a wide range of ma-
terials. It is particularly important for steels, and also for high strength nickel-base al-
loys, titanium alloys and materials used in the nuclear power industry (zirconium, haf-
nium, niobium, uranium).

   Most hydrogen embrittlement fractures are intergranular, but cleavage-like cracking
can also occur, especially if transgranular brittle hydrides form and act as crack nuclea-
tion sites. Besides hydride formation in the material, hydrogen can remain in the lattice
and interact with dislocations and other lattice defects, including segregation to ma-
trix/particle interfaces. Hydrogen may also react to give surface hydrides that lower the
fracture stress at crack tips, or else these surface hydrides form brittle films along grain
boundaries such that the type of mechanism shown in figure 12.37 applies. In short, hy-
drogen embrittlement is no one thing. For further reading references 13, 14, 15 and 16
may be consulted.

   Because of its importance much attention has been paid to quantitative analyses of
hydrogen embrittlement in high strength steels. As in the case of stress corrosion these
analyses will be discussed in the next chapter, section 13.4. The results of the analyses
indicate that both external and internal hydrogen embrittlement are caused by lattice de-
cohesion ahead of the main crack, in a similar manner to stress corrosion cracking of
high strength steels.

   The final topic in this section is liquid metal embrittlement. Again this is a wide-
spread phenomenon. It is usually of much less practical significance than stress corro-
sion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement, but the most recently proposed mechanism
is very interesting since it could have more general applications.

   Liquid metal embrittlement results in drastic losses in macroscopic ductility. The
fracture path can be intergranular or transgranular, and consists of facets that appear
very brittle at low and intermediate magnifications (up to | × 1000). Because of this, it
was for a long time thought that liquid metal embrittlement was due to adsorption of
liquid metal atoms at the crack tip and a consequent reduction in crystal lattice bond

strength so that brittle crack extension occurs. The model proposed on this basis is
shown in figure 12.39. (This model is essentially the same as that suggested, and now
largely discounted, to account for stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittle-
ment.) The hypothesis is that adsorbing atoms lower the tensile stress, V, required to
break lattice bonds, but do not influence the shear stress, W, necessary to move disloca-
tions to cause plastic deformation and crack tip blunting.

   Subsequently, however, Lynch (references 17, 18) has shown that the apparently
brittle fractures caused by liquid metal embrittlement are in most cases covered by
shallow microvoids. An example is given in figure 12.40. This shows macroscopically
brittle `cleavage' in an aluminium single crystal and a TEM replica fractograph of part
of the fracture surface. The microscopic ductility is considerable. In view of this micro-
scopic ductility Lynch proposed that adsorbing liquid metal atoms facilitate the nuclea-
tion and egress of dislocations near the crack tip. This causes slip at lower stress levels
than would be required in an inert environment. These lower stresses activate fewer
dislocations ahead of the crack leading to less crack tip blunting. The overall effect is a
highly localised concentration of slip and hence much less total plastic deformation
during crack extension.

   As visualised by Lynch, actual crack extension generally occurs by a combination of
intense local shear and microvoid formation and coalescence with the main crack, see
figure 12.41. This mechanism, with or without microvoid coalescence, may be applica-
ble to other environments besides liquid metals, and to environmental fatigue crack
growth as well as sustained load fracture.

The Influence of
Material Behaviour
on Fracture
Mechanics Properties

13.1 Introduction
   In this final chapter we shall provide some insight into the ways in which the actual

behaviour of materials influences the fracture mechanics parameters used to describe
crack extension. Most of the discussion concerns LEFM parameters, mainly because
they are more widely used. Figure 13.1 lists the various types of fracture considered in
this course and the relevant fracture mechanics parameters. At present a significant
contribution by EPFM is made only in the case of fracture toughness and slow stable
tearing.

   The influence of material behaviour on fracture mechanics characterization of crack
extension will be described in sections 13.213.4 as follows:
(13.2) The effects of crack tip geometry:

· blunting
· branching and kinking
· through-thickness irregularity
· change of mode.

· transgranular and intergranular fracture; mixed fracture paths
· effects of microstructure

    particles and precipitates
    grain size
    fibering and texturing owing to mechanical working.

(13.4) Fracture mechanics and the mechanisms of fracture:

· fracture by microvoid coalescence
· cleavage in steels
· fatigue crack growth
· sustained load fracture
· superposition or competition of sustained load fracture and fatigue.

   This subdivision is convenient in that the subjects are presented more or less in the
order of increasing complexity. However, they are often strongly interrelated, as will be
seen.

13.2 The Effects of Crack Tip Geometry

   LEFM analysis begins with slit-shaped, unbranched cracks of zero tip radius. The
latter assumption is obviously unrealistic, owing to the occurrence of plasticity which
blunts the crack. Also, most real cracks exhibit at least small amounts of branching,
kinking and through-thickness irregularity. These problems have been mentioned in
section 10.4.

   Changes in mode of loading can occur. The most important are the mode II o mode
I and mode I o combined modes I and II transitions during fatigue crack propagation at
low stress intensity levels.

13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 319

Crack Tip Blunting

Crack tip blunting always occurs in practice. The blunting may be very limited, e.g.
during environmental fatigue crack propagation and sustained load fracture in high
strength materials. In such cases sharp crack LEFM is usually adequate for characteriz-
ing crack extension.

   On the other hand, blunting is very important during EPFM fracture toughness test-
ing. This is recognised in the procedures for determining JIc (section 7.4) and COD
(section 7.6).

   As stated in section 2.2, the mode I elastic stress field equations for a blunt crack
were derived by Creager and Paris, reference 1 of the bibliography to this chapter. The
crack tip coordinate system is shown in figure 13.2.

       2Sr                             2Sr ©2r¹

For sharp cracks U is small. Unless one is interested in regions very close to the crack
tip the terms with (U/r) can be neglected and equations (13.1) reduce to the standard
form given in equations (2.24).

   Blunting has a minor effect on the size and shape of the plastic zone, reference 2.
However, for plane strain conditions the distribution of Vy ahead of the crack tip is
greatly altered, as figure 13.3 shows. A blunted crack tip acts as a free surface and lo-
cally reduces the triaxiality of the state of stress (at r = U/2 Vx = 0 for T = 0), see section
3.5. Thus increased blunting decreases the maximum stress and moves its location away

from the crack tip towards the elastic-plastic boundary. These effects have been used to

assess the effects of blunting on fracture toughness and sustained load fracture, as will

be discussed in section 13.4.

Crack Branching and Kinking

Microscopic crack branching and kinking commonly occur. Their significance is often
overlooked when the fracture mechanics-related properties of materials are determined.
Macrobranching also occurs, but only during region II sustained load fracture and dy-
namic fracture. The reason for this limitation is that macrobranching depends on there
being little or no tendency for one branch to outrun the other(s), and this is only possible
when crack growth rates are virtually independent of crack length and stress intensity,
as is the case for region II sustained load fracture, see figure 10.4, and for dynamic
crack branching, section 11.2.
320  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

 Figure 13.3. Schematic of the effect of crack tip blunting on Vy for an elastic-perfectly plastic
                  material under plane strain.

   Crack branching and kinking lower the mode I stress intensities at the crack tips.
This is illustrated in figure 13.4. Consequently, for nominally mode I crack extension it
may be expected that microbranching and kinking will result in
· higher fracture toughness
· higher thresholds for fatigue crack growth ('Kth) and sustained load fracture (KIth)
· lower crack growth rates in fatigue and region I sustained load fracture.

Through-Thickness Irregularity
Fracture mechanics analyses of through-thickness crack front irregularity are not avail-
able. Nevertheless, for both sustained load fracture (reference 4) and fatigue crack
growth (references 5 and 6) it has been found that increased irregularity results in lower
crack growth rates.

Change of Mode
Two types of change of mode of crack growth will be considered here:

322  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

similar transition occurs in fatigue, figure 13.5. Shear lips gradually develop as the fa-
tigue crack grows and the crack front becomes increasingly curved. The fracture plane
rotates from flat to slant with a component of mode III loading. As in the case of
monotonic loading, this fracture plane rotation is related to a change from predominan-
tly plane strain to plane stress conditions. However, a change in stress state is not the
only factor. The flat-to-slant transition is strongly dependent on the environment: more
aggressive environments postpone the transition.

                mode II to mode I.
        13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 323
   The flat-to-slant transition affects fatigue crack growth rates. Under constant ampli-
tude loading the slope of the fatigue crack growth rate curve will slightly decrease. Un-
der variable amplitude loading one or more tensile peak loads can induce a change from
flat to slant fracture, which then reverts to flat fracture under continued less severe load
cycling. Such crack front geometry changes are a potential complication for predicting
crack growth, since re-orientation of the crack front back to flat fracture is likely to af-
fect the amount of crack growth retardation due to the peak loads.
   The mode II o mode I transition during fatigue crack propagation is of fundamental
importance since it often represents the initiation and early growth of fatigue cracks un-
der constant or increasing stress cycling, 'V. Figure 13.6 gives a schematic of this proc-
ess as follows:
a) Cyclic slip begins in a surface grain and occurs mainly on one or a few sets of crystal
   planes.
b) This usually leads to slip plane cracking (mode II), which results in a faceted fracture
   surface, and spreading of cyclic slip to an adjacent grain. Again the slip is mainly on
   one or a few sets of crystal planes.
c) The second grain also cracks along the slip plane. Cyclic slip in the interior is now
   activated on several sets of crystal planes. This enables mode I crack extension.
d) Cyclic slip on several sets of crystal planes results in a continuum mechanism of
   crack propagation, often characterized by fatigue striations.
(For more details on fatigue crack initiation and propagation the reader is referred to the
previous chapter, section 12.6.)

                  mode II fatigue crack growth.
324  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

   The mode I o combined modes I and II transition is also important. It generally oc-
curs when a fatigue crack is growing at low stress intensity levels either when the over-
all 'K is gradually decreasing towards the threshold, reference 7, or else after a tensile
peak load, reference 8. In both cases faceted fracture (not necessarily slip plane crack-
ing) occurs and the crack path is effectively a series of kinked cracks. This means that
apart from a decreasing 'K or the effects of residual stresses due to a peak load there
are two purely geometric effects that contribute to lower crack growth rates:

1) The crack tip mode I stress intensities for kinked cracks are lower than those for pure
   mode I cracks, e.g. figure 13.4.

2) There is an increase in crack closure owing to increased contact of the fracture sur-
   faces. This is illustrated in figure 13.7.

13.3 The Effects of Fracture Path and Microstructure

   The effects of fracture path and microstructure on the fracture mechanics properties
of materials are based on geometric and inherent characteristics. More specifically, the
amounts of plastic deformation and energy required for crack extension depend on both
crack tip geometry and the fracture path. In turn, the fracture path is determined by the
microstructure and, sometimes, by microstructurally influenced material-environment
interactions.

   In this section we shall consider transgranular and intergranular fracture and mixtures
of different fracture paths before proceeding to the influences of microstructure.

Transgranular Fracture

Figure 13.8 lists important kinds of transgranular fracture, their occurrence and general
descriptions of their geometric and mechanical characteristics. The amount of energy
required for crack extension depends on these characteristics. At one extreme microvoid
coalescence, which is the usual way in which stable and unstable crack extension occur,
requires relatively high amounts of energy. On the other hand cleavage is a low energy
fracture.

   Transgranular fatigue and stress corrosion cracking require much less energy than
microvoid coalescence. The highly localised cyclic plasticity characteristic of fatigue is
very effective in causing crack growth, especially in an aggressive environment. In
stress corrosion the environment enhances fracture in some way. Two common sugges-
tions are dissolution of stressed material, and a reaction to give hydrogen which diffuses
into the material and embrittles it, see section 13.4.

Intergranular Fracture

Important kinds of intergranular fracture are listed in figure 13.9. The geometric char-
acteristics of intergranular fractures are broadly similar, namely branched and irregular
crack fronts with limited blunting. Intergranular fatigue fractures are usually less
branched and less irregular than other kinds of intergranular fracture, particularly stress
corrosion cracks.
        13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 325

 Figure 13.8. Important kinds of transgranular fracture.

   Intergranular fractures require only moderate to low amounts of energy, i.e. they are
generally a sign of weakness.
Mixed Fracture Paths
Combinations of different kinds of transgranular fracture and transgranular and inter-
granular fractures are common. For example, in high strength steels cleavage often oc-
curs as a secondary kind of fracture during fatigue or in combination with transgranular
and intergranular microvoid coalescence during unstable fracture.

   Since cleavage is a low energy fracture with sharp and fairly uniform crack fronts its
occurrence is always detrimental to the fracture mechanics properties. However, the
geometric and mechanical characteristics of some fracture paths can oppose each other,

Figure 13.9. Classification of intergranular fracture.
326  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

e.g.:

1) Intergranular microvoid coalescence causes a more irregular and branched crack
   front but the fracture toughness is lower when it occurs in combination with trans-
   granular microvoid coalescence.

2) Transgranular microvoid coalescence causes irregular and blunt crack fronts but ac-
   celerates constant amplitude fatigue crack growth when it occurs with fatigue stria-
   tions.

Figure 13.10. Some microstructural and microstructurally-related features in metallic materials.
        13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 327

   The first example is apparently straightforward. Fracture toughness is at least partly
determined by stable crack extension, see section 5.2. The limited local plasticity char-
acteristic of intergranular microvoid coalescence outweighs potential increases in frac-
ture toughness owing to branching and irregularity. Note, however, that this rationale is
incomplete: it does not explain why intergranular or transgranular fracture paths occur
or why they differ in energy. The second example is impossible to explain, even par-
tially, without a detailed consideration of the role of the microstructure.

   Both examples will be returned to in the discussion on mechanisms of fracture in
section 13.4, under the subheading "Fracture by Microvoid Coalescence".

Effects of Microstructure

There are many microstructural and microstructurally-related features that can play a
role in determining the fracture path. The most important are:

· second phases
· particles and precipitates
· grain size
· fibering and texturing owing to mechanical working.

   Figure 13.10 illustrates some of these features. Not shown are grain size variations
and texturing, which is a preferential orientation of crystal planes. Texturing is impor-
tant for two phase (DE) titanium alloys (D is hexagonal close packed, E is body centred
cubic).

   High strength structural materials usually possess several microstructural features
that can influence the fracture path and hence the fracture mechanics properties. The
fracture process is therefore often complex, and it is impossible to give an overall, uni-
fied description.

   Nevertheless, in figure 13.11 we have attempted a survey of microstructural influ-
ences on the fracture of high strength steels, aluminium alloys and titanium alloys,
which represent three of the four major classes of modern structural materials men-
tioned in chapter 1. The background to this survey is twofold:

1) Relationships between microstructure and fracture properties are better understood
   for aluminium alloys than for high strength steels and titanium alloys. A review is
   given in reference 9.

2) There are basic differences between the classes of materials. Titanium alloys contain
   very few particles and their fracture properties depend mostly on alloy phase mor-
   phology, relative amounts of D and E, and the texture.
   Particles are always present in high strength steels and aluminium alloys and have a
   major effect on fracture toughness, as will be discussed in section 13.4. Also, alu-
   minium alloys are essentially single phase while alloy phases are present only in
   small amounts in high strength steels, where they are much less important than in ti-
   tanium alloys.

13.4 Fracture Mechanics and the Mechanisms of Fracture

   The mechanisms of fracture in structural materials are incompletely understood. This
is particularly true for environmentally influenced crack growth, i.e. environmental fa-
tigue crack propagation and sustained load fracture.

   There have been many attempts to model fracture processes using fracture mechan-
ics. The models are necessarily based on continuum behaviour. Their successes  and
failures  can provide useful insight into the actual mechanisms of crack growth, and it
is this aspect of fracture mechanics that is considered in this final section.

   The topics that will be discussed are:
· fracture by microvoid coalescence
· cleavage in steels
· fatigue crack growth
· sustained load fracture
· superposition or competition of sustained load fracture and fatigue.

Fracture by Microvoid Coalescence

Transgranular microvoid coalescence is the typical process by which slow stable tearing
and unstable ductile fracture occur. As discussed in section 12.4, the microvoids nucle-
ate at various discontinuities. For steels and aluminium alloys the most important nu-
cleation sites are large particles and dispersoids. In titanium alloys the voids nucleate at
the boundaries between D and E phases.

    In titanium alloys microvoid nucleation, growth and coalescence to cause fracture is a highly complex
process that depends greatly on microstructure and anisotropic plastic deformation owing to texturing.
This process is not well understood and will not be discussed further. Interested readers should consult
references 10, 11 and 12 of the bibliography.

   A schematic of transgranular microvoid nucleation at particles and subsequent crack
extension was shown in figure 12.18 and is given again as figure 13.12. The voids can
initiate both at matrix/particle interfaces and as a result of particle fracture. Large parti-
cles provide weak spots for the nucleation of large voids, which link up to the crack and
each other via sheets of small voids nucleated at dispersoids. From this qualitative de-
scription two factors are evident:

1) Crack tip blunting is important. Blunting will be beneficial to fracture toughness
   since it lowers the maximum normal stress ahead of the crack, figure 13.3. Therefore
   void nucleation, growth and coalescence will require higher external stress.

2) The sizes and spacings of particles will greatly affect fracture toughness. Larger par-
   ticles and less distance between them will be detrimental.

These factors are interrelated. Crack tip blunting depends not only on the matrix ductil-
ity but also on the ease with which voids nucleate, grow and coalesce with the crack tip:
at that moment blunting ceases.

   The influence of particle spacing provides an explanation why intergranular micro-
void coalescence lowers fracture toughness and why fibering results in lower fracture
toughness when the crack plane is normal to the short transverse direction. In both cases
330  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

the fracture path contains relatively large numbers of particles, i.e. the distance between
them is small. However, it is the particle size which determines whether intergranular
microvoid coalescence will occur instead of transgranular microvoid coalescence. This
is demonstrated by the effect of overageing on unstable fracture in Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys,
mentioned in figure 13.11.

   The contribution of particles to transgranular microvoid coalescence makes it possi-
ble to explain why its occurrence accelerates high stress intensity constant amplitude
fatigue crack growth. During high stress intensity fatigue microvoid coalescence nucle-
ates at large particles ahead of the crack. Localized regions of material between the
crack tip and the particles also fracture by microvoid coalescence, as in figure 13.12.
This process causes rapid local jumps of the crack front such that the overall crack
growth rate increases even though the crack front is locally blunter and more irregular.

   Before proceeding to quantitative modelling of fracture toughness a very important
practical point that relates to microvoid coalescence will be discussed. It is difficult or
impossible to use the highest strength alloys of any material class for fracture resistant
structures. This is because there is a general trend for fracture toughness to decrease
with increasing yield strength, see figure 13.13. It is most unlikely that any single factor
is responsible for this trend. Nevertheless, fractography has shown that the diameters of
coalesced microvoids also decrease with increasing yield strength of a class of alloys,
and has led to the following simple explanation of the general decrease in fracture
toughness. Increasing strength raises the attainable stresses in the crack tip region, re-
sulting in earlier nucleation and growth of microvoids during loading and the nucleation
and growth of microvoids at many sites that are inactive in a lower strength alloy.

Figure 13.13. General dependency of fracture toughness on yield strength. After reference 9.

   Many attempts have been made to calculate the plane strain fracture toughness, KIc,
from other properties. There are several problems that such modelling faces:
1) Stress-strain distributions in the plastic zone ahead of the crack must be known or as-

   sumed. In this respect strain hardening is very important.
2) The proper fracture criterion must be chosen. Ductile rupture is strain controlled, i.e.

   the local strains must exceed a critical value. This is sometimes considered to be the
   uniform elongation strain in a tensile test, and in other cases is considered to be the
   fracture strain at the crack tip.
3) The critical strain has to be reached or exceeded over a certain distance or volume. A
   reasonable assumption is that this distance is equal to the particle spacing d. How-
   ever, there is a complication. The critical strain depends strongly on the stress state,
   which varies significantly near the crack tip.
4) Calculation of KIc is based on the assumption that unstable fracture occurs when the
   fracture criterion is satisfied. But actual determination of KIc involves 2% crack ex-
   tension which, if stable, can cause a significant increase in stress intensity, as men-
   tioned in section 4.8. Consequently, calculated and measured KIc values need not be
   comparable.
   In view of these problems it is no surprise that estimates of KIc are often very inaccu-
rate. One of the more reliable and yet simple models is a semi-empirical one due to
Hahn and Rosenfield, reference 13. Figure 13.14 illustrates the basic features of the
model. There is a region of intense plastic deformation in the vicinity of the crack tip.
The width of this region, O, depends on the strain hardening characteristics of the mate-

rial, represented by the strain hardening exponent n, cf. equation (6.32). The shear strain
at the crack tip is given approximately by

     J = . Gt/2                                                                (13.2)
         O(n)

                                                                                                     _
Two assumptions are now made. First, it is assumed that the average tensile strain, H, in
the region of intense plastic deformation is approximately J/2. Second, the strain distri-
bution is assumed to be linear. Then the maximum tensile strain at the crack tip is

     Hmax = 2H = J =     Gt     .                                              (13.3)
                                                                               (13.4)
                         2O(n)

At the onset of fracture Gt = Gtcrit, Hmax = H*f and O(n) = O(n)crit. Thus

     *Hf = Gtcrit     .

           2O(n)crit

   Hahn and Rosenfield measured O(n)crit for a variety of steels and aluminium and tita-
nium alloys. They found that O(n)crit | 0.025 n2 when measured in metres. Also, they
argued that the crack tip fracture strain, H*f, can be related to the true strain, Hf, in a ten-
sile test by H*f = Hf/3. Then

            0.05 Hf n2                                                         (13.5)
     Gtcrit = 3 .

   Experiments by Robinson and Tetelman (reference 14) have shown that under plane
strain conditions the relationship between Gt and KI tends to the value predicted by the
Dugdale approach (equation 3.20)

Substituting for Gtcrit and KIc in equation (13.5) gives

             3

Equation (13.7) was found by Hahn and Rosenfield to be accurate within 30% for
eleven different materials.

    The derivation of equation (13.7) given here is based on an analysis by Garrett and Knott, reference
15. Alternatively one can arrive at the same result by taking H*f = Gtcrit/Otcrit and Gt | KI2/2EVys, which is the
more widely quoted expression for the crack opening displacement under plane strain conditions.

   The model of Hahn and Rosenfield contains only macroscopic parameters. The in-
fluence of microstructure on fracture toughness is therefore only implicit (i.e. by its ef-
fect on these parameters) rather than explicit. An obvious extension of the model is to
incorporate the observed behaviour of microvoid nucleation and coalescence. This can
be done by specifying that the average strain over the distance d between particles must
equal H*f for fracture to occur. Then it appears that in order to obtain even very rough
agreement with experimentally determined KIc values the distance d must be con-
siderably less than O(n) and also less than Gtcrit. This is illustrated in figure 13.15.

   Several relationships between KIc, particle spacing and other material properties have
been derived. Schwalbe (reference 16) lists two of the more successful relationships as:

        Vys                     * 1+n           (13.8)

and                                             (13.9)
              KIc = 4.55(H*f + 0.23) d E Vys .

These equations illustrate that KIc depends in a complex way on other material proper-
334  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

ties. For example, as Vys increases one may expect H*f to decrease, and this decrease is
related to a decrease in the effective d (= microvoid diameter) owing to nucleation and
growth of microvoids at many more sites. As figure 13.13 shows, the overall result is a
trend of decreasing fracture toughness with increasing yield strength for each class of
material.

Cleavage in Steels

Cleavage in steels is responsible for the phenomenon of a transition temperature below
which brittle, low energy fracture occurs. Because of its great practical importance the
occurrence of cleavage has been the subject of much experimental and theoretical work.
Knott's book on fracture mechanics, reference 17, reviews the micromechanistic theo-
ries of cleavage (see also section 12.5) and a model for the dependence of fracture
toughness on temperature. This model uses a semi-quantitative description of cleavage
initiated at intergranular carbides ahead of the crack tip and will be discussed with the
help of figure 13.16. The model proposes that unstable fracture will occur when a criti-
cal fracture stress, Vf, is exceeded by Vy over a fixed, characteristic distance ahead of
the crack tip. The association of cleavage with cracking of intergranular carbides led
Knott and coworkers (reference 18) to choose one or two grain diameters as the charac-
teristic distance.

   The dependence of fracture toughness on temperature can be explained as follows.

Figure 13.16. Schematic of the critical fracture stress, Vf, and characteristic distance over which
                  it must be exceeded for unstable cleavage fracture to occur.
13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 335

At low temperatures the crack is sharp, the material yield stress is high, and little stress
intensification is required in order to exceed Vf over the characteristic distance. Conse-
quently, at failure the plastic zone size is small and KIc is low. At higher temperatures
the crack tip blunts, the material yield stress decreases, and more stress intensification is
required for failure, resulting in larger plastic zones and higher KIc values.

    Note that the stress intensification at higher temperatures can exceed 3Vys. This is because real materi-
als are not elastic  perfectly plastic. Instead crack tip blunting results in strain hardening, which can raise
Vy as high as 45 times the nominal yield stress, Vys. In other words, for real materials the plastic con-
straint factor, C, (discussed in section 3.5) can be greater than 3.

   The model shown in figure 13.16 appears to be broadly correct. There are, however,
two additional and important points:

1) Cleavage crack nucleation need not occur directly ahead of the crack, i.e. for T = 0°.
   This is because the highest values of Vy occur at T = 5070°, see figure 13.17.
   In fact, there is evidence that so-called `out-of-plane' cleavage does occur ahead of
   the main crack, reference 19.

2) The characteristic distance over which Vf must be exceeded by Vy is not simply re-
   lated to grain size (i.e. one or two grain diameters). Rather, the characteristic distance
   is a statistically based quantity depending on the volume of material that must be
   sampled in order to find a cracked carbide greater than the critical size for cleavage
   nucleation.

   Based on this model Curry (reference 20) has given a general expression for the
fracture toughness of steels when cleavage occurs:

       © ys ¹

where X is the characteristic distance, which must be determined empirically, and E is a
factor between 3 and 5 that expresses the maximum amount of stress intensification
near the crack tip in the actual material, i.e. E includes the effects of strain hardening

Figure 13.17. Variation of Vy with T according to equations (2.24).
336  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

and crack blunting.
   Equation (13.10) can be used to predict the cleavage-controlled fracture toughness of

a steel at different temperatures and with different microstructures provided that

· the dependencies of Vy and X on microstructure (principally grain size) are known;
· the dependencies of Vys and n on temperature and microstructure are known;
· the value of E can be estimated from elastic-plastic analysis of crack tip stresses;
· some KIc data are available as empirical checks on Vf and X.

These requirements restrict the predictive usefulness of equation (13.10) to steels for
which a substantial data bank already exists, for example mild steel.

Fatigue Crack Growth

In the previous chapter the mechanisms of fatigue crack initiation and propagation were
discussed in some detail and the concept of dislocation movement to cause slip was in-
troduced. This micromechanistic background is necessary to understanding some of the
attempts to model fatigue crack growth in fracture mechanics terms.

   There are three aspects of fatigue crack growth that will be considered here:

1) The fatigue crack propagation threshold, 'Kth;
2) Relations between cyclic plastic zone size, microstructure and regions I and II fa-

   tigue crack growth;
3) Prediction of continuum mode region II fatigue crack growth.

   1) The fatigue crack propagation threshold, 'Kth, depends markedly on

· the elastic modulus;
· the microstructure, especially grain size in steels, and phase morphology and texture

   in titanium alloys;
· the environment;
· the stress ratio, R.

   This list is discouraging. Nevertheless, some simplified models of the threshold con-
dition have achieved remarkably good agreement between prediction and experiment.
The models consider either critical fracture stresses and strains or critical shear stresses
for slip as the criteria for crack extension. In view of the tendency for near-threshold fa-
tigue crack growth to take place by a combination of modes I and II it seems reasonable
that either type of crack extension criterion could apply. We shall here discuss one
model of each type and then examine the usefulness of such models in understanding
the threshold condition.

   Yu and Yan (reference 21) suggested that at threshold the cyclic plastic strain, Hpc, at
a crack tip of finite radius, U, becomes equal to the true fracture strain, Hf. They assumed
that the reversed (i.e. cyclic) plastic zone is circular and its diameter, ryc, can be obtained
from the first order estimate of the monotonic plane stress plastic zone by substituting
'K for KI and 2Vys (reversed plastic flow) for Vys in equation (3.2), i.e.

Yu and Yan then assumed n = 1, which is true only for elastic straining. Then equation
(13.17) becomes

    'Kth = EHf 2SU .                                                            (13.18)

Equation (13.18) is supposed to be valid for R = 0 and a minimum crack tip radius, Umin,
which cannot be less than the Burgers vectors of the dislocations causing plastic defor-
mation. Umin turns out to be 0.250.29 nm (nanometres) depending on the material.

   Figure 13.18 compares the predictions of equation (13.18) with experimental values
of 'Kth for a wide variety of materials. The agreement is very good. This is remarkable
in view of the assumption that the cyclic plastic zone is circular. Actually it is nothing
of the kind, as figure 13.19 shows.

However, the major dimension of the actual cyclic plastic zone is close to the diameter
of the first order cyclic plastic zone. Specifically, from reference 22:

   ©Vys¹

Substitution of ryc(2) for ryc(1) in the analysis of Yu and Yan increases the predicted 'Kth
values by 1/ 0.83 = 1.1. The agreement is still good, and so it appears that the major
dimension of the cyclic plastic zone is more important than its shape.

    Note also that Yu and Yan suggested that the crack tip fracture strain is equal to Hf, the true fracture
strain in a tensile test, whereas Hahn and Rosenfield argued that for unstable crack extension, equation
(13.7), the crack tip fracture strain is Hf/3. This illustrates the uncertainties in the understanding of defor-
mation and fracture at crack tips.

   A very different threshold model is the dislocation model of Sadananda and Sha-
hinian, reference 23. A simplified version of the model is shown in figure 13.20. Since
fatigue crack growth is usually a consequence of plastic deformation by slip due to the
nucleation and movement of dislocations, it is assumed that the threshold condition cor-
responds to the minimum shear stress required to nucleate and move a dislocation from
the crack tip. Sadananda and Shahinian derived a general expression for this shear
stress. For a dislocation moving directly away on a slip plane with T = 45° the general
expression reduces to

W = 4S(1  Q) © µ ¨§ln b4r + r¹b¸· + b 2 Je + 2Vys ,                (13.20)

where µ is the shear modulus, Je is the surface energy and b is the Burgers vector. Now
for a sharp crack we can write from equations (2.24):

Figure 13.20. Schematic of dislocation emission from a crack tip.
340  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

     Wxy = KI sinT/2 cosT/2 cos3T/2 .                       (13.21)
              2Sr

For a dislocation to be nucleated at the crack tip Wxy should be at least equal to W and r
should be at least b. Hence the threshold condition is given by

                     W 2Sb                                  (13.22)
     KIth = sinT/2 cosT/2 cos3T/2 .

For R = 0 the quantity KIth can be replaced by 'Kth. Also, T = 45°. Then equation
(13.22) reduces to

     'Kth = 18.5W b                                         (13.23)

and for different R values Sadananda and Shahinian suggest

     'Kth = KIth(1  R) .                                    (13.24)

The model gives good agreement between predicted and experimental values of 'Kth,
although there is some uncertainty as to the actual values of surface energy, Je, for many
metals and alloys, and hence the value of W.

   Both of the models just described show that 'Kth depends strongly on the elastic
moduli (E or µ), in agreement with many experimental results and with other models.
Also, the cyclic plastic zone size is an important parameter. This is emphasized by a
model due to Taylor (reference 24) in which the cyclic plastic zone size is set equal to
the grain size and thereby allows reasonable prediction of the dependence of 'Kth on
grain size in steels.

   With insight provided by the models it is possible to explain the existence of fatigue
thresholds. Figure 13.21 is a schematic of how fatigue crack growth depends on the
relative sizes of the cyclic plastic zone and the grain size. When the cyclic plastic zone
is significantly larger than the grain size the high local stress concentrations induce slip
on several sets of crystal planes in each grain and also ensure that slip spreads across
barriers like grain boundaries. The plastic deformation is therefore homogeneous and
the fatigue crack propagates by a continuum mechanism.

   However, when the cyclic plastic zone size is less than the grain size the local stress
concentrations are sufficient to activate only one or a few slip planes. Microstructural
barriers then exert more influence on the spreading of slip to neighbouring grains, and
are assisted in this by the geometric effects of faceted modes I and II crack growth, i.e.
lower mode I stress intensities at the tips of kinked cracks and increased crack closure,
as discussed in section 13.2.

   Eventually the cyclic plastic zone size becomes so small compared to the grain size
that slip can no longer spread across microstructural barriers. The dislocations pile up
on the activated slip plane(s). This increases the resistance to dislocation emission from
the crack tip until no more are emitted: the fatigue threshold has been reached. Cyclic
slip can still occur, but is confined to to-and-fro movement of dislocations along the slip
       13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 341

plane as far as a microstructural barrier (typically a grain boundary, but in aluminium
alloys dispersoid particles may also act as barriers, reference 25).

   The foregoing explanation is mechanical and takes no account of the environment.
An aggressive environment usually lowers 'Kth, but sometimes there is little or no
change or even an increase in 'Kth. As mentioned in section 9.4, in some instances
(mainly for steels) an increase in 'Kth is due to corrosion contributing to crack closure,
i.e. the environmental effect is largely mechanical. The way this occurs is illustrated in
figure 13.22. In the near threshold region of crack growth there is an enhanced build-up
of corrosion product (oxide) on the crack surfaces close behind the crack tip. This oxide
build-up acts as a wedge and reduces the cyclic crack tip opening displacement Gtc,
which under plane strain conditions is approximately given by

                c    'K2
            Gt = 0.5 c ,                                                             (13.25)

        EVys

Irrespective of the exact value of the cyclic plastic zone size, ryc is directly proportional
to Gtc. Thus the oxide wedge reduces the cyclic plastic zone size and this is reflected in

an increase in 'Kth.

   2) The significance of the cyclic plastic zone size is not limited to the threshold con-
dition for fatigue crack growth. More recently it has become evident that there are also
relations between cyclic plastic zone size, microstructure and regions I and II fatigue
crack growth, depending on the type of material.

   Figure 13.23 schematically illustrates transitions in the fatigue crack growth rate
curves for steels and titanium and aluminium alloys. These transitions are as follows:

· For steels the region Iregion II transition point corresponds to the cyclic plastic
   zone size equalling the grain size.

· For titanium alloys a knee in the region II crack growth rate curve corresponds to the
   cyclic plastic zone size equalling the grain size.

· For aluminium alloys there appear to be at least three transition points. At the region
   Iregion II transition point (T1) the cyclic plastic zone size is approximately equal to
   the spacing between dispersoid particles. For the region II transition points T2 and T3
   the cyclic plastic zone size correlates with subgrain size and grain size respectively.
   (Subgrains are regions within a grain that differ slightly in crystal orientation with
   respect to each other. The boundaries between subgrains are dislocation arrays that
   are barriers to slip, though less effective than grain boundaries.)

   The transition points in steels and conventional titanium alloys represent a change
from faceted fracture at lower 'K to a continuum mechanism of crack propagation. This
is as expected from the correlation between the cyclic plastic zone size and the grain

13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 343

size at these transitions. However, for aluminium alloys the transition point T3 does not
correspond to a change from faceted to continuum-type crack growth. Instead, this
change occurs at T2, reference 29. A possible explanation is that even though the cyclic
plastic zone is smaller than the grain size below T3, the misorientations of the subgrains
cause slip to be fairly homogeneous. Only when the cyclic plastic zone is smaller than
the subgrain size, below T2, is slip confined to one or a few sets of crystal planes.

   3) Finally, we shall consider briefly the prediction of continuum mode region II fa-
tigue crack growth. Many empirical models have been formulated (see section 9.2) but
they do not contribute to understanding the crack growth process. Only a few attempts
have been made at absolute predictions of fatigue crack growth rates. The problems to
be faced are similar to those for modelling fracture toughness: stress-strain distributions
in the plastic zone ahead of the crack must be known or assumed, and the proper criteria
for crack advance must be chosen. In this respect all models are severely limited, since
they consider purely mechanical crack extension, i.e. environmental effects cannot be
accounted for. This point is often overlooked when model predictions are compared
with experimental data. Nearly always the data are for fatigue tests in air, which has a
strong environmental influence compared to vacuum or dry gases.

   The models fall into two main categories based on the criteria for crack advance,
which is assumed to occur during each load cycle by either

· Alternating shear at the crack tip, i.e. incompletely or totally irreversible slip on al-
   ternate sets of crystal planes.

· Exceedance of the true fracture strain over a certain distance.

   Alternating shear models predict relations of the form

da = C 'K2 ,      (13.27)
dn EVys

i.e. linear log-log behaviour with a slope m = 2. In fact m is rarely 2, nor is m always

constant during region II fatigue crack growing. Note that equation (13.27) predicts that
da/dn is inversely proportional to E. This relation is supported by experimental data. In
figure 13.24 the crack growth rate data of figure 9.6 are plotted as functions of 'K/E in-
stead of 'K. The widely varying crack growth rate curves for various materials are
brought together into a single (wide) scatterband.

   The simplest model is that of Pelloux, reference 30. In this model all the slip takes

place at the crack tip and contributes to crack advance, as shown in figure 13.25.

   It is evident that the crack advance, Ga, is one-half the cyclic crack tip opening dis-
placement, Gtc. Thus from equation (13.25) crack advance under plane strain conditions
is given by

     Gtc 'K2      (13.28)
Ga = 2 = c ,

where Ga is the crack advance per cycle, i.e. Ga = da/dn.
   Other alternating shear models allow only part of the slip to contribute to crack ad-

vance: the remainder causes crack blunting. Kuo and Liu (reference 31) proposed a

   Figure 13.26 compares the models of Pelloux and Kuo and Liu with data for two ti-
tanium alloys tested in vacuo, i.e. purely mechanical crack extension. The model of Kuo
and Liu is clearly in better agreement with the test data. This shows that slip in the crack
tip region mainly causes crack blunting. Only a small amount of slip contributes to ac-
tual crack advance.

   Of the models using a crack advance criterion based on true fracture strain, that of
Antolovich et al. (reference 32) provides the most insight into the mechanisms of region
II fatigue crack growth. The model will be discussed using figure 13.27, which shows
that the fatigue crack is assumed to be blunt and that within the cyclic plastic zone there
is a `process zone'. Note also that ryc is defined as the plane strain cyclic plastic zone

and E is the Coffin-Manson low cycle fatigue exponent, which usually lies between 0.4
and 0.6. Equation (13.32) shows that ryc is not taken to be proportional to ('K/Vys)2. This
is because crack tips in real materials are blunt to some extent. The parameter S ac-

counts for crack blunting, and in general is a small number | ±0.10.2.

    For a sharp crack S = 0, and the value of ryc can be obtained directly from equation (3.27) in chapter 3
by substituting 2Vys (reversed plastic flow) for Vys. The result is

   Equation (13.31) is the result of modelling crack growth in the process zone in terms
of low cycle fatigue. If S and E are known the equation can be fitted to actual data in or-
der to determine the process zone size, l. This acts as a check on the model: there
13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 347

should be a reasonable physical interpretation of l to support the assumption that con-
tinuum mode region II fatigue crack growth is the result of a low cycle fatigue process
occurring near the crack tip. In fact, l is about the size of dislocation cells, which are
polygonal arrangements of dense tangles of dislocations that form during both low cycle

fatigue and region II fatigue crack growth. The assumptions of the model therefore ap-

pear to be justified (for a more detailed treatment see reference 33).

Sustained Load Fracture

A comprehensive treatment of mechanisms of sustained load fracture is a forbidding
task well beyond the scope of this course. The discussion will be restricted to a few ex-
amples where fracture mechanics concepts have been used to study such mechanisms.
These examples are:

1) Time-to-failure (TTF) tests in modes I and III.
2) Cleavage during stress corrosion of titanium alloys.
3) Susceptibility of steels to hydrogen embrittlement.
4) Analysis and modelling of crack growth rates.

(1) The background to TTF testing in modes I and III is that sustained load fracture for
some material-environment combinations may occur by hydrogen embrittlement as a
result of diffusion of hydrogen to a location ahead of the crack. The increased hydrogen
concentration at this location then results in cracking that links up with the main crack.

   In such cases any factor that promotes hydrogen diffusion to a location ahead of the
main crack should increase the susceptibility to sustained load fracture. One possibility
is dilatation (three-dimensional expansion) of the crystal lattice owing to a state of hy-
drostatic stress, i.e. a state in which, strictly speaking, all three principal stresses are
equal. In the elastic stress fields of cracks the three principal stresses are not all equal to
each other, even in plane strain. However, it is convenient to split the triaxial stress state
into a hydrostatic component

        1                                                      (13.34.a)

Vh = 3 (V1 + V2 + V3)

and a stress deviator s                                        (13.34.b)
              s1 = V1  Vh , s2 = V2  Vh , s3 = V3  Vh .          (13.35)

From equations (2.33) and (2.43) in chapter 2 it follows that
       mode I plane strain Vh = 2(1 + Q)KI cos T/2 ,
                                        3 2Sr

mode III  Vh = 0 .                                             (13.36)

In other words, for mode I loading Vh reaches a maximum directly ahead of the crack,
but for mode III loading there is no hydrostatic stress component.

   Thus if stress-assisted hydrogen diffusion and embrittlement play a role in sustained
348  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

load fracture, then comparison tests in mode I and mode III should show differences in
susceptibility. This does, in fact, appear to be the case for stress corrosion cracking of
steels and aluminium and titanium alloys. An example is given in figure 13.28, which
shows that the susceptibility of a titanium alloy to stress corrosion cracking was consid-
erable in mode I but negligible in mode III.

   It should be noted that there are also hydrogen embrittlement models for which the
concentration of hydrogen in the crystal lattice does not depend on a hydrostatic stress
component, e.g. transport of hydrogen by dislocations or the hindering of dislocation
movement by hydrogen. In such cases there need not be any difference in susceptibility
under mode I and mode III loading.
(2) The concept of stress-assisted hydrogen diffusion and embrittlement has also been
examined with respect to D-phase cleavage during stress corrosion of titanium alloys,
reference 35. In highly textured alloys a mode I crack can be approximately parallel to
the cleavage planes in most grains. Under these conditions the stress corrosion fracture
path is very flat, i.e. cleavage occurs directly ahead of the crack. Figure 13.29 shows
that this is evidence for hydrogen embrittlement control of the cleavage location rather

than mechanical control, since Vh is a maximum directly ahead of the crack (T = 0°) but
Vy is a maximum at T = 65° Mechanical control would be expected to cause out-of-

plane cleavage, discussed earlier in this section with respect to steels (see the discussion
to figure 13.17).
(3) Apart from the more generally applicable TTF comparison tests in modes I and III,
fracture mechanics analyses of the susceptibility to sustained load fracture are con-
cerned mostly with hydrogen embrittlement of steels, an important practical problem.
For example, steel pipelines and pressure vessels are used for transport and storage of
hydrogen-containing environments, and power generating equipment may have to oper-
ate in a hydrogen atmosphere. These are examples where external hydrogen may be a
problem. Internal hydrogen, i.e. residual hydrogen within the metal, is also important,
especially for welds in high strength structural steel, and ultra high strength steels as
used in most aircraft landing gear and many other components where high strength is
essential.

                  mode I crack parallel to the cleavage planes in a highly textured titanium alloy.

   With respect to external hydrogen embrittlement, fracture mechanics stress field so-
lutions have been used to distinguish between two types of theory:
· The adsorption theory, which assumes that hydrogen is adsorbed at the crack tip and

   changes the surface energy of the crystal lattice, thereby lowering the crack resis-
   tance. The surface energy change, and hence the amount of embrittlement, depend on
   the external gas pressure.
· The absorption + decohesion theory. This is another name for stress-assisted hydro-
   gen diffusion ahead of the crack tip and the reaching of a sufficient concentration of
   hydrogen to cause cracking that links up with the main crack. The theory is applica-
   ble not only to hydrogen embrittlement per se, but also to stress corrosion of steels
   (discussed later in this section). Again, the external gas pressure determines the
   amount of embrittlement: higher pressure decreases KIth.
Details of the very complex analyses of external hydrogen embrittlement will not be
given here: reference 36 of the bibliography contains a comprehensive, though dated,
review. However, the results are important and appropriate:
 the adsorption theory fails to predict realistic KIth values;
 absorption + decohesion theories which require lattice decohesion to occur very
   close to the crack tip provide the best predictions of KIth as a function of external gas
   pressure.
The physical significance of the second result is that the experimental data with which
the models were compared must have been obtained from materials with sharp cracks,
such that the maximum value of Vh (and hence Vx, Vy and Vz) was well within the plas-
tic zone, compare figure 13.3. There is thus a clear correlation between crack tip sharp-
ness and the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. This agrees with the fact that
steels with higher yield strengths and less capacity for plastic deformation are more sus-
ceptible.
350  Mechanisms of Fracture in Actual Materials

Figure 13.30. Model for internal hydrogen embrittlement.

   Internal hydrogen embrittlement seems at first to be a different phenomenon from
external hydrogen embrittlement: after all, there is no apparent source of gaseous hy-
drogen. However, van Leeuwen (reference 37) has provided a model to show that the
absorption + decohesion theory can be applied to internal as well as external hydrogen
embrittlement. The model is illustrated in figure 13.30. Ahead of a notch or crack a mi-
crocrack forms by decohesion at the location of maximum hydrogen concentration. This
is also the location of maximum hydrostatic stress and the maximum value of Vy, CVys
(C is the plastic constraint factor, previously mentioned in this section with respect to
cleavage in steels).

   Formation of the microcrack results in a local decrease in hydrostatic stress. Hydro-
gen can no longer be held in the lattice at the same concentration, and therefore enters
the microcrack as gas, building up to an equilibrium pressure, Pe. The stress intensity
factor for the microcrack can be obtained from the well-known solution in section 2.8,
i.e.

     KI = 2S V Sa = 2S (CVys + Pe) Sa .                   (13.37)

   Equation (13.37) shows that an increase in Pe will increase KI. At the same time, by
analogy with external hydrogen embrittlement, an increase in Pe should decrease KIth for
the microcrack. Thus critical combinations of KI and Pe will result in exceedance of KIth
for the microcrack, which then will propagate back to the main crack or notch.

   When the microcrack links up with the main crack or notch the gas pressure drops to
zero. Thus crack growth stops until another microcrack is nucleated ahead of the new
crack front. This means that the total crack propagation process must take place in dis-
crete steps, and this is exactly what happens.
(4) The last topic to be discussed is the analysis and modelling of sustained load crack
growth rates. As in the case of fatigue crack growth, of the many models proposed for
sustained load crack growth only a few are quantitative in fracture mechanics terms.
13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 351

The difficulties of analysis are formidable, and the phenomenological behaviour is often
complex. Models predicting a dependence of da/dt on KI include:
· stress-assisted dissolution of the crack tip material (region I crack growth);
· stress-assisted diffusion of hydrogen (absorption + decohesion) for regions I and II

   crack growth in steels owing to stress corrosion and external and internal hydrogen
   embrittlement;
· the capillary model of stress corrosion.

   The stress-assisted dissolution model predicts a linear dependence of log(da/dt) on

where A is a constant, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, U is the crack tip radius,
E* is the activation energy of dissolution at zero load, and V* is an `activation volume'
whose precise physical meaning is unknown. A more serious objection to the model is
that it requires extremely high stresses | E/20 to exist in the crack tip region, reference
38. This means that the model cannot be applied to metallic materials, but it may be ap-
propriate to ceramics.

   A fairly successful model for sustained load crack growth due to stress-assisted dif-
fusion of hydrogen has been derived by van Leeuwen (reference 39) for stress corrosion
of high strength steels. Van Leeuwen proposed that the concentration of hydrogen
reaches a maximum at the elastic-plastic boundary directly ahead of the crack. When the
maximum hydrogen concentration reaches a critical value, Hcr, decohesion occurs at the
elastic-plastic boundary to cause cracking that links up with the main crack, as shown
schematically in figure 13.31. Overall crack propagation is treated as a series of such
steps, as in the case of internal hydrogen embrittlement.

   Note that it is an assumption of the model that the crack tip is sufficiently blunt for
the hydrostatic stress to be a maximum at the elastic-plastic boundary directly ahead of
the crack. This is a significant difference from what were found to be the requirements
for predicting KIth in gaseous hydrogen, i.e. sharp crack tips and lattice decohesion
commencing well within the plastic zone. However, there is ample evidence that a stress
corrosion crack can be blunted not only by plasticity but also by corrosion.

   To account for crack tip blunting van Leeuwen used the mode I elastic stress field
equations derived by Creager and Paris, i.e. equations (13.1) discussed at the beginning
of this chapter. The following general expression for the stress intensity factor KI was
obtained, assuming T = 0 in equation (13.1):

KI = Vy 2Sr ¨§ 2r ·  ¸.                          (13.39)

Substituting CVys for Vy and r = ry + U/2 gives

where ry is the distance along the x axis to the elastic plastic boundary and is also the
increment of crack growth. A problem is that equation (13.40) will have to be solved by
iteration. The actual value of ry is not known since it will depend on the plastic con-
13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 353

straint factor C (compare section 3.5). But C is not known and can only be estimated by
substituting r = ry + U/2 in equations (13.1) and calculating the principal stresses V1 and
V2 for T = 0°. Substituting these stresses and V3 = Q(V1 + V2) in the Von Mises yield
criterion results in

                2(ry + U)       (13.41)
C = 3U2 + (2ry + U)2(1  2Q)2 .

Thus C in its turn depends on what value of ry is substituted.
   Van Leeuwen determined a very complicated expression for the relation between

da/dt and the hydrogen concentration. Since the critical hydrogen concentration, Hcr,
depends on ry and U, da/dt will depend on ry and U as well. Choosing various values of
ry and U, solving equations (13.40) and (13.41) iteratively, and calculating da/dt from
the values of ry and U resulted in a series of curves relating da/dt and KI. An example is
given in figure 13.32. Good fits to experimental data are possible, especially for region

II crack growth.

   Note that the choice of U is always somewhat arbitrary. However, the value of ry
which is used in calculating KI also determines da/dt, i.e. ry is not a second arbitrary pa-
rameter for data fitting.

    Van Leeuwen also showed that the da/dtKI curve can be estimated remarkably well using equations

   Since the foregoing discussion was written, in the 1980s, there have been consider-
able advances in the understanding of hydrogen embrittlement, though not necessarily
in the context of fracture mechanics. The interested reader is referred to a special issue
of the well-known journal Engineering Fracture Mechanics (reference 40).

   The capillary model of stress corrosion (reference 41) proposes that under certain
conditions a crack may be incompletely penetrated by liquid, so that if crack propaga-
tion occurs the liquid must flow down the crack to maintain the propagation. If this dy-

namic capillary fluid flow is rate controlling the model predicts the existence of regions
I and III crack growth. The model also predicts dependencies of the crack growth rate
curve on fluid viscosity and external gas pressure. Limited testing of the model has been
done. The most that can be said is that capillary flow is likely to be a factor in stress cor-
rosion cracking, hut it is not known whether it can be rate controlling. It is worth noting,
however, that capillary flow could be rate controlling for crack growth due to liquid
metal embrittlement, since the velocities of cracking are often extremely high, |110
cm/s.

Superposition or Competition of Sustained Load Fracture and Fatigue

As mentioned in section 9.4, fatigue crack growth in aggressive environments can be
enhanced by sustained load fracture during each load cycle. There are two fairly simple
models which try to account for this effect:
· the superposition model, reference 42;
· the process competition model, reference 43.

The superposition model proposes that the overall crack growth rate is the sum of a
baseline fatigue component and a component due to sustained load fracture. On the
other hand, the process competition model assumes that fatigue and sustained load
fracture are mutually competitive and that the crack will grow at the fastest available
rate, whether that is the baseline fatigue crack growth rate or the crack growth per cycle
owing to sustained load fracture.

   The models can be expressed formally in the following way:

superposition model  ³ ©¨dn¹ §da¸· = ©¨dn¹ §da¸· + dtda·KI(t) dt ,   (13.43)

                     tot  B

                                 §da· §da·      ³ for ©¨dn¹ §da¸· >  da
process competition model ¨ ¸ = ¨ ¸                         B        dt·KI(t) dt

                                 ©dn¹tot ©dn¹B                                    (13.44)

                          ³ ³ = dtda·KI(t) dt for ©¨dn¹ §da¸· > dtda·KI(t) dt ,
                                                                 B

where the integral in equations (13.43) and (13.44) is taken over one cycle of the fatigue
loading and incorporates the effects of frequency, f, and stress ratio, R, via KI(t).

   Figure 13.33 is a schematic of the way in which the superposition model can be used
to predict the overall crack growth rate curve for constant amplitude sinusoidal loading.
For each 'K value of interest the integral in equation (13.43) can be obtained as the area
A under the curve relating da/dt and the load cycle wave form and frequency character-
istics (= 2Sft for sinusoidal loading). Addition of each A value to the baseline fatigue
crack growth rate at the same 'K results in the predicted overall crack growth rate
curve.

Figure 13.34. Comparison of model predictions with test data for 835M30 steel undergoing
                  stress corrosion during fatigue in salt water at R = 0.5.

   A similar procedure can be used for the process competition model, except that the
predicted overall crack growth rate curve is given either by the baseline fatigue crack
growth rate or by the integral in equations (13.44).

   A comparison of the predictions of both models with experimental data is given in
figure 13.34. The process competition model gives slightly better predictions, but both
models significantly overestimate the overall crack growth rates at each frequency. This
        13. The Influence of Material Behaviour on Fracture Mechanics Properties 357

is a general trend when the environment is liquid rather than gaseous, i.e. when stress
corrosion cracking occurs during each load cycle. The reason is that cyclic closing and
opening of the crack provide a pumping action that mixes the liquid near the crack tip,
and when the crack is open it takes a finite time for the liquid to re-establish the condi-
tions necessary for stress corrosion.

   There is no general trend of overestimation or underestimation when the models are
used to predict overall crack growth rates in gaseous environments, and agreement with
test data can be good or poor. Thus, in summary it seems fair to state that both models
give an indication of the effect of cycle frequency on the overall crack growth rates, but
neither is sufficiently accurate for determining whether superposition or competition of
sustained load fracture and fatigue actually occur.

Fracture Mechanics

An Engineering Primer

M. Janssen, J. Zuidema, R.J.H. Wanhill

In this second edition, which is the result of numerous revisions, updates
and additions, the authors cover the basic concepts of fracture mechanics
for both the linear elastic and elastic-plastic regimes. The fracture mechanics
parameters K, G, J and CTOD are treated in a basic manner along with
the test methods to determine critical values. The development of failure
assessment based on elastic-plastic fracture mechanics is reflected in a
comprehensive treatment.

Three chapters are devoted to the fracture mechanics characterisation of
crack growth. Fatigue crack growth is extensively treated and attention is
paid to the important topic of the initiation and growth of short fatigue cracks.
Furthermore, sustained load fracture and dynamic crack growth are discussed,
including various test techniques, e.g. the determination of the crack arrest
toughness.

Finally, there are two chapters dealing with mechanisms of fracture and the
ways in which actual material behaviour influences the fracture mechanics
characterisation of crack growth. This textbook is intended primarily for
engineering students. It will be useful to practising engineers as well, since it
provides the background to several test and design methods and to criteria for
material selection.
