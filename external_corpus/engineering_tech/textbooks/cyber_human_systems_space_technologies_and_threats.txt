DEDICATIONS

FROM PROFESSOR RANDALL K. NICHOLS:

I dedicate this book to All USA serving and retired military personnel, and federal, state and local law
enforcement for keeping our blessed Country safe; to my Angel wife of 39 years, Montine, and children Robin,
Kent, Phillip (USA Army), Diana (USA Army), and Michelle who have lived with a Dragon and survived; to
our newest family members Kira Nichols; grandson Greyson Kent Nichols; and finally, to all my students (over
52 years ~11,500 Dragons / Dragonesses in the field) who are securing our United States from terrorism and
evil.

   It is my sincere wish that our Cyber and Space technology writings may be used not only to defend our
Country but to envision humanitarian ways to more efficiently feed our expanding global population. Just
dream - if we could increase agricultural production by 1-1.5 %. Think how many millions of families we could
improve living conditions for!

   In addition, in 2017, 17 sailors died because of two separate collisions involving US Navy warships in the
South China Seas, the USS Fitzgerald, and the USS John S. McCain. In my professional opinion, the US
Navy's official response was insufficient regarding real causes. Since 2017, I have dedicated my research to
giving purpose, closure, truth, and voice to the families of these Honorable sailors. God grant them and their
loved ones peace.

   I dedicate my writing to the Ukrainian people suffering and fighting with such bravery against overwhelming
Russian savagery in a war they did not choose.

   Lastly, my deepest gratitude to my wonderful, talented KSU Wildcat writing team. It has been a real Honor.
My chapter on this earth is closing, and I have been truly blessed to work with you all. My cup runneth over. I
cannot thank you all enough for your dedication.

FROM DR. SUZANNE M. SINCAVAGE:

I want to dedicate my research to the men and women who are devoted to biodefense intelligence and the
non-proliferation of WMDs, To Professor Randall K. Nichols for his leadership, mentorship, integrity, and
significant contributions to uncharted spaces and for bringing together once again the WILDCAT team in
our pursuit of excellence; To Julie J.C.H. Ryan for devoting an incredible amount of time to supporting me
in my work; To Trevor Muehlfelder, my esteemed co-author for whose unwavering commitment, expertise
and collaboration have been invaluable in the creation of this book and its cover. To my sons Trevor, Cole
Muehlfelder an (Aspiring ERAU Professor), and Jacquie for bringing Callum into this world, and David
a (Master Machinist) for their loving encouragement, To Dr. Steve Herrick, and the entire Herrick family
10 | DEDICATIONS

for their belief and support in me, To Candice Carter, a loyal colleague and friend, & Co-Chair for "The
Foundation for Biodefense Research", her devotion and support are invaluable, and to Mila Bonner, a life-time
friend who is an expert in Life-work balance.

FROM DR. HANS C. MUMM:

I dedicate this work to my students and colleagues and all those innovators, those dreamers who race against
time as they create an ever-changing and evolving future in ways that we cannot even imagine today. Your
dedication to the field of autonomous systems will bring about positive change to the world landscape and
humankind.

FROM WAYNE D. LONSTEIN, ESQ.:

I dedicate this work to my wife and best friend Julie, my sons Ethan, Ari, and Sam, extended family and co-
workers, and co-authors from whom I have learned so much. To all those brave souls who have made the
ultimate sacrifice serving this nation and those who have, are, or will serve in our armed forces, police, fire,
and other emergency functions and their families who silently sacrifice. May our work in some way help you
perform your duties more effectively and safely, and through your service, may the world become a more
peaceful and harmonious place for all.

FROM DR. JULIE J. C. H. RYAN:

I dedicate this work to my husband, Dan, and my students, who have taught me so much.

FROM PROFESSOR CANDICE M. CARTER:

I dedicate this work to an exceptional leader, mentor, and master of Bushido, Professor Randall K. Nichols. His
commitment to training dragons to succeed in asymmetric warfare and life is unprecedented. For Dr. Suzanne
Sincavage, co-author, a guiding mentor for biodefense research and life. To Treadstone71 for being a guiding
light through the dark parts of the web. Finally, to the Los Libros, I love you immensely my shining stars.

FROM CPT JOHN-PAUL HOOD:

I dedicate this work to my loving and supportive wife, Katie, my two daughters, Evelyn and Gwendolyn,
and my extended family. They continued to support me through this journey. Thank you for your love,
encouragement, and presence in my life.

FROM DR. MARK J. JACKSON:

I dedicate my chapter to my wife, Deborah, and the memory of my great-uncle, Captain George Richards,
                                                                                                                                             DEDICATIONS | 11

a founding officer of the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers of the British Army. After
initially serving in the British Expeditionary Force (Royal Engineers) in France from 1940 - to 1941, he quickly
rose through the ranks, promoted to captain in 1942, initially serving as an officer in the Royal Engineers,
then transferred to the newly formed Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers specializing in the
construction of Bailey bridges in North Africa. Captured in Libya by the German Afrika Corps, he became
a prisoner-of-war at Oflag IV located in Colditz, Germany. After demobilization, he became a chartered
mechanical engineer working for Imperial Chemical Industries but continued to build model Bailey bridges
with his children and nephews.

FROM DR. ROBERT MCCREIGHT:

I dedicate my chapter to all US service personnel who fought in, or supported, combat operations with
unflagging thanks to their families for the sacrifice that cannot be measured. Honorable military service must
be acknowledged and respected as a tireless effort to keep our nation safe and secure tomorrow's peace as a
sacred duty. The American warfighters are the heart and soul of the fight against evil oppressors.

   There are sincere thanks to serious professional and dedicated members of law enforcement whose daily
routine involves our first line of domestic security and societal stability. These unselfish warriors and police
never get the full thanks and gratitude they genuinely deserve. Thanks, and a salute from a grateful nation.

FROM WILLIAM SLOFER:

As usual, I would like to thank God for the opportunities and pathways he has made available and the
inspiration that led to the crafting of this work. A thank you to all the service men and women past and present
for their commitment and service. To Dr. Korn, Dr. H. Bell, and Charles Marrow for their inspiration resulting
in the physics and math principles used in this content. Also, a special thanks to Charlene Jones for her support
and technical editing and my daughter Jessica for her continued support, encouragement, and partnership in
lifelong learning which helped with this research.

FROM LTC JERRY V. DREW USARMY CAC (USA):

I would like to dedicate this work to my son Jerry. He will be 39- the age I am now - in 2048. The future will
be different than we can know, but we are trying to make it a good one.

FROM TREVOR MUEHLFELDER:

This work is dedicated to the support and opportunity provided by Dr. Suzanne Sincavage, Professor Randall
K. Nichols, and the many friends and family that encourage me to go farther. It is dedicated to the pursuit of
knowledge and the tireless efforts of scholars, researchers, and authors who have contributed to the vast wealth
of information found in print encyclopedias, non-fiction books, academic journals, and dictionaries.
12 | DEDICATIONS

FROM JOHN TOEBES:

I dedicate my chapter to my wife, Mary Ellen, who tirelessly works with me to coach the FIRST Tech Challenge
robotics teams that our daughter, Margaret, had the amazing foresight to start. To our other daughter, Ann
Marie, I am grateful for keeping me apprised of the latest in medical technology. To all of the students who
have come through the FIRST program, we challenge you to use what you have learned to make the world a
better place.

FROM DR. SINY JOSEPH:

I would like to dedicate this book chapter to my parents Colonel A. V. Joseph (retired) and Lisa Joseph,
without their sacrifices and dedication, I would never be what I am, my best friend and brother George Aikara,
who inspires and amazes me every single day, my mentors on whose giant shoulders I stand, my students
who motivate me to give my best, my biggest cheerleading twin daughters Sanya and Tanya Namboodiri
who breathe life into me and make it all meaningful, and lastly, my husband Dr. Vinod Namboodiri, who
challenges, pushes and enables me to do and be better, and takes greater pride in my achievements than his
own!

FROM: DR. SAEED KHAN:

I would like to dedicate this humble work to my big sister, Dina Sultana, who recently passed away leaving an
emptiness in our hearts. She was great at mathematics, winning performance awards at school and also found
time to be good at painting. She will be missed by all those who knew and loved her.

FROM MAX FARCOT:

I dedicate my chapter to my fellow Dragon teammates from previous KSU academic projects: Justin Redetzke,
Jeff Harris, and Professor Randall K. Nichols. I would also like to give special thanks to the rest of the members
of our KSU author's team.

FROM MAJOR CARTER DIEBOLD:

My chapter is dedicated to the Soldiers of Echo Company, who have continuously motivated and inspired me
through their relentless commitment to America's Joint Forces operating far from home. Additionally, this
chapter could not have been possible without the love and support of Megan, who stood by me through years
of late nights and time away from home. Finally, I would like to thank Professor Randy Nichols, my instructor
for the last year and leader of this project. Without his personal motivation, leadership, and guidance, I would
never have attempted to tackle such a complex topic, much less attempt to write about it. I am forever grateful
for the opportunity to be a part of this team.

FROM PETER D. JOHNSON:

I would like to dedicate my chapter to the Soldiers, Civilians, and Law Enforcement Professionals who are
diligently serving and protecting our shores, stepping into the arena to keep us safe at night. To Carter D,
for support and guidance on Prof Nichols' wild ride. To Prof Nichols for providing the confidence, the
challenge, and the push outside my comfort zone. And most importantly to my wife Laura and children
Jillian, Christopher, and Avery for providing me the confidence and support in my professional and personal
endeavors, often sacrificing more than anyone will ever know.

FOREWORD [COL. JOEL D. ANDERSON
(RET) - KSU OVPR (RET)]

When I was asked to do this forward, I was in the process of retiring from academia after 10 years in the
scientific, technical and research arena of higher education. At first, I was hesitant to accept this honor but
reminded myself that I had amassed nearly 5 decades of experience relevant to the topics covered in this text.
I reminded myself that I had been designated a subject matter expert (SME) by the Homeland Defense &
Security Information Analysis Center (HDIAC) while at Kansas State University. I considered that before
arriving at Kansas State University I had spent three years in industry supporting technical innovation efforts
as both a technical director for a major international corporation, and as the inaugural director for a small
company leading its autonomous systems group (ASG). I reminded myself that I had enjoyed a 26 ½ year career
as an intelligence professional, imagery officer, space operations officer, a DAWIA level III certified program
manager, and as a strategic intelligence planner.

   I decided that my past experiences provided me with potentially unique insights into strategic, operational,
tactical, and technical intelligence and research related to the topics discussed herein. In reviewing the sections
I did so not only looking at the value of its content for the student, but in assessing broader critical insights that
the text might provide to others in government, industry and academia having served in each sector.

   Cyber-Human Systems, Space Technologies and Threats is the 8th in a series of seminal texts focused
on influencing student and workforce development, critical thinking, and discovery. I found the topics in this
text to accurately reflect the complexity and realities of the emerging human machine world we live in here
on earth and in newfound discoveries that await us in space. A world where human/machine interactions are
blending and merging in ways that were unimaginable just a few short years ago. This text focuses on important
considerations for highly technical and demanding disciplines associated with cyber-human systems, space
technologies and real and emerging threats. Each section and chapter covers a myriad of deeply insightful
topics and considerations from expert practitioners in their respective fields. It provides a logical and practical
framework for learning not only for the student, but for those already in the workforce looking for continuing
education, certification, and credentials necessary to support national security at the critical emerging
technology level. The authors have effectively captured topics of critical importance to our sustaining
technological competitiveness, national security, economic growth, and workforce development.

   In 1962, during his "We Choose the Moon" speech, President John F. Kennedy stated that "The growth of
our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment, by new techniques
of learning and mapping and observation, by new tools and computers for industry, medicine, the home as well as
the school." He proceeded to articulate this simply by stating "We choose to go to the moon....and do the other
                                                                        FOREWORD [COL. JOEL D. ANDERSON (RET) - KSU OVPR (RET)] | 17

things, not because they are easy but because they are hard...." This text embodies this message in its fullest.
We have come a long way since 1962. We still have a long way to go.

   In laying out this text, the authors have chosen to tackle hard subjects that we must consider for our next
generation of leaders and practitioners. They have done so in a manner that not only captures a current
understanding of the technological and threat playing field, but have artfully set their sights outward to the
future by logically laying out things to consider and, where needed, challenging conventional norms. As I
reviewed the content, not only was I pleased with the technical expertise of the authors, but found that each
chapter left me wanting more. It reminded me of a phrase that Neil deGrasse Tyson is attributed as saying:
"There are times, at least for now, when we must be content to love the questions themselves."

   I am confident that you will find the subject matter relevant, deeply enriching, and as either student or
practitioner-leaving you with a thirst for wanting more. I am confident that those using this text will find
answers in the material provided and energized by its content. I am also confident that in using this text, you
will also find yourself asking many questions as you work through this now and hopefully many more in the
future.

   I applaud the authors for assembling its content and commend Cyber-Human Systems, Space
Technologies and Threats for wide distribution and use. They have not only provided the facts and answers,
but they will have also stimulated the questions of a new generation.

   I am hopeful that in using this text you not only learn from it, but do so knowing that at one point in time
we chose the moon.

   Enjoy, learn, challenge and be challenged.

PREFACE (NICHOLS)

CYBER-HUMAN SYSTEMS, SPACE TECHNOLOGIES AND THREATSis our eighth textbook in a
series covering the world of UASs / CUAS/ UUVs / SPACE. Other textbooks in our series are Space Systems:
Emerging Technologies and Operations; Drone Delivery of CBNRECy - DEW Weapons: Emerging
Threats of Mini-Weapons of Mass Destruction and Disruption (WMDD); Disruptive Technologies
with applications in Airline, Marine, Defense Industries; Unmanned Vehicle Systems & Operations
On Air, Sea, Land; Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technologies and Operations; Unmanned
Aircraft Systems in the Cyber Domain: Protecting USA's Advanced Air Assets, 2nd edition; and
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the Cyber Domain Protecting USA's Advanced Air Assets,
1st edition. Our previous seven titles have received considerable global recognition in the field. (Nichols
& Carter, CYBER-HUMAN SYSTEMS, SPACE TECHNOLOGIES AND THREATS, 2023) (Nichols R.
K., 2022) (Nichols & Carter, Drone Delivery of CBNRECy - DEW Weapons: Emerging Threats of Mini-
Weapons of Mass Destruction and Disruption (WMDD), 2022) (Nichols, et al., 2021) (Nichols R. K., et al.,
2020) (Nichols R. , et al., 2020) (Nichols R. , et al., 2019) (Nichols R. K., 2018) [1]

   Our eighth title takes on a new purview of Cyber-Human Systems (CHS) and their effects on our world.
The textbook is broken down into three sections: Cyber-Human Systems; Space Technologies, Space Threats
(CHS used in Space vehicles and exploration and Space warfare, hypersonics and materials needed for off world
travel.)

   Section 1 looks at our technological future and how humans are merging with machines. The misuse of
technology is addressed in a chapter on CHS sensors and the law. Another chapter looks at the artificial brain
and body - specifically the levels of autonomy that can practically be achieved. Chapter 4 addresses a serious
concern - feeding a globally growing population. How? By applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
language programming (ML) to food production / distribution / and protection cycle. The next chapter zeros
in on Cyborgs, singularity, and their use in space. We drop back in the next chapter to touch on history with
the Turing legacy. Another chapter covers the reality of managing mixed machine - human teams. The section
ends with a serious look at Neurostrike and CHATGPT.

   Section 2 is devoted to space and threats. One chapter terrifies the reader with biological threats and
distribution from space vehicles. Another presents the elements of space electronic warfare with interest
in jamming and spoofing GPS signals. Still another looks at Space systems modeling and simulation. Five
major tools are presented. The author takes on the problem of conducting Deep Space Warfare and Space
Dominance. This is a fascinating and complex logistics theater of warfare.

   Section 3 continues the theme of space warfare and adds hypersonics and materials of construction for space
vehicles. Our resident expert on hypersonic missiles and space defense gives the reader another bite on the apple
                                                                                                                                    PREFACE (NICHOLS) | 19

from Book 7. We continue our review of cyber threats in space and speculate on the future of cyberwarfare.
Space missions have an economic framework, and this is covered in chapter 15. Quantum technologies are
making a big splash. We address their applicability to space operations. Our final chapter is a brilliant look at
inventions for transferring wireless power for space applications.

   State-of-the-Art research by a team of eighteen SMEs is incorporated into our book. We trust you will enjoy
reading it as much as we have in its writing. There is hope for the future.

- 1) danger close is included in the "method-of-engagement" line of a call-for-fire request to indicate that
friendly forces are close to the target. ... Danger close is a term that is exclusive from risk estimate distance
(RED) although the RED for 0.1 percent PI is used to define danger close for aircraft delivery. Pi = Probability
of incapacitation. 2) Definition of "danger close" (US DoD) In close air support, artillery, mortar, and naval
gunfire support fires, it is the term included in the method of engagement segment of a call for fires which
indicates that friendly forces are within close proximity of the target.

EW    Electronic warfare[Legacy EW definitions: EW was classically divided into (Adamy D., EW 101

A First Course in Electronic Warfare, 2001):

· ESM - Electromagnetic Support Measures - the receiving part of EW.
· ECM - Electromagnetic Countermeasures - jamming, chaff, flares used to interfere with operations of

   radars, military communications, and heat-seeking weapons.
· ECCM -Electronic Counter-Counter Measures - measures are taken to design or operate radars or

   communications systems to counter the effects of ECM.[1]
62 | ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS

Not included in the EW definitions were Anti-radiation Weapons (ARW) and Directed Energy Weapons
(DEW).

   USA and NATO have updated these categories:

· ES - Electronic warfare Support (old ESM) to monitor the R.F. environment.
· EA - Electronic Attack - the old ECM includes ASW and D.E. weapons; to deny, disrupt, deceive,

   exploit, and destroy adversary electronic systems.
· EP - Electronic Protection measures - (old ECCM) (Adamy D., EW 101 A First Course in Electronic

   Warfare, 2001) to guard friendly systems from hostile attacks.[2]

EW Electronic Warfare (EW) is the art and science of denying an enemy the benefits of the
electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) while preserving them for friendly forces. (Wolff, 2022)ES is different from
Signal Intelligence (SIGINT). SIGINT comprises Communications Intelligence (COMINT) and Electronic
Intelligence (ELINT). All these fields involve the receiving of enemy transmissions. (Adamy D., EW 101 A

the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term "laser" originated as an acronym for "light
amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." A laser differs from other light sources in that it emits light
coherently, spatially, and temporally. Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused on a tight spot, enabling
laser cutting and lithography applications laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser
beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can
also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can
emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond. Used:
for military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed." (Wiki-L, 2018)

is an attack to provide false information to GPS receivers by broadcasting counterfeit signals similar

to the original GPS signal or by recording the original GPS signal captured somewhere else at some

other time and then retransmitting the signal. The Spoofing Attack causes GPS receivers to provide

the wrong information about position

    and time. (T.E. Humphrees, 2008) (Tippenhauer & et.al, 2011) (Eichelberger, Robust Global

SPECIAL DEFINITIONS (NICHOLS & CARTER, 2022) (NICHOLS R. K., 2020)

Asymmetric warfare can describe a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and,
in the struggle, interact and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often
involve strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the weaker combatants attempting to use strategy to
offset deficiencies in quantity or quality of their forces and equipment. (Thomas, 2010) Such strategies may
not necessarily be militarized. (Steponova, 2016)

   This contrasts with symmetric warfare, where two powers have comparable military power and resources
and rely on similar tactics, differing only in details and execution. (Thomas, 2010)

CLASSIFICATION OF SATELLITES

Satellites are classified in terms of their purpose and are classified as follows:
   Astronomical satellites - observation of distant planets and galaxies.
   Biosatellites - carry living organisms to aid scientific experiments.
   Communication satellites - communications satellites use geosynchronous or Low Earth orbits to

communicate with each other and other systems.
   Earth observation satellites (EOS) are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environmental

monitoring, meteorology, and producing maps.
   Killer satellites are designed to destroy warheads, satellites, and space-based objects.
   Navigational satellites use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to

determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the
ground allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in
real-time.

   Reconnaissance satellites are communications satellites deployed for military or intelligence applications.
80 | ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS

   Recovery satellites provide a recovery of reconnaissance, biological, space-production, and other payloads
from orbit to Earth.

   Space stations are orbital structures designed for human beings to live in space. A space station is
distinguished from other crewed spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities. Space stations
are designed for medium-term living in orbit.

   Tether satellites are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether; and
   Weather satellites are used to monitor Earth's weather and climate.
   Drake Equation. An equation proposed by Cornell astronomer Frank Drake in 1961, what attempts to
calculate the number of sentient species which could exist and are potential contacts during the life of our
civilization.

   Electronic Warfare (EW) is the art and science of denying an enemy the benefits of the electromagnetic
spectrum (EMS) while preserving them for friendly forces. (Wolff, 2022)

   Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) is the analysis and identifying intercepted transmissions, including
frequency, bandwidth, modulation ("waveform"), and polarization. Four categories of SIGINT are: (Wolff,
2022)

  · Electronic Intelligence (ELINT)
  · Communications Intelligence (COMINT)
  · Foreign instrument SIGINT (FISINT)

  · Measurement intelligence (MASINT) Covered in Chapter 10 of DRONE DELIVERY OF CBNRECy
      - DEW WEAPONS Emerging Threats of Mini-Weapons of Mass Destruction and Disruption
      (WMDD) (Nichols & Sincavage, 2022)

EW SUB-AREAS

Electronic Warfare Support (EWS/ES) measures detection, intercept, identification, location, and localizes
sources of intended and unintended radiated electromagnetic (EM) energy. (Wolff, 2022)

   Activities related to ES include:

  · Electronic Reconnaissance: location, identification, and evaluation of foreign electromagnetic radiation
  · Electronic intelligence: Technical and geolocation intelligence derived from foreign non-communications

      electromagnetic radiation emanating from sources other than nuclear detonations or radioactive sources
  · Electronics security: protection resulting from all measures designed to deny unauthorized persons
                                                                                                                ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS | 81

      information of value that might be derived from the interception and study of non-communications
      electromagnetic radiation, e.g., radar. (Wolff, 2022)[3]

Electronic Attack (EA) activities - may be either offensive or defensive and include: (Wolff, 2022)

  · Countermeasures: employment of devices and/or techniques that has as their objective the impairment
      of the operational effectiveness of enemy activity

  · Electromagnetic deception: Covered in Chapter 7 of DRONE DELIVERY OF CBNRECy - DEW
      WEAPONS

  · Emerging Threats of Mini-Weapons of Mass Destruction and Disruption (WMDD) (Nichols &
      Sincavage, 2022) Various EM deception techniques, such as a false target or duplicate target generation,
      confuse the enemy intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems (ISR). (Wolff, 2022)

  · Electromagnetic intrusion: is the intentional insertion of EM energy (EME) into transmission paths in
      any manner to deceive operators or to cause confusion.

  · Electromagnetic jamming is deliberate radiation, reradiation, or reflection of EME to prevent or reduce
      an enemy's effective use of the EMS and with the intent of degrading or neutralizing the enemy's
      combat capability.

  · Electromagnetic pulse is EM radiation from a strong electronic pulse [Directed energy weapons (DEW)]
      that may couple with electrical or electrical systems to produce damaging current and voltages. (Wolff,
      2022)Chapters 9-11 in DRONE DELIVERY OF CBNRECy - DEW WEAPONS Emerging Threats of
      Mini-Weapons of Mass Destruction and Disruption (WMDD) expertly cover the subject. (Nichols &
      Sincavage, 2022)

  · Electronic probing is intentional radiation designed to be introduced into the devices and systems of
      potential enemies to learn the operational capabilities of the devices and systems.

  · Cyber or electronic spoofing: - A Cyber-weapon attack that generates false signals to replace valid ones.
      GPS Spoofing is an attack to provide false information to GPS receivers by broadcasting counterfeit
      signals similar to the original GPS signal or by recording the original GPS signal captured somewhere
      else at some other time and then retransmitting the signal. The Spoofing attack causes GPS receivers to
      provide the wrong information about position and time. (T.E. Humphrees, 2008) (Tippenhauer & et.al,

ELECTRONIC PROTECTION MEASURES (EP): EP MEASURES FALL INTO SIX
82 | ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS

CATEGORIES: (WOLFF, 2022)

EM hardening: actions are taken to protect personnel, facilities, and or equipment by blanking, filtering,
attenuating, grounding, bonding, and shielding against undesirable effects of EME.

   Electronic masking: controlled radiation of EME on friendly frequencies to protect the emissions of friendly
communications and electronic systems against enemy EWS measures and SIGINT without significantly
degrading the operation of friendly systems.

   Emission control: sensitive and controlled use of EM, acoustic, or other emitters to optimize command
and control (C2) capabilities while minimizing the following for operations security (OPSEC): 1) detection
by enemy sensors; 2) mutual interference among friendly systems; 3) enemy interference with the ability to
execute a military deception plan. (Wolff, 2022)

   EMS management: planning, coordinating, and managing joint use of the EMS through operational,
engineering, and administrative procedures.

   Wartime reserve modes: characteristics and operating procedures for sensors, communications, navigation
aids, threat recognition, weapons, and countermeasures systems that will contribute to military effectiveness
if unknown to or misunderstood by opposing commanders before they are used but could be exploited or
neutralized if known in advance. (Wolff, 2022)

   EM compatibility: the ability of systems, equipment, and devices that use the EMS to operate in their
intended environments without causing or suffering unacceptable or unintentional degradation because of
electromagnetic radiation (EMR) or response. (Wolff, 2022) This is an extremely important concept and is
exploited by the use of UAS against USN assets in the South China Seas (SCS.) (Nichols & al., Unmanned
Vehicle Systems and Operations on Air, Sea, and Land, 2020)

   False Flag Operation - organized spreading of misinformation or disinformation.

EICHELBERGER COLLECTIVE DETECTION (ECD) DEFINITIONS / COUNTER SPOOFING
CONCEPTS

Acquisition - Acquisition is the process in a GPS receiver that finds the visible satellite signals and detects the

delays of the PRN sequences and the Doppler shifts of the signals.

Circular Cross-Correlation (CCC) - In a GPS classical receiver, the circular cross-correlation is a similarity

measure between two vectors of length N, circularly shifted by a given displacement d:

N-1

Cxcorr (a, b , d) =  ai dot bI + d mod N  Eq. 3-1

I=0

The two vectors are most similar at the displacement d, where the sum (CCC value) is maximum. The vector

of CCC values with all N displacements can be efficiently computed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) in  (

N log N ) time. [4](Eichelberger, Robust Global Localization using GPS and Aircraft Signals, 2019)

Like classical GPS receivers, coarse-Time Navigation (CTN) is a snapshot receiver localization technique
                                                                                                               ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS | 83

that measures sub-millisecond satellite ranges from correlation peaks. (IS-GPS-200G, 2013) [See also expanded
definition above.]

   Collective Detection (CD) is a maximum likelihood snapshot receiver localization method, which does not
determine the arrival time for each satellite but combines all the available information and decides only at the
end of the computation. This technique is critical to the (Eichelberger, Robust Global Localization using GPS
and Aircraft Signals, 2019) invention to mitigate spoofing attacks on GPS or ADS-B.

   Coordinate System - A coordinate system uses an ordered list of coordinates to uniquely describe the
location of points in space. The meaning of the coordinates is defined concerning some anchor points. The
point with all coordinates being zero is called the origin. [ Examples: terrestrial, Earth-centered, Earth-fixed,
ellipsoid, equator, meridian longitude, latitude, geodetic latitude, geocentric latitude, and geoid. [5]

   Localization - Process of determining an object's place concerning some reference, usually coordinate
systems. [aka Positioning or Position Fix]

   Navigation Data is the data transmitted from satellites, which includes orbit parameters to determine the
satellite locations, timestamps of signal transmission, atmospheric delay estimations, and status information of
the satellites and GPS as a whole, such as the accuracy and validity of the data. (IS-GPS-200G, 2013) [6]

   Pseudo-Random Noise (PRN) sequences are pseudo-random bit strings. Each GPS satellite uses a unique
PRN sequence with a length of 1023 bits for its signal transmissions. aka as Gold codes, they have a low cross-
correlation with each other. (IS-GPS-200G, 2013)

   Snapshot GPS Receiver- A snapshot receiver is a global positioning satellite (GPS) receiver that captures one
or a few milliseconds of raw GPS signal for a location fix. (Diggelen, 2009)

   GO VS. CHESS - Space Dominance should be thought of as a game of GO,[7] NOT chess. In the
former, the opponent aims to encircle (strangle) the opponent and deny him his strategic maneuver capability;
in the latter, the opponent aims to completely deprive him of individual pieces (assets) or prevent defensive
movement so that he can slaughter his ruler (king). (Wright, 2020)

   ISR - Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance [8]
   Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations (ISR) are used to collect information about the
enemy, terrain, weather, and other aspects of the Area of Operation (AO) that will affect friendly combat
operations. (Global Security.Org, 2022)
   The Army has conducted reconnaissance and surveillance tasks since its inception. The production of
intelligence (the product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, analysis, evaluation, and
interpretation of available information concerning an enemy force or area of operation) has always been
critical to successfully accomplishing the mission. ISR is the term currently applied to combined arms enabling
operation that combines previously described as reconnaissance and surveillance (a maneuver or collection
task) with the production and dissemination of intelligence (a staff task). ISR is a constant, continuous, and
optimized operation that focuses on the collection of relevant information that is analyzed to create

ISR SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY FROM SPACE

MIT gives an interesting purview of their mission for ISR from space. They see it as "Creating Technology To
Provide Vital Tactical Information." They conduct "R&D in advanced sensing, signal and image processing,
decision support technology, and high-performance embedded computing to provide systems capable of
gathering reliable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information." (MIT R&D, 2022) It is this
purview that the authors see from the user POV to develop "earth traces" from space capable of yielding unique
information on non-military technologies such as agriculture management, crop rotation, global food supply,
tree and fire zone management, and cattle management.

SATELLITE ORBITS

The most common type of orbit is a geocentric orbit, with over 3,000 active artificial satellites orbiting the Earth.
Geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude, inclination, and eccentricity.

   The commonly used altitude classifications of the geocentric orbit are Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium
Earth Orbit (MEO), Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO), and High Earth Orbit (HEO). Low Earth Orbit is any
orbit below 2,000 km, Medium Earth Orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 36,000 km, and High Earth Orbit
is greater than 36,000 km. LLO: low lunar orbit is approximately 100 km above the lunar surface. L1 and
L2: "Lagrange points are caused by the balance between the gravitational fields of two large bodies; equilibria
between two pulling forces.

CENTRIC CLASSIFICATIONS

A galactocentric orbit is an orbit around the center of a galaxy.
   A heliocentric orbit is an orbit around the Sun. In our Solar System, all planets, comets, and asteroids are in

such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris.
   Geocentric orbit is an orbit around Earth, such as the Moon or artificial satellites. Currently, there are over

2,500 active artificial satellites orbiting the Earth.

ALTITUDE CLASSIFICATIONS

Low Earth Orbit (LEO): Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 180 km - to 2,000 km.
   Medium Earth Orbit (MEO): Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2,000 km - to 20,000 km.
   Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO): Geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of 36,000 km. The orbit period

equals one sidereal day, which coincides with the Earth's rotation period. The speed is 3,075 m/s (10,090 ft/s).
                                                                                                               ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS | 85

   High Earth orbit (HEO): Geocentric orbits above the altitude of a geosynchronous orbit (GEO) > 36,000
km (~ 40,000 km).

   Light-year - 5.879 x 1012 miles

AGROTERRORISM / BIOTERRORISM DEFINITIONS

Agroterrorism is a subset of bioterrorism and is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant
disease to generate fear, causing economic losses and/or undermining stability. (O.S. Cupp, 2004)

   Bioterrorism is the threat or use of biological agents by individuals or groups motivated by political,
religious, ecological, or other ideological objectives.

   Earth Observation Epidemiology or tele-epidemiology is defined as `using space technology with
remote sensing in epidemiology. (Wiki, 2022)

   MASINT - Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) is a technical branch of intelligence
gathering that detect, track, identify or describe the distinctive characteristics (signatures) of fixed or dynamic
target sources. This often includes radar, acoustic, nuclear, chemical, and biological intelligence. MASINT
is scientific and technical intelligence derived from the analysis of data obtained from sensing instruments
to identify any distinctive features associated with the source, emitter, or sender, to facilitate the latter's
measurement and identification. (Wiki, 2022)

   OSI, short for OPEN-SOURCE Intelligence (also known as OSINT), is defined as any intelligence
produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner
to an appropriate audience to address a specific intelligence requirement. (Bazzell, 2021)

   Remote Sensing (RS) uses non-ground-based imaging systems to obtain information about processes and
events on Earth. It is unique among the detection and diagnostic methods discussed herein in its ability to offer
passive monitoring for the disease at scale rather than active sampling. (Silva & et.al, 2021)

   Sentient - The ability of an organism to perceive and feel things. This definition implies that said organism
is capable of rational thought and decision-making.

   State - A state can mean a country, a government, or political authority. It means absolute control over a
fixed territory on Earth.

[6] Each satellite has a unique 1023-bit PRN sequence, plus some current navigation data, D. Each bit is
repeated 20 times for better robustness. Navigation data rate is limited to 50 bit / s. This also limits sending
timestamps every 6 seconds, satellite orbit parameters (function of the satellite location over time) only every
30 seconds. As a result, the latency of the first location estimates after turning on a classic receiver, called the
time to first fix (TTFF), can be high.

THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE - MERGING
WITH MACHINES [TOEBES]

OBJECTIVES

  · Students shall comprehend the different forms of integration of the human body with machines.
  · Students shall understand the differences between Replacement of body parts, Augmentation to go

      beyond human limits and Simulation to fool our senses as well as our Connection to the machines of
      the world.

INTRODUCTION

The world continues to evolve, and people have always sought to improve how to live and control their
interactions with that changing world. With integration between the human body and the many machines that
we create, we seek to improve both our longevity and how we experience and perceive everything around us.

   This level of integration can be broken into three approaches: Replacement, Augmentation and Simulation.
Each of these strategies affect our connection to the world.

   In the simplest form, Replacement is about substitution of an external creation for a failing or missing part.
From life sustaining parts such as artificial hearts to functional prosthetic limbs, the goal is to bring a body up
to an expected level of performance.

   Taking the next step with Augmentation is to make the replacement part perform a function better than
what was originally done such as a bionic eye or to add a new function to the body such as infrared vision or
magnetic sensing. It is worth noting that there is a fine line between Replacement and Augmentation based on
the intention.

   At the extreme, Simulation allows feeding external stimuli directly into the body fooling it into believing
that something artificial is actually happening. While images of movies like The Matrix may come to mind,
this last category is well entrenched in today's youth through online gaming which strives to provide a more
realistic and encompassing experience.

   All of these strategies for integrating with the machines of the world are predicated on the human mind still
being in control. Note that strategies with an Artificially Intelligent entity are addressed in the next chapter.

REPLACEMENT - MECHATRONICS
We have always had a need to replace the functionality of a lost body part to varying degrees. The most obvious
being the loss of a limb being replaced by a prosthetic equivalent. It should be no surprise that the oldest
known prosthetic is over 3,000 years old: the Greville Chester Great Toe [Figure 11] (Daley, 2017) (Choi,
2007) (Dvorsky, 2017) which was made from wood and leather that was made for a 50-60 year old woman.
What is significant about this early prosthetic is that it was designed to operate like the body part it replaced
unlike earlier ones which were just an imitation of the part but not functional and hence difficult to wear over
an extended period.

                                    Figure 11: Ancient Egyptian Prosthetic Toe

   Another early attempt at replacing a missing limb is the Capua Leg from 300 BC (Copy of Roman artificial
leg, London, England, 1905-1915) which was created in bronze. While this was one of the earliest known

leg prosthetics, the construction of it from bronze would have made it uncomfortable to wear. Although the
original was destroyed during an Air Raid in World War II, modern 3D printing techniques have allowed
researchers at the Peter Osypka Institute of Medical Engineering (Otte & Hazubski, 2019) to create a replica to
understand how it originally operated.

3D PRINTING REPLACEMENT PARTS
It is only in the past couple of decades that 3D printing has progressed to the level that it can be used to
create replacement prosthetics. In fact, 3D printing has made it possible for the average person to create a
viable substitute limb and digits. We have seen simple designs from six girls on a Girl Scouts based FIRST Lego
League team (Iowa Girl Scouts, 2011) who created a prosthetic hand device to enable a 3-year old girl (Figure
13) to write (Boyle, 2011). (United States of America Patent No. 8,840,157, 2014)

   Source: (United States of America Patent No. 8,840,157, 2014)
   Other robotics teams have created more complex designs working with the e-nable organization (Enabling
The Future). Based on the e-nablev designs, a FIRST Robotics team of 25 high school students 3D printed a
functioning prosthetic hand (Figure 14). (FIRST Robotics, 2021)

   Another group has taken the e-nable design to the next level creating an Iron Man themed functioning
prosthetic arm (Figure 15) (Grunewald, 2016). By creating a series of superhero themed prosthetic limbs, not
only have the recipient gained use of a missing limb, the themed prosthetics often cause them to become the
envy of their classmates.

   An advantage of many of these 3D printed prosthetics is that they are inexpensive to manufacture and
replace as well as simple to maintain because they rely on existing muscles to control them. However, other
advancements in technology have allowed for much more complex control of the replacement parts. It is
important to note that for much of the population, a high-quality prosthetic can be out of reach from a cost
perspective. It is for this reason that there continues to be innovation in low-end and open-source technologies.
Often work goes in both directions to produce high end prosthetics while at the same time using those
learnings in order to produce a more cost-effective version.

   It is also worth noting that people with replacement parts can perform at some of the highest levels
of athletics. Already in the Paralympics we have competitors with prosthetic limbs or wheelchair bound
coming close to or even beating Olympic times (Buchholz, 2021). In fact, the performance and perceived
advantage of blade running athletes has led to the Olympics committee banning such athletes from competing
against athletes without prosthetics, but a study published in the Royal Society Open Science shows that no
such advantage exists. (Beck, Taboga, & Grabowski, 2022) The fact that we are having to have this level of
discussion attests to the advancement of Replacement and shows how we are very quickly moving into the
realm of Augmentation.

BIOMECHATRONICS

As the technology for replacement of body parts goes beyond the simple mechanical replacement of a body part
with another physical replica, the integration of the replacement into the body requires additional technologies
applied. This is the realm of biomechatronics in which the biological and mechanical disciplines are combined.
                                                           THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE - MERGING WITH MACHINES [TOEBES] | 129

Sometimes the learnings from a full biomechatronic implementation can be used to benefit a fully mechanical
implementation.

   One such example is at MIT where work has been done at both ends of the spectrum. At one end we
have the MIT Media Lab biomechatronics group (MIT Media Lab) which has done extensive research on the
augmentation front in ways to power a prosthetic knee (MIT Media Lab) and even have engineers who have
built their own bionic leg (MIT Media Lab, 2019). At the other end of replacement, they also have teams
creating a more cost-effective prosthetic knee which is powered only by springs and gears. (MIT News, 2015)
(MIT GEAR Lab) (Chu, 2015)

   In addition to MIT, some of the top biomechatronics researchers include the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab
(Shirley Ryan AbilityLab) the University of California at Berkeley (University of California at Berkeley),
Stanford University (Stanford University), and University of Twente in the Netherlands (University of
Twente, 2020). These researchers have been focusing on the critical data gathering necessary to make
functioning replacements. This data gathering includes analyzing the complex human motions, determining
how to interface electronic components to the human nervous system and experimenting with living muscle
tissues as potential actuators for electronic devices.

While replacement of missing limbs is one approach for allowing people to use them again, when a limb or part
of the body becomes paralyzed, another approach to regain use is through an exoskeleton. While this seems like
it may be a new technology, in fact the concept of an exoskeleton was first patented in 1890 by Russian inventor
Nicholas Yagn (YAGN, 1890). This early exoskeleton was designed as an Augmentation to walking, running,
and jumping powered by a combination of springs and compressed fluid. Almost 20 years later, Leslie Kelley
patented the Pedomotor (Kelley, 1919) which used steam power to augment human motion with artificial
ligaments. Since then, there have been many attempts at exoskeletons as can be seen in Figure 16. (Qui, Pei, &
Wang, 2022)

   More modern research and development of exoskeletons can be split into either rehabilitation (e.g.,
Replacement) or assistance (Augmentation) (de la Tejera, Bustamante-Bello, Ramirez-Mendoza, & Izquierdo-
Reyes, 2020). The Military is a major source of research into this technology both to provide recovery to
veterans wounded on the battlefield and to augment the abilities of soldiers enabling them to carry more, move
faster and avoid fatigue. Some of the recent efforts can be seen in Figure 1-7. (Qui, Pei, & Wang, 2022)

   While many of these exoskeletons are far beyond the reach of the average consumer, some of the research has
resulted in products that are being targeted at people who wish to extend their travel and adventuring range.
One such product is the Shift Robotics AI powered Moonwalker shoes which are designed to allow a person
to walk 250% faster (Figure 18). (Shift Robotics, 2023). Another crowdfunded product is also an AI powered
device - the Hypershell Exoskeleton which is designed to give a person 25KM or range offsetting 30KG of
weight. (Figure 19) (Hypershell, 2023). In the mid-range offering is the suitX exoskeleton which both enables
a paraplegic individual to walk (Ashley, 2017) and is targeted to industry to augment a person doing their daily
tasks by reducing the muscle strain of heavy lifting and increasing the endurance of the individual using the
suit. (Ottobock, 2021)

GIANT EXOSKELETONS
No discussion of exoskeletons can be had without looking at the giant robots that are created for recreational
purposes. Although not technically an exoskeleton, the largest moving robot mech in the world is the 18 meter
(59ft) tall "life-size" Gundam RX-78 (Figure 110) in Yokohama, Japan (Japan, 2020). For Transformers fans,
The J-deite RIDE is a 4 meter (13 foot) tall transforming robot that converts from a drivable car to a walking
robot (Figure 111). (BRAVE ROBOTICS Inc., 2018)

   When someone wants to push the limits of an exoskeleton, think no further than what was built to compete
in a robot duel. At 13 feet tall, weighing in at 4 metric tons (12,000 pounds) Kuratas (Kuritas, 2023) (HT
Tech, 2021) was built by the Japanese company Suidobashi Heavy Industry (Figure 112) . Kuritas participated
in a match defeating Megabots Mark II and then tap out when Megabots Eagle One's chainsaw ripped into
Kuritas's arm on October 17, 2017 (Carter, 2017). For a while they even offered the robot for sale on Amazon
in Japan for the tidy sum of 120 million yen (US$1,008,000). (Baseel, 2015)

   Another exoskeleton robot was built by Taguchi Industrial Co., Ltd - the Super Guzzilla (Figure 113)
which features their Guzzilla series concrete crusher claws. (Taguchi Industrial, 2023). This robot stands four
meters (13.1 feet) tall and weighs 15 metric tons (33,000 pounds). When members of the public were given
an opportunity to sit inside Super Guzzilla, they were given a virtual experience through an Oculus Rift VR
headset with the actual robot controls driving the virtual robot. (Baseel, 2015)

EXTRA BODY PARTS
Where prosthetics get to be more interesting is when they are used to add an additional body part to assist in a
function. Anyone who has soldered an electronic circuit has always wished for a third hand. For those wanting
an extra thumb, Dani Clode at Cambridge University created a 3D-printed thumb that can be added to any
hand. (Amoruso, et al., 2022) (Figure 114). Other uses envisioned are a surgeon who wants to hold a camera
while doing shoulder surgery so that they can control where it points instead of having to rely on an assistant.
(Davis, 2023)

3D PRINTING BIO PARTS
While prosthetics and exoskeletons can help with a missing or non-functioning limb, internal organs require a
completely different approach for replacement. Transplanting an organ from another human requires careful
type matching and immunosuppression treatment in order to prevent rejection of that organ. Some inroads in
a machine to replace an organ have been made for the heart as well as external organs such as the kidney with
a dialysis machine. However, the advent of rapid prototyping and bio materials offers an opportunity to create
replacement organs which can be created from the recipient's own cells. (Wang, 2019) (Wikipedia, 2023)

   The bioengineers at Stanford University have been looking at how to approach building a human heart.
(Levin, 2022) They start with modified stem cells processed through a centrifuge into a paste-like substance
that is then printed into a gelatinous 3D structure (Figure 115). While the bio printers being used at the

research level can be quite costly, a team of students from Ludwigs-Maximillians-Universität and the
Technische Universität München won the 2016 Hackaday Prize when they repurposed a low-end Ultimaker
2+ 3D printer with a syringe to show how it can be used for 3D Bioprinting. (Hofmann, 2016). In 2012,
students in the University of Patras, Greece collaborated in modifying an Anet A8 3D printer (Figure 116) to
3D print stem cells cultivated from wild mice. (Melanie, Markus, Phillipp, & Oliver, 2019)

MODIFYING THE BODY FROM THE INSIDE

It is one thing to manufacture a part outside the body and insert it, but we want to think about how machines
could inhabit our body and automatically repair it. One approach to repairing the body is the use of hydrogels
that are injected into targeted areas to assist the natural body repair mechanisms or even replace diseased tissues.
Researchers at MIT and Harvard university have been working on models for how these granular hydrogels
                                                           THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE - MERGING WITH MACHINES [TOEBES] | 141

can be used both in 3D Bioprinting and injected into tissue. (Trafton, 2023) (Verheyen, Uzel, Kurum, Roche,
& Lewis, 20223)

   The next step is to have the 3D printer work inside the body to 3D print living cells directly on top of an
organ. Researchers as UNSW Sydney Australia have developed 3D printer with a soft printer head (Figure
117) that can be inserted endoscopically and print directly inside the body. (Firtina, 2023)(Thai, et al., 2023)

                                      Figure 117: 3D Printing inside the body

The extreme version of this is a series of tiny machines that live in our body fixing whatever they find is

wrong. This is the realm of Nanorobotics (Nanorobotics, 2023) and Nanomedicine (Nanomedicine, 2023)

with active research driven by the National Nanotechnology Initiative (National Nanotechnology
142 | THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE - MERGING WITH MACHINES [TOEBES]

Coordination Office, 2023). While a general purpose nanobot for the human body is not currently available,
this targeted research includes using nanoparticles to deliver medication directly to cancer cells (Aggarwal &
Kumar, 2022) and regeneration of bone and tissue. (National Nanotechnology Coordination Office, 2023)

   In order to perform their functions, these nanoscale robotic devices need to be able to move effectively
through the body. There are multiple strategies for creating these nanomotors including 3D Printing,
microfluid spinning, integration of biological and synthetic materials and using a porous polymer template as a
scaffold (Figure 118) (Liu, Gao, & Peng, 2022). In addition to being able to move through the body to target
a particular cell or set of cells, nanoscale robots can also be used to help regulate the growth and differentiation
of cells.

   Another approach for nanorobots in the body is to provide the power from outside the body in order to
control where the treatment is to be applied. (Soon, et al., 2023). These untethered robots can be directed to

a specific location with one frequency of a magnetic field and then switch into a heating mode when a higher
frequency is applied. (Figure 119)

BIOHACKING

Instead of waiting for the mainstream to catch up, some individuals have chosen to modify their own body in
a process known as biohacking which involves the process of infusing technological components into the body
144 | THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE - MERGING WITH MACHINES [TOEBES]

or by introducing chemical components in order to modify DNA. What is key here is that these modifications
are done using therapies and technology which has not gone through any governmental certification.
BIOHACKING - IMPLANTS
Implanting a device or magnet into an arm or hand is one of the simplest forms of biohacking. Steve Haworth is
considered a pioneer in the field, implanting magnets into his body over 30 years ago and creating instruments
for others to follow in his path. (Haworth, 2023) With a magnet, the individual can sense other magnetic
objects and fields (including microwaves) and pick up small pieces of metal (Figure 120). A challenge with
implanting magnets is that they can degrade over time reducing the function of the magnet and the sense that
it brings. (Robertson, 2017).

                        Figure 120: Picking up a paper clip with an implanted magnet

   By 1mrln - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=115315463
   A similar problem comes when embedding an RFID tag or other Near Field technology. A Hackaday.io
project from 2014 promises to turn you into a "bionic superhero" by implanting a small device into the
arm to provide communication with the outside world. (txyz.info, 2014). It is also possible to purchase an
NFC Implant for under the skin - a crowdfunded Indegogo campaign in 2013 resulted in the production
                                                           THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE - MERGING WITH MACHINES [TOEBES] | 145

of the Dangerous Things xNT NFC chip implant that allows sharing data with NFC enabled smart
phones (Dangerous Things, 2019). However, as the technology of the world continues to evolve, the
implanted device is limited to accessing devices of the era when it was first implanted. For a person to be able
to use their hand to pay for something in a contactless manner requires both a change in technology and
agreements with the EMV contactless payment companies. (Graafstra, 2017)

   Another problem to be aware of with any device under the skin is the potential for damage to the device or
the body around it. After biohacker Lepht Anonym had a file sharing device with a WiFi antenna implanted
in her arm, she accidentally damaged it when she hit her arm on the door of a taxi and had to have it removed
because of the irritation to her skin. (Teresa, 2022).

                        Figure 121: Project Bionic Yourself (B10N1C) implant in arm

   When thinking about device obsolescence, in 2015 the World Economic Forum published a report
expecting that implantable cell phones will be commercially available by 2023. (Global Agenda Councel on
the Future of Software & Society, 2015). While that hasn't happened, Marty Cooper, who is credited with
inventing the first phone in 1973, recently stated that one day we will have phone devices embedded under our
skin. (Browne, 2023). We shall leave what happens when it is time to upgrade the device as an exercise for the
reader.

BIOHACKING - DNA

With implanted devices, there is always the option to remove the device. Another approach to biohacking is
to target changing the body DNA. Despite all the peril of this form of DIY Gene Therapy, people continue to
experiment with it, but often with disastrous results. (Schroeder, 2022) (Zhang, 2018). The use of CRISPR
has made it easier for individuals to experiment with genetic engineering to the point that California has
clamped down on the sale of kits for injection into individuals. To avoid such government oversight, a biotech
startup called Minicircle that wants do to a clinical trial of gene therapy aimed at increasing longevity turned
to using NFTs for access to trials in an experimental crypto city in Próspera, Honduras. (Clarke, 2023)

CONNECTING THE BODY

Not every connection to the machines around us requires implanting or modifying the body. Some technology
can be done directly through the skin. Users of smart watches are already familiar with the ability to monitor
body functions (heart rate, sleep tracking, blood oxygen and temperature). Another way to connect to the
outside world is through a tattoo constructed of nanowires on top of a graphene aerogel conductive ink to
allow for passive wireless communication to nearby devices without the need for an external power source
similar to an RFID tag (Goth, 2023).

   For detailed monitoring of muscle activity such as tracking a sports injury or the progress of a disease,
researchers from six universities collaborated to create a soft wearable ultrasound sensor (Figure 122) that can
monitor over an inch and a half deep into the skin. (Halfacree, 2023)

READING THE BRAIN
The ultimate interface to the machines of the world is being able to control it with our thoughts. One of the
most promising: Mary Lou Jepsen's OpenWater mind reader is a non-invasive technology that uses light to
reconstruct the activity in the brain. (Fazekas, How does OpenWater's mind reader work?!, 2019). This allows
for a form of telepathy such that thoughts of one individual can be transmitted to another. (Sánchez, 2023).
An early experiment showing that this is possible was done in Barcelona in 2014 in which information read
from one subject's brain was encoded as a Baconian cipher encoded information and transmitted to another
subject over 7,000 kilometers away to be successfully received. (Figure 123) (Grau, et al., 2014)

                                      Figure 123: 2014 Telepathy Experiment

   Over 10 years ago, Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have shown that using functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) combined with some specialized computational models, they were able
to reconstruct movie clips of what the person is viewing. (Anwar, 2011). More recently, researchers at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne were able to use AI to predict (Schneider, Lee, & Mathis, 2023) the
next frame in a video by monitoring the brains of mice watching the film. (Sharma, 2023)

   More recently, the advances in A.I. Large language Models have enabled scientists to use non-invasive brain
imaging to reveal the movies in our mind. By recording brain activity while a subject watches a movie the
A.I. (based on GPT-1) can construct sentences which describe what the person is seeing. To be successful, it
does require cooperation of the subject both during the training session and when determining what they are
watching. (Whang, 2023)

   Elon Musk has taken a more invasive approach to mind reading with the Neuralink device. It consists of a
battery-operated device (rechargeable from outside the body) with 1024 electrodes that record neural activity.
These electrodes are so fine that it requires a custom surgical robot to perform the implant operation. (Figure
125) (Fazekas, Neuralink, OpenWater, DARPA N3, aka how far is the full-immersive (MATRIX style) virtual
reality?!, 2019). The FDA has approved the Neuralink for clinical studios (Levy, Taylor, & Sharma, 2023) but
nobody has reported being implanted yet.

   Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Vision
                                                           THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE - MERGING WITH MACHINES [TOEBES] | 151

   While the brain interface is still in development, Augmented/Virtual Reality hardware and applications are
in active development. From a visual perspective with AR, the user gets to see virtual objects and information
overlaid on top of the real-world environment. A key feature to make this work is processing power to track the
eye and head movements to ensure that the overlaid information matches with the physical world. Switching
to a VR mode involves cutting off the visible portions of the real world and replacing it with a completely
synthetic world.

   With an initial focus on gaming there are four major players in the AR/VR vision market today:

 1. Microsoft HoloLens 2 - These goggles provide hand tracking, eye tracking and spatial mapping of the
      environment to allow the user to see and interact with virtual objects in the real environment.
      (Microsoft, 2023)

 2. Magic Leap ML2 - Currently the lightest of the goggles, it also provides a dimming mode which allow
      highlighting the virtual objects in an AR mode.(Magic Leap 2, 2023)

 3. Meta Quest Pro - Focused more heavily as a VR platform to allow users to collaborate in a Mixed
      Reality environment (Meta Quest Pro, 2023)

 4. Apple Vision Pro - The newest platform which hasn't been released yet, it focuses on merging digital
      content into your physical space, offering multiple virtual monitors to interact with content (Apple
      Vision Pro, 2023)

The use of AR goggles isn't necessarily limited to what a user can see. Researchers at MIT have modified
a Microsoft Hololens headset to provide the wearer with a form of X-Ray Vision to enable the retail and
warehouse workers locate items much faster. (LANDYMORE, 2023)

   Another specialized form of Virtual Reality is the Sol Reader which focuses solely on providing an
environment simply to read a book blocking out everything else. (Kamp, 2023)

OTHER SENSES IN VR

While VR goggles can go a long way to immersing a person in an environment, the other senses need to
perceive being there. Sound is the easiest through headphones giving spatial audio so that the user perceives the
location of the object which makes the sound.

   Motion in a VR world is one of the more challenging to pull off. To this end, there are multiple companies
creating VR treadmills (Figure 126) which allow users to move around freely in a virtual environment while
keeping them in the same safe location in the physical world. (Virtuix Omni One, 2023). These devices work
by tethering the user on top of a platform which allows the user to walk, run, jump, and even swim by tracking
the motion of the arms and legs.

                                   Figure 126: Virtuix Omni One VR Treadmill

   For touch, there are haptic gloves which not only track the hand motion but can provide tactile feedback
so that the wearer can sense the objects that they are touching in the virtual world. (HaptX Gloves G1, 2023)
(Figure 127). To fully experience the pressure and sounds of the environment, users can wear a haptic vest
with speakers and motors and even electric shocks to provide feedback to other parts of the body, including a
sensation of being attacked while playing a game. (Wöbbeking, 2023)

   The hardest sense to fool is smell. This concept of "smell-o-vision" is difficult to accomplish because of the
wide range of chemicals which the human nose can distinguish. As such, most attempts to provide scent to VR
involve a limited number of scents typically generated by heating a scented wax. (Donlevy, 2023) (Whit, 2023)

   The last sense of course is taste. Unfortunately taste depends very heavily on the sense of smell in addition
to the sensors in the tongue. A leading researcher Nimesha Ranasinghe at the University of Maine has been
fooling the tongue through the use of electrodes stimulating specific parts of the tongue. (Using Electric
Currents to Fool Ourselves Into Tasting Something We're Not, 2017).
AVATARS
These technologies combine to provide for the ultimate pairing of humans and machines - an avatar that
154 | THE TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURE - MERGING WITH MACHINES [TOEBES]

allows a human to be tele-present in a robot at a separate location. This is a VR environment for a person which
is fed by sensors on the remote robot. This avatar is useful in environments where a human could not survive,
such as deep under water, in the vacuum of space, or on a remote planet with a hostile environment.

   Recognizing the need for the technology, the XPrize foundation held an Avatar competition with $10M
in prize money (XPrize Avatar Competition, 2023). In November 2022, 17 teams from around the world
competed with judges operating the telepresence robots in a simulated space station on an alien planet. The
judge had to use the avatar to complete tasks including flipping switches, navigating an obstacle course,
identifying a container by wright, operate a drill and even determine whether a rock is smooth or rough by
touch. (Ackerman, 2023)

CONCLUSIONS

There are many ways in which we can integrate with the machines and computers of the world. Advancements
in A.I and 3D Printing over the past decade have accelerated the rate at which we replace, augment, and connect
our bodies to connect with the world.

QUESTIONS FOR STUDENTS

How do you draw the line for when a Replacement part becomes an Augmentation?
At what point in time does the ability an Augmentation provides become a concern for society?

TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND
HUMANITY [LONSTEIN]

STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES

This chapter asks the student to dive deeply into a growing concern, have we become intoxicated, infatuated,
and incapacitated by the abundance of technology in our lives? While most students have not enjoyed using
a rotary phone, atlas, listening to AM or FM radio, using a Citizens Band Radio, or navigating without
technology, they have grown up in a world of incredible innovation. Every aspect of our public and private lives
is now touched by, if not run by, technology. So, the questions must be asked by everyone, how much is too
much technology, and just because the technology exists to replace manual, human-run processes (Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning Automation), does it mean it should?

INTRODUCTION

In 2018, ye author authored an article in Forbes entitled "Governments and Businesses Are Becoming
Inebriated by Technology" as a warning to society that the rapid technological developments in the last
ten years are causing a dangerous over-reliance upon it. I created a term meant to capsulize the challenge
confronting an increasingly technology-dependent society: "Intechication." (Lonstein, 2018)

   While overwhelmed by a myriad of new technologies such as Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence
("AI"), and Machine Learning ("ML"), to name a few, the blinding speed of advancements over the last five
years should cause all of us to question not only dream of the possible benefits but also consider inherent risks
of each as well as the consequence of combining technologies. For example, combining Social Media with the
speed and scale of Quantum Computing and AL poses a formidable risk of widespread information warfare
campaigns, which would be difficult, if not impossible, to contain. Where do we start? Is it too late? As Ian
Malcolm (Portrayed by Jeff Goldblum), the lead in Michael Crichton's novel - turned blockbuster movie,
Jurassic Park, put it, "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if
they should." (Speilberg, 1993)

   In a world emerging from a pandemic that, according to the World Health Organization, has caused seven
million deaths globally as of April 2023 (World Health Organization, 2023), the first glimpses of a new
type of pandemic are already present, instant global disinformation and misinformation campaigns on social
                                                                             TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN] | 163

media and elsewhere online. During the pandemic, numerous state-sponsored and private bot farms flooded
social media and the broader internet with allegedly unsubstantiated claims, data, and theories, which caused
widespread fear, doubt, protests, and even violence. (Himelein-Wachowiak, 2021)

2021)

   The ability to automate and replicate content in social and online media may be an insurmountable
problem, but what if the AI-fueled bots were using claiming content was disinformation - misinformation
when it was legitimate dissent, opinion, or even factual?
NEW TECHNOLOGY - SAME OLD HUMANS: GUNS, EXPLOSIVES, BIOLOGICS,
CHEMICALS, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND CYBER
The introduction of groundbreaking new technologies is not something that is unique to the 20th and 21st
centuries; in fact, some inventions were unintended by-products of research aimed to address entirely different
issues. Gunpowder: one of the most important technological developments in history was a result of research
designed to find a life-extending elixir by the Chinese somewhere between the eighth and ninth century A.D.
164 | TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN]

At the direction of the first Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang, researchers travelled far and wide to discover
or create what was a tool for immortality. The researchers first discovered the element Potassium Nitrate
(also known as saltpeter) combined with honey to create a healing smoke or Sulphur to create a healing
salve. (Xinhua Net, 2017) (Ling, 1947)

   After that, researchers discovered some other properties of Potassium nitrate leading to experiments that
combined it with Charcoal and Sulphur, which created the first forms of what we now call gunpowder.
(Shepherd, 2022) Over the centuries, gunpowder or its elements have been used to heal, kill, conquer, and
create, depending on how the possessor used it. Similarly, the gun, a by-product of the discovery of gunpowder,
has also been used to protect, purloin, conquer, defend, kill, hunt, feed, and or save lives. With further
development, firearms became lighter, more powerful, affordable, and available. While the use of technology
in service to the public or nation is one thing, the challenges of gun ownership and use by individuals are quite
another. The use of guns in warfare made it clear that their use by individuals and the challenges it presented
required governments to enact laws governing their use and ownership from as early as 1689. Century. (Satia,
2019)When placing military-grade, powerful technology in the hands of humans increases the risk of its
misuse. Unlike nations and organizations where, in most instances, [1]some degree of debate, consultation,
and risk assessment takes place among leadership, its use by an individual does not necessarily have the same
type of braking mechanisms.

   Put another way, "There is no legislation that will strip evil from an immoral man," by San Diego
Gun Owners PAC Board member Warren Manfredi after the 2017-gun massacre at a concert in Las Vegas,
Nevada.

   The misuse of guns, explosives and other technological innovations in scale can lead to tragic and gut-
wrenching results. Here are a few tragic examples:

GUNS

Las Vegas Shooting, 61 killed over 800 injured.

 1. Pulse Orlando nightclub in Orlando, Fla. (June 12, 2016) - 49 killed, over 50 wounded.
 2. Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. (April 16, 2007) - 32 killed, over 17 injured
 3. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. (Dec. 14, 2012), 26 killed ( mostly children)
 4. Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas (Oct. 16, 1991), 23 killed. (Peralta, 2016)

EXPLOSIVES

 1. Oklahoma City Bombing, Federal Court House, Oklahoma City, Ok April 19, 1996
 2. World Trade Center, February 26, 1993, New York, NY 6 killed, over 1000 killed
 3. Boston Marathon Bombing, Boston, Ma April 15, 2013, 3 killed, over 100 injured.

 5. Haymarket Square, Chicago Il. May 4, 1886, 11 killed, over 100 killed.(National Academies of Sciences,

      Engineering, and Medicine, 2018)

BIOLOGICS AND CHEMICALS

Alphabet Bomber, Los Angeles, CA 1974, attempted attacks planned by a group including Muharem
Kubergovic, who was arrested with 20 pounds of cyanide gas.

 1. Followers of Bhagwan Shri Rashneesh placed homegrown salmonella bacteria on supermarket produce,
      salad bars, and other location in Oregon in 1984. Seven hundred fifty-one people fell ill from the attack,
      intended to affect a local election.

 2. In 1994 and 1995, a test and follow-up attack occurred in Matsumoto (7 deaths and 500 injuries) and
      Tokyo Japan subway system (12 dead and thousands injured) using nerve gas. According to reports, the
      Aum Shinrikyo cult was also trying to develop or acquire Botulism and Ebola virus for use in weapons.

CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL TECHNOLOGY WEAPONIZATION

 1. The September 11th, 2001, attacks using a box cutter to hijack and crash commercial airliners into the
      World Trade Center in New York City, NY, The Pentagon in Arlington, VA., and a crashed plane in
      Shanksville, PA. Almost 3,000 died on the attack date, thousands more died from 9/11 cleanup
      exposure diseases, and thousands more were injured.

 2. In May 2021, consumer drones were sued for supplying drugs, guns, phones, and cash to a Lee County,
      South Carolina prison. (Robinson, 2022)

INTERNET & SOCIAL MEDIA

 1. The September 11, 2001, attacks: According to the United States Department of Justice, "Evidence
      strongly suggests that terrorists used the Internet to plan their operations and attacks on the United
      States on September 11, 2001. " (Thomas, 2003)

 2. Colonial Pipeline Attack, In May 2021, hackers using connectivity commenced a ransomware attack
      Colonial Pipeline was the target of a ransomware assault exploiting an insecure VPN, which shut it
      down for several days in 2021. The attack resulted in a significant nationwide fuel supply disruption and
      caused considerable price increases and long lines at gas stations. (United States Senate Committee on
      Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, 2021)Figure 2-3 (Courtesy Jim Lo Scalzo, EPA) (EPA, J.

 3. Arab Spring., December 2020 "The internet and social media were vital tools for mobilizing Arab
      Spring protesters and documenting some government injustices." (Robinson K., 2020)

 4. In a case of alleged cryptocurrency financing of terrorist groups in Syria, Victoria Jacobs, a/k/a Bakhrom
      Talipov, was indicted in February 2023; Jacobs allegedly laundered $10,661 on behalf of Malhama
      Tactical by receiving cryptocurrency and Western Union and MoneyGram wires from supporters
      around the globe and sending the funds to Bitcoin wallets controlled by Malhama Tactical. In addition
      to sending cryptocurrency, she also purchased Google Play gift cards for the organization, according to
      the indictment." (Katersky, 2023)

CAN TECHNOLOGY BE INHERENTLY EVIL?

In May 1927, Charles Lindbergh became a national hero and international celebrity. He was the first to fly
across the Atlantic, from Long Island, New York, to Paris, France, non-stop and by himself. (National Air
and Space Museum, 2023) With the heroic accomplishment came celebrity and, sadly, tragedy. In 1932 his
firstborn child Charles, Jr., was kidnapped on March 1, 1932, and found murdered on May 12, 1932, a few

miles away from the Lindbergh home. (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2023) Seeking to remove themselves
from the spotlight and media frenzy, the Lindbergh's moved to France.

   Still connected with flight, the U.S. Military asked Lindbergh to travel to Germany to assess the German
air assets. He made at least three trips to Germany between 1936 and 1939. Lindbergh, of German descent,
was awarded a medal known as the Commander Cross of the Order of the German Eagle on behalf of Adolph
Hitler by Hermann Göring. Understandably, there was outrage in the United States and elsewhere when
the story was published. Lindbergh discovered that his love of airplanes and the importance they introduced
could not attenuate the risks associated with their misuse. In his book Brave Companions, author David Mc
McCullough explained Lindbergh's epiphany this way; "The evil of technology was not in the technology
itself, Lindbergh came to see after the war, not in airplanes or the myriad contrivances of modern technical
ingenuity, but in the extent to which they can distance us from our better moral nature, our sense of personal
accountability." (Mc Cullough, 1992)

168 | TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN]

   In early 1945 President Harry Truman asked Secretary of War Henry Stimson to create and convene a Blue-
Ribbon committee to establish a set of recommendations for the use of atomic weapons during the late stages
of WWII as well as a policy for post-war use and security of this nascent and potent new technology. Of great
concern was the fear that the United States could not "maintain its monopoly" on the technology for long;
some members of the committee believed the way to prevent a post-war (Unites States Department of Energy,
2023)

   The constant friction between the tremendous power of nuclear weapons and the fear of misuse starts with
the Manhattan Project itself. The United States and its allies created the Manhattan Project in response to
information provided by intelligence and refugee scientists from Europe who informed the allies that Germany
was working on and close to perfecting a weapon of mass destruction that harnessed and used the immense
power of nuclear energy. (National WW II Museum, 2023) One particular friction associated with nuclear
technology in warfare was scientist Joseph Rotblat. Born in Poland, Rotblat studied science in the United
Kingdom and was part of a team that split the atom, which led to the ability to create a nuclear bomb. In light
of the widely held belief that Germany was working work to create a nuclear bomb, the race was on. Part of a
British team collaborating with the Americans, he eventually went to Los Alamos, New Mexico.

   While Rotblat was at Los Alamos, he discovered how enormous the project would be to make a nuclear
bomb. From this information, he became convinced that given the limitations of Germany in terms of talent,
money, and manpower, it would be impossible for Germany to create a nuclear bomb.

   Rotblat was interviewed as part of the History of the Atomic Heritage Foundation's "Voices of the
Manhattan Project" series in 1989.

   "I was becoming more and more unhappy about my participation in the project, even without Niels Bohr,
for the simple reason that I had begun to realize when I came to Los Alamos the enormity of the project, how
much it requires, the enormous manpower required, and the technological resources, to see how much money
went into there. Ignoring what was going on in Oak Ridge, Hanford, and Berkeley. There is this enormous
effort for the Americans to make the bomb."

   "I could see that the war was coming to an end in Europe, and still it did not look like the bomb would
be finished. We still had to grapple with basic issues like the implosion technique. But it became clear to me
that [it was] very unlikely the Germans would make the bomb. I did not believe that the Germans could really
produce something at less cost in this time, considering their involvement in the war [inaudible] was going on.

   It became clearer gradually that the Germans are not going to make the bomb. The only reason really why
I worked on the bomb was because of the fear of the Germans. This is the only reason. I would never have
worked on this otherwise. This is quite simple, and not to be swayed, [inaudible] my motivation for work on
the bomb was becoming invalid. But it was fortified by two events--well, not events. One was an event. This is
the remark made by General Groves, which I described.

   At that time, it was March of 1944, I was living with the Chadwick's, and Groves prepared to make a visit
                                                                             TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN] | 169

to Los Alamos. The notification was he would come to Chadwick's, because he had become very friendly with
Chadwick and would have dinner. Therefore, I was being a resident in the house, therefore I was also there.

   This struck in my mind, the shock of it. We had been talking of a general sort over dinner on sort of things.
It came down to the project. All of a sudden, he said, "You realize, of course, that one purpose of this
project is to subdue the Russians." To me it came as a terrible shock, because to me the whole premise of the
project was quite different." (Rotblat, Voices of the Manhattan Project, the Joseph Rotblat's Interview, 1989)

   In 1995 Rotblat, the Pugwash organization, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize "for their efforts to diminish
the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms."

   In his acceptance speech at 88, he challenged those who invent, research, work on or use new powerful
technologies. Is it a challenge that confronts all of us today and, most notably, today's students who will face
these existential considerations in the coming years?

   "But there are other areas of scientific research that may directly or indirectly lead to harm to society. This
calls for constant vigilance. The purpose of some government or industrial research is sometimes concealed,
and misleading information is presented to the public. It should be the duty of scientists to expose such
malfeasance. "Whistleblowing" should become part of the scientist's ethos. This may bring reprisals; a price
to be paid for one's convictions. The price may be very heavy, as illustrated by the disproportionately severe
punishment of Mordechai Vanunu. I believe he has suffered enough.

   The time has come to formulate guidelines for the ethical conduct of scientist, in the form of a voluntary
Hippocratic Oath. This would be particularly valuable for young scientists when they embark on a scientific
career. The US Student Pugwash Group has taken up this idea - and that is very heartening.

   At a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society, when the destiny of the whole of
mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research, it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of
that role and conduct themselves accordingly. I appeal to my fellow scientists to remember their responsibility
to humanity." (Nobel Prize Outreach, 2023)

   In December 1946, Dr. Karl T. Compton authored an article in the Atlantic Magazine entitled "If the
Atomic Bomb Had Not Been Used, Was Japan already beaten before the August 1945 Bombings?" As part of
the article, he wrote about his interrogation of a senior Japanese Military Official who survived the bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had not occurred; what would Japan have done? He answered:
   "You would probably have tried to invade our homeland with a landing operation on Kyushu about
November 1. I think the attack would have been made on such and such beaches.... It would have been a very
desperate fight, but I do not think we could have stopped you.......... We would have kept on fighting until all
Japanese were killed, but we would not have been defeated," by which he meant that they would not have been
disgraced by surrender." (Compton, 1946)
   Dr. Sidney J. Stein was this author's Great Uncle. As a child, I would hear stories about this project he
worked on for the government, which was crucial in ending World War II. During my High School and
College years, we talked about the challenge of creating technology that can be used to kill massive numbers
of humans. His response was always one of pride and introspection. Like all the scientists who worked on
                                                                              TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN] | 171

the Manhattan Project, he knew the war had to end. Although none of us will ever know with certainty,
there is no dispute that an invasion Japanese mainland would exact a heavy toll upon Japan & the Japanese
people. Most scholars, military experts, and historians believe that the United States and its allies would have
also suffered enormous casualties and deaths. Estimates range from fifty thousand deaths in the initial ground
invasion alone (Compton, 1946) to tens of millions. (Jenkins, 2016)According to his Obituary written by
his son Michael, "Sid remembered hearing that the bombs had been dropped and that the Japanese had
surrendered. "We were thrilled knowing we had shortened the war and saved lives." Stein was decorated for his
work. As fate would have it, the company he founded in 1962, Electro Science Laboratories, maintained its
Asian headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, for decades, employing many Japanese citizens. (Stein, 2015)

ITS 2023 AND THE CONCERNS OF HUMAN MISUSE OF TECHNOLOGY GROWS

From Artificial Intelligence ("AI"), Machine Learning ("ML"), and Quantum Computing to Genomics,
Robotics, 3D Printing, and Virtual Reality, the world is seeing breakthroughs in technology at a breathtaking
pace.

   In 1950 Alan Turing, a mathematician and one of the first computer scientists, authored a paper entitled
"Computing and Intelligence." In the article, he sought to discuss and answer the question, can machines
think?

   Part of his hypothesis required a method to determine if the output of the machine or produced by a
human. To prove his hypothesis, he called for a human interrogator to examine the answers to questions
asked of humans and machines and determine whether a human or machine created the response. Turing
was particularly keen on an "infinite capacity computer." He envisioned what we might call today, Quantum
Computing, adding storage and processing capacity as needed depending on the amount of data ingested
and the processing capacity required for more complex information sets. He is widely considered one of the
progenitors of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. (Turing, 1950)

   Dr. Turning alluded to the infinite capacity and storage that would eventually become Moore's Law.
Gordon Moore, Co-Founder of what is today known as the Intel Corporation, postulated that the transistor
capacity of a chip doubles every two years, so does processing power. Simultaneously, as the number of
transistors increases, the cost per transistor falls, thereby reducing cost while allowing the processing power of
computer chips to grow exponentially. (Moore, 1965)

   AI and Quantum Computing gave rise to the fission-like explosive growth of automation, AI, and ML.
With this rapid development comes the challenge of misuse or mishap in scale. Although Robotics,
Automation, AI, and ML have already demonstrated the ability to improve our lives while presenting the
same existential threats as nuclear energy, electromagnetic pulse technology, lasers, and biological and chemical
agents, you name a few.

   One glance at any news source will undoubtedly contain reports of the many benefits of AI, ML, etc.,
and other stories about the threats these technologies may pose. Students and technology professionals will
be required to decide whether to use technology, how to use technology, limitations on the international,
national, commercial, and personal use of these new technologies, counter technologies, or other measures
to deal with the misuse, unintended. Whatever is written on these pages today will undoubtedly be outdated
months after publication. There is precious little we can accurately predict about ten or twenty years in the
future, much less twenty minutes from now. Therefore, this chapter intentionally does not focus on currently
perceived or known threats from technology; instead, our focus has been on what history has shown us and
what precautions, legislation, countermeasures, or detection methods can be implemented to prevent the risks
we know exist from becoming a reality. In no particular order, here are some examples of potential defenses.
                                                                             TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN] | 173

JUST BECAUSE WE CAN DOES NOT MEAN WE SHOULD
   As discussed throughout this chapter, Risk/Benefit analysis is essential before introducing such new

technologies into public, private, commercial, or defense environments. Since most AI technology available
today is Third Party ("TPAI") created, a significant analysis must be performed to assess the risks associated
with its use which has been referred to as Responsible Artificial Intelligence ("RAI"). To that end, the MIT
Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group surveyed 18 panelists involved in considering or
actually implementing TPAI
into their organizations.

                                          Figure 2-6 RAI Survey April 2023

   Source:(Courtesy MIT Sloan Management Review) (Renieris, 2023)
   As the small but instructive survey reveals, there needs to be more agreement or confidence in using RAI
to analyze the risks and benefits of TPAI. The people deciding whether TPAI is a sound, safe, and responsible
decision for their organization need to be more confident in their analytical tools or processes; how can they
implement the technology ethically?
174 | TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN]

WHAT ARE THE ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS?

Given the nascent state of the use of AI, ML, and other new technology, and the rapid rate of their
development and implementation, the concepts of law, ethics, and morality of specific use cases and scenarios
are taking a back seat. However, this is not to say that no guiding principles exist making creating, using,
or restricting the use of AI, ML, or their progeny. Isaac Asimov was a Russian Immigrant to America who
eventually served as a biochemistry professor at Boston University. In addition, he was a prolific writer who
became enamored with science fiction as a child by reading small "pulp" magazines on this subject in his
family's candy store. Later on

   Asimov wrote a series of short stories and novels between 1940 and 1945, eventually including them in his
1950 compilation entitled I, Robot. One story, written in 1941, was entitled "Runaround." In Runaround,
Asimov introduced the "Three Laws of Robotics," also known as Asimov's Law.

  FIRST LAW: A ROBOT MAY NOT INJURE A HUMAN BEING OR, THROUGH INACTION,
                              ALLOW A HUMAN BEING TO COME TO HARM.

    SECOND LAW: A ROBOT MUST OBEY THE ORDERS GIVEN TO IT BY HUMAN BEINGS
           EXCEPT WHERE SUCH ORDERS WOULD CONFLICT WITH THE FIRST LAW.

      THIRD LAW: A ROBOT MUST PROTECT ITS OWN EXISTENCE AS LONG AS SUCH
 PROTECTION DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THE FIRST OR SECOND LAWS. (ASIMOV, 1942)

The fact that Asimov created his laws for robots' points to a more critical issue, whether technology or human,
which needs regulation. Suppose technology could self-determine how its use; it could be engineered to have
internal self-limitations to prevent misuse. A case in point is firearms. For as long as they have existed, guns have
been used in war, law enforcement, and self-defense. The Second Amendment to United States Constitution.
(United States of America, 1791) establishes the right to own (bear") arms. For the same period, firearms have
been misused or accidentally used in a way society finds unacceptable. According to the Judicial Learning
Center: "Laws are rules that bind all people living in a community. Laws protect our general safety and ensure
our rights as citizens against abuses by other people, by organizations, and by the government itself. We have
laws to help provide for our general safety." (Judicial Learning Center, 2019)

   What happens when these laws and regulations are broken or violated, and a person has been proven guilty
of the offense? [2] Does a punishment regime exist? Why is there punishment? The four primary philosophical
reasons for punishment in a system of laws are:

RETRIBUTION: PUNISHMENT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF RETRIBUTION WHEN IT SIMPLY
 RETALIATES (OR GETS EVEN) BY INFLICTING PAIN OR DISCOMFORT PROPORTIONATE
                                                  TO THE OFFENSE.

 INCAPACITATION: PUNISHMENT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF INCAPACITATION WHEN IT
       PREVENTS OFFENDERS FROM BEING ABLE TO REPEAT AN OFFENSE. THE MOST
                                                                             TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN] | 175

               POPULAR FORM OF INCAPACITATION TODAY IS INCARCERATION.
 DETERRENCE: PUNISHMENT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF DETERRENCE WHEN IT CAUSES

       OFFENDERS TO REFRAIN FROM COMMITTING OFFENSES AGAIN (INDIVIDUAL
     DETERRENCE) OR WHEN IT SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE THAT KEEPS OTHERS FROM

                     COMMITTING CRIMINAL ACTS (GENERAL DETERRENCE).
    REHABILITATION: THE PURPOSE OF REHABILITATION IS TO CHANGE OFFENDERS

                      THROUGH PROPER TREATMENT. (CHERRINGTON, 2007)
The greatest challenge in regulating AI, ML, and similar technologies is the new reality of scale and speed. As of
this writing, AI through consumer products such as ChatGPT is already increasing and will require more work
to regulate effectively. Students will undoubtedly be confronted with the challenge of resolving these and many
more ethical and legal challenges presented by AI, ML, and other self-developing autonomous technology.
The most vexing challenge may not be whether humans will obey the laws created to regulate technology but
whether and how long it will take them to decide to abide by them.

COUNTER -AI

The final and most important part of our discussion deals with the reality that when, not if AI, ML, or
similar technology goes awry or becomes a hacker itself? No less than the esteemed Cryptography expert Bruce
Schneier distilled the problem this way:

   "There are really two different but related problems here. The first is that an AI might be instructed to hack
a system. Someone might feed an AI the world's tax codes or the world's financial regulations, with the intent
of having it create a slew of profitable hacks. The other is that an AI might naturally, albeit inadvertently, hack
a system. Both are dangerous, but the second is more dangerous because we might never know it happened."
(Schneier, 2021)

   The risk of conflict increases with the world's nations all racing to become the leader in AI technology.
Governments and non-state actors are experimenting with its capabilities. The experiments may cause
unexpected results or even work cause unintended harm. Much like crowded airspace in a war zone, the risk of
conflict is already significant, and the risk of accidental events causing conflict may be even greater. Even the
intended results of the testing and implementing various AI technology by one nation might be deemed an
existential threat by another, which, in turn, could create a scenario where virtual technology leads to kinetic
engagement. The risk of an AI failure, attack, or unexpected result exists from pipelines to power plants and
air travel to atomic energy. As more and more AI systems develop, the risk of unintended consequences grows.
Prudence dictates that the creation of Counter AI technology and protocols happens rapidly. Professor M.
A. Thomas of the United States Army Scholl of Advanced Military Studies described the urgent challenge to
develop Counter AI systems this way:

   "The singular strategic focus on gaining and maintaining leadership
   And the metaphor of an "arms race" is unhelpful, however.
   Races are unidimensional, and the winner takes all.
   Previous arms races in long-range naval artillery or nuclear weapons were
   predicated on the idea that advanced tech would create standoff, nullifying the effects of the adversary's
weapons and deterring attack. But AI is not unidimensional; it is a diverse collection of applications, from AI-
supported logistics and personnel systems to AI-enabled drones and autonomous vehicles. Nor does broadly
better tech necessarily create standoff, as the US military learned from improvised explosive devices in
Afghanistan. This means that in addition to improving its own capabilities, the United States must be able
to respond effectively to the capabilities of others. In addition to its artificial intelligence strategy, the United
States needs a counter-AI strategy." (Thomas M. A., 2020)

CONCLUSIONS

We are living through the beginning of an unprecedented development period of new technology of power
and speed never before seen. Indeed, the introduction of atomic weapons was earth-shattering at the time.
                                                                             TECHNOLOGY, ETHICS, LAW AND HUMANITY [LONSTEIN] | 177

However, its development took many years and thousands of people to perfect. With AI and automation
technology, the need for thousands of humans, many, if not all, endeavors of discovery or invention may
decrease to only a few or none. It is the hope of this author and the members of the Wildcat Team that students
and those professionals who read it use it as a call to action. The promise and danger of this new technology
are both unlike anything the world has previously witnessed. With that tremendous power comes challenge,
and like it or not, the burden of finding answers to the questions raised in this chapter and in this book will fall
upon its reader. Here is wishing Godspeed to all those who take on the challenge, and may their efforts result
in a safer and more peaceful world.

[1] It is not lost on the author that many nations and groups have used and abused in ways that most
humanities found offensive, improper, and inhumane. Hitler, Pol Pot, and Stalin misused powerful
technologies most brutally and horrifically, leading to the deaths of millions of innocents. Tyranny, mental
illness, and cults are examples where group oversight, consideration, and debate failed... (San Diego County

ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM]

STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES
The student will gain knowledge of the concepts and framework related to the current and future uses of
human systems as related to the artificial brain and body (form factor), along with an assessment of how these
autonomous systems are integrated into the world around us.
WHY ARE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS/ROBOTS IN THE FORM FACTOR OF HUMANS?
What is a body, and what is its purpose? Why do humans feel it is necessary to make all things conform to their
relatively limited functional world? The fact that humans have opposable thumbs and can manipulate items
in their environment better than a dog or a dolphin does not mean that our human environment is the most
effective or efficient for getting work done or even for human happiness.

   A limitation of the form factor for robots can become an obstacle to forward progression, as humans must
unlearn their environment and learn through the lens of a robot's point of view. Unfortunately, most of our
world is set up to work within human limitations as humans must adapt to dull, dirty, or dangerous activities,
yet robots thrive in these spaces.

   The definition of the body when we are referring to a human is "the organized physical substance of an
animal or plant either living or dead, the material part or nature of a human being" (Merriam-Webster.,
2023). Yet when we examine the human counterpart in a humanoid autonomous system, the definition is "A
humanoid is a robot with a human-like appearance that allows interaction with tools or environments made
for humans" (Khillar, 2020). Figure 3-2 provides a quick comparison of characteristics between humanoids
and robots.

                             Figure 3-2: Comparison Chart of Humanoid vs. Robot

   "Robots have become humanoid robots with a human-like shape. The drive to create smart and intelligent
human-like artificial machines has led to the development of humanoids" (Khillar, 2020).

   The purpose and capabilities of humanoid robots vary greatly; however, they can "adapt to its surroundings
and continue with its direction or command. Depending upon the size and weight, these robots have the
capability of self-maintenance and an advanced feature of autonomous learning; thus, they avoid harmful
situations to people, property, and themselves" (Bandakkanavar, 2021).

   The challenge of choosing whether to adapt the robot or humanoid to human surroundings or allow the
robot to learn and adapt its shape, form, and function to the human environment is still in debate. The issue
of how to give the robot proper feedback in any given environment or situation is still in the infant stages
and collecting information for feedback mechanisms is essential. How much information, what types of data,
and the amount of personal privacy of an individual balance against an autonomous robot's safe and optimal
operation is still being determined.

THE SUM OF ITS PARTS, THE BODY-WHAT IS THE OPTIMUM FORM FACTOR?
   Retrieving garbage from the sea can be a difficult and expensive task; typically undertaken with large

machines that grab, scoop, or attempt to capture debris in similar ways to humans' hands. However, the
human form may not be the best to emulate in delicate situations, and nature might offer a better shape to
mimic. So enters the robotic jellyfish. See Figures 3-3 and 3-4 for the advantages of robotic jellyfish and how
they have been designed.

                                Figure 3-3: Jellyfish might clean the ocean one day

   Source: (Jellyfish-like robots could one day clean up the world's oceans., 2023)

   Source: (Jellyfish-like robots could one day clean up the world's oceans., 2023)
   An undertaking by the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems has "discovered that the flapping
propulsion system of a robotic jellyfish is not only good for movement, but it can also draw small bits of debris
up from the ocean floor without any contact" (Franco, Robotic jellyfish can suck up ocean debris without
touching it. , 2023b). This non-invasive movement could be leveraged to clean unique, fragile surfaces such as
those found in coral reefs. (Franco, Robotic jellyfish can suck up ocean debris without touching it. , 2023b).
With an eye towards nature combined with robotics, processes that date back hundreds of years are now being
updated, changed, made more efficient, and sometimes even simplified.
   Brewing beer is one example of a natural chemical process that is being revised. "In order to speed up and
simplify the process, scientists have developed tiny BeerBots" (Coxworth, 2023).

                                       Figure 3-5: Beerbots help fermentation
186 | ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM]

   Source: (Coxworth, 2023)
   These Beer Bots "release carbon dioxide gas into the air, before sinking back down again. They repeat this
up-and-down process until all the sugars in the wort have been fermented" (Coxworth, 2023). Figure 3-5
illustrates BeerBots in action. BeerBots can be reused for up to three more fermentation cycles before being
discarded. Professor Martin Pumera, the creator of BeerBots, admits that it would be "difficult to scale up to
industrial use in its present form, so it may end up being utilized mainly by small-scale craft beer producers"
(Coxworth, 2023).
   Humans have had to learn to adapt to an animal-dominated world. It is "sometimes difficult to imagine how
the planet we call home, with its megalopolis cities and serene farmlands, was once dominated by dinosaurs as
big as buses and five-story buildings" (Reynolds, 2023).
   Nature evolves as it learns to survive and thrive in its surroundings. An example is the inside of an elephant
skull where there are large air sacs that allow the animal to move its massive head and heavy tusks without
straining the neck muscles. The human head must be able to move similarly to the elephant, yet the human
brain tends to be more delicate, and so it is protected by two layers of hard, compact bone (inner and outer
tables) ...known as the diploe" (Reynolds, 2023). How did animals and humans evolve in similar ways, yet be
so dissimilar to each other? This is due to something known as "convergent evolution in which animals are
faced repeatedly with the same problem, evolving similar - but not always identical - solutions each time"
(Reynolds, 2023).
   Animals evolved with vegetation, water, and different types of terrain. Then the animals had to develop
with humans and additional species of animals, all fighting for the same resources. Now humans, animals,
vegetation, waterways, and robots will be fighting for a balance in a resource-limited world. Robots and
                                                                                                       ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM] | 187

humans must now work through convergent evolutionary issues together, with little historical precedent to
fall back on. The unknowns of true AI, quantum, hybrid networks, hybrid humans, hybrid robots, and
integrated autonomous systems can harmonize humanity or result in chaos. Consider that this integration
and adaptation between humans, nature, and now robots will be made with little understanding of the long-
term outcomes or consequences. In an ever-changing world, convergent evolution could allow all involved to
flourish or fail during some or all of these adaptations.

   While considering the complexity of evolution, let us not forget that the next phase of human evolution will
be in space. Recently, Rolls Royce received a £2.9-million (US$3.5-million) contract from the United Kingdom
Space Agency. This contract was to develop a nuclear reactor prototype that would be part of a future lunar
outpost. The energy from the reactor must be sufficient to support everything necessary within the outpost,
including life support systems, communications systems, and any scientific fieldwork. The contract stipulates
that the prototype must be completed by 2029 (Szondy,2023). There is no doubt that this prototype will
include robotic assistance to monitor the power quality and numerous ancillary systems. The promise of
a lunar outpost means that humans and robots will need to adapt to a new environment that neither are
necessarily equipped to understand, work in, or be optimized for efficient harmonization.

WHY ARE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS/ROBOTS IN THE FORM FACTOR OF HUMANS?

When people hear the word robot, they conjure images of the AI robot Sofia or the robot Sonny from the
movie iRobot. However, these human form factors are some of the least desirable as they force a machine to
be subservient to a human's world instead of allowing the machine to become the solution and the path of
efficiency for humankind. Our current world is set up for humans to do the work, make the decisions, and
interact with the infrastructure. However, where we need to be is just the opposite as autonomous systems
begin to interact with our environments and other autonomous systems.

   A hybrid of a robot and a human might be the bridge between only humans working within our human-
optimized environments and when humans build more autonomous systems optimized environments, thus
ending the human-driven or human-assisted work era. As noted by Wired Magazine on March 23, 2023, "For
Smarter Robots, Just Add Humans autonomous machines are still too clumsy for delicate tasks. But humans
can operate mechanical arms from afar, turning physical labor into remote work" (Knight, 2023). Sanctuary AI
describes it as "Leveraging a blend of symbolic and neural reasoning, our autonomous control system utilizes
the best of both approaches to AI while mitigating the weaknesses of each. Put another way, it is AI like it
has never been done before" (Sanctuary AI-Creating human-like intelligence. , 2023). Figure 3-6 illustrates the
connection between robots and human intelligence, form, and senses.

                                            Figure 3-6: Creating the future

   Sanctuary AI believes that an essential job of the future will be created in the area of remotely operating
or teleoperating a physical robot Sanctuary AI "believes that this might provide a way to train robots how to
perform tasks that are currently well out of their (mechanical) reach, and imbue machines with a physical sense
of the world some argue is needed to unlock human-level artificial intelligence" (Knight, 2023).
   The next robotic evolution for Sanctuary AI is a sixth-generation, general-purpose robot (GPR) named
PhoenixTM. The company aims to "shoot for the world's first human-like intelligence in general purpose
robots. Phoenix builds on some very impressive earlier work and a neat "piloted" approach to training" (Blain,
2023). Figure 3-7 provides an image and features of the Phoenix GPR.

                                                   Figure 3-7: Phoenix

   Source: (Blain, 2023)
   Phoenix takes on a human form, although Sanctuary AI admits that the humanoid form "certainly isn't the
most efficient shape for a useful robot - but it's an excellent shape for a robot that's designed to take over as
many human tasks as possible" (Blain, 2023). This is an example of evolving robots into a human environment
instead of adapting the environment to accommodate the most efficient robotic design. The humanoid
design allows the robot to work immediately in the infrastructure that is seen today as the "modern world
is constructed mainly for bipedal creatures around a certain height, with five-fingered hands and opposable
thumbs" (Blain, 2023).

   The challenge of how to allow robots to operate more efficiently and effectively can sometimes be found in
nature, as with the "Prehistoric sea creature-like robot can navigate, surf, crawl up onto the beach. The recently
developed C-Ray uses fins to cross water, land, and ice" (Woolfolk, 2023).

                                                 Figure 3-8: Velox Robot

   Source: (Aouf, 2019)
   Taking a page from nature and allowing the robot to operate in many different environments allows the
"amphibious Velox robot to use its undulating fins to swim and crawl and Velox's versatility is due to its
undulating soft fins, which sit on either side of Velox and move in a hyperbolic pattern reminiscent of a stingray
or a millipede" (Aouf, 2019). See Figure 3-8 for a picture of the Velox robot.

THE ROBOTIC "EVOLUTION"
The robotics "evolution" is on pace to overtake the expectations of most investors and consumers. Consider
Renuka Apte, a former Dropbox and Nvidia employee turned entrepreneur. Apte founded Clockwork, a
robotics company that offers robot manicures through self-service kiosks (Clockwork Manicures in Minutes.,
2023). It is reported that Clockwork has contracts with Target and XpressSpa in dozens of airports and other
locations and plans to have stand-alone stores. Figure 3-9 shows a picture of the robotic manicure station.

                                        Figure 3-9: Robotic Manicure Station
                                                                                                       ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM] | 191

   Source: (Clockwork Manicures in Minutes., 2023)
   This gives Clockwork access to tens of thousands of customers daily. The company claims that "At just 10
minutes and $10, it's self-care that's fast and affordable" (Clockwork Manicures in Minutes., 2023).
   Clockwork creates robots that offer people the ability not to be responsible for everyday tasks. Clockwork
indicates they exist to "free people through smart automation-- changing how they work, spend their time,
and where they find peace of mind. We're utopian dreamers from around the world who believe there is no
time to waste on the mundane" (Clockwork Manicures in Minutes., 2023).
AI-THE TRAINABLE BRAIN
The human brain is still a mystery in many ways. Yet AI and other autonomous system programming profiles
192 | ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM]

attempt to use the human brain patterns to create machines that can learn, think, goal-seek, and work out
complex problems using critical thinking skills.

   Scientists are starting from the bottom and believing they are now closer to understanding consciousness in
completing the world's "first complete, high-resolution brain map of the baby fruit fly. It's the most complex
and intricate connectome of any animal's brain ever constructed and paves the way for a revolutionary new
frontier of artificial intelligence and neuroscience developments" (Thompson, 2023).

   Mapping the brain of the Drosophila Melanogaster, a type of fruit fly, took twelve years to complete.
The fruit fly shares a similar biology to that of humans. This tiny insect has 3,016 neurons with 548,000
connections..." (Thompson, 2023). Researchers have been correlating the study of insect brains to humans
into an actual trainable AI brain. It is easy to see that although AI is data-rich and offers the beginning of
complex problem-solving; it will take a significant effort in funding, research, and development to demonstrate
actual progress.

   Most people think of killer robots or the adverse actions that these machines can take based on their
trainable brains when discussing the concept of AI, machine learning, advanced robotics, or quantum
computing in the context of autonomous systems. However, advanced robots are no different from any other
technology; they can be used for good or evil or flip-flop from good and bad deeds based on the programmed
missions of their human owner.

   The healthcare industry benefits as robotics can assist the healthcare worker shortages and advance medicine
beyond the current norm. Robots would not replace all humans; they would supplement healthcare workers
as robots "could take on basic healthcare tasks to support the work of doctors and nurses may be the way of the
future" (Sensing robot healthcare helpers. , 2021).

   Woo Soo Kim, associate professor in the School of Mechatronic Systems Engineering, states, "The recent
pandemic demonstrates the need to minimize human-to-human interaction between healthcare workers and
patients... There's an opportunity for sensing robots to measure essential healthcare information on behalf of
care providers in the future" (Sensing robot healthcare helpers. , 2021).

   The development of human and machine interfaces can take many forms, such as Elon Musk's Nuerolink
(Gilbert, 2019) or in "The development of a cutting-edge graphene sensor has led to the creation of an interface
that is able to accurately control a robot using thought alone. The development has positive implications not
only for healthcare but for a range of other industries" (McClure, 2023). See Figure 3-10 for a person using a
graphene sensory device.

   Figure 3-10: Male human wearing an augmented reality visor with graphene sensors attached to
                                                  the back of the scalp

   Source: (McClure, 2023)
   The augmented reality visor, as shown in Figure 3-10, serves as a brain-machine interface. "Brain-machine
interfaces (BMIs) allow a person to operate a device using their brainwaves. As hands-free and voice-free
interfaces, BMIs hold great potential for use in robotics, bionic prosthetics, and self-driving cars" (McClure,
2023).
   Nanobots target a brain cancer known as glioblastoma as it builds on previous research at the University
of Toronto Robotics Institute. The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) research team using Midjourney
took a novel approach to a possible answer to glioblastoma. They used nanorobotic scalpel swarms to shred the
mitochondria of the cancer cells from the inside. The scalpel swarms were energized by using a magnetic field
surrounding the malignant cells "...the tubes were made to spin, wreaking havoc to the internal structure of the
cells - particularly to their mitochondria, which fundamentally provides cellular energy. The tubes acted like
thousands of mini scalpels that sliced up the cancer cells from the inside (Franco, Nano-robotic scalpel swarm
shreds brain cancer cells from the inside, 2023a).

                                Figure 3-11: Brain image highlighting the surgical area
194 | ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM]

   Source: (Franco, Nano-robotic scalpel swarm shreds brain cancer cells from the inside, 2023a)
   Although this technique is specific to help fight glioblastoma, "the new nanobot technique could also be
adjusted to work on other types of tumors...Theoretically, by changing the antibody coating and redirecting
nanotubes to the desired tumor site, we could potentially have a means to precisely destroy tumor cells in other
cancers" (Franco, Nano-robotic scalpel swarm shreds brain cancer cells from the inside, 2023a).

SECURING THE INSTRUCTIONS/QUANTUM REVOLUTION
In a 2023 article titled "An AI Was Trained to Detect Parkinson's Years Before Symptoms Appeared," David
Nield discusses how the AI "Using trained layers of nodes modeled on the human brain, the tool hunts for
specific chemical compounds (metabolites) in the blood, figuring out the patterns that can potentially predict
the presence of disease or protect against it" (Nield, 2023).

   Disease prevention is an excellent use of AI; however, what if the AI was trained to attack healthy cells or, on
command, kill the host?

   Most, if not all, robots/humanoids/autonomous systems are connected via a link to the internet, an
intranet, each other, or other systems. These autonomous systems are an extension of the Internet of Things
(IoT) as they perform a function with a base set of instructions. Sadly, as the world is discovering, IoT devices
are not being designed or built with the proper level of cyber security.

   The first open-market humanoid robot was from the Chinese tech firm Xiaomi, named CyberOne, in
August 2022. The robot has a starting cost of more than $100,000. The robot claims human-like properties
including walking and recognizing dozens of emotions "as it interacts with humans that it encounters" (Stokel-
                                                                                                       ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM] | 195

Walker, 2022). The humanoid robot is 5'9" tall and designed to be at eye level with its human counterpart.
In addition, CyberOne can "identify 85 environmental sounds, alongside the 45 human emotions that it can
discover, using its AI interaction algorithm that perceives where it is in the world in three dimensions...which
allows it to fully simulate human movements" (Stokel-Walker, 2022).

   Tesla is not far behind in launching the sale of its robot. Elon Musk, Tesla's Chief Executive Officer, has
written that the goal was "for humanoid robots to go beyond industrial work in factories and instead to make
themselves at home in the home, helping out with household tasks in a way that would be meaningful" (Stokel-
Walker, 2022). Musk continued with his vision. "It is foreseeable that with the power of robots, we will create
an era of extreme abundance of goods and services, where everyone can live a life of abundance," Musk wrote.
"Perhaps the only scarcity that will exist in the future is for us to create ourselves as humans" (Stokel-Walker,
2022).

   All of this is exciting news. However, there does not appear to be any mention of the security protocols on
board or how the AI and IoT instructions are being secured, verified, altered, or monitored. The size, shape,
and uses of autonomous systems continue to evolve, and so must the security levels in these systems. Consider
that "Autonomous mining trucks are a $1.6 billion market and currently account for approximately 2% percent
of all mining trucks, but there is a tremendous opportunity with revenue expected to increase to $12.6 billion
by 2031" (Reynolds, 2023).

                            Figure 3-12: A Caterpillar 550 autonomous mining truck

   Source: (Reynolds, 2023)
196 | ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM]

   Figure 3-12 depicts a Caterpillar 794AC mining truck equipped with CAT MineStar Command for
Hauling. More than 550 CAT autonomous mining trucks are in operation.

   The intended or unintended damage of an autonomous system of this size being hacked and given nefarious
instructions could be devastating. Mining operations around the world are expanding their use of
autonomously operated systems. An "Australian mining firm Roy Hill recently announced the expansion of
its AHS by converting its fleet of 96 conventional haul trucks to driverless operation and creating the world's
largest autonomous mine" (Reynolds, 2023).

   Governments and industries are working together to ensure safety. However, enterprises and governments
are not moving as quickly as one would think, as there is currently "no single agency in charge of this issue nor a
clear path to creating a support mechanism for future needs. Nor is there a single sensor type, defense posture,
or reliable countermeasure currently in place to stop these evolving threats" (Bishop, 2023).

   Once considered only science fiction, the shift in the world's workforce to autonomous systems is now a
reality.

   In its many forms, quantum is an example of forward progress, without adequately recognizing the need
for security before marketing a product. The "emergence of potential quantum supremacy has been predicted
by 2035. This prediction has caused excitement and an inflection point for the quantum information science
ecosystem. Quantum supremacy will require a strategic shift in the workforce to meet this new cross-domain
capability" (Bishop, 2023).

   Currently, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is investigating self-healing systems
through a committee known as Cyber Security for Next Generation Connectivity Systems, including
developing a standard for fault-tolerant systems to the point of self-healing.

   This concept is further discussed in a 2023 article in the Quantum Literacy magazine "Self-Healing Systems
is a field of study that finds methods and ways on how a system, service, or product can adjust and self-heal
based on various types of triggers or criteria" (Bishop et al., 2023).

   This discussion is critical as "building self-healing systems will require the ability to continuously measure
systems, services, or products at a sub-component level, all the while adjusting the security configurations based
on observed triggers or criteria" (Bishop et al., 2023).

   This line of inquiry has a goal to "explore how a system, service, or product could be dynamically protected
(in a self-healing manner) based on those observed criteria" (Bishop et al., 2023).

   Two researchers have shown how a Tesla -- and other cars -- can be hacked remotely without user
interaction. A drone conducted the attack on the Tesla car (Kovacs, 2021).

   The attack, dubbed TBONE, exploits "two vulnerabilities affecting ConnMan, an internet connection
manager for embedded devices. A hacker who exploits the vulnerabilities can perform any task that a regular
user could from the infotainment system...opening doors, changing seat positions, playing music, controlling
the air conditioning, and modifying steering and acceleration modes" (Kovacs, 2021).

   To secure the data in advanced computing systems that are required to allow autonomous systems to
                                                                                                       ARTIFICIAL BRAINS AND BODY [MUMM] | 197

operate, manufacturers must start by linking quantum security with the ability "to explore emerging concepts
of cyber and supply chain trust models while creating hybrid computing security controls models will enable
a digital forensic investigation (DFI) of an alleged supply chain cybersecurity breach to be documented and
properly investigated" (Bishop et al., 2023).

CONCLUSIONS

There are many different form factors for robots and autonomous systems. Robots built to operate in the
human world give little thought as to how to optimize the world around the robot to allow it to perform its
mission more efficiently. Robots are being built to look like humans, take on human emotions, and learn and
interact in a world that has been optimized for human beings and even animals, although not autonomous
systems.

   The critical thinking, learning, and decision engines that are being built into autonomous systems are made
by humans; thus, they will have flaws, unintended uses, and consequences. The systems' brains will remain
binary all the way. Yet, humans still struggle to understand how a human brain functions, learns best, retains,
and retrieves data. This data movement is influenced by emotions driving the body and mind, not in a binary
energy exchange. The security required to allow autonomous systems to flourish with minimal risk of hacking
and harm to the human and environment around the designs is not in place and, at present, does not appear
to be a priority to manufacturers, governing bodies, or governments. The lack of security controls should raise
alarms to those conducting research and development, integrators, and the end user.

QUESTIONS

 1. Do you think the robotic evolution will see a day when humans no longer work a full-time job or have
      multiple careers in their lifetime?

 2. List three disruptive technologies that have altered the form factor of human systems.

 3. How would you design the form factor of a robotic system to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
      Consider you might need to change the entire supply chain to take advantage of robotic efficiencies.

 4. Can a shape-shifting robot be used for good and evil purposes? Please give two examples.

 5. In the current cyber security arena, do you think an AI or quantum-driven humanoid can be secured to
      only run/operate on its given instructions and simplistic critical thinking skills? What level of cyber
      security do you think is acceptable?

AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE]

LEARNING OUTCOMES

   AI in the Agricultural (Ag) and food industries comprise a number of technologies, from robotics to
machine learning. By "AI" we are simply referring to machinery and technologies used to conduct complex
tasks that previously required human thought to complete. Our purposes:

  · To explore artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the world of agriculture, food
      production and global food supply.

  · To investigate AI related technologies from space operations to earth manufacturing with the goal of
      feeding the world population more efficiently.

  · To recognize the US will continue to be vulnerable to deliberate introductions of exotic plant and
      animal diseases by terrorist groups and to identify effects.

INTRODUCTION

In 2023, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the subject of thousands of articles and books. Artificial intelligence is
defined as: "1. a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers,
and 2: the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior." (Definition of Artificial Intelligence
, 2023). Chapter 4 is devoted / limited to continuing our humanitarian goal of using technologies to improve
the lives of the global population. In our previous textbook, Space Systems: Emerging Technologies and
Operations(Nichols R. K., et al., 2022), Section III included three chapters on the subject. Chapter 10 covered
Drones and Precision Agricultural Mapping. (Mumm, 2022) Chapter 11 covered Civilian use of Space for
Environmental, Wildlife Tracking, & Fire Risk Zone ID. (Ryan, 2022) Chapter 12 addressed the
Humanitarian Use of Space Technologies to Improve Global Food Supply & Cattle Management. (Larson,
2022)

   "SECTION 3 is our Hope for Humanity and Positive Global Change. Just think if the technologies we
202 | AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE]

discuss, when put into responsible hands, could increase food production by 1-2%. How many more millions
of families could have food on their tables?" (Nichols R. K., et al., 2022)[1]

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND AGRICULTURE: HOW INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGIES
CAN HELP FEED THE WORLD

AI has significant potential to improve the agricultural industry and help feed the worlds growing population.
Through applications like precision agriculture, livestock monitoring, supply chain optimization, and labor
optimization, AI can provide farmers with essential information and insights to make better decisions about
productivity. (Zheng, 2023)

   However, there are challenges that must be addressed in the adoption of AI (and ML) in Agriculture
(Ag) such as: data availability and quality, integration with legacy systems, and cost. Ethical considerations of
transparency, accountability, fairness, and privacy must be integrated into the AI systems implemented.

   There is also the threat of using AI to implement Bioweapons in the Ag sphere and necessity of risk
assessments to reduce vulnerabilities from these threats and to apply appropriate countermeasures. (Nichols &
Carter, 2022) (Nichols R. K., et al., 2022)

TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

AI dates back to the 1950's with rule-based systems. In recent years, sophisticated AI algorithms capable of
complex decision-making and problem-solving tasks have been built. AI takes many forms:

   Rule-based AI: aka expert systems, uses pre-programmed data and rules and relies on "if-then" statements
and logical rules to make decisions.

   ML: a form of AI that involves developing algorithms that can learn from data and improve performance
over time.

   Deep Learning: ML subset that focuses on neural networks with many layers of processing. They are used
to analyze "big data," or large amounts of data, image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language
processing.

   Reinforcement Learning: see definition below.
   Natural Language Processing (NLP): is a type of AI involving analyzing and generating human language.
NLP is used in chatbots, voice assistants, and language translations.
   Reactive Machines: Only respond to specific stimuli and do not learn or predict outcomes
   Limited Memory: Limited to specific data sets are able to learn to improve performance
   Self-Aware: Theoretical and would possess human-like consciousness and emotions.[2] (Zheng, 2023)

   Similarly, there are growth in the machine learning (ML) techniques:
                                        AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE] | 203

   Supervised Learning: Training an AI system with labeled data sets and allowing it to make predictions,
   Unsupervised Learning: Training an AI system on unlabeled data sets and enabling them to identify patterns
and relationships without guidance,
   Reinforcement Learning: Training an AI system through trial and error, rewarding it for correct decisions
and punishing it for incorrect ones. (Zheng, 2023)

AG LANDSCAPE

   The global landscape of agriculture is diverse and complex with different regions and countries facing
unique challenges and opportunities. (Zheng, 2023) identifies key global trends in the Ag and food
production.

   Growing population and food demand: Global population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, leading
to a significant increase in global food demand. (Zheng, 2023)

   Climate change and environmental pressures: Climate change and environmental pressures pose significant
challenges for agricultural production. More frequent and severe weather events such as droughts and floods
can affect crop yields and increase production costs. "The agriculture industry needs to adopt sustainable
practices to minimize its environmental footprint." (Zheng, 2023)[3] See (Wrightstone, 2017) and (R. K.
Nichols, 2021)also for different perspectives.

   Technical advancements in Ag: we have come a long way from simple tools and plows to advanced
machinery like tractors and combines. Now AI offers the next generational step to improve efficiency,
productivity, and sustainability in Ag. (Zheng, 2023)

   Changes in Crops and Livestock production: Resources, cultural practices, cultivation readiness affect the
high-value crops such as rice, wheat, fruits, and vegetables all may change with the AI use. Similarly, livestock
production including dairy, meat, and poultry will be directly affected by AI. (Zheng, 2023) Land ownership
will change, and this has an indirect affect on the introduction if AI technologies. [4]

   Supply chain and distribution: Ag supply chains comprise a network of producers, processors, distributors,
wholesalers, and retailers who collectively ensure that food reaches consumers. Logistics and distribution play
a critical role in maintaining the quality and safety of food products during transportation. (Zheng, 2023)

   Policy and Regulation: policies, regulations, environmental practices, food safety inspections, labor
standards can vary significantly from country to country and may have significant implications for the
industry's sustainability and profitability. (Zheng, 2023)

SURVEYING THE POTENTIAL OF AI IN AGRICULTURE

A good place to start is a review of Louis Columbus' Forbes article on the 10 Ways AI Has The Potential To
204 | AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE]

Improve Agriculture In 2021. [5] (Columbus, 2021) We follow this review with a report on Dr. MingHai
Zheng's 2023 book entitled Artificial Intelligence and Agriculture: How Intelligent Technologies Can Help Feed
the World. Dr. Zheng explores the current state-of-the-art intersection of AI and agriculture, focusing on how
intelligent technologies can be used to improve farming practices and increase productivity. Dr Zheng's goal is
to identify opportunities for future research and development. Along with Hope comes Evil. Our survey will
include selected directions from our own research chaired by international SME Dr. Suzanne M. Sincavage in
her Chapter 8. Bio-threats to Agriculture-Solutions from Space. (S. Sincavage, 2022)

AI POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE AGRICULTURE

The driving force is money. According to BI Intelligence Research, global spending on smart, connected
agricultural technologies and systems, including AI and machine learning (ML) is projected to triple in
revenue by 2025 to $15.3 billion. (Top 5 2023 Agriculture Trends to Watch, 2023). (Columbus, 2021)
Spending on AI solutions for agriculture is predicted to grow at a whopping CAGR[6] of 25.5% to $4 billion
in 2026. (Columbus, 2021) 87% of U.S. agricultural businesses use AI. (87-of-us-agriculture-businesses-are-
currently-using-ai, 2021) According to Allied Market Research, IoT enabled agricultural (IoTAg) monitoring
is the fastest connected growing technology segment projected to reach $84.5 billion by 2031 growing at
CAGR of 12.6%. (Allied Market Research, 2023) How valid these estimates are only time will tell, however, we
conclude there is considerable financial interest in AI/ ML and real-time sensor data to apply to agricultural
applications, such as precision farming, livestock monitoring, [7] smart greenhouses, and fish farm monitoring.

   AI, machine learning (ML) and the IoT sensors that provide real-time data for algorithms increase
agricultural efficiencies, improve crop yields, and reduce food production costs. (Columbus, 2021)Of special
interest is IoT- enabled sensors and devices that allow farmers to remotely monitor soil moisture, temperature,
and other conditions to optimize crop yields and reduce water usage. (Allied Market Research, 2023)

   Linking farms through a single platform and sharing intelligence gained is another method to improving
productivity and reducing waste. Allied Market Research, 2023)

   IoT boosts agricultural output. Real time field data collection, storage, analysis, and control platforms
improve operational efficiency and increase crop yields. Excellent data portends the success of crop cycles.
(Columbus, 2021) Think of the many processes that farmers must track weather, seasonal sunlight, migratory
patterns of animals, birds, insects, deer,[8] use of specialized fertilizers, insecticides by crop, planting cycles
and irrigation cycles all affect yield. These are perfect for AI and ML solutions. Data-centric approaches work.
(Columbus, 2021)

SURVEILLANCE

Using AI and ML- based surveillance systems to monitor every crop field's real-time video feeds identifies
                                        AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE] | 205

animal or human breaches, sending an alarm or alert immediately can be remarkably effective, annoying [9]
and provide evidence, if necessary, in a police call. On the positive side, AI / ML reduce domestic and wild
animals potential to accidentally destroy crops or experience a break-in or burglary at a remote farm location.
Farm perimeter security can be augmented. AI /ML solutions are scalable. (Columbus, 2021)

CROP YIELD PREDICTION

Crop yield predictions are improved through real-time AI/ML sensor data and visual analytics data from
drones. (Larson, 2022) Drones provide real-time streaming on large acreage via "Earth Traces." These make
it possible to combine in-ground sensor data on moisture, fertilizer, and natural nutrient levels plus water
/ irrigation availability to analyze growth patterns of each crop over time. (Nichols R. K., et al., 2022)
(Columbus, 2021) Understanding yield rates and quality levels of crops help agricultural firms, co-ops and
farmers better negotiate for the best possible price for their harvests. (Columbus, 2021)

YIELD MAPPING

"Yield mapping is an agricultural technique that relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to find
patterns in large-scale data sets and understand the orthogonality of them in real-time - all of which is
invaluable for crop planning." (Columbus, 2021) Potential yield rates of a given crop field can be estimated
before a vegetation cycle is started. Some of the techniques deployed are ML, 3-Dmapping, social condition
data from IoT sensors and drone-based data on soil-color. (Ryan, 2022) (Columbus, 2021) (See Figure 4-1
example Integration.)

                             Figure 4-1 Integrate UAV Technology with Yield Maps

DRONES AND PESTS
The UN, international agencies, and large-scale agricultural operations (and Kansas State University)[10]
are pioneering drone data combined with in-ground sensors (and weather stations) [11]to improve pest
management. (Mumm, 2022) Drones using IR camera data combined with sensors on fields and weather
data, which monitor plants' health, permit prediction and identification of pest infestations. (Mumm,
2022) (Columbus, 2021) (Figure 4-2)

       Figure 4-2 (a) State-of-the-art open-loop remote sensing paradigm and (b) closed-loop IPM
  paradigm envisioned in this article. Sensing drones could be used for detection of pest hotspots,

               while actuation drones could be used for precision distribution of solutions.

   Source: Adapted from (Teske A. L., 2019)
   Both (Mumm, 2022) and (Columbus, 2021) point out that AI/ML optimization biodegradable pesticides
to only the field areas that need treatment, reduces costs, and increases yields. By using intelligent sensors
combined with visual data streams from drones, agricultural AI applications can now detect a planting area's
most infected areas. Using supervised machine learning algorithms, they can then define the optimal mix of
pesticides to reduce pests' threat spreading further and infecting healthy crops.
FARM EMPLOYEE TROUBLE? AI TO RESCUE
In 2023, there's a shortage of agricultural workers, making AI and machine learning-based smart tractors,
agribots and robotics a viable option for many remote agricultural operations. Large farming operations turn
to robotics for hundreds of acres of crops while also providing an element of security around the perimeter of
remote locations. Programming self-propelled robotics machinery to distribute fertilizer on each row of crops
helps keep operating costs down and improve field yields. (Columbus, 2021)
208 | AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE]

TRACK AND TRACEABILITY (T&T)

Improving the track-and-traceability of agricultural supply chains by removing roadblocks to get fresher, safer
crops to market is a must-have Tin 2023. A well-managed T&T system helps reduce inventory shrinkage by
providing greater visibility and control across supply chains. A state-of-the-art T&T system can differentiate
between inbound shipments' batch, lot, and container level assignments of materials. T&T systems rely on
advanced sensors to gain greater knowledge of each shipment's condition. RFID and IoT sensors are now
becoming more commonplace across manufacturing. (Columbus, 2021)

WATER

AI/ML optimizing irrigation systems and measuring how effective frequent crop irrigation improves yield
rates are all areas AI contributes to improving farming efficiencies. Water is the scarcest resource in many
parts of North America, especially in communities that rely most on agriculture as their core business. Being
efficient in using it can mean the difference between a farm or agricultural operation staying profitable or not.
(Columbus, 2021) (Larson, 2022) (Mumm, 2022) (Ryan, 2022)

LIVESTOCK

(Larson, 2022) discusses monitoring cattle health and food intake. Dr Larson validates (Columbus, 2021)
conclusions about livestock in his Forbes article. "Monitoring livestock's health, including vital signs, daily
activity levels and food intake, ensures their health is one of the fastest-growing aspects of AI and machine
learning in agriculture. Understanding how every type of livestock reacts to diet and boarding conditions is
invaluable in understanding how they can be best treated for the long term. Using AI and machine learning to
understand what keeps daily cows content and happy, producing more milk is essential. For many farms who
rely on cows and livestock, this area opens up entirely new insights into how farms can be more profitable."
(Columbus, 2021)

ROBOTS AND AI

According to research by the University of Sydney, Ag-robots have the potential to mitigate food security
issues.[12] (University of Sydney, 2022) Ending global hunger has long been a critical goal for the global
community. When the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals were released in 2014, ending hunger,
food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition formed SDG2. (University of Sydney, 2022)

   "Though there has been some progress in the fight against hunger - ongoing conflicts, economic downturns
and the COVID-19 pandemic have been major barriers to achieving SDG2. As of 2020, according to the UN,
                                        AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE] | 209

720 and 811 million people globally faced hunger, and current estimates suggest that 660 million people may
still face hunger in 2030." (University of Sydney, 2022)

   Professor Salah Sukkarieh, a robotics engineer at the University of Sydney's Australian Centre for Field
Robotics, and his team have developed Digital Farmhand, a small, autonomous, electric tractor-like vehicle
can assist smallholder farmers to improve their productivity and yields.

   "Our Digital Farmhand robot is designed to assist smallholder farmers to improve their productivity and
yields and provide a more reliable income amidst changing markets and climates. In its simplest form the
Digital Farmhand is a small, autonomous electric tractor-like vehicle that can tow a variety of implements
such as seeders, weeders, and bed preparation tools, and can undertake precision automation of many labor-
intensive farm tasks, like weeding, spraying, and seeding." (University of Sydney, 2017)

   "Digital Farmhand can also use accessible smartphone technologies along with AI to provide crop analytics
such as yield estimation or pest and disease identification." (University of Sydney, 2022) Professor Sukkarieh's
team is developing open-source artificial intelligence packages for smartphones which can be easily accessed in
the APAC. (University of Sydney, 2017) [13]

5 WAYS AI IMPROVES FOOD MANUFACTURING

Aptean is a large food service technology organization. Aptean presents 5 ways that they predict that AI will
change food manufacturing for the better.

 1. Developing New Recipes Guided By Consumer Trends

According to Aptean's VP John Payne, "all food manufacturers know that they must constantly be on the
lookout for new ways to refresh their product lines in order to stay relevant and tap into new sources of
revenue. Whereas this has traditionally taken the form of surveys and adapting to emerging trends, AI offers
companies the opportunity to predict their customers' preferences.

   By analyzing huge amounts of data around sales patterns and flavor preferences for each demographic group,
manufacturers are now able to model future trends and develop new products to capitalize on them quicker.
AI is also being used to allow consumers a greater degree of personalization in the products they buy. This
breakthrough doesn't just identify what the most popular flavor combinations are likely to be, it makes the
product development process shorter and less expensive, helping companies get their new products to market
faster and with less trial and error." (Payne, 2021)

 2. Supply Chain Management

Being able to manage supply chains effectively is one of the top priorities for food manufacturers. Companies
at the cutting edge are now utilizing algorithms based on artificial neural networks to monitor shipments at
every stage of the supply chain, improving food safety standards and enabling full transparency. AI in the food
industry is also capable of creating accurate forecasts to manage inventory and pricing. This kind of predictive
analysis helps keep food businesses one step ahead, enabling them to avoid wastage and unnecessary costs, said
Mr. Payne. (Payne, 2021)

 3. A More Efficient Cleaning Process

All equipment and machinery involved in food production needs to be cleaned to the most rigorous standards.
This isn't just to avoid contamination of food with pathogens, but to prevent allergen cross-contamination.
Unfortunately, this comes at a cost--in terms of both time and money. Innovative AI technology is beginning
to change this. Developed by the University of Nottingham, a Self-Optimizing-Clean-In-Place (SOCIP)
system uses optical fluorescence imaging and ultrasonic sensing to scan the food remains left in machinery
after use. (University of Nottingham SOCIP, 2016) [See Figure 4-4] This allows for a more optimized cleaning
process, where the amount of water needed is cut by 20-40% and the cleaning time is reduced by 50%, because
equipment no longer needs to be disassembled. (Payne, 2021)
                                         AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE] | 211

 4. More Hygienic Production Lines
Food safety breaches can be unbelievably costly for food manufacturers. Both in terms of fines and the
reputational damage associated with poor health and safety. AI in food manufacturing is reducing the risk of
such breaches in a number of ways. The more parts of the food production process that can be dealt with by
robots, the less likely products are to become contaminated with pathogens. Robots can be made completely
sterile. AI can be used to increase the cleanliness of a manufacturer's human workforce. Facial and object-
recognition technologies are being used to track whether hygiene protocols are being followed. (Payne, 2021)

 5. Food Sorting
Food sorting is a laborious and time-consuming process that slows the production line and requires the
employment of many staff members. This is especially true when it comes to the sorting of fresh produce
items--with human sorters responsible for removing all units that aren't at the standard required for sale. The
amount of time and the number of people required to complete this crucial activity can be reduced with the
assistance of AI. Cameras and lasers are used to assess the shape, color, and structural integrity of every item,
automatically identifying ones which need to be filtered out. (Payne, 2021)

WIZATA

WIZATA in Luxembourg adds a key element to Payne's list. Along with Sorting Food, Improving Cleaning
Processing, Supply Chain Management and Growing Better Food, they add emphasis to Food Safety
Compliance. (WIZATA, 2023) Safety is the top priority for all food processing businesses. All employees and
workers who come in direct touch with food have to wear a proper costume and comply with safety standards.
Tracking hundreds of employees and making sure that everyone follows the rules is easier said than done. AI-
enabled cameras can monitor all workers and notify managers in case a rule is broken. The AI can quickly
identify safety issues such as not wearing proper food protection gear or not complying with the rules. The
AI can monitor production in real-time and send warnings directly to workers or their managers. (WIZATA,
2023)

AI AND RESTURANTS

Escoffier.edu teaches courses in restaurant management. Part of their culinary, pastry and courses for restaurant
discipline presents students with a seminar in how AI is changing restaurants. Here are the 9 ways that AI is
improving restaurant efficiency:

 1. Personalized menu recommendations for guests
 2. Permitting management to make predictive analytics for smarter forecasting
 3. Chatbots to answer questions, take orders, and set reservations
 4. Improved cost tracking and menu pricing
 5. AI-integrated inventory & purchasing to save time
 6. Robotic food delivery
 7. More efficient food production
 8. Developing a stronger and safer supply chain
 9. Predicting Consumer Response to new products. (escoffier.edu, 2023)

INDIA AND ETHIOPIA

In an extensive Indian and Ethiopian joint university research project lead by Dr. Indrajeet Kumar, AI and ML
were reviewed in Opportunities of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Food Industry. (Kumar,
Rawat, Mohd, & Husain, 2021)[14][15]

   Their findings for AI and ML in the food industry are consistent with all the OSI addressed factors
identified/discussed elsewhere in this chapter. See Figures 4-5, 4-6, 4-7, 4-8, and 4-9 for image summaries of
Dr. Kumar's team findings.

  · Robotics

   Figure 4-9 shows two key AI uses in food safety:

  · NGS and electric noses [16]
  · Food waste management

NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING AND ELECTRIC NOSES

   The two most promising inventions in the food industry are next-generation sequencing (NGS) and electric
noses (ENs). NGS is replacing the DNA approach in the food security region very quickly. The introduction
of AI-based automated systems and workflows helped formulate data acquisition and laboratory trials much
quicker and more accurately. NGS can find hazardous inclination very quickly and efficiently. It can also
prevent the infection epidemics before the impairment of an ample amount of people. ENs are the surrogate
for a person muzzle in fabrication surroundings. Some sensors are placed that can precisely identify a diversity
of smells. These sensors just sense the smell around the surroundings, and sensed data are transferred to a
data center where ML algorithms access these data (Fedorova, Darbasov, & Okhlopkov, 2020) (Yu, Lin, &
Wu, 2020). According to the decision made by the ML-based system, an alarm signal is transferred to the

manufacturing units. EN can be the upcoming future of food products safety. (Kumar, Rawat, Mohd, &
Husain, 2021) However, they did present clarifications of interest on smart farming (SF) technologies.

   AI in SF has some important applications such as soil monitoring, robot cropping, and predictive analysis.

SOIL MONITORING (SM)
Under the AI-based system, computer vision and deep-learning algorithm is particularly important and used to
investigate the sequence of information or data received by the AI-based agents to trace the progress of crop and
soil health. Computerized systems are used to make available clients with a sagacity[17] of their soil's strengths
and weaknesses. The prime objective behind the building of the developed system is to identify defective crops
and identify the probable approach for healthy crop development. (Kumar, Rawat, Mohd, & Husain, 2021)

   Companies are taking advantage of agriculture AI and aerial technology (Drones / UAS) to keep an eye
on crop health. The company's primary reason is to decrease the costs and improve crop growth. Users
preprogram the drone's route and then integrate with the device. After that, the computer vision will record
some pictures that will be used for examination purposes. (Kumar, Rawat, Mohd, & Husain, 2021)

   IoT plays an important role in decision on crop and soil monitoring (Raut, Varma, Mulla, & Pawar, 2018).
SM with IoT is the application of AI that supports farmers and food industries to capitalize on their economy,

diminish the chances of ailment, and optimize uses of available assets. In these, sensors are deployed to sense
the temperature of the soil, amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) in soil, moisture level, the
content of water, potential in soil, amount of photosynthetic radiation, and oxygen level in soil (Bhattacharyya,
Sarkar, Sarkar, Sinha, & Chanda, 2020). Collected data from the various sensors [Table 4-1]are forwarded to
the cloud for action. The outcome of the analysis, visualization of received data, is helpful in resource use.
The identification of the behavior of the system requires identifying the trends of soil and making the decisions
to maximum crop yield and excellent products. (Raut, Varma, Mulla, & Pawar, 2018) (Bhattacharyya, Sarkar,
Sarkar, Sinha, & Chanda, 2020). Agriculture based IoT is called smart agriculture. IoT-based food industry is
called the smart food industry. (Kumar, Rawat, Mohd, & Husain, 2021)

ROBOCROP

Robocrop is an AI-based robotic system that advances the yielding process by maximizing usefulness and
uniformity. It conducts line up crop tools accurately and at a high rate. The food industry product shrubbery
forward of the system is monitored by a high-resolution and precise system. The captured image is processed
by a high-performing workstation to attend the maximum attentiveness of green band pixels relating to the
crop line. Due to the outsized region captured by the input devices and the numerous processing line, an
outstanding typical crop Center-line tracking is accomplished (Machleb, Peteinatos, Kollenda, And´ujar, &
Gerhards, 2020). It evaluates the resultant image to a ground truth gridiron pattern with the crop line area.
The obtained information is then employed to align the instruments in the row via a hydraulic-based shift.
The pattern-based attribute builds the system healthy besides backdrop pick over infestations. It improves the
performance and production rate just because of multicameras and multiple sensors. (Kumar, Rawat, Mohd,
& Husain, 2021) See example in Figure 4-10.

   Dr. Kumar describes several advanced Robocrop systems, including dual arm systems for fruit harvesting;
robotic weeding systems; robot image systems for identifying plant growth; and adaptive robot chassis (ARC)
for sorting strawberry flowers. (Kumar, Rawat, Mohd, & Husain, 2021)

                                         Figure 4-10 Robocrop picking crops
220 | AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE]

   Source: Adapted from Figure 3, p4 in(Kumar, Rawat, Mohd, & Husain, 2021)
   "The performance of the Robocrop completely depends on input image features. If the input image
contains more dominant features, then it shows outstanding results. In every sample of an input image, the
crop must present more shrubbery than the wildflower and the crop shrubbery should be near to the mean
of the RGB color band. A typical Robocrop system consists of a Robocrop console part, a hydraulic-based
shaft, a three-point linkage frame, a high-definition camera, various types of speed sensors, an ADC adapter,
and infrastructure." (Machleb, Peteinatos, Kollenda, And´ujar, & Gerhards, 2020) See Figure 4-10.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS
Learning models are developed to trail and forecast various environmental effects on crop yield such as weather
changes. For this, ML algorithms account for a significant role. ML algorithms in association with the satellites
investigate crop sustainability, predict the weather, and assess farms to know about the existence of pests and
diseases. ML models are exceptionally good at delivering high standard data or information that is perpetually
updated at a quick rate. The data sources such as precipitation, wind speed, solar radiation, and temperature
along with historical values are important for predictive analysis. The obtained analysis accounts for an
important role for adequate scheduling and crop selection for particular agricultural land (Imran, Ahmad, &
Kim, 2020).

INTELLIGENT AI AND AGRICULTURE INTERSECTION
In Section III of (Nichols R. K., et al., 2022) our Hope was to improve the global food supply by as much
as 1-2%.[18] Dr Zheng in his book (Zheng, 2023) focuses on five areas of research and presents case studies.
These are:

 1. AI - and its role in agriculture and its potential to feed the world,
      2. Agriculture Technology,
      3. Intelligent Technologies,
      4. Food Security, and
      5. Sustainability.
222 | AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE]

Agriculture is a critical industry that plays a vital role in ensuring food security and sustainability. The
agriculture sector faces numerous challenges such as climate change, limited resources, and growing demand
for food. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to address these challenges by providing
intelligent solutions to optimize agricultural practices. (Zheng, 2023)

   Dr Zheng states that "machine learning techniques have numerous applications in agriculture,
including:" (Zheng, 2023)

   Crop-yield prediction: ML algorithms can analyze historical weather data, soil moisture levels and content,
to predict crop yields and optimize inputs.

   Pest Management: ML can be used to develop predicative models for pest outbreaks, enabling farmers to
take preventive measures before damage occurs.

   Soil Analysis: ML algorithms analyze the soil samples, identify nutrient deficiencies, and recommend
fertilization strategies.

   Livestock Monitoring: ML algorithms can monitor animal behavior and health data, allowing farmers to
detect early signs of disease or distress. ML is also used in monitoring global migration patterns.

BIO-THREATS TO AGRICULTURE FROM SPACE [19]

For every good there is an opposing evil. The first sections addressed the good side of IA technology to improve
crop yields and to endure the Hope of our team to feed the global population. But there is evil too in the form
of Bio-Threats to the planet's agricultural resources. These must be addressed and the threats they provide
must be countered.

   Publicly available scientific literature about Agroterrorism, biological crimes, and biological warfare
targeting livestock and poultry dates back over 100 years. Copious research reports, peer reviews, books, and
studies characterizing bioterrorism risks, threats, impact, and detection methods for/to plant ecosystems and
the US economy. They have been published as OSI. (Nichols R. K., et al., 2022) (Nichols, et al., 2021)
Similarly, research reports, papers, and special government studies have been completed detailing effective
plant-advanced bioterrorism countermeasures. These are CLASSIFIED and not OSI.

   Bio-threats to agricultural resources are commonly natural. However, rival governments, terrorists, and
rogue actors can target critical agricultural infrastructure. The deliberate introduction of an animal or plant
disease to generate fear, cause economic losses, and/or undermine stability is known as Agroterrorism,[20] a subset
of bioterrorism. [21] (O.S. Cupp, 2004)

   Terrorist groups may be motivated to attack plants, animals, or agricultural products to attract attention
to a cause, incite fear, disrupt society, or demonstrate a capability to exact political concessions. Others may
be prompted by motives such as economic interest, sabotage, or revenge (Ban, 2000). In the event of an
agroterrorism attack, keeping the biological incursion from inflicting significant damage to human health and
the economy will depend heavily on quick alerts for farmers and disease specialists. We have seen (supra) that
these can be addressed using AI and sensors.
                                         AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE] | 223

   Currently, satellite and sensor technologies are revolutionizing crop and livestock disease detection. These
technologies can be used individually or in combination to support agricultural surveillance and
communication to assist and mitigate threats on the ground. Satellite imaging detects the distinct
environmental conditions that may serve as a refuge for the disease-carrying animals. Electromagnetic spectra
also provide useful information to make decisions regarding plant physiological stress. In a captured image,
plant disease is identified by observing the physiological disturbances caused by foliar reflectance in a near-
infrared portion of the spectrum. (S. Sincavage, 2022)

DISEASES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTIVITY

The burden of agriculture on endemic and naturally imported epidemic diseases is high. It confirms the
capacity of animal and plant diseases to cause economic harm. The United States is free of many significant
global livestock diseases because of effective surveillance of herds and imports and aggressive eradication
campaigns. (Howard, 2013) In general, losses from animal disease account for 17% of the production costs of
animal products in the developed world and twice that amount in the developing world.

   The cost of crop diseases to the US economy has been estimated to be more than $30 billion / year. The
costs include reducing quantity (bushels/acre) and quality (blemished fruit, toxins in grain) yield, short-term
control costs, pesticides, and long-term management and harvesting. (Howard, 2013)

WHAT ARE THE AGRICULTURE, LIVESTOCK, AND COMPANION ANIMAL WEAPONS?

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
and the Center for Food Security and Public Health (CFSPH) have developed some serious charts about
Agriculture and Zoonotic Bioterrorism. Figures 4-11 to 4-18 portray the threats that must be considered in
every risk assessment to develop detection, mitigation, and recovery countermeasures. (Nichols, et al., 2021) (S.
Sincavage, 2022)

POTENTIAL TARGETS OF AGRICULTURAL BIOTERRORISM

There are five potential targets of agricultural bioterrorism: field crops; farm animals; food items in the
processing or distribution chain; market-ready foods at the wholesale or retail level; and agricultural facilities,
including processing plants, storage facilities, wholesale and retail food outlets, elements of the transportation
infrastructure, and research laboratories. (Nichols & Carter, 2022) (Parker, 2002) (Wilson, 2000) (Bipartisan
Committee on Biodefense, 2022) (Carus, 2015) (S. Sincavage, 2022)
224 | AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE]

   Developing a consensus for a list of the major bioterrorist threats and action items is the priority in
protecting crops and animals. Such a list is necessary to guide the development of surveillance plans, diagnostic
tests, and response plans for best containing and eradicating an introduced pathogen. Here is one from the
Bipartisan Committee on Biodefense: (Bipartisan Committee on Biodefense, 2022)

    direct losses of agriculture commodities to diseases
    costs of diagnosis and surveillance
    required the destruction of contaminated crops and animals to contain the disease
    costs of disposal of mortalities and carcasses
    damage to consumer and public confidence
    need for long-term quarantine of infected areas
    losses due to export and trade restrictions
    disruption of commodity markets.

CONTAINMENT, ERADICATION & CONTROL

Introducing exotic pathogens that cause highly contagious animal or plant diseases may elicit rapid and
aggressive attempts to contain and eradicate them. These measures cause more economic damage in the short
term than the disease itself. Cost may not be the primary factor if the infectious disease becomes endemic.
(Howard, 2013)

   Containment and eradication of exotic animal diseases are commonly done by culling the potentially
exposed animal to break the chain of transmission. (N.M. Ferguson, 2001) Many animal diseases (potential
bioterrorist threats) are caused by viruses, for which there are limited therapies once the animal is infected.
Fungi cause about 75% of plant diseases. These can be controlled with varying degrees of effectiveness by
applying fungicides. (Strange, 1993)

   Transmission of bacterial and viral crop diseases is difficult to control with chemical pesticides unless
insect vectors transmit the diseases. (Madden & et.al., 2000) Because of these difficulties, containment and
eradication of bacteriological pathogens depend heavily on quarantining infected areas and removing infected
and exposed plants. (Howard, 2013)

AGRICULTURAL BIOTERRORIST ATTACK REQUIRES RELATIVELY LITTLE EXPERTISE
OR TECHNOLOGY

One of the reasons that a bioterrorist attack on human populations is difficult is that the development of an
effective bioweapon is a technically daunting task. Many bioagents are poorly transmitted to humans requiring
                                         AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE] | 225

large amounts to be disseminated to cause mass casualties. The only way to cause mass damage is to use a
respirable aerosol. This is also a danger to the perpetrators. (Howard, 2013) (Nichols & Carter, 2022) (S.
Sincavage, 2022)

   The same difficulties do not exist for many of the diseases that would affect agricultural bioterrorist
weapons. These diseases of animals and crops are highly contagious and spread effectively from the point
source. Moreover, humans can safely manage the causative organisms without risk of infection. There is no
need for vaccination, special precautions, or prophylactic antibiotic use. (Howard, 2013) (Nichols & Carter,
2022) (S. Sincavage, 2022)

   Material to initiate the plant or animal disease outbreak can be produced in small quantities - a few
milligrams could be sufficient to initiate multiple outbreaks in widely separated locations. The raw materials
can easily be smuggled into the US. They do not even need to be created in a laboratory. (Howard, 2013)

   Dissemination requires little experience. Animal virus preparations can be diluted and disseminated with
a simple atomizer in close proximity to the animals. Simply exposing a mass of sporulating fungi in the
air immediately upward of a target field could be effective for plant diseases. Weather is the only fly in the
ointment. One nightmare scenario is the introduction of a pathogen without perpetrators entering the US.
Sorghum is planted on both sides of the Southern border, and wheat and barley are along the Canadian - US
border. Multiplication of pathogens in the foreign acreage could lead to numbers of spores blowing across the
US border and initiating the escalating outbreak. An advantage to the terrorists is that disease surveillance and
control programs are less effective/rigorous OCONUS. (Howard, 2013)

MONITORING OF PLANT PATHOGENS
What is needed?

   Answer: A real-time monitoring and communication of abnormalities within livestock and crops
using satellite technology. Figure 4-19 shows the operating and planned NASA Earth Fleet through 2023.
The Landsat series is particularly useful for agricultural bioterrorism studies. (NASA, 2021)

   Source: (NASA, 2021)
   Figure 4-20 shows the agriculture density map where satellites must penetrate with MASINT
[22]sensors. (NASA, 2021)
MASINT
Broadband and multispectral methods rely primarily on visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance
indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Ability to offer passive monitoring for the
disease at scale rather than active sampling. A change in plant behavior could show indications of tampering by
bad actors when geological and meteorological variables have been accounted for. (Silva & et.al, 2021)
   Remote Sensing (RS) is a technique for obtaining information on an object without physical contact by
measuring the electromagnetic energy reflected/backscattered or emitted by the surface of the Earth (Freek D.
van der Meer, 2007).
   "A significant step forward in earth observation was made with the development of imaging spectrometry.
236 | AI / ML AND AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRIES [NICHOLS, HOOD, SINCAVAGE]

Imaging spectrometers measure reflected solar radiance from the Earth in many narrow spectral bands. Such a
spectroscopical imaging system can detect subtle absorption bands in the reflectance spectra and measure the
reflectance spectra of various objects with remarkably high accuracy. As a result, imaging spectrometry enables
better identification of objects at the Earth's surface and better quantification of the object properties than can
be achieved by traditional earth observation sensors such as Landsat TM and SPOT. " (Freek D. van der Meer,
2007)

   As a noncontact technique, we include in the definition of RS also spectral measurements acquired by
portable instruments such as handheld spectroradiometers (also called proximal sensing). These measurements
are processed and analyzed to retrieve information on the object observed (i.e., plant health, in this case). RS
is an indirect assessment technique, able to monitor vegetation conditions from a distance and evaluate the
spatial extent and patterns of vegetation characteristics and plant health in this application. Sensors can be
distinguished into active or passive; whether they emit artificial radiation and measure the energy reflected or
backscattered (active sensors), the reflected solar radiation, or the emitted thermal radiation (passive sensors).
(Martinelli, 2015)

MONITORING OF INVASIVE PLANTS

The effective and regular remote monitoring of agricultural activity is not always possible in developing
countries because access to cloud-based geospatial analysis platforms or expensive high-resolution satellite
images is not always available. High-resolution satellite images medium-resolution satellite images were used to
map the spatial distribution of sickle bush (Dichrostachys cinerea), an archetypal allochthonous invasive plant
in Cuba that is becoming impossible to control owing to its rapid growth in areas planted with sugar cane
in the Trinidad-Valle de Los Ingenios area (Cuba), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. (E. Moreno, 2021) (S.
Sincavage, 2022) details satellite imaging techniques monitoring of invasive plants.

FEEDLOT DENSITY DETECTION

The highly concentrated breeding and rearing practices of our livestock industry make it a vulnerable target
for terrorists because diseases could spread rapidly and be difficult to contain. For example, 80 and 90 percent
of grain-fed beef cattle production is concentrated in less than 5 percent of the nation's feedlots. Therefore,
deliberately introducing a highly contagious animal disease in a single feedlot could have serious economic
consequences. (epidemiology) (Agroterrorism: What Is the Threat and What Can Be Done About It?, 2004)

   There is a concern about creating transgenic plant pathogens, pests, or weeds resistant to conventional
control methods. This prospect has already been realized through developing a genetically mutant superweed,
resistant to current herbicides. The superweed was designed to "attack corporate monoculture" and target
genetically engineered crops. (Parker, 2002)

   According to Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Earth Observation Epidemiology, or tele-
epidemiology, is one of the most promising technologies to monitor feedlot density and diseases. Satellite
imaging detects the distinct environmental conditions that may serve as a refuge for the disease-carrying
animals. Electromagnetic spectra also provide useful information to make decisions regarding plant
physiological stress. (Martinelli, 2015) (APHIS & USDA, 2022)

CONCLUSIONS

Global agriculture / farming are converting to using AI. This translates directly into the global food growth,
production and delivery to consumers. The food industry is using the basic level of artificial intelligence.
Every day the role of AI is becoming vital due to its capability to escalate hygiene, food protection, and waste
management system. AI is going to transform the food processing industry because it has so much potential to
generate reasonable and healthier productivity for clients and employees. Employment of AI and ML in food
production and eatery businesses is already taking business to a new level by minimizing human mistakes in
manufacturing. AI enables low costs for packing as well as conveyance, increment in customer pleasing, rapid
services, voice searching, and more personalized orders. The impact of AI in this sector is global.

   However, despite the US's best efforts, the US will continue to be vulnerable to deliberate introductions of
exotic plant and animal diseases by terrorist groups.[23] The vulnerability to agricultural biological attack is a
consequence of intrinsically low security of agricultural targets, the technical ease of engagement, and the large
economic repercussions of even small outbreaks.

   The good news is that the US is aggressively stepping up its ISR efforts via satellite. Satellite intelligence on
agricultural and cattle feeding zones reduces the risks of successful attacks.[24]

[3] In the authors view, this is an extreme position by Dr. Zheng and the authors do not agree with the
totality of the statement. However, they agree with effects of naturally caused disasters and force majeure.
"Environmental footprints" is a tricky phrase. To the extent that man can provide sustainable practices
involving naturally caused climate events, we concur. However, the current use of climate hysteria with
penalties on the life sustaining element of carbon (or carbon credits) is a fraud and misuse of real scientific
information for political purposes. We agree with Dr Zheng that this is a global concern because the hysteria has
reached the level of almost political intrigue and power adjustment. For those who need further clarification

THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK
INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON]

LEARNING OUTCOMES

 1. The future of enhanced humans- explore the potential for our military, commercial and medical status.
 2. Understand the practical side of enhancing human capabilities and merging with machines
 3. Look into the future, explore a framework for humanities acceptance of Cyborgs/Enhanced Humans

   An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its
opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die
out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the
fact that the future lies with the youth.

   Paraphrased as "Science progresses one funeral at a time".
   -- Max Planck (Planck, 1949)

WHAT IS A CYBORG?

The Merriam-Webster dictionary definition is "a bionic human" (Merriam-Webster, 2023) whereas the
Britannica's expands the definition to "a person whose body contains mechanical or electrical devices and
whose abilities are greater than the abilities of normal humans" (Britannica). The term is a popular theme in
science fiction. Futurists are considering the theory and application. Modern science and medicine is well on
its way to realizing the definitions and pop culture references of cyborg in modern society. At its most base
comparison, a human with a prosthetics, by the definitions cited, could be (and in some cases, are) considered
a cyborg.

   This chapter will define what a cyborg is and how they are created, the current medical and scientific
research into enhanced humans inclusive of those who already consider themselves cyborgs and what direction
society is heading regarding human minds, bodies, and limbs whose enhanced abilities far outreach those who
are not. Risks will be considered, narrowly focusing on risks to society and to the enhanced humans themselves.
                                                         THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON] | 245

The working definition of Cyborgs for this text will be Cyborgs are enhanced humans with increased capability
resulting in increased human abilities.

   This chapter complements chapter 12 later in this text. The student reader will understand enhanced
human's potential to enable the future, understand the practical side of enhancing human capabilities and
merging with machines creating a framework for humanities acceptance of Cyborgs/Enhanced Humans.

HOW ARE CYBORGS CREATED?

Increasing human capability through mechanical or electrical means resulting in improved biological, bio-
mechanical or neurological human abilities. Mechanical means are inclusive of the range of prosthetics that
allow veterans who've lost limbs sustained in combat the ability to walk, to grab items through the pioneering
research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the field of Agonist-antagonist Myo-neural
Interface (AMI), a method to restore proprioception to persons with amputation, or the ability of amputees
to feel and have better control of their prosthetic limbs (MIT Media Lab). Physical implants like those of Amal
Graafstra whose radio frequency ID chips implanted in his hands allowing him to start his motorcycle (Swain,
2014) and remotely open doors; and Rob Spence, who lost vision in his right eye, then implanted a tiny camera,
producing a documentary about his life as a cyborgs (Swain, 2014). Future neurological advancements predict
brains implanted with chips that are modified by DNA.

   Medical and scientific research into prosthetics is the precursor to future advancement into cyborgs,
cybernetics, and the human-machine interface. The field covers advancements in the medical, scientific, and
commercial communities. The human-machine interface is inclusive of wearable technology to implanted
technology. Three current examples of medical, scientific, and commercial cyborg creation are Dr Stephen
Mann, who promotes wearable technology, Neil Harrison, a color-blind artist whose neurological implant
allows him to hear sound, and Hugh Herr at MIT builds prosthetic knees, legs and ankles that fuse
biomechanics with microprocessors to restore (and enhance) normal gait, balance, and speed.

   Stephen, Neil, and Hugh, and those cited above, chose their implants. They made the concise decision to
fuse mechanical, electrical and computer technology into their human form, increasing their human capability.
In his 2018 TED talk, Hugh Herr envisions that by the end of the 21st Century, nervous systems will be linked
to exoskeletons, augmenting humans' strength, and power. He extrapolates this human augmentation into
non-anthropomorphic structures such as wings, allowing humans the ability to fly (Herr, 2018).

     Figure 5-1 Neil Harbisson, a color-blind artist whose neurological implant allows him to hear
                                                           sound

   This generates questions on the future legal and moral structure for human-machine modification. Who
gets to approve modifications? When in the human growth cycle can (or should) modifications be made?
Will modifications become genetic, or remain implants? Before reaching legal maturity, much less physical
or mental maturity, where does the decision reside, with the parents or the individual? What will be the
societal impacts? How much government oversight will there be regarding regulations and oversight? Much
less religious and political ramifications.

HOW ARE MODIFICATIONS MADE?

Most of the progress in current medical and scientific technology is limited to surgical implants, and
prosthetics. Other research and innovation include the world of wearable computing. Dr Mann considers
himself a cyborg promoting a cyborg lifestyle. His experiments in wearable computing follows Moore's Law,
from the late 1970's evolving from backpack computers through augmented reality eyeglasses of the
2020's (Case, 2013). Dr Mann's view includes "unlike other computers (including laptops and PDAs), a
WearComp is inextricably intertwined with its wearer - WearComp's `always ready' characteristic leads to a
new form of synergy between human and computer" (Mann, 2012).

   This coincides with research into robotics and computing, the fields of creating android, and human-
like machines. The advances in Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, robotics, engineering, and
nanotechnology all portend cross-over potential between robotics research and cyborg research. Machines and
robots will eventually possess the capacity to learn. Artificial Intelligence's end state is to replicate human
intelligence, to reason, discover meaning, to generalize, and perform (McCarthy, 2006). Machine Learning, a
sub-field of AI, allows the computer to learn without programming (Brown, 2021). Following Moore's law,
it is inevitable that the distinct areas of research, development, and implementation of AI and robotics will
eventually merge with the medical and scientific research in bionics and wearable technology, creating cyborgs.

   In Darwin's The Origin of Species, he writes "Natural Selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power
incessantly ready for action, and is immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature
are to those of Art." (Darwin, 1859). Evolution can be characterized by adaptation for survival. Humans
environmental and climate change adaptation is exhibited by the differences in skin pigmentation. We have
evolved from hunter-gathers to the domestication of animals and grains leading to an agrarian society (Max,
2017). Humanity's current stage of evolution results from environmental pressure coupled with our own
nature to improve the world around us through technological and scientific progress The modern era is
no different, driven by medicine to restore their fellow humans' abilities, to science to increase humanities
capabilities, humanity is evolving. Into cyborgs.

THE CURRENT STATE OF CYBORGS (2023)
Neil Harbisson was born with achromatopsia, total color blindness. Rob Spence lost vision in his left eye.
Adrianne Haslet-Davis lost her foot in the Boston Marathon terror attack in 2013. All have chosen to become
cyborgs through medical procedures. Neil hears color through a fiber optic device and microchip implanted in
his skull. The antenna, above his right eye "...picks up the colors in front of him, and a microchip implanted in
his skull converts their frequencies into vibrations on the back of his head. Those become sound frequencies,
turning his skull into a sort of third ear" (Max, 2017). Rob Spence lost sight in his right eye after a weapons
accident as a teenager. He chooses to replace his eye with a miniaturized camera, recording his life first person
point of view of the world, declaring himself an Eyeborg (Kell, 2010). Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a ballroom
dancer lost her left leg in the 2013 terror attack on the Boston Marathon (Thompson, 2022). MIT's Media
Lab, built her a bionic limb, enabling her to regain her dancing life, through research expertise in prosthetics,
robotics, machine learning and biomechanics (Herr, 2014).

   The current state of medical research and surgical procedures combining machines with man will yield
enhanced humans, cyborgs whose abilities exceed those of their fellow humans. This section will explore the
current state (as of 2023) of research, development, and the lives of cyborgs. Along with prosthetics, eye
replacements, and bionics, the areas of brain-computer interfaces, Agonist-antagonist Myoneural Interface
(AMI), subdermal microchips, and exoskeletons are going to be reviewed.

   Rob Spence lost his playing with a gun at age 13. As an adult, he has replaced his eye with a prosthetic
eye fitted with a camera, recording his life as a "Eyeborg" (Warrick, 2017). His bionic eye, described as more a
spherical contact lens, consists of a battery, video camera, video transmitter, attached to a circuit board (Spence,
2014). The company Second Sight's product, the Argus II, "...converts images from cameras, into signals that
the electrodes implanted in the eye can use, and that the brain can interpret. The Argus II allows Fran Fulton,
66, who is blind due to retinitis pigmentosa - a degenerative eye disease that slowly causes light-sensitive cells in
the retina to die off, too see again through her camera equipped glasses. The Argus II is early in its development,

allowing Fran and the other 6 people equipped to see black & white pixelated image. Second Sights next phase
seeks to skip the retinal layer, and implant electrodes into the visual area of the brain (Eveleth, 2014).

   MIT (as of March 2023) uses a Microsoft HoloLens to design implement augmented reality (AR) system
with non-line-of-sight perception. This system augments AR headsets with radio frequency (RF) sensing
enabling the operator to see RFID tagged objects that are normally outside the spectrum of light for the
human eye. The tech utilizes innovative algorithms, radiation and bandwidth capabilities, and localization
of line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight objects. A driver for this innovative tech is the desired effect boosting
efficiency in manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, and retail. The outcome is creating efficiency in worker
labor by "...by visualizing assembly tasks, automatically labeling tools in the environment, and helping users
find parts they need. More generally, AR head- sets are expected to make workers more efficient by an- notating
their environments, visualizing their next tasks, and guiding them in executing these tasks (Boroushaki, Lam,

In 1998, Kevin Warwick, a professor of Department of Cybernetics at the University of Reading, self-
252 | THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON]

experimented with a silicon chip implanted in his arm allowing a computer to monitor his movements.
Communicating via radio waves to a network of antennas that transmitted signals to a computer programmed
to respond to his actions, a voice box saying "hello" as he entered rooms, or doors opening on his approach. His
first self-experiment consisted of a glass-capsule implanted under his skin, on top of the muscles. His following
attempt will focus on "biomedical signal processing - i.e., creating software to read the signals the implant
receives from my nervous system and to condition that data for retransmission" (Warwick, 2000). Warwick's
self-experiments complement research at Neural Engineering Clinic in Augusta, Maine using technology
treating patients with damaged central nervous systems to achieve basic muscle function and at Emory
University, Atlanta, GA, who implanted a transmitter in the brain of a stroke patient transmitted a signal from
the brain to a computer operating it (Warwick, 2000).

   Neuro-prosthetics, a multidisciplinary filed at the intersection of neurosciences and biomedical engineering,
whose focus is replacing or modulating areas of the nervous system impaired through disease degeneration
or accident. For 60 years, the field has evolved to the point of commercial application of the tech treating
cognitive functions and memory issues (Gupta, Vardalakis, & Wagner, 2023). Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI)
or are "device that translates neuronal information into commands capable of controlling external software
or hardware such as a computer or robotic arm. BMIs are often used as assisted living devices for individuals
with motor or sensory impairments." Brain Control Interfaces (BCI) a system that analyzes signals from the
central nervous system and translates them into machine commands (Nature, 2023). Synchron is a neural
interface company that designs and develops an endovascular, implantable brain-computer interface, which
allows a patient's thoughts to be transmitted wirelessly through the skin to control an array of digital
devices (Zomorodi, Gutierrez, & Meshkinpour, 2023). Their product Stentrode -- "an implantable brain-
computer interface that collects and wirelessly transmits information directly from the brain, without the need
for open surgery" During human trials, Phil O'Keefe, whose paralysis cannot use his hands or fingers, is able to
Tweet his thoughts using Synchron's tech using blue-tooth (Oxley, 2022).

   Bionics, as defined by Britannica, is the science of constructing artificial systems that have some of the
characteristics of living systems (Britannica, 2022). Merriam-Webster defines cybernetics as the science of
communication and control theory that is concerned especially with the comparative study of automatic
control systems (such as the nervous system and brain and mechanical-electrical communication
systems) (Merriam-Webster, 2023). They both use the study of living systems, bionics searching for innovative
uses of machines and systems, where cybernetics pursues the reason behind living beings control systems and
processes.
   Human augmentation, the addition of robotic body parts that increase our capability, is being worked
on at Cambridge University. They have designed a 3D thumb to be added to any hand. Dani Clode, the
designer, stresses that, in addition to assisting those missing limbs, the augmented thumb does not take away
from the user, seeking to increase ability and capability. This device, instead of using brain control interface, is
"connected to two wrist-based motors that are hooked up to a battery and microcontroller on the upper arm.
This system is wirelessly connected to microcontrollers mounted on the wearer's shoes or ankles, which are
connected to pressure sensors underneath the two big toes." (Davis, 2023)
   Prosthetics range from a simple replacement limb to limbs that can manipulate objects, hands that grasp,
and lower limbs that articulate at joints to emulate movement. Simple prosthetics that can grasp are designed
as described above, the wearer manipulates an interface to articulate the prosthetic hands. In the Massachusetts

Institute of Technology labs, they are conducting research and application into Agonist-antagonist Myoneural
Interface (AMI) and Neuro-Embodied Design. AMI closes the gap in conventional prosthetics providing the
wearer proprioception, the ability to sense position, speed, and torque of their limbs, allowing precise control
of their limbs. AMI's goal is to restore amputees with proprioception (Hsieh).

   Dr Hugh Herr, of the MIT Media Lab, director of the biomechatronic research group and co-director
of the MIT Center for Extreme Bionics, describes bionics as "this glorious interplay between biology and
engineering design." He himself is a double amputee who enjoys full ability to walk, run and climb due to
AMI and neuro-embedded design which he describes as a method to "co-design the biological body with [a]
synthetic construct to maximize bi-directional communication between the device and the human nervous
system." (Snyder, 2021). Or, a bionic limb, powered by a computer, that sends and receives signals from the
central nervous system. AMI and neuro-embedded design's practical effects are demonstrated in two TED
talks by Dr Herr, culminating in the stories of Adrianne Haslet-Davis, who lost her leg in the Boston Marathon
bombing, re-gaining the ability to climb again (Herr, 2014) and Jim Ewing, regaining the ability to mountain

   In an anatomical sense, an exoskeleton is a rigid or articulated envelope that supports and protects the
soft tissues of certain animals (Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica, 2017). In human sense, an exoskeleton
is application of robotics and biomechatronic towards the augmentation of humans in the performance
of a variety of tasks (Exoskelton Report). In simpler terms, an exoskeleton is a tool, using robotics, that
exponentially increases the capability of the human form. The International Federation of Robotics classifies
robots in two sectors, Service Robots and Manufacturing Robots (Muller, 2022), where exoskeletons can
cross-over into both realms. One source that provides a survey of the exoskeleton sector adds Consumer,
Industrial, Medical and Military applications to the mix. The ExoskeletonReport.com identifies 120
companies (as of April 2023) that provide exoskeletons in one (or more) of their categories (Exoskelton
Report).
   Consumer applications include sports and educations exoskeletons. Industrial applications range from arm,
back and limb support to tools use and powered gloves. The medical applications garner the largest range of
applications and companies provide exoskeletons. Medical uses include upper and lower body fixed and mobile
rehabilitate and assistive functions (Exoskelton Report). Medical exoskeletons support faster therapy, recovery
and rehabilitation from injuries or damage to the central nervous system including exoskeletons enabling
wheelchair bound patients the ability to stand, walk, turn and climb (2020). The smallest tracked category,
the military sector, possess the potential to have the most outsized impact on the military and civilian sector.

The initial aim of military applications is to create a distinct advantage to Soldiers to accomplish their mission
and complete their task. Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, in partnership with
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), develop exoskeletons that reduce fatigue and
minimize Solider injury. DARPA TALOS (Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit) projects goals is to develop
an exoskeleton that us "Engineered with full-body ballistics protection; integrated heating and cooling systems;
embedded sensors, antennas, and computers; 3D audio (to indicate where a fellow warfighter is by the sound of
his voice); optics for vision in various light conditions; life-saving oxygen and hemorrhage controls" (Jacobson,
2015).

   The word "cyborg," coined by Manfred Clynes (1960), is a combination of "CYBernetic" and "ORGanism"
(cyborg conference INTRO). In this text, the working definition of a cyborg is the increase in human
capability through mechanical or electrical means resulting in improved biological, bio-mechanical or
neurological human abilities (author, 2023). Further classifying cyborgs into a taxonomy would be helpful
later when discussing the legal, moral, and ethical status of cyborgs. Futurists are establishing a theoretical
discussion of class and type of cyborg to set a framework. From the 2021 Cyborg Conference, Monika
Michalowska, Steve Fuller and Steve Mann provide a "fundamental taxonomy of cyborgs: a Type I cyborg is
one in which a human enters a vessel or other environment (e.g., boat, "wearables," spacesuit), and a Type II
cyborg is one in which a vessel enters a human (e.g., "implantable"), or hybrids of Type I and Type II (Mann
et. al., 2021)." (Michalowska, 2021). Cyborgs taxonomy can be further categorized in division and category
based on structure and role. The division of cyborgs could be biomedical cyborgs, digital cyborgs, and robotic
cyborgs. Categorization could include material cyborgs and information cyborgs (Michalowska, 2021).

WHERE ARE WE HEADED (WITH CYBORGS)?

General (retired) Paul Gorman described a version of 21st Century Cyborg warriors for DARPA in 1985.
He described a "integrated-powered exoskeleton" that "...offered protection against chemical, biological,
electromagnetic, and ballistic threats, including direct fire from a .50-caliber bullet" and "incorporated audio,
visual, and haptic [touch] sensors". He imagined that each "each soldier would have his own physiological
specifications embedded on a chip within his dog tags. And "he would insert one dog-tag into a slot under the
chest armor, thereby loading his personal program into the battle suit's computer." (Jacobson, 2015). In Annie
Jacobson's article, she reminds the reader "That connecting the human brain to a machine would produce a
matchless fighter has not been lost on DARPA."

   Imagine the combing of the current medical and tech research, development and practical in robotics,
bionics, prosthetics, brain-machine/brain-computer interfaces into a Cyborg, the combination of human,
computer and machine that exceeds human capability. In the previous section, we described the current state
of Cyborgs, all external to the human body. But what of internal to the brain and body? At the atomic level
and neural level. This section will discuss Nanotechnology, neuro-interfaces, and neural networks.

   Nanorobots are microscopic machines small enough to flow through human blood veins. One use of
nanorobots that is applicable to Cyborgs is real-time monitoring and imaging. Nanorobots can be outfitted
with monitors, sensors, and the capability to deliver medicine at the cellular level as well as the potential
to conduct surgical procedures at the nano-level. Potential uses of sensors include real-time monitoring of
physiological parameters of blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose levels. The monitor nanorobots would be
fitted with transmitters to communicate with medical personal in real-time. Imaging sensors allows doctors
to see the level of detail not available in current X-ray, MRI, and CTI scans. Nanorobots, controlled by
doctors could perform minimally invasive procedures and deliver medicine to the cellular level increasing their
effectiveness and reduce surgical complications (Saikia, 2023).

   In Section II, Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) and Brain-Control Interfaces (BCI) discussion focused on the
devices that are implanted in human's brain's that are capable of transmitting control signals to external devices
and chips implanted to monitor the central nervous systems sending signals to external devices. Parkinson's
Disease, Alzheimer's and paralyzed patients benefit from BMI & BCI, regaining some of their cognitive
functions and the ability to control prosthetics limbs. The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), whose end state
is to replicate human intelligence, to reason, discover meaning, to generalize, and perform (McCarthy, 2006)
using machine learning, big data and algorithms possess the potential to advance the field of neural interfaces.
Neural interfaces could combine current BMI & BCI with AI to exponentially expand human capability.

   Neural interface is linking an AI brain chip with an external AI interface to communicate with machines and
the external world just with thoughts (Saikia, 2023). Current neuron interfaces include devices for intracellular
recordings, extracellular recordings, and optical imaging recording (Wang, Liu, Wang, Zhao, & Zhang, 2022).
A 2022 article from Nature.com Microsystems & Nanoengineering section presents a survey of current and
future AI Neural interface pathways including:

  · Neuromodulation, the stimulation, or chemical substances applied directly to the nervous system to
      modify nerve cell activity.

  · Bi-directional feedback for BCI control of prosthetics.
  · Increased Artificial sensory neuron devices, which could "mimic complicated sensing and processing

      functions in biological systems, which can convert external stimuli into electrical signals"
  · Artificial neuron sensory devices for mimicking the human sensory system. Bimodal artificial sensory

      neuron (BASE) realized the fusion of visual and haptic modalities. Pressure sensors and photodetectors

   A human's cognitive perception of its external environment is a complicated fusion of multiple sensory
inputs. The implications of neural networks and Artificial Intelligence stands to aid in cyborg development.

networks to be realized, outside of current research and development. The Figure below depicts current
and future areas for the prospects of neuron interfaces. The article and survey conclude it best stating "AI

neural network algorithms will propel the development of neuron devices and improve neuroscience research"

   Where does genetic engineering fit into the development of cyborgs? Genetic enhancement covers the
willful alteration of genes to be more than human, be it strength, cognition, or other traits. Genetic
enhancements parallel cyborg enhancements as they alter the human form resulting in increased capability. It
is important to note the downstream effects of genetic enhancements. If a genetic enhancement only applies
266 | THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON]

to one individual, then the genetic line remains normal, it is when the genetic modifications enter the gene
pool, will the line be passed on to future generations and change the human genome (Barfiled, 2022). There
is much debate on the efficacy, legality, moral, ethical, and societal effects of deliberate genetic modification,
some of which will be discussed in the following sections. As this chapter focuses on cyborgs, the enhancement
of human capacity with machines, gene therapy, the delivery of "a copy of a normal gene into the cells of
a patient in an attempt to correct a defective gene" (Barfiled, 2022) will not be discussed beyond the above
general explanation for awareness.

   CYBORGS, WHAT ARE THE RISKS?
   "Neuro-prosthetic devices and implants that are connected to an internal network that is itself connected to
the Internet, and that are also vulnerable to infections from laptops or other device. The problem of implants
being affected with a software virus is exacerbated by the fact that manufacturers often will not allow their
equipment to be modified, even to add security features." (Barfiled, 2022)

RISK TO SOCIETY, A PERSPECTIVE

As a noun, risk means someone or something that creates or suggests a hazard. And as a verb, it is defined as to
incur the risk or danger of (Merriam-Webster, 2023). So "Risk" implies a hazard or danger. Broadly thinking,
is there danger or hazard posed by Cyborgs? Conversely, is there danger or hazard to Cyborgs? This section
will illuminate the topics of risk and Cyborgs, the risk to Cyborgs and what is the risk posed by Cyborgs.

   What could be the risks of a cyborg? Would general society accept Cyborgs? Conversely, would Cyborgs
want to be considered human by societies definitions? Would the answers change when replacing society with
"government." In a world with finite resources, many of the advancements described above are currently in the
research & development phase. Once Cyborgs are accepted, once the Singularity occurs, what is the risk to the
acquisition of components required for industrial scale production of Cyborgs?

   A 2022 Pew Research topic of AI and Human Enhancement provides some prospective of what the
public's understanding and acceptance of enhanced human, Cyborgs, is. The survey covers six topics in the
advancement of AI and human enhancement that possess the potential to alter society, a few of which are
germane to this section, the possibilities of enhanced humans, enhanced cognitive function from computer
chips implanted in the brain, and exoskeletons with AI in the workforce. In 2022, caution is the fundamental
theme of the survey results. Caution relating to AI and human enhancements effect on the disparities between
humans and enhanced humans and the unintended consequences of these advancements and developments.
(Rainie, Funk, Anderson, & Tyson, 2022).

   The survey results run the gamut of American public reactions to Cyborgs, and the related technology
advancements. Some findings include:

  · For societal benefits, more Americans view the good over bad in the use of robotic exoskeletons with a
                                                    THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON] | 267

   built-in AI system to increase strength for manual labor jobs (33% vs. 24%).
· Americans are cautious about a future with widespread use of computer chip implants in the brain to

   allow people to process information far more quickly and accurately: 56% say this would be a bad idea
   for society, while just 13% think this would be a good idea.
· Uncertainty is among the themes seen in emerging public views of AI and human enhancement
   applications. For instance, 42% are not sure how the widespread use of robotic exoskeletons in manual
   labor jobs would impact society. 45% say they are equally excited and concerned about the increased use
   of AI programs in daily life, compared with 37% who say they are more concerned than excited and 18%
   who say they are more excited than concerned.

   What is agreed upon across the board, are the mitigating steps making the applications of human
enhancement acceptable into society. For example, 7 in 10 would find driverless cars acceptable if they were
labeled as such and easily identifiable. In terms of computer chip enhancements in the brain, acceptability
rose if the effects could be turned on or off and implanted without surgery. Over 40% of survey respondents
are more excited about the potential of enhancements that provide health benefits or disease prevention.
Interestingly, 8 in 10 would "opt against" computer chip enhancements for themselves yet 6 in 10 respond that
270 | THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON]

there will be societal pressure to allow and receive these implants should they become widely available. The
public are more accepting of enhancement that can be turned on or off, such as exoskeletons, than they are a
brain implants that increase cognitive function (Rainie, Funk, Anderson, & Tyson, 2022).

   Two interesting concerns from the Pew Research survey highlight potential risks to Cyborgs and society,
the unintended consequences of cyborg enhancements, and the amount at type of government oversight and
regulation. The major concerns highlighted include hackers gaining access to personal information, unwanted
changes to the brain and chip malfunctions. The concern for government regulation lie along the lines
of what is "enough" regulation and oversight, in the development of enhancements. What risks constitute
regulation, such as the Indiana (and 10 other states) banning employers from requiring workers having devices
implanted in their bodies (Marr, 2020). The survey does address the socio-economic and religious impact
from respondents view-points, that enhancements "meddle with nature" and potentially increase the social-
economic gap between enhanced humans, a valid concern outside the scope of this section (Rainie, Funk,
Anderson, & Tyson, 2022).

   The Pew Research is one viewpoint of the risks of Cyborgs, from a societal perspective. What of the
risk to cyborgs themselves? Looking at the current the advancements in Cyborg research, technology, and
implementation discussed in Section III, the question of risks, vulnerabilities, impacts, and countermeasures
are relevant to the safety of the cyborg, and the security of the technology (including personably identifiable
and personal health information).
RISK TO CYBORGS, A CASE STUDY
Section III covers the current state of Cyborgs. The research, development and current technologies include
eye replacements, implanted microchips/RFID devices, brain-computer/brain-machine interfaces, subdermal
microchips, prosthetics, bionics, and exoskeletons. As stand-alone technologies, each contains inherent risk.
272 | THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON]

When considered as part of a Cyborg entity, the risk potential increases significantly, as individual lives and
societal impacts are contemplated.

   For the sake of space and brevity, this text will consider a risk analysis and assessment of a select few of the
Cyborg technologies, using the Ryan-Nichols Risk Assessment methodology. For review, the Ryan-Nichols
Risk Assessment is a threat focused methodology analyzing risk as an equation to identify threat scenarios,
business objectives, improve probability calculations and predictions using probability ranges, simulate
exploitable scenarios and incorporate countermeasures to reduce risk.

RISK = THREATS X VULNERABILITIES X IMPACTS /

COUNTERMEASURES                   EQ. 5-1

Where: THREATs are real, act on a system, and represent the possibility that the attack vectors become
accessible for exploitation. (The attacker has the necessary time and resources to conduct the exploit.)
VULNERABILITIES are inherent weaknesses in the information system and represent vulnerabilities
becoming successfully exploited. IMPACT is the business value of a successful exploit.
COUNTERMEASURES represent the technical mitigations/solutions or probability that a mix of counter-
technologies will reduce the active THREATS on a system. The above equation is used to calculate the Initial
Risk Assessment (IRA) before any perturbation by Threats.

   At time state = 0, we note that Vulnerabilities are constant and always present, and Impact is just a "delta
number" and a constant. Threats and Countermeasures are independent variables; Risk is the dependent
variable, Using calculus, both Vulnerabilities and Impact drop out of the IRA equation to give a compressed
form:

RISK = THREATS / COUNTERMEASURES  EQ 5-2

   Source: (Nichols R. K., 2022)

   As a case study for the Ryan-Nichols risk assessment, consider this excerpt from Woodrow Barfield's
"Cyber-Humans" in the chapter "Cognitive Liberty, Brain Implants, and Neuro-prosthesis"

   ...a British scientist and former student of Professor Kevin Warwick, Dr. Mark Gasson, has claimed to be
the first person to become infected with a computer virus. How can this be possible? In Dr. Gasson's case,
purposively as part of a proof-of-concept study, but in the future, cyborg hackers could spread a virus to a
person's mind by accessing brain-implant technology or by hacking into a network of wirelessly connected
brains. In Dr. Gasson's study, a chip was inserted in his hand which was then infected with a software virus.
Of relevance to a law of cyborgs, Dr. Gasson showed that the chip was able to pass on the computer virus
to external control systems--meaning a person with cyborg "infected" technology could transmit a virus to

a machine external to the cyborg. But more importantly, if other implanted chips within a person's body,
including neuro-prosthesis, had been connected to the system they too would have been infected by the
virus" (2022).

   With the above in mind, for this scenario, considered the near future, with a Cyborg, an enhanced human
who has an RFID chip implanted in their organic limb (a hand), brain-controlled interface link to their
external workstation and a neuro-link to their bionic limb (an arm-hand device and lower, limb hip to foot
device). The possibility of an AI network or connected to the Internet of Things is a very real possibility but
will not be considered for this analysis. Alone, each of these tech's includes their own risks, vulnerabilities,
impacts, and countermeasures. As a system, each threat vector impacts the system, whereas each
countermeasure reduces the risk to the system.

   Each of the individual elements presents include vulnerabilities, vectors for exploitation or attack. RFID
chips are common in 2023, used in a multitude of functions. Airlines track baggage using RFID tags and
the FDA approved company VeriChip Corp. whose chips uses are security, art, and body-hacking (Barfiled,
2022). An RFID chip manufactured from various components, what is the security of the supply-chain of the
hardware. The BCI, also manufactured and surgically installed, transmits an RF signal from the brain to the
machine or workstation. Is that signal easily identifiable, and secure, on the electro-magnetic spectrum?

   The bionic limb, whether an AI enabled prosthetics of the future, or the current MIT neuro-embed
designed AMI limbs of Dr Hugh Herr, also present similar exploitable vulnerabilities, and vectors. A
commonality of each of these components individually, or together in a Cyborg system could be their wireless
communication devices.

   Wireless communications are vulnerable today. They are comprised of mobile computing and
communicating on the EMS via the radio frequency spectrum, satellite communications or infrared spectrum.
They are low quality of service, low power and low bandwidth emanating from small devices. Historical threats
include RF signal interception, mobile service access, and wireless network interference. Current security
measures layers are the physical, datalink, network layers and the transfer layer, application layer.

Cyborg system in our case study and scenario.

   The Ryan-Nichols assessment provides a framework for a qualitative and quantitative assessment (see
Table 5-2). The threats presented could originate from internal or external to the Cyborg. To the threat
actor, does the return on investment of the exploit or attack carry value to the perpetrator, revealing access
points and exploit techniques? When assessing countermeasure, keep in mind a couple of maxims, threats
evolve faster than countermeasures and the critical thinking mindset of action-reaction-counteraction. The
countermeasures identified should be universal, but are not, as wireless communications are vulnerable as of
this writing. The possibility of the risks remaining constant through the Singularity are likely.

CONCLUSION 1, THE SINGULARITY
   "The Singularity is that point in or development time when artificially intelligent machines equal or surpass

humans in intelligence." (Barfiled, 2022)
                                        Figure 5-23 The Singularity Timeline

   Source: (Kurweil, 2005)
   There is no one definition of the Singularity. Each futurist, or trans-humanist, applies their perspective
to the overarching theme of rapid technological growth of genetics, nano-technological and robotics that is
leading to a merger of man and machine. Or Cyborgs are inevitable.
   Three interlocking developments are shaping the Singularity, genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics. An
explanation of the progress towards the Singularity can be understood by applying Moore's Law and
Monsanto's Law (Horner, 2008). Moore's law states each new generation of computer chip provides twice as
many components per unit cost, each of which operates faster the number of transistors that could fit on a
                                                         THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON] | 277

single computer chip had doubled every year for six years from the beginnings of integrated circuits in 1959
and Monsanto's law, which states that the ability to identify and use genetic information doubles every 12 to
24 months. These laws of accelerating returns leads to Ray Kurzweil's Singularity definition "...It's a future
period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will
be irreversibly transformed." (Kurweil, 2005).

   One path leading to Kurzweil's definition is his own Six Epochs of Evolution. His Epochs "... works through
indirection; it creates a capability and then uses that capability to evolve to the next stage. Epoch One: Physics
and Chemistry is the era of the emergence of patterns of matter and energy whilst Epoch Two: Biology and
DNA represents the emergence of life and self-replicating organisms. Epoch Three: Brains - is the epoch of the
emergence of `information in neural patterns' leading to the human ability to conceive abstract models of the
world. Epoch Four is the epoch of technology - seen in terms of the emergence of information technology and
a rapid acceleration of technological evolution as compared with biological evolution. Epoch Five is the merger
of human intelligence with machine intelligence. Epoch Six: The Universe Wakes Up this post-singularity
period begins to be described as `...the ultimate destiny of the Singularity and of the universe' (Kurweil, 2005).

   Where do Cyborgs fit into The Singularity? An argument could be, they are riding the wave towards
The Singularity. Consider the working definition used in this chapter, increasing human capability through
mechanical or electrical means resulting in improved biological, bio-mechanical or neurological human
abilities. Or Cyborgs are enhanced humans with increased capability, derived from the intersection of genetics,
nanotechnology and robotics resulting in increased human abilities. Remember the scenario in Risk to
Cyborgs, an enhanced human who has an RFID chip implanted in their organic limb, brain-controlled
interface link to their external workstation and a neuro-link to their bionic limb. Individually, all of these occur
today, circa 2023. Look quickly to the future and the Cyborg is working in Space, as the NASA studies of the
1960's envisioned.

CONCLUSION 2, CYBORGS AND SPACE

"Altering man's bodily functions to meet the requirements of extraterrestrial environments would be more
than logical than providing an earthly environment for him in space...Artifact-organism systems which would
extend man unconscious, self-regulatory controls are one possibility." (Clynes & Kilne, 1960)

   In 1960, scientists, researchers and futurists were thinking about the practical applicability of cyborgs
supporting extra-terrestrial exploration. Two researchers, Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline, in 1960 wrote
about the biological impediments to man's long term exploration of space, explaining that man's adaption to
the space environment by incorporating exogenous means would induce the biological changes allowing man
to function, to "live in space qua natura" They argue that man as a cyborg, rather than monitoring external
systems to keep him alive, "...is to provide an organizational system in which such robot-like problems are taken
care of automatically and unconsciously, leaving man free to explore, to create, to think, and to feel." (Clynes
& Kilne, 1960).

   Clynes and Kline discuss some of the various physiological and psychological problems man's space travel
would encounter. They determine the Cyborg will enhance man's natural functions to increase his ability in
extra-terrestrial environments, lasting from a few weeks to years. Functions they discuss include Wakefulness,
Radiation Effects, Metabolic and Hypothermic Controls, Oxygenation and Carbon Dioxide Removal, Fluid
Intake and Output, Enzyme Systems, Vestibular Functions, Cardiovascular Control, Muscular Maintenance,
Perceptual Problems, Pressure, Variations in External Temperature, Gravitation, Magnetic Fields, Sensory
Invariance and Action Deprivation, and Psychoses to be identified and controlled. (1960).

   Source: (Driscoll, 1963)
   Building off the Clynes and Kline research, NASA commissioned the CYBORG STUDY in 1963. The
study's goal is to continue the theoretical ideas proposed by Clynes and Kline, rather than modifying the
environment, to physically adapt the human body to the rigors of living in space. As written by Robert
Driscoll, the CYBORG Study is a "study of man and the theoretical possibility of incorporating artificial
organism drugs and/or hypothermia as integral parts of life support systems in scale craft design of the future,
and of reducing metabolic demands and the attendant life support requirements" (Driscoll, 1963). Clynes,
Kline and Driscoll all recognized that man physiological structure is well-adapted to terrestrial life, and from
the initial NASA manned space flights of the 1960's, any future long-term extra-terrestrial endeavors require
the study of how to adapt man's biological and mental facilities to operate outside the physical parameters of
Earth.

FINAL THOUGHTS
This chapter reviews current, circa 2023, research, development, and practical application of where
humankind is regarding Cyborgs. Some define the human transition to cyborg when using any mechanical
implementation to improve capability, from a simple bicycle to the pocket computers that are today's smart
devices. Following the origins of the word Cyborg, combining Cybernetic and Organism, incorporating
external and internal components extending and expanding a human's capability to adapt to new
280 | THE REALITY OF CYBORGS AND A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE [JOHNSON]

environments, this chapter presents a broad overview of prosthetics, bionic limbs, neural implants, and
exoskeletons. The combining of Artificial Intelligence into prosthetics, brain-controlled interfaces and
Augmented/Virtual reality long with the research into Nano-technology and neuro-interfaces point to future
of where humankind could be headed as Cyborgs. Cyborgs are inevitable!

MACHINES HACKING MACHINES -
TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER]

PREVIEW

This chapter provides an overview of how Alan Turing's legacy has contributed to our current and future
technological development. He is often credited as being one of the founders of Artificial intelligence (AI) and
Computer Science. Turing is best known as being part of the team that cracked ENGIMA in World War II.
His early research led to the development of theoretical computer science with the creation of the "Turing
Machine." This 1930's research by Turing established the roots of our modern-day computers and software.
Theoretical computer science assisted with building of the Bombe, the machine that would break the code
of the German WWII ENGIMA encryption machine. Alan Turing continued researching and publishing
throughout his life. In 1950, he authored an influential paper titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence.".
This resulted in the "Turing Test," an applied theory to measure machine intelligence and the ability to mimic
human behavior. The "Turing Test" is still in use and applied by AI developers as AI technology continues to
advance and grow.

STUDENT OBJECTIVES

After reading this chapter, students should be able to do the following:

  · Explain how Alan Turing's research of mathematics and algorithms led to the creation of different
      computer systems and a basis for developing software.

  · Describe the significant impact on the field of encryption and encryption techniques used today when
      the Bombe mechanical device was used to crack the ENGIMA machine in World War II.

  · Explain how the "Turing Test" is relevant today.
  · Discuss how Alan Turing's research and creations laid the foundation for computer science and artificial

      intelligence.

As one of the founders of computer science and the father of AI Alan Turing's legacy is endless. The "Turing
Machine" laid the foundation for the development of modern computer architecture and the field of
theoretical computer science. The development of theoretical computer science, the study of algorithms,
computational complexity, and formal models of computation. Theoretical computer science gives an
understanding of the fundamental limits of computation and to develop a mathematical theory of algorithms
and computational processes. The cracking of the Enigma code during World War II had a significant impact
on the field of encryption and laid the foundation for many of the encryption techniques used today. The
process to break the German encryption required mechanical devices, such as the Bombe machine, to perform
and highlight calculations. Turing had advanced cryptanalysis using statistical analysis. The protection key
management was shown to be essential for future wars. The theory of the "Turing Test" went a step further
to measure the machine's intelligence and skill. This gave the foundation for testing and creating artificial
intelligence.

THE TURING MACHINE

During Alan Turing's two years (1936-38) at Princeton University, he cultivated the concept of theoretical
computer science. Theoretical computer science is a field of computer science that studies the limits of
computation and the foundations of computer science. It deals with abstract concepts and mathematical
models that define the capabilities and limitations of computers and algorithms. Theoretical computer science
encompasses a wide range of topics, including algorithms and computational complexity, automata theory,
formal languages and grammars, and the study of algorithms for solving mathematical problems. It also
includes the study of algorithms for solving problems in other fields, such as cryptography, game theory,
and optimization. The goal of theoretical computer science is to understand the fundamental limits of
computation and to develop a mathematical theory of algorithms and computational processes. This theory
provides a basis for the design and analysis of algorithms and the development of new computing technologies.

   The Turing machine is a theoretical machine proposed by Alan Turing in 1936. It is considered a
mathematical model of computation and a cornerstone of computer science. The Turing machine is a
theoretical machine that consists of an infinite tape divided into cells, each cell containing a symbol. It also has
a read/write head that can read the symbol in the current cell and write a new symbol in that cell. The Turing
machine operates in a series of steps, which are determined by a set of rules called the transition function.
The transition function takes the current state of the machine, the symbol read by the read/write head, and
determines the next state of the machine, the symbol to be written in the current cell, and the direction the
read/write head should move.

   The Turing machine can be thought of as a simple computer that can perform any calculation that is
computationally feasible, given an appropriate set of rules and input. This is the basis of the Church-Turing
286 | MACHINES HACKING MACHINES - TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER]

thesis, which states that any computation that can be performed by any machine can also be performed by a
Turing machine. Alan Turing studied under Alonzo Church in 1936 at Princeton University. Prior to meeting
Turing, Church conducted research on a class of functions that coincide with the intuitively computable
functions that can be evaluated by algorithms and computer programs (Deutsch & Marshall , 2022). Church
also provided first example of a particular significant function that is not computable, meaning a certain
problem of elementary number theory is unsolvable: there is no way it could be solved by algorithmic means
(Deutsch & Marshall , 2022). The Turing Machine demonstrates the framework for the design and analysis of
algorithms and computational processes, laying the foundation for computer science.

   The concept of the Turing machine can be applied to modern computing systems, and in this context, it is
possible for machines to hack other machines. This can happen through a variety of means, such as exploiting
vulnerabilities in software or hardware, using malware or other malicious software, or using social engineering
techniques to trick a machine into revealing its secrets. In the field of cybersecurity, modern computers and
networks can be vulnerable to hacking, and the development of advanced intrusion detection systems, which
can analyze network traffic to identify and block malicious activities is a response to this problem. These
systems can also learn from past attacks to improve their ability to detect and prevent future ones. Additionally,
machine learning can be used to detect and analyze anomalies in the network to identify potential threats and
can also be used to develop machine-learning-based malware detection systems. The concept of the Turing
machine proves the possibility for machines to hack other machines.

ENIGMA MACHINE V. BOMBE MACHINE

As Britain faces World War II (WWII), Alan Turing's research is vital to assist in changing the course of
WWII. The Turing Machine as a foundation for computer science, the first machine hacking machine event
(outside of theory) occurred between the German Army Enigma Machine and the Turing-Welchman Bombe
Machine leading to the end of WWII. There were several factors that played into the success of machine
hacking machine.

   In 1938, British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) set up the Government Code & Cypher School (GC&CS),
a top-secret program at Bletchley Park. The converted private estate in Milton Keynes was home to thousands
of WWII codebreakers, an elite team of mathematicians, linguists, classicists, and intelligence officers. The
recruits were exceptional young men and women recruited from Britain's elite universities (Giovanni, 2021).
Others were recruited by GC&CS through the newspaper, Daily Telegraph. The paper hosted a contest of
solving the cryptic crossword with-in twelve minutes (Bearne, 2018). The GC&CS was organized by collection
of Huts. Each Hut was contained with their own function and purpose, not to distract from one another.
Alan Turing oversaw Hut 8, Naval Ultra Enigma Machine Ciphers. Gordon Welchman led Hut 6, Army, and
Airforce Ultra Enigma Machine Ciphers. Hut 6 additional was the Machine Room, plus the Decoding Room
and Registration Room (Giovanni, 2021). Bletchley Park's sole purpose was to crack the German Enigma
Machine to save lives and stop Hitler's movement.

   The German Enigma Cipher Machine was used to send encrypted messages during WWII. For each letter
that was tapped in, another letter would come out so messages would be received in code (BBC News, 2011).
In 1931, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, was an employee of the German Cipher Office. Tempted by greed, Schmidt
sells the instruction manual and key setting instructions to French Intelligence. With a picture and related
documents of the German Enigma Cipher Machine, the French notice a unique characteristic. The Enigma
Cipher Machine was widely available to others, the German version had a front plug board. Schmidt, French
code name Asché, provided additional German Enigma Machine information to the French for several years
to follow.

   In 1932, France shared the German Enigma Machine information with Poland. Immediately Polish
mathematician /cryptologist Marian Rejewski began his work to break the Enigma. In 1939, the French hosted
a meeting with Britain and Poland to discuss intelligence cooperation, suggesting that all three countries
working together would increase the probability of breaking the Enigma. An agreement was reached on
sharing communications traffic intelligence, any problems with intelligence and any breakthroughs with the
Enigma. A document is drawn assigning each country a letter, X for France, Y for London, and Z for Poland.

   The French suspected Poland was not sharing their breakthroughs, their suspicion was correct. The Polish
mathematician /cryptologist Marian Rejewski began to formulate equations for the Enigma rotor, leading a
break into the Enigma machine since the handoff of intelligence in 1932. The British and French codebreakers
did not have much success in reading the German Enigma messages. Polish authorities did not reveal their work
to the British and French until July 1939 when the advance of war was getting serious in Poland (BBC News,
2011). The three countries met in Warsaw to review Poland's discoveries in breaking the German Enigma
Machine. Poland's hand was forced into calling the meeting, the small collective of Polish codebreakers became
overwhelmed by the German Army changing the Enigma settings each day and adding two new rotors into
rotation for their Enigma Machines. The Polish explained their mockup of the German Enigma Machine,
which became obsolete with the recent changes from Germany. The original German Enigma Machine had
3 rotors; rotors assisted with the increasing the difficulty of the encryption. Three rotors produced 6
permutations. Adding two additional rotors into rotation resulted in 60 permutations, strengthening the
German encryption beyond the number of codebreakers in Poland. German commanders had the ability to
communicated with field units encoded by messages encoded on Enigma machines and sent by wireless using
290 | MACHINES HACKING MACHINES - TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER]

Morse code (The National Museum of Computing, n.d.). Each German high command, about 24 in all, had
its own wireless network and daily key settings (The National Museum of Computing, n.d.). Additionally,
Poland shared with the French and British Intelligence other codebreaking efforts to entice their allies into
assisting with solving their engineering problem.

   The Polish intelligence gave enough information for Turing to build a new Bombe. His approach was
based on the use of `cribs' (comparing patterns of the encrypted message and a known portion of plain text)
to break the key (The National Museum of Computing, n.d.). British listing posts, Y Stations, copied the
German messages and sent them to Bletchley Park to be run through the Bombe. The Bombe was working
but the processing speed was inconstant and could not provide real-time data. In 1940, Gordon Welchman
added a diagonal board to Turing's Bombe, (which dramatically reduced the number of invalid stops - false
positives) increased throughput to the point that the Bombe became a major success (The National Museum
                                                                      MACHINES HACKING MACHINES - TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER] | 291

of Computing, n.d.). The addition of the digital board led Bletchley Park to break the first German Enigma
Machine code. Coined the Turing-Welchman Bombe machine, the digital board became a permanent part
of the build. By 1941, the codebreakers of Bletchley Park were understanding more of the code, a consistent
combination of letters could be traced back to German military units. This was groundbreaking, now the
codebreakers were able to understand the movement of the German Military, switching the allies' militaries to
offense verses defense.

   The United States partnered with the United Kingdom codebreakers at Bletchley Park with the approval
of Winston Churchill. The top secret "Sinkov Mission" team was led by former Brooklyn math teacher U.S.
Army Capitan Abraham Sinkov, expert in Italian cipher systems (Spyscape, 2023). Other team members were
U.S. cryptanalyst Leo Rosen, the Japanese cipher recreator (codename Purple); Navy Lieutenant Prescott
Currier specialized in radio intelligence collection involving the Japanese Navy; Navy Rear Admiral Robert H.
Weeks, experienced in communication security posts in Washington D.C. (Spyscape, 2023).

   Since the U.S. was not technically at war, the Sinkov team had limited access to Bletchley Park during
their visit. However, Leo Rosen worked closely with the Bletchley and engineers and noted improvements
for the Turing-Welchman Bombe machine. Rosen would later introduce electrical switches into the design
after returning to the U.S. (Spyscape, 2023). The U.S. and U.K. intelligence bond would strengthen after the
bombing of Pearl Harbor.
   It is estimated 159 quintillion different German encryption permutations (The Parallax View, 2018) were
read by the codebreakers of Bletchley Park (75% women), with some support of 100,000 U.S. Navy WAVES
(Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) codebreakers. On May 8, 1945, the Germany
surrendered, Churchill took part in the U.K. celebrations and warned that war was not over, Japan needed to
be defeated. After the U.S. deployment of the Atomic Bomb, Japan surrendered on August 15th, 1945.

ENIGMA: LESSONS LEARNED
The lessons learned of the WWII codebreakers can be applied to modern day operational security. German
enigma operator's mistakes played into the hands of the codebreakers at Bletchley Park. Human mistakes
were made of mundane routine combined with difficult bureaucratic processes. The enigma operators did
                                                                     MACHINES HACKING MACHINES - TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER] | 295

not understand why their role was important in the bigger picture of the war. Potentially if the operators
understood the mistakes in their job posed vulnerabilities and threats for the entire German military, the
operators would be aware they are mission critical. The same principle can be applied to the military leaders,
respecting and applying operator feedback regarding routine.

   The U.K. used the combination of intelligence and military to break codes, physically surround targets and
use Allies. Once a German code was deciphered there was no further protection leaving the German military's
plans in plain view. Additionally with the joining force of intelligence and military, the U.K. and allies were
able to attack German forces repeatedly without relief. Applying the lessons learned to modern day, clearly
multiple layers of encryption with strong security architecture can prevent an attacker from getting into the
"crown jewels."

   Overall, the ignoring of vulnerabilities from insider threat to not evaluating the strength of security in place,
can be detrimental. The lessons learned from WWII German ENIGMA contributed to cybersecurity theories
of modern day.

THE TURING TEST

In 1950 Alan Turing published, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in the quarterly philosophy and
analytic tradition journal, Mind. The paper introduced the concept of the "The Turing Test." The phrase
"The Turing Test" is most effectively used to refer to as a way of dealing with the question whether machines
can think (Stanford University, 2003). The Turing Test is considered the method of inquiry in artificial
intelligence (St. George & Gillis, 2023). Turing proposed the test as a game to gauge if a computer is mimicking
human intelligence under specific conditions. The test has one human judge that has a test conversation with
other unseen players. The judge evaluates the players responses, it the judge is unable to detect a computer
response, then the Turing Test is passed. Failure of the Turing Test would occur if the judge were able to pick
out a response from a computer (University of Manchester Department of Science and Engineering, 2022).
There are two groups of theory regarding the Turing Test, one believes it is obsolete another believes it is
relevant.

                                        Figure 6-9 Diagram of the Turing Test
296 | MACHINES HACKING MACHINES - TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER]

   Source: (St. George & Gillis, 2023)
   The obsolete proponents of the Turing Test use bot ELIZA as an example. The ELIZA bot used
psychotherapist tactics with the human. Some believe this passed the Turing Test other believe it was using
trickery and played on the naïve humans. In 1991, the Loebner Prize was created, named after its founder
and philanthropist Hugh Loebner, is an annual world-wide contest to evaluate the state-of-the-art in artificial
intelligence (AI) (University of Exeter, 2023). The Loebner Prize is supported by several universities and
organizations such as the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies and Bletchley Park. The Loebner Prize
has recognized winning contestant bots as passing Turing Test. By recognizing the winners of this contest, a
portion of the population believes the Turing Test is obsolete. Since the last Loebner Prize contest in 2019,
two implementations, Google's AI LaMDA and ChatGPT have been recognized (albeit controversially) as
having passed the Turing Test. (Mark,2023) (Orf, 2023) The replacement is the Marcus Test, a measure of
the computer's comprehension of a television show. Also, an additional replacement to the Turing Test is the
Lovelace Test 2.0. The Lovelace Test 2.0 measures the intelligence of the computer's ability to create an art
artifact. Mustafa Suleyman, who co-founded the AI Lab DeepMind which was acquired by Google, argues
                                                                     MACHINES HACKING MACHINES - TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER] | 297

that the ChatGPT's large language model approach allows it to pass the Turing Test by mimicking a human
yet it doesn't indicate any understanding about what the system can actually understand. He proposes a more
modern Turing test based on entrepreneurship, asking the A.I. to turn $100,000 in seed money into $1million
by devising an original product idea. (Shin, 2023)

   Source: (Cornell University, 2023)
   The other side of the population believes the Turing Test is relevant and has not been achieved as of today.
This population views the Turing Test as a concept testing machines response to human speech. To have a
conversation as humans do this would prove artificial intelligence. The argument is that Artificial Intelligence
does not exist today. Instead, there are machines that have a response to stimulus, kicking off the process
of the machine to perform an action. We know that computers can follow an algorithm to accomplish a
task. However, this does not prove the machine is thinking. The summer of 2022, Blake Lemoin, a Google
298 | MACHINES HACKING MACHINES - TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER]

engineer claimed Google had created a sentient machine. Lemoin believed the Language Model for Dialogue
Applications (LaMDA), system he has been working on as sentient, with a perception of, and ability to express,
thoughts and feelings that was equivalent to a human child (Reed, 2022). Google and many leading scientists
were quick to dismiss Lemoine's views as misguided, saying LaMDA is simply a complex algorithm designed to
generate convincing human language (Reed, 2022). Algorithms and ancillary items are too primitive to create
human intelligence (Roitblat, 2021).

   Could it be that we do not have artificial intelligence that can pass a Turing Test? The University Manchester
Professor Steve Furber states we have yet to see any convincing demonstration of a machine that can pass
his test (Furber, 2016). Professor Furber, believes we need to return to the natural intelligence, the human
brain to solve for Turing's concept of "thinking" (Furber, 2016). Professor Furber is currently building a
computer to support real-time models of the brain subsystems (Christopherson, 2022). Professor Furber
masterpiece, `Spiking Neural Network Architecture' known as SpiNNaker is the world's largest neuromorphic
supercomputer designed and built to work in the same way a human brain does has been recently fitted with
its landmark one-millionth processor core. With a price tag of £15million, 20 years in conception and over 10
years in construction starting 2006 (University of Manchester Department of Science and Engineering, 2022).
Project funding began with Engineering and the Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), currently
funding is coming from the European Human Brain Project.

   SpiNNaker is unique because, unlike traditional computers, it doesn't communicate by sending large
amounts of information from point A to B via a standard network. Instead, it mimics the massively parallel
communication architecture of the brain, sending billions of small amounts of information simultaneously to
thousands of different destinations (University of Manchester Department of Science and Engineering, 2022).
Professor Furber's ultimate goal for SpiNNaker's is understanding the information processing principles at
work in natural intelligence. SpiNNaker could satisfy Turing's concept of "Thinking" per Professor Furber
theory.
   The Turing Test does not recognize functional Intelligence in a computer. The revelation of simulated
intelligence by machine can be found using the Turing Test. The Turing Test can be said to reveal judgement
by humans who come to conclusions using feelings, intuition, and imperfect information. The Turing Test
will continue to be debated among scientists, programmers, and philosophers.

CONCLUSIONS
Alan Turing research was influential during his time, modern day, and in the future. His early research of
300 | MACHINES HACKING MACHINES - TURING'S LEGACY [CARTER]

mathematics and algorithms led to the creation and of different computer systems and a basis for developing
software. Turing remains popular in our minds for co-creating the Turing-Welchman Bombe machine leading
to the breaking of German ENGIMA encryption machines resulting in an early end of WW II. Turing's
life contributions have led to the development of theoretical computer science, the study of algorithms,
computational complexity, and formal models of computation. Turing was boundless with creative
mathematical concepts and theories. Alan Turing remains relevant today and for the development of artificial
intelligence and technology for the future.

MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES FOR MIXED
HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS [RYAN]

MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES FOR HUMAN-AI TEAMS

This chapter explores some of the challenges associated with managing teams of workers that include both
humans (modified or unmodified) and machines of various levels of intelligence (smart, intelligent, or special
purpose). Management is a complicated process that includes planning, resourcing, decision making,
oversight, and process measurement. Executing management responsibilities necessarily means acquiring,
organizing, training, and equipping the workers to do the job. In a world where humans and machines work
together in teams, which means that these processes need to address the needs of both humans and machines --
processes today that are done by separate groups of people with different training, skills, and job descriptions.
This chapter is designed to help you understand how to begin to think about these challenges and how they fit
into your life.

   Note: the use of the term `artificial intelligence' (AI) is problematic because of all the various definitions. In
this chapter, no specific definition is used since it is well discussed in the other chapters.

STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES

This is a philosophical exploration of a complicated topic. After reading this chapter, the student should
explore these ideas further, particularly through the lens of life experiences.

PROLOGUE

A friend posited recently that good managers spend most of their time coaching, rather than engaging in the
classical aspects of management (which include planning, resourcing, directing, measuring, and rewarding). In
fact, she went so far as to opine that excellent managers spend about 70% of their time coaching. I asked her in
response the following:

   I wonder if you have considered what the effect of increased "AI"-human teams (where I use the term AI very,
very loosely) might have on the role of the manager/coach? The emergence of a job that is (loosely) described as "AI
                                                  MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES FOR MIXED HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS [RYAN] | 303

prompting" might suggest that in these mixed teams, your formula will continue to be correct, albeit expressed in
different ways according to the target.

   Her answer was, "With sentience, sure. What do you think?"
   My reply:
   Sentience is an interesting but unsatisfying measure. For one thing it is only indirectly measurable (via
surrogate variables). But how do you detect if a thing is faking sentience? I think some mixture of sapience and
agency makes a difference. The agency aspect is particularly interesting with regards to this challenge.
   Sentience, as a concept, is problematic as a measure of, well, anything really. It merely means the ability to
perceive or feel things. Even plants can do that. How does that advance our understanding of future issues with
AIs? Sapience is only slightly better, as it implies a measure of wisdom. Wisdom itself is a difficult concept to
define, much less use.
   But if you elide sapience into intelligence and add agency to that, then you get a being that has some
level of intelligence that approaches wisdom and has the ability to act based on its own judgment. So this is
the focus of the challenge: a machine that is intelligent in one or more aspect and which has the
ability to decide if and how to act in any particular situation. This implies more than simply following
programmed logic: it implies the ability to collect data from the environment, use that data as input to a
decision-making analysis, and then independently decide if and how to act based on the results of the decision-
making analysis process.
   So, here's the thought: if you have two equally sapient individuals, each with agency, but one is human
and the other is not, how do you manage them as a team? This is where we find ourselves. And it is worth
considering how we manage today, how we will manage tomorrow, and how we should plan on managing in
the future, assuming that humans remain in the management position.
   The technology base of the modern economy is highly advanced in information processing and supporting
functions. The people who work in this economy need to be highly skilled in order to use and work with
intelligent machines. To date, these two components -- technology and people -- have been managed through
separate systems. Until recently, that separation made good sense: people are different than machines and have
different needs. However, there are emerging technology trends that suggest it is time to rethink this separation.
As human performance is more tightly coupled with machines, including those classed as "artificially
intelligent," the approach to management needs to change. Human Resources (HR) and Machine Resources
(MR) combine to create the modern workforce. Machines that collaborate with humans cannot be managed
without taking the humans into account; concomitantly, humans that are tightly coupled with machines
cannot be managed without taking the machines into account.
   One of the interesting aspects of the thought exercise is considering how focused many managers are in
removing or limiting the agency of human employees. Various human resources management techniques
have been developed over time to reduce the ability of workers to act with a full, independent agency. These
techniques include use of devices such as non-compete clauses, claw-back options for earned commissions, and
304 | MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES FOR MIXED HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS [RYAN]

psychological approaches to creating "firm as family" emotional ties. As a result, one of the potential futures
that must be considered is a future where the machine has more agency than the human.

   The purpose of this chapter is to explore that future specifically through the lens of management. You could
just as easily change the lens to that of talent supply chain, innovation, or any other organizational issue. In
fact, do so. It will enlarge your appreciation of the challenges ahead.

THE ROLES OF MACHINES AND HUMANS

Humans have always used technology. The first technologies were tools, clothing, and symbols. As new
technologies were invented, merged with other technologies, and improved, the dependence that humans have
on technology has grown significantly. We live in artificial caves that come with artificial sunlight and artificial
heat. We cook on artificial campfires, clothe ourselves in artificial skins and cloth, and communicate using
artificial noise. In truth, it would be difficult for a normal person to survive if plucked out of this cocoon of
technological comfort and ease that we have created.

   The most recent advancements of technology assistance to human endeavors have relieved humans of the
types of work that humans do not perform well or consistently. This includes repetitious mindless activities,
such as factory work, and large data set analyses. As humans have off-loaded these types of tasks onto machines,
humans have been freed to focus on things that machines cannot do or do poorly. However, even as humans
work in areas that machines are not (currently) good for, the execution of these types of activities relies in great
part on technological support. And as tools like ChatGPT continue to make inroads into the workplace, the
role of "technological support" becomes more closely coupled with human efforts.

   In great nation competition, technology has been adapted and invented to protect humans from harm, both
in offensive operations and in defense. Unmanned systems are paired with human controllers and weapon
system operators. Intelligent targeting systems guide bombs to targets. AI assistants suggest and make decisions
in ways that may be fully obscured from human understanding. The idea of "human in the loop" is being
replaced by "human over the loop," with the human taking on more of a role of coach or customer rather than
participant.

   The integration of technology into human existence has not been limited to performing tasks and serving
as distancing mechanisms. It also includes integration into the human body for performance monitoring,
maintenance, and adjustment. As noted in a 2012 study by the National Academy of Sciences, "Advances in
medicine, biology, electronics, and computation have enabled an increasingly sophisticated ability to modify
the human body." The study pointed to three general areas of technology innovation regarding the human
body: "human cognitive modification as a computational problem, human performance modification as a
biological problem, and human performance modification as a function of the brain-computer interface."[1]
                                                  MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES FOR MIXED HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS [RYAN] | 305

THE NEED FOR COMBINED TALENT MANAGEMENT

In reality, combined talent management is already here, albeit in nascent form. Machines manage humans in
all sorts of interesting ways, and machines are managed by humans. The various talents of human workers are
judged and sorted by machines, while the various abilities of machines are integrated into workplaces according
to need and potential to contribute.

   During recent research into human talent management systems, a study group[2] discovered very interesting
evidence of the integration of advanced technology into the process of managing humans. These integrated
processes included the decisions associated with selection, assessing, and training the humans, sometimes to
the extent of it not being clear how the humans would actually operate without the technology. In other
words, the machines were managing the humans, at least to some level. This suggests the potential of a future
of human resource management that is more tightly coupled with machine management than we might be
anticipating.

   The adoption and integration of advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence, into the post-industrial
economy, education, and governance structures have advanced the leveraging of knowledge to make processes
more efficient and more effective. The field of knowledge management has attempted to capture the challenges
of collecting, curating, and spreading both implicit and explicit knowledge within these environments, with
some success. However, as the integration of knowledge, both as multipliers and as external replications of
human intelligence, surges forward, there must be a concomitant recognition that organizations must deal
with a supply chain of human intelligence -- the brain power that humans bring to the working environment.
The supply chain of human intelligence includes both the acquisition and value adding of intelligence in
humans (hiring, training, and educating) as well as the integration of human intelligence into machines. Writ
broadly, this describes a supply chain of intelligence that integrates the human and the machine. The supply
chain approach can enable enterprises to value each contribution to the value-added prospect of the enterprise,
enabling enterprises to account for investments correctly and adequately in the human intelligence supply
chain.

   It's not just the cognitive processes of humans that are subject to supply chain like activities. The entirety of
human and extra-human intelligence, either encapsulated in a human or as captured in a computer program,
needs to be considered together. Humans use automation to outsource elements of intelligent activity.
Alternatively phrased, humans extend their brain activity interaction with the rest of the world (other people,
tools, places, etc.) by expanding their physical presence through the use of technology such as decision aids, AI,
and other assistive technologies.

   It is unlikely that the integration of human and technology components will cease, slow down, or reverse
itself. In fact, we have seen direct evidence to the contrary, particularly as we have sheltered in place during the
COVID-19 pandemic for an extended period of time, each of us learning new ways of collaborating with each
other and socializing with each other. The future envisioned in The Caves of Steel[3] may be just around the
corner.
306 | MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES FOR MIXED HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS [RYAN]

   Exploring the emerging issue of human-machine teams requires not just the investigation of human-
machine teaming but also the supply chain of both artificial and organic intelligence. So, there are several
management issues to consider. These include, but are not limited to:

  · The behavioral and cognitive effects of human-machine teaming
  · Issues of trust between humans and machine teammates
  · Synchronization of the human and machine talent development and management systems
  · The security of the "intelligence" supply chain

MANAGEMENT OF AI-HUMAN TEAMS

When most people think of AI-Human teams, they reflexively think about data scientists or other high-tech
people working with and developing AIs. A much more interesting team composition to consider is the
`normal' person teamed with one or more commercial production AIs.

   Consider, however, examples of more ordinary work teams: that of a janitor, a lab technician, a kindergarten
teacher, or a construction worker, each teamed with AI to accomplish their respective jobs. Each of those
workers has specialty knowledge related to their jobs and presumably the AI will to. How will they `talk' to each
other? How will they coordinate? It is a manager's job to make sure the working environment is appropriate to
the needs of the worker (including disability issues).

   A manager plans, resources, oversees, and measures the progress and success of work efforts. In order to
successfully manage the human AI team, the manager (which may in fact be another AI) must take into
accounts the differing needs of each member of the team. The manager hires (acquires) the talent needed,
ensures each team member knows what they need to know to accomplish the job, provides the needed
resources, makes the schedules, and assigns the activities. The manager also measures work performance,
provides guidance on how each worker is performing, and integrates work output with other elements of the
overall enterprise. It is challenging enough to do this well with only humans and dumb but critically important
machines (like word processors, earth penetrating radar, or mass spectrometers). Adding what could be viewed
as an alien being into that mix of personalities and technologies is very likely to result in novel challenges that
are unpredictable right now.

BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE ISSUES

One existing challenge associated with managing teams is observing, evaluating, and managing behavioral
aspects of team relationships. We have names for different behaviors because these behaviors occur often
enough to warrant consideration. Bullies, prima donnas, manipulators, shirkers, toadies, and more: each can
                                                   MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES FOR MIXED HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS [RYAN] | 307

cause challenges in team management. If left unmanaged, each can contribute towards the development of a
toxic working environment.

   What types of behaviors are likely to arise from the integration of sapient machines with agency? Will there
be jealousies, attempts to sabotage the work of the AI, or other behavioral challenges with the human members
of the team? Conversely, will the AI subvert the efforts of the humans?

   Understanding that these need to be considered and watched for in the process of creating a true human-AI
team is a critical first step to addressing potential problems.

ISSUES OF TRUST

Trust is a critical component of team efforts, particularly in work efforts that require a high degree of precision.
When trust is lost between team members, the overall performance of the team suffers, sometimes to the point
of becoming dysfunctional.

   What does a human do if they lose trust in a machine they are working with right now? The answer
is normally to try to fix it -- go through trouble-shooting procedures, consult the tech manuals, ask the
help desk, or reboot the machine. What will a human do in the future if the human loses trust in the AI
teammate? It is entirely possible that AIs will be too complicated to trouble-shoot outside of an "AI hospital"
and rebooting could do more harm than good.

   What will an AI do if it loses trust in its human teammate? You can't reboot a human, at least not today.
Will the AI simply cease working with the human? Will the AI create an environment where the human can't
successfully participate in the work processes? Will the AI damage the human in order to get it removed from
the work environment? When trust is lost, it is normally for good reasons and the AI might feel like there is
no option but to act in order to limit the ability of the untrusted (and untrustworthy) team member from
working.

   The issue of trust between team members then becomes a critical focus for managers of mixed AI-human
teams. This issue becomes particularly acute when the loss of trust occurs during a fast-paced precision work
situation. Consider an AI-human team operating on a human to remove a brain tumor. The loss of trust, by
one member or the other, during that operation would be a potentially catastrophic problem.

THE TALENT SUPPLY CHAIN

Assuming a future where human intelligence is a desired attribute in the work environment, any Worker
Resource (WR) system must consider the differences in the development of the various intelligences. For
example, humans develop slowly; machines can be developed much more quickly. The needs of the work
environment must be able to synchronize the time development schedules of both humans and machines in
308 | MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES FOR MIXED HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS [RYAN]

a way that optimizes the utility of each. The strategic planning issues associated with this synchronization are
staggering, given the speed at which technology, and needed future human education can change.

   Additionally, there are inherent security aspects of the human talent supply chain, even though it is not
fool proof. The humans developed undergo years of training and education, during which they are observable
and can be assessed for trustworthiness and competency. These same aspects are not inherently part of the
machine intelligence supply chain, although they could be. The integration of parts manufactured in many
different parts of the world, combined to create a body in which an AI can reside, creates a universe of supply
chain issues associated with the trustworthiness of parts -- both as individual components and as elements of
systems.

FINAL THOUGHTS

As the previous chapters in this book have demonstrated, we are headed into a future that will provide many
challenges. Thinking about how humans fit into that future is an important task. Research, obviously, is
needed. Another thing that is needed is a profound sense of caution. Embracing the promise of technology is
critically important but it must be done with clear-eyed testing, analysis, and adaptation of the technology to
ordinary human existence. With such an approach, the stars become ours to conquer.

PURVIEW

Images of a future world where humans are engaged in lifelong phony IOT/AI enabled fantasy universe are
frenetically engaged in a competitive long-term struggle with those choosing to dwell in reality for dominance.
Reality is one thing, but AI enabled escapism is quite another. Youth have collectively signaled their preferences
and fantasy seems likely to edge out extended excursions into reality wherein pain, setback, humiliation, and
loss are prevalent. Regrettably, many under the age of 25 want that fantasy right now and cannot wait any
longer for it to happen. Collegiate diversions to contemplate life's hidden meanings and study enduring global
mysteries hold no power over those who cherish entertainment over education.

   Capturing the attention and focus of younger people is no longer reserved for the decade after 2030. Today
calibrating an illusory threat, we neither comprehend nor display adequate expertise to decipher allows the
cyber experts to engineer a future we may not want to inhabit. Instead, it beckons to those who shun the
random, sometimes bizarre and whimsical episodes which daily life offers. When quantum, AI and IOT
[internet of things] combine in deliberate convergent ways for explicit entertainment infused among the
masses who can resist or overcome its undeniable appeal. The rest of us opting out of cyber fantasyland cannot
forecast what good things, perverse things and some very bad things might result. Those embarking on the
risk of consuming unlimited unrestricted cyber entertainment must absorb the consequences. What warning
flags or cautionary advice would dissuade those already smitten with cyber based fantasy? Can we foresee the
engineered convergence of multiple technologies yielding anything but productive and beneficial outcomes?
How about blending in nanotech, genomics, electromagnetics, and other technological dynamics? Should the
experts pause to consider the impact or implications? What happens then? Will the net result be a better world
or one where what Mankind has created via its unending curiosity an environment that eventually swallows
us all up? How will our minds be affected?

THE TAUTOLOGY OF TRUSTING IN TECHNOLOGY

What does the human constantly yearn for and what steps will humans undertake to achieve that? If we are
truly on a path to a better more fulfilling life versus the apocalypse, then what is the best road to be chosen?
Will the current trajectory of human aspiration, global society and civilization continue as in the past or divert
in a new direction? Many will put their trust in technology as a rational and objective basis for answering these
questions. They will do so without very much hesitation.

   Some will prefer to continue the present uneven and fate-filled course. Holding technology at arm's length
attracts those doubtful the full array of expected and unexpected outcomes will be salutary. Others will reject
that out of hand. Only a full embrace of all technology offers makes sense to them. Fearlessly the pursuit and
support of unrestricted technology--convergent or not--is the antidote to stagnation.

   Life itself needs a reboot and refocus that only objective unlimited application and investment in every
aspect of technology can offer. For many this is the preferred path. Is there any doubt? Technology provides
the answer to a multitude of global ills, doesn't it? Technology unchained and supported continually by
visionary leadership can bring about a level of global achievement, efficiency, stability, and relative security
unencumbered by managers, politicians, and professors whose inherent fleshly capabilities are limited. The
future and its essential socio-technical architecture is a comfortable alternative to swallowing more of the same.
It allows one to jettison the past and all the trappings of unimaginative energy which hold back human destiny.

   Without too much thought we routinely invest confidence and trust in modern technology. We find
ourselves comfortably minimizing any latent uncertainty when we board a jetliner or travel overseas by
merchant ship trusting all will go well and safely. We abide by the assurances and confidence which positive
experiences with technology have thus far conveyed. Technology itself is the pathway to a better future for all.
Isn't it? It harbors good things--not woeful things--correct? We have benefitted so richly from technology
over the years can its rare and periodic setbacks ever nullify its frequent successes. If technology is king who
then are its servants?

   We govern what technology achieves in our name and faithfully executes the tasks given to it. As such
technology is our handmaiden and workhorse obedient and tireless like the horse pulling a plow or a
yachtsman steering his ship. We remain unsure whether that will always be the case and we harbor some serious
doubt about whether our love affair with technology will end well or badly. Bent to our will and governed by
well-educated and visionary brainiacs we expect technology to take us places we could never go to or experience
without it. It is a clever and deceptive bargain in any case.

   Technologies we hardly imagined 50 years ago such as cell phones, hypersonics, advanced genomics,
quantum computers and vehicles for transiting space are prevalent and ubiquitous. The human brain has
launched and nurtured these ideas and infused these technologies in ways that cause one to ponder if the brain
itself is truly without limits. We must always balance the good with the bad, the expected with the unexpected,
the known with the unknown. Recognizing we can hardly see the actual end of all things that today we
can only dimly grasp should enable us to admit we wander into speculation. One might consider whether
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                          METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 311

inquiries which push modern technologies into operational realms never merit a detached perspective. In effect
we should insert caution--however frequently we do not. Far from being a wildly unpredictable jungle full
of predators and risks embedded in nature, the decision to pursue and engage technology aggressively raises
few caution flags. With applied genius, scientific rigor and professional dedication, experimental innovative
excursions into modern technology are seen as manageable as controlling a drone with a joystick. In episodes
like this we routinely trust the experts to know what they are doing.

   Risks are inherently embedded in discovery and outcomes include both the known and unexpected. When
scientists tinker with technology the rest of us have to invest some trust in their innovative theory--up to a
point. After all whatever could go wrong is keenly understood within the limitless ambit of pristine human
logic. Risk is always there but not to a degree that thwarts scientific inquiry and experimentation. Esteemed
scientists have encountered these risks and pitfalls many times. This does compel serious thought about
ramping up confidence , paring down uncertainty and expanding the art of the possible. Our brains, cognition
and normal everyday neural functions are indeed spectacular and impressive. Is there a dark side that seldom
gets attention? Is there a hidden dimension ignored? Is it reasonable to ask whether our brains and ordinary
cognition are at risk? What are the boundaries of neuro-resilience? What threats our brains and cognition must
be taken seriously? Are we asking the right questions?

   We must reckon with the frontier into which technology invades a very personal space. Here we witness
technology at work assisting 0r alleviating persons with emotional or mental health issues and those with
traumatic brain injury. The MRI and the MeRT [Magnetic Resonance Therapy] used by neuroscientists offers
a benign and helpful pathway to reduce mental stress and reductions in chronic brain problems. Here the
admirable skills of public health aim to heal and restore people suffering a variety of mental health woes. It can
readily be extolled as marvelous and conferring verifiable relief on those afflicted. Neuroscience remedies are
wonderful things.

   Our brains are also wonderful things, but they lack sustained defenses against external nefarious efforts
to degrade and distort ordinary thought and cognition. To imagine a hostile nation that would subvert and
redirect certain technologies to disrupt and destabilize the brain sounds ludicrous and offensive. We must note
carefully and diligently that the threat emanating from this activity is genuine.

   Targeting healthy brains to disrupt, impair, destabilize, and degrade their innate functions using stealthy
technology sounds like Sci-Fi but it is not. We possess admirable cognitive instincts against danger, but our
brains stop short of being alerted instinctively to every conceivable pitfall, calamity, and risk. There are biases
and perspectives which inhabit our mind as much as creative and helpful thoughts often do. Trying to picture
our brain as a target and an objective to be conquered, neutralized, and crippled by a determined clandestine
foe seems alien. However, these days our attention should shift quickly to this provocative idea. It is happening
to many people and has been verified as a confirmable neuroscience assault incident. Those adversely affected
for years have stepped forward to claim harm and seek relief knowing a shroud of serious doubt and derision
is often levied at them. These randomized attacks on human cognition and brain function are significant and
have adversely affected thousands. Evidence abounds regrettably that this is happening all around us.

METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

GRASPING THE ERA OF NEUROSTRIKE

When US diplomats first reported suspicious and bizarre brain maladies in the 2016-2018 period arising from
their posting to Havana it was embraced by the media with a mixture of acceptance, doubt, and denigration.
Numerous studies and reports on these incidents can be found which reflect a widening series of attacks
on diplomats, US military personnel, intelligence community staff and those assigned to work in selected
embassies on trade, commerce, or energy issues. (National Academies, 2020) It is far less illuminating to know
the actual number of verified victims than to ponder what technology could be causing this series of cognitive
impairment events which I have termed NeuroStrike. (McCreight, Neuro-Cognitive Warfare: Inflicting
Strategic Impact via Non-Kinetic Threat, 2022)

   Media and armchair experts have launched their theories rooted in doubt and denigration where various
explanations for the victim's cognitive injuries have ranged from crickets to hallucinations, to emotional
distress, to job pressures to indirect exposure to Zika virus environmental spraying. All of these analyses are
rooted in nonfactual analysis and faulty conclusions. While the actual number of victims, even continuing
today, is less important than the fact that such insidious attacks persist at all without robust detection,
defense, deterrence, and defeat measures we cannot fail to see the implications of NeuroStrike technology
and sophisticated cognitive warfare dominating the decades ahead. Convergent technology will continue at
a pace which far exceeds our ability to understand or manage it. (McCreight & Sincavage, The Significance
of Convergent Technology Threats to Geospatial Intelligence, 2019) Biochemical, neuroscience, electronic
warfare, RF biophysical effects, acoustic biophysical effects, nanoparticles, and magnetic factors are blended in
a debilitating convergent technology which signifies the complex NeuroStrike threat. It enables the owner of
NeuroStrike to derive the quintessential leverage which ancient Chinese sage Sun Tzu observed allows one to
win a war `without firing a shot.'

   Thinking about how silent, covert, and insidious neuro-modulators can impair cognitive functions, damage
analysis, and decimate ordinary reasoning along with speech, memory and spatial orientation is likewise
relegated to a time cloaked in distant science fiction. We know otherwise. Not because we subscribe to
conspiracy theory or allow ourselves to depict a dark and dystopian future rooted in abject cynicism or submit
to hallucinogenic drugs. Instead, we know history has demonstrated humanity has a deeps seated lust and
enduring appetite for technology that fascinates, entertains, amuses, and simplifies life's problems. So, it is with
innovative technology, complexity convergent technology, and technology that alters our sense of what is real
and unreal. For many, the virtual world has more net appeal than the real one and those talented geniuses in
our midst are driven to acquire it as soon as feasible.

   Is this a recipe for madness? Or is it a world instead where machines, computers and AI technology do
our bidding, attaining quantum insights and secures advances in social and economic wellbeing we long for
perpetually? Our innate fascination with the seductive value of technology and what it potentially offers can
hardly be dismissed. Worse, we lack wisdom not only in gauging the known risks we face but grappling with
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                          METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 313

the myriad unknown risks attached to any future convergent technology engineering venture. This absence of
wisdom accrues to experts and scientists alike.

   Intuitively we are accustomed to reliance on egghead experts. In fact, in some cases, we carelessly delegate
the task of making complex decisions to further societal progress towards scientific elites. This most frequently
happens because we lack proper estimates of the design, operational structure, and dynamics of the venture
they are sponsoring. Do we also unwittingly assume the downstream risk and unforeseen consequences which
produce potential negative outcomes for society have been assessed and homogenized to our benefit? Are we
truly aware and cognizant of the persistent problems quantum computers and AI can resolve--or regrettably
and inadvertently generate? If anything, enhancing NeuroStrike scope and effectiveness via quantum AI, and
unlimited IOT involves risks we can hardly envision let alone regulate. Yet here we sit keenly aware of the
beast at our doorstep but entranced and distracted by TV, entertainment, and vapid expressions of cultural
awareness masquerading as education.

   We can hardly be blamed for wanting to harness technology which improves life for all, creates abundance,
economic security, improved health, upgraded quality of life and still manages to solve mankind's most acute
problem while we sit back and watch movies or request another beverage. However, there is always the
inevitably unexpected spate of outcomes which can be brutally damaging and then it is often accompanied
by unseen or hardly anticipated costs and societal consequences. Not to worry you say. Just like TV, jetliners,
computers, and plastic surgery the initial fears and skepticism are overblown and display a haphazard disregard
for the promise of technology as savior.

   However, if our doubts, concerns, and risk awareness are justifiable we find ourselves once again reliant on
the closed shop cabal of scientists who are extremely happy to be entrusted to navigate and accelerate our
collective societal wellbeing. Too often this scientific mafia of experts decides what is `good' for all people based
on their superior intellect. Supported and funded by their retinue of endorsers and policymakers who ramrod
their presumptive expertise and technological preferences into massively consequential decisions affecting the
unwashed masses. The naively trusting public must always endure the immediate and long-term consequences
of scientific largesse absorbing the best and unseen worst of their ideas and technological ventures.

   Quite simply and predictably we trust these big decisions to those experts who have earned our collective
trust and civic confidence. We imagine that like a jetliner rolling down the runway at takeoff speed the entire
flight will be smooth, safe, and pleasurable. It is akin to the unstated confidence we invest in medical doctors to
know what they are doing, conduct proper diagnoses and find the prescription for better health. The degree of
automatic trust involved is overwhelming. In like manner we have invested similar levels of trust in science and
technology for their salutary effects. But is that a foolish default position for society to adopt so unthinkingly?
A trusting public unaware of risk and potentially negative outcomes remains comfortable with the view science
and technology is the pathway to a better life. Is it flawed to think that experts trust science, worship technology
and are energetically committed to achieving all that focused brainpower and technology can accomplish? Not
necessarily but it could be so.

   All our flawed thinking, blind ignorance and error prone behavior is steered faultlessly toward ever more
314 | NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

perfect and optimal outcomes because we seek it so urgently. If the pathway to a better future resides in
the convergent mix of IOT, AI, quantum, and the promises of nanotech, ChatGPT and the metaverse why
would anyone aim to thwart that? As a result, we have placed our support behind mixing these technologies in
explicitly convergent strategies to attain a better future. (Ortiz, 2023) In effect, we openly create an electronic
gateway to a more ideal, tranquil, stable, and secure future where that formula is attractive. Many see this as a
calculated gamble which nullifies the annoying diversions, errors, blind spots, and costly surprises which have
historically plagued human thought. In effect this sophisticated convergent technology venture is well worth
the risk--assuming we truly grasp the risks involved. Isn't that the pathway and outcome modern society and
organized great nations ought to pursue with robust enthusiasm and confidence? Why should anyone raise
concerns or pose cautions when engineering advanced convergent technology itself is the difference between
progress and maintaining the deceptive array of gadgets we know as normal?

NEUROSTRIKE--CONSIDERING ITS CYBER DIMENSIONS IOT/CHATGPT

The immediate future in modern society is one transfixed and endlessly entertained by quantum, IOT, cyber
leverage and the introduction of ChatGPT unveiled in November 2022. Expectant society welcomes all the
beneficial changes and revolutionary outcomes which these technologies offer to society dimly aware that
hidden and ambiguous risks are blended with -but dwarfed--by images of limitless progress. Can a hopeful
society be blamed for such enthusiasm? Technological breakthroughs and skillfully mixing emerging complex
and hybrid technologies earn a welcome from the general public because it contains the promise of a simplified
and enhanced ordinary life.

   The internet of things [IOT] dwells harmlessly in our midst and operates magically in human space as
a means of communication--so we think. However, the standard cell phone is always searching for and
receiving signals which it finds useful or which it has relied on many times before. Those thousands of signals
drifting and bouncing among people in a crowded shopping mall stores, relays and searches other signals in
that mishmash environment which the phone itself is designed to identify and connect with apart from any
decision the user or owner may have. Our reliance on cell phones and the amazing IOT network behind them
connecting us to devices anywhere in the world via satellite or other means purely out of sight and mind.
However, we must remember our brains are truly hardwired to display sensitivity and a degree of receptivity
to electromagnetic activities around us whether we are cognizant and aware or not. It raises the intriguing
question of whether cellphones can be instruments of passive mind influence and cognitive control. A question
best left as speculative--for now.

   Cyber, IOT, quantum and ChatGPT are truly fascinating and laden with extraordinary promise. By
themselves they offer grand visions of a better life for many. Caution is justified as the realities of unrestricted
technology convergence is not well understood. Justifiable confidence in engineered convergence is the
fundamental root of wide civic faith in what advanced technology might produce. However, where many
advanced areas of scientific inquiry such as genomics, nanotech, biotech, cyber mechanics, geomagnetic
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                          METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 315

systems, and electronics are explicitly merged and engineered via deliberate convergence is fraught with risk
and uncertainty. In exchange for every conceivable outcome that is valuable and beneficial there is a hidden,
unexpected, and ambiguous array of risks. Worse, our collective ability to estimate and foresee all adverse
and dangerous outcomes from technology convergence is opaque and often delusional. This is the central
dilemma and evokes a security nightmare which is embedded in a headlong race to engineer convergence of
IOT, quantum and ChatGPT.[Generative Pretrained Transformer] (BROWNE, 2023)

   It is simply because all possible, unexpected, secondary, and downstream adverse consequences of such
deliberate engineering symbolize a level of trust which society can ill afford. Traditional reliance on science
and technology experts to overcome these shortfalls and hidden risks displays a level of misplaced confidence
which is dangerous. This is especially troublesome as our enemies, rivals and foes have no compunction
about engaging in this odyssey of convergent engineering because they seek to secure an invincible strategic
advantage.

   The explicit convergence of these technologies contains zero risks according to some critics who see benign
text-based regurgitation of massive databases, an inability to persuade, influence, reason or imagine in complex
cognitive operations equivalent to the human brain. Just blending these innovative technologies includes a
manageable set of risks they say where a system defaults to a trove of stored data and facts. However, the
threat involved is clearly insidious. This makes the issue more complex as those regimes which threaten our
future security will pursue insidious convergent engineering to leverage their strategic projection and power.
We understand the explicit blend of IOT, cyber, AI and ChatGPT contains these risks

   -there are no operational, legal, or ethical boundaries [no moral corpus]
   -it does not yet acquire self-aware capabilities but eventually could do so
   -can potentially acquire competitive analysis and critical thinking
   -it is potentially capable of blended deep fake misdirected phony communication
   -it retains the capacity to generate deceptive, fraudulent, and incorrect decisions
   -it can misguide and misdirect decisionmakers who rely upon it
   -it is not impervious to external hacking and anonymous external control
   In effect, the engineered blend of IOT, cyber, AI and ChatGPT fails to convey to its human overseers the
inherent capacity to transparently view the good, bad, and ugly of its internal operations, focused queries,
and generative outcomes. Building safeguards or kill switches into the convergently engineered mix of these
technologies does not appear to be under consideration. But it should be. The merger and explicit convergent
engineering of ChatGPT, quantum, IOT and cyber over the next few years contains risks and unseen
consequences which even the experts cannot fathom.
   In 2014, Elon Musk called AI humanity's biggest existential threat and compared it to demonizing
the devil, "One of the biggest risks to the future of civilization is AI," Musk told attendees at the 2023
World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, shortly after mentioning the development of
ChatGPT. "It's both positive or negative and has great, great promise, great capability," Musk said. But he
stressed that "with that comes great danger." More recently he mentioned at that summit that we lack skilled
316 | NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

and sophisticated appreciation for its hidden risks--not just its attractive benefits. Elon Musk, who co-founded
firm behind ChatGPT, warns A.I. is `one of the biggest risks' to civilization (Browne, 2023)

   Merged elements of ChatGPT, IOT, cyber, and other convergent technologies is not only happening now
but will continue to happen in the unrestricted wild west wide open space that nurtures creativity, innovation,
and free thinking. Nations oblivious to ethical constraints and mindful of its strategic leverage will seek to
expand and invest in these dangerous convergent mixes. Worse, terrorists, criminal enterprises and proxy
guerilla warfare states can expect to acquire this capability--or rent it--for their own nefarious purposes.
Laid back society snoozing comfortably amidst NETFLIX, Grubhub, endless video games, fitness activities,
mindless Grammy infused music tsunamis and Tik Tok will never see it coming. It is here already. But the
dazed confused clueless will likely remain entranced and unfocused mired in staggering narcissism consuming
hours of their own entertainment as US national security is exchanged for escapist relaxation.

   Collaboration among like-minded criminal experts will also open the doorway to installing nanotech issues
and stealthy neurotoxins where it is most beneficial to them. If you imagined cocaine and fentanyl was
poisoning youth just picture a generation turned into Tim Tok zombies unable to sense when their wellbeing
and security is in jeopardy. Will the West truly awaken from a woke stupor in time? What about our enemies,
foes, and rivals? What leveraged opportunities exist for the bad guys to redirect these technologies against us?
What conceivable countermeasures will limit their work?

   The essential warning derives from a fundamental awareness of how our bodies, brains and internal systems
respond to electromagnetic waves, signals, and influences. Gateways to crafty external human exploitation
and nefarious misdirection within the brain and its cognitive subsystems starts with a keen awareness of how
electromagnetic phenomena interact with our brains and nervous systems. We know that transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) is a technique used to induce a short-term interruption of normal activity in a restricted
area of the brain caused primarily via rapid changes using a strong magnetic field near the focus of treatment
activity. Modern technology, including nonionizing radiation from power lines, wireless devices, cell phone
towers is ubiquitous in our society and unavoidable. Along with that are risks arising from extremely low
frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) which routinely surround home appliances as well as high-voltage
electrical transmission lines and transformers. Evidence of adverse health effects from EMF, including its
controversial influence on the brain, ranges from studiously inconclusive to menacingly harmful. Few experts
today wish to conclusively state that continuous EMF exposure is a genuine health hazard. However, we do
know that exposure to elevated levels of non-ionizing energy, such as at radio wave frequencies, can potentially
damage the structure and function of the nervous system. In some ways the perverse politics of environmental
science mitigates a deeper dive into human health implications as the sacred agenda of those who express alarm
versus those arguing for benign effects cannot readily agree. (Staff, 2017)

   Hence there is ample room for caution when considering the next neurological effects of electromagnetic
factors and technologies on human brains. Does that issue stop the application, research and innovation
of such technology given this caution? Not really. We are left to isolate and study what the net impact of
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                          METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 317

electromagnetic technologies may be in both immediate, long term and their latent effects. (WHO -Staff,
2016) (Zwoinska & al., 2015) (N.J.Cherry, 2003) (Tennenhouse, 2018)

DEALING WITH THE COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC
GATEWAY

Humans are distinctly composed biophysically and biochemically as repositories for electromagnetic activity
and the record of human sensitivity to, and influence by, electromatic factors is beyond debate. There is little
if any debate about the nature of human sensitivity to and reaction to electromagnetic fields [EMF]. The
intensity of electromagnetic radiation in the human environment emanating from these fields- which are
ubiquitous and normally found in developed areas--are both significant plentiful in human health terms.
Normal EMF impact on living organisms derives from its direct tissue penetration. More specifically, the
nature of our brains as a biological organ automatically includes a degree of electromagnetic sensitivity and
responsiveness to EMF. Scientific theory and research into human intelligence notes that in order to retain
intelligent thinking and sustain cognitive systems there needs to be a constant, globally available,
synchronization system that continuously stabilizes the brain. Here the significance is found in the
electromagnetic signaling system, supported by a biochemical system. EMF exerts both a thermal and
nonthermal effect on brain tissue and its effects on other parts of the body [nervous system, endocrine system,
visual system, cardiovascular and immune systems] are well established. More specifically EMF radiation is
reported to affect the central nervous system, brain chemistry and histology, and the blood-brain barrier.
We also understand limited medical applications of EMF for treatment and diagnostic purposes found in
the electroencephalograms (EEGs) and MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] used to treat neural disorders
are commonplace. Repurposing and re-engineering these technologies for harmful, disruptive, and damaging
effects is just as real.

   Effects of pulsed and sinusoidal ELF fields on the electrical activity of the nervous system have also been
studied extensively. While only high-intensity sinusoidal electric fields or rapidly pulsed magnetic fields induce
sufficient current density in tissue to alter neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission or to produce
neuromuscular stimulation their net effects at verified intensities are beyond dispute. When a person focuses
attention or tries to remember something this activity fires thousands of neurons simultaneously at the same
frequency generating a wave -- but at a rate closer to 10 to 100 cycles per second. Along with the brain the
heart is the largest and most potent electromagnetic field inside the body exceeding brain electromagnetic
sensitivity by 60 times.

   It is well known that weak EMF could cause all sorts of dramatic non-thermal effects in body cells, tissues,
and organs. The observed symptoms are hardly to assign to other environmental factors occurring
simultaneously in the human environment. Although, there are still ongoing discussions on non-thermal
effects of EMF influence, (WHO) has classified radio electromagnetic fields as potentially carcinogenic.
Electromagnetic fields can be dangerous not only because of the risk of cancer, but also other health problems,
318 | NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

including electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is a phenomenon
characterized by the appearance of symptoms after exposure of people to electromagnetic fields, generated
by EHS is characterized as a syndrome with a broad spectrum of non-specific multiple organ symptoms
including both acute and chronic inflammatory processes located in the skin and nervous systems, as well as in
respiratory, cardiovascular systems, and musculoskeletal system.

   When nanotech aspects are added to EMF influences available research shows high risks of ambient
neurotoxicity exists not only from nanotech in foods, the environment and within medical treatments such as
vaccines. This is not claiming a deliberate and perverse conspiracy to poison people and render then silent bio-
transducers of external ELF signals. Instead, this is simply to draw attention to the ramped-up risk for human
health based on the presence of nanoparticles in various aspects of our normal lives dwelling covertly there
largely without our knowledge or consent. So, ELF by itself generates many legitimate human health questions
but when paired with the existence of nanoparticles in the environment, our bodies, and our food we may
want to pause and consider its impact and ramifications on cognitive degradation issues, brain biochemistry
and the overall degree to which our DNA has been altered in ways that fundamentally change our humanity.
We know painfully well that anxiety, depression, and even self-harm can be linked to youth saturation with
social media technology. Again, this is not aimed to condemn nanotech but to shed light on its prevalence in
our society, ordinary social media, and diet in order to highlight the studies which underscore human health
risks and suggest we need to know more about its borderline toxicity. In effect, our collective combined trust
juxtaposed with our ignorance of nanotech complicates a rational analysis of its insidious contributing impact.
(WHO - Staff, 2017)

   Part of the electronic gateway facilitating NeuroStrike is the obvious nexus between cyber, AI, quantum
and space platforms which send, receive, and resonate electronic signals enabling long distance transmission of
allegedly benign but potentially harmful RF and electromagnetic energy which has the capacity to injure or
impair cognitive functions. While the era of precise targeting of humans in large groups--i.e., cities, buildings
or gathering places--all at once in the form of a planned attack seems remote. To many people it smells
of borderline Sci-Fi antics gone amuck. However, creativity in this sphere of research admits a wonderfully
complex convergent matrix of integrated technologies creating a pathway for its eventual appearance along
with a few unexpected issues. It is not far-fetched to imagine satellite leveraged EMF directed to clueless cell
phone users or equivalent signals disruptive of normal synaptic and dendrite connectivity inside the brain.
Neural waves contain low levels of magneto-electronic activity, and we must acknowledge that many modern
high EMF-emitting satellites in space which are being used to enhance internet speed, video surveillance and
communication here on earth can exert that effect whether intended or not.

   In 2012 chemists at New York University (NYU) created a nanoscale robot from DNA fragments that walks
on two legs just 10 nm long. This so-called "nanowalker," with the help of psoralen molecules attached to the
ends of its feet, takes its first baby steps: two forward and two back. Its creators envisage a future molecule-scale
production line, where molecules are shifted until the right location is reached. In this unique way a nanobot
injects chemistry like "spot-welding" on a car assembly line. This is a decent example of "biomimetics," where
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                          METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 319

with nanotechnology they can imitate some of the biological processes in nature, such as the behavior of DNA,
to engineer new methods and even improve them. So, while its medical benefits are clear, the perversion of such
science for insidious and damaging purposes by nefarious actors and state sponsored enemies is also reinforced.

   Recently a study published in 2022 in the Journal Neurology found that a higher daily intake of ultra-
processed foods was associated with a substantially higher risk of dementia. The researchers were also able to
determine that substitution of some ultra-processed foods with unprocessed or minimally processed foods
was associated with a lower risk of dementia. In that study 72,000 participants were identified from the
UK Biobank and all participants were at least 55 years old and did not have dementia at the start of the
study. Participants were followed for an average of 10 years, during which they filled out questionnaires
regarding their diet which included processed foods. By the end of the study, 518 people were diagnosed with
dementia. The controversy over nanotech, including independently credible assessments of its actual risks,
always confronts supporters and detractors. The WHO recently went on record as well saying,

   "The properties of nanomaterials, and of engineered nanoparticles in particular, have raised concern about
unwanted or unexpected interactions with biological systems, which could result in adverse consequences to human
and ecosystem health. Though rapidly growing, knowledge on these aspects is limited and many uncertainties
remain. " (McMillen, 2015)

   So, the unanswered questions about nanoparticles in food, their net impact on how the body and brain store
and contend with their presence and the implications of stored nanoparticles in terms of human health is a
subject not often addressed or discussed among major media. So, we are left to speculate about the interactive
aspects of nanotech embedded as it is with RF, electromagnetics and other technologies this far mentioned on
human neurological health. For example, the chart below simply illustrates a portion of the nanotech effect
in our food supply. (Ghebretatious & et.al., 2021) (Gaidos, 2015) (Sahdev & et.al., 2014) (Nature Reviews -
Staff, 2021) (centerforfoodsafety.org - Staff / Editorials, 2023)

   As a direct consequence we now have reason to raise concerns about IOT, cyber, quantum computers,
nanotech, EMF, and related substances which form an arguable electronic gateway into human mental
functions, cognition, and brain health. Apart from marvelous and beneficial aspects of medical research and
scientific inquiry seeking to blend these technologies into better human health we understand the covert
engineered diversion and perversion of these technologies for impairing cognition and degrading neurological
health is plainly wide open to exploitation by bad actors. This confers an entirely new meaning to the
conventional term `brainstorm' which does not explicitly refer to the lightening quick appearance of a great
idea or insight Instead it depicts the covert insidious destruction and degradation of cognitive health,
neurological wellbeing via external nonkinetic technologies which exploit neurobiological vulnerability.
   Worst of all we find it difficult to ascertain sponsored government or industry hosted objective studies which
outline the impact, risks and consequences of engineered technology convergence involving these disparate
systems on the human body and brain. Is this yet another area where trusting the experts and allowing periodic
government scrutiny and oversight supply the margin of safety, we consumers expect? What entity provides the
safeguards to create speed-bumps and guardrails around the explicit mixing of technologies without examining
the immediate and long-term effects of their engineered combination?
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                          METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 321

   So, we are left to ponder the degree to which social media and pervasive influence factors such as Tik Tok.
Aside from its appeal as entertainment, serving as a platform for exchanges of video material among people, it
provides a subtle but powerful impact on human cognition especially among young adults whose brains are
still undergoing cognitive growth and biophysical maturation. Their brain chemistry and neurological stability
are still developing and yet that offers the ripest and most delectable target for Tik Tok designers to exploit.

   Tik Tok symbolizes and reflects a wider confluence of exploitive technologies having a measurable effect on
young brains, perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors which is still regarded as benign and annoying by many
adults and our own government. Our Congress is focused on the issue as Senators Hawley of Missouri and
Rubio of Florida have proposed bills that would bar Tik Tok from government IOT devices. In addition,
Senators Blumenthal of-Connecticut and Moran of Kansas teamed up to demand the Biden administration
impose a wall between TikTok's U.S. operations and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A Senate hearing
urged TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew "to consider his platform's harm to a generation of Americans." "TikTok
is digital fentanyl," said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., the chair of the new House select committee in China.
(Scott Wong, 2023)

   Judging from prevalent effects which social media has on young people and adults we must draw renewed
attention to its indirect neurological influences which are detrimental. Tik Tok illustrates the almost hypnotic
influence which that platform has on youngsters and its ability to trigger, support, and encourage dangerous
and destructive behavior such as the various and infamous Tik Tok challenges' which so often result in
physical harm to those succumbing to its Ethernet whims. A 2021 study on TikTok's specific neurological
effects examined how Douyin, China's TikTok equivalent, affects Chinese college students' brains. It found
that watching personalized, algorithm-selected videos activates reward centers in the brain much more
than watching random videos that have not been chosen specifically for the viewer. (Miller, 2022)

   In a 2022 Harvard medical review of the issue involving Tik Tok it was found that the first known
examples of social media-induced sociogenic illness were recognized in the period 2020-2022, a time coinciding
with the pandemic. Neurologists began seeing increasing numbers of patients, especially teenage girls, with
unusual, involuntary movements and vocalizations reminiscent of Tourette syndrome. After ruling out other
explanations, the tics in these teenagers seemed related to many hours spent watching TikTok videos of people
who report having Tourette syndrome and other movement disorders. Posted by social media influencers,
these videos have billions of page views on TikTok; related videos are available on YouTube and other sites.
(Shmerling, 2022)

   Indirect but effective neurological disruptions and displacement of normal cognitive functions tied to the
visual, auditory, and routine sensory ingestion of social media such as Tik Tok on a regular basis indicates
more must be done to sort out any hidden NeuroStrike factors and injurious elements of these media. We
lack a comprehensive understanding of their net immediate, long term and covertly embedded impact on
young minds and whether they open the door to other forms of external influence, manipulation, or control.
Being naive about this threat and separating it conveniently from other influence technologies such as AI,
quantum, cyber, nanotech and EMF is a dangerously narrow-minded strategy which thwarts a comprehensive
322 | NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

strategic assessment of its genuine power. We do not know enough to provide cautionary warnings which are
preventative and timely for those most likely to be affected.

   The central task is not to raise alarms and point to unmanaged risks arising from the explicit and deliberate
blending of these technologies. Our goal is to pinpoint our innate vulnerability to the silent hidden and
perverse engineering of these technologies for which we lack strategic warning, adequate defenses, robust
deterrent measures, and operational strategies to nullify and defeat those who would wield such damaging
technology against us. Opportunities for enemy interests to magnify the scope, scale and effect of these
insidious technologies are unlimited for several reasons

  · We are focused on and distracted by glossy kinetic high dollar defense systems
  · Evidence of deliberate NeuroStrike technology in enemy hands is unconvincing
  · We lack hard facts about the exploitable neural pathways for NeuroStrike
  · We lack consensus on candidate technologies which comprise NeuroStrike
  · We are unable to accept that enemy interests have perfected NeuroStrike
  · We are far from finding powerful countermeasures to nullify NeuroStrike

The key challenge after 2022 is discerning the nature, scope, scale, magnitude and focus of enemy NeuroStrike
capabilities. We must devise effective deterrent and offsetting technologies ourselves to diminish a threat that
has been ripening and maturing for at least a decade. Military and civilian leadership is at critical risk that
NeuroStrike will only become more sophisticated as time unfolds and its damage to larger groups of people is
manifest. Building defenses is important but even more so is the task of attaining resilience against it.

BUILDING NEUROSTRIKE RESILIENCE IN THE MIDST OF TECHNOLOGY TSUNAMI

When one imagines a future replete with modern state-of-the-art technological breakthroughs and emerging
complex and hybrid technologies the general public welcomes anything which simplifies and enhances
ordinary life. However, where many advanced areas of scientific inquiry such as genomics, nanotech, biotech,
cyber mechanics, geomagnetic systems, and electronics are explicitly merged and engineered via deliberate
convergence into something never before seen our collective ability to estimate and foresee adverse and
dangerous outcomes is opaque and ambiguous. This is the central dilemma and security nightmare which a
headlong race to devise, develop and sustain an ill-defined Metaverse includes.

   Using a mix of the most advanced science and technology systems and platforms to create a faux parallel
cyber grounded reality esteemed and admired as more inherently attractive and beneficial than reality itself.
The quest for a metaverse where no organizational, personal or government entity can assume primordial
governance and creative ownership of it opens the door to insidiously dangerous mischief where our neural
and behavioral safeguards and intuitive autonomous systems are outmaneuvered. It creates to a degree, so far
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                         METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 323

unanticipated or expected, an evolving appetite for dwelling in the allegedly majestic and fantastic environment
which the metaverse promises to establish.

NEUROSTRIKE: A METAVERSE IMPAIRED MINEFIELD

The metaverse is a set of virtual three-dimensional spaces where you can share immersive experiences with other
people even when you cannot be together. It will be inherently social; you will be able to hang out with friends,
collaborate with colleagues, learn, shop, and create - among other things. Its most enthusiastic supporters and
fanatical endorsers cannot see any downside to the emergence of the metaverse and welcome its arrival warmly
as a life experience enhancing experience.

   Being mindful the metaverse swallows up, replicates, and substitutes itself for reality with seductive
immersion in V/R and A/R, humans are ill equipped to divert their attention away from so attractive a source
of faux enlightenment. Here it is truly insidious qualities are revealed as deftly skilled AI, quantum and IOT
engineers achieve a parallel experiential universe more appealing and satisfying than real life itself. One must
accept the fact that those wishing to dwell inside the metaverse will always be open to its invitation and
some will enter for a brief period and be deluded while others will opt to remain there much longer. The
deceit is grounded on the principle that access to the metaverse is not exclusively by their own choice as any
would believe. Instead, just as the maturation of quantum, AI, IOT, nanotech, neurobiological factors, EMF,
Magento-biology and NeuroStrike demonstrate it is orchestrated externally as a covert weapon of influence
destabilizing leaders, managers, commanders, and everyday people.

   A healthy dose of skepticism seems warranted here. It is attractive because it offers an escapist gateway into a
faux reality that allows an endless series of fantasy adventures and unlimited entertainment experiences which
can be terminated easily by simply unplugging form the program or removing the special V/R equipment. But
wait a minute!! The metaverse is not just VR! It is not just one dimensional. Those metaverse junctions and
entry ports will connect the person with AR glasses and launch them into a world of unrivalled imaginary
experiences in dreamlike quality where the person actually sees themselves operating in that virtual
environment. One of its chief sponsors and supporters has said, "...there will be a real sense of continuity
where the things you buy are always available to you." (Shah, 2021) Other metaverse advocates say, ".the
metaverse will be an infinite realm that blankets both the physical and virtual worlds. At its core will be a
self-contained economy that allows individuals and businesses to create, own or invest in a range of activities
and experiences. Like the internet, it will not be just one thing-but several layers of different technologies,
products, and languages." (NOBELL, 2023)

   They argue vehemently that the metaverse bridges physical and digital realities in ways where the interface
offers a spatial version of the Internet . . . Ideally, the metaverse is highly customizable and as separate or
integrated into our physical realities as necessary--and desired. Therefore, the metaverse experience can be
altered from the individual's point of view and shaped or curated by any number of agents--whether human
or A.I. The metaverse, together with our physical locations, forms a spatial continuum. The very materials of
324 | NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

the metaverse are math and imagination, so we can create buildings or garments made here to function in new,
more ambitious, and inspired ways than their counterparts in the physical world. (CHERUKURI, 2021)

   Advocates for the metaverse will extol its benign and harmless features. It will find a place in everyone's living
room along with the TV, fireplace and couch. Consumers and entrepreneurs will all be able to interact amid
the metaverse. Gamers, and coworkers sitting around a table as digital holograms for a conference as opposed
to a video call, making virtual meetings seem more natural as it is in 3D. The A/R and v/R applications of the
metaverse are limitless and it really can become the next great version of the internet. These depictions of the
metaverse--especially by its most ardent fans--sound useful and beneficial. But like every other technology
discussed thus far that can influence, leverage, alter and undermine cognitive functions and neurological
activity there is adequate reason for caution.

   These cautions are rooted in several fundamental questions which ought to guide, govern, and inform
further excursions into ambitious enthusiastic metaverse development

   -- what regulatory, safeguards and security principles will apply to it?
   -- what organization, entity or group will control, manage, and provide it?
   -- what restrictions, boundaries, cautions and requirements will be included in it?
   -- what measures will be taken to ensure that those visiting it can freely depart from it?
   Here there is room enough for serious doubt, cynicism, and outright repudiation as even the most strident
supporters of the metaverse can argue it is still decades distant in appearing and scientifically impossible to
establish. In effect many dispute whether a metaverse can even be devised, developed and sustained. Excursions
into the metaverse by persons and families are not just PG-13 ventures into a dreamworld where one can
operate with elements of freedom and emerge safely back into reality unscathed either psychologically or
neurologically from the experience. In fact, there is no scientific evidence which provides assurance that those
inhabiting the metaverse for 30 minutes and returning back to reality are the same people in terms of their
cognitive security and intellect. Measuring what actually happens to the human brain while swimming inside
the metaverse remains an unknown equation and arcane theory as yet unproven and unknown. Look at the
extraordinary precautions we used to prepare astronauts for space travel. Did we plan to do as much for those
wearing V/R headsets?
   Again, the essential concept of a dual parallel reality available for a short V/R diversion, or a multi-day
investment of time indicates people may wish to inhabit the false reality as superior and more rewarding
than real life itself. What is more perverse is considering the capability of evil geniuses devising a Metaverse
as friendly and accessible as Tik Tok where kids and adults alike can disappear and never return--either
mentally or physically. This would entail the deliberate collective engineered convergence of quantum, AI,
EMF, nanotech, magneto-biology, and other technologies to validate an operational universe playland where
thousands would drift towards it for the fantasy experience just as surely as throngs await the next generation
smartphone release. Too much to imagine? Very unlikely and too Sci-Fi to contemplate? Well then consider
the reality of NeuroStrike itself. If you doubt that its effects are genuine--anything science and technology
produces is ironically attractive.

                                                                                                                         METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 325

   Metaverse dilemmas can arise in expected and unexpected ways and reside in subtle venues which have
many security implications deserving a closer look. There are simply too many ramifications of metaverse
adoption to be exhaustively examined and discussed here but sensible caution and risk management criteria
must be diligently applied to avoid succumbing to the nuanced and seductive nature of presumptive metaverse
benefits. With the emergence of every single dual use technology in the 21st century we must confront
the hidden, unknown and subtle risks of misusing or redirecting that technology away from its benign
and beneficial intentions and capabilities to create instead an unforeseen weapon or instrument of societal
repression and control. Dual-use Science and Technology [DUST] is the hallmark of 21st century creativity
and power but contains within itself also the ingredients of humanity's demise.

   More sensible and coherent risk analysis must be applied to fully grasp the implications of the metaverse
on many of our essential societal and industrial systems. While it can never be assumed that unethical and
unscrupulous hostile nations, terrorist groups or criminal elements will reject using the metaverse to acquire
more power, leverage control and unleash mayhem it is a stark warning. It means that modern civilized nations
blissfully unaware could be targeted and therefore must remain wary and vigilant to grasp the true spectrum
of metaverse threats. This calls for serious sophisticated wargaming of metaverse risk scenarios--who will do
it?

   For example, if the metaverse expands under a climate of unfettered technology oversight it can readily be
used by institutions, organizations, government and the military to covertly impose a regulatory scheme in
social, political and economic spheres by concentrating cyber power in vested groups who possess custodial
controls over it. Observers have called the metaverse a `convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality
operating seamlessly in a parallel virtual' space' coexisting with bona fide reality itself. (Vanorio, 2020)
We know the metaverse as envisioned skillfully blends augmented reality [AR] with extended reality [XR]
utilizing a mixed reality system [MR] to create a virtual reality world [VR]. The MR construct enables free
flowing movement between genuine reality and AR where the user enters the VR portal causing real data and
images to be replaced by virtual data and images. Thus VR fulfills its designer's ultimate purpose by smoothly
replacing the real world with a simulated one.

   This means using AR/VR technology enables the illusion and felt experience of trading genuine reality for
a cyber created reality. This has serious and unforeseen security implications of long-term concern. We are
already familiar with digital replication technologies, erasing images from video streams to alter a landscape,
being fooled by deep-fakes and other alternative distortions of visual perception where a person's actual
location is at considerable variance with what VR says is his/her augmented location. So the metaverse could
make images of people appear in places where in reality they are not. Crisis management, military threat
analysis and spatial orientation to confirm place and location would be compromised. Memories, emotional
reactions and behavioral anomalies could occur impairing breathing, heart rate, judgement and balance. Likely
the true physiological and neurological impact of metaverse experience has never been medically evaluated for
its overall human effects. This begs the question of how that would be accomplished and verified to enable safe
continued metaverse operations.
326 | NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

   At least two aspects of the evolving metaverse merit a pause--its dark web and physical-cyber threats. Some
have argued the metaverse is more dangerous than the dark web because of the pseudo-physical presence of
the users mimicking clandestine physical meetings versus the purely online open discussion threads in dark
web criminal forums. (Numaan Huq, 2022) It seems almost everything a user does will be under unlimited
surveillance by the metaverse owner/ operators who will enjoy unprecedented visibility into user actions
where privacy conveniently evaporates. Tyrannical and repressive regimes can use the metaverse to control,
subdue and govern people as state owned metaverse operators collect troves of user data and exploit it for
advantage. As an example, critical infrastructure (CI) facilities will have physical equipment connected to
metaverse platforms featuring `helpful' digital twins ostensibly for safety and maintenance reasons which
enables benign remote work. However, it also potentially exposes CI to external cyberattacks via the metaverse
and theoretically brings in outsiders able to sabotage CI systems and functions. Criminal access to a power
plant's digital twin can exploit it to gain unlawful access to the plant's internal systems or its internal ICS/
SCADA environment. Worse criminals can use digital blueprints of the site to plot their attacks or plan
entry/ exit approaches to power plants and possibly nuclear reactors. How does this change the set of risk
considerations and security measures which must be incorporated to offset this?

   Another disturbing area of metaverse intrusion which seems harmless at first would be full-body actuator
suits giving users [surgeons and maintenance personnel] the ability to physically feel things inside the
metaverse. Metaverse systems can allow users to touch an object, sense a push, feel a jump, experience the
interactive elements, and derive the `hands on' feel of reality. However, this opens the door to dangerous cyber-
physical threats where malicious code embedded in these body suits can cause a malfunction, endangering the
user by inducing extreme heat, cold, pain or visual effects distorting reality to triggering seizures. Criminal
elements can gain access to bodysuits via cyber intrusion and monitor the user's actions.

   Curbing adoption and implementation of metaverse technologies will be difficult. Champions advocating
metaverse use will be relentless during the 21st century. Those harboring doubts or legitimate concerns will
encounter stiff and resolute resistance from inventors, scientists and civilian leaders who will extol its many
benefits while overlooking its risks and security pitfalls. Again the forces of modernity may prevail over those
hesitant to embrace all the good and bad which comes along whenever DUST is accepted and promoted.

   What we have described about the metaverse is worth thinking about. Using a mix of the most advanced
science and technology systems and platforms to create a faux parallel cyber grounded reality much more
inherently attractive and beneficial than reality itself we stumble upon the ultimate escape. The quest for
a metaverse free space where no organizational, personal or government entity can assume primordial
governance and creative ownership of it is breathtaking. However, it opens the door to insidiously dangerous
mischief where our neural and behavioral safeguards and intuitive autonomous systems are outmaneuvered. It
creates to a degree, so far unanticipated or expected, an unrequited and evolving appetite for dwelling in the
allegedly majestic and fantastic environment which the metaverse promises to establish. For all to enjoy.

   In strategic terms as the decade beginning in 2020 rolls ahead without hesitation into its third year, we face
a crossroads of geopolitical analysis where assigning blame and ultimate responsibility for both the good and
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                         METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 327

bad arising from the engineered convergence of these technologies must be assessed. In more stringent terms
we must confront the degree to which explicit convergence of these technologies actually confers the kind of
strategic advantage which leverages global history in favor of one nation over the others. It is therefore fair to
ask who benefits from this massive endeavor?

STRATEGIC MYOPIA AND CHINA BLINDNESS

In turn this historic crossroads must be assessed against the present-day forces of geostrategic reality.
Dominant military enterprises, research institutes, decades long R&D ventures in innovative technology and
sophisticated high-tech espionage depict the Peoples Republic today. Their relentless quest to sit atop the
global superpower club drives their respective ambitions and unlimited appetite to further the deliberately
engineered technology convergence which is the heart of this essay. This is not to claim that other nations are
not busy pursuing the same set of outcomes but instead to reinforce the point that the West--especially the
USA--is woefully behind in the frantic race for supremacy in this arena. Worse, many of these nations are
blissfully unaware that Chinese military investment in and perfection of this set of convergent technologies
is happening at a pace and scale which conveys a distinct strategic advantage. This is both myopia and
China blindness. There is no immediate remedy for the shortcoming but reckoning with it honestly as a
serious security shortfall is a start. Kinetic systems capture the imagination and win the lion's share of budget
dollars. There is a disturbing tendency among commercial and government leadership to favor short term
issues and challenges over the longer-term view which deals explicitly with the security and stability of the
enterprise itself. This is also known as strategic myopia which refers to intense focus on short term issues,
gains, objectives, and challenges to the extent that anything longer term is ignored, overlooked, or diminished
in significance. For example, having the US focus on the Russia-Ukraine war, or climate change, or the World
Economic Forum dicta about ESG to the utter exclusion of legitimate geopolitical threats such as China, secure
US borders, drug cartel dominance in Mexico, declining leverage in US made goods and trade imbalances
and many others. When one contemplates the insidious, gradual, and covertly growing momentum which
convergently engineered IOT, quantum, nanotech, metaverse perversion and NeuroStrike symbolizes the
threshold endgame significance as tipping point strategic leverage becomes clear. Tragically, among senior US
defense leadership--both civilian and military--there is ample manifestation of strategic myopia which fosters
widespread concern. Traditional defense bulwarks such as new weapons systems, investing in troop training,
upgrading special operations versatility, overhauling logistics requirements, acquiring space, IOT, quantum
and nanotech superiority have fallen into a quiet trance. Our defenses against future biotech, synthetic biology
and genomic weapons are at least 15 years behind their most desirable position. Even some senior Pentagon
officers have spoken out about this aware that their energetic call to arms is being ignored in the process.

   "I will be very honest with you. It is very unsettling to see how much the US is not connecting the dots on
our number one challenge," Rear Adm. Mike Studeman, the commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence,
told attendees here at the West 2023 conference in San Diego. "It is disturbing how ill-informed and naïve
328 | NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

the average American is on China. I chalk this up, if I could summarize, into a China blindness. We face a
knowledge crisis and a China blindness problem," he continued. Studeman's blunt comments come as the
White House, the Pentagon, and the country at-large deal with the fall-out of a Chinese high-altitude balloon
that violated US airspace (Katz, 2023)

   So, the question lingering in the atmosphere is simple--If the NeuroStrike threat is real and it is founded on
the explicit convergent engineering of several key technologies mentioned herein which the USA has thus far
overlooked, dismissed, or ignored what does that suggest about future American security and societal stability
among our allies in the West? The answer is to speculate openly about at least three outcomes...

   1--West and USA discern NeuroStrike threat effectively confronting and defeating it
   2--West and USA dismiss/ignore NeuroStrike threat and become 3rd rate powers
   3--The NeuroStrike threat scenario never happens at all is the globe is secure

PRIMARY PRINCIPLES AND THE PRIMACY OF THE POO POO PASHAS

The underlying principles in grasping NeuroStrike entail a mix of technologies combined with well-established
and scientifically verified studies of negative cognitive effects stemming from the so-called Frey effect and the
work of acoustics genius Ross Adey. Of course, deniers, artful dodgers from the intelligence community, and
media hawks unaccustomed to probing scientific phenomena which contain anomalies will inhabit the poo
poo pasha sect. Those focused on truth and medical facts must arrive at a different conclusion. Very simply
the nonkinetic yet invasive neurological degradation system called NeuroStrike is very real and has dozens of
government scientists and other experts engaged in validating its operational metrics and discerning ways to
thwart its effects. Defense of persons and creation of early warning and eventual countermeasures to quell
NeuroStrike attacks in the future is well underway.

   This fact exists apart from the faux vision of reality which the leader of US intelligence at ODNI denies is
`hostile' or originates from a foreign threat source. (ODNI, 2023) The denial of NeuroStrike as a legitimate
threat is puzzling and counterintuitive for several reasons. First there are hundreds of victims seeking authentic
cognitive treatment and relief where medical experts are today attempting to reduce cognitive degradation
effects. Secondarily the reports of random isolated NeuroStrike attacks remain viable and confirmable as
recently as March 1, 2023-coincidentally the same date as ODNI denies its authenticity. Thirdly a dedicated
cadre of experts are investigating the contributing factors underpinning NeuroStrike on both sides of the
Atlantic and they are pursuing this quest without the ODNI bias that so-called victims are experiencing
episodes of emotional or psychological trauma. Fourth, the laws passed by Congress to compensate verified
victims of NeuroStrike have been in place for 2 years and some have been reimbursed for their medical
expenses and others continue to seek qualification under those laws for onward treatment. Fifth, prominent
US government analysts and diplomats who have gone on record with media interviews have never repudiated
their basic narratives about the effects of NeuroStrike on themselves and their families.

   A dilemma of genuine national security proportions looms from this analysis because if the technology
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                         METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 329

behind Havana Syndrome [i.e., NeuroStrike] is real, and such attacks continue, and thousands of people
remain injured from this technology, and we have reason to suspect a foreign power controls this technology
and it poses a future threat to military and civilian leadership as well as ordinary warfighting troops we
have a problem. Is it a problem more serious than global warming, equity or finding pathway to sustainable
development--indeed it is. But unless our leadership sees it that way, we risk becoming victimized strategically
for lack of vision and geopolitical courage.

   So, we are left with a conclusion that is far more plausible and credible than an official denial levied by a
US government agency. After all the sordid experience of Americans with COVID amply illustrates a breach
of trust between citizens and their government on the trustworthiness and reliability of guidance on masks,
shutdowns, vaccines, and what cohort groups ought to be vaccinated we can read for ourselves the hypocrisy
involved. The primary principles on NeuroStrike which emerge from all this are

  · NeuroStrike is real and authentic, not imagined or theoretical.
  · NeuroStrike attacks have damaged many hundreds of victims thus far
  · NeuroStrike attacks continue into 2023.
  · Technologies at the core of NeuroStrike are under serious investigation.
  · Protecting US diplomats, military, and IC personnel against NeuroStrike is key.
  · Determining if ordinary US citizens have been victimized by NeuroStrike is key
  · Discerning the technological core of NeuroStrike is a paramount security goal
  · Devising defense/deterrence/defeat technologies against NeuroStrike is key.
  · Confirming foreign sponsors/owners of NeuroStrike is a priority security issue.

Surely there can be little doubt that fundamentally these principles must guide our national survey and inquiry
about NeuroStrike over the next few years to dispel all doubt, decode any lingering mystery and validate its
technological essence and foreign sponsor well before 2025. If we have trouble seeing the confluence of cyber,
AI, nanotech, the metaverse and mixed RF, magnetic, acoustic, and vestibular factors involved then one should
join the critics who regard NeuroStrike as an evil fantasy.

   To overlook. misjudge or underestimate the strategic significance of NeuroStrike and its indirect links to
AI, cyber, nanotech, ChatGPT and the metaverse is a fatal error. The linkage is palpable and insidiously
unfolding outside the facile and inquisitive eyes of major media and academic experts for two good reasons.
Number one they are in love with modern technology and all it potentially offers. Number two, they are
abysmal in discerning threats to society rooted in advanced technology as their paradigm posits a world made
comprehensively better because of technology itself. Years ago, the prescient author Mary Shelley wrote about
the dangers of science and renegade ego running amuck in her famous treatise on Frankenstein where the
monster devours its creator. We risk the same outcome because of widespread arrogance and naivete where the
contours of unrestricted technology as threat vs technical savior wins out. (Shelly, 1818)

   There is ample room for caution, doubt, and skepticism when one combines AI, nanotech, cyber,
330 | NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT]

neurotechnology and ChatGPT into some amorphous insidious convergent monster that strips humanity of
its sovereign controls over mental functions and cognitive operations. However, that reasonable signpost of
caution and doubt must be dispelled in part because the obvious and latent convergence of these technologies
has already happened and is being upgraded for effectiveness and reliability. It reflects a concept also known
as `attack surface management' [ASM] which involves a combination of people, processes, technologies, and
services deployed to continuously discover, inventory, and manage an organization's assets. These assets can be
both internal and external, and they pose digital risks. This visibility can help reduce exposure that could be
exploited by malicious threat actors which entail internal, external, and digital risks. (Paloaltonetworks - Staff,
2022) The unknown vulnerabilities we confront or ignore will spell out our collective humanitarian future.

   The watchword being offered here is that often we are blind to the full spectrum of our own vulnerabilities
which opponents can exploit to their advantage. While it makes sense to consider that ChatGPT, AI, cyber
systems, nanotech, neurobiological impairment platforms and the Metaverse can convergently combine in
insidious ways to harm us it requires some strategic perspective. The ASM construct suggests we may be
ignorant of all internal, external, and digital risks--including the oft neglected phigital realm where digital
and human factors coincide and dwell harmoniously. The day will surely arrive when scientists and innovative
engineers bereft of a moral code will create a cyborg that is autonomous and refuses to heel to our desperate
bidding. Only then will we fully comprehend the future Frankenstein which our imaginations have been born.

   What must happen today and urgently is to liberate ourselves from viewing the net impact of convergent
technology on humans and its incipient fascination. It is a dangerously flawed assumption which distracts
us from the genuine challenge. Instead, we ought to refocus ourselves towards establishing human direct and
indirect influence over all technology itself including strategies for zero-day controls and kill switches. By
protecting our innate cognition, perception and mental functions against technological interference, theft, and
hostile manipulation we can survive in spite of the machines which so ardently seduce us in spite of ourselves.
We must take a different pathway. The reciprocal option is that human logic, perception, imagination,
thought and design can warmly persuade us that nothing less than direct control, confinement, absolute
restriction and daily vigilant governance of technology is our best hope.

FINDING A WAY FORWARD AGAINST NEUROSTRIKE

The NeuroStrike threat is genuine and has racked up thousands of verifiable victims awaiting some form of
cognitive relief and genuine treatment to alleviate the persistent disabling syndrome its victims endure. Today
Europe and the United States can awake from a dangerous stupor and recognize the era of targeted cognitive
warfare where NeuroStrike is all but invincible is truly upon us. Such powerful technology in the wrong hands,
or in the hands of amoral scientific ghouls based in any society, leads us into a miasma of cognitive chaos and
abject mental cannibalism. Certainly, enemy possession of this technology can covertly bring down society, its
leaders, and its government with surgical precision as the technology is improved and modified to adversely
affect a wider target audience. If this remains an unknown threat and an unrecognized vulnerability, we are
            NEUROSTRIKE - THE CYBER, COGNITIVE, NANOTECH AND ELECTRONIC GATEWAY TO MINDFULLY IMPAIRED
                                                                                                                          METAVERSE [MCCREIGHT] | 331

doomed. Many will fall victim to its enduring appeal especially for those who would seek to subdue us all and
control human behavior conclusively as a blatant power move. This cannot be allowed to happen.

   If it fails to be clear now it should soon emerge as the obvious preferred scenario choice listed that choice #1
is the best path forward for America and the West. Recognizing, confronting, and defeating all manifestations
of the NeuroStrike threat is paramount. This will require devising robust early warning, sensor detection
capabilities, defensive and deterrent technologies, and standoff systems to impose nullification and defeat of
the NeuroStrike threat. This implies also finding a validation architecture for forensic analysis to determine
and validate the origin of future attacks. The term `attack' seems off-putting and controversial to so many.
However unpopular or quasi-offensive the term `attack' may be, it clarifies exactly what is happening.
Technology is targeting humans to strip them of cognition, will and logic and it edges every day towards a finer
degree of perfection.

   A better term than `NeuroStrike attack' is needed to make the idea more resonant with a doubtful public
and civic leadership? Should such terminology be clear enough that the old and noticeably young readily grasp
its significance and rail energetically against its continuation? Brain wars are clear enough and cognitive conflict
is appealing, however it must be a concept we all recognize as a foundational threat to humanity. There can
be no latent ambiguity. Can we call it a `hostile brainstorm" and thereby acquire wider public approval and
support? The jury is still out on the question. It is not at all clear--the only thing that is fundamentally clear is
what happens to civilization if we continue to ignore or overlook the NeuroStrike threat. Doing so is truly not
good at all.

BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN
SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER &
CARTER]

ABSTRACT

Biological threats in space pose significant challenges for human space exploration. It requires comprehensive
research and development of innovative strategies to mitigate risks and ensure the safety and sustainability of
space missions. This chapter provides an overview of biological threats to spacecraft and astronauts, including
technological development through time and considerations for future growth. It emphasizes the importance
of collaboration between government agencies, industry partners, and academic institutions to address the
complex issues of biological threats within new space exploration.

STUDENT OBJECTIVES

After reading this chapter, students should be able to do the following:

  · Explain the difference between forward and backward contamination when discussing biological threats
      in space.

  · Describe the diverse types of threats posed by pathogens within spacecraft.
  · Define critical technologies to mitigate biological risks and help advance space exploration.

INTRODUCTION

Biological threats and growth in space are two important topics that have gained significant attention in recent
years. The possibility of biological threats in space is a primary concern for astronauts and space agencies,
as exposure to harmful microorganisms can severely affect human health. As space exploration and research
continue to advance, the possibility of encountering biological threats in space becomes an ever-growing
concern. These threats can come from microorganisms, viruses, and other pathogens that may adversely affect
human health and the environment. Understanding the nature of these biological threats and developing
effective countermeasures is essential for ensuring safe and successful space missions. On the other hand,
338 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

growth in space has become an area of interest due to its potential to support long-term space missions and
even colonize other planets. This topic involves studying the behavior of living organisms in microgravity
conditions, vacuum, and high radiation environments, which can provide insights into the fundamental
principles of life.

DEFINITION OF BIOLOGICAL THREATS IN SPACE

Biological threats in space refer to the potential danger posed by microorganisms or pathogens that may
exist in extraterrestrial environments or travel from Earth into space habitats. The possibility of such threats
arises since microorganisms are ubiquitous and can survive in extreme conditions, including those in space. In
addition, human space exploration and colonization activities involve the introduction of new organisms into
extraterrestrial environments, which could disrupt existing ecosystems and pose risks to human health.

   The potential biological threats in space include both naturally occurring microorganisms and those that
are intentionally or accidentally introduced by humans. Naturally occurring microorganisms such as comets,
asteroids, and celestial bodies appear in extraterrestrial environments. These microorganisms may have evolved
to survive in extreme conditions such as low temperatures, high radiation levels, and lack of water. Intentional
or accidental introduction of microorganisms by humans can occur through the contamination of spacecraft
or equipment used for space exploration or through the release of waste materials into space habitats.

   Biological threats in space can be significant for human health and extraterrestrial ecosystems.
Microorganisms that harm humans can cause infections, allergies, and other health problems. In addition,
introducing new organisms into extraterrestrial environments can disrupt existing ecosystems and alter natural
processes.

   Various measures are continuously being developed and implemented by space agencies and organizations
to address the potential biological threats in space. These include strict protocols for spacecraft sterilization,
quarantine procedures for astronauts returning from space missions, and monitoring of extraterrestrial
environments for signs of microbial activity.

IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING BIOLOGICAL THREATS IN SPACE

The exploration and colonization of space have been a topic of interest for scientists and researchers for
decades. However, with the increasing number of missions and expeditions to space, there is a growing concern
about the potential biological threats that may arise. Studying biological threats in space is crucial to ensure the
safety and well-being of astronauts and prevent the spread of harmful microorganisms from Earth to Earth.

   One of the primary reasons for studying biological threats in space is the potential impact on human health.
The microgravity environment of space can weaken the immune system, making astronauts more susceptible
to infections. Moreover, harmless microorganisms on Earth may become virulent in space due to mutations
                               BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER] | 339

caused by radiation exposure or other environmental factors. Therefore, understanding the behavior and
evolution of microorganisms in space is essential to develop effective preventive measures and treatments.

   Another reason for studying biological threats in space is the risk of contamination. Spacecraft returning
from missions may carry microorganisms that can survive in the harsh conditions of space. If these
microorganisms are not adequately contained and decontaminated, they may threaten Earth's ecosystems and
public health. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and monitor potential contaminants and develop protocols
for their safe handling.

   Furthermore, studying biological threats in space can also provide insights into the origins of life on Earth
and other planets. Microorganisms found in extreme environments such as space may have unique genetic
adaptations that could shed light on the evolution of life on Earth and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

   Overall, studying biological threats in space is essential for ensuring the safety and well-being of astronauts,
preventing contamination, and advancing our understanding of life on Earth and beyond.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF BIOLOGICAL THREATS IN SPACE

                                             EARLY SPACE MISSIONS

Space exploration has always been a fascinating subject for scientists and researchers. However, discovering the
unknown comes with several risks, including biological threats. The potential risks of biological contamination
in space have been a concern since the beginning of space exploration.

   During World War II, the German army conducted experiments on human subjects to study the effects of
high altitude on the human body (Burgess & Dubbs, 2007). These experiments used high-altitude chambers
and pressurized suits that simulated high-altitude conditions. The experiments showed that exposure to high
altitude could cause severe physiological changes in the human body, including hypoxia and decompression
sickness. However, these experiments also raised concerns about potential biological contamination in space.

   According to a study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), "The first living
organisms sent into space were fruit flies aboard a U.S. V-2 rocket launched by the Army Ballistic Missile
Agency on February 20, 1947" (Joosse, 2023). Since then, various missions have been conducted, including
manned missions, that have exposed astronauts and spacecraft to different biological threats.

   From the 1950s to the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union launched several missions that carried
biological samples into space, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi (Beischer & Fregly, 1962). The multiple
missions' goal was to study the effects of microgravity and radiation on living organisms. However, they also
raised concerns about the potential to contaminate other planets or spacecraft.

   In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth (Mai, 1961). Several other manned missions
by both countries followed this achievement. However, these missions also raised concerns about potential
biological contamination in space. The astronauts were exposed to various microorganisms during their
340 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

training and preparation for space flight. There was a risk that microorganisms could contaminate the
spacecraft and infect other crew members.

   Concerns amplified between 1968 and 1972 with the U.S. Apollo missions to the moon. The possibility
of sending a person to a celestial object changed how scientists viewed biological contamination in space.
To address these concerns, NASA developed strict protocols for preventing biological contamination during
manned missions (Carter, 2001). These protocols included rigorous cleaning and sterilization of the spacecraft,
quarantine of the crew before launch, and monitoring the crew's health during the mission. These protocols
were effective in preventing any major biological incidents during manned missions. The same precautions
were taken during the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970s. However, only in the 1990s did the threat of
biological contamination in space become more widely recognized.

   One of the most famous incidents involving biological contamination in space occurred in 1967, when
the Surveyor 3 spacecraft returned to Earth, carrying bacteria that had survived on the moon's surface for
over two years (Rummel, Allton, & Morrison, 2011). This incident startled the aerospace community and
highlighted the need for stricter protocols to prevent contamination of other celestial bodies during future
missions. However, it was found later that the contamination came from personnel after the craft returned to
Earth.

   In 1971, the Soviet Union launched the first space station, Salyut 1 (Mars, 2021). This event marked a
new era in space exploration, allowing for longer-duration missions. However, with more extended missions
came new challenges in preventing biological contamination. The crew members were exposed to various
microorganisms for an extended period, increasing the risk of infection. To address these challenges, NASA
and other space agencies developed newer protocols for preventing biological contamination during long-
duration missions (Carter, 2001).

   However, one of the most significant events in the history of biological threats in space was the declared
discovery of life on Mars. Not only could we carry the threat of contamination to space, but there was
also a threat from above. In 1996, NASA announced that they had discovered evidence of microbial life on
a meteorite believed to have originated from Mars (Savage, Hartsfield, & Salisbury, 1996). The meteorite,
ALH84001, was recovered from Antarctica's Allan Hills ice field in 1984. Later, scientists from NASA who
analyzed the meteorite described what was fossilized bacteria on its surface. To this day, the discovery was
disputed by scientists. However, the discovery sparked renewed interest in the search for life on other planets
and increased concerns about the potential for contamination from outer space.

                                   FIGURE 9-1 The Allan Hills 84001 Meteorite

   The history of biological threats in space dates to the early days of space exploration. The potential risks
of biological contamination have always been a concern for scientists and researchers, which still holds today.
However, with the development of advanced technologies and strict protocols for preventing biological
contamination, the risk of a significant biological incident during manned missions has been significantly
reduced.
MODERN SPACE MISSIONS
Modern space missions have increasingly focused on studying biological threats in space and other planets.
Since the beginning of human space exploration, scientists have been concerned about the potential risks of
biological contamination and the spread of disease between our world and other celestial bodies. The unique
environment of space provides a valuable opportunity to study the effects of microgravity and radiation on
living organisms, including pathogens that could threaten human health. In recent years, several missions were
launched to study and help prevent biological threats to protect astronauts and future space travelers. These
missions have involved collaborations between various space agencies and private companies, including NASA,
the European Space Agency (ESA), the Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS), the China National
342 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

Space Administration (CNSA), SpaceX, and others. This section will briefly review recent and ongoing space
missions, including some of their experiments.

 1. International Space Station (ISS): The ISS is a joint project between NASA, ROSCOSMOS, ESA,
      JAXA, and CSA, continuously inhabited since November of 2000 (Howell, 2023). The ISS provides a
      unique platform for conducting long-term studies on the effects of microgravity on human physiology
      and biology. Several experiments have been conducted on board the ISS to study the effects of
      microgravity on bone density, muscle mass, cardiovascular function, immune system, and other
      physiological systems.

* Biomolecule Extraction and Sequencing Technology (BEST): This investigation occurs on the
International Space Station (ISS). This investigation aims to identify unknown microbial organisms that may
be present on the ISS and assess their potential risks to human health. The BEST investigation uses advanced
DNA sequencing technology to analyze samples collected from various surfaces on the ISS, including air filters,
water systems, and crew quarters (Johnson, 2018).

   * One of the primary goals of the ISS missions is to understand how microorganisms behave in microgravity
environments. Studies have shown that microorganisms can adapt to these conditions and become more
virulent, potentially threatening astronauts and spacecraft. To address this concern, NASA has launched
several missions to study microbial behavior in space, including the Microbial Observatory-1 (MO-1) mission
beginning in 2003 and the Microbial Tracking-1, 2, & 3 (MT-1, MT-2, MT-3) missions beginning in 2006.
This investigation uses specialized equipment to collect samples from various locations around the ISS, analyze
their genetic makeup, and track the movement of the microbes (Tabor, 2021).

2. Mars Science Laboratory (MSL): The MSL is a NASA mission that landed the Curiosity rover on

    Mars in 2012. The mission's primary objective is to study Mars's geology and habitability. However, the
    mission also includes several experiments to study the effects of radiation on living organisms. The rover
    carries a radiation detector that measures the levels of radiation on the Martian surface, which can help
    scientists understand how radiation affects living organisms in space (Dunbar, 2017).
3. ExoMars: is a joint mission between ESA and ROSCOSMOS that aims to search for signs of past or
    present life on Mars. The mission includes a rover and a stationary lander that will conduct experiments
    to study the Martian environment and search for biosignatures. One of the mission's key objectives is
    understanding how life can survive in extreme environments like Mars (European Space Agency, 2023).
4. The BioSentinel mission: is scheduled for launch in 2024. The mission will send a small spacecraft
    equipped with yeast cells into deep space to study the effects of cosmic radiation on living organisms.
    The yeast cells will be genetically modified to detect and report levels of radiation exposure, providing
    valuable data for future manned missions beyond low Earth orbit (Ahmed, 2022).
5. Bion-M: is a series of Russian space missions that aim to study the effects of microgravity and other
    spaceflight factors on living organisms. The missions have carried a variety of animals into space already,
344 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

      including mice, rats, geckos, and fruit flies, to study the effects of spaceflight on their physiology and
      behavior. The data collected from these missions enable scientists to understand better how living
      organisms adapt to the extreme conditions of space. Further launches for Bion-M missions will launch
      in 2024 (Kovo, 2014).
 6. The Mars Sample Return Mission will occur in the 2030s. The mission will involve collecting
      samples from Mars and returning them to Earth for analysis. One of the primary goals of this mission is
      to search for signs of past or present microbial life on Mars. Studying these samples could provide
      valuable insights into the potential for life beyond Earth and inform our understanding of biological
      threats in space (NASA, 2023).

These current space missions and scientific conferences demonstrate a growing interest in studying biological
threats in space and developing countermeasures to protect astronauts and future space travelers. Modern
missions are determined to study and prevent biological threats in space and are critical for ensuring the safety
of astronauts and protecting other celestial bodies from contamination. As space exploration expands, these
missions will play an increasingly important role in maintaining the integrity of our home and solar system.

EMERGENCE OF BIOLOGICAL THREATS IN SPACE

In the early stages of space exploration, The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) was established on
October 3, 1958, by the International Council for Scientific Unions. COSPAR's objectives were, and still are,
to "promote, on an international level, scientific space research, with emphasis on the exchange of results,
information, and opinions, and to provide a forum, open to all scientists, for the discussion of problems that
may affect scientific space research" (International Space Council, 2023). Through its guidance, The Outer
Space Treaty was signed on October 10, 1967, between the U.S., Moscow, and the U.K., with 113 countries
adding themselves to the agreement. The treaty formulated policies that spacefaring nations could adhere
to and was based on scientific knowledge. Article 9 of the agreement paved the way for regulations about
"Forward Contamination" and "Backward Contamination" during space travel (United Nations Office for
Outer Space Affairs, 2023).

   According to NASA's Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA), Forward Contamination refers to
the "unintentional transfer of terrestrial organisms or biological material from Earth to another celestial body,
such as a planet or moon" (Keith, 2021). Accidental transfer can occur during space exploration missions when
spacecraft, landers, or rovers carry microorganisms or other organic materials that may contaminate the target
environment. The concern is that if these organisms survive and proliferate on another celestial body, they
could interfere with scientific investigations and potentially compromise the search for extraterrestrial life.

   Backward Contamination, on the other hand, refers to "the potential contamination of Earth by
extraterrestrial organisms or biological material" (Keith, 2023). This contamination could occur when samples
collected from another celestial body are returned to Earth for analysis. The concern is that if any potentially
                               BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER] | 345

hazardous microorganisms or other biological entities are present in these samples, they could risk terrestrial
ecosystems and human health.

                             FIGURE 9-3 Bacteria found on Curiosity before launch

   Source: (Stromberg, 2014)
   Both forward and backward contamination are essential considerations in space exploration missions.
However, the big question is, can a pathogen survive in space?
   A pathogen describes an infectious microorganism or agent, such as viruses, bacteria, protozoa, prions,
viroids, or fungi (Alberts, Johnson, & Lewis, 2022). The question of whether a pathogen can survive in space
is a complex one, with many factors to consider. The short answer is that some pathogens can survive in
space. However, much depends on several variables, such as the type of pathogen, gravity, moisture, radiation
exposure, and whether it is inside of a vessel or outside of the vessel.
   One of the primary factors determining whether a pathogen can survive exposure outside a craft in space is
its ability to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation. In space, there is no atmosphere to protect against
346 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

solar radiation and other high-energy particles. Any pathogen exposed to these conditions would be subjected
to high levels of ionizing radiation, which can damage or destroy genetic material.

   However, some viruses are more resistant to radiation than others. For example, research has shown that the
bacteriophage T7 virus can survive exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, even when it is dried onto a
surface (Tom, Molineux, Paff, & Bull, 2018). Similarly, studies have found that other viruses, like adenovirus
and herpes simplex, can also survive exposure to ionizing radiation (Mezhir, et al., 2005).

   Another factor that plays a role in whether a pathogen can survive in outer space is its ability to resist
desiccation (drying out). No atmosphere or water vapor creates humidity in space, so any virus exposed to
these conditions would quickly dry out. However, some viruses are better adapted to dry environments than
others. For example, research has shown that norovirus (which causes gastroenteritis) can survive on surfaces
for several days, even when completely dry (Warnes & Keevil, 2013).

   Overall, while some pathogens can survive in the vacuum of space, the conditions are harsh and
inhospitable. Most organisms would not be able to withstand the extreme temperatures, radiation, and
desiccation in space on the outside of a vessel. Furthermore, without a contained environment, pathogens
could not reproduce or conduct metabolic processes independently. Instead, they rely heavily on sustainable
host environments to replicate and spread.

   On the other hand, the inside of a vessel traveling through space is different, carrying humans, moisture, and
a protective atmosphere to have pathogens thrive. Spaceflight has further demonstrated to have various effects
on microorganisms, including changes in their virulence and antibiotic resistance. Microgravity, radiation,
and other spaceflight-related stressors can alter microbial physiology and gene expression, potentially harming
outcomes.

   For example, one study found that Salmonella typhimurium bacteria grown in spaceflight conditions
exhibited increased virulence compared to their ground-grown counterparts (Nickerson et al., 2004). The
researchers also observed changes in the expression of genes related to bacterial metabolism, stress response,
and pathogenesis.

   Another study investigated the effect of spaceflight on Staphylococcus aureus, a common bacterial pathogen
that can cause a wide variety of clinical diseases such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
On the exterior of the human body, it is usually not a threat. Still, if introduced to the bloodstream or internal
tissues, it can cause various life-threatening infections. The researchers in the study found that S. aureus grown
in spaceflight conditions had increased virulence and antibiotic resistance compared to their "ground-based"
counterparts (Kim, et al., 2013).

   These studies suggest that spaceflight can change microbial physiology and virulence that may affect human
health during prolonged space missions. Continued research in this area is ongoing and needed to understand
better the mechanisms underlying these changes and to develop strategies for mitigating potential risks for
forward and backward contamination. Understanding these risks helps establish ethical guidelines and
protocols for planetary safety and preventing harmful contamination of our world and other celestial bodies.

TYPES OF BIOLOGICAL THREATS IN SPACE

Biological threats in space refer to the risks posed by microorganisms, viruses, and other biological agents to
the health and safety of astronauts and space travelers. These threats can arise from various sources, including
bacteria, fungi, viruses, plants, contaminated equipment, human carriers, and exposure to extraterrestrial
microorganisms. Biological threats and growth in space are a growing concern for the future of space
exploration. As humans continue to explore and colonize other planets, they will inevitably bring with them
their biological threats and be susceptible to microorganisms from otherworldly sources. In addition, the
growth of these organisms in space can be challenging to control due to the lack of gravity and other
environmental factors.

                                                       BACTERIA

The most common biological threat in space is bacteria. Bacteria are tiny, single-celled organisms that can
survive in extreme environments, including those in space. They can cause disease and infection if they contact
humans or other living organisms. Bacteria can also reproduce quickly, making them difficult to contain or
eliminate once they have established themselves in a new environment.

   Bacteria pose a significant threat to space exploration, as they can contaminate spacecraft and potentially
harm astronauts. According to the Encyclopedia of Microbiology, "The risk of contamination of other planets
or moons with terrestrial microorganisms is a major concern in space exploration" (Lederberg, et al., 2000).
Bacteria can survive in extreme conditions, such as those found in space, and potentially colonize other planets
or moons unless adequately contained.

   One example of the potential danger of bacterial contamination in space exploration is the case of the
Mars Viking missions in 1976. As described in the book Planetary Protection: Policy Development and
Implementation for Planetary Missions, "The Viking landers were sterilized before launch, but subsequent
studies showed that some bacteria survived the sterilization process and could have contaminated Mars" (Race
& Lupisella, 2020). These studies raise concerns about the possibility of introducing Earth's microorganisms
to other planets and potentially interfering with any native life that may exist there.

   Furthermore, bacterial contamination can also pose a threat to astronauts themselves. The book,
Astrobiology: A Short Introduction, notes that "Microbial contamination of life support systems onboard
spacecraft poses a risk to crew health and performance" (Catling, 2014). This concept is particularly
concerning for long-duration missions, such as those planned for future Mars missions, where astronauts
exposure to these contaminants for extended periods.

   Another example of threats was discovered on the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a unique
environment that presents several challenges for the survival of microorganisms. Despite the stringent
measures taken to prevent contamination, bacteria have been found on various surfaces in the ISS. These
348 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

bacteria are of great interest to scientists as they may possess unique characteristics that could be exploited for
various applications.

   Several studies have reported isolating and identifying bacterial strains from various surfaces in the ISS.
These bacteria belong to different taxonomic groups and possess diverse physiological and metabolic
properties. For instance, a study by (La Duc, et al., 2007) reported the isolation of 1,271 bacterial strains
from 8 locations in the ISS, including the dining table, toilet seat, and exercise platform. Most of these strains
belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Another study by (Camilla Urbaniak,
2022) identified a novel bacterial species named Methylobacterium Ajmalii from an air filter in the ISS. This
bacterium possessed unique metabolic capabilities that could be exploited for bioremediation purposes.

   In March 2021, a new species, named Methylobacterium Ajmaline, associated with three new strains,
designated IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, were reported to have been discovered, for the first time,
on the International Space Station.

                                            FIGURE 9-4 Methylobacterium

   Source: (Versalovic, 2011)
   Bacteria in the ISS raises concerns about their potential impact on human health and equipment
functionality. However, some studies have suggested that these bacteria may also have beneficial effects. For
example, a study by (Kim, et al., 2013) reported that some bacterial strains isolated from the ISS possessed
antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
Additionally, some bacterial strains were found to produce extracellular polymeric substances that could be
used for various applications, such as biofilm formation and drug delivery (Mikutta, Guggenberger, Haumaier,
Schippers, & Baumgärtner, 2012).
   The discovery of unknown bacterium strains in the ISS presents an exciting opportunity for further
exploration and research. These bacteria may possess unique characteristics that could be harnessed for various
applications, including bioremediation and drug delivery. However, their potential impact on human health
and equipment functionality must be addressed, and more studies are needed to fully understand their
properties and behavior in the ISS environment.
   Bacterial contamination poses a significant threat to space exploration due to its potential impact on
                               BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER] | 349

planetary environments and astronaut health. Further strict protocols for sterilization and planetary protection
are necessary to ensure the safety and success of future space missions.

                                                          FUNGI

Fungus is another type of biological threat that is in space. Fungi are microscopic organisms that feed on
organic matter, such as plants and animals. Left unchecked, they can cause diseases such as athlete's foot,
ringworm, and cancer. Fungi can also reproduce quickly, making them difficult to contain or eliminate once
they have established themselves in a new environment. Fungi are a diverse group of organisms that play
essential roles in various ecosystems on Earth. However, they can also threaten space travel and exploration,
as they are known to thrive in extreme environments, such as deserts and the deep sea. They can potentially
contaminate spacecraft and planetary surfaces. According to the Encyclopedia of Microbiology, "Fungi are
ubiquitous on Earth and can survive under extreme conditions of temperature, pH, radiation, and desiccation"
(Rummel, Allton, & Morrison, 2011). This resilience makes them a formidable challenge for space exploration
missions, where there should be a minimized risk of contamination.

   One of the main concerns with fungal contamination is its potential to interfere with scientific experiments.
Fungi can grow on equipment and instruments, affecting their accuracy and reliability. For example, fungal
growth on optical lenses can cause distortion or obstruction of the images (Rummel, Allton, & Morrison,
2011). Fungal contamination can also affect the integrity of samples collected from other planets or moons,
potentially altering, or destroying valuable data.

   Another potential problem is fungi's presence in spacecraft's air filtration systems. The Journal of Applied
Microbiology noted, "Air filtration systems are designed to remove particulate matter from the air, but they
may not effectively remove fungal spores" (Howell, 2023). Even if a spacecraft is thoroughly cleaned before
launch, it may still be contaminated with fungal spores that could grow and spread during the mission,
increasing the potential for fungi to cause health problems for astronauts. Fungal spores, if inhaled, cause
respiratory issues or allergies. Some species of fungi produce mycotoxins, which can be harmful if ingested or
inhaled. In addition, prolonged exposure to fungi can weaken the immune system, making astronauts more
susceptible to other infections.

   Another concern is the potential for fungi to contaminate food supplies. The book Astrobiology: A Very
Short Introduction explains that "Fungal contamination of stored food is a major problem on Earth and
could be an even greater problem on long-duration spaceflights" (Catling, 2014). Fungal growth on food could
render it inedible and release toxins that could harm astronauts.

   In addition to these practical concerns, there is also a scientific interest in studying how fungi behave in
space environments. However, as noted in the book Fungi in Biogeochemical Cycles, "The study of fungi
in space is complicated by the need to prevent contamination of extraterrestrial environments with terrestrial
microorganisms" (Gadd, 2006). Fungi can also pose a threat to planetary protection efforts. The Outer
Space Treaty of 1967 requires that all space missions avoid harmful contamination of celestial bodies (United
350 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, 2023). If fungi were to contaminate another planet or moon, it could
potentially introduce Earth-based life forms that could interfere with any native life that may exist there. Fungi
contamination means strict protocols ensure that fungi experiments do not inadvertently introduce them into
the studied environment.

   The threat of fungal contamination is a significant challenge for space exploration missions. As the book
Space Microbiology states, "The potential for contamination of extraterrestrial environments with terrestrial
microorganisms is a critical issue for all space exploration missions" (Stutte, Flynn, & Acevedo, 2008). Careful
planning and rigorous cleaning protocols must be in place to ensure that spacecraft and habitats remain free of
fungal contamination; this will mitigate risk.

                                                        VIRUSES

"Viruses are entities whose genomes are elements of nucleic acid that replicate inside living cells using the
cellular synthetic machinery and causing the synthesis of specialized elements that can transfer the viral genome
to other cells" (Luria, Darnell, Baltimore, & Campbell, 1978). The newly developed discipline of studying
viruses in space is called Astrovirology, a subdiscipline of astrobiology.

   The possibility of viral contamination in space is a significant concern for space agencies and scientists. The
presence of viruses in spacecraft or on extraterrestrial surfaces could pose a threat to astronauts' health and
compromise scientific research. Viruses are much smaller than bacteria and can spread through contact with
infected individuals or objects. They can cause serious illnesses such as influenza, measles, and even HIV/AIDS
if left unchecked. Viruses can also mutate quickly, making them difficult to treat or contain once introduced
into a new environment.

   One of the primary concerns regarding viral contamination is the potential for viruses to mutate in space.
Research has shown that microgravity can alter the behavior of viruses, making them more virulent or resistant
to treatment (Aunins, et al., 2018). Microgravity could lead to new, more dangerous strains that could be
difficult to control. Additionally, harmless viruses on Earth could become dangerous in space due to changes
in the immune system and other physiological factors.

   Another concern is the potential for viruses to spread rapidly in the confined environment of a spacecraft.
As humanity continues to explore space, the possibility of encountering viruses becomes a growing concern.
While space is a sterile environment, spacecraft and other equipment sent into space are not as germ-free. These
objects can carry microorganisms, including viruses, which could threaten astronauts and their missions. With
close quarters and recycled air systems not working correctly, it could facilitate the transmission of viruses
between crew members, potentially leading to an outbreak (Novikova, 2006). Furthermore, viruses are likely
the most common cause of infectious disease attributed to enclosed environments. Close personal contact
within a spacecraft or a space colony makes them ideal places to spread viral infections.

   Astronauts experience a weakened immune system when they travel in space. One research study showed
that Increased levels of stress hormones such as cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, epinephrine, and
                                BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER] | 351

norepinephrine, coupled with a decreased cell-mediated immunity, contributed to the reactivation of latent
herpes viruses in astronauts (Rooney, 2019). The study also included that viral reactivation was evident
through the shedding of viral DNA in the body fluids of astronauts, and the viral load only increased with
more time in space. As the viral load increased, it naturally triggered an increase of viral shedding by 60%,
and with some subjects, the shedding increased by 96% (Rooney, 2019). Additionally, more than one virus
reactivates at a time, potentially compounding the physiological ramifications of uncontrolled viral
reactivations such as rashes, severe organ failures, and permanent loss of hearing and vision.

   In addition to the risks posed by viruses carried from Earth, there is also the possibility of encountering
unknown viruses in space. As we explore further into the cosmos, we may encounter microorganisms we have
never faced before. New microorganisms could lead to the discovery of new valuable and helpful pathogens,
but it also poses a risk if they are harmful.

   To help mitigate the risks, a recent study by researchers using the ISS investigated the evolution of
bacteriophages or phages (viruses that infect and kill potentially harmful bacteria) in microgravity conditions.
The study was groundbreaking in that if phages can mutate in the micro-gravity environment, it could enhance
the phage's ability to attack or limit the bacteria's ability to defend (Howell, 2023). The result is a new
antibiotic that could help keep harmful bacteria subdued during long-distance space travel and increase the
health of astronauts.

   While the threat of viral contamination in space is a significant concern, scientists and space agencies
mitigate these risks through scientific discovery, rigorous sterilization protocols, medical screening, and
research into new antiviral treatments.

                                                      RADIATION

Although radiation is not a threat from biology, prolonged exposure to radiation in space can significantly
affect microorganisms and astronauts. One of the potential consequences is the development of genetic
mutations that could lead to the emergence of new pathogens. The high-energy particles present in space can
damage DNA, leading to changes in the genetic code that can alter the function of proteins and enzymes
(Durante, 2008). These changes can have a range of effects, from benign to harmful, and potentially result in
the emergence of new, pathogenic microorganisms.

   Studies have shown that exposure to ionizing radiation can induce mutations in various microorganisms,
including bacteria and fungi. For example, research has demonstrated that exposure to gamma radiation can
cause mutations in the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) that lead to increased resistance to antibiotics
(Catling, 2014). Other studies have shown that radiation exposure can increase the virulence of specific fungal
pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus (Blachowicz, et al., 2020).

   The potential for radiation-induced mutation to lead to the emergence of new pathogens is a concern for
space exploration, as astronauts are exposed to higher levels of radiation than they would experience on Earth.
Astronauts on long-duration space missions risk developing infections due to weakened immune systems
352 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

caused by prolonged exposure to radiation and other factors (Bijlani, Stephens, Singh, Venkateswaran, &
Wang, 2021). In addition, microorganisms carried on spacecraft or present in space habitats could be exposed
to these high radiation levels.

   While there is still much to learn about the effects of radiation on microorganisms, prolonged exposure to
high radiation levels can induce genetic mutations that could lead to the development of new pathogens. This
underscores the need for careful monitoring and mitigation strategies to minimize the risks associated with
radiation exposure during space exploration.

                                     EXTRATERRESTRIAL PATHOGENS

As space exploration advances, the possibility of encountering extraterrestrial life becomes more likely. While
this may be an exciting prospect, it also presents potential dangers, particularly extraterrestrial pathogens.
These pathogens could pose a significant threat to space travel and the health of astronauts. A primary concern
with extraterrestrial pathogens is that they may be completely unknown to humans. We have yet to learn what
organisms might exist in other worlds or what diseases they might provoke. This lack of knowledge makes
preparing for potential infections and illnesses challenging.

   Furthermore, extraterrestrial pathogens may be able to survive in environments that are hostile to human
life. For example, some bacteria on Earth can survive in extreme temperatures and radiation levels. If similar
organisms exist on other planets, they could infect humans who encounter them. According to one study,
changes in human microbiology due to the conditions of space travel and the adaptation of earth-borne
pathogens to alien environments could also lead to the emergence of modified microorganisms with vastly
different pathogenic potentials (Mihai G. Netea , 2020).

   Another concern is the potential for backward contamination of extraterrestrial pathogens in rock and dust
samples. Carl Woese, a Nobel Prize-nominated biophysicist at the University of Illinois, once stated, "When
the entire biosphere hangs in the balance, it is adventuristic to the extreme to bring Martian life here. Sure,
there is a chance it would not harm; but that is not the point. Unless there is less chance that it might harm,
one should not embark on such a course" (DiGregorio, 2001). Many researchers in the scientific community
believe the odds are low that we would ever find life within our solar system. However, realizing our lack of
understanding about pathogens from other worlds is essential.

   Space agencies must take precautions when exploring other planets and celestial bodies to mitigate these
risks. Samples must be cautiously handled and analyzed to the best of our ability so there are no false
assumptions. Additionally, any samples from other planets must be carefully contained and studied in a secure
laboratory environment. One of the safest ways to protect Earth from extraterrestrial pathogens would be
a quarantine facility placed on the moon. A publication produced by the Lunar and Planetary Institute's
Workshop on Mars Sample Return in 1988 outlined how a facility on the moon would offer "significant
advantages" over other locations (Davidson, 1988). It would offer a form of low gravity, vacuum, distance from
Earth, and accessible communication.

   In conclusion, while discovering extraterrestrial life would be groundbreaking, it also presents potential
hazards in the form of extraterrestrial pathogens. As space exploration continues, we must take precautions to
protect astronauts and Earth from these threats.

IMPACT OF BIOLOGICAL THREATS ON SPACE EXPLORATION

                                      HEALTH RISKS TO ASTRONAUTS

There are several health risks from biological threats that astronauts may encounter during space missions.
These include bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections, allergic reactions, or even extraterrestrial
pathogens. Bacterial infections are a significant concern as they can thrive in the microgravity environment of
spacecraft and become resistant to antibiotics (M A Juergensmeyer, 1999). Viral infections are also a concern
as they can spread rapidly in closed environments such as spacecraft. Fungal infections may also pose a threat
as they can grow on surfaces and equipment within the spacecraft. Allergic reactions to environmental factors
such as dust and pollen may also occur. The possibility of encountering extraterrestrial pathogens is also
possible. However, how our immune system would react to extraterrestrial pathogens and cause health risks is
still being determined.

   The health effects of biological threats on astronauts can range from mild symptoms to severe illness or even
death. Bacterial infections can cause various symptoms, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Viral infections can cause similar symptoms but may lead to respiratory problems and pneumonia. Fungal
infections can cause skin irritations or more severe respiratory problems if inhaled. Allergic reactions can cause
symptoms such as itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing (Ball & Evans, 2001).

   One of the significant health risks associated with biological threats in space is the increased virulence of
microbes due to microgravity conditions. According to a Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews study,
microgravity can alter microbial gene expression, metabolism, and behavior, increasing virulence and antibiotic
resistance (Wilson, 2007). Furthermore, spaceflight has been shown to alter immune function, leading to
increased susceptibility to infections and decreased vaccine efficacy (Crucian, 2015), posing a significant threat
to the health of astronauts, who may be more susceptible to infections while in space.

   To realize the scope of health risks to astronauts, NASA began a three-part investigation of potential disease-
causing microorganisms aboard the International Space Station (ISS) from 2015 to 2021. These studies are
known as the Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1), Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2), and Microbial Tracking-3 (MT-3)
experiments. The MT-1 experiment aimed to study the effects of microgravity on the virulence of microbes
(Lang et al., 2017), while the MT-2 project focused on furthering the research of MT-1 by understanding how
microgravity affects the immune system of astronauts (Urbaniak, 2022). Finally, the MT-3 project expands
on past experiments by studying the response of microbial cells to the spaceflight environment and evaluating
DNA structures for microbes cultured in spaceflight (Gilbert, 2022). All the studies collected samples from
eight different surfaces, including air and water sources, using swabs, filters, and other collection devices.
Samples taken directly from astronauts were also taken during the MT-2 experiment.
354 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

   The MT-1 & MT-2 experiments revealed diverse microbial communities within the ISS environment. The
study identified the potential source of microbial contamination from crew members and cargo shipments.
Most bacteria and fungi detected from surfaces were derived from human skin but became unique due to
the enclosed microgravity environment. The most prominent bacteria and fungi found were Staphylococcus,
Cutibacterium, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Malassezia. These pathogens cause various human health
risks, including food poisoning, respiratory infections, and skin infections. The study also found that the
pathogens had "resistance capabilities against 17 classes of drugs, many of which were broad-spectrum
antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline, all of which are part of
the medical toolkit onboard the ISS" (Urbaniak, 2022). The results of the MT-3 experiments are currently still
in progress.

   Lastly, the possibility of encountering extraterrestrial pathogens has been a topic of interest for scientists and
researchers for many years. The immune system is crucial in defending the host against pathogenic invaders.
However, how our immune system would defend against extraterrestrial pathogens is still being determined.

   One health risk for astronauts is that their immune system may not recognize the extraterrestrial pathogens
as foreign and fail to mount an effective defense. According to the Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, "The
immune system is particular and evolved to recognize and respond to Earth-based pathogens" (Muriel
Gargaud, 2011). It is possible that our immune system will not recognize or have the appropriate defense
against extraterrestrial pathogens due to their unique molecular structures.

   While space exploration has brought us many advancements and discoveries, it poses significant health risks
to astronauts. We do not understand how space travel alters a microbe's ability to adapt in space or what risks
alien organisms could have on astronauts. Continued research studying microbial threats in space is an essential
area of research that can provide valuable insights into its effects on human health.

                              IMPACT ON SPACECRAFT AND EQUIPMENT

One of the most significant threats that impact spacecraft, and its equipment is heavy contamination from
biofilms. Most materials used in spacecraft construction cannot resist biofilm formations and require continual
maintenance and sterilization to prevent formation. These threats can range from a broad assortment of
bacterial and fungal growths presenting failures in essential equipment and dangers to astronauts (Urbaniak,
2022). In this section, we will explore the impacts that biological threats can have on spacecraft and equipment
during space travel.

   Microbial contamination can occur in various ways, such as by introducing bacteria, viruses, or fungi
from Earth or human sources. This contamination can lead to the growth of microorganisms called biofilm
on surfaces within the spacecraft, which can cause corrosive damage to essential equipment and distort the
reliability of tests and other experiments (V.B. Vasin, 1995). According to NASA, biofilms on the Mir space
station and the ISS have been observed clogging air and water purification systems that provide astronaut life
support (Figliozzi, 2013).

   Corrosion is caused by a chemical reaction that occurs when metal or polymers are exposed to oxygen and
moisture. Microorganisms can accelerate corrosion by producing acidic compounds that corrode metal and
plastic surfaces at a higher rate (Lekbach, 2011). This corrosion can weaken equipment and structures within
the spacecraft, potentially leading to equipment failure or structural damage. Aboard the Mir space station,
colonies of organisms were also found growing on "the rubber gaskets around windows, on the components
of space suits, cable insulations, and tubing, on the insulation of copper wires, and communications devices,"
said Andrew Steele, a senior staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington working with other
investigators at Marshall Space Flight Center (Bell, 2004).

   Biological threats can also impact the performance of other electronic equipment within the spacecraft.
Microorganisms can generate electrostatic charges that interfere with electronic signals and disrupt
356 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

communication systems (Chandan K. Sen, 2020). This interference can cause malfunctions in critical systems,
such as life support or navigation systems.

   In conclusion, biological threats pose a significant risk to spacecraft and equipment during space travel.
Contamination, corrosion, and interference with essential systems are just a few examples of the impacts that
these threats can have. Space agencies need to take measures to prevent and mitigate the risks associated with
biological threats to ensure the safety of astronauts and the success of space missions.

ECONOMIC IMPACTS

Space exploration has always been associated with various risks and challenges. A significant concern is
potential biological threats that may arise during space missions. These threats can have severe economic
impacts on space-based programs, affecting the immediate mission and long-term investments in space
exploration. This section explores the economic implications of biological threats in space exploration,
highlighting such risks' potential costs and consequences.

 1. Impact on Mission Costs:

Biological threats in space exploration can significantly impact mission costs. The presence of harmful
microorganisms or pathogens onboard spacecraft can lead to contamination, resulting in a need for extensive
decontamination procedures. These procedures require additional resources, including specialized equipment,
disinfectants, and trained personnel, which can escalate mission costs. Moreover, the delay caused by
decontamination processes may result in missed launch windows and rescheduling, further increasing
expenses.

 2. Investment Uncertainty:

The emergence of biological threats in space exploration introduces uncertainty in future investments.
Potential contamination incidents could lead to public concerns and a loss of confidence in space agencies
or private companies involved in space missions. Investors may hesitate to fund projects due to the perceived
risks associated with biological threats. This uncertainty can hinder the flow of capital into space exploration
programs, limiting their growth and development.

 3. Impact on International Collaboration:

Biological threats in space exploration can strain international collaborations. In case of contamination
incidents involving multiple countries or agencies, disputes may arise regarding responsibility and liability
for the incident. Contamination incidents can lead to strained relationships and hinder future collaborative
                               BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER] | 357

efforts. The breakdown of international partnerships can result in restricted access to shared resources and
expertise, affecting the progress and cost-effectiveness of space exploration missions.

 4. Public Perception and Support:

Biological threats in space exploration can influence public perception and support for space programs.
Contamination incidents can generate adverse publicity, raising concerns about the safety of space missions.
This negative perception may lead to a decline in public support and reduced funding for space exploration
programs. A decrease in public funding could limit the resources available for research, development, and
future missions.

 5. Regulatory Compliance:

The presence of biological threats in space exploration requires adherence to strict regulatory guidelines and
protocols. Space agencies and private companies must comply with international regulations to ensure crew
members' safety, prevent celestial body contamination, and protect Earth's biosphere (Belz, 2005). These
compliance measures add additional costs to space exploration programs, including implementing stringent
sterilization procedures and ongoing monitoring.

   Overall, biological threats in space exploration can have significant economic impacts. The costs associated
with decontamination procedures, investment uncertainty, strained international collaborations, public
perception, support, and regulatory compliance can all contribute to increased expenses and hinder the
progress of space exploration programs.

MITIGATING BIOLOGICAL THREATS IN SPACE

To protect against these potential biological threats, astronauts and scientists must take precautions when
exploring new environments in space. This includes avoiding contact with unknown organisms whenever
possible, sterilization techniques, quarantine measures, and wearing protective clothing whenever necessary.
Additionally, astronauts need to monitor their health closely while in space so that any signs of illness or
infection can be addressed quickly before it becomes a more significant problem for the mission team or other
personnel on board the spacecraft.

                                         STERILIZATION TECHNIQUES

Sterilization is crucial in space missions to prevent contamination of extraterrestrial environments with
terrestrial microorganisms. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) continuously
358 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

utilizes and develops various sterilization techniques to ensure that spacecraft and equipment sent to space are
free of viable microorganisms. This section will discuss the different sterilization techniques used in modern
space missions.

   One of the approved sterilization techniques is dry heat sterilization. This method involves subjecting
equipment to temperatures ranging from 160°C to 180°C for several hours. The high temperature kills all
microorganisms, including bacterial endospores, and ensures that no viable organisms remain on the spacecraft
(Belz et al., 2005).

   Another widely used technique is chemical sterilization. This method involves using chemicals such as
hydrogen peroxide or ethylene oxide to kill microorganisms instead of heating thermally sensitive electronics
and hardware materials. Vapor phase hydrogen peroxide (VHP) is an alternative sterilization technique where
equipment is placed in a sealed chamber with a vacuum, and the chemical is introduced into the chamber and
kills all microorganisms present (Chen et al., 2013).

   Finally, ultraviolet (U.V.) radiation is another method of sterilizing surfaces and equipment. The system
is based on the Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) method of disinfection, where U.V. light, at
sufficiently short wavelengths, is used to damage the DNA of microorganisms, rendering them unable to
reproduce and kill microorganisms. However, this method is less effective against bacterial endospores (Eagan
& Ridinger, 2017).

   In closing, sterilization is critical in modern space missions to prevent contamination of extraterrestrial
environments with terrestrial microorganisms. NASA has developed various sterilization techniques,
including dry heat sterilization, chemical sterilization, and U.V. radiation. New sterilization techniques are
being researched and will be used in future missions.

                                            QUARANTINE MEASURES

Quarantine measures are essential in space travel and on Earth to avoid the lethality of alien biological threats.
The risk of contamination from extraterrestrial life forms is a genuine concern for space agencies. To mitigate
these risks, quarantine measures are implemented to prevent contamination from alien and earth-born
biological threats. Quarantine measures include isolation procedures, decontamination processes, and strict
crew health monitoring. There are several types of quarantine measures used for space travel:

  · Pre-flight quarantine involves isolating astronauts from the general population before launch to prevent
      the spread of illness or infection.

  · In-flight quarantine: includes isolating astronauts from each other and the rest of the spacecraft to
      prevent the spread of disease.

  · Post-flight quarantine measures: isolating astronauts after returning to Earth to ensure they are not
      carrying harmful pathogens.

  · Emergency quarantine procedures are designed to be implemented quickly in case of a medical
                               BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER] | 359

      emergency or disease outbreak on board a spacecraft. Emergency quarantine procedures may involve
      isolating affected individuals, decontaminating the spacecraft, or even aborting the mission if necessary.
      Isolation may be voluntary or involuntary, depending on the circumstances. Personal protective
      equipment (PPE) or Biological Isolation Garments have also been used to isolate an individual or be
      used by others to protect themselves (Dasch & O'Mara, 2018).

The primary quarantine measure is using a quarantine facility upon return to Earth. In 1964, federal officials
and scientists assembled to discuss the possibility that microbes from the Moon or other worlds could
potentially contaminate the Earth. Dr. Carl Sagan argued that lunar travelers might bring deadly organisms
back with them that could theoretically destroy life on Earth (Carter, 2001). Congress shortly realized that
rigorous quarantine protocols were needed to isolate astronauts, spacecraft, and lunar samples to prevent
back-contamination from any possible lunar microorganisms into Earth's biosphere. Congress authorized
NASA to build the specially designed Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL) in Houston, where returning
astronauts, their spacecraft and all the samples of lunar material could be kept in strict quarantine and tested
to determine if they posed a threat to the planet (Mars, 2021). The facility was completed in 1967 and was
equipped with specialized air filtration systems, sealed dormitories, vacuum systems, a rare gas analysis system,
a physical-chemical test area, vacuum glove boxes, and the radiation counting laboratory that was built 50 feet
underground (Uri, 2021). Biological monitoring was also an essential part of the quarantine process. Samples
of air, water, and surfaces within the laboratory were regularly tested for any signs of microbial growth or other
contaminants. All waste products and equipment were also heavily sterilized before entering and leaving the
facility.

   Quarantine measures administered in the LRL were taken seriously. In a recent article by Dagomar Degroot,
he explains, "LRL technicians agreed that if they were exposed to lunar contaminants and quarantined, they
would not attempt to escape. If exposure killed them, their relatives could not claim their bodies. Rough plans
drafted by NASA officials imagined that guards would seal the facility at gunpoint in case of a dangerous
breach of lunar organisms that threatened to spill beyond the LRL. If all else failed, the entire facility and
everyone inside it would be buried under a mountain of dirt and concrete (Scoles, 2023).

   As space exploration advances, new quarantine measures must be developed to address new challenges.
For example, future missions to Mars or other planets may require more extended periods of isolation and
more extensive decontamination procedures due to the risk of contaminating these planets with Earth-based
microbes (Keith, 2021). Modern policies are frequently being developed by the Committee on Space Research
(COSPAR) and their special Panel of Planetary Protection, whose primary objective is to develop, maintain,
and promote the COSPAR policy and "to protect against the harmful effects of forward and backward
contamination" (European Space Agency, 2023). Modernized facilities are also being constructed. In 2017,
NASA's Johnson Space Center unveiled Building 21, home of the Human Health and Performance
Laboratory. Additionally, new technologies such as 3D printing and autonomous robots may reduce the risk
of contamination by minimizing human contact with potentially contaminated surfaces.
360 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

USE OF PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

Modern space missions require protective equipment against biological threats to ensure the safety of
astronauts and prevent the spread of harmful microorganisms. The use of protective equipment has become
increasingly important as space exploration expands, and missions become longer. In this section, we will
discuss the types of protective equipment used in modern space missions and how they are utilized to protect
against biological threats.

   One of the primary forms of protective equipment used in space missions is the spacesuit. Spacesuits are
designed to provide a sealed environment for astronauts, protecting them from the vacuum of space, extreme
temperatures, and harmful radiation. In addition to these hazards, spacesuits also protect against biological
threats. Spacesuits are equipped with air filters that remove contaminants from the air before astronauts
breathe it in (NASA, 2023). The suits are also made from materials resistant to microbial growth, preventing
harmful bacteria or virus accumulation.

   Another form of protective equipment used in space missions is personal protective equipment (PPE).
PPE includes items such as gloves, masks, and gowns that are worn by astronauts when managing potentially
hazardous materials. PPE is essential for preventing the spread of harmful microorganisms between crew
members or back to Earth (NASA, 2021). PPE is also used during medical procedures or experiments involving
biological samples.

   In addition to spacesuits and PPE, spacecraft are equipped with environmental control systems (ECS) that
help maintain a clean and sterile environment. ECS systems filter and purify the air inside spacecraft, removing
contaminants that could threaten crew members (National Research Council; Division on Engineering and
Physical Sciences; Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems; Committee on Advanced Technology
for Human Support in Space, 1997). These systems also regulate temperature and humidity levels to prevent
the growth of microbes.

   To further protect against biological threats, NASA and the COSPAR Panel on Planetary Protection
have implemented strict protocols for overseeing biological samples and conducting experiments involving
living organisms. These protocols include sterilization procedures for equipment and surfaces and quarantine
measures for crew members returning from space (NASA et al., 2020).

   In conclusion, modern space missions require various protective equipment to ensure the safety of
astronauts and prevent the spread of harmful microorganisms. Spacesuits, PPE, ECS systems, and strict
protocols for managing biological samples are essential to modern space exploration.

FUTURE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH

                                THE ROLE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

Space exploration has always been a subject of great interest for scientists and researchers. As humans venture
farther into space, it becomes crucial to understand and overcome the challenges posed by extended periods
of space travel. One area that holds immense potential is advanced biological technologies. By harnessing the
power of biology, scientists can develop innovative solutions to ensure the well-being and sustainability of
astronauts during long-duration missions. This section examines several advancements in biotechnology that
enable the further development of innovative solutions for sustaining life in space.

 1. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats): is a gene-editing tool that
      allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA sequences. It has revolutionized the field of genetics
      and has numerous applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. In 2017, a team of scientists
      launched the Genes in Space-3 mission to study the effects of microgravity on DNA using a MinION
      CRISPR device. The researchers used CRISPR to edit specific genes in the DNA samples and then
      sequenced the edited DNA to see if microgravity caused any changes. The experiment results showed
      that microgravity did not cause significant changes in DNA sequences compared to earth-based
      experiments (Sarah Stahl-Rommel, 2021). This opened a significant door for the future use of CRISPR
      technology for space exploration.

Using CRISPR technology in space has significant implications for future space exploration and colonization.
It could be used to genetically engineer plants and animals to withstand the harsh conditions of space or to treat
genetic diseases in astronauts. However, there are ethical concerns about using gene-editing technology in space
and the potential risks and consequences. A common concern is the potential for unintended consequences.
Gene editing is a relatively new technology, and much is still unknown about its long-term effects. It is possible
that genetic modifications made for space travel could have unintended consequences that are not apparent
until years or even decades later (William, 2022).

   However, the Genes in Space-3 experiment demonstrated the feasibility of using CRISPR technology to
study DNA mutations in microgravity. It opens new avenues for genetics research and has potential space
exploration and colonization applications.

 2. Synthetic phages: Synthetic phages are genetically engineered viruses designed to target specific bacteria
      strains by modifying their genetic material. Their ability to combat bacterial infections makes them a
      promising tool against serious threats posed by drug-resistant bacterial infections during long-duration
      space missions. Phages have been used as a natural alternative to antibiotics for decades; however,
      synthetic modifications allow phages to recognize and destroy specific bacteria while leaving beneficial
      microorganisms unharmed.
362 | BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER]

Numerous research efforts are underway to develop synthetic phages for space exploration. Scientists are
focusing on improving their efficacy, stability, and delivery methods. Additionally, the "Phage-Evolution"
study is currently being conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) to understand the impact of
microgravity on synthetic phage performance (NASA, 2020).

 3. Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and Autonomous Systems: A.I. has emerged as a powerful tool in
      various fields, including space exploration and mitigating biological threats. The ability of A.I. systems
      to analyze vast amounts of data, make autonomous decisions, and adapt to changing environments
      makes them invaluable in space exploration domains. Robotics are also crucial for performing complex
      tasks in space exploration. From sample collection and analysis to remote sensing, maintenance,
      teleoperation, and planetary exploration, robots play a vital role in ensuring the safety of astronauts. A.I.
      coupled with robotics (autonomous systems) can push robotics further, perform experiments, repair
      equipment, and even assist astronauts. The use of autonomous systems reduces human risk while
      enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of space missions.

According to NASA, trusted autonomy within autonomous systems is a critical technology area necessary for
the future of human and robotic space exploration (Bryan, 2020). A.I. has the potential to play a crucial role
in combating biological threats in space but must be as dependable and capable as a human. By leveraging
autonomous systems, scientists and researchers can enhance their ability to detect, analyze, and respond to
threats without ever putting a human at risk. A.I. can be utilized to develop advanced algorithms that can
quickly identify and classify various pathogens, monitor the spread of diseases, and predict their potential
impact within a closed-loop system on space missions (Sanders, 2023). Furthermore, A.I. can aid in developing
autonomous systems capable of performing medical procedures and administering treatments in space
environments.

   A workshop organized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and modeling applications in 2023 shared that a central goal of developing and employing
autonomous, AI-supported bio-experimentation systems such as self-driving laboratories should be to
generate longitudinal data (Sanders, 2023). The data gathered could inform autonomous health systems that
provide decision support for crew health management during space missions.

 4. Digital to Biological Converters: DBCs are innovative devices that convert biological sequence
      information from a transmitter location into biological material at a receiving unit. The system also has
      an assembly unit connected to the receiving unit, and the assembly unit assembles the biological entity
      according to the biological sequence information (Gill, 2021). DBCs utilize synthetic biology
      techniques to encode digital data into DNA sequences, which can then be synthesized and expressed in
      living organisms. This technology enables storing and retrieving vast amounts of information in a
      biologically stable format. DBCs can also be engineered to detect specific genetic signatures associated
                               BIOLOGICAL THREATS AND GROWTH IN SPACE [SINCAVAGE & MUEHLFELDER & CARTER] | 363

      with known pathogens or harmful organisms. By leveraging their ability to convert digital information
      into biological material, DBCs enable rapid and targeted detection of potential threats.

The key to the technology is that the transmitting or receiving units can be present at remote locations on
Earth (Gill, 2021). This presents itself to be a valuable application to space exploration. For example, if an
autonomous system collects a sample that contains life on another planet, its biological sequence could be
analyzed, digitalized, then sent to a receiving unit via broadcast on Earth, and the assembly unit could build
the lifeform synthetically in a safe environment on Earth. This would eliminate variables within the transfer
of the organism, such as cost, travel time, and exposure issues. On the other hand, if a receiving and assembly
unit were available on a Mars colony, the DBC could digitally transmit a valuable protein as a vaccine sequence
from Earth (Gill, 2021).

 5. Quantum Computing: Quantum computing utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to perform
      computations. Unlike classical computers that use bits to represent information as either a 0 or 1,
      quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to a phenomenon
      called superposition (Giles, 2019). This property allows quantum computers to simultaneously process
      vast amounts of information, leading to exponential computational power. In recent years, researchers
      have explored the potential applications of quantum computing in various fields, including space
      exploration.

Quantum computers have the potential to significantly enhance data processing capabilities significantly,
enabling faster analysis of large datasets. In the context of biological threat detection, this facilitates the
rapid identification and analysis of pathogens or biological agents that pose risks to astronauts during space
missions. Quantum computing can also provide robust simulation and modeling tools for predicting the
behavior of biological threats in space environments. By simulating the interactions between pathogens and
various environmental factors, scientists can gain insights into how these threats may evolve and adapt in
space conditions (Giles, 2019). Quantum machine learning algorithms can improve the accuracy and speed of
pattern recognition, enabling the detection of subtle biological threat indicators in large datasets (Ahsan, Luna,
& Siddique, 2022). This can aid in identifying and mitigating potential risks during space exploration missions.

   Quantum computing holds great promise for detecting and mitigating biological threats during space
exploration. Its ability to process vast amounts of data, simulate complex systems, optimize designs, and
enhance pattern recognition can revolutionize our ability to safeguard astronauts from potential biological
hazards. However, further research and development are required to overcome technical challenges and realize
the full potential of quantum computing in this domain.

CONCLUSIONS

Advanced biological technologies hold immense potential for space exploration. Today, serious researchers
who devote energy to assessing realistic threats may consider advanced technology's unrecognized but
revolutionary evolution (Sincavage & McCreight, 2019). Understanding the effects of space travel on human
physiology is crucial for developing effective countermeasures. Utilizing autonomous systems supported by
A.I. could pave the way for creating sufficient environments before humans set foot on other worlds.
Advancements in biotechnology that enable genetic modifications that enhance an organism's adaptability
to space environments could create advanced life support for long-duration missions. Bio-generative support
using digitally transmitted systems offers a sustainable solution for long-duration missions. By harnessing the
power of biology, scientists can pave the way for successful and sustainable space exploration.

SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

PURVIEW

Space is the entire physical universe. Outer Space is all of the Space outside the Earth. Deep Space is the vast
distance of Space far away from a reference point or observer. (What is Deep Space, 2023) For our purposes, let
us redefine Space as the new frontier of Electronic Warfare (EW), Intelligence, and Reconnaissance (EWIR).
For purposes of this chapter and Chapter 10, we have three general altitude reference points: 1) Earth's surface
(ground zero); 2) The maximum distance to Geosynchronous and Geostationary Satellites from the Earth's
surface(22,236 mi); and 3) Deep Space beyond the maximum altitude for Satellites (>22,236 mi). (High Earth
Orbit, 2023)

   Of the three EWIR, our concern is with EW. However, EW alone is a huge discipline and encompasses many
different sciences. Chapter 3 Book 7 (Nichols & al, Space Systems: Emerging Technologies and Operations,
2022) focused on space electronic warfare, signal jamming, and spoofing. Jamming was presented only as a
precursor attack to a spoofing attack. In addition to the basics presented in Chapter 3, Book 7 (Nichols R.
&., 2022), there are plenty of learning seminars available by SMEs like Rhode & Schwartz and fundamental
textbooks to inform the reader. (Wolff, 2022) (Adamy D. , 2001) (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare,
2021) (Adamy D. L., EW 104: EW against a new generation of threats, 2015) (Adamy D. L., EW 103: Tactical
Battlefield Communications Electronic Warfare, 2009) (Adamy D. L., EW 102 A Second Course in Electronic
Warfare, 2004)[1] [2] On Linkedin, visit Paul Szymanski, an SME author who teaches expert courses for
Space Warfighters. Rhode and Schwartz in Munich, Germany, provides advanced courses in Radar, EW, and
various synchronous topics. Similarly, there is a plethora of Open-Source information on Intelligence and
Reconnaissance functions. They are the menu and dessert of the intelligence community (IC) -especially
related to UAS/CUAS/UUV systems. (Nichols & Sincavage, 2022)

OBJECTIVES

Chapter 10 is about EW, signals, and vulnerable communication links. Chapter 10 is a condensed treatment of
the subjects addressed in fair detail in our published UAS/CUAS/UUV/Space series Book 7, Chapter 3: Space
Systems: Emerging Technologies and Operations. (Nichols & al, Space Systems: Emerging Technologies and
Operations, 2022) Chapter 3 was entitled: Space Electronic Warfare, Jamming, Spoofing, and ECD (Nichols R.
&., 2022). Chapter 3 covered in detail the principles of space electronic warfare:
374 | SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

  · Key definitions in EW, satellite systems, and ECD countermeasures
  · A look at space calculations and satellite threats using plane and spherical trigonometry to explain orbital

      mechanics
  · A brief review of EMS, signals, RADAR, Acoustic, and UAS Stealth principles,
  · Signals to/from satellites and their vulnerabilities to Interception, Jamming, and Spoofing
  · Promising ECD technology countermeasures to spoofing can detect, mitigate, and recover fake and

      genuine signals. (Eichelberger, 2019)

EW definitions from Book 7, Chapter 3 are incorporated in this book's Abbreviations and Acronyms section.
dB math and spherical trigonometry concepts, the bread and butter of EW, are presented as a primer in
Appendix A. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) presents detailed mathematical concepts
fundamental to space electronic warfare calculations.

   Chapter 10 focuses on three types of EW signal activities: Interception, Jamming, and Spoofing. It looks at
vulnerable satellite links and threats to those links. It presents a controllable region and prepares for discussing
the uncontrollable deep space region covered in chapter 12.

ORBITAL MECHANICS - THE LANGUAGE OF THE SKIES

To understand satellite functions, velocity, and locations in real-time, we use an interesting geometric
mathematics known as Orbital Mechanics.

   Spherical and Elliptical geometry are used to explain Orbital Mechanics. The difficulty trying to understand
Spherical Triangles versus Plane Triangles is because Spherical Triangles are 2-dimensional, mapped onto a
sphere rather than a plane. An example would be looking at a map and drawing a line from one point to the
other, but in reality, the Space between is actually curved. Spherical Trigonometry takes the curvature of the
Earth into account. This mapping is defined/known as the Keplerian Ephemeris. The Ephemeris elements of
Spherical Triangles can be seen in Table 10-1 and Figure 10-1.

376 | SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

From the orbital elements, it is possible to compute the position and velocity of the satellite.
Kepler's Third Law states that the relationship between the size of the orbit and its period is defined by:

               a3 = CP2; therefore, C = a3/ P2.              Eq. 10-1

Where:

a = the semi-major axis of the orbit ellipse,

C = a constant, and

P = the orbit period.

Example: If a Satellite circles the Earth every 1.5 hours and has an altitude of 281.4-km-high (or a radius

from the center of the Earth of 6,653 km, then C is calculated as; 6,653 km3/90 min2 = 36,355.285 km per

min2

     Table 10-2 Shows the altitude of a circular Earth satellite versus the period of its orbit for
                              satellites with periods of 1.5 hours to 9 hours.

LOOK ANGLES

An Earth Trace is the locus of latitude and longitude of the SVP as the satellite moves through its orbit. Note: The
SVP is the point on the Earth's surface directly below the satellite. This point intersects the line from the center
of the Earth to the satellite with the surface of the Earth. LEO (low earth orbits) determines the moment-to-
moment area of the Earth that the satellite sees. It also allows us to calculate the look angles and range of the
satellite from a specified point on (or above) the Earth at any specified time. See Figure 10-3.

   Using the six elements of Ephemeris, the exact location of a satellite can be calculated at any time. For
example, the Earth Trace of a satellite with a 90-minute orbital period will move West by 22.56 longitude
degrees for each subsequent orbit. Example: (90-minute orbital Period / 1463 sidereal day, minutes) x 360
deg = 22.56 deg. Earth Traces are very important in using emerging space technologies for humanitarian
purposes. They give policymakers new approaches to feeding populations, increasing crop efficiencies, routing
navigation, improving cattle feeding, and building more effective fire barriers. (Nichols & al, Space Systems:
Emerging Technologies and Operations, 2022)

   Where: (SVP = Sub-vehicle point) and is the intersection of a line from the center of the Earth to the satellite
with the Earth's surface
   The Earth area over which a satellite can send or receive signals to and from the Earth-based stations during
each orbit depends on the satellite's altitude and the beam width and orientation of antennas on the satellite. If
a satellite is placed in polar orbit, its orbit has 90 inclination and will, therefore, eventually provide complete
coverage of the surface of the Earth.

        Figure 10-4 Earth Trace of a satellite is the path of the SVP over the Earth's surface in an
                                                    equatorial view.

   A synchronous satellite has an SVP that stays in one location on the Earth's surface. This requires that its
orbital period be one sidereal day (i.e., 1,436 minutes). Another requirement for a fixed SVP is that the orbit
has an 0° inclination. That would place it directly on the border.
   Figure 10-5 shows a sample calculation of the range of a synchronous satellite based on a semi-major axis of
42,166 km. "In a circular orbit, the satellite's height will be 35,795 km. The maximum range can be calculated
from the Earth's surface station (ESS) to the synchronous satellite with a circular orbit. The diagram is a
planer triangle in the plane containing the Earth's ESS, satellite, and center. The ESS sees the satellite at 0 deg
elevation. The minimum and maximum range values for the satellite to the ground link are 35,795 km and
41,682 km. The shorter range applies if the satellite is directly overhead, and the maximum range is for the
satellite to the horizon as shown." (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)

     Figure 10-5 Example calculation: Maximum range to a synchronous satellite on the horizon is
     41,759 km by Kepler's Laws. Link loss for a 2 GHz signal would be from 189.5 to 190.9 dB

LOCATION OF THREAT TO SATELLITE
The location of a threat from the satellite is defined in terms of the azimuth and elevation of a vector from the
satellite that points at the threat location and the range between the satellite and the threat. The vector points
information for a satellite antenna aimed at the threat. An EW system on the satellite will either intercept
signals from a threat transmitter or transmit jamming or spoofing signals to a threat receiver at the considered
location. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) (Nichols R. &., 2022) See Figure 10-6.

   Figure 10-6 The azimuth and elevation angle from the nadir defines the direction of a threat to a
                                                         satellite.
                                                                                                   SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS] | 381

   Source: Courtesy of (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)
   Where: the azimuth is the angle between true North and the threat location in a plane at the satellite
perpendicular to the vector from the SVP. The elevation is the angle between the SVP and the threat. The nadir
is defined as the point on the celestial sphere directly below an observer.
CALCULATING LOOK ANGLES
For the azimuth calculation, we need to consider the spherical triangle. Consider Figures 10-7 and 10-8.

       Figure 10-7 A spherical triangle is formed between the North Pole, the SVP, and the Threat
                                                         location.
382 | SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

Source: Courtesy of (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)

   The elevation from the nadir and range to a threat from a satellite can be determined from the plane triangle
defined by the satellite, the threat, and the center of the Earth. For example, Set E is at the satellite, F is at
the threat, and G is at the center of the Earth. Side e is the radius of the Earth (6,371 km). Side f is the semi-
major axis (the radius of the Earth plus the satellite altitude = 10,560 km), angle G is side a from the spherical
triangle above (21.57°), and side g is the propagation distance between the satellite and the threat. We use the
law of cosines for plane triangles to calculate the relationships - specifically the propagation distance between
the satellite and the threat; to wit:

g2 = e2 + f2 - 2ef cos(G)                                          Eq. 10-2

Figure 10-8 The elevation from the nadir and range to a threat from a satellite can be determined
       from the plane triangle defined by the satellite, threat, and the center of the Earth.

PROPAGATION LOSS MODELS

   Messages travel (propagate) through Space as radio waves (electromagnetic waves). This is similar to the
radio waves we receive with our car radio. Each spacecraft has a transmitter and receiver for radio waves and a
way of interpreting the information received and acting on it. Electromagnetic waves are unlike sound waves
because they do not need molecules to travel. This means electromagnetic waves can travel through air, solid
objects, and Space. This is how astronauts on spacewalks use radios to communicate.

   Space wave propagation refers to the satellite signals of radio transmitted freely through the Earth's
atmosphere. Space wave propagation refers to the radio waves transmitted from the antenna to propagate
(travel) along Space to reach the receiver antenna.

   It is not a clean transmission because of the long distances to satellites. There are losses in the link between
the antenna and the receiver. (R.K. Nichols & Lekkas, 2002)

   (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) presents several propagation loss models within the
atmosphere based on a clear or obstructed path and Fresnel zone distance. Refer to Table 10-3. These models
384 | SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

are LOS (free space loss or spreading loss), two-ray propagation for phase cancellation, and KED (knife-edge
loss). Adamy also considers atmospheric, rain, and fog losses.

RECEIVED POWER AT THE RECEIVER

When radio transmission and propagation is to or from an Earth satellite, there are special considerations due
to the nature of Space, losses due to extreme long range, and the geometry of the links. The 10-3 formula gives
the received power to the receiver:

        PR = ERP - L + GR                                    Eq. 10-3

Where:

PR- received signal power in dBm

ERP- the effective radiated power, in dBm

L - losses from all causes between transmitting and receiving antennas in dBm

GR - receiver antenna gain in dBm

   The total path loss to or from a satellite includes LOS loss, atmospheric loss, antenna misalignment loss,
polarization loss, and rain loss. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) [3]

ONE-WAY LINK EQUATION

The one-way link equation gives the received power PR in terms of the other link components (in decibel
units). It is:

        PR = PT + GT - L + GR                                                  Eq. 10-4

Where:
PR - received signal power in dBm
PT - transmitter output power in dBm
GT - transmitter antenna gain in dBm
L - link losses from all causes as a positive number in dBm
GR - receiver antenna gain in dBm

In linear (non-decibel units), this formula is:
PR = ( PT GT GR ) / L  SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS] | 387

                                       Eq. 10-5

   It is assumed that all link losses from propagation are between isotropic antennas (unity gain, 0-dB gain).
(Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)

INTERCEPTED COMMUNICATION SIGNAL

When a communication signal is intercepted, there are two links to consider: the transmitter to intercept the
receiver link and the transmitter to desired receiver link. Refer to Figure 10-9.

JAMMED / SPOOFED COMMUNICATIONS SIGNAL
When a communication signal is jammed or spoofed, there is a link from the desired transmitter to the receiver
and a link from a jammer or spoofer to the receiver. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) [4] Refer
to Figure 10-10.

SATELLITE LINKS

Satellites are, by nature, remote from the ground and must be connected by links. Uplink and downlink geometry
is a complex set of calculations related to satellite position, North Pole, longitudes, latitudes, sub-vehicle
points (SVP), Center of Earth, ground station, Equator, Greenwich Meridian, Azimuth to the ground station,
satellite movement in the horizontal plane, satellite payloads, radar bore sights, and hostile target detection, all
wrapped up in complex orbital and spherical geometry calculations. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare,
2021) spends four challenging chapters on this subject.

   Uplinks have transmitters on or near Earth's surface and receivers in the satellite. The uplink equation is
10-4. L is the in that equation is Link Losses. Table 10-4 shows the various Uplink Losses.

   Command links control functions of the satellite, such as its orientation, payloads, and synchronization of
multiple payloads. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)

   Intercept links (satellite-borne system) are defined from the hostile transmitter to the satellite payload
receiver

   The power received by the satellite payload receiver in the presence of a hostile transmitter is given by
equation 10-6:

PR = PT + GT - Link Losses + GR                                       Eq. 10-6

Where:
PR - Power received by satellite payload receiver
PT - Hostile transmitter output power
GT - Boresight gain of the hostile transmitter
Link Losses - Table 10-4
GR - Boresight gain of satellite payload receiving antenna

   Downlinks from the satellite to the ground can be the satellite's control station, to other receivers at
stations that require information that the satellite has gathered, or to hostile receivers that intercept the satellite
downlink. They can also be to hostile receivers that are jammed or spoofed from the satellite. (Adamy D. L.,
EW 103: Tactical Battlefield Communications Electronic Warfare, 2009) (Nichols R. &., 2022)

The downlink equation is given by 10-7.

                         PR = PT + GT - Link Losses + GR              Eq. 10-7
Where:
PR - Power received by the ground-based receiver or hostile receiver
PT - Output power of the satellite's transmitter
GT - Boresight gain of satellite's antenna

   User data links - a satellite may collect usage data for many users. User data links receive satellite data directly.
Users may not be authorized to receive all the data available /collected from /by the satellite. The ground
station may edit the data and retransmitted back to the satellite and back again to users. (Adamy D. L., Space
Electronic Warfare, 2021)

   Jamming Links - ground communication links and satellite radar links can be jammed. The target receiver
can either be on the Earth's surface or in an aircraft or UAS flying above the Earth. Like intercept links, the
received power into the target receiver is calculated by the same formula. Still, the transmitted power is from
the satellite jammer, and the received power is at the target receiver.

The Jammed link equation is given by 10-8.

LINK VULNERABILITY TO EW: SPACE-RELATED LOSSES, INTERCEPT JAMMING &
SPOOFING

Satellites are from Earth but present excellent loss of signal (LOS) from a large part of the Earth's surface.
As reported previously, satellite links are highly susceptible to three kinds of hostile activity. Signals from
satellites can be intercepted, and strong hostile transmissions can be jamming signals, interfering with uplink
or downlink signals to prevent proper reception. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) They can
also be spoofing signals that cause the satellite to interpret them as functional commands that are harmful
or transmit useless positional data. This section and the following will focus heavily on spoofing and the
downlink interpretation of false signals in GNSS/GPS/ADS-B receivers. (Nichols R. &., 2022)

   Figure 10-11 shows a successful intercept of a satellite signal. Successful intercept gives the hostile receiver
a high-quality signal to recover important information. A ground-based jammer operating against a satellite
uplink transmits to the link receiver in the satellite. The ground station and the jammer must be above the
horizon from the satellite. The received signals are intended for the receiver in the satellite control station
(GCS) or another authorized receiver. There is a separate link to any hostile receiver. (Adamy D. L., EW
103: Tactical Battlefield Communications Electronic Warfare, 2009) (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare,
2021)

   Successful spoofing places a strong enough signal into a satellite link receiver to cause the satellite or its
payload to accept it as a valid command. Command spoofing could cause the satellite to perform a maneuver
that ends the mission or put the payload in an unusable state. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)
(Nichols R. &., 2022)

   Figure 10-12 shows a successful spoofing of a satellite signal. A ground-based spoofer operating against a
satellite uplink transmits to the link receiver in the satellite. The ground station and the jammer must be above
the horizon from the satellite.[5]

SPACE-RELATED LINK LOSSES

Any attack on a satellite link may involve single or multiple links. Each link is subject to transmission losses,
including LOS, atmospheric, antenna misalignment, rain, and polarization losses.

   An intercept link is separate from the intended command and data links. It goes from the satellite's link
transmitter (onboard or at GCS) to a hostile receiver. The quality of the intercept is judged by the Signal to
Noise (S/N) ratio achieved in the hostile receiver. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)

   A spoofing link goes from the hostile transmitter to a satellite link receiver. This receiver is generally on the
satellite. The spoofing signal's purpose is to cause it to function improperly, but if the spoofer is in the GCS,
the purpose is to invalidate the data - especially localization data. (Nichols R. &., 2022) (Adamy D. L., EW
104: EW against a new generation of threats, 2015)

   Jamming of any satellite link is communications jamming. Jamming effectiveness is defined in terms of the
Jamming-to-Signal ratio (J/S) that it causes. It is calculated from the following formula:

                    J / S = ERPJ - ERPS - LOSSJ + LOSSS + GRJ - GR Eq. 10-9
Where:
J / S = Jamming-to-signal ratio in decibels
ERPJ = Effective radiated power (ERP) of jamming transmitter toward the target receiver in dBm
ERPS = ERP of the desired signal toward the receiver in dBm
LOSSJ = Transmission loss from the jammer to target a receiver in dBm
LOSSS = Transmission loss from transmitter to target a receiver in decibels
GRJ = Gain of receiving antenna in the direction of a jammer in decibels
GR = Gain of receiving antenna toward transmitter in decibels

   The last two terms cancel each other if the target receiver has a non-directional antenna.
   (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) in his textbook, he presents and solves detailed examples of
intercepting, jamming, and spoofing uplinks and downlinks. [6] [7]

GPS/GNSS SPOOFING -PRACTICAL SPOOFING

GPS spoofing detection and mitigation for GNSS / GPS using the ECD algorithm will be addressed. GPS
spoofing of ADS-B systems was covered in detail (Nichols R. &., 2022).[8] Recognize that ADS-B is a
subset of the larger receiver localization problem. Solutions that apply to the larger vector space,
GNSS / GPS, also are valid for the subset, ADS-B, if computational hardware is available. GPS
spoofing is a reasonably well-researched topic. Many methods have been proposed to detect and mitigate
spoofing. The lion's share of the research focuses on detecting spoofing attacks. Methods of spoofing
mitigation are often specialized or computationally burdensome. Civilian COTS anti-spoofing
394 | SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

countermeasures are rare. Nevertheless, much better technology is available to Detect, Mitigate and
Recover Spoofed satellite signals - even those with a precursor Jamming attack. It is called ECD.

ECD: EICHELBERGER COLLECTIVE DETECTION

This section covers the brilliant value-added research by Dr. Manuel Eichelberger on the detection, mitigation,
and recovery of GPS-spoofed signals. (Eichelberger, 2019) ECD implementation and evaluation show that
with some modifications, the robustness of collective detection (CD) can be exploited to mitigate spoofing attacks.
(Eichelberger, 2019) shows that multiple locations, including the actual one, can be recovered from scenarios where
several signals are present. [9] [10]

   ECD does not track signals. It works with signal snapshots. It is suitable for snapshot receivers, a new low-
power GPS receiver class. (M. Eichelberger, 2019) (J. Liu & et.al., 2012)

SPOOFING

Threats and weaknesses show that large damages (even fatal or catastrophic) can be caused by transmitting
forged GPS signals. False signal generators may cost only a few hundred dollars of software and hardware.
(Humphreys & al., 2008)

   A GPS receiver computing its location wrongly or even failing to estimate any location at all can have
different causes. Wrong localization solutions come from 1) a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal
(examples: inside a building or below trees in a canyon), 2) reflected signals in multipath scenarios, or 3)
deliberately spoofed signals. (Eichelberger, 2019) discusses mitigating low SNR and multipath reflected
signals. Signal spoofing (#3) is the most difficult case since the attacker can freely choose the signal power and
delays for each satellite individually. (Eichelberger, 2019)

   Before discussing ECD - Collective detection maximum likelihood localization approach (Eichelberger, 2019),
it is best to step back and briefly discuss GPS signals, classical GPS receivers, A-GPS, and snapshot receivers.
Then the ECD approach to spoofing will show some real power by comparison. Power is defined as both
enhanced spoofing detection and mitigation capabilities. [11]

GPS SIGNAL

The GPS consists of control, space, and user segments. The space segment contains 24 orbiting satellites. The
network monitor stations, GCS, and antennas comprise the control segment. The third and most important
are the receivers, which comprise the user segment. (USGPO, 2021)

   Satellites transmit signals in different frequency bands. These include the L1 and L2 frequency bands
                                                                                                   SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS] | 395

at 1.57542 GHz and 1.2276 GHz. (DoD, 2008) Signals from different satellites may be distinguished and
extracted from background noise using code division multiple access protocols (CDMA). (DoD, 2008) Each
satellite has a unique course/acquisition code (C/A) of 1023 bits. The C/A codes are PRN sequences
transmitted at 10.23 MHz, which repeats every millisecond. The C /A code is merged using an XOR before
being with the L1 or L2 carrier. The data broadcast has a timestamp called HOW, which is used to compute
the location of the satellite when the packet was transmitted. The receiver needs accurate orbital information
( aka Ephemeris) about the satellite, which changes over time. The timestamp is broadcast every six seconds;
the ephemeris data can only be received if the receiver can decode at least 30 seconds of the signal.[12]
(Eichelberger, 2019)

CLASSIC RECEIVERS

Classical GPS receivers use three stages when obtaining a location fix. They are Acquisition, Tracking, and
localization.

   Acquisition. The relative speed between the satellite and receiver introduces a significant Doppler shift to
the carrier frequency. [13] GPS receiver locates the set of available satellites. This is achieved by correlating the
received signal with the satellites'. Since satellites move at considerable speeds. The signal frequency is affected
by a Doppler shift. So, the receiver must correlate the received signal with C/ A codes with different Doppler
shifts. (Eichelberger, 2019)

   Tracking. After a set of satellites has been acquired, the data contained in the broadcast signal is decoded.
Doppler shifts and C /A code phase are tracked using tracking loops. After the receiver obtains the ephemeris
data and HOW timestamps from at least four satellites, it can start to compute its location. (Eichelberger,
2019)

   Localization. Localization in GPS is achieved using signal time of flight (ToF) measurements. ToFs are the
difference between the arrival times of the HOW timestamps decoded in the tracking stage of the receiver
and those signal transmission timestamps themselves. [14] The local time at the receiver is unknown, and
the localization is done using pseudo ranges. The receiver location is usually found using least-squares
optimization. (Eichelberger, 2019) (Wikipedia, 2021)

   A main disadvantage of GPS is the low bit rate of the navigation data encoded in the signals transmitted
by the satellites. The minimal data necessary to compute a location fix, which includes the ephemerides of the
satellites, repeats only every 30 seconds. [15]

SNAPSHOT RECEIVERS

Snapshot receivers aim at the remaining latency that results from the transmission of timestamps from satellites
396 | SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

every six seconds. Snapshot receivers can determine the ranges to the satellite modulo 1 ms, which corresponds
to 300 km.

COLLECTIVE DETECTION

Collective Detection (CD) is a maximum likelihood snapshot receiver localization method, which does not
determine the arrival time for each satellite but combines all the available information and decides only at
the end of the computation. [16] This technique is critical to the (Eichelberger, 2019) invention to mitigate
spoofing attacks on GPS /GNSS or ADS-B. CD can tolerate a few low-quality satellite signals and is more
robust than CTN. CD requires much computational power. CD can be sped up by a branch and bound
approach, which reduces the computational power per location fix to the order of one second, even for
uncertainties of 100 km and a minute. CD improvements and research has been plentiful. (Eichelberger, 2019)
(J.Liu & et.al., 2012) (Axelrod & al, 2011) (P. Bissag, 2017)

ECD

Dr. Manuel Eichelberger's CD - Collective detection maximum likelihood localization approach method not
only can detect spoofing attacks but also mitigate them! The ECD approach is a robust algorithm to mitigate
spoofing. ECD can differentiate closer differences between the correct and spoofed locations than previously
known approaches. (Eichelberger, 2019) COTS has little spoofing integrated defenses. Military receivers use
symmetrically encrypted GPS signals, subject to a "replay" attack with a small delay to confuse receivers.

   ECD solves even the toughest type of GPS spoofing attack consisting of spoofed signals with power levels
similar to the authentic ones.[17] (Wesson, 2014) For each location fix, the ECD approach uses only a few
milliseconds of raw GPS signals, so-called snapshots. This enables offloading of the computation into the
Cloud, which allows knowledge of observed attacks. [18] Existing spoofing mitigation methods require a
constant stream of GPS signals and tracking those signals over time. Computational load increases because fake
signals must be detected, removed, or bypassed. (Eichelberger, 2019)

SPOOFING TECHNIQUES

According to (Haider & Khalid, 2016), there are three common GPS Spoofing techniques with different
sophistication levels. They are simplistic, intermediate, and sophisticated. (Humphreys & al., 2008)

   The simplistic spoofing attack is the most commonly used technique to spoof GPS receivers. It only requires a
COTS GPS signal simulator, amplifier, and antenna to broadcast signals to the GPS receiver. It was performed
successfully by Los Almos National Laboratory in 2002. (Warner & Johnson, 2002) Simplistic spoofing attacks
                                                                                                   SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS] | 397

can be expensive as the GPS simulator can run $400K and is heavy (not mobile). The available GPS signal and
detection do not synchronize simulator signals is easy.

   In the intermediate spoofing attack, the spoofing component consists of a GPS receiver to receive a genuine
GPS signal and a spoofing device to transmit a fake GPS signal. The idea is to estimate the target receiver
antenna position and velocity and then broadcast a fake signal relative to the genuine GPS signal. This spoofing
attack is difficult to detect and can be partially prevented using an IMU. (Humphreys & al., 2008)

   In sophisticated spoofing attacks, multiple receiver-spoofer devices target the GPS receiver from different
angles and directions. In this scenario, the angle-of-attack defense against GPS spoofing in which the reception
angle is monitored to detect spoofing fails. The only known defense successful against such an attack is
cryptographic authentication. (Humphreys & al., 2008) [19]

   Note that prior research on spoofing was to exclude fake signals and focus on a single satellite. ECD includes the
fake signal on a minimum of four satellites and then progressively / selectively eliminates their effect until the
real weaker GPS signals become apparent. (Eichelberger, 2019)

GPS SIGNAL JAMMING AS A PRECURSOR TO SPOOFING ATTACK

The easiest way to prevent a receiver from finding a GPS location is by jamming the GPS frequency band.
GPS signals are weak and require sophisticated processing to be found. Satellite signal jamming considerably
worsens the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the satellite signal acquisition results. ECD algorithms achieve a
better SNR than classical receivers and tolerate more noise or stronger jamming. (Eichelberger, 2019)

   A jammed receiver is less likely to detect spoofing since the original signals cannot be accurately determined.
The receiver tries to acquire any satellite signals it can find. The attacker only needs to send a set of valid
GPS satellite signals stronger than the noise floor without synchronizing with the authentic signals. [20]
(Eichelberger, 2019)

   There is a more powerful and subtle attack on the jammed signal. To spoof the receiver successfully,
the spoofer can send satellite signals with adjusted power levels synchronized to the authentic signals.
(Eichelberger, 2019) So even if the receiver has countermeasures to differentiate the jamming, the spoofer
signals will be accepted as authentic. (Nichols R. K., 2020)

TWO ROBUST GPS SIGNAL SPOOFING ATTACKS AND ECD

Two of the most powerful GPS signal spoofing attacks are Seamless Satellite-Lock Takeover (SSLT) and
Navigation Data Modification (NDM). How does ECD perform against these?
398 | SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

SEAMLESS SATELLITE-LOCK TAKEOVER (SSLT)

The most powerful attack is a seamless satellite-lock takeover. In such an attack, the original and counterfeit
signals are nearly identical concerning the satellite code, navigation data, code phase, transmission frequency,
and received power. This requires the attacker to know the location of the spoofed device precisely so that ToF
and power losses over a distance can be factored in. After matching the spoofed signals with the authentic ones,
the spoofer can send its signals with a small power advantage to trick the receiver into tracking those instead
of the authentic signals. A classical receiver without spoofing countermeasures, like tracking multiple peaks,
cannot mitigate or detect the SSLT attack, and there is no indication of interruption of the receiver's signal
tracking. (Eichelberger, 2019)

NAVIGATION DATA MODIFICATION (NDM)

An attacker has two attack vectors: modifying the signal's code phase or altering the navigation data--the
former changes the signal arrival time measurements. The latter affects the perceived satellite locations. Both
influence the calculated receiver location. ECD works with snapshot GPS receivers and is not vulnerable to
NDM changes as they fetch information from other sources like the Internet. ECD deals with modified,
wireless GPS signals.

ECD ALGORITHM DESIGN

ECD is aimed at single-antenna receivers. Its spoofing mitigation algorithm object is to identify all likely
localization solutions. It is based on CD because 1) CD has improved noise tolerance compared to classical
receivers, 2) CD is suitable for snapshot receivers, 3) CD is not susceptible to navigation data modifications,
and 4) CD computes a location likelihood distribution which can reveal all likely receiver locations including
the actual location, independent of the number of spoofed and multipath signals. ECD avoids all the spoofing
pitfalls and signal selection problems by joining and transforming all signals into a location likelihood
distribution. Therefore, it defeats the top two GPS spoofing signal attacks. (Eichelberger, 2019)

   Regarding the fourth point, spoofing and multipath signals are similar from a receiver's perspective. Both
result in several observed signals from the same satellite. The difference is that multipath signals have a delay
dependent on the environment while spoofing signals can be crafted to yield a consistent localization solution
at the receiver. To detect spoofing and multipath signals, classical receivers can be modified to track an arbitrary
number of signals per satellite instead of only one. (S.A.Shaukat & al., 2016) In such a receiver, the set
of authentic signals - one signal from each satellite - would have to be correctly identified. Any selection
of signals can be checked for consistency by verifying that the resulting residual error of the localization
algorithm is very small. This is a combinatorically difficult problem. For n satellites and m transmitted sets
                                                                                                   SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS] | 399

of spoofed signals, there are (m+ 1) n possibilities for the receiver to select a set of signals. Only m + 1 of
those will result in a consistent localization solution representing the actual location and m spoofed locations.
ECD avoids this signal selection problem by joining and transforming all signals into a location likelihood
distribution. (Eichelberger, 2019)

   ECD only shows consistent signals since just a few overlapping (synced) signals for some location hypotheses
do not accumulate a significant likelihood. All plausible receiver locations - given the observed signals - have
a high likelihood. Finding these locations in four dimensions, Space and time, is computationally expensive.
(Bissig & Wattenhoffer, 2017) (Eichelberger, 2019) describes improved Branch and Bound implementations
to reduce the calculation load and find plausible receiver locations.[21]

SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE (SIGINT), EW, AND EP
Satellites are perfect for implementing SIGINT and EW, depending on the specific situation and activity. [22]

   This final section will cover the key formulas for successful intercept, the intercept link equation,
communications jamming (by extension spoofing), and communications EP (electronic protection). Radar
Jamming will not be covered but can be found in (Adamy D. L., EW 103: Tactical Battlefield Communications
Electronic Warfare, 2009) and (Adamy D. L., EW 104: EW against a new generation of threats, 2015)

SUCCESSFUL INTERCEPT
Figure 10-13 shows an intercept link.

                                              Figure 10-13 Intercept Link

   Source: Courtesy of and modified from Figure A-1, p200 in (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)
400 | SPACE ELECTRONIC WARFARE [NICHOLS]

   The parameters of this link are the hostile transmitter power, the transmit antenna gain in the direction of the
intercept receiver, the distance to the intercept receiver ( the satellite), and the antenna configuration at the intercept
site. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)

   A successful intercept occurs when a receiver in the satellite receives a hostile signal with enough quality to
recover the information carried by the signal. For communication signals, transmission frequency, modulation,
the type of encryption employed, the signal's timing, or the signal's location can constitute hostile level
quality.[23] Modulation, voice imagery, and data can also constitute hostile quality. [24] (Adamy D. L., Space
Electronic Warfare, 2021)

THE INTERCEPT LINK EQUATION

In order to intercept a signal, the received signal strength must exceed the sensitivity level of the receiver. The
Sensitivity (S) is the weakest signal the receiver can receive and still extract the required information from that
signal. We need to budget for the power out of the receiving antenna. The intercept link equation is (Adamy
D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021):

        PR = ERP - Loss + GR                                             Eq. 10-10

Where:

PR - Power out of the receiving antenna, dBm,

ERP - Effective radiated power of the Hostile signal to be intercepted,

Loss - Loss is the sum of all the losses between the Hostile transmitter's antenna and the intercept

receiver's antenna ( in decibels), (L)

GR - is the receiving antenna gain.

S/L - Signal to Noise Level measure in some minimum, -dB

   Received signal quality is normally stated in a signal-to-noise ratio or minimum level of combined noise
factors to overcome. This is the received signal level at the output of the receiving antenna divided by the noise
level at the same point in the receiver system. The minimum discernable signal (MDS) is the received signal
level when the signal power equals the noise power. (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021)

   Communications Jamming and radar jamming plus EP (electronic protection measures) are covered in
(Adamy D. L., EW 103: Tactical Battlefield Communications Electronic Warfare, 2009) (Adamy D. L., EW
104: EW against a new generation of threats, 2015) (Nichols R. &., 2022). They are beyond the scope of this
chapter.

CONCLUSIONS

For purposes of this chapter and Chapter 10, we have arbitrarily chosen three general altitude reference points:
1) Earth's surface (ground zero); 2) The maximum distance to Geosynchronous and Geostationary Satellites
from the Earth's surface(22,236 mi); and 3) Deep Space beyond the maximum altitude for Satellites (>22,236
mi). (High Earth Orbit, 2023). Satellites are from Earth and present an excellent LOS from many of Earth's
surfaces. Satellites are vulnerable and susceptible to three types of hostile activity: Signal Interception, Signal
Jamming, or interference with uplink or downlink signals and spoofing signals to make the signals function
incorrectly. Our main concentration has been on EW, with a secondary interest in spoofing signals. We have
barely skimmed the topics of Orbital Mechanics (the language of Satellites), signal interception, jamming,
spoofing, and ECD. However, it should give us enough of a flavor of the EW purview to extend our thinking
into Deep Space Warfare (Chapter 12).

ENDNOTES

[1] Professor Adamy has about 50+ years of experience and, as an SME, has written an accelerated set of
EW 101-104 textbooks to define the entire EW playing field. The author was privileged to study under this
accomplished researcher, practitioner, lecturer, and author.

[2] This chapter is a testament to (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) work. It is impossible to
summarize his experience and knowledge, so we have used sections of his technical teachings for our students.

[3] (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) covers all these losses in nauseating detail. From a ChE POV
(ye author), they are just a total system loss regardless of root causes. One number. EEs and RADAR engineers
will find this statement heresy.

[4] Spoofing affects the same path as a jammer.

[5] A precursive jamming operation often accompanies spoofing. (Nichols R. K., 2020)

[6] There are important numbers for space EW calculations: A solar day is 24 hours or 1440 minutes. The
sidereal day is 23.9349 hours or 1436.094 minutes. Kepler's third law is a3 = C x P2, where C= 36,355,285 km3
per min**2. The radius of Earth is 6,371 km. The Earth is proportionally a smooth sphere and can be assumed
as a perfect sphere in orbital calculations. The synchronous satellite period is 23 hours and 56 minutes. The
12-hour satellite is 20,241 km high. The synchronous altitude is 35,873 km. Its range to the horizon is 41,348
km. The width of the Earth from a synchronous satellite is 17.38 degrees. These all make excellent bar bets.

[7] This is truly a complex subject. Chapter 10 has scratched only the surface. Rhode & Schwartz presents a
marvelous Pocket Guide to initiate the student in Radar and EW. It is illustrated and gives all the formulas
on the subject. (Christian Wolff, 2022) Professor Adamy has also issued a popular Electronic Warfare Pocket
Guide that reiterates all the Chapter 10 formulas and explains them better. (Adamy D. L., Electronic Warfare

[8] Aircraft signal transfer is one of many means to localize indoor signals. HAPs, WiFi, Ultrasound, Light,
Bluetooth, RFID Sensor fusion, and GSM are all in the decision-making process.

[9] Experiments based on the TEXBAT database show that a wide variety of attacks can be mitigated. In the
TEXBAT scenarios, an attacker can introduce a maximum error of 222 m and a median error under 19 m.
This is less than a sixth of the maximum unnoticed location offset reported in previous work that only detects
spoofing attacks. (Ranganathan & al., 2016)

[10] According to SPSPATRON.com, GNSS Spoofing in Anti-Drone Systems is the most common
application of GNSS spoofing. The anti-drone system simulates the coordinates of the nearest airport. The
commercial drone is either landing or trying to fly to the takeoff point. There are different usage scenarios
here. Sometimes only GPS is spoofed, and the other constellations are blocked. Sometimes GLONASS + GPS
are spoofed. There are also different scenarios in terms of the duration of use. Automatic systems generate a
fake signal within minutes. Sometimes a spoofer is activated for many hours. (GPSPATRON, 2022) ECD can
handle this and other forms of signal spoofing.

[11] The author has nicknamed Dr. Manuel Eichelberger's brilliant doctoral research ECD. ECD is Dr.
Manuel Eichelberger's advanced implementation of CD to detect and mitigate spoofing attacks on GPS or
ADS-B signals

[12] This is a key point. CD reduces this timestamping process significantly.

[13] Data is sent on a carrier frequency of 1575.42 MHz (IS-GPS-200G, 2013)

[14] GPS satellites operate on atomic frequency standards; the receivers are not synchronized to GPS time.

[15] Because the receiver must decode all that data, it has to continuously track and process the satellite signals,
which translates to high energy consumption. Furthermore, the TTFF on startup costs the user both latency
and power.

[16] The vector/tensor mathematics for localization are reasonably complex and can be found in Chapter 5.3
of (Eichelberger, 2019)

[17] (Eichelberger, 2019) ECD achieves median errors under 19 m on the TEXBAT dataset, which is the de
facto reference dataset for testing GPS anti-spoofing algorithms. (Ranganathan & al., 2016)

[18] Cloud offloading also makes ECD suitable for energy-constrained sensors.

SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND
SIMULATION [DIEBOLD]

PURVIEW

Various industries, from business to engineering to the military, use the concepts of modeling and simulations
for multiple applications. Regardless of the use case, modeling and simulation strive to predict the results of an
actual event, accounting for all the potential variables and performance parameters, to improve the likelihood
of success during execution.

   This chapter seeks to 1. describe the history and value of modeling and simulation in the context of modern
aerospace and national defense challenges, 2. provide current techniques and toolsets that apply modeling and
simulations, 3. and describe the use cases for leveraging these techniques.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

  · Students will understand the criticality of aerospace systems modeling and simulations in the context of
      modern threats and multi-domain operations.

  · Students will have a working knowledge of the inputs that contribute to building a space model and
      methods for simulating space threats.

  · Students will understand the use cases for modeling and simulation for commercial and defense
      purposes.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

  · Modeling and simulation of a space shuttle's flight or a satellite's orbit are inherently different from
      aviation because, in most cases, a spacecraft cannot be recalled and must be validated across the totality
      of its operational mission before the first launch attempt.

  · The use of space for civil, commercial, and military purposes has expanded exponentially since the
      1960s, with over 4,000 operational satellites and estimated hundreds more pieces of debris in orbit today
                                                                            SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD] | 407

      flying at thousands of km/h. The advent of intercontinental, hypersonic, and anti-satellite weapons
      further complicated operations in space, which the US now interprets as a warfighting domain.
  · Models and simulations can be categorized by their application (area/environment), resolution level
      (scale), role (function), and technique. In addition, various computer-based tools are widely available for
      civil, commercial, and military uses, which augment or replace the legacy tabletop wargaming
      techniques used to inform decisions about space operations.

INTRODUCTION

Before the advent of computers and automation, military theorists aptly described the enduring characteristics
of war and what made great leaders successful in predicting the outcomes of battles. In The Art of War, written
approximately 2,500 years ago, Sun Tzu articulated a component of strategy as knowing the enemy and oneself.
If you can clearly understand both, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles (Tzu). In the 1800s, Carl
von Clausewitz wrote On War, describing probability as one component of the paradoxical trinity. Probability
amounts to the fog and friction inherent in combat, comparable to the operational and mission variables[1],
as well as chance, accounting for the factors of any given situation that one cannot predict (Clausewitz). In the
same period, Baron de Jomini wrote The Art of War, taking a scientific approach by applying critical tenants
to the planning and execution of war that would guarantee a commander's success (Jomini). The latter two
theorists built their concepts after observing Napoleon, whom many considered a "military genius" during
the rise of nation-states and the French Revolution. Unlike modern military, civilian, and business leaders,
Napoleon relied on intellect and aptitude to make decisions, observed as having the gift of coup d'oeil.[2] In
other words, he had the ability to see all factors and variables of a battle wholistically in a way that allowed him
to make rapid and accurate decisions with near clairvoyance (Clausewitz).

   Although each theorist described the timeless principles of war and what made leaders like Napoleon
successful, none lived in a period where the prospect of space warfare, computers, or automation was possible.
However, their observations collectively highlight the same problems modern modeling and simulations
address, which historical military leaders solved with theory, strategy, and intuition. Given a set of resources,
an operating space, and unpredictable variables, how can we reliably estimate the outcome of any given space
operation?

   The modern age of computing and automation made simulations famous when predictions became more
than just thoughts in the minds of expert planners, using vast data sets and calculations to rapidly and
objectively compute an outcome that humans would never be able to complete. WarGames, the 1983 classic
movie where David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) discovers North American Aerospace Defense
Command's (NORAD) War Operation Plan Response (WOPR) supercomputer simulator, fantasizes about
the impact of modeling thermonuclear and biotoxic chemical war. WOPR simulated a Soviet Union first-
strike nuclear attack against the United States, autonomously triggering a response by US nuclear sites that
408 | SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD]

nearly started World War III. WOPR performed hundreds of simulations with different variables and found
no scenario where a ballistic missile-enabled atomic war could be won (Badham, 1983). The fantasy dreamed
by Hollywood 40 years ago is now a reality of the 21st century, with the WOPR demonstrating an actual use
case of modeling and simulations used by the US military. Today, dozens of modeling software programs and
fully customized simulators for aerospace purposes are widely accessible and, in some cases, made secretly for
national defense. Although supercomputers are necessary for some simulations, depending on the precision
and accuracy required, devices as small as a smartphone or a tablet computer now have the computational
power to get results for various use cases. Before attempting to understand the "what" and "how," it is essential
to know why space modeling and simulations are critical in modern aerospace challenges.

SPACE LAUNCH HISTORY AND CONTEXT

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) opened on October 1, 1958, with aspirations
to achieve President Kennedy's objective of completing the first human trip to the moon in the 1960s. NASA
accomplished this goal with the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969 and subsequently expanded the mission with
five more successful moon landings through 1972 (NASA, 2018). However, none of NASA's early successes in
the Mercury (1958-1963), Gemini (1962-1966), and Apollo (1961-1972) programs could have been possible
without extensive modeling and simulations of the first spaceflights before they launched. In 1973, Carroll
H. "Pete" Woodling, Chief of NASA's Crew Training and Simulation Division from 1972-1974 (NASA,
2000), published an experience report of the simulations of manned space flight for crew training. He defined
a simulator as a "complex set of hardware (including computers, visual display systems, and simulated crew
stations) that presents, with a high degree of accuracy, the total flight characteristics of the actual spacecraft and
mission." In the years leading up to Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo program launches, flight crews spent one-
third or more of their total training time in simulations, such as the Command Module Simulator depicted
in Figure 11-1. During this period, mission simulators dominated much of the total simulation time, growing
from 53% to 67% to 80% across the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. The 59 crew members in these
programs spent 38,261 hours (~4.37 years) conducting simulations before their space missions between 1958
and 1972 (See Figure 11-2) (Woodling, et al., 1973).

                           Figure 11-1: Apollo Program Command Module Simulator

   The success or failure of space missions and the crew's safety relies more on modeling and simulation than
any type of aviation operation. The nature of space flight, both in the 1960s and today, is unique in that the
vehicle is fully committed at lift-off or launch to the entire mission, experiencing a broad range of mission
variables during extended operational timelines. There is no immediate ability to recall vehicles launched into
space, like cruise, ballistic, hypersonic missiles, torpedoes, and many unmanned vehicle operations in denied
                                                                             SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD] | 411

areas (FCNL Education Fund, 2021). Space flight is starkly different from manned aviation where aircraft and
crew members are trained and evaluated through live environment flights to validate proficiency and capability
gradually. Space vehicles and their crew members must be prepared, proficient, and validated on the entirety
of the mission, accounting for all potential flight variables and contingencies before the first launch attempt.
After analyzing all of NASA's earliest space endeavors, Woodling noted the use of comprehensive, high-fidelity
simulators as a firm requirement in future space programs (Woodling, et al., 1973).

   The wide use of modeling and simulation is essential moving into the 21st century as space flight becomes
increasingly commonplace. Although sources differ on the number of successful space missions, there were
more space launches in 2022 than in any other year. The Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS) reported 182, a 29% increase over 2021 (See Figure 11-3) (CSIS, 2023). Space-based capabilities are also
becoming increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life as the cost of commercial space use decreases, and private
companies take the lead. Following the retirement of the US space shuttle program, the US government had
to rely on other national and commercial launch providers to move goods and astronauts to the international
space station. New micro and nanosat technology facilitated the development of small satellites at low cost,
which drove the increase in commercially licensed space launches by 100% between 2016 and 2018, primarily
in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) category. As of 2020, approximately 2,000 active satellites were orbiting Earth
with 1,300 in LEO, 75 in Medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) (primarily for global navigation services), and 430
in Geosynchronous-Earth Orbit (GEO) (most often used for telecommunications and weather) with 2021
breaking a trend by adding over 1,400 satellites in a single year (International Trade Administration, n.d.)
(Chakrabarti, 2021) (NASA, 2009). Some sources place the total number of satellites in orbit today at well over
4,000, with 75 countries owning at least one satellite, over 60% of the total attributed to the US, and SpaceX
being the largest private company owner responsible for over 43% of active satellites (See Figure 11-4) (ESRI,
2022). In addition to the commercial satellite space, SpaceX's Inspiration4 made history on September 15,
2021, as the first all-civilian space mission to launch into Earth's orbit, following two successful sub-orbital
space flights by Virgin Galactic's Unity 22 and Blue Origin's New Shepard (Howell, 2021). Although science
and technology have improved the capability to launch satellites dramatically since Sputnik (the first satellite
launched into Earth's orbit on October 4, 1957), the number of players, time constraints, weather, and space
obstacle variables have increased concurrently, placing a more significant burden on advanced modeling and
simulations to achieve successful space flights. However, civilian space vehicles and satellites are not the only
use case for aerospace simulators today. Advanced missile systems and unmanned vehicles developed since
the 1940s now require the same precision and accuracy as a rocket flying into space. This represents another
modeling and simulation use case applied across the multi-domain operations spectrum.

EVOLVING THREAT CONTEXT

The tools of war have evolved with revolutions in military affairs, providing a temporary asymmetric advantage
to the user who had it first. Regarding the use cases for modeling and simulation, none is more significant
than the advent of the cruise missile, a low-flying, guided rocket weapon with a low radar cross-section. The
German V-1, developed in the early 1940s, is widely understood to be the first cruise missile, and was initially
used against London from 1942-1944 (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica, 2023). As a precursor to the
weapons later developed by the US, Soviet Union, China, and others, the V-1 had a length of 27 ft, carried
an 850 kg warhead, flew at 640 km/h, and had an operational range of 250 km (P., 2014). It had limited
aerodynamic controls and poor accuracy, with only about 25% reaching its intended targets (University of
Florida Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering). Although its characteristics are similar, the
lacking range, in-flight controls, and accuracy of the German V-1 are almost incomparable to the most capable
cruise and ballistic missiles employed today by the US.

   The US's most prominent operational cruise missile is the Tomahawk (See Figure 11-5), which comes in
dozens of variants and can carry both conventional and nuclear payloads. The Tomahawk has been in service
since 1983, can carry a 454 kg payload, and range as far as 2,500 km at subsonic speeds or up to 800 km/h
depending on the mission and weapon variant.[3] Unlike the V-1, the Tomahawk incorporates a mix of Terrain
Contour Matching (TERCOM), Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DMAC), and Global Positioning
Satellite (GPS) guidance to achieve precision and accuracy, validated through service in the 1991 Gulf War and
2003 Iraq invasion among other conflicts. One of the most public, widely known examples of a mass cruise
missile strike was on April 6, 2017, when the US fired 59 Tomahawks against Shayrat Air Base to destroy
Syrian forces that conducted a chemical attack against the city of Khan Sheikhoun (See Figures 11-6, 11-7, and
11-8) (CSIS Missile Defense Project, 2023). To execute this attack, each missile had to be individually planned
from launch to impact and synchronized in time and space to ensure the mission's success and limit collateral
damage (Eckstein, 2017). This type of operation is only possible with modern modeling of the weapon's
characteristics and a thorough simulation of the missile's flight against numerous variables, including weather
and threat missile defenses. For responsible nation-states seeking to limit collateral damage, the planning,
accuracy, and precision requirements for each missile launch only increase as the weapon becomes more deadly.

   The LGM-30G Minuteman III, which started service in 1970, is a solid-fueled Intercontinental Ballistic
Missile (ICBM) and the only remaining land-based component of the US nuclear triad. By the numbers,
it has a length of 18.2m, carries either a 335kT (W78) or 300kT (W87) nuclear warhead, and has a range
of 13,000km. Although details on the US nuclear triad are limited, available documentation suggests the
Minuteman III has a fast launch time (consistent with solid fuel propellant), 100% reliability in testing,
and backup launch controllers that make the system more resilient (CSIS Missile Defense Project, 2021).
Moreover, the Minuteman III travels on a suborbital trajectory outside Earth's atmosphere, like the early
ICBMs modified for use as launch vehicles for manned orbital missions (Refer to Figure 11-9) (Tate, 2021).
Unlike cruise missiles, nuclear weapons have only been used offensively twice in history, during the bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, by the US on August 6th and 9th, 1944 (History.com Editors, 2022). The
"Little Boy" and "Fat Man" bombs were delivered by B-29 aircraft and instantly killed 80,000 and 40,000
people between Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" were deployed over their
targets without modern weapons' precision guidance and accuracy (History.com Editors, 2009).
418 | SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD]

   Imagine a scenario where a Minuteman III is launched from North Dakota, intending to strike Hiroshima
over 9,500 km away. In one simulation with the W78 payload, the Minuteman III could cause over 329,000
fatalities and 457,000 injuries at Hiroshima in a single airburst strike, quadrupling the immediate casualty
count observed in World War II (Wellerstein, 2022). The impact of a failure or deviation at any point from
missile launch to detonation could be catastrophic. Like a spacecraft, there is no ability to recall an ICBM-
delivered nuclear weapon and, indeed, no ability to evaluate the exact mission profile before launch. The
situation, performance characteristics of the flight, and impact all justify the heavy application of modeling
and simulation before ever attempting an ICBM launch to increase the chances of a successful flight and
the accuracy of the missile itself. Space-based modeling, concerning ICBMs, is even more important as the
prospect of a launch vehicle in orbit capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to any point on Earth becomes a
reality.

   Hypersonic weapons further complicate the modeling and simulation process in both the offensive use
of the missile and defense against missile attacks from peer adversaries. Although hypersonic weapons have
existed for over 50 years, China, Russia, and the US have made recent progress in the capability to deploy
these missiles for reliable, sustained flight (Watts, Trotti, & Massa, 2020). There are two basic categories of
hypersonic weapons. Like ICBMs, Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGV) can launch into space using a rocket and
orbit the Earth under their momentum or travel at suborbital speeds before re-entry and maneuvering through
the atmosphere. HGVs are sometimes called hypersonic boost-glide weapons when combined with their rocket
booster. The second category is the Hypersonic Cruise Missile (HCM), which is powered by a high-speed,
air-breathing engine after acquiring its target (Congressional Research Service, 2023). HCMs are like other
cruise missiles in their ability to maneuver throughout flight rather than following a specific trajectory, but
differ from other missile types in their speed, traveling between Mach 5 and 25 for an entire flight if required.
Refer to Figures 11-10 and 11-11 for a graphic comparison of hypersonic, cruise, and ballistic missiles. Modern
hypersonic weapons can capture the best characteristics of both ICBMs and cruise missiles by adding speed
and the ability to maneuver for an entire flight, forming a hybrid of existing model classifications (Brockmann
& Schiller, 2022). The US Army, with cross-service participation, plans to integrate these new classifications
of hypersonic missiles into the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) in 2023, forming a battery within the
Strategic Fires Battalion (Congressional Research Service, 2023). See Figure 11-12 for a depiction of a generic
MDTF structure. In concept, these weapons will be commanded through the Army's Advanced Field Artillery
Tactical Data System (AFATDS) and require unique Transporter-Erector-Launchers (TEL) (Freedberg, 2019).
See Figure 11-13 for a picture of the prototype hypersonic weapon delivered to 17th Field Artillery Brigade.
Among the multiple reported hypersonic projects on the horizon, the U.S. Air Force has also evaluated the air-
launched AGM-183A (See Figure 11-14) with the B-52H since April 2021 (Tingley, 2022). Concurrent with
US developments, China and Russia have also built and evaluated capable hypersonic weapons. In mid-2021,
China experimented with two hypersonic gliders launched into LEO, traveling partially around the Earth
before being released to engage test targets (See Figure 11-15 for a model of the Chinese DF-ZF). These tests
differed from the short, suborbital, ballistic flight with which an HGV is typically deployed, demonstrating an
intercontinental travel capability (The International Institute for Strategic Studies, 2022). Additionally, Russia
has used the Kinzhal hypersonic missile (See Figure 11-16), an air-launched variant deployable by MiG-31
and Su-34 fighters unveiled in 2018, in combat against Ukraine as recently as March 2023 in conjunction
with a conventional missile attack (Neuman, 2023). Requirements for planning a hypersonic missile strike in
the modeling and simulations space also translate to defending against them, complicating existing homeland
defense planning for Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Ground-Based Mid-Course Defense (GMD),
and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems (GAO, 2022). See Figures 11-17 and 11-18

   Anti-Satellite Weapons (ASAT) present another complex problem for modeling and simulations as their
targets orbit at approximately 28,000 km/h in LEO relative to an observer on Earth (National Air and
Space Museum, 2017). Although a satellite in LEO travels at the upper end of the high hypersonic regime
(Mach 23), orbits are predictable, unlike the flight trajectories of HGVs and HCMs. ASATs come in various
weapon platforms, ranging from missiles meant to destroy satellites to lasers and jammers that disrupt them
physically. The US built the first ASAT, an air-launched ballistic missile named Blue Orion, in response to
the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in 1957 (Blatt, 2020). Over the next 30 years, Cold War competition
brought the Soviet co-orbital ASATs that attempted to synchronize their orbits with target satellites before
detonating, as well as the US ASM-135, which used a hit-to-kill method exploiting kinetic force alone. The
                                                                            SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD] | 429

Reagan administration first evaluated the ASM-135 in 1985, demonstrating its capability to destroy an actual
satellite in orbit (Blatt, 2020). Since the first successful ASAT tests, China, India, and Russia have researched
and expanded their capabilities. Each have recently demonstrated that these weapons remain a threat in the
space domain. On January 11th, 2007, China destroyed one of its weather satellites with a modified ballistic
missile that created over 3,000 trackable pieces of debris, the largest ever debris field generated by an ASAT
(Hadley, 2023). India performed a more carefully planned test on March 27th, 2019, using the Prithvi Delivery
Vehicle Mark-II (PDV MK-II) to destroy their own Microsat-R satellite (launched on January 24th, 2019,
specifically for this test) in a sun-synchronous orbit at approximately 282 km above the Earth. India's test
only produced about 400 fragments of space debris, most of which would decay naturally in the weeks and
months following the test (Tellis, 2019). On November 15th, 2021, Russia used the Nudol PL-19 (See Figure
11-20) anti-ballistic missile interceptor as an ASAT to destroy its own Cosmos 1408 satellite approximately
500 km above the Earth, creating about 1,500 pieces of trackable debris in orbit. The debris from both
the Chinese and Russian events still poses a direct threat to astronauts on the International Space Station,
who must routinely maneuver their vehicle in orbit to avoid debris and will for many years to come. In the
wake of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia has publicly noted the threat of Western satellites aiding
Ukraine, such as the Starlink constellation, and has threatened action against US assets in space (Bugos, 2021).
Unlike other types of weapon tests conducted on Earth or inside the atmosphere, debris created in space from
ASATs is technically challenging to remove and, currently, only occurs through natural degradation. Technical
demonstrations such as Japan's End-of-Life Services by Astroscale Demonstration (ELSA-d) and the ongoing
Swiss ClearSpace debris-removing spacecraft planned for launch in 2025 are working towards orbital debris
removal capabilities, but are only nascent compared to the scale of the problem (David, 2021) (Skibba, 2021)
(Kim, 2021). Although ASATs are not the only cause of space debris, they deliberately induce havoc and could
pose an enduring problem through a theoretical phenomenon known as the Kessler Syndrome. In this theory,
cascading debris perpetually creates more space junk through subsequent collisions to form debris belts that
make orbits unusable (Smith, 2022). The use of ASATs and the corresponding requirement to simulate their
effects across all objects orbiting in space is a more complex problem, requiring more advanced models and
simulations than any previous contextual example in this chapter. As of this chapter's writing, China, India,
Russia, and the US are the only nations that have conducted an ASAT test. The US is the only of those four
who self-imposed a moratorium on testing future direct-ascent ASAT missile systems (Panda & Silverstein,
2022) (Arms Control Association, 2022).

   Holistically, China and Russia have expanded their total missile, air defense, and space arsenals to
incorporate evolving technology described earlier in this chapter as a component of their anti-access area denial
networks. China and Russia combine ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missile technology with survivable and
mobile delivery mechanisms that can launch them from the air, land, and sea. The combination of their total
missile forces dispersed in orders of battle presents a complex problem for any future war with the ability to
threaten any safe haven on Earth (CSIS Missile Defense Project, 2021) (Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance,
2023). See Figures 11-21 and 11-22 for Chinese missile capabilities and Figure 11-23 for Russian land-based
missile capabilities.

MODELING AND SIMULATION IN DOCTRINE
Strategy and wargames have existed for thousands of years, with the Chinese board game "go" dating back as
early as 2356 BCE (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica, n.d.). However, recent history suggests that the
earliest adaptations of modern wargaming techniques originated from the Prussians, who were, at the time,
trying to overcome Napoleon's advantages. In 1811, Herr von Reisswitz, Prussian War Counselor, invented a
wargame that included a terrain table, computations for attrition, technical factors such as range and terrain,
and even the issue of chance, which had not previously been used. General Helmuth von Moltke continued
the practice while in competition with France once he became Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army (Caffrey,
2000). Wargaming captured what a model-based simulation could not at the time, but that would soon change
with additional technology and complexity on the 20th and 21st-century battlefields.

   The US Army adopted its current decision methodology, aptly named the Military Decision-Making
Process (MDMP), in 1997 with the publication of Field Manual (FM) 101-5, Staff Organization and
Operations. MDMP created a single decision-making model from the previous deliberate, combat, and quick
434 | SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD]

models used in the outdated Tactical Decision-Making Process (TDMP). The basic steps in MDMP include
1. Receipt of Mission, 2. Mission Analysis, 3. Course of Action Development, 4. Course of Action Analysis
(Wargaming), 5. Course of Action Comparison, 6. Course of Action Approval, and 7. Orders Production
(Wampler, Centric, & Salter, 1998). MDMP remains the procedural decision-making tool for tactical-level US
Army staff and requires at least a basic application of wargaming to validate that any given course of action
meets the criteria of being feasible, acceptable, and suitable. In other words, wargaming validates that the
actions a given organization is about to take will achieve the end state intended in an order. Since the 1800s,
models, simulations, and wargames have also changed with new operational concepts, especially complicated
by adding joint concepts and multiple domains.

   US joint warfighting concepts that acknowledged a need for interoperability between multiple domains date
back to the War of 1812, when naval operations on Lake Champlain proved decisive in the Army's land-based
campaigns. However, it took 100 years and the aftermath of the Spanish American War for the US military to
establish a joint board composed of military leaders in multiple services, including the Army and Navy. Finally,
at the end of World War II, the National Security Act of 1947 formally established the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
which set conditions for many of the joint concepts and doctrine used today for warfighting (Joint Chiefs of
Staff, n.d.).

   Over the past 50 years, the US Army underwent five major overhauls in operational concepts, each adapting
to the most significant national security challenges of its time. The US Army introduced Active Defense in
1976 on the heels of the Vietnam War as the US shifted its focus to Europe and the threat posed by the
Soviet Union. Active Defense echoed more traditional concepts of attrition and terrain-focused warfare forms,
remaining separate from the air and maritime operational concepts. As commander of Training and Doctrine
Command, General Donn Starry noted the shortcomings in Active Defense that could not address Soviet
second-echelon forces and emphasized the need for early interdiction. To tackle the problems with a flexible
response to the Soviet Union's extreme numerical advantage in combat power, the US Army adopted AirLand
Battle in 1982. AirLand Battle acknowledged the three-dimensional nature of war, with the land and air
warfighting domains as inseparable, capturing the impact of technological advances in modern battles and the
fast tempo associated with future wars (Skinner, 1988).

   After Desert Storm, the US Army implemented Full Spectrum Operations (FSO) in 2001 and Unified
Land Operations (ULO) in 2011 (Granai, 2015) (See Figure 11-24 for a graphic depiction of the ULO
operational framework). Both operational concepts incorporated offense, defense, and stability, but they
viewed warfighting domains differently than AirLand Battle. Although Space Command was first introduced
in 1985, FSO was the first Army operational concept to characterize battlespaces in the air, land, sea, and space
domains (Headquarters Department of the Army, 2001) (Lopez, 2019). ULO also acknowledged the need for
Army forces to execute operations across multiple domains, including space, but also added cyberspace as a
domain (Headquarters Department of the Army, 2011).

   Before discussing Multi-Domain Operations, it is important to note three significant structural and policy
changes that directly impact the US interpretation of actions in the space domain and how combat power
can be applied. In 2018, President Trump published a National Space Strategy that recognized space as a
warfighting domain (Fact Sheets: President Donald J. Trump is Unveiling an America First National Space
Strategy, 2018). Many previous administrations acknowledged the need to protect US national security in and
from the space domain, but never had a national strategy acknowledged space as a warfighting domain. In
2019, US Space Command was formally re-established, this time as a functional unified combatant command
(Lopez, 2019) (Title 10 USC Ch 6: Combatant Commands, n.d.). Finally, the US Space Force was established
in 2019 as a service in the US military to organize, train, and equip Guardians (US Space Force, n.d.). Each
436 | SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD]

of these central policy and organizational changes acknowledges the growing criticality of operations in outer
space and the threats posed by near-peer competitors such as China and Russia noted earlier in this chapter.

   The US Army's newest operational concept was implemented in 2022 and is now called Multi-Domain
Operations (MDO). MDO acknowledges the existence of land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace and
emphasizes Army operations spanning the physical, information, and human dimensions in each of the five
domains (See Figure 11-25). MDO also expanded the deep area into the extended deep area, including the
operational and strategic deep fires areas depicted in Figures 11-26 and 11-27 (Headquarters Department of
the Army, 2022). In practice, MDO elevated the US Army's primary unit of action from the Brigade to the
Division level (See Figures 11-28 and 11-29 for the MDO operational framework and roles of each echelon)
and now accounts for the need to provide effects convergence across the spectrum in support of unified action
with the joint force. Figures 11-30 to 11-33 graphically depict the concept of effects convergence within the
MDO operational framework while Figures 11-34 and 11-35 showcase notional offense and defense scenarios.

   Thinking back to MDMP as a decision-making framework, the MDO operational concept now requires
Army staff officers to model a variety of threats in all five domains, simulate large-scale combat, and compare
the results of multiple courses of action. As a result, the space domain cannot remain solely an operational and
strategic concern for military planners. With the publication of the US Army's MDO concept, space modeling
and simulations is now a tactical-level responsibility in the wargaming process, requiring a modern solution
of toolsets widely proliferated among planners. While sufficient for simulating interactions between ground,
air, and maritime order of battle units, the adaptive tabletop wargaming methods may no longer be capable of
capturing the complexities of actions in space and cyberspace.

MODELING AND SIMULATION FRAMEWORK

Previously in this chapter, we identified a definition for simulation specific to the Apollo space program use
case. Taking a more holistic look at models and simulations across various aerospace use cases, it is helpful to
characterize these terms more generally. In a Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, James Coolahan defined
a model as "a physical, mathematical, or otherwise logical representation of a system, entity, phenomenon,
or process" and simulation as "a method for implementing a model over time" (Coolahan, 2003). Models
in a space context may account for a single shuttle, a hypersonic missile, or the totality of satellites orbiting
Earth with free-floating debris. Similarly, simulations must account for several situations, from a shuttle launch
to large-scale combat operations, showing the progression of hundreds of missiles, electronic warfare effects,
aircraft, satellites, etc.

   There are multiple ways of categorizing models and simulations, but Coolahan's four viewpoints fit the
space use cases described in this chapter. In many cases, models and simulations will have one or more of the
following categories and components.

 1. Application Domain - Captures a specific problem area within a model or simulation, including space
      physics, a battlefield's geographic area (potentially in the maritime, air, land, space, and cyber domains),
      or a transportation network.

 2. Resolution Level - Identifies the amount of detail and the extent of aggregation within a given model or
      simulation. As an example, a satellite may have propulsion, actions of maneuvering surfaces, and power
      generation aggregated together in a single model at a particular level of resolution (See Figure 11-36 for
      further examples of military and physiological resolution levels).

 3. Role - The function a specific model or simulation is built to accomplish. An example could be to
      evaluate a hypersonic missile's flight performance, analyze a joint firepower strike against multiple
      satellites, or train a space crew on their duties in the spacecraft.

 4. Technique - The method a given model or simulation uses to accomplish its purpose. Examples include
      a static display of a lunar vehicle, a dynamic, constructed environment simulating a space launch, or a
      model of hardware system components interacting.

Figure 11-37 provides a graphic depiction of Coolahan's four viewpoints and additional sample characteristics.
   Given the threat context and mass proliferation of space-based capabilities described earlier in this chapter,

models and simulations must not be constrained to highly technical users. To be successful, models and
simulations must be widely used and accepted within the community of interest they support, have a
framework that is effective when applied in practice, be available across a large user base, be affordable to the
organizations that need it, and be accessible for users to adopt (West & Birkmire, 2020). Models both improve
the chances of success for a mission during execution and reduce the overall costs of capability development.

MODELING AND SIMULATION TOOLS
The following list of tools is just a tiny sample of the instruments available for modeling and simulating
space effects. Casual gamers may note that there are dozens of realistic space flight simulators on the Steam
marketplace as of the publication of this document, many of which are not captured here. DoD employees may
also recognize that well-known tools are not included in this list, primarily due to classification and usefulness
to an academic audience. There are also customized space simulators, like those developed by NASA for the
space shuttle program and SpaceX for commercial purposes, which are proprietary and not publicly available.
Nonetheless, this list demonstrates the potential for computer-based modeling today and dozens of use cases
for both military and civil purposes.

IMPROVED MANY ON MANY (IMOM)

IMOM is a commonly used modeling and simulation tool developed by the Air Force Electronic Warfare
Center (AFEWC). This software's specific purpose is to simulate the routing of an attack aircraft as it
penetrates enemy air defense systems, including radars and surface-to-air weapons, providing planners insight
into the vulnerability of detection, tracking, and engagement of friendly aircraft along a specific route. Self-
protection and stand-off jamming are also critical components of the IMOM simulation. IMOM is
customizable to meet user needs and can ingest various classified and unclassified data sets (Ormesher, 1993).
Although there are few use cases where IMOM could be used to model activities in the space domain, it
provides an example of critical data points to consider in the simulation process for military planners seeking
to model aerial flight against a complex enemy air defense (Diebold, 2023).

   A combat simulation in IMOM requires a scenario containing an Electronic Order-of-Battle (EOB), terrain
mapping, radar, threat, and jammer databases (Ormesher, 1993). The EOB file should provide IMOM with
the names and locations of threat radars, weapons, and jammers on Earth's surface, which can then be modified
individually or linked to databases of standardized military equipment (Ormesher, 1993). A sample EOB is
depicted in Figure 11-38, further identifying radars with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
name, Electronic Intelligence Notation (ELNOT), Personal Identification Number (PIN), and type of radar
(further described in the radar database portion of this chapter).

                                          Figure 11-38: Sample EOB Listing

   The terrain file ingested into IMOM typically only captures elevation, but the resolution level in the file is
essential to consider (Ormesher, 1993). For example, there are three standardized levels of post spacing when
using Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED). DTED level 0 has a post spacing of 30 arc seconds (~1km
between cells), where DTED level 1 has a post spacing of three arc seconds (~100m), and DTED level 2
is at one arc second (~30m) (VTP, n.d.). The higher the DTED level, the more accurate the line-of-sight
analysis. However, there is a tradeoff in simulation time, which takes much longer to complete when using
more detailed terrain data (higher levels of DTED) given the additional computation required (Diebold, 2023).
Figures 11-39 to 11-41 graphically depict how IMOM calculates line of sight from a radar to an aircraft and
how terrain data factors into the output (whether a particular radar can see an aircraft).

   The radar database file lists parameters to model each specific enemy radar, including power levels, beam
widths, antenna gains, and receiver losses. Radars are also characterized by type, with Early Warning (EW) or
Target Acquisition (TA) assumed to have vertical beams scanning horizontally and Fire Control (FC), Target
Tracking (TT), and Height Finding (HF) assumed to be non-scanning beams pointed at an aircraft (Ormesher,
1993). Figures 11-42 to 11-43 show how IMOM calculates a radar's beam look angle and range while Figure
11-44 shows how IMOM determines the slant distance from the radar to an aircraft.

   The threat database file lists parameters linked or unlinked to the performance characteristics of weapon
systems associated with radar systems (Ormesher, 1993). The primary attributes of a surface-to-air weapon
system are the maximum and minimum engagement altitude and the maximum, minimum, and
recommended intercept ranges. Although IMOM does not always incorporate seeker types, munition speeds,
and their probability of success against specific airframes based on exposure time, this can be considered for
windows of vulnerability after a holistic IMOM analysis (Diebold, 2023).

   The jammer file simply contains the specific parameters for modeling standardized jammers and their
configurations (Ormesher, 1993). Figure 11-45 graphically shows how IMOM models the geometry of a
jammer with respect to a radar and aircraft in the simulation. When performing calculations to determine
a jammer's effectiveness, IMOM considers the overlapping frequencies between radar signals and jammer
transmitters in addition to geometry.

   Beyond the threats and operational environment models, IMOM also models the friendly aircraft and the
route it will attempt to fly. When modeling the aircraft, the most important input is the Radar Cross Section
(RCS), often measured in decibels (dB) (Diebold, 2023). MIT defines an RCS as the area intercepting that
amount of power which, if radiated isotropically, produces the same received power in the radar (See Figure
11-46 for a graphic depiction of RCS). Many factors, including the aircraft's size, shape, orientation, and
materials contribute to its RCS (See Figure 11-47), but the three main contributors are structural, propulsion,
and avionics (See Figure 11-48) (MIT Lincoln Laboratory, 2018). IMOM can simplify RCS by applying a
constant value (usually the highest value across all aircraft or missile orientations), or it can create a 3D pattern
for calculations that will account for the look angle of each radar and the aircraft's orientation for detection
(Ormesher, 1993). The most critical inputs along the aircraft's route are speed and altitude, which when
calculated with position, also allows for orientation to the radar to be factored in (See Figure 11-49 and 11-51).
These inputs contribute to how individual radar and weapon systems interpret a friendly aircraft or missile and
could impact a threat's ability to see it all together, even if all other variables in IMOM's calculations suggest
458 | SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD]

it should be able to. Without external contributing factors (such as a jammer or weather), RCS is the primary
variable that friendly forces can influence in a detection decision (See Figure 11-50) (Diebold, 2023).

   IMOM's output is both a graphic display and summary file that indicates the effectiveness of radar (Figure
11-52 depicts the baseline algorithm for determining a radar's range with respect to aircraft RCS) against an
aircraft along its route. The simplest and the most important check that IMOM performs is a comparison of
the aircraft, radar, and terrain position and height along a route. This is most comparable to a line-of-sight
analysis, which can show if an aircraft is terrain masked effectively while in range of a radar or weapon system.
When an aircraft is detected at a specific time and place along the route, IMOM checks the jammer profile to
determine whether radar effects should be negated. The user can then compare an aircraft's position when the
vulnerability was identified to the potential weapon systems that could perform an engagement (Ormesher,
1993). Figure 11-54 describes the IMOM ROUTE algorithm in detail, showing how all previously mentioned
data sets are incorporated into determining an aircraft's level of detection (See Figure 11-55) along each point
in its flight path.

   As mentioned at the beginning of this section, IMOM was not designed for modeling space domain
entities. However, the same inputs required to model an aircraft or missile flying in the atmosphere could be
extrapolated for other space-centric use cases, such as space electronic warfare or unmanned aircraft satellite
communication link analysis (Diebold, 2023) (Drew, 2023).
ADVANCED FRAMEWORK FOR SIMULATION, INTEGRATION, AND MODELING (AFSIM)
AFSIM was created by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to make modeling and simulation
ubiquitous in the weapon system concept development process, providing a framework for military
simulations that seek to analyze, experiment, and wargame. Although developed by the Air Force, AFSIM is a
multi-domain toolset capable of modeling land, air, sea, and space-based platforms such as tanks, helicopters,
submarines, and satellites. The software also enables users to create their models for implementation if the
standard toolkit does not provide the specific entity that a user needs (West & Birkmire, 2020).
   AFSIM can model all four resolution levels described by Coolahan, capturing each by complexity and time
466 | SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD]

scale (See Figure 11-57 and 11-58). This allows users to focus on the factors most relevant to the decisions
that need to be made from the outcome of the military simulation. For example, at the engagement and
engineering levels, a user may be able to answer which satellites a hypersonic missile would need to interact with
for positioning, navigation, and timing or communications during an intercontinental flight from launch to
impact, factoring in terrain obscuration, jamming effects, and weather. At this level, it may highlight when the
communication windows with satellites would be optimal across the flight path or if a satellite needs to push a
boosted signal at a specific time and place to achieve an effect. On a larger scale, such as a mission or campaign,
AFSIM could highlight the impact of an electronic warfare effect delivered from space on hundreds of units
conducting large-scale conflict in a less precise manner (West & Birkmire, 2020).

   AFSIM is produced at both the UNCLASSIFIED and SECRET classification levels, with the primary
differences being the number, type, and fidelity of the models available for simulation (West & Birkmire,
2020). In the SECRET simulation, approved models for weapon systems and the operational environment
are generated from classified intelligence provided by multiple DoD agencies, much like IMOM. For national
security, it is common for DoD agencies to protect specific intelligence, such as the performance characteristics
of models in AFSIM, to ensure the sources of that information and methods used to collect it remain
protected. Therefore, for users with the requisite need to know and clearance to use this information, AFSIM
can provide more accurate outputs (Diebold, 2023).

EXTENDED AIR DEFENSE SIMULATION (EADSIM)

   EADSIM is a system-level simulation developed by the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command
(USASMDC) focused on air, space, and missile warfare. EADSIM enables analysts to model performance and
predict the effectiveness of ballistic missiles, surface-to-air missiles, aircraft, and cruise missiles for operational-
level commanders in multiple environments and scenarios. While AFSIM can simulate all four resolution
468 | SPACE SYSTEMS MODELING AND SIMULATION [DIEBOLD]

levels, EADSIM is best suited for the campaign (many on many) and mission levels (few on few). Each system
in the simulation is individually modeled to include its command and control, sensors, jammers, networks,
flight characteristics, and the effects of terrain and attrition. (U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command)

   EADSIM has many use cases in the space domain. USASMDC advertises the capability to model and
simulate an active defense, passive defense, attack operations, battle management, command, control,
communications, and intelligence (BM/C3I), Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), and Cyber
Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA). (U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command)

GMAT is an open-source space mission analysis tool developed by NASA, private industry, and many
individual contributors intended to aid in real-world engineering design studies. Unlike the previous tools,
GMAT was not designed specifically for military use cases. Instead, it was built to model, optimize, and
estimate spacecraft trajectories in flights ranging from LEO to deep space missions. (GMAT Wiki, n.d.)

   GMAT contains resources that can be broken down into physical models and customized to meet user
requirements. These include spacecraft, thrusters, tanks, ground stations, formations, impulsive and finite
burns, planets, comets, and asteroids. (GMAT Wiki, n.d.)

mission planners in developing, optimizing, and validating flight-ready trajectory solutions for deep space
operations. SatPro allows users to model a satellite's surface area, mass, and solar panel configuration, among
other characteristics, to analyze its mission profile strengths and weaknesses. The Space Environment Effects
Tool adds variables in the near-Earth space environment to orbit modeling, calculating exposure to ionizing
particles, thermal radiation, and space debris. The Conjunction Analysis Tool includes threat analysis to detect
potential collisions in space, providing users with a probability of collision, optimal launch windows, and
even blackout times when a ground-based laser would affect an object in space. The Analyzer and Optimizer
integrates engineering analysis to understand better factors like fuel usage, satellite coverage, and signal-to-noise
ratio.

   Real-Time Tracking Technology, Distributed Simulation, and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EOIR) models are
the most impressive capabilities for military users. These tools allow users to monitor a live simulation in STK
and incorporate common data feeds such as Link 16, NATO's Digital Motion Imagery Standard, and NATO's
Ground Moving Target Indicator Format. EOIR models the detection, tracking, and imaging performance of
electro-optical and infrared sensors on satellites, factoring in variables such as atmospheric weather, thermal
and optical properties of celestial bodies, and Earth's surface. (Ansys, n.d.)

   AI solutions developed FreeFlyer as a commercial off-the-shelf software application for space mission design,
analysis, and operations. Its core functions include spacecraft propagation, coverage and contact analysis,
maneuver modeling and targeting, orbit determination, attitude modeling, and terrain analysis. The primary
use cases for FreeFlyer include space domain awareness, orbital debris collision avoidance, ground system
integration, automated operations, mission design and analysis, wargame strategies, and constellations and
clusters. Like AFSIM, the documentation suggests that FreeFlyer has a classified software version for use by
government agencies with the appropriate clearance and requirements. (a.i. solutions, n.d.)

CONCLUSIONS

Throughout this chapter, we explored various topics related to space modeling and simulations. In the
beginning, this chapter described space operations from the advent of NASA and the first moon landings
in 1969 through the modern space environment that now includes thousands of operational satellites from
75 countries. Next, we covered the evolving strategic context through the lens of civilian, commercial, and
military space users, especially the growing aerospace defense problem posed by emerging technology. Finally,
this chapter examined a framework for models and simulations and the tools and use cases.

   More than at any point in history, there is a need for accurate and precise space models and simulations to
predict the outcome of any aerospace operation. The space domain has rapidly expanded to impact aspects
of civilian life, generated extensive revenue in the commercial sector, and proven to be a warfighting domain
extraordinarily relevant to US national security. With the extensive and growing list of tools available, even the
average user can learn to take advantage of capabilities in space through an enhanced understanding of complex
system interactions. Using this knowledge, we can apply space models and simulations to use cases in any facet
of personal life, public service, business, or national defense.

DEEP SPACE WARFARE AND SPACE
DOMINANCE [NICHOLS]

PURVIEW

As of this writing (February 14, 2023), multiple intelligence balloons or UFOs from unknown sources have
traversed the United States and penetrated the Air Defense Systems (ADS). It took more than a week for
POTUS to shoot down a Chinese spy balloon. (Gustaf Kilander, 2023)[1] The DoD reported that its first
shot was missed by a defensive F-16 at a UFO over Lake Huron. [2] Chinese surveillance balloons have been
detected over the Middle East according to USAF LTG Alexus Grynkewich. (Paul Best, 2023)

   Since 2018, KSU Wildcat author teams have explored the Risks, Vulnerabilities, Impact, and
Countermeasures for US ADS, specifically for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). (Nichols & al, Space
Systems: Emerging Technologies and Operations, 2022), (Nichols & Sincavage, 2022), (Nichols & al.,
Unmanned Vehicle Systems and Operations on Air, Sea, and Land, 2020), (Nichols R. K., 2020), (Nichols R.
K., 2020), (Nichols R. K.-P., 2019)

   Their conclusions and ISSUES identified were:
   THREAT: The RISK of success of terrorist attacks on Air Defense Systems (ADS) via UASs / SUAS
is higher and improving with commercial capabilities and accessibility. (Nichols R. K., 2020)
   HOW: Advanced small drones capable of carrying sophisticated imaging equipment, significant
and deadly (WMDD) payloads are readily available to the civilian market. (Nichols & Sincavage, 2022)
   WHO? A range of nation-state, terrorist, insurgent, criminal, corporate, and activist threat
groups have demonstrated the ability to use civilian drones and gather intelligence.
   ISSUES - ADS optimized for missiles and AC at high altitudes & speeds.

  · Data fusion works better with larger targets.
  · Reactive for longer ranges.
  · Close reactive requirements sub-optimal.

ADS Vulnerabilities to sUAS

  · SUAS launched into action close to target(s) - ~ 1 mile. Small Radar signature.
  · Reactive dictates quick response near target. Slow flight. LOW flying avoiding Radar
482 | DEEP SPACE WARFARE AND SPACE DOMINANCE [NICHOLS]

      identification.
  · Electric motors are both quiet and limited thermal signatures.
  · Make difficult detection in noise. The urban sphere presents additional problems & potential

      collateral damage. (Nichols R. K., DRONE WARS THREATS, VULNERABILITIES AND
      HOSTILE USE of UAS, 2017)

Keeping in mind the apparent deficiencies in the DoD, USAF, and POTUS responses to simple balloon
incursions into our earthly ADS, we now take the fascinating mental jump to Deep Space and potential battles
far beyond the constraints of Earth. What might the logistics and forces require to fight in deep space? (What
is Deep Space, 2023) Can we imagine a weaponized space domain where military vessels and robotic machines
fight force-on-force battles thousands of miles above the surface of the Earth?

   Rather than the Sci-Fi notions of "Alien versus Human" in such movies as Aliens, Mars Attack, District 9,
Independence Day, Avatar, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica, in reality, space warfare is already upon us. It is
restricted to orbital activities near and around Earth. It is not beyond imagination that humans will make First
Contact with another sentient life capable of competing with us on an interplanetary scale.[3] This does not
consider that our first battles in space will be with ourselves (other humans). Commercial firms like Space X,
Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin are making huge progress in space tourism.

   It is reasonable to assert that state-on-state conflict will be humans' first open space warfare experience.
(Wright, 2020)[4]

   Ye author's sense is that space warfare will look more like and require staged training of forces similar to
Enders Game. What that movie should have addressed (and we will ) is the logistics problem.

OBJECTIVES

This is an introductory chapter to a fascinating science - the conquest of deep space. It encompasses so many
disciplines: materials, logistics, military science, weapons, tactics, operations, HAZMAT, navigation, safety,
security, survival, forces and gravity, hostile environment, politics, First Contact and so many additional topics.
The objective is to give the student a small flavor of some of the key concerns to building a naval-structured
space force that might be able to colonize territory in deep space. This would not be a civilian operation but
likely a military one guided by strategic, survival, and political goals.

   Open sources focus on astrophysics, new discoveries, and public information about US Space Force

traveling into deep space and then launching operations to take territory. Two resources did provide enough
strategy and thought to yield challenges to our readers, and we lean heavily on their experiences. (Wright,

INTERSTELLAR BASICS

In 1961, Frank Drake created a theoretical equation to determine the number of civilizations in the Milky
Way capable of emitting detectable EM emissions. The equation was rife with assumptions that drastically
affected the calculations. Drake's conjecture was about 340 spacefaring civilizations that could sustain life and
be detectable by Earth technology. (Drake, 2023)

   Conflict has existed since the first day that man evolved on Earth. I can picture Adam and Eve having a
heated discussion about dinner. I don't know how it was settled. Conflict occurs because political units use
power to ensure their survival and this use of power affects different political units unevenly. Military force
is a key instrument of national power to ensure behavior and the right to survival. Unfortunately, humanity
has always reserved the right to use violence and coercion. In nice terms, this is called international relations as
using force to obtain political objectives.

   Outer Space Treaty, formally the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and
Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, is a multilateral treaty that forms the basis
of international space law. Negotiated and drafted under the auspices of the United Nations, it was opened
for signature in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union on January 27, 1967, entering
into force on October 10, 1967. As of February 2022, 112 countries are parties to the treaty--including all
major spacefaring nations--and another 23 are signatories. (Wiki, 2023) Unfortunately, only political power
can enforce or reject a claim; only conflict can ensure the final decision. Distances between stellar objects and
logistical difficulties in supplying space forces mean a preponderance of military power in one area or near a
particular supply object force the de facto arbiter of that object's security and access. (Wright, 2020)

ANARCHICAL ENVIRONMENT

Space comprises extreme distances between unfamiliar stellar bodies, which are or can be assumed hostile to
human life. [5] Any territorial claims will be backed by political negotiations that hold interest in them and are
prepared to maintain, supply, and protect their claims. In maritime Earth situations, it is incumbent on vessels
to answer and assist in rescue operations for a vessel in distress. The law of salvage is a principle of maritime
law whereby any person who helps recover another person's ship or cargo in peril at sea is entitled to a reward
commensurate with the value of the property saved. (Wright, 2020)

   Maritime law is inherently international, and although salvage laws vary from country to country, generally,
there are established conditions to be met to allow a salvage claim. The vessel must be in peril, either immediate
or forthcoming; the salvage vessel must act voluntarily and under no pre-existing contract; and the salvage
484 | DEEP SPACE WARFARE AND SPACE DOMINANCE [NICHOLS]

vessel must be successful in their efforts, though payment for partial success may be granted if the environment
is protected. (Wiki, 2023) Because space is a self-help system, claimant states cannot rely on other political units
to safeguard their claims. (Wright, 2020)

   Space is a unique environment. Territorial claims share three characteristics: Technological sophistication,
complications, and vulnerability. The deep space environment is hostile, unbelievably hostile to habitation
and creating a permanent base or settlement. The logistics of supply are a nightmare in a horror show. The
equipment in a simple research lab would require sophistication and stand-alone computing capabilities of 5-G
networks available on Earth. Supply vessels would need to be escorted by military vessels. Communications
would need to be the best that Earth engineers could offer. If a supply vessel arrived late - what would be
the consequences to the lab? Everything must be designed for duplication, accuracy, uniqueness, security,
survivability, replacement, longevity, and balance. It requires technical sophistication.

   Space territorial claims would be complicated. They would be in 4-dimensions (three physical and time).
Stellar phenomena are in motion according to their body and gravity's influence. Think miles cubed rather
than square miles like Earth's territorial claims. Reference points protected air space, and boundaries could be
at the heart of every disagreement.

   Claims in space are, by nature, vulnerable. Space and maritime domains share the problem of pinpoint
location. The extreme distances between claims and the slow speeds of space-going vessels mean the territorial
claim will be unprotected for long periods. (Wright, 2020)

SPACE DISTANCE

Space is so big and vast that it defies our best measurement capabilities. Basic dimensions are measured as
distances between stars and by listing the quantity ( or estimate of) the number of stars themselves. Let's
expand on a maritime example of MOB [6] or deserter from a ship at sea. Both swimmers in the water spot
what they think is land, perhaps 1-2 nm from their location. They make this calculation with their head above
water and in the sea where they are in motion with current and waves. They start swimming. The actual land
mass might be as far as 5 nm. Estimates in water are usually 200% or more under stress conditions. [7]An
average swimmer in 70oF water temperature, average wave conditions, and no sharks is 32.24 minutes across
all ages and genders. (Anonymous, 1 Mile Swim Times: Swimming Standards By Age and Ability, 2023)
Assuming our MOB or deserter is off by 3 nm, his total time would be 161 min for the 5 nm if not exhausted.
Let's change the water temperature to 40oF. See Figure 12-1 Life Expectancy Following Cold Water Immersion.
Our MOB / Deserter has about 1 hour to have a 50% chance to live. Above 90 minutes, his life expectancy
is zero. Even with an exposure suit, [8]Our MOB/Deserter would be in great danger as the nm increases. See
Figure 12- 2 Life Expectancy Following Cold-Water Immersion (Exposure Suit). Errors in maritime situations
are quite dependent on distance and environment and can quickly become life-threatening.

   Now we put our play in space where the baseline temperature of outer space is based on the radiation
of the Big Bang at -455 oF. (Wiki, 2023) Why is deep space this cold? The distance between gas and dust
                                                                         DEEP SPACE WARFARE AND SPACE DOMINANCE [NICHOLS] | 485

particles grows, limiting their ability to transfer heat. Leaving a space vessel for any reason is fatal - immediately.
Protective gear has its limitations, as well as the ability to carry oxygen. BTW, A body will decompose in space.
Although there are no insects, fungi, or external organisms to break down the body, we still carry plenty of
bacteria with us. Left unchecked, they would rapidly multiply and cause the putrefaction of a corpse on board
the shuttle, ISS, or vessel. (Anonymous, Would a Corpse decay in space?, 2023)

   Distances associated with space flight are brain-busters. Traveling at light speed (which is not possible yet)
would take four years to reach our closest neighboring star, Alpha Centauri. Safely equipping a fleet-sized for
deep space travel would be critical to any force hoping to traverse the galaxy. Planners must provide additional
supplies, replacement parts, a machine shop, excess fuel, excess weapons, hazard protections, machinery
duplication, backup communication, and navigation equipment. Multiple navigational hubs and protected
lanes of travel would be required. (Wright, 2020)
DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER
There is so much mystery in the universe. Two components of the universe that have been studied but we really
need to comprehend are dark energy and dark matter. Before contemplating sending a space force to engage
with a combatant competitor, we must know more about these. Dark Energy (DE) appears to be accelerating
                                                                         DEEP SPACE WARFARE AND SPACE DOMINANCE [NICHOLS] | 487

the universe's expansion with time. Discovered in the 1990s from observations of distant supernovas, this
expansion observation contradicted the prevailing theory of cosmos decelerating. (Saikia, 2023) See Figure
12-3.

   The explanation is that DE forces space to expand and gross less dense, thereby driving galaxies and other
structures apart. From a space force POV, [9]waypoints and navigation sets are not constant.
   Dark Matter (DM) does not interact with light or conventional matter. It was initially deduced from
its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the spinning and grouping of galaxies. DM is believed to
constitute approximately 85% of the universe's matter, although scientists have yet to discover it directly. DM
is the network glue for revealing enormous clusters and filaments of galaxies. This has been confirmed with
modern telescopes and gravitational wave detectors. (Saikia, 2023) The relationship between DM and DE is
being explored by NASA to identify the evolution of DE over time and space and how DM interacts with
regular matter and other kinds of energy. See Figure 12-2 NASA Rendition of DE interactions with other
energy forms.

NAVAL MODEL
(Szymanski, How to Fight and Win the Coming Space War, 2019) presents a military lexicon of tactics,
strategies, and objectives to be considered in near space (to GEO altitudes) against terrestrial competitors. DM
and DE are less important in the direct altitudes over Earth's surface. However, our concern is with Deep space.
(Wright, 2020) considers the environment and technologies available for an interstellar space force. DM and
DE come into play big-time.

   Forces serving in space would be comprised of forces structured similarly to our navies on Earth. [10] The
nature of space travel means long, isolated, and unforgiving movement over vast distances. This is akin to
ocean-going terrestrial navies. The cold and lifeless environment outside is to space vessels as the ocean is to
submarines. (Wright, 2020) Space is a three-dimensional environment, and the occupant of any space vessel is
at the mercy of zero gravity.

   Vessels must be large enough to contain supplies, personnel, and equipment needed for spaceborne
missions. Ships must carry spare and standby equipment to make repairs underway; space will swallow the
unprepared or undersupplied. Terrestrial, naval ships do this regularly. Classic naval discipline will be required
to protect provisions and personnel over long voyage times. Establish rank, traditions, and command mesh well
with spaceborne forces.

SPACE RPO

Dr. Paul Szymanski is an SME on Space Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) and Contingency
Planning. He teaches Satellite Warfare classes and is a US Space Forces consultant. [11] His writings are prolific,
and three of his more interesting ones are "How to Fight and Win the Coming Space War" (Szymanski, How
to Fight and Win the Coming Space War, 2019) "Space Operational Art and Design (SOAD)," (Szymanski,
Space Operational Art, and Design (SOAD), 2020) and "Space Warfare Analysis Tools (SWAT) - Summary."
(Szymanski, Space Warfare Analysis Tools (SWAT) Summary, 2020) [12]

ALL OR NOTHING

Major Wright and Dr. Szymanski agree that Deep Space Warfare would be "All or Nothing." They also believe
that the model of Naval maritime engagements has analogs to space warfare. Naval and airborne battles will
tend to be All or Nothing. They will win and live or lose and die. (Wright, 2020) Why? Operating in an
extremely hostile environment means that the slightest mechanical or life support problem would lead to losing
the entire vessel to the vacuum of space. Technological advantages like terrestrial naval combat tend to be
decisive and tower over obsolete naval technology. Naval forces that press their weight upon the opposition will
produce cascading destruction exponentially on the weaker force. Rescue and personnel recovery is unlikely in
space because both the hostile environment and the battle are still active. The longer a battle rages in space, the
more the losing side loses. (Wright, 2020)

SUPPLYING SPACE FORCES - A LOGISTICS NIGHTMARE

Dr. Szymanski presents a detailed discussion of space warfare implications for the Principals of War with a
comparison of terrestrial and space considerations for each of the nine principles in Table 12-1. Principles
of Space War. Dr. Szymanski's vision of space warfare is confined to the upper regions of satellites
and space stations where their electronic signals or weapons reach down to or up from Earth. The
potential combatants are political and known. Major Wright's vision encompasses deep space where
First Contact is possible, distances are great, and the environment so hostile that rescue is unlikely.
Combatants may be human or not. Combat is All or Nothing, and protecting territorial claims are
in play. Those claims might be as big as another planet or mining section on a planet /star/asteroid
or extended waypoint where supplies and personnel are prepositioned.

   We have two space war visionaries presenting their views of the implications of the Principles of Space War
( Table 12-1). Their purview is different in terms of distance and logistics from the Earth. Dr. Szymanski
considers the questions raised if space war is limited to the edge of satellites and space stations. Major Wright
is concerned with deep space and dominance over humans and First Contact sentient or non-sentient beings.
We can integrate/differentiate their KEY positions based on Table 12-1. See Table 12-2 for the author's
synchronization of ideas based on two primary references and KSU's Wildcat research. (Szymanski, How
to Fight and Win the Coming Space War, 2019) (Wright, 2020) (Nichols & al, Space Systems: Emerging
Technologies and Operations, 2022) (Nichols, et al., 2023) Remember many questions can be raised about
each of the implications of formal Principles of Space War. Questions give rise to more questions and debates.
Our effort here is to find the nub of both visions. The doctrinal quotes have several sources. (Tzu, 2006) (USA,
2020) (Clausewitz, 2003) (Wright, 2020)

FIRST CONTACT

The scale of the universe and our slow technological reach for the stars suggests an extraterrestrial (ET) sentient
competitor "out there." It is only a question of when we make First Contact (FC). What would FC look like?
How would FC behave - especially if FC is more advanced than us? Little green men? Bugs? EM impulses?
Carbon-based? More than 1000 scientific movies have produced all kinds of ETs / FC. We, as a population and
especially movie-making bodies of Japan, Russia, and Hollywood - come to mind - always assume that FC is
bad or wants to use us for food or steal Earth's resources.

   Shifting into the FC playground of deep space, it is reasonable to think of potential military confrontations
and countermeasures from a military strategy perspective. FC scenarios carry with them unpredictability and
danger. Is our first assumption to murder the FC ( because we expect them to do the same to us)? There is
no riskier adventure for either party than to reveal its presence, nature, or interests of one civilization to the
other. The very presence of an alien intelligence can have serious ramifications on the progress and character
of a civilization. The Orville, Season 2, Episode 5, "All the World is a Birthday Cake," has the crew meet a
humanoid race on Regor 2 in the Gamma Velorum system. Regorians' FC with the Planetary Union abruptly
ends when two Union officers are arrested because they are Gilia's ( wrong birthday). Regor 2 is governed by
a race that has taken astrology to the extreme. In that same cool series, Commander Kelly is seen as a Goddess
of Healing in Season 1, Episode 12, "Mad Idolatry," because she revealed her presence in a technologically
infantile and multi-dimensional civilization. Her status throughout later generations caused acts in her name
that were hardly defined as healing. (Wiki, 2023)

   FC considerations generate questions such as what intelligence is known about the target species? What are
the interests of both parties? Why is FC being initiated? How will it be accomplished (safely)? Who goes first?
Is communication possible? What will be the long-term influence on both species? And on and on. Nothing
will be understandable for both species on FC.

   However, War is universal. The only consideration in conflict with another species is scale. We will naturally
distrust any non-human civilization. If FC is planned, one side will sortie with force greater than the
counterpart to ensure survival and to intimidate a potential rival from future aggression. Sortieing without a
preponderance of force would be foolhardy and even risk our civilization's survival. Diplomacy and niceness
can come second. Unplanned FC is totally unpredictable. Both civilizations will find any military battle or
accidental damage or loss of life difficult to ignore, especially when diplomacy comes into play. (Wright, 2020)

LOGISTICS - SUPPLYING SPACE FORCES

The greatest challenge to any spaceborne force is its maintenance and resupply in DS. Foraging will not be
an option. Historically, fielded armies needed to carry things that could not be obtained locally: ammunition,
artillery, cooking gear, camp tools, sleeping bags, water, etc. This is not possible in DS. Depending on mission
and scale, any space force might be larger than anything humanity has previously needed. Care and feeding of
human assault troops, officers, crew, spare parts, and specialized troops to care for the automated forces over
vast distances and cruise times border on the unimaginable.

   The numbers and types of supplies involved with an armed force of any size go far beyond ammunition
(amount, types, crews) and food. Everything an individual soldier might need during the day, including
clothing, personal care, camping tools, to body bags, must be planned in detail. Beyond substance, fuel is a
major supply issue, as well as oxygen, spare parts, and replacements.

   When you think about the logistics problem, there is no guarantee that the chosen battlefield will possess
the minimum requirements to support human life. Any assault force assembled must bring everything needed
to support life, including housing. The force must create an environment suitable to human life and breathing
conditions. Even if the planet is life-capable and supports respiratory organisms, it cannot ab initio be assumed
to be compatible with our oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. So, life support and breathing apparatus will be
required. Filtering systems would need to be supplied for every space soldier. Filtering out what? A foreign
atmosphere might contain unknown bacteria, hostile organisms, and unknown chemical or radiological
substances. This precludes trusting a foreign atmosphere until we are certain the atmosphere is safe.

   Breathing is not the only hostile environment. Lifeless balls of gas and rocks circle the suns and moons of
some planets. The size of the chosen battlefield may be a serious problem if the target is both hostile to human
life and populated with the enemy.

ATMOSPHERIC CONCERNS

A hostile atmosphere will fight the space force. The impact of fighting in a 100% poisonous atmosphere
complicates the fighting and necessitates a fully pressurized suit (subject to tears caused by enemy weapons).
Every piece of equipment facility and HAZMAT suits will be at risk of contamination, decay, damage,
sabotage, or decompression, causing catastrophic support system failure. Local weather - extreme
temperature ranges, radiation levels, and winds hinder any assault force. Sleeping, eating, resting, bathroom,
and soldiering in a locked pressure suit would make the crowded spaces on a submarine feel like a theme park
ride.

GRAVITY

Depending upon its location in the solar system, the target planet or battlefield in question may have
significantly different gravity levels than our terrestrial-based forces might be able to endure. Gravity is a
function of the distance of a body from other bodies and also a function of its mass. Equation 12-1 gives this
relationship.

         F = G [ m1 x m2 / r2 ]  G = 6.067 X 10-11      Eq. 12-1

Where: F is the force due to gravity, between two masses (m1 x m2 ), which are a distance r apart; G is the
                                                                         DEEP SPACE WARFARE AND SPACE DOMINANCE [NICHOLS] | 497

gravitational constant, N x m2 / kg2 ; N= Newtons. A Newton is defined as the force necessary to provide a
mass of one kilogram with an acceleration of one meter per second per second.[18]

   There is no conceivable limit to gravitational conditions under which a potential non-human sentient rival
could evolve. (Wright, 2020)

SPACE DOMINANCE

The concept of Space Dominance (SD) has been studied by military analysts and scientists alike. Both
(Szymanski, How to Fight and Win the Coming Space War, 2019) and (Wright, 2020) agree that it refers
to a "preponderance of space weapons, vessels, and other space-going instruments of war which enables a
localized predominance of military power." (Szymanski, Space Operational Art, and Design (SOAD), 2020)
and (Szymanski, Space Warfare Analysis Tools (SWAT) Summary, 2020) goes into serious detail for planning a
campaign to create SD and presents tools to measure the logistics, objectives, timing, planning, risk assessment,
and battle damage assessments for an SD campaign. [19] Space dominance goes beyond the normal terrestrial
or air domain definitions. They seek to seize the initiative, maintain control, and a broad-reaching mandatory
objective for space force assault. SD means maximizing both coercive power and control and the ability to deploy
forces at the time and place of their choosing.(Wright, 2020)

   The stronger space force in a battle, predominantly in space naval superiority and strength, is the key to
space dominance. Space dominance is the first priority. Encircling enemy forces and territory should be a
primary activity. It is tactically sound to totally destroy the enemy force in an "all or nothing" engagement in
an extremely hostile environment. Space Dominance should be thought of as a game of GO,[20] NOT chess.
In the former, the opponent aims to encircle (strangle) the opponent and deny him his strategic maneuver
capability; in the latter, the opponent aims to completely deprive him of individual pieces (assets) or prevent
defensive movement so that he can slaughter his ruler (king). (Wright, 2020)

SPACECRAFT CARRIER

Hollywood thinks space combat will mirror naval combat in terrestrial terms. Further, that opposing fleets will
clobber each other from a distance, and at the center of their strategies are Spacecraft Carriers. The analogous
Spacecraft Carrier battle group to a naval aircraft carrier group is that both require adequate defenses by
concentric layers of other naval vessels to maximize the delivery punch of the Carrier. They depend upon
other air or space defense vessels and escort capital ships and submarines to find, track, and destroy adversary
air and underwater threats. We don't know what the equivalent submarine would be in space. Carrier-based
fighters and bombers could be leveraged to deliver large weapons payloads to enemy fleets. Because of gravity
and the weightless environment, there is a special payoff in space. Strike craft are not limited by wing length,
498 | DEEP SPACE WARFARE AND SPACE DOMINANCE [NICHOLS]

fuel considerations beyond target range, or bomb load except spaced on the craft. Newton's Laws of Motion
favor the strike craft because of limited inertial counterforce acting on the craft. (Wright, 2020)

TARGETING AND PRIORITIES

The final topic of this chapter deals with targeting. What or how do we prioritize space targets? Targets are
selected first for their strategic effect/value. (USJCS, 2023) Operation Desert Storm in 1991 provides a useful
case for the study of target selection. USAF Colonel Edward C. Mann III describes the options. (III, 1995)

   OPTION 1 - Equal Value
   The first option is to attack targets in a series with no regard for their individual value. The strategic result
is a sum of the targets destroyed. The planner needs only to focus on the level of destruction required for each
target, then select the best weapon and delivery system available to insure a high probability of destruction.
The target order is not important. (III, 1995)[21]
   OPTION 2 - Value
   A second option is to assess targets based on their strategic or tactical value. Determining the strategic or
tactical results when they are destroyed is possible based on a weighted scale. Targets are assigned a value based
on priority, with higher-valued targets being destroyed sooner increasing the impact on the enemy for a longer
period. This approach is still serial targeting if the targets are destroyed sequentially rather than simultaneously.
(III, 1995)
   OPTION 3 - Instant Thunder
   Developed by USAF Colonel John Warden called Instant Thunder is termed exponential strategic impact
targeting. (III, 1995) By attacking multiple specific targets against key enemy installations or systems
simultaneously, planners seek to induce a "catastrophic failure" rather than waiting for progressive system
failures under the serial targeting scheme. If successful, the effect is to induce "strategic paralysis." (III, 1995)
Instant Thunder [22] simultaneous strikes in Iraq on communications, power generation, and command and
control facilities blinded Iraqi leadership to the battlefield realities and temporarily paralyzed Iraqi decision-
making. Further strikes induced panic, fear, and hopelessness in Iraqi leadership and fielded forces. (III, 1995)
   OPTION 3 could be used effectively in interstellar and interplanetary deep space warfare to destroy all
targets strategically important and cause strategic paralysis of the enemy.

CONCLUSIONS

While we do not know yet how the U.S. approach to space and space warfare will take over the next two-five
decades, we do know one thing to be true: space combat is coming, as is space mining, exploration, lunar and
interplanetary settlements, and possibly First Contact. Only two nations appear capable of reaching this goal;
The United States and the People's Republic of China. These countries have different governments, policies,
                                                                         DEEP SPACE WARFARE AND SPACE DOMINANCE [NICHOLS] | 499

economics, innovation capabilities, and values. Their approaches to Space Dominance are NOT collaborative.
Our first space warfare may be with existing terrestrial competitors.

STUDENT OBJECTIVES

  · Understand how advancements in different disciplines, such as metallurgy, semiconductors, and
      Artificial Intelligence, are being used to improve existing challenges in hypersonic technology.

  · Obtain an appreciation for tactical and strategic concerns associated with advancements in hypersonic
      technology.

  · Gain an appreciation of the technical considerations to create such weapons and a greater appreciation
      for the science and how the facts measure up to the challenges of the hype.

  · How such weapons require changes to existing strategies

OVERVIEW

From the sword to the rocket, weapons have played a crucial role in warfare and conflict throughout history.
Their continued evolution has often been driven by the need to gain an advantage over one's enemies or
develop countermeasures to protect and create a balance of power that could potentially deter a preemptive
strike from one's adversaries because of the retaliatory consequences.

   Over the past decade, numerous advancements in many scientific disciplines have created more sophisticated
weapons, which require more sophisticated defense systems and a different way to view offensive and defensive
strategies. As illustrated in

   Book 6 - Drone Delivery of CBRNECy - DEW Weapons WMDD (Nichols, et al., 2022)
   Book 7 - Space Systems - Emerging Technologies and Operations (Nichols, et al., 2022)
   the same has proven true with the evolution of rocketry, which has led to the development of hypersonic
missiles, now traveling faster than five or more times the speed of sound (Mach 5+), which is the minimum
for Hypersonics. This technology is considered a game changer because of its speed and maneuverability. In
addition, such weapons have changed the detection paradigm since they do not follow the anticipated launch
signatures or flight characteristics of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM), which most defense systems
are calibrated to defend against. This, therefore, makes existing systems obsolete and causes delays in the
observation/detection phase and, therefore, reducing the time for Observation, Orientation, Decide, and Act
506 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

processes, also known as the OODA Loop, a methodology allowing commanders and political leadership to
make decisions in a quickly changing situations and act upon them.

THE SPEED SPECTRUM

This evolution of hypersonic weaponry is changing how weapon delivery systems are created, launched,
controlled, detected, and defended against. This technology will alter how technicians, strategists, and
diplomats view their existing doctrines, policies, and strategies and the navigating the complexities of revising
offensive and defensive approaches necessary to address this disruptive technology.

   To appreciate the concept of hypersonic speed, it is necessary to understand various parts of the speed
spectrum and how they relate to the speed of sound. Two reasonably common examples of speed notation are:

· 1) The speed of light or light-speed, indicated by light-years or approximately 670,616,629 miles per
   hour in a vacuum (NASA, 2019)

· 2) The speed of sound, which is denoted as Mach speed.

These short-hand notations identify an object's speed between any two points. Mach 1 will be the baseline for

the speed of sound calculated by the formula.

Vs - 643.855 x (T/273.15)0.5                            Eq 13-1

Where:

Vs = Velocity of Sound (Knots)

T = temperature (Kelvin)

643.855 = Calculated speed of sound (N.O.A.A., (n.d.))

In general terms, "On Earth, the speed of sound at sea level -- assuming an air temperature of 59 degrees

Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) -- is 761.2 mph (1,225 km/h)." (Science Daily, 2021)

The generally accepted sonic spectrums are divided into Subsonic, Supersonic, and Hypersonic for

aeronautical use. To provide additional perspective, the table below identifies types of aircraft that operate

within the various parts of the sonic spectrum and the approximate speed ranges:
508 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

TIME IS EVERYTHING
Weapons operating in the Hypersonic realm have the advantage of speed which can be an asset if used as a
preemptive or first-strike weapon in which the weapon will have arrived on target before the opposition can
respond. Likewise, if used as a retaliatory response, the aggressor may need to be more capable of adequately
defending against a counterstrike. For example, if we use the below table, a Hypersonic Missile traveling at
Mach 8 can reach a target 1000 miles away in approximately 9.85 minutes. The same Mach 8 missile fired at
an aircraft carrier from a plane, ship, or shore point at a range of 200 miles could reach its target in less than 2
minutes (1.97). This virtually eliminates any reaction time for the command and crew of a ship to react to the
attack.

   Adapted from: (Drone Delivery of CBNRECy, 2022)
   Time is the critical component, and as eloquently stated by Michael E White from the Office of the
Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, "...the adversaries have increasingly focused on
systems that dramatically compress the timelines and the timescale of a tactical battlefield. These systems
-- including ballistic missiles, ballistic missiles with maneuvering reentry vehicles, and vehicles that are
increasingly hypersonic in nature -- give adversaries the ability to hold our forces at risk from hundreds, even
thousands, of miles away, with flight times that are measured in minutes." (Cronk, 2021).
   As previously noted, a hypersonic missile traveling at Mach 8 can cover 1000 miles in less than 10 minutes.
This leaves Command and Control little time to make a defensive countermeasure or counter-strike
determination and implement/act on it. This extreme speed and the vast distance can be covered quickly,
reducing the time needed to follow a process such as the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop used
for decision-making. Unfortunately, the defender will lose significant time at the beginning of the process,
510 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

where those under siege will spend critical time observing and attempting to orient themselves to the unfolding
situation. This time absorption will severely reduce the defender's time to decide and act. It also infers that it
will be necessary to recalibrate the cycle, which will also require time. The revised cycle will operate within an
even more compressed loop, thus becoming a vicious cycle and a logistical nightmare for anyone attempting to
defend against such an event.

                                                         Figure 13-2

   Sourced from: (Wikipedia, 2003)
   Technology, processes, and methodologies currently associated with a U.S. Inter-Continental Ballistic
Missiles decision to launch reportedly require between 17-20 minutes from detection to launch decision (Blair,
2019). However, a hypersonic vehicle traveling at Mach 8 could have traveled approximately 1,725-2,030
miles by the time a decision was made. Assuming a first or preemptive strike situation, the missile speed has
effectively reduced the time in the observation and orientation phases of the OODA loop. Likewise, defenders
or opposing forces want technology that would provide early detection/observation capabilities and adequate,
if not superior, countermeasures to provide a defense and enable an effective retaliatory strike capability to
discourage a preemptive action.
   Currently, multiple countries boast of having hypersonic-type weapons in their arsenal or are in a near-ready
state.

   Note. The information is based on claims and may not be fieldable devices or have acclaimed speeds and
distances.

   To continue developing weapons capable of faster hypersonic speeds than currently boasted comes with
challenges and a price. Achieving these claims requires new technologies that must span multiple scientific
disciplines.

   However, although numerous known technical difficulties are associated with creating a deployable weapon
that meets the many boasted speeds and ranges, technical advancements in multiple fields of science are
pushing today's myths and hype closer to reality. To appreciate the technological accomplishments, it is
essential to understand the physiological and technological challenges and the complexities associated with
faster hypersonic speeds.

PHYSICAL FORCES AND THE HUMANS
Unlike supersonic spy planes such as the SR-71, which carried a human pilot, hypersonic aircraft capabilities
have exceeded human physiology's bounds due to the natural forces that occur at high-speed maneuvers. For
example, G-force, short for gravitational force, is a measure of acceleration experienced by an object or person
relative to gravitational pull and is commonly expressed in units of "G" which is equivalent to acceleration
due to gravity (approximately 9.8 meters per second squared or 32.2 feet per second squared on Earth). G-
forces can also be experienced during aviation maneuvers, space travel, cars, or amusement park rides. In these
cases, the acceleration forces can be exerted in various directions, including vertical, lateral, or longitudinal,
depending on the specific motion. The force's strength depended on the turn rate and the object's speed.
Turns that require higher speeds and sharper turns will experience higher G-forces produced by centrifugal
                                                          PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER] | 513

force caused by the inertia of the object(s) trying to maintain a straight line while being forced into a turn. The
following is a simple calculation to illustrate G-force changes based on changes in the objects speed:

g-force = (v² / (r * g)) + 1              Eq. 13-2

Where:

v is the velocity of the aircraft (in meters per second).

r is the radius of the turn (in meters).

g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²)

Source: Derived from Newton's second law of motion and circular motion principles and centripetal

acceleration.

   Note: The table compares G-forces on the same object executing a turn within the same radius but at
different speeds.
514 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

   The stress of g-forces on hypersonic vehicle structures increases astronomically with speed and as the turn
rates increase. The same applies to the human body, where high G-forces can produce discomfort and, if
maintained or increased, can result in severe physiological consequences and even death. This typically occurs
when individuals are exposed to sustained G-forces greater than 4 to 7 Gs. It is important to note that
''...fighter pilots often are exposed to higher G-forces of about 8 or 9 because of specialized G-suits and
proper diet and hydration." (Venose, 2016). However, even such professionals will begin experiencing a loss
of consciousness or G-LOC, resulting from blood being forced away from the brain and towards the lower
extremities. If sustained for a prolonged period, it can result in brain damage and even death. If we reference
the previous chart, a pilot initiating a turn at Mach 2 will experience 10.8 Gs,' but the same turn at Mach 5
would result in 62.2 Gs. This makes the human pilot a weak link in a situation where a hypersonic vehicle
traveling at Mach 5+ was forced to take evasive actions. Execution of the evasion actions at that speed would
almost certainly result in a death sentence for the pilot. This is a strong reason for most future military designs
based on uncrewed vehicles. Therefore, the remainder of the chapter will focus on autonomous or remote-
piloted vehicles.

   Please note that the information in the Hypersonic speed and G-force comparison charts will be helpful as
we continue to discuss hypersonic hype and improvements related to surface friction, structural integrity, and
other areas.

AERODYNAMIC DRAG

Aerodynamic drag, or air resistance, refers to the force that opposes the motion of an object through the air (or
a fluid). When an object moves through the air, it experiences resistance due to the collision of air molecules
with its surface. This drag or resistance is influenced by several factors, including:

   Shape: The shape of an object plays a significant role in determining the amount of drag it experiences.
Streamlined objects or aerodynamic shapes, such as airplanes or race cars, are designed to minimize drag by
reducing the frontal area and promoting smooth airflow around the object.

   Surface roughness: Surface roughness can increase drag by creating turbulence and disrupting the smooth
flow of air around an object. Smoother surfaces reduce drag by allowing air to flow more smoothly.

   Velocity: The speed at which an object moves through the air affects the amount of drag it experiences. Drag
increases with the square of the velocity, which means that doubling the speed of an object quadruples the drag
force acting on it.

   Air density: The density of the air also affects drag. Higher air density increases the number of air molecules
colliding with the object's surface, resulting in more significant drag. As Hypersonic missiles move into the
lower levels of the atmosphere, the air becomes denser and increases the amount of drag (as well as lift).

   Viscosity: The viscosity of the air, or its resistance to flow, also influences drag. Higher viscosity leads to
increased drag due to the stickiness of the air molecules.

   Aerodynamic drag can be quantified using the drag coefficient (Cd), a dimensionless value representing the
                                  PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER] | 515

object's aerodynamic efficiency. The drag force (Fd) acting on an object can be calculated using the following

equation:

Fd = (1/2) * Cd *  * A * V^2      Eq. 13-3

Where:

Fd = is the drag force.

Cd = is the drag coefficient.

 (rho) = is the air density.

A = is the reference area (usually the frontal area) of the object.

V = is the velocity of the object relative to the air.

Source: (Drag Coefficient, n.d.)

At hypersonic speeds, aerodynamic drag becomes even more significant. It can substantially impact the

performance of objects moving through the atmosphere and create additional forces such as "Wave Drag" and

"bow shock waves," which are forms of drag that occur at high speeds when an object moves faster than the

waves it creates in the surrounding air. Due to the high speeds involved, Shock waves play a significant role

in hypersonic flows. By its nature, the shock wave is a compression wave that forms when an object moves

through a fluid (such as air) faster than the speed of sound in that medium.

                                              Figure 13-4

   t = time
   s = source
   v = velocity
   Note: "Sound waves from a source that moves faster than the speed of sound spread spherically from the
point where they are emitted, but the source moves ahead of each wave. Constructive interference along the
lines shown (actually a cone in three dimensions) creates a shock wave called a sonic boom. The faster the speed
of the source, the smaller the angle ". (Lumen Learning, 2018)." .

   When an object travels at hypersonic speeds, it generates a bow shock wave in front of it. This bow shock
wave is a curved shock wave that forms as the object's leading edge compresses the air ahead of it and marks the
boundary between the supersonic flow ahead of the object and the compressed, subsonic flow around it.

   Behind the bow shock wave exists a compressed air region called the shock layer or shock wave boundary
layer. This region experiences high temperatures and pressures due to the compression caused by the shock
wave. The shock layer is characterized by sudden air density, temperature, and pressure increase.

   In addition to the bow shock wave, hypersonic flight can also produce other shock waves depending on the
shape and characteristics of the object. For example, if the object has sharp leading edges or prominent features,
additional shock waves called detached shocks, or compression shocks can form at those locations.

                                                         Figure 13-5

   Note: "Passing the speed of sound compresses air flowing over an airfoil, creating a shockwave.- the "sonic

   The presence of shock waves in hypersonic flight has several implications. First, shock waves contribute to
thermodynamic heating, primarily caused by converting the object's kinetic energy into thermal energy as it
pushes through the air. As the object moves faster than the speed of sound, it compresses the air in front
of it, increasing air pressure and temperature. As the object's speed increases, this compression-heating effect
becomes more pronounced.

   The process of thermodynamic heating involves several factors:
   Compressibility: At hypersonic speeds, the compressibility of the air becomes significant because the
air cannot respond instantaneously to changes in pressure, resulting in local increases in temperature. This
compression heating is related to the adiabatic heating of the gas as it is compressed.
518 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

   Frictional Heating: The interaction between the object and the surrounding air generates frictional forces.
These forces convert kinetic energy into thermal energy, leading to further heating. The heat generated by
friction depends on the object's surface properties, such as its roughness and material composition, as well as
the density of the material being traveled through, in this case, air.

   Shock Wave Heating: Shock waves form when objects move at hypersonic speeds. These shock waves
compress the air and create high-pressure and temperature regions, contributing to the object's overall
thermodynamic heating.

   The high temperatures resulting from the thermodynamics of heating created by hypersonic flight pose
significant challenges to the design and materials used in and on such vehicles. For example, extreme heat
can cause structural deformation, material degradation, comprise electronic components, and cause thermal
stresses. Therefore, advanced materials, such as ceramics and Thermal Protection Systems (TPS), are often
used to manage and dissipate heat, protecting the vehicle's structure. The following are some broad
temperature ranges. Please note that these ranges will change based on vehicle design and other conditions:

   Low Hypersonic Speeds (Mach 5 to Mach 7): At these speeds, the temperatures experienced can range
from approximately 900°C to 1,500°C (1,650°F to 2,730°F). This range represents the compression heating
and frictional heating effects caused by the object's interaction with the air.

   Intermediate Hypersonic Speeds (Mach 7 to Mach 12): In this speed range, due to increased compression
and frictional heating, temperatures can range from approximately 1,500°C to 2,500°C (2,730°F to 4,530°F).
These temperatures are more demanding on coverings materials and airframes of hypersonic vehicles' and their
thermal protection systems.

   High Hypersonic Speeds (Mach 12 and above): At very high hypersonic speeds, temperatures can exceed
2,500°C (4,530°F) and can potentially reach up to 3,000°C (5,432°F) or even higher. The specific temperatures
depend on the vehicle's design and the effectiveness of its thermal protection systems.

   To help illustrate the heat intensity generated at these speeds, the following table provides the melting
temperatures of various metals to act as a general reference to illustrate the heat generated by a hypersonic
thermal activity.

   In addition to heating, shock waves can lead to increased drag and aerodynamic forces, affecting the vehicle's

stability and control, which can also cause fluctuations in the aerodynamic forces and induce vibrations or
buffeting, which must be carefully considered in the vehicle's design.
ADVANCEMENTS IN METALLURGY AND HEAT DISSIPATING MATERIALS
The thermodynamics introduced by compressibility, frictional drag, and shock wave heating occurring at
hypersonic speeds make it imperative that hypersonic missiles be made from materials that can withstand
the extreme heat and pressure generated by their extraordinary speeds. Recent advancements in materials
science have led to the development of new compounds and compositions that can withstand many of these
conditions. Over the past decade, there have been advancements in:

   Carbon-Carbon Composite: Carbon-carbon composites are carbon fibers embedded in a carbon matrix.
520 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

They possess excellent thermal stability and can withstand temperatures up to 3,000 degrees Celsius (5,432 °F).
These composites are lightweight, strong, and commonly used in aerospace applications.

   Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs): CMCs combine ceramic fibers and a ceramic matrix. They exhibit
high strength and excellent thermal resistance. CMCs can withstand temperatures exceeding 2,000 degrees
Celsius (3,632 °F). They are lighter than traditional metals and are being researched for use in hypersonic
vehicle structures.

   Refractory Metals: Certain refractory metals, such as tungsten and molybdenum, have high melting
points and can withstand extreme temperatures. Tungsten, for example, has a melting point of approximately
3,400 degrees Celsius (6,152 °F). These metals are often used in aerospace applications requiring resistance to
high temperatures.

   Nickel-Based Superalloys: Superalloys are high-performance alloys that maintain strength at high
temperatures. Nickel-based superalloys, such as Inconel and Hastelloy, display excellent resistance to heat and
oxidation. They are commonly used in the hot sections of jet engines and can also be considered for hypersonic
applications.

   Graphene: Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. It has exceptional
mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Graphene can handle high temperatures and has excellent
thermal conductivity. However, it is still in the early development and large-scale production stages.

   If one were to review the history of high-speed flight, one could observe the changes that have occurred over
time with the increase in speed and the need for improved materials.

   This chapter only covers a few areas currently developing materials for hypersonic applications. This is an
arena of active research with new materials and composites constantly being explored.
   In addition to improving heat tolerance, it is critical to dissipate heat through Thermal Protection Systems
(TPS) improvements via more advanced protective materials and techniques. Heat dissipation is usually
addressed via aerodynamic/structural design and the implementation of effective Heat Management Systems
(HMS) that quickly redistribute heat to protect airframes and electronic instruments. This becomes a critical
engineering challenge due to the rapid changes in pressure and temperature that can pose significant risks to
electronic components. For example, almost all electronic components are joined with a form of solder. One
such solder is Eutectic Gold Tin "(Gold-tin (AuSn) solder is a eutectic alloy composed of 80% gold and 20% tin
by weight, with a melting point of 280°C (536°F)." (Electricity - Magnetism, 2023). Other specialized alloys
are reported to have melting points of 1000 degrees Celsius (1,832°F) in brazing applications. In the situation
with Eutectic Gold Tin "(Gold-tin (AuSn) solder, if the internal temperature exceeded the melting point of
280°C (536°F), the solder would begin to melt and loosen the connections between components. This is just
one example, but other components are also directly affected by heat. Fortunately, decades of information
collected for satellite research, development, and actual launches, have derived many operational limits for
522 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

instrumentation. However, regardless of the structure's heat resistance to melting, "The maximum structure
temperature is still far higher than the temperatures that would cause degradation and failure to electronic
components...Components can be subjected to temperatures as low as -55°C (-67°F) and as high as 125°C
(257°F)... These thermal conditions induce several failure modes, including package and die cracking, bond-
wire breakage, moisture ingress, die delamination, tin whisker growth, and solder-joint failure." (Electronic
Products, 2019).

                                Figure 13-7 Comparative Speeds and Temperatures

   Note: The temperature will vary based on the material and aerodynamic design of the vehicles.
   As illustrated in the above chart, thermal management must be applied and maintained to ensure the
instrumentation needed for computation, navigation, directional control, communications, and other
management functions are not compromised.
   Heat Management Systems (HMS) research has expanded in many areas to address challenges discovered
due to heat generated from hypersonic velocities. These systems are designed to dissipate or absorb excessive
heat, prevent damage to critical components and ensure the missile's performance. The following are a few
examples:
   Heat Sinks and Radiators: Heat sinks and radiators dissipate excess heat from critical components. These
systems typically use high-conductivity materials and structures, such as heat pipes or cooling fins, to absorb
                                                          PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER] | 523

and transfer heat from sensitive areas. Radiators provide a surface for heat to radiate into the surrounding
environment, helping to cool down the missile.

   Active Cooling: In some cases, hypersonic missiles utilize active cooling techniques to manage heat. This
can involve circulating a coolant, such as a liquid or gas, through channels within the missile's structure to
absorb and carry away heat from critical components. Active cooling systems, though more complex, can
provide efficient heat transfer and enable sustained operation under high-temperature conditions.

   Insulation: Insulation materials are used to minimize heat transfer between the hot exterior environment
and the internal components of the missile. Multi-layered insulation (MLI) blankets or other low-thermal-
conductivity materials create a thermal barrier and protect sensitive components from excessive heat exposure.

   Thermal Management Design: The overall design of the missile, including its shape and configuration, is
optimized to manage heat. By carefully shaping the missile's body and incorporating aerodynamic features, it
can help control the intensity of heat generated during flight and minimize its impact on critical components.

                                                         Figure 13-8
                                      Examples Of Various Cooling Techniques

   Of particular interest for sustained hypersonic flight are the various types of active cooling systems; some
hypersonic missiles may employ active thermal control systems that use advanced techniques to manage heat.
These systems can include various methods, such as regenerative cooling, film cooling, and other cooling
technologies, to effectively control the temperature and protect critical components:
   Regenerative Cooling: Regenerative cooling is a common active cooling technique in hypersonic missiles.
In this method, a coolant, such as liquid hydrogen or fuel, is circulated through channels or tubes in the
missile's structure, typically around the combustion chamber or nozzle. The coolant absorbs heat from the hot
surfaces and then passes through a heat exchanger to cool down before being recirculated. This continuous
circulation of the coolant helps maintain the temperature within acceptable limits.
   Film Cooling: Film cooling is another active technique employed in hypersonic missiles. It involves the
release of a thin film of coolant, usually a liquid or gas, over hot surfaces. The coolant forms a protective layer
that helps reduce the heat transfer to the structure. The coolant film can be sprayed from small orifices or
delivered through porous materials on the missile's surface.
   Transpiration Cooling: Transpiration cooling involves using porous materials or coatings on the missile's
surfaces. Coolant is supplied to the porous material, which then permeates through the material and
evaporates on the outer surface. This evaporation absorbs heat from the surface, effectively cooling it.
   The specific cooling system used in a hypersonic missile depends on various factors, including the missile's
design, materials, operating conditions, and mission requirements. Each cooling system has advantages and
limitations, and the choice of the cooling technique is determined by weight, complexity, and reliability and
will require performance trade-offs.
   Progress in airframe design and maneuverability
   Recent advancements have focused on increasing maneuverability by making vehicles more agile. This
agility will aid in avoiding enemy defenses and better enable them to hit their targets more accurately. Some
notable improvements in this area have been:
   Aerodynamic Shape Optimization: Advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques,
combined with powerful computing resources, allow for detailed analysis and optimization of the airframe's
shape. This involves refining the vehicle's external contours to minimize drag and enhance aerodynamic
efficiency at hypersonic speeds. Improving the vehicle's aerodynamic shape helps reduce heat generation and
enables more efficient propulsion.
   Maneuvering and Control Systems: Hypersonic vehicles require advanced maneuvering and control
systems to navigate the challenging flight demands. Developing advanced flight control algorithms, reaction
                                                          PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER] | 525

control systems, and aerodynamic control surfaces enables better maneuverability, stability, and control
authority during hypersonic flight. These systems allow for precise trajectory control, maneuver execution, and
vehicle stability.

   Variable Geometry: Some hypersonic airframe designs incorporate variable geometry features, such as
adjustable wings or control surfaces. Variable geometry allows the vehicle to optimize its configuration based
on different flight conditions, including changing aerodynamic forces, center of gravity, and stability
requirements. This flexibility enhances performance and control across various flight conditions or
requirements.

   Active Flow Control: Active flow control techniques involve manipulating the airflow around the airframe
using sensors, actuators, and intelligent control systems. These systems can enhance aerodynamic efficiency,
reduce drag, and improve stability and control by manipulating boundary layer flow or employing adaptive
control surfaces. Active flow control enables better vehicle response, improved maneuverability, and increased
overall performance.

   Integrated Vehicle Design: Advancements in hypersonic vehicle design involve considering the vehicle as
a whole system rather than individual components. To achieve overall performance improvements, integrated
vehicle design approaches optimize the interactions between various subsystems, such as aerodynamics,
propulsion, structures, and controls. This holistic design approach ensures efficient use of resources, minimizes
weight, maximizes performance, and enhances maneuverability.

   The concept of Variable Geometry, also known as Morphing airframes, is a product of the holistic design
approach. It refers to the design and technology that allows for changes in the shape or configuration of
an aircraft's structure during flight. This capability offers several potential benefits, including improved
aerodynamic performance, increased maneuverability, reduced drag, enhanced fuel efficiency, and adaptability
to varying flight conditions. Here are some key aspects and examples of morphing airframe technologies:

   Shape-Changing Structures: Morphing airframes incorporate structures that can change shape or
configuration to optimize performance. This can involve using flexible and intelligent materials or mechanisms
for controlled deformation. For example, variable camber wings can change the curvature of the wing surface
to improve lift characteristics and control.

   Adaptive Wing Morphing: Adaptive wing morphing focuses on changing the wing shape to adjust to
different flight conditions. This can include altering wing sweep, span, chord length, or twist. By adjusting
the wing's geometry, aircraft can optimize their performance across various flight conditions, from subsonic to
supersonic or hypersonic speeds.

   Active Flow Control: Morphing airframes can incorporate active flow control technologies, such as
synthetic jet actuators or fluidic devices, to manipulate the airflow over the aircraft's surfaces. These devices can
create localized changes in airflow patterns, reduce drag, enhance stability, and improve control authority.

   Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs): SMAs can undergo deformation and return to their original shape when
subjected to specific stimuli, such as electrical or temperature changes or mechanical stress. By integrating
526 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

SMAs into the airframe structure, components can change shape or position in response to different flight
conditions.

   Distributed Control Systems: Morphing airframes require sophisticated control systems to monitor flight
conditions and adjust the shape or configuration of the aircraft accordingly. These systems often use sensor
arrays, computational algorithms, and actuators to enable real-time adjustments to provide safeguards and
ensure optimal performance.

   Biomimicry: Morphing airframe designs can draw inspiration from nature, imitating the adaptive features
of birds, insects, or marine animals. For instance, the ability of birds to change wing shape during flight has
inspired the development of biomimetic morphing wing designs.

                                                         Figure 13-9

   Note: Different morphing configurations can provide the ultimate configuration relative to the action
performed. The above image has standard flight, Lottering, and dash configurations.

overview.pdf (Yang, Nangia, & Cooper, 2014)

   Morphing airframes are a promising research area in the early stages. However, as previously stated, these
require continued study and advancements in materials science, control systems, and manufacturing
techniques to enable a morphing airframe that could meet military demands.

ADVANCEMENTS IN COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
(AI)

Developing computers for hypersonic missiles is crucial in achieving the desired performance, accuracy, and
responsiveness intended for such weapons. Achieving such will require sophisticated onboard computers to
handle real-time complex tasks. The following are some critical aspects of computer development that will be
impacting to the advancement of hypersonic missiles:

   Radiation-Hardened Processors: Hypersonic missiles often operate in environments with high radiation
levels, such as during space travel or atmospheric re-entry. To ensure the reliability of onboard electronics,
radiation-hardened processors are used. These processors are designed to withstand the effects of radiation and
prevent malfunctions caused by radiation-induced errors.

   High-Performance Processors: The need for powerful processors capable of executing complex
algorithms quickly and accurately are required for hypersonic activity. These processors must handle
navigation, guidance, control, and sensor data processing tasks at extremely high speeds. Specialized high-
performance computing architectures such as Multi-Core Processing are often employed to meet these
requirements.

   Real-Time Operating Systems: To ensure timely execution of critical functions, hypersonic missiles
typically use real-time operating systems (RTOS). RTOS prioritizes tasks based on their urgency, minimizing
the possibility of delays, and ensuring precise control and responsiveness during flight. Some RTOSs allow
for separating critical and non-critical software components, enabling the coexistence of multiple operating
systems or applications on the same hardware platform.

   Navigation and Guidance Algorithms: Sophisticated navigation and guidance algorithms are essential
for hypersonic missiles to maintain their intended trajectory and accurately hit their targets. These algorithms
continuously analyze sensor data, such as GPS signals and inertial measurements, to compute optimal flight
paths and adjust course corrections in real time.

   Sensor Fusion: Hypersonic missiles rely on various sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs),
GPS receivers, and advanced imaging or target-tracking sensors, to gather data about their surroundings and
targets. Sensor fusion algorithms integrate information from these diverse sources to enhance situational
awareness and improve the missile's ability to identify and engage targets.
528 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

   Autonomous Decision-Making: Hypersonic missiles often operate in contested and rapidly changing
environments. As a result, they may need to make autonomous decisions to adapt to unexpected scenarios
or countermeasures. Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms are integrated into
missile computers to provide intelligent decision-making capabilities.

      Figure 13-10 Sample Of High-Level Architecture For U Coupling With A Refueling Drogue
                                                        Coupling

   Note: This does not represent the far more complex architecture and sub-systems that would provide services for
a hypersonic vehicle but gives a general idea of activities that must be accounted for.

   Adapted from: (Wilson, 2015)
   Secure Communication: Hypersonic missiles may communicate with command centers or other
platforms during flight, requiring secure and robust communication systems to relay data and receive updated
instructions. Encryption and secure communication protocols are essential to protect the missile's integrity
and maintain operational security. In addition, the encryption/decryption process must be performed quickly
to avoid introducing delays in the Communication, Command, and Control(C3) flow. The systems must also
account for the ionization surrounding the vehicle at such speeds.
   Fault Tolerance and Redundancy: Exposure to extreme conditions and challenging environments makes
it necessary for onboard computers to incorporate fault-tolerant design principles and redundant surface
                                                          PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER] | 529

control systems to improve the reliability of mission success. This redundancy enables the missile to continue
functioning even if specific components fail during flight.

   Although much of the information related to the types of processors used is classified, they must have high-
performance computing capabilities to perform real-time processing from the many sensors needed for vehicle
operation and make real-time calculations for precision maneuver execution. For example, at Mach 5, a missile
will travel approximately 1 mile a second. There is no time for delayed calculations or signal delivery to critical
maneuvering components. Such development is a multidisciplinary endeavor involving aerospace engineering,
computer science, electronics, system integration, and manufacturing expertise.

   In addition, to improve computing hardware. It is crucial that the software be equally as efficient and can
perform exceptional analytics. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a role in various aspects, including guidance,
navigation, control (GNC), target acquisition, and autonomous decision-making. Here are some specific AI
uses in hypersonic missiles:
   Data Processing and Fusion: Vast quantities of data are generated from onboard sensors and external
sources. AI can assist in processing and fusing this data to provide a comprehensive situational awareness for
the missile's guidance and decision-making systems. Machine learning algorithms can integrate and analyze
information from multiple sources to generate accurate and real-time assessments for flight duration.
   GNC Optimization: AI can optimize hypersonic missiles' guidance, navigation, and control algorithms
to enhance flight performance and accuracy. Machine learning techniques can analyze vast data to improve
trajectory planning, control surface adjustment, and overall flight stability.
   Target Recognition and Tracking: AI can analyze sensor data, such as radar and infrared imaging, to
detect, identify, and track targets. Machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns and signatures associated
with various types of targets, improving the missile's ability to acquire and engage them. This same technology
is beneficial in countermeasures used to detect hypersonic missiles during various stages of flight.
   Autonomous Targeting: AI can autonomously select and prioritize targets based on predefined criteria.
Integrating AI algorithms into the missile's system allows it to analyze real-time data, assess threats, and make
decisions on target engagement without human intervention.
   Countermeasures and Adaptability: Hypersonic missiles must evade potential enemy defenses and react
to changing scenarios. AI algorithms can assess and respond to incoming threats, identify countermeasures,
and adapt the missile's trajectory or tactics accordingly. This adaptability can enhance the missile's survivability
and increase the likelihood of mission success.

   AI applications augmented with machine learning have the potential to evade enemy countermeasures
and reconfigure themselves based on current circumstances and situational awareness. This capability will
allow the device to react to unplanned encounters and revise operational requirements based on current
environmental and available operational information or decide without such data.

ENHANCEMENTS TO DELIVERY SYSTEMS
To appropriately frame the concept of hypersonic missiles, it is essential to understand that there are two
major categories, each of which can be deployed from multiple platforms, such as air, ship, land, or space. As
discussed in Book 7, chapter 2 on Satellite Killers and Hypersonic Drones (2022), there is the Hypersonic
Cruise Missile (HCM) has a self-contained propulsion system, typically driven by SCRAM jet technology
and Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV), relies on gravity and atmospheric conditions to produce speed and
maneuverability. These vehicles are difficult to track if released from an aerial or space platform.

   Unlike their predecessor, the ballistic missile, which follows a parabola-shaped arch and has a predictable
flight path from launch to target.
532 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

   The hypersonic HCM and HGVs operate on a flatter trajectory and are more maneuverable. Their agility
provides a more capability to avoid detection by terrestrial-based radar and a higher probability of evading
opposition countermeasures if deployed. Improvements in navigation, guidance, and control technology
make it possible to seek alternate targets within its strike range and even calculate flight paths that would
introduce confusion into opposition tracking used to detect and calculate the probability of which locations
may be potential targets. This type of deception would help impede the opposition's ability to deploy
countermeasures to protect the actual target.

   As with any weapon system that takes flight, weight and flight characteristics become a consideration in the
design, operational range, and speed. For example, both designs require some initial level of flight assistance.
HGVs frequently require assistance from a booster to achieve low orbit and utilize gravity. In the case of
HCMs, a booster or air launch is necessary to obtain the speed required to engage the onboard SCRAM jet
engine. Also, the HCM must carry its fuel and other needed control systems and payload it would deliver.
Advancements in rocket boosters, electronics, lightweight, heat-resistant material, and aerodynamic designs
have made it possible to carry larger payloads, either nuclear or conventional.
   The advent of aeronautical advancements such as the Space Shuttle and Space-X have removed obstacles
that once rendered consideration of some previous concepts cost prohibitive or just unfeasible. These more
contemporary advancements and technical improvements have opened the door for reconsidering old concepts
based on applying advancements in other areas. For example, there is renewed interest in space platforms such
as "Project Thor" or "Rods from God," which refers to creating a space-based weapon system involving kinetic
bombardment. The concept is to use the gravitational force to accelerate a large rod or projectile, typically
                                                          PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER] | 535

made of dense materials like tungsten, that would generate significant destructive power upon impact with
a target on Earth. Once launched from an Orbital Kinetic Energy Bombardment Platform, tungsten rods
of 20-foot lengths by 1-foot diameters and traveling at approximately Mach 10 would have sufficient Kinetic
Energy to cause mass destruction (Stilwell, 20211).

   To provide context, given that the rod has a diameter of 1 foot (0.3048 meters) and a length of 20 feet (6.096
meters) and is constructed of tungsten, we can calculate the weight as follows:

   Radius = diameter / 2 = 0.3048 / 2 = 0.1524 meters
   Volume =  * (0.1524^2) * 6.096 = 0.554 cubic meters
   Weight = Volume * Density = 0.554 * 19,250 = 10,676.75 kilograms
   The tungsten rod would weigh approximately 10,676.75 kilograms (or approximately 10.68 metric tons).
   The Kinetic Energy produced at this weight coupled with a speed of Mach 10 would produce:
   Velocity = 10 * 343 (Mach 1) = 3,430 meters per second
   Converting the mass of the tungsten rod to kilograms (~10.7 metric tons = 10,700 kilograms)
   Kinetic Energy = (1/2) * 10,700 kg * (3,430 m/s)^2
   Kinetic Energy  248,594,050,000 joules or 248.6 gigajoules
   To add perspective, one ton of TNT is equivalent to 4.184 gigajoules. Therefore, the energy from the
20-foot rod would be equivalent to 59.4 metric tons of TNT. This would be slightly more than the 6.4
magnitude earthquake that hit off the coast of Puerto Rico on January 6, 2020, causing widespread devastation
to the southern region. This concentrated amount of kinetic energy converted to potential energy in
milliseconds would have a devastating impact. Estimations would have the rod at said weight and speed with
a 50-60-degree angle of impact, could displace approximately 23,700 cubic meters of earth, generate intense
heat, and leave an impact creator approximately 49-meters (161.75 ft) wide and 12.3 meters (40.35 ft) deep.
This would not account for the damage created by shockwaves, flying debris, or EMP generation and would
leave virtually no radioactive fallout.

REVISIONS IN DEFENSIVE STRATEGIES
The continued multi-discipline improvements refining hypersonic technology have made it difficult, at best, to
detect and neutralize weapons employing these technologies. This provides for offensive superiority even if the
defending side has offensive parity unless the defending side has developed appropriate countermeasures; even
then, because of the speeds involved, target acquisition capabilities, and maneuverability of these weapons, it
may nullify any reaction time of the defender. Therefore, defensive detection methods must be enhanced to
provide quicker and more reliable notifications/alerts to increase the probability of neutralizing such a threat.
As discussed earlier in the chapter, the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop is a primary methodology
for evaluating subsequent actions and acting on them. The sooner the steps of observation and orientation are
accomplished, the more time is available to decide and act.

   As with the innovations in computer technology, Real-Time-Operating-Systems (RTOS) and AI are
assisting with hypersonic-based delivery systems; the same or similar technology can aid in its detection and
implementation of countermeasures. We discussed how technological advances such as the Space Shuttle and
Space-X can enable the delivery of platforms like the "Thor Project." These have also enabled innovations
in early observation/detection. Such innovation will help improve the "Observe" phase of the OODA loop.

Since 2019 The Pentagon's Space Development Agency (SDA) has been actively partnering with Northrop
Grumman, York Space Systems, L3Harris, and Space-X to architect and deploy a U.S. military mega-
constellation consisting of hundreds of small satellites to improve the detection of hypersonic missiles. Before
advancements in booster technologies, capabilities to reuse a booster, and the ability to return to the launch
pad, deployments of such scall were not achievable. Such technological advancements have made it technically
and financially feasible to field a network of space-based monitoring and communication satellites to provide a
virtual canvasing of the entire globe.

   These new networks of satellites equipped with new sensor technology can detect new Infrared signatures
and pierce the armor of plasma stealth. In many cases, as the missile reaches such high velocities, it experiences
extreme aerodynamic heating due to air compression, leading to a plasma cloud around the missile. Plasma
stealth, also known as active plasma-based stealth, is a proposed technique for reducing the radar detectability
of an aircraft or missile by creating a plasma cloud around it.
   The idea behind plasma stealth is to use the high temperatures generated by the hypersonic flight to create
a layer of ionized gas, or plasma, around the missile. This plasma cloud could interfere with radar signals and
reduce the missile's detectability. The ionized gas would reflect, absorb, or scatter the incoming radar waves,
making it more difficult for radar systems to detect and track the missile accurately.
   The exact speed at which a plasma cloud forms can vary, but it generally occurs from Mach 7 to Mach 10
(approximately 2,390 to 3,430 meters per second at sea level). At these speeds, the air surrounding the missile
                                                          PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER] | 539

becomes so highly energized that the electrons and ions dissociate from their atoms, forming a conductive
plasma.

   Although Plasma Stealth can provide a viable stealth value from radar to such missiles, the ionization of air
that provides this stealth can itself be detected because it will leave a Plasma footprint which, although is shortly
lived (milliseconds), can be detected from satellites property equipped (Harshitha & Baskaradas, 2023). As
discussed, the legacy technology was optimized for launching and tracking ICBMs with satellites that would
detect the large plums and exhaust from silos and ground-based radar sensitive to the distinct heat signatures
and radar reflections of

                                                        Figure 13-20

   Such missile launches.

LAYERED DEFENSE
Due to new technology in the area of Electro-optical Infrared (EO/IR), it is possible to detect hypersonic
missiles transitioning from glide to terminal phases of their flight profiles. In addition, the development
of a Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS),
540 | PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER]

in a constellation configuration, can perform detections from the moment of launch and track the missile
to completion. Advancements in AI are aiding in friend-or-foe identification, Battle Management,
Communication, Command, and Control. The combination of these technologies will be part of a multi-
layer defense strategy. This would include surveillance and early warning systems that are radar and space-based
and would include ground-based units equipped with inceptors and various types of Direct Energy Weapons
(DEW). Such a defense strategy would incorporate advanced battle management systems to coordinate and
integrate various data collection platforms, including air and sea-based reconnaissance. This integrated
information collection would provide a comprehensive real-time situational picture providing the essential
information necessary for critical decision-making. Because of the speed associated with hypersonic weapons,
it may be necessary to have AI incorporated into the intercept decision-making process. Such a need will be
dictated based on when the missile was detected and its distance from any assets within the range of potential
attack vectors.

                                                        Figure 13-21

   The end-to-end time to iterate through the OODA loop decreases as technology advances. The recently
discussed topics help improve the ability to "Observe" a launch. With the aid of advanced computer algorithms
and inputs from other sources and space-based systems, it, and proper integration of battle management
                                                          PROGRESS IN HYPERSONICS MISSILES AND SPACE DEFENSE [SLOFER] | 541

systems, it is possible to "Orient." much quicker. However, it is critical to have sufficient information to
"Decide" and "Act." This may require another set of technologies that will perform predictive analytics based
on collected information from the previously discussed data collection points to make informed decisions in
predicting the probability of where a hypersonic vehicle may be targeting. This becomes complicated since
the devices are so fast and agile that there may not be sufficient time to decide to intercept, evacuate, or accept
the collateral damage. This may be further impacted by onboard intelligence of the oncoming weapon. It is
feasible that the attacking device may have similar built-in intelligence to thaw or counter any attempts by the
defender to analyze or compute an intercept and therefore consume additional time. All such tactics can incur
additional delays in the "Decision" making process, not to mention political implications, both national and
international, which may be a further hindrance. However, in a pure combat theater, such as shore-to-ship
attacks, or ground support operations, such a decision may be made quicker with AI, and in combat scenarios,
attacks are usually focused on military or war-supporting assets. However, it should be noted that there are
significant moral and ethical concerns surrounding using AI systems to make autonomous launch decisions.
Most militaries worldwide require human intervention and oversight to authorize a missile launch.

   Note: With Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) satellites, improved communications, and AI, it is possible
to perform integrated battle management and intercept activities more expediently.

INTERCEPT AND DEFENSE CAPABILITIES
The final step in the OODA loop is to act once a decision is made. At this point, a critical portion of the time
to act has been consumed in the previous three steps of the process. The final step also takes considerable time
because physical activities include target acquisition, development of a firing solution, launch, and travel time
to a plotted intercept location of the agile target, traveling at Mach 5 or greater. As previously mentioned, this
type of interception calls for a multi-layered and integrated defense strategy. The strategies include current and
future intercept capabilities

  · Surface-To-Air missiles, which include ship-based missile systems.
  · Direct Energy Weapons (DEW), which fall into the general groupings of
Particle Beam Weapons: Consist of a beam of high-energy particles.
   Microwave-Based: Designed to produce electromagnetic interference
   LASER-based: Designed to heat or pulse a target and destroy critical parts
   LIPC weapons: Laser-Induced Plasma Channel makes a channel to allow clear passage of an
electromagnetic stream to the target.
   Currently, the arsenal of fielded aerial defensive weapons is limited to such systems as RIM-161 or SM-3
class missiles. Such limits make the ability to detect, track and communicate timely extremely important.

would catapult a gun-lunched guided projectile (GLGP) or hypervelocity projectile (HVP), are actively being
explored and tested.

   As outlined in the April 21, 2023, report to Congress, which discussed concerns regarding navel
vulnerabilities with existing shipboard defense systems, it was suggested that investments be made in ship-based
Solid-State Laser(SSL) technology. This has led to the development of the Navy Laser Family of Systems,
which include such projects as Advanced Test High Energy Asset (ATHENA), High Energy Laser Counter-
ASCM Program (HELCAP), and the development of the High-Energy Laser with Integrated Optical Dazzler
and Surveillance (HELIOS) weapon systems (CRS, 2023).

   In addition to laser-type technologies, there are many advancements in using High-Power Microwave
systems to perform Counter-Electronic activity. Such systems would damage the electronics of an adversary's
weapons and Electronic Warfare and Countermeasure systems, including navigation, in which the microwaves
would jam or disrupt communications and other functionality essential to operate the attacking weapon
adequately. This is currently being pursued in an effort known as CHAMPS (Counter-Electronics High
Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project) and has been stated as deployed on one or more naval vessels for
testing and evaluation.

   This technology has also been demonstrated in the Tactical High-power Operational Responder (THOR),
in which swarms of UAS were neutralized with microwave transmissions.

   It should be noted that more highly powered systems are under development to neutralize the threats
imposed by hypersonic missiles. However, in the interim, there are fielded systems that can eliminate more
minor threats and attacks from UAS. In many situations, an adversary would implement strategies that deplete
a ship's aerial interceptor inventory or munitions supporting the Close-in Weapon Systems (CIWS). Once
inventory is depleted, known as "limited depth of magazine," a ship would be virtually unprotected. This
scenario has been realized with the use of swarms. Although not at the scale necessary to eliminate significant
threats such as missiles, the use of Direct Energy (DE) weapons would assist with the elimination of more
minor threats, such as drones, and maintain the consumable assets for the more significant threats, such as a
hypersonic missile attack.

SUMMARY

Hypersonic weapons are real and have been in existence since the 1960s. As technology has advanced, so
has the ability to develop and field more advanced weapons. However, the types of hypersonic weapons the
current world powers boasted about continue to partially defy the physics and currently available materials
and technology to support the brags, boast, and hype. However, research into heat-resistant compounds,
streamlined aerial designs, computer components, sensor development, satellite constellations, combat
management systems, and Artificial Intelligence continue to bring these aspirations into the realm of feasibility
and continue to improve the first-strike dominance of whom every achieves such. Likewise, the same multi-
discipline technological advancements are being undertaken to develop countermeasures to neutralize such
attacks to maintain a balance of power.

   Overall, the advancements in hypersonic missile technology are making these weapons even faster and more
effective. The continued development also raises concerns about the risks of accidental or intentional use and
the potential to destabilize the concept of offensive parity and mutually assured destruction as deterrents. Due
to the sheer speed and agility of hypersonic weapons, which will only become faster and more maneuverable,
will be required nations to adopt new strategies that may require launch decisions to be made by AI as opposed
to humans intervention and the adoption of revised launch-on-detection (LOD) policies where the defender
must launch any countermeasure and retaliatory actions on detection of what is perceived to be an enemy's
launch as a last-ditch effort to provide the highest probability of survival. Such strategies will continue to
heighten tensions and fuel the inevitable cycle of competitive superiority.

THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE -
FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT]

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW:

                                                      COLD WAR

At the end of the second world war, the rapid advancement of both jet and rocket technologies was
overshadowed by the introduction of nuclear weaponry. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
demonstrated the raw destructive power of atomic bombs to the rest of the world. Shortly after, the Soviet
Union conducted its own first successful nuclear tests. This, if anything, was the primary driver for the
competition between the US and USSR that would soon become the Cold War. The race for military
superiority eventually spilled beyond Earth's atmosphere. Beginning with the Sputnik launch of 1957, a great
fear of nuclear weapons being launched from orbit was now taking shape amongst both the public and
governments alike. Although these types of weapons were never actually launched into space, surveillance
soon became the real threat. Thus, both the United States and the Soviet Union began developing the first
satellite killers. These anti-satellite weapons, often referred to as ASATs, were developed as early as May of
1958 during the Bold Orion program (Lethbridge, 1996). This saw the testing of the ALBM-199B, a ballistic
missile launched from a B-47. In the decade that followed, other forms of ASAT weapons soon took shape. The
USSR even went so far as to develop nuclear-tipped interceptors several years later (Grego, 2012). Eventually,
international agreements were reached such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963. While these types of bans
altered both the US and USSR's approach to ASAT weapon development, they never fully put a stop to them.
Within the first year of the so-called Space Race, threats against man-made satellites were already taking shape
in the form of early ASAT systems. Many of these systems were designed by the Roscosmos group. Today,
Roscosmos acts as the de facto continuation of the legacy soviet program and acts as the country's federal space
agency, functionally the same as NASA's role in the US.

CHINESE ENTRY
Despite the end of the first Cold War between the US and USSR, the situation in space has only become more
complicated. This is largely due to the entry of new factions in space. The most significant example, at least on
the international level, is China, which began its own space program shortly after the US and USSR. However,
the program remained small due to limited funding for the majority of the Cold War. In 1970, the first Chinese
satellite was successfully launched into orbit, making it the fifth nation to do so (Futron Corporation, 2003).
Towards the end of the 20th century, there was a major upscale in Chinese space activity due to a rapid increase
in funding. This activity has only intensified into the 21st century and, while the US still dominates in overall
yearly spending on its space programs, China has been steadily closing the gap ever since the ~2000 spending
boom. Additionally, the country has followed a similar path to the US and Russia with ASAT development.
On January 11th, 2007, China's first successful ASAT test using a ballistic missile was conducted, making it
the third country to do so since the US and USSR in the 1980s (Kan, 2007). It is clear now that China has
matured as the next national player of a newly revived space race.

CORPORATIZATION

Despite the entry of new international competitors, the US government has responded with little increases in
spending on its own space programs. NASA was eventually forced to end the Space Shuttle program in 2011.
While the US still maintained a presence on the International Space Station, it did so with the needed help of
the Russian Soyuz rocket, which served to fill the void left by the Space Shuttle. However, NASA is no longer
the only US-based organization specializing in space-bound missions. Private corporations that specialize in
these types of missions are now often referred to as Launch Service Providers (LSP) (McCall, 2020), have
emerged as a major game changer and have kicked off a new Space Race. This time, it is a race more specifically
focused on satellite deployment. As of 2023, the largest corporate player so far, in terms of both overall rocket
launches as well as satellite deployment, is SpaceX, which began operations in the early 2000s (SpaceX, 2023).
Although new to the business of satellite deployment, SpaceX alone has made significant strides through an
economically sustainable business model and the development of innovative rocket technology. In many ways,
SpaceX, along with Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance, a cooperative between Boeing and Lockheed
Martin, have effectively replaced NASA as the sole launch provider for satellites, especially in Low Earth Orbit
(LEO). So far, these companies have yet to openly experiment with ASAT technologies, but they nonetheless
pose a potential threat to foreign competition both on the national and corporate level.

   In summary, while threats in space originated from two major powers (i.e., the US and USSR), those threats
have since diversified to other, more independent groups. Although the US and Russia still maintain their
dominance, they now largely do so with the help of their semi-affiliated corporate entities. In many ways, this
has made the situation in orbit unprecedentedly complicated. The following sections will attempt to provide a
breakdown of the most serious threats posed against satellites today.
THE CURRENT SITUATION:

                                       PLAYERS INVOLVED, INTERESTS
The faction associated with the US and its post-Cold War allies is the most complicated so this will be
assessed first, starting with the US government. While NASA still plays an active role in the deployment
and maintenance of satellite systems, it no longer receives the same support as it once did before the end
                                                   THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT] | 555

of the Cold War and subsequent collapse of the USSR. Over the course of the three decades since, federal
funding for NASA has fluctuated, but overall alteration has been limited. Since 1991, the yearly budget has
averaged at just over 20 billion USD (Roberts & Harrison, 2022). However, when adjusted for inflation
and considering its shrinking proportion of the US government's total budget, these figures do not seem as
optimistic. While the NASA budget Inflation, in particular, can hinder an organization's spending power with
major consequences. As such, NASA has been faced with a diminishing capacity to procure necessary assets
to maintain its operations. This has led to the termination of many programs, such as the Space Shuttle in
2011. NASA then turned to the Russian-made Soyuz to ferry astronauts to and from the international space
station with no primary alternative. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. NASA became so desperate for
affordable components that it turned to Russian and Ukrainian manufacturers to make its own rockets, as was
the case with the Antares rocket system (Guinnessy, 2014). This partnership only came to an end with the
Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. In short, a lack of funding drives NASA to make trade deals with its
former rivals, only for those agreements to deteriorate. It may seem like an uncertain situation for the US space
program as a whole, but there is another side to this equation.

   The newest factor to consider in the case of the US and the western powers is the emergence of corporate
launch service providers (LSPs). As of this writing, the most notable of these in terms of development and
contribution to satellite deployment is SpaceX. Founded in 2002, the company has blossomed into one of the
biggest privately held companies in the world. It is important to note that, even without foreign resources,
NASA relies on tech firms like Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Pratt & Whitney to provide necessary
components for every major space mission it plans to embark on. However, these companies have then so relied
on Russian-made components due to their affordability. This was, of course, before SpaceX took over the
market. Through heavy investments into research and development, improved supply chain management, and
years of trial and error, the company has finally been making a name for itself by becoming a primary vendor
for NASA and many other satellite operating organizations worldwide. In fiscal year 2022, SpaceX officially
became the second largest seller to NASA after receiving just over $2 billion from the space agency (Berger,
2022). Only the California Institute of Technology receives more funding. Before turning the page to foreign
adversaries and international competition, it is important to point out that as of May 2022, the US technically
owns and operates at least 4529, more than 60% of the global total of 6718 (Union of Concerned Scientists,
2022). When critical of the risk of attacks against or disruptions of US satellite networks, these figures could be
considered a vulnerability, as US satellites would be the target of attack or sabotage judging by quantity alone.
It also makes these satellites difficult to manage and coordinate, while requiring excessive amounts of funding
and resources to maintain. When looking at the total number of US-owned satellites, approximately 4000
are designated as commercial, meaning their operationality is primarily overseen by corporations. A recent
spike in orbital objects, most notably payloads, has been attributed to various commercial actors such as ULA
and BlueOrigin. However, SpaceX has been responsible for the majority of this growth through the Starlink
program, by launching hundreds of satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) since 2019. The company now owns
556 | THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT]

approximately one third of the total number in orbit, making it the largest single satellite owner and provider
by far. This new development has been regarded by analytical groups as NewSpace (Boley, 2021). This new era
of satellite deployment brings unprecedented challenges, particularly having no one center of authority over
private corporations and NASA alike, and the vast majority of satellites being deployed by corporations with
no direct government ties. Analysts have also predicted that as many as 25,000 could be launched by 2031, the
vast majority will be commercially (Garino, 2018).

   Turning the page to foreign competition, the most obvious faction is the oldest known adversary to the
US in the Space Race, and that is Russia. Despite being diplomatically and economically shunned by the
international community since its invasion of greater Ukraine in February of 2022, Vladimir Putin has made
repeated claims that the Russian space program would push on with its concurrent projects. These include
the Soyuz and Luna-Glob programs, the latter of which focuses on the establishment of a lunar base and is a
continuation of the soviet Luna program. Since the end of the Cold War, the country has ironically become
one the USs' largest foreign vendors in rocket and orbital technologies. The other side to this coin is China,
which became significantly involved in satellite deployment recently. Through its worldwide initiative to invest
in developing nations' economies, often referred to as Belt & Road, China has been able to establish bases and
staging areas overseas and in some instances on the polar opposite side of its default location on the globe.
For example, the El Sombrero Station in Venezuela has been used as a satellite launching facility since as early
as 2005, when the Venezuelan government signed an agreement with the Chinese state-owned Great Wall
Industry Corporation to assist in Venezuela's own satellite program (Krebs, 2023). It should also be noted that
the Chinese have overseen the construction of as many as a dozen ground control stations across the South
American continent in the time since. Chinese expansion in countries on the opposite side of the globe are
indicators of a rapidly developing space program. The country recently established its fourth national launch
facility on one of its southern islands. While Russia's attention remains focused primarily on Ukraine and the
military assets involved there, China's ambitions for global hegemony are heavily affecting control over space.
Between 2019 and 2021, the number of operational Chinese satellites doubled to 500, while major global
investments have been drawn for Chinese startups intending to compete with the US and SpaceX (Garino,
2018). Both China and Russia believe superiority in space to be essential to their national security policy.
Recent pacts between the two countries enforced by common geopolitical interests have created a common
threat-actor for US and allied-owned LEO satellites.

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AND CURRENT CAPABILITIES
As we move into a new chapter of space commercialization the global geopolitical landscape has shifted
dramatically in large part due to the changing power dynamic in space. In contrast to the straightforward Red
vs Blue, NASA vs Soviet matchup of the Cold War, the modern environment of high-tier outer-atmospheric
actors has diversified significantly. Since the dissolution of the USSR, financial and technological resources
along with the ingenuity to use such resources have expanded to corporate entities, specifically those based
in North America, Europe, and Asia, with China entering as a new major player. While the US government
still maintains overall authority in space, it must now channel that authority through a vast multitude of
organizations, both federal and corporate. This has overcomplicated the way operations are coordinated
in space. The voices of authority are no longer just emerging from the White House and the Pentagon.
Executives of companies based around the country and with differing interests now control the means to
deploy satellites. The capacity to do so and the capabilities of such satellites have dramatically increased
throughout the 21st century. As a result, more reliable satellite networks like the GPS and NOAA as well as
high speed internet have been introduced and/or maintained by government contracts, major tech companies,
and private service providers alike. The introduction of satellite-based internet service has become highly
                                                  THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT] | 559

disruptive both commercially and militarily. Improvements in the reusability of modern rockets is allowing
more of these satellite networks to be deployed at LEO and other orbital levels.

   The greatest feat that SpaceX has ever accomplished in the grand scheme of the Space Race itself is its
contributions to advancing reusable rocket technology. Currently we are seeing its attempts at advancing
the Starship initiative which is, as of this writing, still in the testing phases of development. Unsurprisingly
these attempts have thus far resulted in the spectacularly fashioned explosions that the company is now well
known for. However, this is SpaceX's biggest virtue. Its willingness to push boundaries while also being
able to financially whether the inevitable failures that initially arise are what have propelled it to become
one of the most successful privately held tech companies thus far. Without trial, there may be no error,
but there is also no success, and no entity in the United States has undergone such an intense amount of
trial and error as SpaceX has since NASA during the 1960s. While the Space Shuttle program was the first
to actively reuse rocket boosters at least once after the initial launch, a private company became the first
to autonomously return them directly to the launch pad. The B1049 reusable rocket booster, unveiled by
SpaceX in 2018 for the Falcon 9, set a record of six consecutive launches with minor refurbishments needed
in between with another being used at least fifteen times in total (Reed, n.d.) This and many other B10
boosters have been partly responsible for the deployment of not only the Starlink satellite network, but those
of various other companies including SkySat, Telstar, and Iridium (Thompson, 2020). The biggest seller of
these rocket systems, and a major economic reason to develop reusable rockets in the first place, is their ability
to make satellite launches excessively affordable to a growing pool of potential customers. The result was
an unprecedented spike in satellite deployments over the past decade, attributed to the so-called NewSpace
revolution (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2022).

                                Figure 14-7: SpaceX Starlink Satellite Deployment
560 | THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT]

   Source: (Malik, 2022) & (SpaceX, 2023)
   This technological revolution was obviously highly disruptive, especially due to the rapid establishment of
satellite-based internet and communication networks by private LSPs. This can be seen as an economic
threat to potential competitors on the international level, within the private sector but also Chinese-controlled
companies that serve similar functions. Geely, for example, now owns several major automotive groups under
its umbrella, including Volvo, but has been rapidly expanding to satellite manufacturing, and has boasted plans
of producing at a rate of 500 per year by 2025. Another Chinese startup known as GalaxySpace intends on
competing directly with SpaceX's Starlink program by providing an integrated satellite/terrestrial 5G network
via at least 1,000-satellites (Garino, 2018). The true concern isn't the absorption of foreign industries or even
the rapid growth of startups, but rather the Chinese central government having far more control over its
domestic companies than that of the US. The security risks that come with Chinese tech companies involve
espionage, sabotage, and general data mining which have been demonstrated by ByteDance (Roth, 2021),
through TikTok, and DJI (Upward, 2022), the world's top producer of small UAS. Both companies are
accused of mishandling user data as well as for their roles in Chinese surveillance and censorship campaigns
against the Uyghur minorities in Xinjiang. These incidents show how cooperative Chinese companies are
with the CCP itself. The same comparison obviously cannot be made for the US government and US-based
corporations.

   In a sense, the previous reliance on foreign government technologies in order to send US assets into orbit
e.g., Russia's Soyuz rocket, would have been considered a major vulnerability. The potential threat of souring
diplomatic relations, whether due to a war in Ukraine or otherwise, could result in a major disruption of
an already questionable method of ISS astronaut ferrying. Thus, the transition to relying on US-based firms
in times of reduced government funding is a necessary countermeasure to reduce the risk of losing a reliable
transportation system to and from the ISS. However, the US government's newfound reliance on private
corporations can be seen as a double-edged sword, at least from a diplomatic standpoint. According to the
1967 Outer Space Treaty, the US government technically holds responsibility for these firms' activities (Zedalis,
1978). Incidents such as the supposed near collision between Starlink satellites and a Chinese space station are
just tastes of how easily this treaty can encourage excessive exchanges of blame and accusations between factions
without any actual attack even happening (Hitchens, 2022). This is why the increasing congestion of space
stations, vehicles, debris, and satellites in orbit can be seen as a major threat to both the unhindered operation
of satellites in orbit and the US's international image as a competent world leader in space. Man-made debris
is also an example of how human activity in space can contribute to environmental hazards. This problem will
only continue to worsen, as the introduction to satellite-based Wi-Fi internet has triggered a race to establish
the best satellite-based Wi-Fi network in the world. This opens the door for not only cyberattacks and satellite
killers, but the environmental threat of mid-orbit collisions. Tens of thousands of additional satellites are
expected to be launched by the end of the decade.

   In addition to improved payload deployment, ASATs have continued to evolve long after the end of the
Cold War. As of today, there are four major nations that are actively researching anti-satellite weaponry. The
US and Russia have been developing ASAT weapons since the 1960s, while China and India began around
the end of the Cold War (Garino, 2018). The most surprising modern problem involving ASATs, however,
did not involve their destructive potential of other satellites, but the creation of the majority of all man-made
debris currently in LEO. Since 2007, about half of all the debris currently LEO was generated by man-made
events, two of which were direct-ascent, kinetic kill ASAT tests (Defense Intelligence Agency, 2022). Despite
Cold War-era international agreements discouraging the use of these types of weapons, it has not stopped these
four powers from testing and further developing them for use in the near future. Today, the real hazard of
using these types of ASATs is in the potential fallout of debris generated by the target's destruction. This,
in turn, further increases the environmental threat of debris and potentially destructive space objects overall.
Given today's worsening geopolitical climate over disputes such as Taiwan and Ukraine, the possibility of these
weapons being used cannot be ignored

SATELLITE SYSTEM OVERVIEW ; RELATION BETWEEN GROUND, LINKS, & SPACE
A typical satellite system, such as the US Global Positioning System, consists of the following segments: User,
Control, and Space. In the case of the American GPS satellite network, the User segment is considered the
most secure, as it primarily receives signals from the satellites rather than transmits back. The Space and
Control segments, on the other hand, are monitored and maintained by the US Space Force. In the case
564 | THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT]

of US government-maintained systems, the only control points of the Control segment are staffed by US
personnel and tasked with tracking the network's satellites as well as updating and uploading navigational
data (US Government, 2021). This leaves the Space segment, which primarily consists of the physical satellites
themselves. Among the most common threats in this segment are obvious environmental hazards including
small rocks of various origins and debris created from destroyed older satellites. These types of threats are
always constant, yet they are oftentimes overlooked, at least more so than the ASAT and cyber/remote threats.
While theoretically, these hazards will be slowly mitigated with the gradual improvement of monitoring and
detecting equipment over time, increasing human activities, particularly those at LEO levels, are driving the
threat far in the opposite direction, but this is a threat that will be elaborated in a later subsection. The more
immediately mitigatable threats are those imposed by hostile foreign powers (i.e., China, Russia, Iran, & North
Korea) including but not limited to: Cyber-weapons, Kinetic-Kill ASAT weapon systems, and Electronic
Warfare. One of the most common manifestations of these threats is remote jamming. Such as GPS jammers
employed by Russia.

EFFECT OF SURFACE CONFLICTS ON SPACE SYSTEMS

Satellites have become essential to successfully conducting large-scale modern warfare. From navigation to
surveillance to communication, satellites have become smaller and far more numerous in just the past several
decades (Smith, 2011). This is because of the simple strategic advantage of relying on many cheaper, smaller
units to fulfill a purpose rather than a few, more sophisticated and expensive ones. It is also in part the
same reason so many mobile network providers, such as Verizon, continue to expand and develop their
own infrastructure, which is to simply increase and improve overall coverage. With the rise of private LSP
companies, overall satellite deployment expenses have significantly declined, opening the financial door to
many big tech and government groups planning to launch their own networks. The "Starlink" internet
network has been undergoing significant expansion, receiving a significant boost with the 2022 Russian
Invasion of Ukraine. As of May 2023, there are more than 3500 operational SpaceX Starlink satellites in orbit
(Dobrijevic, 2023). While the idea of mass-production and deployment may in many ways improve the overall
reliability of a satellite network, it also simultaneously increases the vulnerability of that system being attacked
from an external force, whether it be environmental (asteroid, debris) or man-made (anti-sat, cyberattack).
The more operational satellites in a constellation, the more difficult it will be to manage each satellite as more
resources and manpower will be needed to successfully maintain network operations.

   In Wartime, satellite control has become essential, and not just merely for surveillance. Russia's targeting of
SpaceX satellites to disrupt the Starlink network over Ukraine was just a taste of what could come in future
conflicts elsewhere as satellite internet networks become globally established. These new satellite fleets have
become critical communication arteries for militaries in situations like Ukraine's. In this case the strategic value
was so high for Ukraine that Russian officials expressed concern over Starlink's military capabilities months
before the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and proceeded to launch cyber-attacks against the network once
Musk announced its operationality over the country (Kolovos, 2022). Russia even flirted with the idea of using
kinetic ASATs against Starlink satellites, even though doing so would be considered an act of war. This is still
a threat worth considering though, as the invasion of Ukraine is one of the only ongoing military conflicts
that directly involve at least one major space power. Losing an advantage on any front, including LEO satellite
coverage, can be a major strategic disadvantage. Therefore, it can be assumed that Russia, or any other nation
in a similar position, would resort to violating any agreements barring the use of ASATs against foreign-owned
satellites if it felt pushed to do so.

KNOWN THREAT ASSESSMENT

                              RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THREATS & RISK

There are four factors that should be considered when determining Risk: Threats, countermeasures, impacts,
                                                  THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT] | 567

and vulnerabilities. (Nichols R. K., 2022) (Nichols, et al., 2023) Threats increase overall risk while
countermeasures reduce it, thereby acting against each other. Vulnerabilities and impacts also increased risk
and compound to each other along with threats. Here is an example of these factors affecting Risk: Suppose a
large cluster of SpaceX satellites is being deployed in LEO, but on the same day, an unannounced CCP anti-
satellite weapons test is occurring at a similar altitude. This would increase the Risk of asset loss during the
deployment stages of the already massive satellite fleet because of the vulnerability of a high target count and
the possible impact of the company being set weeks behind schedule, not to mention the billions of dollars in
assets lost. The threat in this scenario is the unpredictable debris fragmentation generated by the ASAT test. A
potential countermeasure could be an early warning system that somehow detects the debris and delays further
deployments. But given the poor timing and lack of coordination between the parties at play, Risk of asset
loss would still be significant during this event. This chapter, and the research conducted for it, is dedicated to
threat assessment, specifically any threat that significantly increases the Risk of losing US and allied satellites
currently operating in orbit along with those that rely on them. Research was focused on anything that was
meant to increase the likelihood of destruction, damage, or sabotage of friendly satellites. Vulnerabilities
are also heavily acknowledged as they serve to provide a better understanding of the threats discussed in
this chapter. A threat exploits a vulnerability, amplifying the effect on overall Risk. From early assessment
all known threats against operational satellites in LEO come in three forms: Environmental, Remote, or
Physical. A significant increase in overall human activity and general congestion in LEO have contributed to
worsened environmental hazards, i.e., debris. Remote attacks with cyber and/or electronic weaponry can also
be made directly on satellites in orbit or the ground segment of satellite systems through the respective control
station(s). Other miscellaneous threats include the ever-present possibility of internal satellite system failures,
which are less likely and more dependent on the reliability of the provider(s). (Way, 2022)

THREAT EVOLUTION

                        THREAT 1: KINETIC KILL ANTI-SATELLITE SYSTEMS

Commonly referred to as `ASATs,' these weapon systems follow one of two principles: either direct-ascent or
co-orbital, the former of which seems by far the more prevalent concept in reality. Direct-ascent weapons use
some form of trajectory to intercept a target in orbit without putting itself into orbit as well. On the other
hand, a co-orbital weapon system does just that by placing itself in an identical or similar orbital pattern as
the target in order to eventually eliminate it through either direct collision or some form of sabotage (Defense
Intelligence Agency, 2022). The vast majority of the weapons systems being developed for ASAT purposes
are in the direct-ascent category. In the 21st century, new actors have been garnering more attention with
these types of weapons. China's 2007 test of a ballistic missile destroying an old PLA weather satellite in
LEO was the nation's first successful demonstration of a direct-ascent ASAT in action (Kan, 2007). This
brings to light a new arms race that isn't limited to two superpower states and aims to reshape near-Earth
568 | THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT]

space. A lack in international law and defense agreements pertaining to anti-satellite weaponry has allowed
the technology to boom unchecked. One of the biggest reasons the threat of anti-satellite weaponry is ever-
increasing is due to escalating tensions between major powers, not just between the US, Europe, and Russia,
but also specifically China, Pakistan, and India. While the concept of anti-satellite weapons is by no means
unique to the 21st century, there has been renewed interest in the technology for two primary reasons: the
first is that any treaties or agreements that do pertain to anti-sats, the rules are not specific or up to date on
terminology (e.g., what constitutes as "Arms") (Sönnichsen, 2020). A more recent example of ASAT testing
was India's `Mission Shakti,' demonstrated when a ground-launched interceptor missile was used to destroy an
Indian earth observation satellite in LEO on 27 March 2019. The `Mission Shakti' test destroyed Microsat-
R, which was deployed as an intentional target as it had itself only just been deployed two months prior. The
usage of evident `dummy' satellites and their relative ease of deployment combined with an ever-intensifying
surface-to-air weapons arms race highlights the impending threat of a rapidly deployable ASAT system with
surface-to-air capabilities. The vulnerability of highly dense satellite `mega-constellations' presents a target-rich
environment. The future of ASATs poses an even more concerning outlook for the safety and operation of
satellite networks. China, for example, has begun development of laser-based direct energy weapons (DEW),
which could potentially damage or destroy satellite sensors, both optical and non-optical (Defense Intelligence
Agency, 2022). As the usage of ballistic ASAT weapons becomes less practical for all major powers, the
transition to DEWs may come well within the next decade.

                                THREAT 2: ELECTRONIC/CYBER ATTACK
One of the more overlooked threats against satellites is that of a cyberattack, in fact, it is the greatest general
threat when determining risk. This is because every satellite, regardless of purpose, must have some type of
                                                  THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT] | 569

established radio-communication link with at least one control point or ground station on Earth in order to
be useful in some form. This very link alone represents a serious vulnerability by default, and therefore allows
for the specific threat of malicious actors broadcasting signals that could impede the proper functionality of
a satellite network. The aforementioned ground stations are often considered less secure than the satellites
themselves simply due to the ground station's need for network connectivity. This is why many previous
cyberattacks, such as the ViaSat attack on the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have explicitly and
successfully targeted the ground segment of these networks (Boschetti, 2022). In the rapidly expanding small-
satellite industry, the combination of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) and open-source software brings
additional security vulnerabilities to the satellites themselves. In large arrays of small satellites, the software and
hardware rely on some form of redundancy for each satellite to be compatible and communicative with each
other. These so-called "satellite constellations" are often considered larger targets than standalone satellites not
just due to the size of the fleets but the high number of ground control points needed to communicate with
them. Other cyber-security-related vulnerabilities include poor encryption, inconsistent software patching,
and the usage of older, legacy equipment for operations (Holmes, n.d.). Prime targets for cyberweapons and
cyberattacks in general are ground control stations and the personnel that work there. Generally speaking,
the majority of cyberattacks can be attributed to breaches from, usually unwitting, insiders. When focusing
on satellite systems, however, entire nation states are attempting to breach these networks. These obviously
include Russia and China as they each follow policies adhering to the pursuit of data and information
"superiority" (Defense Intelligence Agency, 2022). Russian jamming of Starlink satellites in light of the
Invasion of Ukraine prompted SpaceX to ramp up its operations over the nation. This, of course, has since
made the network a prime target for Russian jamming efforts throughout the ongoing invasion. The Starlink
V1 network itself proved to be highly insecure, allowing Russian military units to single in on user positions
in minutes, prompting the company to relay warnings on how to use the service as it became the only non-
Russian provider operational in the whole of Ukraine shortly after the invasion began (Malik, 2022). SpaceX
boasts that the Starlink V2 fleet being deployed was designed to provide additional security with increased
traffic, but the reliability of jamming techniques has persisted as it will continue to do so in the foreseeable
future. This remains the case for all communications-based satellite networks. In regard to more complex,
direct cyberattacks aimed at stealing information or data, the target will far more likely be a ground control
station and/or its staff.

                                      THREAT 3: ORBITAL COLLISIONS

A new threat has emerged recently regarding the rapid influx of hazardous LEO objects in little over a quarter
century. This was initially a minor threat early during the Cold War, but increased human activities in space
and LEO in particular are gradually turning this issue into one of the primary threats against operational
satellites. It is also a universal threat, unlike those previously assessed, meaning a threat posed to every
stakeholder of operational satellites worldwide. The reason for this is the destructive potential of LEO
570 | THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT]

collisions, whether it be with another satellite or debris. This threat was brought to reality when, on 10
February 2009, a decommissioned Russian communications satellite, Cosmos 2251, collided with the
operational Iridium 33 satellite, owned, and operated by a Virginia-based telecoms company of the same name.
The collision generated over 1300 documented pieces of debris (Kelso, 2009). Objects generated from events
such as these are tracked and recorded individually by groups including the US Space Surveillance Network
(SSN) and the European Space Agency. However, potentially lethal objects that are not tracked by these groups
are the most unpredictable and most concerning threat concerning orbital collisions. While groups like the
SSN are not able to directly monitor the objects in LEO, they can at least make estimates based on previous
events, such as orbital explosions and collisions that occurred and the fragmentation generated by them. The
SSN designates these objects as lethal non-trackable debris (LNT). As of January 2022, it was estimated that
between 600,000 and 900,000 LNTs exist in LEO (Defense Intelligence Agency, 2022). There are also 1300
objects, each with a mass exceeding that of an automobile, which are currently being tracked in LEO

VULNERABILITIES ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
When assessing variables in pertinence to Risk, it is essential to note that Vulnerabilities multiply the
magnitude of Threats. Age, and the resultant decline of sophistication, is an often severely overlooked
vulnerability when referring to satellites in orbit. A more unexpected threat may target decommissioned legacy
                                                   THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT] | 571

satellite systems. These satellites are by no means dead and are still in orbit to this day. The biggest issue with
these systems is that, while they may no longer be used by the entities that were responsible for deploying
and maintaining them, there could very well still be entities using them for their own gain. This is because
satellites rely on ground stations to establish and maintain a stable communication link, otherwise the satellite
would be useless. But ground-based links can easily be manipulated once the founding party has turned
its attention away from so-called "retired" satellite systems. In 2022, researchers intentionally hacked the
Anik F1R satellite launched in 2005 and successfully broadcasted malicious signals (Zarley, 2022). Generally
speaking, the older the system, the more vulnerable it becomes to these types of attacks. Ground station
security is also a major factor in determining the vulnerability of the respective satellite system. Any software
glitch that can be exploited in a potential cyberattack is a vulnerability. When discussing satellites in LEO, first
of all, an immediate vulnerability would be the proximity to most ASAT systems capable of reaching orbital
levels. Since LEO is the lowest general orbital altitude attainable, it is cheaper to launch satellites at this level
than at higher altitudes like GEO. There are also thousands of other satellites also operating in LEO, making
it highly congestive and contested. In short, these are vulnerabilities of any satellite currently in LEO. The age
and capabilities of the satellite systems in question would further determine the overall vulnerability of the
system. For example, a twenty-year-old legacy GPS satellite would be far more susceptible to remote sabotage
due to outdated systems and communications capabilities than a modern one. Furthermore, many of these
satellites in orbit today are operating at up to four times their original life expectancy. The GPS network in
particular is made up of thirty-one operational satellites, the network still operates with at least six designated
"legacy satellites" launched prior to 2005 (US Government, 2022). Under the correct circumstances, the GPS
network itself could be spoofed and an attacker would be able to inject false data into the communications
systems. This could trick the system into calculating incorrect position, resulting in false data being presented
to the user (King, 2020). While GPS operates at medium Earth orbit, other networks in LEO rely on hundreds
of satellites to provide their services. SpaceX's Starlink network is considered the largest by far, reaching over
1200 units in just the initial two years of deployment (Garino, 2018). In doing this, SpaceX has presented
an interesting strategy to address Russian cyber-attacks. By mass-producing and deploying hundreds and
eventually thousands of satellites in order to achieve maximum coverage, the overall vulnerability of losing
service in targeted attacks is reduced, at least for SpaceX and its Starlink users. This is due to the idea that
the producers can develop and deploy units faster than they can be decommissioned. Nonetheless, this does
not escape the ever-present reality that as a system ages, it becomes gradually more vulnerable to attack. This
is a reality faced by every satellite network. In short, when considering the vulnerability of a satellite system,
age, altitude, satellite and control station quantity, and strategic importance are all factors that should be
immediately considered, whether for networks like Starlink or GPS.

THREAT SUMMARIES & CONCLUSIONS

                                         ANTI-SATELLITE WEAPONRY
An ASAT in this context serves the purpose of disabling a satellite by any physical means. These disabling
techniques can involve either dismantling or destroying the device, or simply knocking it off of its orbital path
and into a decaying one that eventually results in its destruction. Examples of Direct-Ascent ASAT weapons
include Surface/Air-to-Space missiles, Kinetic Kill vehicles, Direct Energy Weaponry, and potentially any lethal
projectile capable of reaching LEO altitudes. One of the most well-known demonstrations of these weapons
was the destruction of the Chinese PLA weather satellite Fengyun-1C, which occurred in January 2007 at an
                                                   THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT] | 573

altitude of over 800 kilometers (Defense Intelligence Agency, 2022). Co-orbital weapons are not as prevalent
but can include space mines, robotic arms (used to either dismantle or push), as well as other satellites. The vast
majority of ASAT tests is surface-based projectiles, similar to those used in the 2007 and 2021 incidents. So
far, ASATs have been used solely on one faction's own assets either to evaluate their capabilities or to physically
destroy decommissioned satellites still in orbit, the numbers of which still rival currently active satellites (Slofer,
2022). The use of ASATs against another nation's satellite would increase tensions beyond a reasonable level,
so much so that even Russia will not even risk it. In a way, an ASAT can be analyzed in a similar sense to a
hypersonic missile, EMP, or even a tactical nuke; it is likely that they will only be used as a last resort and any use
of such weapons will be limited. When accounting for debris fragmentation in LEO, however, the incentive
to avoid using these weapons to attack enemy satellites in space heavily outweighs those for not doing so. This
is because of the vast amount of orbital debris that has accumulated due to ASAT tests in the past quarter
century. For this reason, the threat of ASAT usage is surprisingly lower than initially expected, but the ability
for this type of weaponry to create other threats in space, i.e., debris, boosts their final threat level and this time
for all parties involved.

                                                 REMOTE THREATS

One could, in a sense, consider cyberweapons and electronic warfare components to be remote ASATs. Their
end purpose is more complicated, however. Rather than decommission a given satellite system by physically
destroying its assets, these threats seek to gain access to the system and hijack it for another purpose. These
methods include hacking and spoofing, which can be committed in a variety of ways including targeting the
ground control stations established to maintain the satellite system through the `ground' segment. In most
cases these facilities are the key to gaining access to the rest of the satellite system. These stations could vary
in quantity and defense capabilities depending on the satellite network in question, but these stations remain
more vulnerable and prone to attack than the satellites they manage in orbit (Garino, 2018). Furthermore, as
satellite-deploying companies expand on the services they provide, i.e., internet, they have made themselves far
more prone to cyberattack and attempts to sabotage through remote means. We've seen a perfect example of
this happening to SpaceX's Starlink network during the first year of Russia's invasion of greater Ukraine. These
types of attacks, which mostly involve jamming techniques, have been conducted by Russia in other nations
long before the 2022 invasion, but it is a method Moscow has settled into during times of war. On the other
hand, no ASAT attack of kinetic or any other direct or co-orbital approach has been conducted on another
party's satellite, even over Ukraine. Meanwhile, EW and cyber-based threats have significantly influenced
Chinese military reforms over the past decade, often employing cyberespionage against rival space powers,
mostly European and North American satellite, and aerospace industries (Defense Intelligence Agency, 2022).
As demonstrated by Russian jamming of SpaceX Starlink satellites over Ukraine, jamming technology remains
the most probable threat based on experimental analysis. While it may pose a lower lethality when compared
directly to ASATs, satellite communication disruption is a useful tactic often practiced heavily by Russia since
574 | THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT]

the beginning of the Space Race and is currently one of the biggest threats against satellites over Ukraine
right now. As a final note, it is important to consider the unique role that the ground segment plays and its,
therefore, increased likelihood to be targeted in an attack.

                                         ENVIRONMENTAL ELEMENTS

By far the most viable environmental threat in Earth's orbit is the debris that has accumulated due to human
activity in the past half century or so. In fact, overall congestion, particularly in LEO, is a hazard that everyone
now needs to deal with. Upon concluding this research, it was surprising to see just how congested the
overall environment at LEO has become with debris and satellite fragments as well as just how much human
activity has contributed to this congestion. Specifically, human-generated debris within just the past two
                                                   THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT] | 575

decades is deteriorating LEO conditions and has become one of the most prominent threats highlighted in
this chapter. Man-made debris can worsen conditions in space by impairing abilities to monitor and track
naturally occurring and potentially more hazardous objects, i.e., meteors. Debris can also significantly damage
and/or destroy satellites and even create collisions if the fragments are large enough. Typically, the largest
contributors to debris fragmentation have been segments of spent rocket stages and body parts. However, the
continued reliance on reusable components is gradually changing these statistics. On the other hand, a more
worrisome cause for debris fragmentation is the occurrence of orbital collisions, a threat expected to intensify
due to concerns over worsening LEO congestion (European Space Agency, n.d.) Previous incidences of orbital
collisions, such as the 2009 US-Russia satellite collision, and increased traffic in space due to increasing launch
affordability enforces these concerns. Another recent source of overall LEO debris was the testing of direct-
ascent ASATs. The now infamous ASAT demo on Fengyun-1C in 2007 is suspected of having contributed
to increasing debris fragmentation and the overall number of trackable space objects by about 25%. The
accidental collision between a US and a dead Russian satellite in 2009 as well as the Russian Nudol ASAT
test in 2021 were also amongst the biggest contributors. In total, two ASAT tests and one accidental orbital
collision between two satellites have nearly doubled the amount of all categorized debris in under fifteen years
(Defense Intelligence Agency, 2022). Other environmental hazards include meteor showers and solar storms,
but these are sporadic and rare. The more severe variants are also far easier to track and anticipate, providing
time for preparations. Meanwhile, the threat of hazardous debris in LEO is only expected to worsen with
overall object count expected to grow dramatically into the 2030s. From both a military and non-military
perspective, the ongoing explosion of man-made debris has become a top threat concerning spacecraft and
satellites in orbit.

CONCLUSIONS
The so-called NewSpace era has begun with commercial actors becoming the main providers for LEO
launches. This resulted in the doubling of both active and defunct satellites in just two years (Boley, 2021).
Based on the deals made between SpaceX and the FCC for increased Starlink network development, this
trend is likely to continue to intensify at least for the short future. SpaceX's disruptive impact on the satellite
industry as a whole has in turn helped generate threats against it. Many of these threats existed long before
                                                   THE RISE OF CYBER THREATS IN SPACE - FUTURE OF CYBERWAR [FARCOT] | 577

NewSpace, but some are more unprecedented. The issues of debris and overall congestion in LEO is a new
issue that have not exploded in severity until recently. These are environmental threats that were boosted
in part by the general spike in LEO activity often attributed to NewSpace. The biggest contributor to this
boost, however, were kinetic-based ASAT missile tests, making even ASAT assesses a threat in a completely
new way (Defense Intelligence Agency, 2022). On the other hand, remote attacks are the only threat that has
consistently demonstrated itself thus far. Jamming remains a common technique used by foreign actors such
as Russia, while cyberattacks have often targeted the ground segment of satellite networks through ground
control stations. Nationally, China's rapid rise as a space power can be seen as a major challenge to SpaceX
and other western corporate LSPs who have surpassed NASA's capacity to establish and manage satellite
networks. One recommendation, from a policy perspective, is to formally designate space systems as a critical
infrastructure sector vital to both the economy and national security (Gillette, 2021). While relations with
China and Russia are currently deteriorating, some level of cooperation must be maintained in order to ensure
the space remains a stable playing ground. This has been previously achieved through international agreements
effectively de-weaponizing space for at least a time. However, the unprecedented involvement of private LSPs
has complicated the dynamic between opposing factions in space. A common system of communication will
be essential for moving forward. While individual threats spanning from weaponry to debris will continue to
worsen, countermeasures will inevitably need to be developed to further deal with them as corporations and
governments alike come to terms with the developing situation in orbit.

STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE
MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES

  · To understand the principles of manufacturing in space
  · To understand space systems for the manufacturing mission
  · To understand the economics of space missions and strategies

INTRODUCTION

Manufacturing in space is a strategic endeavor that produces materials that cannot be manufactured on
Earth and where processing is affected by Earth's environment. The advantages of manufacturing in space
include operating in microgravity and vacuum, extracting high-value minerals from other planetary bodies
or asteroids, and processing in low-Earth orbits before returning to Earth. Space missions established science-
based manufacturing in space by studying microgravity environment effects that started with the Mercury,
Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs. The Space Shuttle and Spacelab missions generated further
manufacturing experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), such as processing materials without
constraints, casting dynamics, and additive welding, the characteristics needed to invent printing processes
with recycled/planetary feedstocks used in space. This chapter explains the advances of manufacturing in space
and the strategies and economics of missions associated with this activity.

MANUFACTURING IN SPACE

The interest in manufacturing in space is due to a number of unique attributes because the environment
controls convection motions in liquids and gases and eliminates sedimentation, which allows crystals to be
grown in large formations that are very low in defects (the cleanliness of vacuum allows pure materials to
be produced with processes such as vapor deposition creating very pure thin layers to be produced in an
additive manner creating superlattice layer structures, or additive nanolayers). The extremes of heat provided
by sunlight and shade create a dramatic temperature gradient that can be used to produce very strong materials.

   The US government-led consortium known as `America Makes' (www.nasa.gov) is creating initiatives
582 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

associated with `in-space manufacturing' (Figure 15-1) with NASA leading on exploiting the fundamentals of
manufacturing in the space environment (https://www.americamakes.us/).

   The European Union's focus is primarily on developing materials, technology associated with
manufacturing, engineering, and the circular economy using the Fraunhofer Institutes to create the conditions
of manufacturing in space (AM Sub-Platform 2013, EU Powder Metallurgy Association 2014, Volz 2014,
Weinzierl and Sarang 2021, Nichols et alia 2022). The European Space Agency's (ESA) focus on additive
manufacturing in space to develop replacement parts for use aboard ISS is notable and is centered around
recycling, reuse, and remanufacturing. The EU's Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and
Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products (AMAZE) project involves in-space applications as a
core area of its impact on space manufacturing efforts (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/313781). ESA is
funding additive manufacturing on planetary habitats such as the Moon and on asteroids using methods
developed in the US. However, the development of manufacturing standards in space and the international
cooperation between space agencies need further work to eliminate duplication of the costs of manufacturing
in space (Volz 2014, Nichols et alia 2022).

   The development of materials science aboard the ISS has led to the creation of additive manufacturing
processes in space (Momeni et al. 2022). Initial studies on microgravity showed that diffusion-controlled
growth is the dominant mechanism of solidification promoting uniform microstructures (Figure 15-2), which
shows the differences between anisotropic dendrite formation in Pb-Sb alloys and segregation in Pb-Sn alloys
grown on Earth and in space. Space-grown alloys show uniform microstructures because of reductions in
thermal and solute convection flows (Volz 2014).

   Microgravity environments minimize sedimentation and buoyancy of mixed materials, which promotes
uniform particle distributions (Figure 15-3) (Volz 2014, Nichols et alia 2022). Systems used on the ISS
uses a materials science glovebox, SUBSA vertical gradient furnace (transparent growth zone), PFMI low-
temperature furnace for solidification and remelting of transparent materials and CSLM quench furnace for
studying coarsening in metals (Figure 15-4).

   In addition to the equipment on the ISS, a Low Gradient Furnace (LGF) and a Solidification Quench
Furnace (SQF) also operate on the materials science rack on the ISS with cartridges provided by ESA (Figure
15-5). These pieces of equipment provide the laboratory equipment required to understand manufacturing in
space (Volz 2014, Nichols et alia 2022).

   Cooper and Griffin of NASA MSFC published a report that referred to direct manufacturing and stated
that in remote locations such as the Moon, Mars, or other planets; direct fabrication (manufacturing) could
be used to produce items on location (NRC 2000). The report explained how additive manufacturing in
microgravity demonstrated the benefits of fused deposition modeling (FDM) to rapidly produce replacement
components or repair broken hardware on the Space Shuttle (SS) or the International Space Station (ISS).
   Cooper and Griffin conducted low-gravity aircraft experiments to demonstrate the capability of FDM to
fabricate in a microgravity environment. Cooper and Griffin developed a hardware implementation plan using
FDM for further experiments aboard the ISS. They proposed using an ISS FDM device with a 10 cm × 10
cm × 10 cm volume, mass ~ 45-65 kg, physical envelope of 0.45 m × 0.5 m × 0.6 m using peak power of 300
W with an air cooling of 150 W (Cooper and Griffin 2003). Additive manufacturing holds the potential to
extend traditional manufacturing capabilities (Korkut and Yavuz 2022).

   Manufacturing in space allows the construction of structures and subsystems fully optimized to operate in
the zero-gravity environment with impressive volume-to-mass efficiencies (Prater et al., 2018, 2019).

   The percentage of hardware failures on the International Space Station (ISS) involves polymeric and
composite materials (~ 35 %) and are using additive manufacturing techniques on board the ISS. NASA has
developed several ways to achieve this including contracts with `Made In Space, Inc.' (www.madeinspace.us)
to provide extrusion-based additive manufacturing in microgravity environments on board the ISS (Weinzierl
and Sarang 2021). Once printed, an optical scanner is used to verify the integrity of parts made with a view to
create procedures to use metals and combinations of materials (Prater et al., 2019).
   The ISS 3-D printer made its first 3-D printed object in space in 2014. Figure 15-5 shows the printer during
flight certification and acceptance at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama, prior to
its launch to ISS aboard the SpaceX commercial resupply mission. The first objects built in space returned
to Earth in 2015 for detailed analysis and comparison to the identical ground control samples made on the
flight printer prior to launch. The goal of this analysis was to verify that the 3-D printing process works in
the microgravity environment as it does on Earth (Prater et al., 2018, 2019). The printer works by extruding
heated plastic, which then builds layer-upon-layer to create three-dimensional products. Long-term space
missions would enable on-board manufacturing capabilities to supply needed parts.

   In addition to additive manufacturing, other forms of manufacturing such as free melting of metals (Figure
15-6), mixing of liquids for pharmaceuticals and processing of two-phase solutions are required. Additive
manufacturing in space presents new opportunities for recycling. Recycled material has a significant impact
on ISS operations. The disposal of waste on the ISS is achieved by detaching from the ISS and burning in the
upper atmosphere of Earth. However, using recycled materials will eliminate waste and component/system
creation of recycled materials allows feedstock to be produced (Prater et al., 2018).

   Microgravity environments enable accurate measurements of material properties such as viscosity and
surface tension, facilitate nucleation studies, increase the size of crystals that can be grown, and reduces defect
densities from contact with container walls (Figure 15-7). Manufacturing hardware enables the production of
low-mass systems, thereby reducing launch and storage space. Antennas, booms, and panels are designed for
launching and their size and shape are limited in addition to functionality and scale. Manufacturing in space
enables the deployment of systems without constraints. Such systems include mirrors, gossamers, antennas,
arrays, reflectors, and trusses (Kovalchuk et al. 2022).

ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING FOR SPACE MISSIONS
There are wide ranges of process options for the user wishing to implement circular manufacturing
technologies for space missions. Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies such as stereolithography (SLA),
selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, ballistic particle manufacture, laser net shaping, etc., are
available for use in the space environment. Most of these technologies have evolved from expensive systems
producing basic models to relatively low-cost machines producing various components in metals, plastics, wax,
and paper for applications such as design aids, rapid tools, and functional prototypes. For those involved in
the study of AM, growth of this technology has far exceeded the adoption rate of other laser-based technologies
such as welding. In terms of circular economic principles of recycling and reuse, this section examines the
most common AM technologies and explores their limitations and advantages for use in space.
STEREOLITHOGRAPHY (SLA)
In the stereolithography process, photopolymers are composed of Photoinitiators and liquid monomers.
The sequence of the photopolymerization process is shown in Figure 15-8. Photoinitiators are held in a
solution composed of liquid monomers. On exposure to an ultra-violet photon, photoinitiators are excited
and a small percentage of these molecules chemically transform to become reactive species. The reactive
species stimulates photo polymerization through the formation of a free radical polymer initiation sequence.
Additional monomers proceed to react with the chain until the process terminates.

   Commercial photopolymer AM machines work either by laser-based photocuring or masked-lamp curing.
Stereolithography starts with a solid or surface CAD model of a three-dimensional object. A computer
program slices the CAD model into many thin layers. The solid model is built in a vat of liquid resin that has
the property of changing from liquid to solid when exposed to ultraviolet light. An ultraviolet HeCd laser,
U.V. enhanced Ar+, or a frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG laser scans through a series of discrete vectors. At
each point, the resin is cured to form a layer (Figure 15-9).

   The overlapping of solids forms a line, and overlapping lines form a solid layer. The depth of cure is a
function of laser power and dwell time; a substantial over-cure is produced to ensure layer-to-layer bonding.

   Building a solid object starts by drawing the bottom layer of the object on the surface of the liquid resin
(Figure 15-11).

   Source: Author
   CAD data representing a layer moves the ultraviolet beam across the surface of the liquid resin by controlling
the deflection of mirrors. After the entire bottom layer has been exposed and solidified, the layer of solid resin
is lowered so that a thin layer of liquid covers the solid layer. Then the second layer of the solid object is drawn
on top of the first. As the second layer is drawn, the liquid resin solidifies and adheres to the first layer. This
process continues layer-by-layer, until the entire object is complete. The time taken for the process depends on
the size and complexity of the object. After the object is completed, it is raised above the resin to allow excess
liquid resin to drain. Finally, the object is exposed to a flood of ultraviolet light to complete solidification of the
resin. After completion, various finishing processes may be used, depending on the use of the model. There
are now many photo-polymer resins on offer ranging from epoxy, vinyl ether, or acrylate functional groups.
Each photo-polymer resin will have offer specific build rates and produce models with a range of properties
and accuracy.
   The speed of a photopolymer is directly associated with the laser exposure necessary to achieve a prescribed
cure depth, Cd. Most SLA users wish to know how long it will take to make a build with a particular resin.
Information such as resin photo speed will allow the user to make accurate calculations about curing rates for
592 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

a particular laser power. The resin is exposed to a laser beam scanned at a series of known velocities. The cure
depth Cd is then measured and plotted as a function of the incident energy density. The gradient provides the
energy requirements of curing per unit volume, Dp, and Ec, is the critical exposure of the resin.

   HeCd lasers produced radiant energy in both visible and ultra-violet wavelengths. The UV output provides
sufficient energy for curing most photopolymers. Metastable states of neutral Helium atoms are excited. These
collide with neutral cadmium atoms, the upper state of the cadmium ion is excited thereby emitting radiation
with wavelengths 441.6 nm and 325 nm, which are visible light and ultra-violet light, respectively.

   To calculate parameters that will illuminate the SLA AM process, the interaction of light with resin needs
to be understood. Radiation that has been transmitted to the surface is absorbed according to Beer-Lambert's
law, I = Io.e-Z, where the absorption coefficient is determined by the intensity and wavelength of the radiation
and the surface medium with which it is interacting. Let us assume that a laser beam is scanned in a straight
line with constant velocity. Where the x-y plane relates to the surface of a liquid and the z-axis relates to the
penetration through the liquid. Irradiance at any point within the resin can be calculated as a factor of the
irradiance incident on the surface of the resin, H (x, y, 0). For an ideal Gaussian laser beam:

   Wo relates to 1/e2 Gaussian half-width, which is ~ 13.5% of peak H. When considering that irradiance, H,
is termed the `radiant power per unit area,' it can be seen that exposure, E, is a function and as it is termed,
`energy per unit area,' which is the integral of irradiance with respect to time. Thus,
                                                        STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH] | 593

   Where, E (y, z) = exposure (Jm-2), PL = laser power (W), Vs = laser velocity (ms-1), Dp = penetration depth
(m), and Wo = 1/e2 Gaussian half-width (m).

   In the case of laser interaction with photopolymers there is a critical value of exposure, Ec. Any value below
this and the polymer will remain liquid, any value above this and the polymer will solidify. The transition point
between the two states is termed as the gel point where the polymer changes viscosity. It follows that as the
laser energy penetrates the resin at some point there will only be enough energy to raise the resin to the `gel
point,' i.e., energy absorption by the resin, and at this distance there will be a solidification boundary.

   In order that the shape of a curing line is determined, Eq. 15-2 can be used with values set at the gel point.
The result is a parabolic cylinder. This effectively produces a single cured line in the direction of travel. The
maximum exposure will be at y = 0, so the maximum depth of the curing process can be determined. This is
done by first determining what the maximum exposure is at the centre of the incident beam,

   The maximum cure depth Cd can now be determined at Zmax:

   Cd represents a fundamental side of SLA and provides essential information that can be used to control
the laser and determine what effects occur within the resin. As the parabolic cure pattern was determined, the
maximum cured line width can also be determined because it will occur on the surface, i.e., z=0. The cured line
width, Lw:
594 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

   This is another important result, namely that the cured line width is directly proportional to the laser spot
diameter. When cure depth is increased the cured line width increases by the square root of the cured depth:

   Substituting for Emax and solving for Vs:

   Laser scan velocity is inversely proportional to laser spot size and decreases exponentially with an increase in
the ratio of cure depth/penetration depth (Cd/Dp), i.e., increased cure depths draw more slowly than shallow
cure depths. Accuracy is heavily dependent on the thickness of the layers that are used to construct the model.
The layer thickness is a user definable parameter and as such can affect build quality. Layers will also affect
the quality of the curved surfaces and leads to a phenomenon called stair stepping. Stair stepping affects build
time, accuracy, and cost. Stair stepping phenomena affect all AM processes. Part orientation can reduce stair
stepping effects and is essential to maximize part accuracy. Here are some common guidelines: define the most
important surfaces, orientate part for best build, use adaptive slicing procedures for maximum resolution and
position surface with respect to steps for ease of finishing. Support structures are necessary to maintain part
integrity while it is being constructed: (1) supporting `island' structures - it is extremely important that each
                                                        STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH] | 595

layer has a layer of some form underneath to attach itself to. With complex geometry this is often not the case
and supports are therefore needed to ensure the cured resin does not float away; (2) support to reduce part
distortion where solidification takes place there is likely to be an amount of distortion. This can be constrained
by placing support structures that maintain tension during contraction. The result is stress concentrations, but
the part will be geometrically superior.

   In order that SLA parts to be built to the highest degree of accuracy there must be some form of calibration
of the mechanisms within the machine. For example, over time the diameter of the beam will change as the
cavity ages. Optical alignment may shift due to small temperature variations. Mode structure may alter due
to internal misalignments from small vibrations and the laser power reading of the SLA may drift from the
calibrated value. Practical studies into this problem have shown interesting results. Studies into accuracy show
that the major sources of inaccuracy are shrinkage and laser linewidth, both of which can be compensated for
by the equipment user and the hatch pattern.

   The limiting factor that controls the speed of the SLA process is the re-coating time. Free liquid surfaces
are very problematic, they must be given settling time after a disturbance such as dipping. Meniscus effects
will distort the liquid level around surface features of the model. Hence, a doctor blade is used to level the
resin after each layer and before each slice exposure is commenced. The problems are compounded by fluid
dynamics of the sweeping motion. The blade is competing with surface tension forces acting on both the blade
and part within the vat. There are additional affects which produce a build-up of resin ahead the of the blade
which then provides a pressure gradient that drives resin underneath the blade as it sweeps across and affects the
thickness of the resin coating behind the blade. The effects are a function of the resin temperature, viscosity,
doctor blade geometry and velocity (Figure 15-12).

   Figure 15-13 shows the workings of the Zephyr re-coating system that is now provided for most 3D SLA
systems as an upgrade option. The blade deposits a curtain of resin directly onto the new surface thereby
minimizing the time for re-coating and the effects of dragging and displacing the resin through sweeping.

   In order to prepare the new layer for curing, issues must be addressed: the resin surface must be maintained
at the focal plane of the imaging system; the surface must be uniformly flat, level, and free of extraneous
features; the surface must be a controlled distance above the previous layer; and control systems are essential!
   The resin surface position must be known. Light-bounce techniques are employed to locate surface, Diode
Laser Levelling System (DLL). Layer thickness is usually around of 100-200 sq. m. Surface positioning
typically requires positional control of 3-7% of the layer thickness, about 7.5mm. Location can be determined
allowing feedback to the liquid control system and speeds are increased (Figure 15-14). Laser spot size
influences the irradiance (energy distribution), which in turn will affect depth of cure, width of the cured line,
and the extent of overcure. We must therefore keep the illumination conditions constant across the whole area
of the vat. An alternative is a flat-field focusing lens that maintains the focal properties across the vat and forces
the beam to interact with the resin at near normal incidence (Figure 15-15). This system is commonly used in
laser marking systems. The way in which the object is cured within its layer boundary determines the level of
internal stress and shrinkage factors. Part accuracy can be improved by careful choice of hatch pattern as there
are many to choose from. Hatch patterns determine part accuracy, hatching is used to photo cure the liquid
in the interior regions of the part. Hatch pattern determines the amount of curing within an object which
therefore affects its physical properties and internal stresses and many patterns have been developed Tri-hatch
uses a scanned line parallel to the x-axis combined with lines at 60 and 120 degrees to the x-axis.

   There is approximately 50% uncured resin within the triangular matrix, which is cured in post processing
generating high distortion. The Weave adopts two orthogonal vector sweeps per layer. The amount of
uncured resin is reduced, part accuracy is increased along with build speed. Errors on the corners are often
observed. STAR-Weave is a staggered hatch pattern, alternative sequencing, and retracted hatch offsets every
other layer of the x- and y-hatch vectors. It prevents x-and y-hatch overlay and reduces stress build up. A
retracted hatch keeps endpoints from bonding with the border.

   The following advantages are associated with SLA:

· It can use several types of resin with varying properties apart from the resins from Ciba-Geigy.
· It has good surface finish and accuracy.
· It has a good speed depending on model types.
· The SLA does not require any attendant when it is in operation, it can be left to run on its own.
· Parts can have both internal and external contours and shapes.
· The SLA can build multiple parts at once.
· The SLA can be used to produce complex geometry. SLA produced parts can be used to create patterns

   for soft tooling, with part design duplicated in a polyurethane material that more closely approximated
   the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material from which the actual part would later be made. It
   can also be used for mold making for casting operation.
· Parts produced by SLA are used for flow test visualization; and
· Parts produced by SLA are used as investment casting patterns.

Despite all the accompanying advantages, the SLA has some disadvantages:

· Shrinkage and distortions are present in the material. This leads to layers separating from the structure.
· The surface finish depends on the slice thickness and material. Also, the accuracy greatly depends on the

   parts complexity.
· It needs a lot of finishing operations that can be tedious and messy. This will lead to the purchase of

   finishing apparatus that is an added cost. Post cure is required for all the resin-based processes either
   acrylic or epoxy resin.
· Large and thin flat structures are most difficult to produce and hold within tolerance. The Engineers
   compensate for these effects by altering the part's orientation or by adding the proper type of fixing to
   hold the features in position during the post-curing process, a lot of the stresses that cause the part to
   wrap are basically molded in, so when the supports are removed, there is a good chance that the wall is
   going to warp.
· Surface finish and tolerance are not complementary. Orienting a part one way may result in higher
600 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

      accuracy and a less attractive surface finish. Conversely, orienting the part another way may lead to a
      smoother finish with less precise tolerances.
  · The use of expendable patterns generated with the aid of SLA is not without problems. Because of the
      high thermal expansion characteristics of the polymers used in SLA, use of patterns created with the
      process can result in mold cracking or breaking during burn-out.
  · For each part, a support structure must be modeled and designed in the CAD system; and
  · Unlike other systems, Process does not produce very fine tolerances. Hence tolerance of ±0.0013 mm is
      not possible for now with SLA, which is ±0.2 mm in x-y plane.

A clear advantage of using SLA in space is its ability to convert liquids into solids and the solids to be used
for feedstocks/fillers for other AM processes such as FDM. The use of lasers to fuse materials can be extended
to metals making selective laser sintering (SLS) a technique that will be of great use in the space environment
especially for the creation of very high strength alloys and alloys that cannot be manufactured on Earth.

FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) processes uses thermoplastic wire-like filaments that are melted in the
deposition head. The material is then extruded from the head and deposited on a layer-by-layer basis. The
layering lamination technique is based upon the rapid solidification (~ 1/10 second) of the molten laminate
material from the Modeling filament. The semi-liquid thermoplastic material is deposited onto thin layers,
building the model upwards off a fixture base. The plastic or wax material solidifies in place positioned by the
x-y controlled extrusion head. A precision volumetric pump is used to control the material passing through
the extrusion orifice. The extrusion process shears the material, and it quickly solidifies while bonding to the
previous layer by heating it and then fusing. The model is fabricated upon a piston, which is lowered between
layers to make room for the next layer. This process is repeated until the part is fully built.

   A series of cassettes or spools supplies the system with a polyester compound. Each cassette holds 50
rectangular wafers. A stapling mechanism feeds the wafers into a pressurized heated channel that supplies the
material to a viscosity pump. To ensure accuracy, the material is extruded through a 150-300 mm diameter
orifice at a controlled rate. Parts are built on a thermally controlled metallic substrate that rests on a table. As
each layer is extruded, it bonds to the previous layer and solidifies. The pump head, table and gantry move in
the x, y, and z axes, respectively.

   Supports for the parts are built from the same polyester material, using a support-generation algorithm.
The system creates perforations where supports adjoin the model, making it easy to snap off any required
supports. Printed models often require fewer supports than other systems' models due to precise pump
control. A technique called "bridging" allows the material to be extruded across a distance without supports.
Thin perimeter walls are created, and the pump head fills in the area, creating a flat surface between the walls.
This technique speeds build time and maintains a good surface finish. No special clean-up is required.
                                                        STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH] | 601

   Modeling filaments include ABS, medical grade ABS, (ABS prototypes have 85% of the strength of an actual
molded part), investment casting wax, thermoplastic elastomers, and many other materials. Models can be
marked, sanded, painted, or drilled. Accuracy of the models can be produced within ±0.127 mm (±.005 in).
Layer Width / Thickness: Operator may optionally select road widths between 0.254 to 2.54 mm (0.010 to
0.100 in) and thickness from 0.05 to 0.762 mm (0.002 to 0.030 in). The advantages of FDM include:

  · All the materials that are used for this process are non-toxic, hence it is safe for office use.
  · It is a high-speed process. Layers are laid at speeds up to 23 m/min.
  · The parts do not require support structure while building. There is no material wastage or cleaning.

      However, 3D Modeler creates a support in mid-air rather than building the support up from the base as
      in other applications.
  · It is excellent for making investment-casting pattern using wax. Parts produced by FDM processes
      emerge fully cured so that they can be used immediately or can be treated after grinding, painting, etc.
  · It uses varieties of heat-fusible thermoplastic filament materials and wax filaments. For example,
      machinable wax, ABS like plastics, investment casting wax and nylon.
  · The system is also capable of extruding plastic into free space depending on the part geometry; and
  · It is a desktop system that can operate in an office environment without any special ancillary service.

The disadvantages include:

  · The following disadvantages are peculiar to the FDM process.
  · Part strength is limited to adhesion/fusion between filaments.
  · It requires support structure for some parts.
  · There is the problem of delaminating of parts due to poor bonding between layers; and
  · The operating temperature of between 82 and 105 oC makes it suitable for office use and puts a natural

      limit on the useful in-service temperature range of parts.

The method of manufacturing objects as a series of horizontal layers poses a unique set of problems,
irrespective of the techniques involved in the fabrication of each layer. This section is intended to provide
the reader with some insight into the considerations that must be made when building parts by layered
manufacturing techniques.

STAIR-STEPPING PHENOMENON

The slicing process described earlier produces a set of horizontal cross sections, each of these sections conforms
to the geometry of the original CAD model to a degree of accuracy, which is significant to the entire process.
However, each layer is of continuous cross section through its thickness (i.e., in the Z-direction), and therefore
602 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

parts cannot accurately conform to the CAD geometry in the vertical plane. This is best illustrated by
considering the situation shown in Figure 15-16. A cylinder has been built with its circular cross section
parallel to the slice axis, i.e., perpendicular to the layers. If any single part layer is considered, slicing software
has produced a layer, the top surface of which conforms precisely to the CAD geometry. However, because
the layer is rectangular in cross section it cannot conform to the curved surface across its entire thickness, the
largest deviation at its bottom surface. This results in the stepped effect shown which has been termed the
stair-stepping phenomenon.

                                     Figure 15-16: Stair-stepping Phenomenon
                STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH] | 603

LAYER THICKNESS

It is clear from the example shown in Figure 15-16 (a) that the smaller the slice thickness, the greater the
resolution of the final part (as shown by cylinders (i) to (iii)). It may seem sensible to use the smallest possible
layer thickness that can be physically created by the system, but the smaller the layer thickness, the more slices
are required resulting in longer data processing time, larger data files and a longer build time. To optimize
the process, variable layer thickness may be used over different ranges of the part. The example of the funnel
shown in Figure 15-16 (b) has a fine layer thickness where the surfaces are sloped, and stair-stepping is more
pronounced, and thicker layers on the vertically sided sections.

EFFECTS OF CAD GEOMETRY

In the two examples provided so far it is the top surface of each layer that conforms to the CAD geometry, and
this is the case in many of the commercially available systems. The reason for this can be seen if we consider
the SLA process in which a laser beam is guided across the surface of a vat of liquid polymer, tracing out the
geometry of each layer, and whenever the laser strikes the resin surface, a small volume is cured and solidified
to a depth dependent on laser power and scan speed. The top surface of the layer must conform to the CAD
geometry because that is what is drawn on the resin surface, with a continuous depth cured below it provides
the layer thickness.

   Figure 15-16 (c) shows three different ways in which the layers might conform to the CAD geometry, in each
case the shaded areas represent the deviation from the true geometry. Example (i) shows the case where the top
of each section conforms to the required layer outline, and example (ii) shows the opposite case in which layers
are formed from the bottom up. It is clear from these examples that extent of deviation will be dependent of
the gradient of the sloping surface, and whether the error is positive or negative will depend on the direction of
slope. In many cases the most favorable situation would be where all deviation was positive and excess material
could then be carefully removed to leave the accurate part. However, the additional processing power required
to produce the necessary data corrections ensures that only positive deviations may prove prohibitive over the
layers. The situation shown in example (iii) represents the intermediate case where the center of each layer
conforms to the CAD geometry, resulting in smaller deviation in both directions. This would produce the
most accurate parts in terms of maximum deviation, but again a large amount of additional processing power
would be required.
604 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

PART ORIENTATION

The manual finishing of parts built by layered manufacturing to remove the stair-stepping effect is the most
labor-intensive phase of the process, and great skill is required if dimensional accuracy is to be maintained. The
only part surfaces that will not exhibit stepping are those built parallel to the slice plane, and therefore parts
should be oriented so that cosmetically important faces are built in this direction and important dimensions
are built parallel to the slice axis. Figure 15-16 (d) shows how a simple 45O rotation improves the surface finish
of faces A and B, and maintains the accuracy of dimension. However, this may have a detrimental effect on
other features of the part and so a suitable balance must be found. This analysis assumes that the `as built'
geometry is more accurate than the hand finished geometry, but this depends on the skill of the model maker
and the accuracy of the process.

   The build time involved in the fabrication of any part is principally dependent on the number of layers
involved, and may therefore be minimized through careful selection of the part orientation. However, it is not
simply a matter of choosing the orientation with the smaller z-height because all the other effects discussed
must also be considered, and a compromise must be made. In many layered manufacturing systems, the degree
of part distortion occurring as a result of the layer generation process is department on the orientation of the
part with respect to the slice axis. Therefore, another consideration is introduced in selecting the most suitable
build orientation.

SUPPORT STRUCTURES

In any manufacturing technique the workpiece must be mounted or supported in some way in preparation for
processing, for example held in the vice of a machine tool or the chuck of a lathe. AM processes also require
to be mounted to hold it in position, and further structures are often required to support unstable geometry
as they are built. The principal benefits achieved by these systems stem from the fact that the processes are
fully automated, and that part specific fixtures or tooling are not required, and therefore it is not possible
to manually position prefabricated fixtures and still reap the same benefits. However, the fact that rapid
prototyping systems fabricate whatever is described by the CAD input means that they can build any support
structures in the way that they build the parts, thereby maintaining their flexibility and automated nature.

   Initially, support structures were designed on the CAD systems in conjunction with the part, but this
was labor intensive, and the operator was required to have a full understanding of the part building process.
Software packages have been developed which generate the design of any required supports automatically by
inspecting the part geometry and assessing what is required. The support designs are then sliced in the way as
the part and incorporated into the build information sent to the fabricator. The supports are fabricated in the
same way as the part and are incorporated into it, but are normally in the form of grids of very thin webs that
may easily be removed once the part is complete.

   Support structures perform the following important functions:
                                                        STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH] | 605

   Act as a mounting device holding the part in position as it is built.
   This is particularly important in those techniques that form parts from a vat of liquid resin (e.g.,
stereolithography) where the bottom layer must be firmly attached to the build platform to stop the part
floating away.
   Act as a constraint reducing part distortion
   In many rapid prototyping processes, the procedures involved in creating individual layers from their raw
materials involves either a total phase change (e.g., liquid resin cured to solid resin) or localized heating and
cooling cycles (e.g., selective sintering of powdered materials). In either case the degree of material shrinkage
causes some part distortion. Supports may be used to constrain these distortions to some extent thereby
improving part accuracy. Part distortion can also occur due to faulty STL files. Missing points, missing facets
or just poor data manipulation algorithms may cause distortion in the final object. However, with the right
procedures in place, the problems associated with the building process can be minimized.

SPACE STRUCTURES AND SPACE COMPLEXES

The exploration of space for manufacturing purposes is enabled by systems and complexes that provide
physical infrastructure, technologies, and operations required for space exploration. The complexes play a
crucial role in enabling manufacturing processes and systems to operate beyond the confines of Earth to
manufacture products in space using the advantages provided by an environment that promulgates
innovations in products and processes.

   Space systems refers to hardware, software, and communications designed to operate in the space
environment. Space systems are needed for scientific research, satellite deployments, interplanetary missions,
and space exploration. Satellites form a fundamental part of space systems and monitor weather,
communications, etc., (Figure 15-17). Orbiting spacecraft provide data for weather forecasting,
communications, and monitoring the Earth environment. Advanced propulsion systems, navigation, and
communication protocols are integrated into space systems to ensure the successful and efficient process of
manufacturing in space.

   Space complexes, known as spaceports or launch facilities, serve as the gateways to space and the
manufacturing environment. These facilities include launch pads, control centers, and assembly buildings.
They provide the infrastructure and resources to prepare, test, and launch spacecraft. Space complexes, such
as Kennedy Space Center in Florida (Figure 15-18), Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, and the European
Spaceport in French Guiana, are space complexes that coalesce scientists, engineers, and technicians from
different countries to work towards refining the processes associated with space manufacturing. Space
complexes are not only vital for government space agencies such as NASA, Roscosmos and ESA, but also for
private space companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, companies that are pioneering space
travel that creates opportunities to manufacture in space products that cannot be made on Earth such as
immiscible alloys, high purity pharmaceuticals and defect free semiconductors.

   The preparation of materials on Earth using simulated conditions of space have been developed based on
weightlessness and numerical models of material behavior using facilities on Earth. Ground facilities include
drop towers, buoyancy pools, air-borne laboratories, and balloons. Space complexes on Earth includes short
span microgravity experiments up to 10 minutes, but the real measure of the ability to manufacture in space is
due to experiments conducted on space complexes.
   The International Space Station (ISS) is a space complex (Figure 15-19) that serves as a manufacturing
laboratory. Here, highly specialized materials have been created for the purpose of manufacturing products
and secondary work has been done to understand the conditions of manufacturing in space, i.e., heat and mass
transfers and solidification processes that involve the formation of dendrites and grains.
   Space systems and space complexes are set to increase the significance of the development of manufacturing
processes that take advantage of zero gravity conditions in a vacuum with the elimination of convection
currents. Exploration projects, such as NASA's Artemis, aim to return to the Moon to prepare for missions to
608 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

Mars. This will require the development of advanced launch systems, habitats, manufacturing processes and
systems and life support systems.

statement-on-russian-asat-test).

   The emergence of private companies such as Space Forge has added a new dimension to space
manufacturing. With the advent of reusable rockets and satellites, space complexes are witnessing a surge
in activity that is driving innovation, making space more accessible, and pushing the boundaries of what is
possible in space manufacturing (Weinzierl and Acocella, 2016). The conditions required to produce high
performance materials include understanding gaseous and liquid phase processing of feedstocks, converting
to a liquid phase followed by solidification and casting. These are energy intensive processes and so the space
complex must be designed to provide the required energy needed to manufacture products in space. Early
studies of manufacturing in space relied on space complexes operating in a weightless environment, with
a limited size and power limitations. Therefore, the design of space systems and complexes specifically for
manufacturing need to be developed to advance space exploration where items are made rather than taken
from Earth.

ECONOMY-ORIENTED SPACE MISSIONS AND STRATEGIES

Economy-oriented space missions and strategies refer to initiatives and approaches that focus on using space
resources and activities to stimulate economic growth and development. Economy-oriented space missions and
strategies include:

   Space Manufacturing: Using the conditions of space, such as microgravity and vacuum, so that private
enterprises can manufacture products that cannot be made on Earth, such as pharmaceuticals, materials,
advanced semiconductors, and the production of advanced nanotechnologies. Commercializing these
activities can lead to economic benefits and technological advancements (Weinzierl and Sarang 2021, Weinzierl
et alia 2021).

   Resource Extraction: There are various resources in space that can be mined, including rare metals, water,
and oxygen. Developing technologies and strategies for extracting and using these resources will lead to a new
space-based economy (Weinzierl and Acocella 2017, Weinzierl and Haddaji, 2019, Weinzierl et alia 2021).

   Space-based Energy: Capturing solar energy in space using large-scale solar arrays, suing it for manufacturing
purposes in space or transmitting it back to Earth wirelessly is a goal that is highly desirable. Space-based energy
systems could provide a virtually unlimited and clean energy source, revolutionizing the energy sector and
creating new economic opportunities for manufacturing industries.

   Space Debris Cleanup: As space debris poses a growing threat to satellites and space missions, there is a
need for technologies and missions aimed at removing or mitigating debris. Developing cost-effective cleanup
strategies could not only improve space operations but also create a feedstock for circular manufacturing
systems in space (Weinzierl et alia 2016).

   Space Tourism and related development of consumer goods: The rise of space tourism presents significant
commercial opportunities. It could create demand for consumer goods and products specifically designed
for the space environment. This could range from clothing and food to entertainment and personal care
products. Manufacturing these goods in space could cater to the emerging space tourism market and create
new economic opportunities. Further, space manufacturing can contribute to the development of space
tourism infrastructure, including the production of spacecraft, habitats, and life support systems specifically
designed for space tourists (https://hbr.org/2021/02/the-commercial-space-age-is-here).

   These are just a few examples of economy-oriented space missions and strategies. As technologies advances
and space exploration continues, new opportunities will emerge, enabling the development of a strong space
economy.
610 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF SPACE-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND MISSIONS

Economic feasibility largely depends on technological and infrastructure readiness, regulatory framework, and
market dynamics.

   Technological and infrastructure readiness is a required condition for commercialization of space which
includes activities such as low-cost, frequent launch capabilities; in-space manufacturing; scalable habitats; in-
space resource extraction and energy collection; and reliable radiation shielding and debris mitigation. This
is evidenced related to space transportation with the public-private partnership called Commercial Orbital
Transportation Services (COTS) developed by NASA in 2005. COTS allowed NASA to adopt a more targeted
role focused on space exploration and basic science, leaving economic development of space largely to the
private sector. It also made NASA a customer and partner of its private contractors. Thus, this public-private
partnership approach allowed for a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle of development that could support the
space economy. As an example, Weinzierl (2018) explains cheaper and more frequent rocket launches might
facilitate short-term tourism, along with industrial and scientific experimentation on suborbital and orbiting
spacecraft. Routine activities could lead to demand for commercial habitats and longer flights, leading to
increased demand for resources in space and opportunities for complementary activities.

   Space missions are often funded by governments through space agencies like NASA (United States), ESA
(European Space Agency), Roscosmos (Russia), and others. These agencies allocate budgets for research,
development, and space exploration. Government funding is driven by various factors, including national
interests, scientific objectives, defense considerations, and international collaborations. Regulatory framework
could encompass multiple dimensions, from property rights considerations to distributional concerns, and
mitigating negative externalities that can arise due to space-related activities. The space debris problem hints
at the tragedy of commons scenario and threatens to become unmanageable if regulatory oversights are not
exercised. It is a classic example of negative externalities, and conventional remedies suggested by economic
theory such as standard Pigouvian price on debris fails in this case since there is no established space taxing
authority (Hansen 2016). Lack of delineated property rights additionally make it harder to quantify and
internalize externalities related to space debris. With respect to regulatory purview, a concerted effort to enact
international treaties and agreements would be instrumental in resolving many potential challenges associated
with space activities currently and in the future. Some policy questions that need to be considered when
developing a commercial space sector in a country include government's role in coordinating and subsidizing
interdependent technologies, nature of subsidies to implement such as cost-sharing, revenue guarantees,
incentives etc. (Weinzierl 2018).

   Market dynamics considerations play out when a centralized model is transformed to a decentralized one.
Typically, public goods provisions are guaranteed in a centralized model and typically left underprovided if
left to the market. High demand and cost conditions in a sector can be instrumental in paving the way for
a decentralized model. For example, the COTS program allowed NASA to leverage private capital to acquire
required services cheaply. Apart from subsidizing commercial launch vehicles, a competitive market structure
                                                         STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH] | 611

was developed due to a diversified set of award contracts. Additionally, decentralization also spurred activities
and innovations, broadening the space economy. Market structures and functioning depend on analyzing
demand conditions and associated costs:

 1. a) Market demand and revenue generation opportunities for space-manufactured products need an
      assessment of the market potential, competitive landscape, pricing strategies, and potential partnerships
      or customers. Some factors beyond the conventional needs such as space manufacturing, resource
      extraction etc. that can stimulate demand for space activities are potential for spin-off technologies that
      have applications beyond space exploration. Many everyday technologies and innovations have been
      derived from space-related research and development, including satellite communication, miniaturized
      electronics, improved materials, and medical advancements. These spin-off technologies can have
      significant economic impacts across various industries. New markets and industries can also develop
      which could include space-based construction, manufacturing facilities in space, space-based agriculture,
      and manufacturing goods specifically tailored for space habitats or off-world settlements. These new
      markets can foster economic growth and provide novel business opportunities.

 2. b) Various factors that need to be considered when analyzing costs towards space activities such as in-
      space manufacturing and space missions include:

  · Cost of Development: The development and construction of space missions includes costs associated
      with research and development, design, engineering, manufacturing, and testing spacecraft, launch
      vehicles, ground infrastructure, and other necessary equipment.

  · Launch Costs: Some of the expenses could include launching manufacturing equipment, raw materials,
      and supplies from Earth to space, payloads into space using rockets or other launch vehicles. The
      development of reusable rockets and in-space refueling infrastructure could potentially reduce these
      launch costs.

  · Operations and Maintenance Costs: Space missions would include costs associated with tracking and
      communication systems, data analysis, mission control operations, ground support, and maintaining the
      health and functionality of the spacecraft. In-space manufacturing costs would include the costs of
      personnel, power supply, monitoring and control systems, waste management, and regular maintenance
      and repairs of the manufacturing equipment and facilities.

  · Resource Acquisition Costs: In-space manufacturing often relies on utilizing local resources, such as
      asteroid mining or lunar resource extraction. Evaluating the expenses associated with identifying,
      extracting, and processing these resources, development of resource prospecting technologies, mining
      techniques and refining processes would be required.

  · Labor Costs: Assessing labor costs is essential when considering human involvement in in-space
      manufacturing operations and space missions. Costs include training and supporting astronauts or
      space workers, as well as potential automation and robotic systems that could reduce labor requirements
612 | STRATEGY AND ECONOMICS OF SPACE MISSIONS [JACKSON & JOSEPH]

      and associated expenses.
  · Cost Reduction Strategies: International collaborations and public-private partnerships can help

      distribute costs and share resources. Launch costs can be reduced by utilizing local resources, avoiding
      transportation expenses, and minimizing reliance on Earth-based supply chains. Other strategies include
      reusable rockets, 3D printing of spacecraft components, miniaturization of satellites, and increased
      automation in manufacturing and operations. Instead of relying on Earth-based supply chains and
      waiting for resupply missions, astronauts or automated systems could produce and repair parts, tools, or
      equipment as needed, leading to on-demand manufacturing and repair capabilities. This reduces the
      need for stockpiling and improves mission sustainability.
  · Scale and Efficiency: Economies of scale can be realized when average costs fall by increasing production.
      The company Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) demonstrates both economies of scale and
      efficiency characterized by reusability, reusability without over-engineering, and vertical integration.
      Even though reusability imposes new costs such as research and development to establish vertical
      landing capabilities, operating expenses to recover spacecraft and fairings, and refurbishment efforts
      between launches; enough demand and low average costs were instrumental for its successes. SpaceX
      sought to take advantage of a virtuous cycle in which growth led to cost reductions and, thus, more
      growth through lower prices (Weinzierl et al. 2021). Cost efficiency was realized by focusing on
      reliability without over-engineering and vertical integration. SpaceX used off-the-shelf components, and
      previously used, proven technologies wherever possible rather than developing new, custom-built
      technology. Highly vertically integrated structures allowed them to eliminate transaction costs
      throughout the supply chain.

CONCLUSIONS

The developments of manufacturing in space are wide and include planetary mining and manufacturing on
planet, asteroid mining and manufacturing, and manufacturing in orbit. The challenges to integrate systems
to minimize waste and effort are significant. The space environment develops materials that cannot be made
on Earth owing to differences in gravity or environmental factors. The scientists of the future will need
to design and build systems and complexes to support the economy-oriented approach to manufacturing
products in space and the complexities associated with costs associated with this activity need to be fully
understood and their effects quantified.

THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE
WARFARE [DREW]

OBJECTIVES

  · Students shall comprehend the foundational differences between quantum technology and legacy
      computing, communication, encryption, and measurement technologies.

  · Students shall assess the capabilities and limitations of quantum computing, communication,
      encryption, and measurement to the field of space operations.

INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to quantum technologies, including quantum computing,
quantum communications, quantum encryption, and quantum sensing. We will explore the physical
principles behind the quantum technologies and the potential applications of these quantum technologies
to space operations. Because quantum technologies and the quantum mechanics behind them are highly
technical disciplines, this chapter does not endeavor to explain them in any level of technical detail. Rather, it
provides a basic overview of some of the fundamental ideas behind quantum technologies in order to allow
the reader an appreciation for what is currently happening in space with regard to these fields and what could
realistically happen in the future. Thus, the reader should leave with an appreciation of the state of the art of
quantum technologies as they apply to space operations.

   The state of the art is evolving rapidly, and space-related applications of quantum technologies still depend
on government funding. As a result, these programs are subject to budgetary, developmental timelines, and
flight scheduling considerations. The nature of fundamental science development became apparent to me
when, as a junior space operations officer, I visited the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University
in the autumn of 2011. They were, at the time, experimenting with quantum computing, and I asked our
guide when he thought they would have an operational quantum computer. Our guide was prepared for the
question and responded that he thought the technology would be operational in about twenty years.

   While the guide and I did not agree on a definition of "operational," now past the halfway point of
that twenty-year period, it looks like my guide had estimated conservatively. Quantum technologies continue
620 | THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW]

to evolve rapidly, and the applications of those technologies promise revolutions in complex computation,
cryptography, and precision measurement. Think-tanks, consulting firms, defense organizations, industry, and
academia are awash with studies on these subjects, and there is a justified concern that existing systems and
methods are vulnerable--or will be vulnerable in the near term--to attacks by actors with advanced quantum
technologies. More private capital investment is on the horizon. For quantum computing specifically, the
industry is expected to grow from "$412 million in 2020 to $8.6 billion in 2027" (Campbell, 2023). Among
nations and corporations, there is an obvious desire to master these technologies as quickly as possible because
doing so provides first-mover advantages in science, defense, and business.

   But just what are these quantum technologies and what makes them different from legacy digital methods?
Furthermore, what are the implications of these technologies for space operations? As stated, the aim of this
chapter is not to make the reader an expert on quantum mechanics or space operations but to provide a basic
understanding of how quantum computing, quantum communications, quantum encryption, and quantum
measurement work and how those technologies are already affecting or will affect space operations.

   To that end, it may be valuable to address some limitations about quantum technologies up front. First,
in most cases, quantum technologies are more likely to augment rather than supplant classical computing,
communication, encryption, and measurement methods; we will still need traditional methods for the
foreseeable future. Second, digital computers, the networks that connect them, and their data are not helpless
against quantum intrusion. Quantum intrusions can be defended against, as we will see in the discussion
on post-quantum cryptography (Bernhardt, 2019). Third, quantum technologies are not always the most
practical option; searching large amounts of data, for example, may be best accomplished by either classical
or quantum methods, depending on the conditions (Bernhardt, 2019). Like any other tool, both digital tools
and quantum tools must be applied in the ways that are best suited to their strengths while minimizing their
vulnerabilities. In other words, it is important to assess the capabilities and limitations of these technologies
objectively, recognizing that they are neither a panacea for all our problems, nor are they harbingers of certain
doom.

   To begin considering the strengths and vulnerabilities of these tools, it is necessary to understand some
fundamentals about digital and quantum technologies, and while this discussion begins with a focus on
quantum computing, the ideas apply across quantum applications. The primary difference between digital and
quantum technologies lies in what physical phenomenon are used to convey information. Digital computers
encode information in a binary system that uses the presence or absence of an electrical signal to represent ones
and zeros. If an electrical signal is present, the value of the bit is one; if there is no electrical signal, the value of
the bit is zero. Different combinations of ones and zeros correspond to different symbolic values. For example,
the numbers zero through five can be represented by the strings of ones and zeros as shown in Table 16-1 below.

                Table 16-1: Representation of numbers zero through five as binary numbers.

   Whereas traditional computing uses electrical signals to generate ones and zeros, quantum computers use
the physical properties of elementary particles: electrons or photons (Bernhardt, 2019). For electrons, the
physical property is called spin. Like the Earth or a dipole magnet, electrons have a north and a south pole,
and spin is a measurement of how far the electron's polar axis is tilted from the vertical (Bernhardt, 2019). For
photons, the measured property is polarization; the angle of a polarized light particle (a quanta) as it passes
through a filter is measured (Bernhardt, 2019). While both particles are available for quantum technologies,
it is important to note that the ongoing investigations related to space operations discussed in this chapter
primarily employ photons.

   Whether measuring electrons or photons, the way in which the measurements occur influences the outcome
of the measurement and must be accounted for (Bernhardt, 2019). Furthermore, the outcomes of the
measurements can only be assessed probabilistically (rather than with certainty as in the case of measuring
whether an electrical switch is deterministically either on or off). This information is encapsulated in a
quantum bit, or qubit, which then may be translated into a string of traditional bits (Van Amerongen, 2021).
Traditional computing and quantum computing, therefore, are complementary technologies but before
delving into the topic of quantum computing specifically, it is necessary to discuss the unusual properties of
quantum particles.

UNUSUAL QUANTUM PROPERTIES

Electrons and photons behave in non-intuitive ways. The below figure describes these properties:
superposition, entanglement, and observation. Each of these properties creates challenges and opportunities
for how quantum systems may be used. First, to put it in terms of a classical computing analog, superposition
means that a qubit can be both a one and a zero at the same time (Van Amerongen, 2021). The challenge is that
622 | THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW]

this physical state requires extremely low temperatures, only about 15 millikelvins above absolute zero (Van
Amerongen, 2021). The opportunity is that superposition potentially enables quantum computers to perform
multiple calculations simultaneously, allowing them to solve problems so complex that they are beyond the
capacity of even the most powerful supercomputers (Van Amerongen, 2021).

                 Figure 16-1: Definitions of Superposition, Entanglement, and Observation

   Source: (Buchholz & Mariani, 2020)
   Entanglement means that when one particle is entangled with one or more other particles, what happens to
one particle--a change in spin, for example--will simultaneously affect the other particle, even when separated
by vast distances without any apparent physical way of exchanging information--what Albert Einstein
famously called "spooky action at a distance" (Simonite & Chen, 2023). Being able to "produce and detect
pairs of entangled photons" is essential for transmission of information among quantum computers and
other relay nodes like satellites, but doing this, and producing the number of terminals and nodes needed
for a quantum internet involves a series of complicated scientific and engineering tasks that are only now
becoming feasible (O'Neill, "Space station to host `self-healing' quantum communications tech demo." NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. , 2022); (Buchholz & Mariani, 2020)
   Finally, once entangled particles are observed, they cannot be read again. The act of observing them changes
their natures, which "can be a great advantage for secure communications" but also makes copying computer
code impossible in the classical way and testing programs exceedingly difficult (Buchholz & Mariani, 2020).
Furthermore, because photons and electrons exist everywhere in nature, entangled particles are subject to
                                                                                  THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW] | 623

interference from the natural environment, limiting the distances over which they can be transmitted on fiber
optic networks without "trusted nodes" to function as repeater stations (Kwon, 2020).

QUANTUM COMPUTERS

In the discussion of quantum technologies, the place to begin is with a discussion of quantum computers.
As mentioned in the introduction, quantum computers have been under development for quite some time,
and their power and sophistication are increasing at significant rates. The International Business Machine
Corporation (IBM) is currently the industry leader with its Osprey chip (Campbell, 2023). Unveiled in 2022,
Osprey's capacity is 433 qubits, and IBM plans to create a 4,000-qubit chip by 2025 (Campbell, 2023). As
long as quantum computers continue to double in processing power every six months--"four times faster than
Moore's law for classical chips"--IBM's goal remains realistic (Buchholz, Mariani, & Routh, 2020). While
quantum computing is not a topic of household conversation, quantum computers have already exceeded the
capacity of traditional supercomputers.

   Figure 16-2: Because qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, they can perform multiple
                                              operations simultaneously
624 | THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW]

   Source: (Campbell, 2023)
   The point at which quantum computing power outpaces traditional computing power is called quantum
supremacy and was first demonstrated in a combined effort of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), Google, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2019 (Tavares, 2019). In this
experiment, Google's Sycamore quantum processor outlasted NASA's Electra petascale (quadrillions of
operations per second, or a thousand trillion calculations) supercomputer in a test of computing complexity
with only 53 qubits--less than an eighth of the computing power of Osprey (Tavares, 2019); (Savage, 2019).
To verify that the advanced calculations of Sycamore were correct, the team used Oak Ridge National
Laboratory's Summit supercomputer, at that time the "most powerful supercomputer in the world," to
                                                                                  THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW] | 625

check Sycamore's math--until the point where not even Summit could keep up (Tavares, 2019). Sycamore
can achieve rates of about 200,000 trillion calculations per second, or 200,000 teraflops (Remmel, 2022).
Interestingly, since the Sycamore experiments, Oak Ridge's newest supercomputer, called Frontier, was the
first to achieve exascale computing--a performance three orders of magnitude beyond petascale or more than
one million trillion operations per second (Remmel, 2022). As of April 2023, Argonne National Laboratory's
Aurora supercomputer and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's El Capitan supercomputer--both
petascale computers--have yet to be completed but may reach operational status by the end of the year (Moss,
2023); (Bartman, 2023).

   As Electra, Sycamore, Summit, and Frontier demonstrate, advances in traditional computer science are
progressing alongside advances in quantum computing, and the two efforts often go hand-in-hand. One
application of Frontier is simulating "molecular models with more atoms with greater complexity and on
longer timescales than ever before" to gain new insights into chemical theory (Remmel, 2022). One might
easily imagine that such advanced calculations will shed light on the behavior of not only atoms, but also
of electrons and photons, the very behaviors of which are necessary for quantum computing. In a practical
sense, such advanced calculations open up a host of other possibilities. It may be possible to "invent novel
fuel sources and design new climate-resilient materials;" to visualize the millions of atoms in a virus, as was
done with COVID-19 (Remmel, 2022); to enable advanced testing of the nation's nuclear stockpile without
detonation (Bartman, 2023); to optimize shipping routes or patient medical care (Campbell, 2023), or to
simulate the fluctuations of financial markets more accurately (Bova, 2021). Calculations that "involve finding
an arrangement of items that optimizes some goal" are called combinatorics and are a particular strength of
quantum computers (Bova, 2021).

   As we will see shortly, encryption is a combinatorics problem that has particular utility in space operations
applications. First, however, it is necessary to discuss how space might be involved in connecting the
information created and stored by quantum computers. Then we may discuss how this information can
be secured through quantum encryption. Finally, quantum sensors can feed into this network either using
satellites to relay their observations or as payloads on the satellites themselves.

SATELLITES: NODES ON THE NETWORK

As with the early analog-computation satellites and with the current digital-computation satellites, satellites are
nodes on a network. They must receive commands from ground stations to conduct their normal operations,
and they must pass data down to ground stations or to other satellites to provide utility. All satellites regardless
of their size or function share these characteristics, and they employ on-board computers to process
information and radio or laser transmitters and receivers to relay it.

   The way in which information is relayed between a satellite and a ground-station computer changes
significantly with the employment of quantum technology. To relay information between quantum
computers, entangled photons need to be generated and sent to two different quantum computers, each
626 | THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW]

capable of receiving and measuring the photon (O'Neill, "NASA's quantum detector achieves world-leading
milestone." NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. , 2023). Indeed, this is the way that ground-based quantum
computers relay the quantum keys necessary to decrypt and encrypt streams of information, and this is how
China's Micius satellite was able to successfully distribute quantum keys to two ground stations in 2017 and
conduct "the world's first quantum encrypted virtual teleconference between Beijing and Vienna" (Kwon,
2020).

   One limitation of Micius was the need for exceptionally low error-detection rates (Kwon, 2020). Two
separate NASA projects are working on both the transmission and the receiving technologies necessary to
enable space-based relay between quantum computers. First, the Space Entanglement and Annealing
Quantum Experiment (SEAQUE) will demonstrate the ability to produce and internally measure entangled
photon pairs on the International Space Station (O'Neill, "Space station to host `self-healing' quantum
communications tech demo." NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. , 2022). Second, the Performance-Enhanced
Array for Counting Optical Quanta (PEACOQ) has demonstrated the ability within a laboratory to detect
1.5 billion photons per second and measure "the precise time each photon hits it, within 100 trillionths of
a second" (O'Neill, "NASA's quantum detector achieves world-leading milestone." NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. , 2023).

Laboratory. , 2023)

   Detectors like PEACOQ must retain the ability to make accurate measurements over time--a task that is a
challenge in the space environment because everything in space is continuously bombarded by various forms
of radiation that can degrade sensors (O'Neill, "Space station to host `self-healing' quantum communications
tech demo." NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. , 2022). SEAQUE is demonstrating the additional technology
of an on-board laser to repair degradation to the sensor (O'Neill, "Space station to host `self-healing' quantum
communications tech demo." NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. , 2022). With these two technologies,
NASA is investing in the foundational technologies necessary to produce and measure entangled photons.
But these two experiments only provide hardware for the distant ends of the link. To connect the ends, laser
communications will be necessary.

   Satellites typically communicate with the ground by using radio frequencies, but laser communications are
becoming more common. NASA's Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration (LLCD) in 2013 and the
Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS) in 2014 demonstrated in-space data transfer, and the Optical
Communications and Sensor Demonstration (OCSD) demonstrated space-to-ground laser transmission in
2017 (Schauer, 2022). The Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD), "the agency's first
technology demonstration of a two-way relay system," launched in 2021 aboard the Defense Department's
Space Test Program Satellite-6 (Schauer, 2022). Most notably within the commercial sector, Starlink satellites
use laser crosslinks to communicate with one another, but in-space laser communication is less challenging
than trying to send lasers over vast distances through Earth's atmosphere (Rainbow, 2021).

   Laser communications promise greater data transfer rates, greater information security, less massive
hardware, and lower power inputs (Schauer, 2022). Although laser communications work without quantum
technology, optical networks are needed to transfer qubits among quantum processors, and this means using
lasers as the "highway system" for free space transmission (that is, the transmission of information without
fiber optics) (Baird, 2021). In other words, the goal of networking multiple quantum processors across the
globe, the quantum internet, will require laser communications.

ENCRYPTION

For data that needs to be secured--everything from sensitive intelligence collections to common electronic
funds transfers--encryption is essential. Encryption allows a user to receive information securely from another
user, know that it has not been altered in the transfer process, decrypt the information into a useful form, and
keep external observers from interpreting it (Bernhardt, 2019).

   One of the most common types of encryption is called Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption
(Buchholz & Mariani, 2020). To paraphrase the explanation from (Buchholz & Mariani, 2020), RSA
encryption works in this way for a bank transaction:
628 | THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW]

  · Your computer generates a key (a number called K)
  · The bank's computer generates a large number, N, with at least 300 digits, which is the multiple of two

      prime numbers, p, and q.
  · The bank's computer also generates another number, a puzzle piece that your key needs to operate, e.
  · The bank sends you N and e. Your computer performs a calculation, creating a number called "Ke mod

      N."
  · Your computer sends Ke mod N back to the bank. They already know e and N, so they can easily

      calculate your key, K, and access your data.
  · Anyone trying to steal your data would need to be able to calculate p and q, which is exceedingly difficult

      for conventional computers.

These calculations are so difficult, in fact, that a "a regular computer needs billions of years to crack RSA,
[but] a fast quantum computer would take just hours" (Campbell, 2023). At the beginning of the decade, this
achievement was thought to be possible by 2030 using a process called Shor's algorithm (Buchholz & Mariani,
2020); Bernhardt, 2019), but a team of researchers from China in 2022 claimed to have cracked RSA using
quantum methods (Campbell, 2023). Even if their claims are inflated or false, it is still currently possible to save
RSA-encrypted data until such a time that it can be easily decrypted, raising significant concerns for national
security, the financial industry, and the protection of proprietary information (Buchholz & Mariani, 2020);
(Campbell, 2023).

   Just as quantum technology can be used to decrypt information, it can also be used to encrypt information.
One method of employing quantum technology in support of data security is called Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD). In fact, it was QKD technology that allowed the Chinese and Austrians to communicate
securely via the Micius satellite in 2017 (Barnhardt, 2019), but because Micius itself "`knew' the sequences
of photons, or keys, for each location, as well as a combined key for decryption," the satellite itself was a
vulnerability (Kwon, 2020). To eliminate that risk, the next step was to employ entanglement-based quantum
key distribution, a technique that simultaneously sends "two strings of entangled photon pairs" to two
different ground stations such that the satellite itself does not have to serve as a trusted node (Kwon, 2020).

   As in the case of comparing quantum computers with traditional supercomputers, quantum encryption
and traditional encryption are best viewed as complementary technologies rather than competing ones, and
each should be employed in the manner that makes the most sense for a given application and to maximize the
strengths of one while minimizing the weaknesses of the other. Furthermore, quantum computers--although
a serious threat to traditional encryption--are unlikely to make traditional encryption obsolete. They will,
however, be much more capable of cracking traditional encryption unless preventative measures are taken to
make them quantum-resistant (Bernhardt, 2019). For the United States, the National Institute of Standards
and Technology has the responsibility to "devise postquantum security" (Campbell, 2023), but the National
Security Agency (NSA), the intelligence community entity responsibility for cryptography, has already
                                                                                  THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW] | 629

implemented "quantum-resistant algorithms" on "existing platforms" with the assurance that they will update
their protocols as required (National Security Agency).

MEASUREMENT

Because quantum measurement devices leverage elementary particles to perform their measurements, they
promise never-before-seen levels of precision. Their potential applications are numerous, and the
understanding garnered from these measurement campaigns is likely to fundamentally alter our understanding
about nature and the way we approach scientific, economic, and security problems.

   Foundational to this effort is the development of optical clocks to offer greater precision over traditional
atomic clocks. While atomic clocks on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites have long been the standard
for global timing, quantum entanglement promises clocks that are even more precise (Merali, 2010). Recalling
the PEACOQ photon detector, the need for a very precise time to register those detections becomes apparent.
As in PEACOQ, individual photons are detected with time increments as precise as 100 trillionths of a second
(O'Neill, "NASA's quantum detector achieves world-leading milestone." NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ,
2023).

   In fact, the development of these "optical atomic clocks" is an essential complement to the development
of other technologies that require such precise measurements. Quantum LIDAR, for example, bounces laser
light off of an object, and receives back individual photons--rather than reflected pulses as in traditional
LIDAR or radar (Bowler, 2019). A potential military application of this technology is the detection of stealth
aircraft (Buchholz & Mariani, 2020), but it is also likely to find application in fields where traditional LIDAR
has proved invaluable like archaeology, shoreline monitoring, and urban planning (American Geosciences
Institute. , 2023). Additionally, quantum versions of interferometers, magnetometers, and Rydberg sensors
for radio-frequency measurement are other technologies under investigation, and like quantum LIDAR and
quantum radar, they allow for finer measurements than are possible with traditional technologies (Manu,
2023).

   Although interferometry can be applied to many disciplines, the most intriguing applications come in the
field of gravimetry. In 2018, a company called AOSense, Inc. built a gravity interferometer that is small enough
to be hosted on a satellite and could be the precursor of sensors used to measure gravity waves from black
holes or to "measure the interior structure of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets" (Keesey, 2018). Similar
applications for Earth include using quantum gravimetry to monitor glacier and water flow as part of the study
of climate change (Keesey, 2018), sensing the shift of magma within volcanoes, and surveying underground
mines and tunnels prior to beginning construction projects (Bowler, 2019). Potential military applications of
this technology include detection of underground bunkers, tunnel complexes, or storage facilities and even the
detection of submarines underwater (Buchholz, Mariani, & Routh, 2020).

IMPLICATIONS FOR SPACE OPERATIONS
This chapter has discussed the unusual physical properties that underlie quantum technology and provided
insights into the efforts to advance quantum computing, communications, encryption, and sensing. These
categories are vast and are each worthy of deeper investigation. Like the products of the digital revolution
before it, quantum technologies are likely to transform every aspect of society from defense to the economy.
For space operations, the transformations are likely to fall into two broad categories. The first set of
implications concerns applications that will help us gain new knowledge or apply new methods to our current
ways of doing things. The second set of implications involves those applications that are likely to entirely
supplant our current methods.

   To begin once again with computing, it is anyone's guess what kind of new fuels, materials, or chemical
compounds advanced quantum computers and simulations may develop for space applications. One might
most obviously apply such technologies in the design and construction of satellites or in the optimization of
orbits or sensor collection tasking. One might even envision a satellite with quantum computers on board
to process the vast amounts of data gathered by quantum sensors or to communicate with other quantum
computers on the ground. The extreme cold in space would aid the supercooling needed for quantum
computers to operate, and it has been suggested that the lunar surface would provide an excellent location for
the construction of quantum computers (Cannon, 2022).
                                                                                  THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW] | 631

   Meanwhile, NASA's Laser Communications Roadmap outlines a plan to continually advance laser
communications capabilities, employing them in future Artemis and deep-space missions for high-capacity
video feeds and sensor data relay (Schauer, 2022). When coupled with the high-data-rate production of
quantum sensors, this infrastructure will provide unprecedented amounts of information about the space
environment, planets, gravity, and the Earth. It is likely that this technology will continue to expand in the
commercial sector, as well, and just as there are numerous applications for commercial space-based sensing,
there are likely to be remarkably similar applications for quantum sensors in those same fields.

   If the data produced by these quantum devices requires encryption for transmission back to Earth, then
quantum encryption may be applied to the transmission of digital data. China's Micius satellite has already
demonstrated QKD encryption at transcontinental distances, so we should expect broader application of
similar techniques to secure data transiting among satellites and ground stations (Bernhardt, 2019). Of course,
data created by traditional computers can also utilize quantum encryption to enhance security, so broader
applications in that area are likely, as well.

   Finally, with the tremendous amount of data already collected by remote sensing satellites, quantum
computers operating quantum algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm, could offer a "quadratic speedup" in
data processing under certain conditions--that is, at a power of two faster than classical algorithms (Bernhardt,
2019). The vast data stores produced by the quantum LIDAR or quantum gravitational sensors of the future
might require similar data processing.

   The second set of implications for space operations concerns the way in which quantum technologies
may supplant traditional space operations roles and functions. For the near term, all current satellite systems
and missions will remain necessary, but there is a chance that quantum technologies may lead to reduced
reliance on satellites in two key areas. First, because they can account for the extremely complex interaction of
multiple variables over time, quantum computations promise better-than-ever modeling of complex weather
patterns (Swayne, 2022). If sufficiently accurate, such models may reduce requirements for weather satellites.
Similarly, quantum accelerometers may make satellite constellations like GPS, Russia's Global Navigation
Satellite System (GLONASS), Europe's Galileo, or China's Beidou obsolete. There is already significant
interest in this technology to enhance inertial navigation accuracy of submarines that operate out of range of
GPS's radio signals and for ships that may have to operate in environments with electromagnetic interference
(Papadopoulos, 2022). Indeed, the role of positioning, navigation, and timing satellites may eventually be
eliminated entirely, and plans for such enhancements from the lunar surface (see, for example, NASA's Lunar
GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE) program) or GPS-like constellations around the Moon may prove
unnecessary.

CONCLUSIONS

The evolving technologies of quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum encryption, and
quantum sensing promise to affect every aspect of our lives. As discussed, these technologies operate differently
632 | THE QUANTUM FUTURE OF SPACE WARFARE [DREW]

than their digital counterparts, but that does not necessarily make them incompatible with the computation,
communications, encryption, and sensing methods currently in place. On the contrary, because quantum
technologies operate on foundational principles of the physical world that are more fundamental than their
digital counterparts (Bernhardt, 2019), the two can often go hand-in-hand, and it is an emerging best-practice
that quantum and digital methods are made to join forces when the capabilities of one complement the
limitations of the other. Such a complement occurs in the use of QKD encryption used to secure digital
information.

   We have further explored the utility of these technologies for space operations purposes. While NASA is a
leading agency in these development efforts, industry, academia, and defense entities are also keen to exploit
these technologies for their particular uses. While these representative technologies, like quantum LIDAR
and gravitational measurement, have obvious reconnaissance potential for the detection of disturbed soil or
submarines, they may also be applied to civil uses like the mapping of archeological sites from a distance. The
technologies are thus dual-use, and it seems quite likely that we are only scratching the surface of potential
applications of the technology.

   Still, quantum technologies are not a panacea for all civil, military, or space operations problems. Significant
challenges remain with largescale computing, the application of encryption to existing data, the protection
of existing communications methods to quantum incursion, and the scaling and ruggedizing of laboratory
equipment into more operationally useful packaging. Even when these challenges are overcome, it is almost
certain that classical computing, communications, encryption, and sensing will continue to have their
uses--sometimes even surpassing their quantum counterparts in usefulness or practicality. Whatever the
future may hold for these technologies, they will constitute only a handful of the countless options in the space
portfolio, but this handful of options promises to transform the technology landscape moving forward and
thus demands attention from experts in all fields of application.

WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE
APPLICATIONS [KHAN]

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Nearfield wireless power transfer (WPT) systems can benefit satellites having either standard or functional-
modular architecture because of their high efficiency when compared to a laser or microwave system. A
practicable wireless power transfer (WPT) system needs to maintain high transfer efficiencies while containing
electric and magnetic near fields for wireless satellite power applications. Nodes that do not have shielding can
become susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) both as a source and as a receiver. One way to deal
with this problem is to mitigate lateral emission in the unprotected zone between transmitter and receiver.
Early results show chiral ordering of a 4-tier WPT system can limit the unprotected lateral emissions by beam
shaping in the zone between transmitter and receiver during the charging process.

   Keywords-- Helical antennas, parasitic elements, wireless power transfer (WPT), near field, chirality,
frequency selective surfaces (FSS), satellite systems

INTRODUCTION

WPT systems can bring certain advantages to satellite systems having different architectures. Satellite wireless
buses help reduce cabling weight. To reduce EMI interference, while maintaining efficient power transfer in
a crowded field of electronic devices, one needs the near field shaping capability discussed here. The chapter
begins with a general discussion of WPT options and moves quickly on to the design and research conducted
of a system capable of beam shaping while maintaining high efficiency.

BASICS OF WPT SYSTEMS

WPT systems can be classified as near-field, mid-range, or far-field based on coupling distance (Triviño-Cabrera
et al., 2020). In near-field operation can be inductive or capacitive. Inductive systems can be further broken
down into magnetic resonant or non-resonant. In mid-range operation WPT systems use strongly coupled
magnetic resonant system (SCMR) which is similar to the resonant inductive systems but has greater range
636 | WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS [KHAN]

generally achieved by adding parasitic components to the coupling system. Far-field systems such as optical and
microwave systems have low efficiencies and require a larger payload volume and are therefore not suitable for
satellite deployment (Zhang et al., 2019). Our chosen application lies between magnetic resonant and SCMR
systems Table 17-1 compares these two technologies based on frequency of operation (f), wavelength(), and
largest dimension of coupling device (DMAXd).

                       Table 17-1 Comparison Magnetic Resonance and SCMR Systems

MOTIVATION
Depending on the architecture of the satellite system(s) WPT technologies can provide better immunity to
EMI and reduced weight from not using cabling. In a traditional architecture it can be used to transfer power
from solar panels to a receiver while in a modular spacecraft WPT can be used to provide power between the
modules. Our designed system has the ability to shape near fields which is critical to avoiding EMI interference
in satellites and can help reduce losses.

NEAR FIELD SHAPING

The primary goal of this research has been to limit near-field emissions for an efficient resonant WPT system
(Karalis et al., 2008; Kurs et al., 2007) i.e. to optimize transfer efficiency while keeping human safety in mind.
More specifically, our paper would like to further expand on early results that show, chiral ordering of a 4-tier
WPT system can limit the unprotected lateral emissions in the zone between transmitter and receiver (Khan,
Saeed & Bailey, Chad, 2021).

   The 4-tier system (Figure 17-1) is composed of chiral objects that are right-hand (RH) or left-hand (LH).
Both the helical transmitter and receiver can be considered to be chiral metaparticles (Caloz & Sihvola, 2020),
i.e. it has a length close to half a wavelength and a height that is much smaller than its length. The parasitic
elements are RH or LH chiral objects but do not necessarily meet the length requirements for metaparticles.
With sixteen possible arrangements are possible, the research will focus on two arrangements holding the most
promise from the perspective of field containment and efficiency. We assume that shielding (Wang, Zuming &
et. al., 2021) can be employed in other zones that do not impede the path of direct energy transfer which is
further clarified in the section on background.

EARLY RESULTS

Table 17-2 shows impact on field containment happening in the unprotected area between transmitter and
receiver (Note: RRRR indicates for four-tier system components are all right-handed; RLLR indicates only
parasitic elements are left-handed). Figure 17-3 shows field closer view of a system where all tiers are right-
hand. Also, efficiencies of the WPT system depend on the- chirality (right/left hand) order of the system (Table
17-2). Proper ordering can lead to 70-80+% measured efficiencies for distances of 5-20 cm. Higher efficiencies
(90%+) have been recorded through COMSOL simulations without accounting for measurement setup losses.
Resonant frequencies of the system have also been shown to depend on the chirality order of the four-tier
system. Frequency tracking capability is assumed (Chaidee et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Nam Yoon Kim et al.,
2012).

   The paper describes the work of a four-tier (transmitter-parasitic element-parasitic element-receiver)
resonant WPT system consisting of two helical antennas each with a conical helix serving as a parasitic element.
It focuses on E-field and H-field containment at high efficiencies through simulation and experimental work.
Based on the novel work (Khan, Saeed & Bailey, Chad, 2021) performed, there is a good possibility this
investigation will lead to a safe and efficient near-field transfer systems.

BACKGROUND

The successful design of a system that can safely transfer 100 kW or more of power over a 100-200 mm gap
under varying conditions of humidity, while maintaining high efficiencies, is a challenge for any person or
team. Effective implementation of the above specifications will be rewarded with a resonant (Kurs et al., 2007;
Barman et al., 2015) wireless power transfer system (WPT) that can support the charging of devices such as
electric vehicles (EIVs), drones (UAVs), and robots (UGVs) comfortably, even with the current state of storage
technology. In addition, a good wireless charger (Ahmad et al., 2018; Chittoor et al., 2021) is expected to
enable interoperability with a large tolerance for misalignment while meeting safety requirements.

   The basic structure of the proposed system (Figure 17-1) consists of a center-fed transmitting normal mode
helical antenna (NMHA) and an identical receiving NMHA helix loaded at the center (Imura et al., 2009).
Multiturn-helical antennas form efficient WPT systems (Barman et al., 2015; Imura et al., 2009) and while
NMHA mode requires the helix to be electrically small in height the overall length, using multiple turns, it can
be made to be about half a wavelength to qualify as a chiral metaparticle (Caloz & Sihvola, 2020). The parasitic
elements are conical helices which are at their minimum radius flush with the side facing the transfer gap.

   The use of parasitic elements in the structure is supported partially supported by the work by Andre Kurs et
al (Kurs et al., 2007) where efficient indirect WPT was reported between self-resonant transmitter and receiver
coils by way of using a feeder loop and loaded receiver loop. In another case, work done by K. Firdaus et al
shows (Firdaus et al., 2015) that a spiral slot with length comparable to half a wavelength has good transmission
                                                                                  WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS [KHAN] | 639

characteristics when placed between two identical right-handed helical antennas in a WPT system where the
transmitting helix and receiving helix are equidistant from the slot. The choice of 3-D chiral metaparticles as
parasitic elements seems to be the next step from placing planar objects between receiving and transmitting
helices, which have demonstrated a positive impact on coupling. Indeed, the parasitic elements in our design
are 3-D version of an achiral Archimedean spiral forming a chiral conical helix.

ANALYSIS OF PRELIMINARY RESULTS

Of the total sixteen possible 4-tier chirality orders eight can be considered to be equivalent to the other eight
e.g., RLLR is the chiral equivalent of LRRL. Measurements and simulations were run on eight structures
of which two (RRRR & RLLR) were found promising in terms of their efficiency (Figure 17-4). Note: Both
measurements and simulation results account for cable and connector losses. Comparing measured (with PVC
cylinder for alignment) and simulated (without PVC cylinder) has a mean efficiency difference of 5%.

    Table 17-2 -FIX shows impact on field containment happening in the unprotected area between
   transmitter and receiver (Note: RRRR indicates for four-tier system components are all right-

                     handed; RLLR indicates only parasitic elements are left-handed).

   These structures were also examined for their ability to control lateral emissions in the unprotected zone.
Simulation results from Table 1 compares two different 4-tier WPT chiral arrangements with a 2-tier one that

does not employ parasitic elements. From inspection, both RRRR and RLLR ordered systems provide better
electric field containment in the unprotected zone when compared to a system operating without parasitic
elements (RR). The RRRR order provides the best containment for the magnetic field. Figure 17-2 provides
a closer look at both the E-field and H-field containment by the RRRR arrangement.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

Measurement of Efficiency and Unprotected Fields:

  · 1 Introduction: WPT efficiency measurement has so far been conducted using a network analyzer using
      S-parameters and compared with simulation data while the study field emissions in the unprotected
      zone has been performed only through simulation. The purpose of this task is to design a Faraday cage
      experiment that measures both transfer efficiency and emissions in the unprotected zone for small
      amounts of power.

  · 2 Measurement Setup Design: Figure 17-5 shows schematic for how both efficiency and unprotected
      zone emissions are to be measured (Chakarothai et al., 2018). The design has been adapted from
      previous instrumentation (Figure 8) setup for measuring near-field transfer efficiencies for helical
      antennas (Khan & Maresch, 2013a) and includes the ability to measure lateral emissions.

  · 2.1 Measurement of Efficiency: The switch (Figure 17-5 ) should be connected to the power
      management system and a rectifier circuit while trying to find the efficiency of the WPT system. The
      following assumptions can be made during the process,

 1. The placement of the ferrite sheets does not significantly impact efficiency. Simulations run with and
      without this metal backed sheets seem to back up this assumption.

 2. The matching circuits of the rectifier system can be fine-tuned to the frequency of maximum transfer.

  · The amount of transfer time is chosen such that the charging does not exceed the storage capacity of the
      ultracapacitor bank.

Like most modern battery chemistries, ultracapacitors require balancing if placed in series. This prevents the
overcharging of one or more individual capacitors in a series string, which would cause a failure due to the
breakdown of the dielectric material. Balancing, therefore, adds extra circuitry, and with-it inefficiencies, which
could be avoided if the capacitors were placed in parallel. For this reason, and since capacitors add when in
                                                                                  WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS [KHAN] | 645

parallel, the prototype initially used a bank of parallel capacitors in series with a battery. Previous testing
resulted in longer than expected charging times. This was due to the RC time constant, as the DC resistance of
the circuit significantly contributes. Future designs will use series capacitors with balancing circuitry, or some
series/parallel combination.

  · 2.2 Measurement of Near-Fields: For this measurement the switch should be connected to the dummy

      load with about 200 W dissipation capability. The following points can be made for this measurement:
 1. The x-track (Figure 17-5) H-field and E-field measurements are going to be made adjacent to the WPT

      system in a horizontal line midway between receiving and transmitting antenna. Based on simulation
      results the fields should die off rapidly in this zone.
646 | WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS [KHAN]

 2. The z-track field measurement will also take place in a vertical line adjacent to the WPT system.
  · Both electric and magnetic probes can be adjusted for x, y, and z, field measurements.

  · 2.3 Expected Outcomes:
 1. Characterization of coupling efficiency measurements using low power source (up to 13 dBm) for

      separation distances of 5-20 cm using network analyzer.
 2. Characterization of coupling efficiency measurements using higher power source (50-100 W) for

      separation distances of 5-20 cm inside Faraday cage.
                                                                                  WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS [KHAN] | 647

  · E-field and H-field measurements in an XZ plane close and adjacent to the WPT systems for different
      power levels.

From the list above items I-II will enable us to judge the impact on efficiency with/without a rectifier and
power management system included. Item III will characterize the field penetration in the unprotected zone.

  · 3 Potential Problems and Alternative Approaches: The expected outcomes (I & II) which relate to
      efficiency measurements are unlikely to run into problems given prior experience in the required setups.
      While the design for near field measurements (outcome III) will certainly require careful planning and
      proper orientation of both electric and magnetic probes, the data is being gathered in a zone adjacent to
      the WPT system that is unlikely to impact power transfer. While some re-design may be needed for field
      measurements the results should be corroborated by simulation.

2 Study of Field Containment and Chiral Ordering:
   2.1 Introduction: The importance of field containment has been discussed in prior sections. This task

can focus on understanding the phenomenon by which parasitic conical helices are able to minimize field
penetration in the unprotected zone which is defined as the lateral shielded zone between transmitter and
receiver.

  · 2 Study of Simulated and Measured Data: The data gathered in Task 1 will be critical in establishing the
      field containment patterns from simulation by making experimental measurements. Relationships
      between field penetration, coupling distance and the frequency of maximum coupling are to be analyzed
      in this study. Initial studies conducted already indicate that the resonant frequency is lowered by 4-tier
      RLLR systems when compared to RRRR arrangements and 2-tier RR systems (Table. 3) and leads to
      the following questions,

 1. Why is there a difference in resonant frequency between RLLR and RRRR systems that have the same
      size?

 2. Is it possible that the parasitic elements in RLLR couple more strongly with the active elements than in
      the RRRR case as the lowering of resonant frequency might suggest?

  · What explains the better magnetic field containment in the RRRR case when compared with the RLLR
      case (as indicated by simulation results in Table. 1)?

 1. Why do both RRRR and RLLR have similar containment for the electric field?
 2. What role does chirality order play in questions I-IV?
648 | WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS [KHAN]

The answers to questions I-V will help develop an understanding of the mechanism of field containment using
WPT systems using chiral ordering leading to a more efficient and safe design.

  · 3 Study of Semi-analytical Approach: The approach taken thus far has relied on experimental
      measurements and simulation results, another approach might be to take a semi-analytical route. More
      specifically, explain the reason for differences in resonant frequency by studying coupling between the
      antenna and its parasitic element on the receiver side (I-II sec 2.2). Work done in calculating the mutual
      impedance of a dipole and a parasitic element suggests the proposed approach.

   Questions I-III from the previous section can be better understood by calculating mutual impedance
between the transmitting dipole and the near parasitic element. The higher resonant frequencies imply less
coupling in the RRRR case and is a likely cause of narrower beam, but this can be investigated further by
calculating the mutual impedance of a dipole and a parasitic element suggests a semi-analytical approach can
be useful in this process.

   Using a similar process (Visser & Lulu Chan, 2014) for near field WPT employing parasitic elements and an
active receiver and transmitter dipole for our design. It is possible to calculate the impedances Z11, Z12, Z13,
and Z14, by using 4 different values of ZL using simulation to provide for I1, I2, I3, and I4 for each of the load
impedances (Figure 17-7). The currents can be determined by simulation results using (using 4Nec2) and then
the results can be verified by experimental means using accessible ports. It is expected that the value of Z12 will
provide clarity to beam shaping and resonant frequency differences discussed earlier for RRRR and RLLR.
Experimental results conducted thus far seems to indicate lower levels of coupling between the transmitter and
its nearest parasitic element (Z12) from relatively higher resonant frequency in RRRR case.

   Some initial results using the semi-analytical is provided below (Figure 17-8-9) using the technique described
in the previous section. These results indicate that RLLR (ZM= 6951) is more strongly coupled than the
RRRR (ZM= 5619 ) 4-Tier structure at no load condition and possesses a lower resonant frequency and the
receiver voltage (V1) is higher assuming Z11=Z22 for the identical antennas. This approach needs to be further
examined using a loaded condition.

  · 4 Expected Outcomes: A better understanding of these important questions (sec. 2.2) will help design
      safe and efficient near field WPT systems i.e., a better understanding of chiral layering in near field
      coupling and how this 4-tiered systems impacts field containment and resonant frequencies.

  · 5 Potential Problems and Alternative Approaches: Measurements added by Task 1 will enhance our
      understanding of the questions posed in section 2.2. The approach takes a deeper dive into these
      questions from section 2.3 in and the calculation of mutual impedance between transmitting dipole and
      its parasitic element using similar technique used for dipoles (Visser & Lulu Chan, 2014).

FUTURE WORK

A past research endeavor (Khan, 2017, 2019; Khan & Maresch, 2013b) regarding resonators connected to the
same ground plane (Saeed Khan et. al., 2018) indicates the possibility that multiple devices can share wireless
power from the same receiver without rectification at the transfer frequency (Figure 17-10). This will allow
the advantage of using different power management systems within the payload i.e. if power can be transferred
from one receiver to several others without the need for rectification and DC conversion.

   Between the two configurations of single source multi-receiver architecture (Figure 17-10) the coupling
between the source and any receiver is seen to depend on the distance and is proportional to as would be
expected in the near field region of a radiator.

   A point of interest is in the connecting wires between ground planes. As seen in Figure 17-11 the thin
connecting wires behave as a single wire WPT line where the magnetic field seems to be contained. Also, these
wires are less likely to get impacted by EMI when exposed to impinging electrons and ions on the satellites in
orbit.

   Figure 17-10 From a single WPT receiver Nec4 simulation shows system (a) and (b) are operating
at almost 100% efficiency. All receivers are within the same near-field zone of the source
652 | WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS [KHAN]

   Another future research objective is to study the impact of using frequency selective (Bresciani et al., 1992;
Kuse et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2015; Mandal et al., 2020; Marhefka et al., 2007; Xing et al., 2020) surfaces (FSS) as
ground connectors specially designed to immunize against unwanted frequencies for an orbiting space vehicle.

SUMMARY
It has been shown that WPT with beam shaping can deliver EMI immunity and beam shaping with our design.
We began by describing how parasitic elements can help achieve high efficiencies and beam containment
by proper layering based on chirality of a 4-tier system using both measured results and simulations. A
semi-analytical approach was then used to gage the impact of parasitic components both from the resonant
frequency and mutual coupling point of view.

   We discussed the WPT systems that deploy connected ground planes in a single source multi-receiver system.
654 | WIRELESS POWER FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS [KHAN]

The simulation (Figure 17-10) demonstrates that configuration is also a near-field technique since the coupled
power to loads vary as 1/(distance)3 which agrees antenna theory. The application of this system can be used to
transfer power throughout the entire satellite and therefore a good target for future work. Some of the research
can be focused on ground plane connections using frequency selective surfaces (FSS).

SPHERICAL TRIGONOMETRY PRIMER

DECIBEL MATH

EW calculations are done using "dB" math. It allows manipulation of very large numbers such as

transmitted signal strength and very small numbers such as received signal strength. Numbers expressed in

decibels (or dB) form are logarithmic and follow the rules.[1] This permits the comparison of values that may

differ in many orders of magnitude. It is important to understand that any value expressed in decibel units is a

ratio converted to a logarithmic form. (Adamy D. , EW 101: A First Course in Electronic Warfare, 2001)

To Convert To Decibel Form (base 10 log)

Ratio (in dB) = 10 log (Linear Ratio)                               Eq. A-1

Example: convert 2 (the ratio of 2 to 1) to decibel form.

10 log (2) = 3 dB (rounded)

convert 1/2 (the ratio of 1 to 2) to decibel form.

10 log (0.5) = - 3 dB in EW, link loss and antenna calculations this is a useful factor.

A reverse way of looking at the process or converting back to a nonlogarithmic form is:

Antilog (logarithm number) = linear number in place of 10 (logarithmic number) Eq. A-2

So, antilog (3/10) = 2. See (Adamy D. , EW 101: A First Course in Electronic Warfare, 2001) or (Adamy

D. L., 2004) or (Adamy D. L., Space Electronic Warfare, 2021) for many examples of nauseating details and

helpful tables for common usage.

PLANE TRIG / EQUATIONS

To solve problems of elevation and azimuth of look angles associated with Earth Satellites, three-dimensional

(3-D) angular relationships are solved with Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. Plane Trigonometry deals with

triangles in a plane. The important relationships are:

Plane Trigonometry:

The Law of Sines: ;                                        Eq. A-3

Note: Lower case letters represent the lengths of a triangle's side, and upper-case letters are their associated

angles opposite the corresponding side.

The Law of Cosines for Sides: a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos A     Eq. A-4

The Law of Cosines for Angles: A = b cos C + c cos B       Eq. A-5

A right triangle is a plane triangle with a 90° angle. All triangles fall under the above rules.

Rules for Napier's right spherical triangles

sin a = tan b cotan B;  Eq. A-9

cos A = cotan c tan b;  Eq. A-10

cos c = cos a cos b;    Eq. A-11

sin a = sin A sin c     Eq. A-12

[1] To multiply linear numbers, add their logarithms; to divide linear numbers, subtract their logarithms; to
raise a linear number to the nth power, multiply its logarithm by n; and to take the nth root of a linear number,
divide its logarithm by n.
