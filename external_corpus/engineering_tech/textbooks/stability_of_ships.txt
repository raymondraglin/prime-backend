The doi registration of the book forced the examination of what is written in this book.
This abstract is the result of this examination.

Abstract

This book deals with stability of floating bodies. The approach taken in this book is
that of looking at the physical point of view on the stability. This means that instead
looking at regulations, the book examines why the things behave in a certain way. For
example, the book does not start with the archaic GM (metacenter approach) but deals
with the direct approach (today standard approach angle in angle out). While this
difference looks symbolic at first, the results are profoundly different. For example, in
the common approach it was assumed (actually it is deeply believed relic) that a change
in the cross section liquid line is irrelevant. As results, an upside triangle and downside
triangle have the same stability. Here in this book, it was found that during the floating
body tilting, the rotation point changes according to the tilting angle. The rotation
location is indirectly believed to be in the metacenter approach in M and M is assumed
to be at a fixed point for small angles. These two assumptions are wrong, the rotation
point is not around metacenter and the metacenter is not fixed (only under certain
circumstances).

    This method, used in this book, demonstrates that the turning point of the floating
body is at point A on the liquid line and it can move around. Are these discoveries
important? The answer is yes for most aspects and less important for others. With the
prediction of the floating bodies stability, both methods yield the same results. Yet,
the strength of the stability, even with the dimensional analysis improvement, that is
demonstrated in this book, has major issues. The most profound effect is the resonance
of container ship (and others). Ship are not regular pendulum but are double pendulum
that is they do not have regular frequency and amplitude but chaotic behavior for
medium and large wave. While this book is in the forefront of knowledge in this area,
there significant information needed to learn.

    Containers during marine transport are in demanded and are the preferred mode of
transportation. This method show that problems with the stability or the resonance
(rocking) of the body. This topic is related to the general resonance (rotation) which
is impacts the rotation point (see elementary physic book) The metacenter yields a

vi  ABSTRACT

wrong rotation point location and is not fixed as it is assumed (in the metacenter
approach). These issues are discussed in this book. The publication of the complex
double pendulum was published in this book.

    What should one do when ship is about to capsize? Add weight or reduce the weight
of the ship? This book utilizes the stability dome (that was create by this author) to
explain this phenomenon. For the first time the stability dome is displayed in the "main
hall" of the book.

    Dimensional analysis was applied to the ship stability and now a direct equation
or graphs shows the right results for your ship size. No tables are needed for various
ship sizes (compared to other books). The standard material preceding the stability
like centroid, moment of inertia, buoyancy, are discussed but at a higher level of the
physics.

    In fact, there is a tension among several forces or audiences for this book. On
the one hand, the book is intended for individuals who have a strong background in
mathematics, yet lack basic understanding the physics of (floating bodies) stability. As
anecdotal point, many the authors which dealt with rolling (which is kind of pendulum)
are not aware aware the moment of inertia depends on the rotation point. On the other
hand, the book is intended for ship architects and ship operators like ship mates and
engineers (this author was a ship engineer (third engine officer) in his youth). Personal
knowledge in the last group lacks the mathematical background, but has the physical
instinct and/or intuition. There is a third group is made of who invested so much in the
relic "science" that can not believe there should be other way. Hence, this book tries
to answer the first two groups and admittedly some parts of the book should be avoid
by the operators (too much theoretical math physics such as dealing with Lagrangian)
and some others should be avoid by other groups. As for the third group, in time they
will be diminished because they will eventually read the material and will understand
the new material. The number of the flat earth believers is diminishing today.

    Even this author sinned with believing some misconceptions that the field of ship
stability is infested with. Well, it is hard to clean so many entrenched "scientific" facts.
Note three notable "facts": rotation point (of the ship), the equation of motion of the
rolling rotations, the effects of the liquid in the ship on stability (one might described
the common approach as wrong), and fixing of the rotation point. The liquid line
area, (that is moment of inertia, etc) variation is be a minor misunderstanding . One
immediate effect is the understanding that ship are actually double pendulum which is
depends strongly on initial conditions This book is addressing all these challenges and
more.

    The reader would find material in this book to be revolutionary which was not
published before. Besides the direct stability concerns, issues like how many corners are
immersed in a rectangular shape in liquid at different angles are analyzed. Comparison
of stability on solid vs stability in liquid is presented, which is lack of all other books
on stability. The methods developed in this book also spill into geometry in which new
methods to calculate the centroid for a circular segment was developed. A test the
author has been given to various experts in the field which they failed to pass. Even
the experts who wrote books about ship stability, can benefit from this book to provide

a fresh prospective of the the new advances. While these statements sound dramatic
or brazen, it is believed that this book will transform how the stability field will be
approached in the future.

The greatest fear that this author has been the fear to introduce errors into the blood
stream of his writing. This statement not aim at typos, arithmetic mistakes, poor
English, and layout issues, and LATEX (there are still many errors in the style file) but
the big conceptional mistakes. This book embarks on the layout the foundation on
the stability of floating bodies. Naturally, there will be errors which hopefully will be
corrected during the author's life time. It already happened but it is not enough. This
author would not like to see that his work introduce omissions (like Bouguer's omission
of the effect of the cross area) or error on the calculations of added properties or solving
the equations of rotating body (ship) without knowing where is the hinge point (this
error so elementary that one wonder if, those who wrote it, skip the elementary physics
class.) I depends on the hinge location. Thus, in writing this book, points not clear
to the author are mentioned and left to other to contribute. If mistakes are found, the
new version discuss it and try to fix it as soon as possible before they enter the blood
and contaminate it. Thus, if you read the book, please try to get the latest version.
In this undersign book on fluid mechanics several mistakes (in ship stability sections)
are currently present (they will be corrected after this book improved) (well, they are
commonly believed truths, sorry for blaming others). As contribution to contamination
prevention, surface tension is not created by inter molecular forces (read about the book
"basics of the fluid mechanics."

After the rotation point of the floating body was established it must be followed by
issue of the rolling (resonances). From the six possible motions only three have any
potential drowning effect on the floating body (heave, pitch, roll). Of the three motions,
the rolling is the most important not only because the droning but also the resonance
(economical losses and comfort of passenger ship). Obviously, the change in the rotation
location changes the moment of inertia which prompted this author to look into this

area. In addition, while not expert in the area of added properties1, notice misconception
about this issue in the research paper on this area. Hence, the rolling chapter was born.
The experiments chapter was long in consideration and was inspired by Dr. Robert
Ettema's work or others how have done it..

    While the several topics that planed to be covered like liquid and characteristic time
effect on stability and other the book approaching to the maintenance phase like a work

Again, it is hard to believe how much one can achieve in a single book. Beside the
visual enhancement to the book the dimensionless presentation of what other call GZ
was constructed. History like to repeats itself. The great scientist E.R.G. Eckert wrote
his heat transfer book where he introduced dimensional analysis to the field. He was
mocked and ridiculed, but after 20 years the Eckert's approached is the only used today.
A similar thing happened to this author in the Pressure Die Casting field. It is a question
what will in this field.

    Several examples were enhanced and correction of typos were done. Improvements
of the visual will continue but mostly at this stage a discussion on the rolling frequency
will be analyzed. At that stage the major work on this book will shift to maintenance
(minor improvements). This author will (hopefully) shift focus to thermodynamics and
heat transfer and especially focus on biological system.

It is very proud moment to observe all the achievements that were done in writing
this book. Normally, it is hard to see significance of the one book. However, it is
moment one should be able to boast about amount of achievements. In fact, this is a
field that is so outdated and with "facts" that are so entrenched with no challenges.
For example, around what point does the ship roll? Fact, the entrenched answer is
around the metacenter which is wrong. In this book, basically, the author discovered
and demonstrated that the rotation depends on the cross section at the liquid line due
to the new method developed in the book.

    Furthermore, the fact that no one utilized Nusselt's technique is strange. Why
did no one use the dimensional analysis in presenting the stability diagram? Is that
presentation so hard? As a result, now the location of stable zones are clear. One
indirect effect of the stability analysis provides straight and easy way to calculate the
segment (part of circular) centroid. All the graphs showing the GZ in what is referred

    1Added properties referred to the fact that bodies operating in heavier liquid (like a ship) cause
resistance not by friction to the movement. This author never contributed to this area and simply took
a class on this topic and was a Teaching Assistance for this class later.

to sometimes as the right hand arm are smooth. This is another one of the entrenched
misunderstanding of the stability field.

    Still there are several topics that need clarifications that this book did not provide.
It is hoped that others will start to provide significant work that merit inclusion in
this book. For example, the dynamic stability analyzed in these days (2021) utilizing
numerical calculations. It is not that the numerical calculations are wrong. It is said
garbage in garbage out. For example, a paper (Hu, Ramlingam, Meyerson, Eckert, and
Goldstein 1992) carried the author (previous) name (Meyerson, without permission).
The correct thing in that paper is the experiments that this author solely had done and
were stolen without permission. The model in that paper is wrong because it failed to
take into account the right physical phenomenon. Is it the same for stability models
present in the recent books? This author is not convinced, hence no section in this book
can be presented on these topics. Yet, all the issues related to the safety regulations
should appear in future.

This author's introduction to ship stability was during 1974 where he was at Akko
Nautical College a unique and special high school. The class was taught by a big
man (size wise) as a main instructor who used to be captain and at time worked as
psychologist. The first class was extremely interesting because his unique ability to
handle boys2. However, because the class was after a war, it was carried in a condensed
fashion (over 8 hours a day for two weeks) to fulfill missing material. The most of
material taught was produced by the French Pierre Bouguer. For example, the numerical
integration was done by the trapezoid method, the Metacenter etc. It is interesting that
the instructor or his co-teachers did not know about the Bouguer himself.

    Since that class, the author has worked on various stability3 problems like the stability
of thin film (small and large waves) in relationship to energy transfer in his Masters at Tel
Aviv University. Later the author worked on various stability problems in compressible
flow. Additionally, the author work on stability problems in multi-phase flow. After the
author went through these various stability problems, coming again to ship stability this
author realized how old technology has been frozen in time (over 300 years). There were
two attempts, that the author is aware, to bring to update the ship stability science.
The first one from Paul Erd쮗s and second from Lautrup. The first is a mathematician
who did the mathematics correctly yet messed up some elements from a physics point
of view. The second is by a Danish physicist who had too much respect to the old
tradition, and yet he was able to renovate and focus on concepts like the stability
diagram. This author will refer to diagram as Lautrup's diagram.

    Perhaps the most amazing is the lack of dimensionless analysis of the stability of

    2A very talented man in taking command of mischievous teen age boys. The author is ashamed of
the things that his group used to do.

    3Even actually doing every morning stability calculations for ship as part of his duty. Not really
scientific but sheer fact of dealing with it.

ships and other bodies. That is, what is the significance of GM=2m. Is it the same
effect on a big ship as compared to a small ship? The ship size has a strong effect and
dimensional analysis done only recently by several brave students from Egypt (Habib,
Ali, and Nawar 2018). Nevertheless, proper analysis utilizing Nusselt's method was done
in Fluid Mechanics book by this author for the first time.

    This is the partial list of achievements in this book.

      The development of the angle in angle out approach for stability.

      The recognition that stability is a problem that deals solely with rotation.

      The proper usage of dimensional analysis within the stability analysis.

      The discovery of the effect of the change of cross area with the height on the
        stability.

      Construction of universal stability diagram for many fundamental geometrical
        shapes.

      Presentation of the GM in a dimensionless form for several geometrical shapes.

      Presentation of the correction gravity centroid needed to make the body stable.

      Discuss the differences between stability on solid and liquid

      Point to interdependence of the different rotations. In other words, the mechanism
        of the transfer for one motion to another was explained.

      Drive the relationship between the inclination angle and rotation point, and its
        derivative was obtained.

After reading this book one can answer questions that before one could not. For
example, if you are on a boat which is about to be roll what should you do? Remove
items and throw them overboard, or add more items like filled out buckets full of water,
and why? If you were using all the books you could not answer this question.

    This book is the fourth book in the series of POTTO project books (not counting the
world large gas dynamics tables). POTTO project books are open content textbooks so
everyone is welcome to join in. The topic of stability mechanics was chosen because the
discovery or the development of the direct methods. And the fact, this author wanted
to write a book that will be used by his old high school.

    This book is written in the spirit of my adviser and mentor E.R.G. Eckert. Eckert,
aside from his research activity, wrote the book that brought a revolution in the educa-
tion of the heat transfer. Up until Eckert's book, the study of heat transfer was without
any dimensional analysis. He wrote his book because he realized that the dimensional
analysis utilized by him and his adviser (for his post doc), Ernst Schmidt, and their
colleagues, must be taught in engineering classes. His book met with a strong criticism
in which some called to "burn" his book. Today, however, there is no known place
in world that does not teach according to Eckert's doctrine. It is assumed that the
WHY ABSTRACT  xiii

same kind of individual(s) who criticized Eckert's work will criticize this work. Indeed,
the previous book, on compressible flow, met its opposition. These criticisms will not
change the future or the success of the ideas in this work. As a wise person says "don't
tell me that it is wrong, show me what is wrong"; this is the only reply. With all the
above, it must be emphasized that this book is expected to revolutionize to some degree
the field and change some of the way things are taught.

    This book is written for several groups like high school students who study ship
stability, sea officers (even skipper), and for university students, hence the additional
material is required to satisfy these conflicting interest.

    The book is organized into several chapters which, as a traditional textbook, deals
with basic mathematics, than fundamental of mechanics, and fluid statics. Later several
chapters will be dealing with various aspect of the floating stability.

Preamble

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to
copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or non-
commercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to
get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made
by others.

    This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the
document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General
Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because
free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals
providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to

software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

Applicability and Definitions

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this
License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
requiring permission under copyright law.

    A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into
another language.

    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of
the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is
in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathe-
matics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or
with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.

    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are desig-
nated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document
is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary
then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there
are none.

    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover
Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under
this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
be at most 25 words.

    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, repre-
sented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable
for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images com-
posed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing
editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to
a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image
format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".
LIST OF FIGURES                          xxxv

    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without
markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly
available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed
for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF
and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing
tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following
pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the
title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page"
means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.

    A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ
in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below,
such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means
that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered
to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:
any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no
effect on the meaning of this License.

                 2. Verbatim Copying

    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license
notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies
you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions
in section 3.

    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
publicly display copies.

                 3. Copying In Quantity

    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers)
of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires
Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher
xxxvi                                                   LIST OF FIGURES

of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.

    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should
put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue
the rest onto adjacent pages.

    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than
100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each
Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard
network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time
you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well
before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you
with an updated version of the Document.

       4. Modifications

    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the condi-
tions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under
precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a
copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
    Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any,
    be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as
    a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
    authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least
    five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
    fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.

C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
    publisher.

D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
    copyright notices.
LIST OF FIGURES                                xxxvii

F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
    permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the
    form shown in the Addendum below.

G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required
    Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item
   stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version
   as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Docu-
   ment, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document
   as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as
   stated in the previous sentence.

J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to
   a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in
   the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the
   "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published
   at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
   version it refers to gives permission.

K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each
    of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
   in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the
   section titles.

M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included
     in the Modified Version.

N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict
    in title with any Invariant Section.

O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify
as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at
your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their
titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

    You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but
endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties-for example, statements of
peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
definition of a standard.
xxxviii                               LIST OF FIGURES

    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of
up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified
Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you
may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
the old one.

    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give per-
mission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any
Modified Version.

         5. Combining Documents

    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you
include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical
Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant
Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section
unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined
work.

    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the vari-
ous original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any
sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You
must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".

         6. Collections Of Documents

    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released
under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various
documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.

    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individ-
ually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted
document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
that document.

         7. Aggregation With Independent Works
LIST OF FIGURES                       xxxix

    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and indepen-
dent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called
an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When
the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other
works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the
Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the
Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within
the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

                 8. Translation

    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations
of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with
translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license
notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

    If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or
"History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically
require changing the actual title.

                 9. Termination

    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly
provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or
distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

10. Future Revisions Of This License

    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free

           How This Book Has Been Written

The Smart-ass Questions

As a typical phenomenon every time this author gets into a new field questions from
individuals who try to challenge the intellect of this author are asked (Wow, why people
repeat the same approach?). Basically the individuals claim that because it was done in
a certain way for over 300 years and with million of dollars in research it must be correct.
Similar things were said for the other advances that this author has made in the past.
Thus, these remarks just increase the interest into the investigate. The investigation
into the rolling was prompted indirectly by these kind of questions.

More info

This author's initial research original interest was not focused on ship (bodies) stability.
All colleagues of this author are not in the area of ship stability but multi-phase flow,
heat transfer etc. Yet, when writing stated, this author approached several individuals
who have worked in this area from U.S.A. None of them was cooperative but yet all have
been polite (probably they heard about Bar-Meir), but strangely considerable email has
come from the far east and the middle east (why?). This stream of questions led to
the additional material which is about 40 pages.

Initial

This book started because I found or developed a new way, after hundred years, to
calculate the stability limits. While Simpson's role was penetrating to the stability field
displacing the trapezoid integration there still ancient approach like lake of dimensional
analysis approach which must be updated. Perhaps, this book is written by this author,
who has non conforming and none traditional approach, will move the field to modernity
(as 2021) as a result of writing this book.

    The book started as to attempt to teach my kids experimental physics in hopes that
they will like and want to be engineers. This attempt failed to get them to be interested
in engineering yet this book was born.

    The famous Eckert converted the field of heat transfer to a dimensional(less) science.
Hence, it hope that tables (using big ships, small ship etc.) that appear in ship stability
books like (Derrett and Barrass 1999; Biran and Pulido 2013) should be located only
in library learning about the history of the issue.

xlii  LIST OF FIGURES

    There are several books on stability of floating bodies but none them is open content.
The approach adapted in this book is practical, and with more hands-on approach. This
book indented for many different and conflicting audiences and that creates a difficulty
in writing a book. So, issue of proofs and so on are here only either to explain a point
or have a solution of exams. Otherwise, this book avoids this kind of issue.

    The structure developed in the author's book on fluid mechanics was adapted and
used as a scaffolding for this book. This author was influenced by material that he was
taught in high school, but this material will be ignored in this textbook. The chapters
are written in an order that assume reader has little background knowledge.

    The presentation of some of the chapters is different from other books because the
new ideas and usability of the computers. The book does not provide the old style
graphical solution methods, yet provides the graphical explanation of things.

    Of course, this book was written on Linux (Micro$oftLess book) using the vim editor
for editing (sorry, never was able to be comfortable with emacs). The graphics were
done by ipe, a new graphic program that this author is learning to use (and which is
user friendly with poor documentation yet there no better package.). The figures were
done by GLE. The figure in cover page was created by Genick Bar-Meir, and is copyleft
by him.
                                           Preface

       "In the beginning, the POTTO project was without form, and
      void; and emptiness was upon the face of the bits and files. And
      the Fingers of the Author moved upon the face of the keyboard.
      And the Author said, Let there be words, and there were words."
      4.

This book, Stability of Ships and Other Bodies, describes the fundamentals, when
and why floating bodies are stable. In addition, it describes steps that transform un-
stable bodies to stable ones. This book is designed to replace all the other books
and inseminate and integrate the recent developments, technology and advances. The
material in standard books is so entrenched, archaic, and outdated material that one
can be only amazed. For example, concepts like potential stability are not discussed
or even mentioned in any of the books that this author reviewed. One of the recent
subject study is the resonance of rolling. One should expect that at the very minimum
the location of the rotation should be known or well defined. However, none who work
in the area and was asked knew what is location of rotation point was.

       Stability naturally makes itself subject to dimensional analysis examination. There
are no extraordinary situations like multi-phase flow. Yet, only one attempt was made
to introduce it to stability analysis. Stability analysis is a well established topic in
engineering, physics, economics. The technique is done by introducing error and looking
if the error grows or decay. Bouguer found obscure and a different technique because at
his time the regular standard was not available or known. Now that we have a regular
standard approach there is no reason to avoid especially when it capture major stability
issues that were not known because of the metacenter technique.

       This book was written from a physical point of view rather than of this what
the safety committee decided like all the books reviewed by this author on stability.
It is hoped that the book could be used as a reference book for people who have at
least some basics knowledge of science areas such as algebra, basic physics, etc. Even
without deep understanding, the graphs in this book can be used to find necessarily
quantities needed to understand or to fix your vessel.

       The structure of this book is such that many of the chapters could be usable
independently. I hope this approach makes the book easier to use as a reference manual.
However, this manuscript is first and foremost a textbook, and secondly a reference
manual only as a lucky coincidence.

       I have tried to describe why the theories are the way they are, rather than just
listing "seven easy steps" for each task. This means that a lot of information is presented

    4To the power and glory of the mighty God. This book is only attempt to explain his power.

which is not necessary for everyone. Many in the industry have called and emailed
this author with questions since this book is only source in the world of some of the
information. These questions have led to more information and further explanations
which are not available else where.

       This book is written and maintained on a volunteer basis. Like all volunteer work,
there is a limit on how much effort the undersigned was able to put into the book and
its organization. Moreover, due to the fact that English is my third language and time
limitations, the explanations are not as good as if I had a few years to perfect them.
Nevertheless, I believe professionals working in other engineering fields could benefit
from this information.

       I have left some issues which have unsatisfactory explanations in the book, marked
with a Mata mark (still under work). I hope to improve or to add to these areas in the
near future. Furthermore, I hope that other individuals will participateid in this project
and will contribute to this book (even small contributions such as providing examples
or editing mistakes/typos are needed).

       I have tried to make this text of the highest quality possible and am interested in
your comments and ideas on how to make it better. Incorrect language, errors, ideas for
new areas to cover, rewritten sections, more fundamental material, more mathematics
(or less mathematics); I am interested in it all. I am particularly interested in the
best arrangement of the book. If you want to be involved in the editing, graphic
design, or proofreading, please drop me a line. You may contact me via email at
"barmeir@gmail.com".

       Naturally, this book contains material that never was published before (sorry
cannot avoid it). Actually it is the main trust of the book showing the new way to
do old things. Brazenly putting it in bold words, this book contain material that was
never published before and does not adhere to social appeasing. This material never
went through a close content review. While close content peer review and publication
in a professional publication is excellent idea in theory, practice, this process leaves large
room to block of novel ideas and plagiarism. In fact, many ideas in the book intimidate
many who has vast interest to keep hidden. Image that spend year and millions of
dollar just to find that you made a mistake in research. It is naturally believed that
those individuals will attempt block any regular channel publication (this author has
experience it in the past). If you would like be "peer reviews" or critic to my new ideas
please send me your comment(s).

       Several people have helped me with this book, directly or indirectly. I would like
to especially thank to my adviser, Dr. E. R. G. Eckert, whose work was the inspiration
for this book. His approach in dimensional analysis was a key in understating concepts
like what dimensional group effect the stability but also the presentation.

       I encourage anyone with a penchant for writing, editing, graphic ability, LATEX
knowledge, and material knowledge and a desire to provide open content textbooks and
to improve them to join me in this project. If you have Internet e-mail access, you can

    1 Introduction to Stability

1.1 What is Stability of Floating Bodies?

The perquisite condition for stability of floating bodies regardless to usage is that the
body (ship) has to float. This condition is controlled by Archimedes's law or principle.
The stability of floating does not have vertical stability issue unless it is in a small scale
or the density is almost transitional1. That is, once the body is floating, unless the
body density is changed, there is no vertical stability concerns2 In other words, pushing
or pulling the body in the vertical direction will not change the fact of the body's
stability. The fact that ship has limitations on available flotation (how much ship can
load before it will sink) is not related to stability. In fact, it will be shown later in the
book that the ship become more stable when ship closer is fully loaded situation. This
limit related how much liquid the ship can absorb before it is too heavy to float (see for
more information in chapter 2).

       However, under what conditions the angle of a floating body will be in equilibrium
is the question of ship or body stability. Floating bodies do not sink if their density is
below the liquid density because lack of force or moment that can cause it. On the
contrary, when the body is pushed down below the stability point there is a net force
that pushes the body up and vice versa. However, the body is placed on the liquid, only
under certain conditions will the body remain in initial position. For example, putting

    1Lautrup suggested this possibility.
    2There are those who claim that there are issues with vertical stability. For example, an Australian
mathematician (his name is mentioned) wrote a paper on rolling, that he alleged that it is clear all six
motions are important. His claimed this strange "fact" because he does not understand physics. His
paper is dealing with pendulum like situation/scenario yet he does know where is the rotation point.
This author would like see even one issue/case vertical stability issue.

                                                     1
2               CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STABILITY

an extruded wood square in water straight up will results in a tilt to 45 (try it).
       A body placed over a solid surface will remain in the same conditions if the body

is placed only, at minimum, when the center gravity is over the base. The situation
with solid surfaces is very intuitive as most readers have experienced it for example, an
extruded square has 4 possible angles of stability (for the 2D bodies). As almost always,
the stability points (angles) are complicated to determine and to predict when placing
bodies on liquid. The stability points (angles) on the solid surface are different from
those for the same body on liquid. Even the number of stability points can be different
between solid surface and liquid surface. For example, an extruded T-shape body can 4
stability points on solid surface (orientation) while in liquid it can have only one or two.
As opposed to the solid case, in liquid the ratio of the densities affects the stability. The
stability for a certain shape can be checked by modifying the geometrical parameters
(or their ratio) of certain shapes for various density ratios. The experience has shown
that the stability can be plotted as ratio of geometrical parameters for different density
ratios as shown in a typical stability diagram (see Fig. 1.1).

   Geometry     Stable

             B            A

                Unstable

                                                                                    s
                                                                                    

             Fig. 1.1 - Typical stability diagram for solid bodies like extruded rectangular.

       It is amazing that for a certain geometry the ship or floating body is stable (see
point A in the Fig. 1.1) at one point and if the density ratio changes it becomes
unstable (the line enters into the dome) and if further change in the density ratio
occurs it becomes stable again (the line leaves the dome). This point is not obvious (at
least it was not clear to this author when he took ship stability class in high school.3).
In fact, ships have different scales for salt water and fresh water (they have different
densities, and they should have different scales for different temperatures). This diagram
is introduced (in Chapter 2). While this diagram is not related to the stability issue it
provided the power the density ratio is.

       This book is organized by building on the foundations, like what is a centroid and
how to calculate it. Additional important fundamental concepts will be introduced: the
moment of inertia, pressure. The buoyancy will be followed and analyzed. Later, these
ideas will be used in the calculation of the ship stability (and floating body and in this
book the word "ship stability" should be interpreted as floating bodies as well.) As all
the books by this author, the books starts with history of ship stability.

    3It is a good assumption that the teacher had no clue about this issue. In fact, a discussion with
another teacher (head teacher) simply demonstrates it is the prevailing belief.

1.2 History of Ship Stability

1.2.1 Original History

The history of the stability analysis is reflective of

general physics and fluid mechanics science in par-

ticular. A good summary is given by (Nowacki and

Ferreiro 2003) which lacks major developments that

have occurred in the last 30 years. The highlights of

stability analysis research show that it was an impor-

tant topic for a long time. Clearly having ship that

does not flipped at sea (or other body of water) was

important since the early times. The test was done      Fig. 1.2 - Bouguer Showing
by some individuals moving on the floating body to           Metacenter.
examine how the ship stable has. The real under-

standing to more advanced mathematics of the

stability is tied and fluid mechanics, without which there was no ability to examine this

issue. For example, Archimedes did not know about the concept of pressure, hence

he lacked a major tool in his understanding. The early work was done by Huygens

(1629-1695), (Huygens 1967) by that time he knew about the concept of pressure and

some knowledge of early calculus. Even the concept of "specific gravity" (density) was

introduced by that time (density was introduced 1586 by Simon Stevin). Stevin also

discovered that the forces (gravity and buoyancy) have to act in the same line as a

prerequisite for stability. French mathematics Paul Hoste, (1652-1700) made attempt

to tackle the stability problem, but failed because he did not know about calculus.The

famous case of the Swedish flag ship Vesa shown on the cover page during her maiden

voyage was turned to a no-return-point and eventfully sank. The king's, Gustavus

Adolphus, demands on ship's cannons were so high and heavy that it was ridiculously

absurd showing the contempt people had to science.

Euler was requested by the Russians (at the time he was Russian Tzer children's

tutor, what a lucky students) to review the work of La Croixs work (Euler 1735; Euler

1736). As usual, money was the reason pushing the science forward. That was the

age of discovery and the ability to project power especially with a marine power was

essential. During that era the ship's gunport was developed. The need to find the water

(liquid) line and maximum turning point before water got into the ship were important.

Hence the importance of developing the science behind the stability.

Pierre Bouguer French hydrologist (fluid mechanics) got his father is royal pro-

fessor post at the age of 15 after his father pass away (must have be very smart kid).
He improved the numerical integration methods (he invent the trapezoid method)4.

Later he derived the Metacenter concept (Bouguer 1746) see Fig. 1.2. This Metacen-

ter method is the most used method today. Yet, when one tries to use it, it is found

to be complicated and graphical representation (or numerical modeling) is commonly

required. Perhaps, the intrinsic deficiencies of this method is that it is confusing as to

    4This method is widely used in stability study even though there are simpler and better methods
like Simpson's rule or by its other name?

where the rotational point is and fails to capture the effect of liquid line cross section

area change on the stability.

   As a result, another method namely,

the potential/energy principle is or could

be used. In this method the energy or the             Yaw              Roll
potential of the system is written and uti-
lized to find stability points. This tech-                   top view        front view

nique was first proposed by Huygens and

again because lack of calculus developed       Pitch

at that time he failed to work out the tech-          side view
nical details.

   Paul Erd쮗s et al was the first (this

author is not aware of any who else worked Fig. 1.3 - Typical rotation of ship/floating body.

to solve this problem utilizing potential en-

ergy) to have used this approach successfully (Erd쮗s, Schibler, and Herndon 1992).

Amazingly the authors were not aware the centroid calculations were a well established

topic and used complex integral calculations to find the centroid of trapezoid (and these

calculations were done in 1992!). Additionally they have made some nonessential as-

sumptions which Mohammad Abolhassani was able to fix. The calculations of centroid

were not explained in the last paper (Abolhassani 2004). The potential method will be

explained briefly later on. This approach utilizes mathematics without the ability to see

or examine what cause what and why. In a way the method abstracts the physics and

converts it into a pure mathematical creation. The method seeks to find the angle(s)

in which the vertical distance between buoyancy centroid and the gravity/mass centroid

is shortest. Numerous mathematical papers (dealing with the mathematics) were pub-

lished later dealing with abstract. It is the opinion of this undersign that many of these

papers are without any real meaning to the stability of floating body. It is interesting

to point out that because the lack of physical observation ability or because the under-

lined the equilibrium analysis it was assumed that it is a dimensionally compartmental.

For floating bodies the stability is compartmental under very unique cases where the

body is symmetrical and extruded. For example, using marine terminology, roll rotation

creates yaw and pitch rotations because of the change of centroid location in x,y, and

z directions.

   The newest approach is the Direct Examination approach and it is suggested by

this undersign. The Direct Examination method is probably the closest to Metacenter

method.

   Example 1.1: Why G is above B                                 Level: Easy

   In the illustration 8.2 depicts G above B. Explain why at equilibrium stage the
   G and B must be in the same vertical action line.

   Solution

   One of the favorite question that this undersign brings to engineers. Assume that G
   is not the same vertical action line as the B. In that case, a moment is created and
1.3. ROLLING ROTATION                                                                        5

                                                                             End of Ex. 1.1
the body will rotate until G and B do so on the vertical action line.

1.2.2 Recent Developments

Some developments have occurred recently will be presented in this section. Among
these recent developments of the ship stability is the stability diagram/dome. The
stability diagram is an important tool showing the stability of a certain geometrical
body. The investigation of history this diagram is not conclusive. While it is too
personal for this author, as he built these diagrams and he was sure that he is the first
(it is a disappointment to find that someone invented them head of you). However, it
seems that the credit should go toward to Lautrup (Lautrup 2011). While the coordinate
system presented in Lautrup book is different (and there is only one diagram) but the
concept is somewhat similar. Lautrup did not realized that this is a typical diagram and
it can be built for different geometries and maybe he did not attempt to build one for
other geometries. Another advance Lautrup should be credited for is the solution of the
principle axis.

       Almost the investigation (research) on the ship stability was under the assump-
tion of compartmental effect5. Perhaps, the only transfer mechanism discussed in the
literature is the mechanism of the moving wave along x coordinate which makes rolling
motion (but these special cases that are discussed later). For example, the potential
energy implemented by Erd쮗s (Erd쮗s, Schibler, and Herndon 1992) worked under the as-
sumption of compartmental effect. This separation is not correct and was demonstrated
in (Bar-Meir 2021).

       Beside the potential energy, this undersigned developed the Direct Examination
method which is simpler to understand and implement (Bar-Meir 2021). Addition-
ally, the author introduces the dimensional analysis to this area. There are quite new
advances in this book and recently developed and they will be discussed below.

1.3 Rolling Rotation

Any body has six possible movements which have special names relative to a ship in
the marine industry. The most dangerous and important because commercial damages
is the rolling which refers to rotation around the small dimension of the ship (in other
words the long axis). The complicate question what happened to a body under rotation
not in the principle axis really was not addressed yet because lack of understanding.

       The damages created by rolling rotation are exhibits in the example of Fig. 1.4.

    5If you aware of such non compartmental work, please notify this author.
6  CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STABILITY

           Fig. 1.4 - Containers falling from a their location on a ship after rolling rotation.

These damages are very substantial (according many sources). According to research
conducted by the World Shipping Council, on average 1,390 shipping containers are lost
at sea each year, whilst in 2019 there were approximately 16,000 lost cargo containers.
These numbers are only an approximation and the number of damaged (damaged is
more than lost) containers are higher. Regardless, of this specific information (it is
not scientific and has a very small amount of material to verify facts), it is estimated
the majority are due to the rolling rotation (not clear as of writing this section). This
information is considerable enough to warrant an examination of lost and damaged
containers.

       Rolling is extension of static stability which was covered earlier. The metacenter
method is almost exclusively used by researchers in this area (this author did observe
even a single publication utilizing any other method). The weaknesses of the metacenter
method are abstracting and the belief that the ship's rotation point is at metacenter
and which can be assumed to be fixed for small angles. That is, the rolling rotation
is like a giant pendulum movement. Clearly, if this assumption was correct then at
first glance the equation used in pendulum should be applied. Even this author sinned
with this erroneous assumption. The literature survey shows that the oldest publication
found is from 1939 (Rahola 1939) 6 and the work referred to as Rahola's criteria. These
publications are relatively recent (Francescutto 2007).

    6The first curious thing about this work is who were the sponsors. Were they Nazis or Nazi
sympathizers. If you have any information, please provide it to this author.
1.3. ROLLING ROTATION                                                                     7

The next issue was to find the energy

source or in other words the external (excit-

ing) force or moment that causes the reso-

nance (Spyrou and Thompson 2000; Bulian,

Francescutto, and Fucile 2009). This physi-

cal situation had to be converted to a math-

ematical model. As always engineers when

the situation cannot put into a model, in-

vent a safety factor relative to something

that was known at the time. Thus, the

weather conditions are based simply on the

GM with a coefficient that is obtained from

the formula Eq. (1.1) (Francescutto, Serra,    Fig. 1.5 - The Correction for the weather
and Scarpa 2001). The roll-back angle is            based on GM. The references to other
written as,                                         papers that appear on the exhibits
                                                    are leftover the paper by Frances-

                                               cutto.

 = 109 k X1 X2 We Ws            (1.1)

The roll-back angle is a kind of ship twisted angle. Where the terms k and X1

and X2 represent the damping (not clear how? it is based on Newman book Marine

Hydraulic, which are based on Buckingham Dimensional Analysis which makes this

author very suspicious of their scientific validity.). While We is the waves effective wave

slope, Ws is the regular wave steepness at resonance frequency. The 109 coefficient

was chosen to match the data. This information associated with the Fig. 1.5. This

weather criteria was improved but the change does not seem to be significant and the

main point demonstrates that rotating point was ignored.

Galeazzi et al (Galeazzi, Blanke, and Poulsen 2012) have noticed that there is

relationship between the various six movements of the ship7. They also speculated that

it results from the change of the buoyancy centroid which was corrected but the expla-

nation did not appear. However, they connect the change to any physical effects.This

oversimplification lead to improvements which depend on the dynamic conditions (in the

literature it is referred as operational conditions) (Petacco and Gualeni 2020). One of

the typical theory was a wave propagates along ship (x coordinate) and hence changes

the buoyancy point and hence makes the ship vulnerable at specific frequencies. Ac-

cording to this idea for waves with a wave ship length (or some fraction (1/2, 1/4, etc)

of the ship in such away that a wave crest pears one per ship length cause a change in

GM (change in the metacenter). The change in GM causes the ship to have a varied

stiffness depending on the wave crest location. The arrangement is such that ship will

over respond in part of the cycle and will under respond in the other part the ship

situation that can create capsizing. One can wonder why not slightly change the ship's

velocity to solve the problem.

In this book, ship rolling is recognized as a special pendulum movement (actually

special double pendulum) where the rotation point is fluctuating. The addtional compli-

cation of varing moment of inertia of the ship changes during the rotation. Additionally,

7It seems to based on Newman (Newman 2018).
8  CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO STABILITY

in this book it was identified that added moment of inertia is a strong function of the
angle. The fact the ship has moving hinge point that changing means that the moment
of inertia is changing during the rotation.

1.4 Summary

It interesting to observe how the important Bouguer affected the field of ship stability.
The realization of the change of buoyancy centroid is the critical point in the under-
standing. Later it can be observed that this great personalty plus freezing effect the
Buckingham's method had on the stability.
    2 Marine Bodies Definitions

2.1 Opening Remarks on Definitions

Marine nomenclature dominates (obviously) the ship or the floating bodies stability.
While trying to find what is known and what is still a black art, this author concluded
that the terminology is used to complicate the topic. Furthermore, it seems that many
books on ship stability written is such jargon that it is hard to read them especially if
the reader is out of the field. In a way the chapter is a kind of dictionary or key that is
provided to be able to read books in the area.

       Hence, this chapter presents a literature survey on the nomenclature. In this
book, a minor adaptation of some of this terminology is reused. This old terminology
is entrenched and appear as ancient relic of outdated an science frozen for 300 years.
Some terms were changed to reflect the advances in science or specifically the new
technology developed here. Furthermore, this material is backported into other books
(for example, "Basics of Fluid Mechanics") and hence the terminology of the wider
field is preferred. In a typical stability analysis (in fluid mechanics and solid mechanics)
there is a typical disturbance which result in change of the field (where the disturbance
grows or decayed). In ship stability, the metacenter method does not have such concept.
For example, for a stability indication is whether GM positive or negative but further
more the analysis assumes that the metacenter is fixed regardless to the disturbance
. Therefore, for this author, who started his career a thermofluid with a ship stability
class, is forced to modify many terms.

       Yet, the terms like left or right of the ship are not used (but rather port (left) and
starboard (right)), are used adapted here because they do not conflict with the standard
fluid dynamics field. These terms can trace their root to the Vikings (Hendrickson 2008).

                                                     9
10  CHAPTER 2. MARINE BODIES DEFINITIONS

       The main definitions are dealing with sizes and not naming. The first definition

is dealing with volume of a ship. The width of ship is denoted as b and height of ship
is D and the length of the ship is s. Notice the lower case d is only part of the D
and it is the distance from bottom to the liquid level1. In some books this quantify is

denoted as T (not in this book). The displacement is volume displaced by the ship or
the floating body denoted as V0. The encompassing volume

    Vd = d b s    (2.1)

Note that some books refers to the displacement as the displaced mass or the displaced
weight (yes, these strange definitions are common).

2.1.1 Salinity and temperature effects

In the ship industry the minute change of density due to salinity and/or temperature
(about 2%) appear in approximation as

    dsal  f resh  (2.2)
    df resh  sal

The fresh water density is approximated as 1000 [kg/m3] and the density of sea water
is approximated as 1025 [kg/m3]. The temperature has small effect and yet also appear
as seasonal. In other words, the seasonal refers to Summer, Winter, etc. Eq. (2.2) can

be derived from Archimedes's formula (will be covered in Buoyancy chapter). It has

pointed that temperature play role nevertheless the changes are negligible.

2.1.2 Load Lines

Load lines are marked on a vessel's side for various conditions water salinity, and tem-
perature. Yet, the common in the industry to make them on the ship

    1Notice that in this book the term liquid is used and not water. The reason for this is to indicate
that apply to any kind of liquid and not limited to fresh or sea water.

0.9 From the top with smaller density from the top: TF is tropical fresh water, F for
fresh water, T is for tropical seawater, S is based and the summer seawater, W is the
winter seawater, and WNA is winter North Atlantic. The major part of the standard is
dealing the thickness of the lines etc. One can wonder how this relic still in use. The
answer to that has to do with historical validation and people respect things that have
been used for long.

2.1.3 Tonne Per Centimeter

This definition deals with the amount weight that increase the weight of the ship per
centimeter. It is strange that this definition is not defined in a scientific way like the
following

T P Cproper = dW                     (2.3)
                   dh

In this case, dh refers to the infinitesimal height element and dW is the ship weight
element. Regardless the definition, the assumption is that the cross area (parallel liquid
surface) does not change much with the height (in other words, cross area is almost
constant). In fact, this definition should be a function (example of how outdated
material is currently in marine industry).

       There two extreme cases of displacements one: Light Displacement two: Load
Displacement is the weight of the liquid displaced by a ship when at summer time in salt
12                      CHAPTER 2. MARINE BODIES DEFINITIONS

water for maximum load (conflicting requirements, salt and temperature are pushing
to different directions.). The ship's displacement lay between these two extremes. The
light displacement included fuel, stores, ballast etc which referred as "deadweight."
Deadweight Coefficient describes the effectiveness of the ship. It is defined as

    CDW = Light Displacement                                                    (2.4)
                   Displacement

This value is a dimensionless number. Basically it describes the useless fraction of the
ship weight. The typical values are

    Table 2.1 - Typical values for dead weight coefficient.

       Vessel Type      CDW        Vessel Type               CDW
    General Cargo Ship   0.7  Carry Wheeled Cargo             0.3
    Oil Tanker          0.83  Container Ship                  0.6
    Bulk Carrier        0.82  Passenger Liners               0.37
    Gas Tanker          0.62  Cross-channel Ferry             0.2

Some of these vessels type carry heavy weight and it is very wasteful.
       The block coefficient is defined as the ratio between the actual volume to encom-

passing rectangular (extruded rectangular).

                        Cb = V0                                                 (2.5)
                               Dbs

Cb is used for application and regulations of vessels. The coefficient indicates how
"smooth" the ship is. The ship displacing volume is denoted V0 and is defined as

                        V0 = Cb D b s                                           (2.6)

Another relic from the past is the Prismatic Coefficient which is the ratio of

                        Cp = V0                                                 (2.7)
                               s Am

This coefficient represents the width of the ship if the mid-section was expended to
full length of the ship. Notice that the shape encompassing the ship is not rectangular.
The Maximum Sectional Area Coefficient is defined as

                        Cm = Am                                                 (2.8)

Example 2.1: Cd calculations                               Level: Easy

A general cargo ship has a dead weight of 50k tonnes. Estimate the fully loaded
displacement (W).

Solution

The value of Cd is given the table 2.1 is 0.7. Hence, the displacement is

   Displacement = Light Displacement                                       (2.1.a)
                                     Cd

Applying the data to the equation Eq. (2.1.a)

   Displacement = 50000  71428.6 [tonnes]                                  (2.1.b)
                            0.7

Basically, the ship can carry about 21,428 [tonnes].

The bilge region is at the bottom and there areseveral definitions for it.

                        Fig. 2.2 - Ship Coordinates System suggested by DIN 81209-1.

Strangely there is a recommendation for coordinate system. However there is differences
between the various standards. For example, ISO 7460 and 7463 defined different origin
as compare to DIN 81209-1. In this book, this recommendation is not followed because
it it does not compatible with presentation of the material. The concept of the system
used by the context. It is assumed that this principle foreign to these who write the
standards. For example, in two dimensions, it is convenient to use x, y coordinate while
in three dimensions is should be x, z. This kind of system is adapted in this book.

       General coordinate system is attached to the floating body or ship. So, ship with
fixed z-coordinate fixed to liquid z-coordinate is referred to as upright condition. A
rotation of the z y plain are referred as heel or roll depending on the variance with
time. Even keel is referred to the situation in which x-coordinate is parallel to the liquid
level. Nautical terminology depreciates pitch and trim (see Fig. 8.3).

Fig. 2.4 - Trim in two possibilities which are to opposite of each other. The trim is results
     from unbalance loading more on stern or the bow.

Ideally ship and other floating bodies are designed to move relative to "center" coordi-
nate system. A deviation from the "center" coordinate exist and increase the resistance
to the flow and increase the cost operation. For example, the trim is pitch rotation to
new stability point. The trim is defined positive when the ship bow is up and referred
as trimmed by the head. The trim is the deviation from symmetry of the ship which
desired in certain situations ( like speedboat) more often is a problem.

       The ship's list is deviation form "zero" of the rolling movement. This change is
static. There is a dynamic component what have the zigzag movement which is results
from the non-symmetrical ship design and it is different from the ship's list. There is
another deviation that is not very common or significant is referred as deviation offset.
As oppose to the zigzag in the list direction the deviation is more important and this
author estimate that ship because this movement travel additional 2% of the total road
or more. This occur as the other zigzag because symmetry considerations and waves.
This 2% additonal road means additional 2% in fuel cost.

2.1.5 Ship Length

While this books does not deal with ship design several points has to mention about
ship's dimensions. The ship width is limited by the cost and the space available (canal
limitations). The ship length is determined by cost and need but limited by space at
designated ports. In same way the draft (depth) depends on the limited space with the
exception of the large tanker which can load and unload outside the port.

       The measuring how much ship is way from the "box" shape is

                                     CM = AM                                           (2.9)

The center cross section is referred as midship-section CM is referred as midship coef-
ficient. The compactness of ship is defined as

2.1.6 Ship Length

The design of the ship/boat is art more than science as indication shown that a new
design is based on the old and tested design rather design totally from fresh. yet, some
engineering principles can be utilized. The displacement is related to the ship length.
Yet, ships especially smaller one heaving a complex shape which the relationship has to
account for these effects.

s  3 V0 ----- s = f (   ) 3 V0    (2.12)

The logical assumption is that the correction factor which is related to deviation fac-
tors from the extruded rectangular. These deviation factors Cb, CM , CP were defined
earlier. The value of these is given by experience and no science but black art is used.

Notice that in these calculations the actual ship width and the ship depth are unknown.
The relationship The ratio of the length, s/b is determined from the requirement on
the resistance to the flow (ship speed). The ratio of b/D is dictated by the stability
consideration (more this issue in the book). With deviation factors given above the
length of a ship can be estimated for given dead weight, DW (which related to V0) as

s = 3 DW f (Cb, CD)                  (2.13)
          g

There are several formulas suggested in the literature. No information on the scientific
nature of the development of these equations was provided and hence none can be
recommended. An example of such formula is

      3 DW s 2 b                     (2.14)

       A dimensionless parameter known as Froude Displacement Coefficient to measure
the stretchiness (resistance to the flow) of the vessel and is

Froude number The Froude is range from 17 for racing boat, racing yacht 7, container
ship about 6.5 and Seventeenth-century first rate of 4. Beside this Froude number there
additional numbers have similar name and such example of definition is

       Heaving is a vertical movement of the ship. Sway is the linear movement in the
y direction. Surge is the linear movement in the x direction. If the body is symmetrical
than these movements do not affect each other (and also the other rotations). How-
ever, if the body is not a symmetrical they affect each other. Furthermore, all these
moments creates all the rotational moments. The base for the interaction between
these movements is clear but the calculation is beyond scope of this book. Estimate
this author done on this effect show that it about percent of order of magnitude. While
this number sound insignificant, in real life this can be a significant amount.

the ship floor is referred as "bilge."
The bilge exist for the several reasons,

like collection the water (or liquids), strength, and etc. The other curvature surfaces
are created for structural reasons. However, the flare can help with the stability.

2.3 Summary

This chapter deals with topics related to ship structure and design. For example,
different ships were introduced and various international standards discussed. These
definitions are indirectly related to ship stability. This discussion was add to the book
because there was a demand for it. Moreover, the main usage of the stability is for the
marine industry. Some of the material related to dimensional analysis but it is covered
because the dimensionless aspects are not the main issue.
y3 The Mathematical Background for Stability

In this chapter is review for most readers and new for others and intend to cover
minimum topics related to stability of floating body. These topics are present so that one
with some background in trigonometry could deal with the mathematics that encompass
in this book. Hence without additional reading, this book could be used by most readers.

3.1 Differentiation

What is differentiation and why it is important? In trigonometric there is a function
call tangent for short tan, that reader should know, the ratio the sides of triangle. A
parabolic function shown Fig. 3.1 has a point x, x2 denoted by the red point. To find
the tangent to the function a triangle is build starting at red point. The second point is
at (x + x, x2) and the third is on the graph vertically from second point denoted by
green point. Clearly the line connecting the second and third point is above the graph
(the purple point). To minimize the distance between the purple line (see the figure)

                                                     f (x) = x2

                                                                                             

                                                                x

18                           CHAPTER 3. MATHEMATICS FOR STABILITY

and the graph, the triangle has to shrink. The tangent of the angle of the triangle at it

is
                                               tan  = y
                                                         x

The value of y an be ascertained the difference between the function value at x and

x + x as  y = f (x + x) - f (x) = (x + x)2 - x2

The first term on right hand side can be expand as

          y = dxd2 + 2 x x + (x)2 - dxd2 = 2 x x + (x)2

The tangent in this case is

                               tan  = 2 x x + (x)2 = 2 x + x
                                                 x

When x become smaller and smaller (about zero) the value of the tangent is 2x.
This example of differentiation explains the concept and it has been extend. In this
book the concept was explained and other derivative of other functions should obtained
from table or other sources. There is no need to emphasis here. The reason that
differentiation is extremely important because almost all the calculations in stability
requires understanding this concept. Ultimately, most of the calculations ended to
simple arithmetic. The derivative are denote as dy/dx and they are actually tan .

          tan  = y = f (x + x) - f (x)                                            (3.1)
                             x                              x

The tangent can be used to evaluate the at some distance from point x as

                                                                            tan   (3.2)

                             f (x + x)  f (x) + x dy
                                                              dx

It must be note that a short notation of derivative is f (x) or even shorter hand is
simply f .

3.2 Integration

The integration is calculation of the area under the curve. The area is made of many
trapezoids as shown in Fig. 3.2. Without any proof but simply using the intuition
integration is opposite of differentiation. The explain to that is based on the following.
Note the explanation is not rigorous but just the underline. The integration is denoted
by the symbol . For example, the function (F) can be defined as

                                                                                x

                                           F (x) = f (t)dt

                                                                              0

In this case, the notation of dt and t is just a dummy variable and the integral from
point 0 to point x. Integration is done by adding small rectangular shape thus,

                                                             x f (x)

                                       x                  x+x

              F (x + x) = f (t)dt +                            f (t)dt                           (3.3)

                                    0        x

For small distance of x the value of the function is constant. Hence, the second
integral can be written as over the brace was the width and height given.

function is done by "guessing." For example, it was

found before that the derivative of x2 is 2x. Hence, the integral of 2x is x2.

This a brief introduction to calculus and no mean it meat to be complete and

comprehensive. Yet, the reader should be able to understand some of the mathematical

explanation.

3.3 Vectors and Coordinates System

The are many coordinate systems which are used to describe location or direction. In this
book two systems will be discussed, Cartesian, Cylindrical coordinate. The Cartesian
system describes the location with three linear coordinate normally call, x, y, z. The
20                                  CHAPTER 3. MATHEMATICS FOR STABILITY

Cylindrical coordinate measures with a distance from the center on the plane and the
angle and z.

       Vector is a quantity with direction as oppose to scalar. The length of the vector
in Cartesian coordinates (the coordinates system is relevant) is

        U = Ux2 + Uy2 + Uz2                         (3.6)

 Vector can be normalized and in Cartesian coordinates depicted in Figure 3.3 where

Ux is the vector component in the x direction, Uy is the vector component in the y
direction, and Uz is the vector component in the z direction. Thus, the unit vector is

    U=     U                        Ux ^ Uy ^ Uz ^
              = i+ j+ k                             (3.7)
           U                           U  U  U

and general orthogonal coordinates

    U = U = U1 h1 + U2 h2 + U3 h3                   (3.8)
        U                           U     U  U

       Vectors have some what similar rules to scalars which will be discussed in the next
section.

3.3.1 Vector Algebra

Vectors obey several standard mathematical operations which are applicable to scalars.
The following are vectors, U , V , and W and for in this discussion a and b are scalars.
Then the following can be said

   1. (U + V ) + W = (U + V + W ) = U + (V + W )

   2. U + V = V + U

   3. Zero vector is such that U + 0 = U

   4. Additive inverse U - U = 0

   5. a (U + V ) = a U + a V

   6. a (b U ) = a b U
3.3. VECTORS AND COORDINATES SYSTEM                                              21

       The multiplications and the divisions have                     W
somewhat different meaning in a scalar operations.                            V
There are two kinds of multiplications for vectors.
The first multiplication is the "dot" product which                           U
is defined by equation (3.9). The results of this mul-
tiplication is scalar but has no negative value as in
regular scalar multiplication.

                                         vectors                 sults in W .
U  V = |U |  |V |
                                cos ((U , V ))    (3.9)

       The second multiplication is the "cross" product which in vector as opposed to
a scalar as in the "dot" product. The "cross" product is defined in an orthogonal

coordinate (h1, h2, and h3) as

                                                     angle

                                U  V = |U |  |V | sin ((U , V )) n             (3.10)

where  is the angle between U and V , and n is a unit vector perpendicular to both U
and V which obeys the right hand rule. The right hand rule is referred to the direction
of resulting vector. Note that U and V are not necessarily orthogonal. Additionally
note that order of multiplication is significant. This multiplication has a negative value
which means that it is a change of the direction.

       One of the consequence of this definitions in Cartesian coordinates is

                                i2 = j2 = k2 = 0                                 (3.11)

In general for orthogonal coordinates this condition is written as

                                              2   2      2
                                h1  h1 = h1 = h2 = h3 = 0                       (3.12)

where hi is the unit vector in the orthogonal system.
      In right hand orthogonal coordinate system

                                h1  h2 = h3      h2  h1 = -h3                  (3.13)
                                h2  h3 = h1      h3  h2 = -h1
                                h3  h1 = h2      h1  h3 = -h2

The "cross" product can be written as

U  V = (U2 V3 - U3 V2) h1 + (U3 V1 - U1 V3) h2 + (U1 V2 - U2 V1) h3             (3.14)
                                                                                 (3.15)
Equation (3.14) in matrix form as

                                                  h1 h2 h3  

                                U  V =  U2 U2 U3

22    CHAPTER 3. MATHEMATICS FOR STABILITY

       The most complex of all these algebraic operations is the division. The multipli-
cation in vector world have two definition one which results in a scalar and one which
results in a vector. Multiplication combinations shows that there are at least four pos-
sibilities of combining the angle with scalar and vector. The reason that these current
combinations, that is scalar associated with cos  vectors is associated with sin , is
that these combinations have physical meaning. The previous experience is that help
to define multiplication help to definition the division. The number of the possible
combinations of the division is very large. For example, the result of the division can
be a scalar combined or associated with the angle (with cos or sin), or vector with the
angle, etc. However, these above four combinations are not the only possibilities (not
including the left hand system). It turn out that these combinations have very little1
physical meaning. Additional possibility is that every combination of one vector element
is divided by the other vector element. Since every vector element has three possible
elements the total combination is 9 = 3  3. There at least are two possibilities how
to treat these elements. It turned out that combination of three vectors has a physical
meaning. The three vectors have a need for additional notation such of vector of vector
which is referred to as a tensor. The following combination is commonly suggested

                                                     

     U1    U2                                    U3

3.3.2 Cylindrical Coordinates

The cylindrical coordinates are commonality used in situations where there is line of

symmetry or kind of symmetry. This kind situations occur in pipe flow even if the pipe

is not exactly symmetrical. These coordinates reduced the work, in most cases, because

problem is reduced a two dimensions. Historically, these coordinate were introduced for
geometrical problems about 2000 years ago2. The cylindrical coordinates are shown in
Figure 3.5. In the figure shows that the coordinates are r, , and z. Note that unite
coordinates are denoted as r, , and z. The meaning of -r and r are different. The first
one represents the vector that is the direction of r while the second is the unit vector
in the direction of the coordinate r. These three different rs are some what similar
to any of the Cartesian coordinate. The second coordinate  has unite coordinate .
The new concept here is the length factor. The coordinate  is angle. In this book the
dimensional chapter shows that in physics that derivatives have to have same units in

order to compare them or use them. Conversation of the angel to units of length is
done by length factor which is, in this case, r. The conversion between the Cartesian
coordinate and the Cylindrical is

r = x2 + y2                     = arctan y           z=z        (3.17)
                                             x

The reverse transformation is

x = r cos                      y = r sin             z=z        (3.18)

The line element and volume element are

3.4 Numerical Analysis

The integration and the derivation sometimes cannot or hard to perform. In fact,
the first integration method was introduced by the father of modern, Bouguer, Pierre
namely the trapezoid method. First, the differentiation will be introduced3. The concept
numerical differentiation is direct as

                               y  y2 - y1 = y2 - y1             (3.20)

cylindrical (polar) coordinates in description of geometry or location relative to a center point.

    3It hard to discuss intelligently the issue of differentiation without understanding Taylor series.
Taylor series will be presented hopefully in the next version. It is assumed that that they are known to
the reader.
24                  CHAPTER 3. MATHEMATICS FOR STABILITY

This method is called a forward differentiation or one-sided differentiation. The similar
methods is backward differentiation is

                 y  y1 - y0 = y1 - y0                        (3.21)
                 x x1 - x0          x

If the distance between the point is uniform then improvements can be made. Another
approach is the take the two sides which sometimes referred to as centered differentiation

                 y  y2 - y0 = y2 - y0                        (3.22)
                 x x2 - x0 2 x

This equation is more precise under certain or even (most) certain circumstance.

         is much better technique than these methods.

       Integration is calculating the area under the "graph." The simplest method is
left or right rectangular which is basically the value of the function (data point) times

Deltax. Better technique was invented by Bouguer, Pierre. In this methods it is
assumed that the area can be calculated by a trapezoid. For practical purpose if distance
between the data points is equal, the calculation is

                     A = y0 + yn n-1 + yi x                              (3.23)
                                  2 i=1

3.6 Simpson's Rule

A better method is what is called Simpson Rule and it should be called Kepler rule.
The idea behind that methods is that the function can be represented by parabola so it
close the actual function. In this case the area is even equal parts (intervals) because
the nature of the method.

       Simpson's Rule is just a tool and the derivation can be found on numerous places.
However, actual procedure is presented here. For example if the interval is split into
two sub intervals than the equation is

                     Area = (2 x) yo + 4 y1 + y2
                                                   6

The minimal larger influence on the results. Simpson's rule gives you the following
estimate for the area under the curve:

Area = (2 x) 1 [(yo + 4y1 + y2) + (y2 + 4y3 + y4) +    + (   yn)]  (3.24)
                      6

We can combine terms here by exploiting the following pattern in the coefficients:

   Solution

For n = 4 subintervals, Simpsons rule is reduced into

             A = x [y(0) + 4 y(1) + 2 y (x2) + 4 y (x3) + y (x4)]

3.7 Summary

Mathematics is the language of science. It is hard to see how one can understand
concept as stability without knowledge of calculus. While the mathematics in stability
does not expand to two dimensions or even three dimensions. In the chapter dealing
moment of inertia and centroid of area or volume or mass requires knowledge integration.
This author experience was such that once intro was given and taken seriously the
material could be understood. Mathematics is only the tool and not core what this
book is focus on.
       4 Mass Centroid

The mass (or gravity) centroid is divided into two sections, first, the mass centroid and
two, area centroid (two-dimensional body with equal distribution mass). Additionally,
the change of center of mass due to addition or subtraction of mass plus discrete areas
are presented. The reason for the last addition, is that explain core explanation of the
stability analysis.

4.1 Actual Mass Centroid

In many engineering problems, the knowledge of mass centroid is required to make the
calculations especially for stability. This concept is derived from the fact that a body
has a centroid (mass/gravity) which interacts with other bodies and that this force
acts on the center (equivalent force)1. It turns out that this concept is very useful in
calculating rotations, moment of inertia, etc. The mass centroid doesn't depend on the
coordinate system and on the way it is calculated. The physical meaning of the mass
centroid is that if a straight line force acts on the body in away through the center of
gravity, the body will not rotate. In other words, if a body will be held by one point it
will be enough to hold the body in the direction of the mass centroid. Note, if the body
isn't be held through the mass centroid, then a moment, in additional to the force, is
required (to prevent the body for rotating). It is convenient to use the Cartesian system
to explain this concept. Suppose that the body has a distribution of the mass (density,
) as a function of the location. The density "normally" defined as mass per volume.

    1(Lautrup 2011) has suggested when a body is long this statement needs corrections in variable
gravity field. To encourage participation of students, it is suggested here small projects. If you a
student or someone how interested in the field, and like your name mentioned, contact this author for
a project discussion.

In x coordinate, the center will be defined as

       ,x = 1                dm                                                          (4.1)

Here, the dV element has finite dimensions in y-z plane and infinitesimal dimension in
x direction see Figure 4.1. Also, the mass, m is the total mass of the object. It can be
noticed that center of mass in the x-direction isn't affected by the distribution in the
y nor by z directions. In same fashion the center of mass can be defined in the other
directions as following

         xi of Center Mass                                                               (4.2)
       x칒 = 1 xi (xi)dV

              mV

where xi is the direction of either, x, y or z. The density, (xi) is the line density as
function of xi. Thus, even for solid and uniform density the line density is a function of
the geometry. When finite masses are combine the total mass Eq. (4.2) converted into

       x = xi mi                                                                        (4.3)

body can be approximated as a two-dimensional shape        y

sity. Consider a uniform thin body with a constant thick-         z
ness shown in Figure 4.2 which has density, . Thus,                                  x

when the integral now is over only the area as oppose over the volume. Eq. (4.5) can
also be written for discrete areas as

area in this context is subtraction of area.

new centroid marked "n" and area removed                on

"r" and area added "a." This section deals

with a change centroid location when an

area is add or subtracted from a given area

with a know centroid (or unknown). This          Fig. 4.3 - Solid body with removed and

was found or previously calculated and

hence only change needed. Furthermore, for some problems, the change or its direction

has more importance as it will be discussed in greater detail in, chapter on stability of

floating bodies on page 89. The centroid of body in Fig. 4.3 is denoted at point "o"

(old). The centroid of the added and removed areas are at points "a" (added) and "r"

(removed), respectively. The point "n" (new) is the centroid after modification. A

special case when the added area is equal to the subtracted area and its application

will be discussed in an example below. It has to be noted that added and subtracted

areas do not have to be continuous. Utilizing Eq. (4.6) for the identical areas reads for

this case as

              xn = xo Ao + xr Ar - xa Aa                       (4.7)
                           Ao + Ar - Aa

In a special case where subtracted area is equal to added area (Ar = Aa) Eq. (4.7) is
reduced to

              xn = xo + xr Ar - xa Aa                          (4.8)

Finding the centroid location should be done in the most convenient coordinate system
since the location is coordinate independent. There should be a sign convention to
determine the centroid direction movement so that the direction should be immedi-
ately expressed in the result. However, faults were found in several options that were
considered2.

Example 4.2: Center of Circle inside Circle       Level: Easy

A circle with a radius, r has a cut out               rR
from a larger circle with radius, R where
R > r (see Fig. 4.4). The distance be-                     x
tween the center of the larger circle and
the small circle is x. Calculate the cen-     Fig. 4.4 - Subtraction of circle from
troid of the circle that a smaller circle          a large circle for calculating the
was cut out of it. Assume that x is                new center.
small enough so that the small circle is

whole.

Solution

The change in the centroid is only the direction of x. It should be noted that for
x = 0, the centroid is at x = 0 and y = 0 that is the centroid is at the center of the
larger circle. For larger distance up to the x = R - r the centroid can be calculated
utilizing Eq. (4.7) reads

          r2                                  r2                                      (4.2.a)
x =  2 (x - 0) = x                           R

         R

 Notice that x is the distance between the two centers while x is the change in the
centroid location. Additionally, if the removed circle is not on the x coordinate then
these calculations can be reused. For instance, if the cut is at angle, , the change
will be along straight line from the center of the large circle at the distance that was

obtained in Eq. (4.2.a). The conversion to a regular coordinate system could be done

by utilizing simple trigonometric functions.

    In some situations a rectangle shape is    b/2 tan   Y b          1
    transferred to a trapezoid shape while
    the area size remain constant. For ex-                    2 cos        d
    ample, a body floating (in liquid) has a                 b/2
    rectangle shape. Rotation (hypothetical                             X
    or real) of the floating body will result              2
    in a change to a trapezoid. This situa-
    tion is used to check whether a body is                     b
    stable. Assume that the rectangle body

    x directions, the total change, and the
    angle of change . Note that  is mea-
    sured from point (b/2,d).

    Solution

    The rectangular centroid is located at b/2, d/2 (see table 4.2). The two triangles
    must be identical to keep the condition of constant area. It also implies that two
    triangles must start from the same point at the "center" (point x = b/2 and y = d
    to be denoted Point A). Eq. (4.9) dictates that the change is due to the addition and
    subtraction of the triangles. The change can be expressed as

     (Ai yi) =           y2          A

Note that for small angle   tan  therefore  >> 2 and hence, x >> y. The
total change r can expressed as a function of y and x to read

The angle is measured from a specific

point. In this case the point is the connec-

tion between the two triangles. The reason

for this selection is that this point will be                      
used in stability issue. It can be noticed

It is interesting to point out that the  is related to the ratio of d/b and to the
rotating angle, . For small angle, tan  =  and d/b  1/8 (or even smaller)

Eq. (4.3.k) becomes

 2 tan  2

Thus under the condition of (b/d)2 = 6, the change in  is equal . This is a limiting
case which determines in certain situations whether a floating body is stable and it
will be discussed in Chapter 8 on page 89.

The triangle ROQ is an isosceles triangle with 45. The angle RR"O is (180 -

sin(135 - ) according the trigonometry identies equal to (sin  + cos )/2 and for

        The distance OR = b/ 2 (It can be verified by looking at the isosceles triangle

The distance C C = 2/3R R . Hence, C C = 2 b sin /3. The line R O split the

4.4 Change of Mass Centroid Due to Addition or Subtraction

      of Mass in 3D

This topic is extension of the previous topic of two dimensions change of centroid.
All bodies are three dimensions thus when no symmetry or extrudation3 exist the full
analysis has to be done. Furthermore, it is interesting to point to the phenomenon none
symmetrical body the change and be in a third dimension. This topic to be discussed
in stability Chapter.

       A centroid of a slob is located in point "o" and additional mass depicted as "a"
and the removed/subtracted mass "r" and again the new location of centroid is denoted
as "n."

      xn = mo xo + ma xa - mr xr                                        (4.10)
                   mo - ma + mr

As before the special case of equal subtracted and added material Eq. (4.10) converted
into

                            xn = mo xo + m (xa - xr)                    (4.11)
                                               mo

that is expanded vertically.

                                                                   with added wedge and subtracted
                                                                   wedge.

    Solution

    First the centroid of the wedge has to be calculated and Eq. (4.2) can be used as

                                            xi =      xi dV                                     (4.5.a)
                                                       dV

    The ratio shown in Eq. (4.12) indicates that it is sufficient to ascertain over only half
    of wedge. The centroid of mass of cylinder wedge is not given in any table in this
    book and is not readily available other places. Hence, this work will be presented (a
    bit more than what should be presented in this book.). The volume of the wedge is

                                                              r                                 (4.5.b)

                                            V = 2 A dx

                                                            0

    Notice that instead to carry the integration from r to -r it is carried from 0 to r

    and  multiplied  by  two.  The  circle  equation  is  x2  + y2  =  r2.  The  infinitesimal  volume
                                                                       
    made from the triangle (the brown color) with a base of r2 - x2 and the height of
    r2 - x2 tan  and infinitesimal thickness, dx, to be integrated as

                                        A

                     V = 2       r r2 - x2 tan                        r                        (4.5.c)

    A new variable is defined as  = x/r when x = r -  = 1, and equation Eq. (4.5.c)
    can be transformed

     The brown triangle with infinitesimal thickness has mass centroid at 2/3 of the length
     of the triangle (from the center or in other words cylinder center). The mass centroid
     can be calculated utilizing the similar approach but simpler in cylindrical coordinates
     with the boundaries of zero to /2. The integration of infinitesimal volume (similar
     to previous calculations where the base is r cos ) can be carried as

                                  yi                 A

      xi dV = 2 /2 e2 r cos  (r cos )2 tan  dx cos  r d                      (4.5.e)

                   0          3                      e2

The choice of the coordinate system base on convenience. Eq. (4.5.e) can be written

as                                  2 r4 tan         /2
                        xi dV =

                                                  0

The integral is readily available and can be done by integration by part as

    xi dV =  2 r4 tan

The first and the second terms vanished at the boundaries. Substituting the volumes
of both integrals into Eq. (4.5.a) provides

                                     r4  tan                                 (4.5.h)

4.4.1 A Small Change in Angle of Rotation

This section is dealing with a special topic of change of area due to rotation when the
area (volume) is constant topic very is important to stability analysis. The change of
the area in Ex. 4.5 dealt with a specific geometry. This procedure can be generalized
or even simplified the procedure. The process of calculating the change of the centroid
can be converted for small angle.

                                          h

                 xi =      x dV =      x x tan  dA = tan  x2 dA     (4.13)
                            dV            V                  V

The term in the nominator is called the Moment of Inertia and will be discussed in the
following section. The Moment of Inertia symbolized by Ixx and Eq. (4.13) by

                                       xi = tan  Ixx                (4.14)
                                                  V

Notice that Ixx is a function of the cross section only and is half of the cross section.
Hence for the total moment of inertia double the half (see next section for explanation).
The volume of the small wedge is calculated below. The total change is defined in
Eq. (4.12)

                                        x due to change in 

                                                                          2 x1

                           x = V tan  Ixx = tan  Ixx                (4.15)

                                   V0 V                  V0

It is remarkable that the change location of centroid can be determined from know-
ing/calculating the moment of inertia of the cross section and by the displaced volume.

       The change in centroid in the y direction and done in a similar fashion when
noticing that the y is actually y/2 (when first y refers to the y of the distance and the
second refers to its value.). For small angle it can be written that

                              dV

              y dV         y/2 y dA (tan  x)2 dA tan2  x2 dA
    yi =                =              =              =             (4.16)
              V            V                 2V                 2V
4.4. CHANGE OF MASS CENTROID DUE TO ADDITION OR SUBTRACTION OF MASS IN 3D41

Again as in the x direction Eq. (4.17) moment of inertia should be recognized and it
can be written as

          y tan2  I i = xx               (4.17)
                    2V

Hence,

          y due to change in

          y = V tan2  Ixx = tan2  Ixx    (4.18)

The difference between in the two changes is significant. The amount change in y
smaller by a factor. For practical purposes, the change in y can be ignored.

As long as the geometry remains the same this analysis can be assumed to be correct.

Also note to that the  and  are diffident angle:  is the angle that is as location
for which is checked to see if it is stable, while  is the small angle forced on the
body to see the body will remain at . Fig. 4.11 depicts the liquid surface plane
(the blue color). The question refers two edge cases, one when  = 0 and two when
 = 45. Thus, the solution here will deals with all the angles. So all the properties
have to express as a function of angle . The volume is constant regardless to . The
moments inertia is a strong of . The distance bb shown in the figure is

                                        bb = b                       (4.7.a)
                                               cos 

Hence, the moment of inertia is

                                          b   3
                                        cos

                                                     12 cos 3

The volume of the body is

                                        V = dbs                      (4.7.c)

The change in buoyancy centroid Eq. (4.15) is

                                                  b2                 (4.7.d)

                              es b3
             x = tan  12 cos3  d b ---- x = es b d 12 cos3 b tan  

The two cases in the question are  = 0 and  = 45 can be substituted into

Eq. (4.7.d) to get the answers which are plotted on Fig. 4.12. The graph depict

Eq. (4.7.d) for the dimensionless parameters, angle of inclination, , and ratio of the

moment of inertia to the volume (below). The results show that as the inclination

angle, , has a dramatic effect. For large angle (30-40) the change in centroid

getting larger and larger. Additionally, larger value of b/d (width and depth) ratio

the effect become more significant. In the case of  = 0 and  = 45 the equations

respectively are: 0 case;

                                      x = b tan                      (4.7.e)

The distance AB is d/2 thus tangent  is

     tan  = x = d 12 ----  = tan-1 1 b 2 tan

It can be observed from the analysis the change of x varies and this will be used in the
stability analysis. There several conclusions that can be drawn so far. As long geometry
remain the same, larger change on centroid appear for larger angle. When happen when
the change of number of angle appear. In other words, if the surface reaches to upper
or the lower corner then the analysis has to be modified.

Example 4.8: Ellipse centroid                                    Level: Intermediate

Repeat Ex. 4.7 for cylinder standing up. Cross section area is ellipse with minor

axis of D while the major radius changes and is function of the geometrical
identity as rm = r/cos. Using this information construct a map similar to the
above example.

Solution

The moment of inertia of the ellipse (see table 4.2) is

                   r           3

     The volume, again, is constant and equable to                   End of Ex. 4.8

                               V =  r2 d                                     (4.8.b)

The change in centroid is

                                                                         r2  (4.8.c)

Remark

The difference between this Eq. (4.8.c) and Eq. (4.7.d) is the coefficient.

Generally the change in centroid for extruded shape will be in a general form of

x  = CC                    geometrical parameter tan                         (4.19)

b                          geometrical parameter cos 3

Where CC is a coefficient that depend on the geometry. This form change when the
shape of the body is radially diffident. Large ships can be considered as a large box with
a round bottom. Thus the analysis provide here in relevant to these bodies close to
"boxes." However, for small boat have more complicate shape and it can be numerically
analyzed. It also can be noticed that bodies that change shape with z coordinate like
cone the centroid change as well as the center of the surface area (at liquid surface).

4.5 Transformation of Coordinates

Sometimes the information on the centroid is provided in different coordinate system.
In this case a demonstration on how to transfer the coordinate is present. A trapezoid
centroid are given normally in coordinate system that attached to base as shown below.

The ratio of C is related to Cx by  through the equation above and and the same
can said for the other pair (Cy, C). Assume that  is rotating at a constant angular
speed then the centroid is rotating but in different angular velocity. This fact means

that the centroid will not be under the point G or even A. The results are depicted in

It can be noted that for small value b/d the distance increases which is very important
factor for instability.

4.6 Appendix

As a side kick, the integral that was canceled before Eq. (4.15) can be calculated as
following

               dV = x tan dA = tan  x dA = tan x A                                      (4.23)

The value of tan  is constant in the integration and the value x is the average height
of wedge. The value of x is a function of  but not its location and the A cross area is
not function of . Sometime of values x are tabulated and hence the integration can
be readily available.

                                5 Moment of Inertia

As the Chapter 4 on the centroid was divided, the chapter on moment of inertia is divided
into moment of inertia of mass and area. Additionally this chapter another issue that
is transformation to different coordinate systems (linear, rotational). Furthermore, the
product of inertia will be introduced.

5.1 Moment of Inertia for Mass

The moment of inertia turns out to be an essential part for the calculations of rotating
bodies and stability. Furthermore, it turns out that the moment of inertia has much
wider applicability and usefulness than one assumes initially. Moment of inertia of mass
is defined as

                                           Moment of Inertia

Irrm = r2dV                                                             (5.1)

                V

If the density is constant then equation (5.1) can be transformed into

Irrm =  r2 dV                                                           (5.2)

                   V

The moment of inertia is independent of the coordinate system used for the calculation,
but dependent on the location of axis of rotation relative to the body. Some people
define the radius of gyration as an equivalent concepts for the center of mass concept
and which means if all the mass were to locate in the one point/distance and to obtain

50                                         CHAPTER 5. MOMENT OF INERTIA

the same of moment of inertia.

                                   rk = Im                                                               (5.3)
                                             m

The body has a different moment of inertia for every coordinate/axis and they are

    Ixx =                       V rx2dm =  V (y2 + z2) dm                                                (5.4)
    Iyy =                       V ry2dm =  V (x2 + z2) dm
    Izz =                       V rz2dm =  V (x2 + y2) dm

    Ixx = V rx2dm = V (y2 + z2) dm

    Iyy = V ry2dm = V (x2 + z2) dm                                                                       (5.5)

    Izz = V rz2dm = V (x2 + y2) dm

5.2 Moment of Inertia for Area

5.2.1 General Discussion

For body with thickness, t and uniform density the following can be written

                                                                                        moment of iner-
                                                                                        tia for area

    Ixxm = r2dm =  t                              r2dA                                                   (5.6)
                                                                                                         (5.7)
                     m                          A

The moment of inertia about axis is x can be defined as

                                   Moment of Inertia

                                Ixx = r2dA = Ixxm
                                                t
                                   A

where r is distance of dA from the axis x and t is the thickness. Any point distance
can be calculated from axis x as

                                   x = y2 + z2                                                           (5.8)

Thus, Eq. (5.7) can be written as

                                        Ixx = y2 + z2 dA                                                  (5.9)
                                                                                                         (5.10)
                                                                       A

In the same fashion for other two coordinates as

                                        Iyy = x2 + z2 dA

                                                                       A

                                Izz = x2 + y2 dA                                                         (5.11)

This section deals with transformation of
the moment of from one system to a par-

allel system. The moment is depended on y                 z        C y x
the coordinate system. The dependency is                    x
because moment of inertia changes when                          x
the body rotates in different coordinates.
The moment of inertial can be calculated

for any axis. The knowledge about one        Fig. 5.1 - The schematic that explains the sum-

inertia for a parallel axis. Ixx is denoted

as the moment of inertia about axis xx

which is at the center of mass/area. The moment of inertia for axis x is

Ix x = r 2dA = y 2 + z 2 dA = (y + y)2 + (z + z)2 dA                            (5.12)

A       A                                    A

Eq. (5.12) can be expended as

   Ixx                            =0

Ix x = y2 + z2 dA + 2 (y y + z z) dA + (y)2 + (z)2 dA (5.13)
A                              A                       A

       The first term in Eq. (5.13) on the right hand side is the moment of inertia about
axis x and the second them is zero. The second therm is zero because it integral of
center about center thus is zero. The third term is a new term and can be written as

        constant                                r2          A

       (y)2 + (z)2 dA = (y)2 + (z)                         2                    (5.14)

   A                                                         dA = r2 A

effects of this assumption. Calculate the moment of inertia about the center

    present in Fig. 5.6. I can be noticed that the error becomes significant very fast even

    for small values of t/a while the width of the box, b has no effect on the error.

    base is a and the height is h. What                                                 dy
    is the moment when a symmetrical tri-

    the moment inertia when h - 0?

    Solution

    The right wedge line equation can be calculated as

                                         y = 1- x
                                         h                   a

    or x y
                                                  a = 1- h

    Now using the moment of inertia of rectangle on the side (y) coordinate (see example

    5.2)

                                ha            y3        h
                                         1 - dy a3 h

    For two triangles attached to each other the moment of inertia will be sum as a3 h .
                                                                                                             2

5.5. PRODUCT OF INERTIA                                                 57

5.5 Product of Inertia

In addition to the moment of inertia, the product of inertia is commonly used. Here
only the product of the area is defined and discussed. The product of inertia defined as

                              Moment of Inertia                         (5.18)

                              Ixi xj = xi xj dA

                                               A

For example, the product of inertia for x and y axis is

                              Ixy = x ydA                               (5.19)

                                            A

       Product of inertia can be positive or negative value as oppose the moment of
inertia. The calculation of the product of inertia isn't different much for the calculation
of the moment of inertia. The units of the product of inertia are the same as for moment
of inertia.

5.5.1 Transfer of Axis Theorem

Same as for moment of inertia there is also similar theorem.

                   Ix y = x y dA = (x + x) (y + y)dA                    (5.20)

                           A                A

expanding equation (5.20) results in

                                         0           0

                      Ixy     y x dA x y dA                      x y A

                                      A           A

Ix y = x ydA + x ydA + x ydA + x ydA                                    (5.21)

                   A          A                A              A

The final form is

                                       Ix y = Ixy + x y A               (5.22)
There are several relationships should be mentioned

                                      Ixy = Iyx                         (5.23)

Symmetrical area has zero product of inertia because integration of odd function (asym-
metrical function) left part cancel the right part.

                         = y cos  - x sin                               (5.25)

Using these identities and writing by collecting all the right terms yields the following
relationship

               I = Ixx + Iyy + Ixx - Iyy cos 2 - Ixy sin 2              (5.26a)
                    2               2                                   (5.26b)
                                                                        (5.26c)
               I = Ixx + Iyy + Ixx - Iyy cos 2 + Ixy sin 2
                    2               2

                        I = Ixx - Iyy sin 2 + Ixy cos 2
                                     2

This Eq. (5.26) can be manipulated to show

                        I + I = Ixx + Iyy                               (5.27)

By differentiating the Eq. (5.26a) with respect to  and setting the result to zero to
obtain

               dI = -2  Ixx - Iyy                  sin 2 - 2 Ixy cos 2  (5.28)
                d            2

Thus, the maximum or minimum is at

                    tan 2principal = 2 Ixy                              (5.29)
                                          Iyy - Ixx

Using these results it can be shown that the maximum/minimum moment of inertia is

               Imax = Ixx + Iyy                   Ixx - Iyy  2         (5.30)

6.1 Introduction

The concept of pressure is very important in stability. As opposed to regular treatment
in Fluid Mechanics books or class, it will treated as a scalar and care will be given
to minimize the actual complex mathematical details. It is assumed that some of the
readers of this book lack the mathematical background, hence the complexity will be
abstracted.

       In simple terms, pressure is the ratio of force
and the area such as

P=F                               (6.1)                h
      A                                                      a

The force, F is a vector as well the area, A. So,

division of vector by vector creates a complex cre-

ation with nine (9) terms. However, here only one      Fig. 6.1 - Cylinder to explain the pres-
term is used since the pressure is equal in all three       sure concept.
directions and there no other terms (at no flow sit-

uations). Here, the pressure is assumed to be acting force magnitude divided by the area

in the same direction. When the "bureaucratic" formality is cleared, a simple pressure

explanation can be presented. A cylinder of liquid shown in the Fig. 6.1 the top is at

liquid surface and is weight

                                            V                   (6.2)

                              W =  a2 h  g

                                           A

                              61
62                                            CHAPTER 6. PRESSURE

The weight is the force that acting on the surface at the bottom of the cylinder. The
pressure at the surface according to the definition 6.1 is

              r ar2 h  g                      (6.3)
                 r2 = gh
                 ar

The pressure in stationary liquid is simply depends on the density and the height (and
the gravity). The pressure is not depends on the area.

       This concept that pressure depends solely on the depth of liquid is extended to the
fact that there is no need for it be in a continuous line. That is the pressure constant
pressure lines that goes where the liquid is connected. For example, in Fig. 6.2 depicts
constant pressure line across solid walls.

   Fig. 6.2 - Constant pressure lines across solid boundaries. It can be noticed that free surface
         are equal while the close could be higher.

In fact the this idea used in may places as way to measure two locations to be in the
same height.

6.2 Fluid Forces on Surfaces

The forces that fluids (at static conditions) extracts on surfaces are very important for
engineering purposes. This section deals with these calculations which are divided into
two categories, straight surfaces and curved surfaces. These issues especially applied to
floating bodies and ships.

6.2.1 Fluid Forces on Straight Surfaces

A motivation is needed before going through the routine of derivations. Initially, a
simple case will be examined. Later, how the calculations can be simplified will be
shown.

    Example 6.1: Pressure on Door             Level: Intermediate

    A straight vertical ship door is exposed to salt water at density of ws. The
    width of door is 1[m] and its length is 2[m] and door hinges are located at the

    surface of the water. The calculate the total force acted on the door and the

    moment the water acts on the door. If water was acting both sides of the door

    the net force and momentum is zero. Why?

                                                                   End of Ex. 6.1
   Solution

The pressure that acting on door varied from zero at the top (since it is at the water
surface) and maximum pressure at the bottom. To avoid using the mathematics the
two values can be taken and averaged and multiply to get the force. The pressure at
the bottom is  g h and the height is given the h and thus average pressure

                                    Pavg =  g h                                            (6.1.a)
                                                2

The total force will be

                          P                                                                (6.1.b)
                                                                                        A

             F =  g h A = 1000  9.8  2/2  2  1  19, 600[N ]
                      2

The force is incredible almost 20 tons. According to same logic the moment (assuming
that this concept is introduced somewhere else before) will be at the center and value
will be 20 ton  m. At this part a bit must be inserted and check against these
assumptions. It is regular procedure to take an very small element in which the
pressure is uniform and add these elements. The element chosen is an element dh
and the width of the door. The pressure in the element (a dh) is uniform since the
element depth is uniform. The element force is dF =  g h a dh and total force is

                         h F =  g h a dh =  g a h2                                         (6.1.c)

                                 0

which identical to what was computed using the average pressure. Note the integral

of h is h2/2. To find the point of equivalent force (that force substitute pressure)

                                        죇

The result is the center of triangle which is the shape of the pressure. So while the

pressure assumption was correct the center of pressure is at center of the triangle.

    Consider a rectangular shape gate as shown in Fig. 6.3. Calculate the mini-

    mum forces, F1 and F2 to maintain the gate in position. Assuming that the
    atmospheric pressure can be ignored.

    Solution

    The forces can be calculated by looking at the moment around point "O." The element
    of moment is a d for the width of the gate and is

                                                                                    dF                     (6.2.a)

                                             dM = P a d( + )

                                                                                       dA

    The pressure, P can be expressed as a function  as the following

              P = g  ( + )sin

    The liquid total moment on the gate is                                                                 (6.4)

                                                                   b

                                   M = g  ( + ) sin  a d( + )

                                                                 0

    The integral can be simplified as

                                                                                              b

                                       M = g a  sin  ( + )2d

                                                                                            0

    The solution of the above integral is

              M = g  a sin                  3 b l2 + 3 b2 l + b3
                                                      3

    This value provides the moment that F1 and F2 should extract. Additional equation
    is needed. It is the total force, which is

                                    b

              Ftotal = g  ( + ) sin  a d

                                  0

    The total force integration provides

                                                         b                                       2 b + b2
                                                                                                      2
              Ftotal = g  a sin  ( + )d = g  a sin 

                                                       0

    The forces on the gate have to provide

              F1 + F2 = g  a sin            2 b + b2
                                                 2

    Additionally, the moment of forces around point "O" is

              F1 + F2( + b) = g  a sin      3 b l2 + 3 b2 l + b3

kind of problems.

6.2.1.1 Symmetrical Shapes

Consider the two-dimensional symmetrical area that are under pressure as shown in
Figure 6.4. The symmetry is around any axes parallel to axis x. The total force and
moment that the liquid extracting on the area need to be calculated. First, the force is

F = P dA =          (Patmos +  g h)dA = A Patmos +  g                                  h()

           A                                                                1

                                                                             ( + 0) sin  dA (6.5)

                                                                          0

 In this case, the atmospheric pressure can include any additional liquid layer above
layer "touching" area. The "atmospheric" pressure can be set to zero.

       The boundaries of the integral of equation (6.5) refer to starting point and ending

                          My = Patmos xc A + g  sin Ix x

Example 6.2 can be generalized to solve any two forces needed to balance the area/-
gate. Consider the general symmetrical body shown in Fig. 6.5 which has two forces
that balance the body. Equations (6.7) and (6.11) can be combined the moment and
force acting on the general area. If the "atmospheric pressure" can be zero or include
additional layer of liquid. The forces balance reads

                    F1 + F2 = A [Patmos +  g sin  ( 0 + xc)]                       (6.12)

and moments balance reads

                           F1 a + F2 b = Patmos xc A + g  sin Ix x                 (6.13)

       In the solution, the forces can be negative or positive, and the distance a or b can
be positive or negative. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure can contain either an
additional liquid layer above the "touching" area or even atmospheric pressure simply
can be set up to zero. In symmetrical area only two forces are required since the moment
is one dimensional. However, in non-symmetrical area there are two different moments
and therefor three forces are required. Thus, additional equation is required. This
equation is for the additional moment around the x axis (see for explanation in Figure
6.6). The moment around the y axis is given by equation (6.11) and the total force is
given by (6.7). The moment around the x axis (which was arbitrary chosen) should be

                                            Mx = y P dA                         (6.16)

Substituting the components for the pressure transforms equation (6.16) into

                               Mx = y (Patmos +  g  sin ) dA                    (6.17)

The integral in equation (6.16) can be written as

                                    A yc       Ix y

                 Mx = Patmos y dA + g sin   y dA

moment) but no general solution is pro-                          x

     The three equations that needs to be solved are

                             F1 + F2 + F3 = Ftotal                                                      (6.3.a)

The moment around x axis is            F1 b = My                                                        (6.3.b)
The moment around y axis is

                          F1 1 + F2 (a + 0) + F3 0 = Mx                                                 (6.3.c)

The right hand side of these equations are given before in equations (6.7), (6.11) and

(6.19).
The moment of inertia of the triangle around x is made of two triangles (as shown in
the Figure (6.7) for triangle 1 and 2). Triangle 1 can be calculated as the moment of
inertia around its center which is 0 +2( 1 - 0)/3. The height of triangle 1 is ( 1 - 0)
and its width b and thus, moment of inertia about its center is Ixx = b( 1 - 0)3/36.
The moment of inertia for triangle 1 about y is

The height of the triangle 2 is a - ( 1 - 0) and its width b and thus, the moment of
inertia about its center is

                                                                  A2             x2 2

6.2.2 Pressure Center

In the literature, pressure centers are commonly defined. These definitions are mathe-
matical in nature and has physical meaning of equivalent force that will act through this
center. The definition is derived or obtained from equation (6.11) and equation (6.19).
The pressure center is the distance that will create the moment with the hydrostatic
force on point "O." Thus, the pressure center in the x direction is

                                          xp = 1 x P dA                       (6.20)
                                                  FA

In the same way, the pressure center in the y direction is defined as

                       yp = 1 y P dA                                          (6.21)
                              FA

To show relationship between the pressure center and the other properties, it can be
found by setting the atmospheric pressure and 0 to zero as following

                       xp = g  sin  Ix x                                      (6.22)
                              A  g sin  xc

Expanding Ix x according to equation (5.12) results in                        (6.23)
                                            xp = Ixx + xc
                                                    xc A

and in the same fashion in y direction

                       yp = Ixy + yc                                          (6.24)
                              yc A

It has to emphasis that these definitions are useful only for case where the atmospheric
pressure can be neglected or canceled and where 0 is zero. Thus, these limitations
diminish the usefulness of pressure center definitions. In fact, the reader can find that
direct calculations can sometimes simplify the problem.

6.3 Pressure on Floating Body

While the fundamentals of the pressure where dis-
cussed before it worth while to review with a typical
body like a block. The pressure around the block
has a shap of triangle. It can be noticed that pres-
sure on the front is identical to the pressure at the
back. Hence it cancel each other. The same can
be said for the right side and the left side. Similar
argument is made for diagonal surfaces. For diago-
nal surface the net force in any direction is just the
"shadow" in that direction times the pressure. The
pressure is the same in the same depth and hence Fig. 6.8 - Pressure on a floating block.
it cancel. The only side that pressure is not cancel
it the pressure on the bottom. The pressure is total (force = P A) in the weight of
the ship or the body. When the body is total immersed in the liquid, the force at the
bottom is reduced by the force at the top. The net force in the vertical direction, at
the stationary conditions, is the weight of the body.

6.4 Summary

The main points that this chapter was indent to illustrate are the following. Pressure
lines are constant depth form the surface. The pressure acting surfaces from both sides
has zero force and zero moment because there is a counter force and momentum. On
straight surfaces the forces are at 2/3 of the distance.

One of the oldest known scientific research on fluid mechanics relates to buoyancy due
to question of money was carried by Archimedes. Archimedes principle is related to
question of density and volume. While Archimedes did not know much about integrals,
he was able to capture the essence. Here, because this material is presented in a different
era, more advance mathematics will be used. While the question of the stability was
not scientifically examined in the past, the floating vessels structure (more than 300
years ago) show some understanding1.

       The total net forces the liquid and gravity exact on a body are considered as
a buoyancy issue while the moment these force considered as a stability issue. The
buoyancy issue was solved by Archimedes and for all practical purpose is really solved

    1This topic was the author's high school class name (ship stability). It was taught by people like
these, 300 years ago and more, ship builders who knew how to calculate G츼 but weren't aware of
scientific principles behind it. If the reader wonders why such a class is taught in a high school, perhaps
the name can explain it: Sea Officers High School ( or Acco (sometimes spell Akko) Nautical College)

oscillating of body is solved problem). While there are recent papers which deal the

issue but they do solve any issue in this respect. However, the rotation stability is issue

that continue to be evolved even after this work. There three approaches that deal with

issue which are in historical order are Metacenter, Potential, and Direct Examination2.

These stability issues will discussed in the next

several chapters.

    To understand this issue, consider a cubical

and a cylindrical body that is immersed in liquid and          h0

center in a depth of, h0 as shown in Fig. 7.1. The

force which hold the cylinder at the place made from                    r

the integration of the pressure around the surface of                   

the bodies. The forces on square geometry body are

made only of vertical forces because the two sides

cancel each other. However, on the vertical direc-

tion, the pressure on the two surfaces are different.  Fig. 7.2 - The floating forces on
                                                            Immersed Cylinder.
On the upper surface the pressure is  g (h0 - a/2).
On the lower surface the pressure is  g (h0 + a/2).

The force due to the liquid pressure per unit depth (into the page) is

    F =  g ((h0 - a/2) - (h0 + a/2)) b = - g a b = - g V                   (7.1)

In this case the represents a depth (into the page). Rearranging equation (7.1) to be

                   F =  g ----- F = V  g                                   (7.2)
                   V

 The force acting on the immersed body is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid.
This analysis can be generalized by noticing two things. All the horizontal forces are
canceled. Any body that has a projected area that has two sides, those will cancel each
other in the perpendicular to surface direction. Another way to look at this point is by
approximation. For any two rectangle bodies, the horizontal forces are canceling each
other. Thus, even these bodies are in contact with each other, the imaginary pressure
make it so that they cancel each other.

       On the other hand, any shape is made of many small rectangles. The force on
every rectangular shape is made of its weight of the volume. Thus, the total force is
made of the sum of all the small rectangles which is the weight of the sum of all volume.

       In illustration of this concept, consider the cylindrical shape in Figure 7.1. The
force per area (see Figure 7.2) is

                   P                               dAvertical

                   dF =  g (h0 - r sin ) sin  r d                          (7.3)

    2The first method was developed 300 years ago, the potential was developed about 30 years ago
and Direct Examination is present here for the first time.

The total force will be the integral of the equation (7.3)

                                                          2                    (7.4)

Rearranging equation (7.3) transforms it to

                                                                   2           (7.5)

The solution of equation (7.5) is

                           F = - r2  g                                         (7.6)

The negative sign indicate that the force acting upwards. While the horizontal force is

               Fv =        (h0 - r sin ) cos  d = 0                            (7.7)

7.2 Examples

Example 7.1: Floating Log                                             Level: Advance

To what depth will a long log with radius, r, a length, and density, s in liquid

as the solution.

Solution

This example actually deals with two dimensional problem. Archimedes formula reads

                           V s = V0                                   (7.1.a)

The equations for both volumes linearly depended on the length s as

                           A es s = A0 es                             (7.1.b)

where A0 is the area of the segment. The area of segment as a function of  is

                             r2 (2  - sin(2 ))                        (7.1.c)

where  is the angle measured from the bottom to the contact point between the
liquid surface and the circle and the center is at the center of the circle. Substituting
Eq. (7.1.c) into Eq. (7.1.b) results in

                r2  r2 (2  - sin(2 )) s =                             (7.1.d)

From practical point of view, this example is solved. Nevertheless, for the fun of the
math the sin  can be expanded in Taylor series as

                       2  s = (2 )3 - (2 )5 + (2 )7 + . . .                                                      (7.1.f )

where thickness is half the maximum, calcu-
late the pressure inside the container. The
container diameter is w. Assume that the
wall thickness is small compared with the
other dimensions (t << w and t << h).

Solution

The air mass in the container is

                                                                                 V air

                                                              RT

The mass of the container is

                                                             A

                  mcontainer =  w2 + 2  w h t s

The liquid amount enters into the cavity is such that the air pressure in the cavity
equals to the pressure at the interface (in the cavity). Note that for the maximum
thickness, the height, h1 has to be zero. Thus, the pressure at the interface can be
written as

                                              Pin = l g hin

On the other hand, the pressure at the interface from the air point of view (ideal gas

model) should be

                  Pin = 2 mair R T1
                            hin  w

                                                 V

Since the air mass didn't change and it is known, it can be inserted into the above

equation.

                                                                                                                

                       l g hin + Patmos = Pin =      w2 h Patmos R T1

floating is under vacuum condition, the following height can be expanded into

In this analysis the air temperature in the container immediately after insertion in
the liquid has different value from the final temperature. It is reasonable as the
first approximation to assume that the process is adiabatic and isentropic. Thus, the
temperature in the cavity immediately after the insertion is

                       F = V g l     - V g  l = V g l (1 - )

But on the other side the internal force is

                                                                                           m

                                          F = m a = V l a

Thus, the acceleration is

                                     a=g 1-
                                                  

If the object is left at rest (no movement) thus time will be (h = 1/2 a t2)

                                     t = 2 h

From the above equation, it can be observed that only the density ratio is important.
This idea can lead to experiment in "large gravity" because the acceleration can be
magnified and it is much more than the reverse of free falling.

In some situations, it is desired to find equivalent of force of a certain shape

to be replaced by another force of a "standard" shape. Consider the force that

acts on a half sphere. Find equivalent cylinder that has the same diameter that

has the same force.

Solution

The force act on the half sphere can be found by integrating the forces around the
sphere. The element force is

                                                                                                 dAx

The total force is then                                         End of Ex. 7.5

                           00

The result of the integration the force on sphere is

                                         F 2 ( s = L - S ) r3
                                                          4

The force on equivalent cylinder is

                               Fc =  r2 (L - S ) h

These forces have to be equivalent and thus

                                  1

Thus, the height is

Example 7.6: Two Liquid Layers                                  Level: Intermediate

In the introduction to this section, it was assumed that above liquid is a gas

with inconsequential density. Suppose that the above layer is another liquid

which has a bit lighter density. Body with density between the two liquids,

l < s < rhoh is floating between the two liquids. Develop the relationship
between the densities of liquids and solid and the location of the solid cubical.

There are situations where density is a function of the depth. What will be the

location of solid body if the liquid density varied parabolically.

Solution

In the discussion to this section, it was shown that the net force is the body volume
times the density of the liquid. In the same vein, the body can be separated into two:
one in first liquid and one in the second liquid. In this case there are two different
liquid densities. The net force down is the weight of the body c h A. Where h is the
height of the body and A is its cross section. This force is balance according to above
explanation by the two liquid as

                           c 쮐쭭 = 쭭쮐 ( l + (1 - )h)

Where  is the fraction that is in low liquid. After rearrangement it became
                                               = c - h
                                                     l - h

the second part deals with the case where the density varied parabolically. The density

    Thus the equilibration will be achieved, A is canceled on both sides, when

                 c h =              x1 +h  h -     x 2 (h - l) dx

    After the integration the equation transferred into

                  (3  c h = l - 3 h) x12 + (3 h l - 3 h h) x1 + h2 l + 2 h2 h
                                                              3h

    And the location where the lower point of the body (the physical), x1, will be at

                                                   6 h-2 l

    For linear relationship the following results can be obtained.

                                  x1 = h l + h h - 6 c
                                              2 l - 2 h

    In many cases in reality the variations occur in small zone compare to the size of
    the body. Thus, the calculations can be carried out under the assumption of sharp
    change. However, if the body is smaller compare to the zone of variation, they have
    to accounted for.

    the sphere is R. For the thickness below this critical value, develop an equation

    for the depth of the sphere.

The first two solutions are imaginary thus not valid for the physical world. The last
solution is the solution that was needed. The depth that sphere will be located depends
on the ratio of t/R which similar analysis to the above. For a given ratio of t/R, the
weight displaced by the sphere has to be same as the sphere weight. The volume of

        Example 7.8: Variable Weight                              Level: Easy

    One of the common questions in buoyancy is the weight with variable cross
    section and fix load. For example, a wood wedge of wood with a fix weight/load.
    The general question is at what the depth of the object (i.e. wedge) will be
    located. For simplicity, assume that the body is of a solid material.

    Solution

    It is assumed that the volume can be written as a function of the depth. As it was

    shown in the previous example, the relationship between the depth and the displaced

    liquid volume of the sphere. Here it is assumed that this relationship can be written

    as

                        Vw = f (d, other geometrical parameters)  (7.8.a)

    The Archimedes balance on the body is

    In example 7.8 a general solution was provided. Find the reverse function, f -1
    for cone with 30 when the tip is in the bottom.

    Solution

    First the function has to built for d (depth).

                                              d2
                                d 
                                              3 = d    3          (7.9.a)

                        Vw =               3        9

    Thus, the depth is

there are two unknowns and another equation is needed. In the liquid net force on
submerged triangle is

7.3 Applications of Buoyancy

Example 7.11: Hydrometer                                      Level: Intermediate

Instrument used to measure the density liquid is called a hydrometer. One

possible design is a big heavy spherical ball attached to thin glass with a pipe of

diameter, D. The spherical ball is designed to weighed down so the rig will float

straight up. The hydrometer is placed in two liquids with different densities.

Assume that 1 > 2. What is the difference in height above surface for these
two situations. Assume the air has no weight.

Solution

Again this question deals with Archimedes' law. In fact this device has a long history
and it was "invented" numerous times. This question deals with the calibration of
this device. The volume of the spherical attachment (acting like a ballast) denoted
as V0. The pipe has lower density than the liquid under the examination. The total
mass of the hydrometer is fix and denoted as m0 and total weight is m0 g. According
to Archimedes law it should be placed by the buoyancy force.

          m0 g = 1                                  A         (7.11.a)

Where l1 is the length of the pipe in the case 1.

     In the case 2 the same equation can be written                        End of Ex. 7.11

                                 m0 g = 2 V0 + l2  D2/4                               (7.11.b)

The length can be expressed from Eq. (7.11.a) as

                                           m0 g - V0
                                                1                                     (7.11.c)
                                     l1 =        D2/4

and the difference in the height is                                                   (7.11.d)

Example 7.13: Extruded Isosceles Triangle                                 Level: Intermediate

Extruded wooden isosceles triangle can float in liquid in many positions. For

this excises consider two positions triangle floats on the head or the bottom.

There is difference how much height triangle will be above the liquid. Draw the

ratio of these two heights as a function of the density of of the wood to the

liquid.  That  is  the  density  of  the  wood  obeys  0  <  s     <  1.  Show  that  the  length
                                                             
of the triangle is irrelavente for this calculations. This question is a preparation

of the stability as this height above the liquid.

Solution

While the question deals with geometry and it effects on physics. Archimedes' law
dictates that the area in both cases must be same. The relationship between the
densities ratio and the area has to be established. In Case 1 the Archimedes' law is

                                 s B H e2 &L& g =  h1 b1 e2 &L& g                     (7.13.a)

where index 1 and 2 refer to the case1 and case 2 respectively. The geometry identity
relates the different sides of the triangle for both cases as

                H = h ----------- b = B h                                        (7.13.b)

For the case 2 the Archimedes's law is (now without the length and the gravity)

                   s B H =  (H - h2) b2 + B                                      (7.13.d)

Eq. (7.13.f) can be simplified as

              s = 1 - h2                  h2 + 1 ----- 1 - h2 2                  (7.13.f )

    (it is not far away from the shape of the ship). For the following shape calculate
    the buoyancy centroid. When the ship is empty draft is 14.5[m] and when the
    ship is the fully loaded the draft is 16[mm] The ship's width is 59[m] and ship
    length is about 399[m]. Assuming that the ship is made from uniform material
    what the distance GB?

    Solution

    The width and the length of the ship do effect the buoyancy centroid. The centroid
    is half of the depth. In this case, the value is 7.25[m] when empty and 8[m] when the
    ship is full.

ment, it is referred to as the neutral

stable. An example of such situation is a rounded body, like a marble, on flat surface1

Floating uniform density bodies are, as it can be observed, are inherently "unsta-

ble" because the gravity centroid is always above buoyancy centroid (case c in Fig. 8.1).

Only at extreme cases where liquid density is almost equal to the density of solid body

it will be neutral stability. Bodies with none uniform densities can be both situations, in

stable and unstable. The bodies with none uniform density can be arranged so that the

mass centroid in lower position and the buoyancy centroid. This fact can be illustrated

by Fig. 8.4 where the mass/gravity centroid can be at lower point than the buoyant

center. The discussion here will be focused on uniformed bodies as they provide more

complicated situations. The none uniformed bodies are like uniform bodies but with

a movable gravity centroid. To understand the unstable zone consider Fig. 8.1 which

shows a body made of a hollow balloon and a heavy sphere connected by a thin and

the balloon in middle (b) there is a slight deviation from the previous case. Case 3

depicts (right side) almost opposite to case (a). This arrangement has mass centroid

close to the middle of the sphere. The buoyant centroid is below the middle of the

balloon. If this arrangement is inserted into liquid and will be floating, the balloon will

be on the top and sphere on the bottom Fig. 8.1a. Tilting the body with a small angle

from its resting position creates a shift in the forces direction to return original state

(examine Fig. 8.1a). These forces create a moment which wants to return the body to

the resting (original) position. When the body is at the position shown in Fig. 8.1c, the

body is unstable and any tilt from the original position creates moment that will further

continue to move the body from its original position. This analysis doesn't violate the

second law of thermodynamics because it takes energy to move the body to the unstable

situation.

to the above statement. Yet, when a

body (solid) is placed on top of liquid, the conditions of stability are more complicated.

It is not longer sufficient for the gravity centroid to be about the contact area (the same

area as in the solid). Furthermore, in one liquid the body can be stable while in another

liquid the body is unstable. Even the number of stable points and their locations are

different between the liquid and the solid.

8.2 Centroid of Floating Body or Buoyancy Centroid

To carry this analysis a new concept has to introduce, the centroid of displaced liquid or
Buoyancy Centroid which is denoted "B." The pressure center discussed in Section 6.2.2
in this section expanded to deals with the equivalents force that acting on the floating
bodies. To illustrate this point consider an arbitrary shape floats on liquid shown in
Fig. 8.2. It was shown, in this book, that the force acting on floating body must be
only in the vertical direction. Furthermore, the liquid pressure must be balanced the
displaced liquid. The equivalent force of the pressure acting on the body in equilibrium
can be obtained from calculating the (mass) centroid of the displaced liquid. Note
that the above statement is correct for arbitrary density (for example, if the density,
 = f (h)). If the body is not in equilibrium with the floating force, it does not act at
the mass centroid. The location and direction of the force is some distance from the
mass centroid yet in the vertical direction under stationary conditions.

serted into liquid. In this specific case, half

the block floats above liquid line. The cubic

mass (weight) is in the middle of the cubic                           G

(assuming uniform density). However the

buoyancy center is the middle of the vol-                             B

ume under the water (see Fig. 8.4). This

situation is similar to Fig. 8.1c. However,                Fig. 8.4 - Schematic of Cubic

in immediate returning away from the original position. For example, under the condi-

tions where the solid density is half of the liquid, the distance between GB (also AB) is

exactly quarter of the side (b/4) as it can be observed from the drawing. The location

of gravity centroid is fixed at b/4 and centroid of the immersed part is b/4 and hence

GB = b/2 - b/4 = b/4. The buoyancy force is the weight of the cubic. When the

buoyancy centroid is exactly under the mass/gravity centroid (of the cubic), it can be

in equilibrium. What happen when the buoyancy force and gravity force are slightly

deviate from the equilibrium? This question is the core of stability analysis.

         The stability can be answered by        b/2 tan   Yb

inclination of the body by purple line.

When the centroid point appears right to the purple line the body is unstable and

conversely the body is stable (to be on the left hand side of the purple line   ).

In Ex. 4.7 it was shown that

               = tan-1 tan  b 2  -1  b 2
                              6d                  = tan  6d              (8.1)

In this case b/d = 2 and hence Eq. (8.1) reads 4/3 > 1 and thus  >  because  is a

monotonic linear increase function. Thus, this situation is unstable and the cubic will

tilted away.

    The prerequisite condition for stabil-

ity is that the gravity centroid and the buoy-

ancy centroid must lay on the same vertical

line. When this condition is not met the

situation is unstable. For cylindrical shape,                G
(z-coordinate which is perpendicular to liq-
uid surface)2 this condition is fulfilled at all                      b
angles. Hence the cylindrical shape fulfills
the prerequisite stability requirement. How-             b B 3 2

fulfilled only under specific angles. For ex-

shape this requirement appear in two an-
gles: one vertically up and one at 45.

Eq. (4.22) describes the change of buoyancy center as a function of the rotation3.

The change in buoyancy centroid does not follow the change in the gravity rotation

for the rectangular. In other words the two centerids are not on the same vertical line.

Thus, for practical purposes there are only two angles that this condition occur and

thus can be stable. The first location was role out and now the second angle is under
the investigation.4

       When the cubic is floating at 45 degree the mass centroid remains in the same

location. Yet, the immersed volume (area) is now an isosceles triangle with two 45

degree angles. Note the gravity centroid and buoyancy centroid are on the same vertical

line. To keep the same volume (area) the base is at the corner of the cubic shown in

Fig. 8.6. Under the same procedure shown in Fig. 4.8 the relationship between the  is

given as by Eq. (4.7.h). For the sake of explanation, the equation is copied to here

in this situation. It has to emphasis that it referred to specific density (in other words
that body density is half of the liquid).

       From geometrical consideration (see Table 4.2 page 45) center is 1/3 of the
height. The height is b/ 2 and hence the AB (more importantly GB) is b/3 2. It
can be noticed that in this case the value GB is smaller than the GB distance in the
upright situation, that is b/4 > b/3 2. The value of GB (or AB) in the upright is
about 0.01429774 b larger than the tilted case but any other configuration. Yet for both
cases the forces are identical (why? because body has the same mass yet the moment is
smaller due to a small leverage.). This point is actually the base for the energy method.

       In this case, all the situations are "unstable" (the term unstable is used because
G is above B and therefor forces are pointing to each other) yet the case with the 45
degree is the least "unstable" (shown in Fig. 8.1c) because when turned the moment
turns body to the original state. Hence, the (45 degree) location is the most stable.
Also note body has the smallest moment (the force is the same). This topic is related
to curve of dynamical stability and Moseley's formula (for stability not rays). Yet, this
topic will not be covered in this book.

       In other geometries and/or other densities of liquid and floating body, this kind of
analysis has to done to determine the least "unstable" situation. This analysis can be
done in a conventional way which will presented first and in new innovative approach.
The conventional method introduces a new geometrical location which used to describe
the stability while this location is physical it requires calculations and it is not "visible."
While the conventional approach is used by many, now this undersign recommends to
utilize the new direct examination method. Additional advance of the new method
is simple explain and demonstration of the concepts. For instance, the diagrams build
with the help of this methods shows the transition from the stability to unstable because
change of density ratio. This method also shows the important parameters and their
combination. Thus, the GM should not appear but the the ratio of GM/D should be
used.

       The potential method is simpler and practical but requires some theoretical un-
derstanding and abstraction of the physics.

pletely symmetrical. Thus, even a body is given a small rotation in one direction the

buoyancy centroid can move in 3-D. However, in most cases, the change in the other

directions is "minor" and can be ignored. The quantitative test is the ratio /5. The

value of this ratio indicts how much stable the body at a specific position. Most of the

calculations could be done numerically.

        The core of this idea mentioned in the introduction and it will be expanded here.

There are two possibilities one with  <  shown in brown in Fig. 8.7 and two with

body toward the original state. In other words, it creates a moment that return original

angle.

     boundary ratio of 1:0.39 tend to be unstable. The material used in this experiment is

     with the model.

  Example 8.1: Minimum Condition for 3D               Level: Intermediate
What are the minimum conditions for 3D effects?

Solution

The cause of 3D effect is the asymmetry in two directions "opposite to the motion at
question." That is a ship that perfectly symmetrical along the length of the ship but
"front" (bow) and "back" (stern) are asymmetrical (for various reasons) the centroid
of the ship move along back and forth (between the bow and the stern) as result ship
has yaw rotation. (that is for example, roll creates yaw).

It was shown that Eq. (4.15) the relationship is

small. And for practical application the stability condition is

                   V0

This equation is correct only under the condition that point A is fixed. Point A is fixed
only when floating body when the area does not change with the height. For example,
if body is extruded rectangular or cylinder then A is fixed. However, floating bodies
like extruded triangle or a cone do not have a fixed centroid (at the cross area at the
liquid level). The analysis of such situation will be in the next version of the book.
Nevertheless, a simple motivation is provided. Grossly, there are two zones separated
by a border that the previous discussion dealt with. In other words, the border is the
bodies that centroid are fixed (body with constant area as a function of the height).
Bodies that the cross section is increasing with the height like cone that its pinnacle is
in the liquid. In that case, centroid of the cross section area is moving with the angle.
To illustrate this point, consider the extruded triangle depicted in Fig. 8.11. On the
left the centroid moves to the left and on the right the centroid moves to right. The
movement of the centroid to the right (right body in Fig. 8.11) increases the angle, ,
which make the body more stable and vise versa. Note, for case where the cross section
area decreases with the height, a regular analysis is sufficient because the shifting of
point A increase the stability.

What are the conditions that extruded rectangular shape will be floating stable
in a liquid (see Fig. 8.12). Assume that the dimensions of the rectangular are
s >> b long and the crosse section is b the width and D the height are same
magnitude. The example is repeat one of the previous example.

Solution

The governing equation Eq. (8.4) determines the stability conditions. In this case, GB
is given by D/2 - d/2 the moment of inertia given in the book b3 s/12. The volume

is V0 = d b s.

                                                                                               b2

The results of Eq. (8.2.e) are depicted in Fig. 8.13. It can be noticed that (as expected)

for large values of b/D the body is stable. However, when the density ratio is very
small ( s - 0) or very large ( s - 1) (solid density is close to liquid density)
even for small value the ratio of geometries the body is stable (not intuitive). In the

mid range of densities requires a larger ratio of b/D. Note that edge close range
s/ - 0 or s/ - 1 this analysis is not applied.

This topic should be part of dimensional analysis. In view to make part of the coherent

flow of material it is present here. Nevertheless, it is add to here as a temporary place

holder.

       This discussion deals with uniform density. When extruded rectangular floating

body in liquid there is two regimes. These two regimes are separated by half point
(s = 0.5 ). At this limiting case when a square turning to 45 there are three corners
(or one if half corner is considered to be out) in the liquid. Otherwise, there are two
corners in the liquid at all time. When (s > 0.5 ) then there are situations where two
corners or three corners inside the liquid. There are no situation with only one corner.
Conversely, in the case (s < 0.5 ) there are only one corner or two corners in the
liquid.

The Fig. 8.17 exhibits the stability diagram of the base down triangle. As oppose to
the extruded rectangular which has a dome, the base down triangle has no ability to
be stable at high density ratio. The reason for it is that moment of inertia approaches
to zero while the volume is increasing. On the other side, when the peak was in the
liquid then at high density ratio the body is more stable. The position that body will
be have that two conditions are satisfied. That it was studied yet and the significance
was not explored.

Example 8.4: Cylinder Wedge                                      Level: Intermediate

A cylinder is floating on a liquid when z coordinate is upright. Under what

conditions the cylinder is stable. Is 3-D effects appears in the stability analysis

of the cylinder under the condition in this question.

Solution

There is no 3-D effects because the cylinder is symmetrical in both directions around
the x axis and the y axis. The condition for stability is

                                GB  Ixx                          (8.4.a)
                                          V0

The moment of inertia of circle is given in table 4.2 Ixx =  r4/4. The volume of
the submerged part is  r2 d. The location of point A = D/2 and the location of

B = d/2. The last part is to related between submerged volume to total volume as

                                d  = D s                         (8.4.b)

Armed with all the components Eq. (8.4.a) can be written as

                                                            r2

                                          e r4
                             D2 - d2  e r2 4 d

which can be rearranged as

                             D 1 - s  r2 = r2
                             2  4 d 4 D s

                                                               

and finally get the form as

                             r  2 s 1 - s                        (8.4.c)
                             D                

It can be observed that the smallest possible value of the Eq. (8.4.c) when the ratio
(s/ = 0.5) and in that case, r > 2D. The results are presented in Fig. 8.18
The strange fact is the stability line appears symmetrical as the rectangular shape in
regard to densities ratio.

     was rejected for physical reasons.

     The condition for stability expressed in Eq. (8.3) can simplified as

     The solution of equations (8.6.i) provide the relationship between r and D and densities
     ratio so limiting case of stability is established. For this chapter this point is a stopping
     point. The relationships found here can be drawn.

     is with agreement with the model.

question in which angle the body is stable was not discussed. The trial and error
and methods can be used however, another methods can be used. For example, the
extruded rectangular has moment of inertia which is increases with the inclination angle,
 (1/ cos3 ). In some situation as depicted in the figures the inclination change to
some degree or point and no further. To sharpener the question, again more tilding
the rectangular results in larger moment of inertia while the volume remain the same.
Thus, according to this argument all the body should continue to rotate maximum
moment of inertia. In fact, the experiments that this author has done show that body is
stable around that several points and they not continues (with the exception of cylinder
"type" on the side). The reason for singularly of these points is that another condition
has to be fulfilled. The buoyancy centerid must be on the same line vertical line with
the buoyancy centerid. So the question should be locate all the angle in which the
buoyancy and gravity centerids are on the same line. Then check if that point is stable.
For instance, in the case of rectangular and case of s/ell is the same line are on
angles 0 and 45.

     of the volume in liquid (water). Assume that
     density ratio is s/ . Is there limits on the
     density ratio.

     Solution

     The answer the question requires solve the governing equation. In this case the
     moment of inertia of half triangle is hb3/24 for rotating triangle around the base.
     There are four half triangles and thus the total moment of inertia is hb3/6. The
     immersed volume of the body is

                                  V0 = 2 b h d = b h d
                                                 2

     The relationship of the density ratio to heights (Archimedes Law) is

                                         d = D s                           (8.5)

     According to Eq. (8.6) the stability is affected by the density ratio and by the ratio
     of b/D. Furthermore, according to this model the stability is not function of length,
     h. However, according to this model it is build on the idea that that there in marine
     terminology there is no pitch (rotating in the other direction). If h is the same order
     as b then this model is fail to take into account the stability of the other direction.
     Hence, with these hand waving argument h must at least two time of b.

     It can be observed fromFig. 8.26 that for small density ratios a large angle is required.
     This results is obvious and it is based on intuitive. However, it expect that required
     angle will have "jump" at the initial and the final zone. For large range the change is
     approaching a linear. Again, it must be noted that this results is not the final because
     the change of the rotation line and large tilde angle is applied then the triangle might
     not be stale.

Since G is fix for all circles while B is unknown. The left side of the equation can be
reduced. For example, for s/ = 0.5 it becomes

                es(2r)3                                             (8.8)
       Ixx V = 12 0 es r2 = 4 r 3 

                   2

Thus, the centroid is found and the depth (s) is irrelevant but to the results but is useful
tool in calculation the centroid of any fraction of the circle. In general, the moment of
inertia of and area of the golden area can be evaluated and the direct expression is

       B = G - Ixx = r - b3/12                                      (8.9)
                    V0 2 A

The area is readily available and hence center of buoyancy can be calculated.
       The question that must follow this discussion is whether the circular contour is

some kind of boundary between stable and unstable contours? The investigation so far
shows and indicants that it is the case but there should additional stipulation which
was not formulated yet. For example, a removal of small section of the circle make the
body unstable and the "circle" will turn away.

8.5 Potential Energy Approach

This method was suggested by Erd쮗s at el and was slightly improved by Abolhassani.
This method based on the idea that a derivative of potential energy can provide a
location or locations where a system has a minimum (or maximum) and thus it is
potential of stability point6. The energy used in this scenario is the gravitational energy
that is expressed as

       Usys = (M + m) g hM+m = g (m hm + M hM )                     (8.10)

    6This topic should be discussed elementary physics class and not fluid mechanics textbook. However,
if there will be a significant request it will be briefly discussed.

Where subscript sys referred to the entire system. The m is referred to floating body
and M is referred to the displaced liquid in other words to the mass if the liquid was
filling the submerged volume. The logic to the last definition is that it represents the
potential of the buoyancy force acting in the center immersed part. The change in the
potential is due to the change in the angle

     dUsys = 0  (8.11)

The condition that angle,  is by checking the second derivative if it positive or negative.
In away doing example it will repetitive of the moment method converting it to potential

The last chapter two methods were discussed: the Direct Examination and the abstract
Potential Energy. The cousin of the direct examination is the Metacenter method. In
Metacenter method, the ship or the floating body is given a small rotation or tilde (as in
Direct Examination) and instead of resulting angle, a distance from the gravity centroid
to new imaginary location (Metacenter) is measured. If the distance G to M is point
up it considered to possible and vice versa. If the distance is positive then the body is
stable and if it is negative the body is unstable. The advantages and short falls will be
discussed at the end of the Chapter.

       Assuming the general body is floating and it is at a certain configuration. The
body is tilted by a given small angle, , and the resulting distance is measured. As
opposed the perceived public opinion, the tilting point is around point A and not around
imaginary point M1. If the body will be rotating around point M it will not keep the
displaced volume constant. The immersed part of the body centroid translates to a
new location, B' as shown in Fig. 9.1. The mass (gravity) centroid is still at the same
old location since the body itself does not change (on moving gravity center later).
This deviation of the buoyant centroid from the old buoyant centroid, B, is similarly
as it was done in the Direct Examination. The right brown area (volume) in Fig. 9.1
is displaced by the same area (really the volume) on left since the weight of the body
didn't change2so the total immersed area (volume) is constant.

can be obtained from the geometry as Metacenter point! definition

the analysis is still correct because the volume and not the area should be used.

Example 9.2: What to do to save the Ship        Level: Easy

Assume that you are on a floating body (boat or ship) and it is about turn to
it the side. what should you in order to save the floating body? Throw items
over board or bring more things to ship like your raft that is normally tied to
your boat?

Solution

If the ship or the boat is light that throwing items will make more stable. On the other
the boat is almost full and you should add more items and make it as heavy as you
can (even pump water into the ship). It is common to have a maximum load marking
on the ship or boat. Normally this point should be design in about 30% of the ship
displacement. Thus, if the convention is applied that it better to throw as much as
possible. The reason that maximum mark exist is or should be for stability reasons.
Load about that point will the ship unstable (below safety factor).
As anecdote of this author, on his ship mechanic duty exam (on a missile boat) a com-
mon question was what to do when ship shows signs of turning. The proper answer was
to pump and throw overboard everything as possible out. The question was originated
by someone experienced it first hand without any the theoretical understanding.

GM for various densities ratios and ratios of r/D.

Solution

This example basically repeat Ex. 9.1 for cylinder. The immersed volume is  d r2 The
moment of inertia of circular shape is  r4/4.

9.2.1 Unstable Bodies, Negative GM

What happen when the GM negative values or in other words the height (draft) increases
beyond the critical height ratio? The body will flip into the side and turn to the next
stable point (angle). This is not a hypothetical question, but rather practical. This
stable point (that is body at new angle) will be point where body will be rotating
around. At that point, the possible rotation swing to the deck is smaller and thus the
ship is less stable.

       This situation happens when a ship is overloaded with containers above the max-
imum height. In commercial ships, the fuel is stored at the bottom of the ship and thus
the mass centroid (point G) is changing during the voyage. So, the ship that was stable
(positive GM) leaving the initial port might became unstable (negative GM) before
reaching the destination port. It is the responsibility of the officer (captain) to be aware
of this pitfall.

9.3 The GZ diagram

A typical approach in stability instead        M A                D
of looking at the value of GM a dif-
ferent imaginary distance is checked.                   Gz
This distance is what called the right
hand arm. This refers to distance be-                    B Be B'

                                                     b

tween the gravity and buoyancy forces.

In Fig. 9.6 depicts the distance GZ .    Fig. 9.6 - The right arm distance is display as
This distance is perpendicular to the         GZ as a function of 
line B M . The line GBe is parallel to

B M . Be is the buoyancy point that obtained when the equilibrium is achieved. In

other words, this point is the point the regular B that travels through until the stability

point. It can be noticed that his change occurs when the body is rotated and it no

question stability. In this analysis, the question is the location of buoyancy centroid.

This examination is based on the size of the right turning arm. When the arm length

is zero the floating body is stable or that is point like watershed line after which the

body will turn to next stable point.

In this analysis, the buoyancy centroid will be determined. The simple way to

explain this point is by example. First body that will be dealt is the extruded rectangular

like the one show in Fig. 9.6. Utilizing Eq. (4.20) provides the buoyancy centroid. For

simplicity, first the vertical distance between the buoyancy centroid to the liquid of the

water is calculated. Later, the horizontal distance between the gravity centroid and the

buoyancy centroid.
       The vertical distance can asses by finding first distance B L which can ascertained

by

B L = C - LN = C - C tan                                             (9.7)

The vertical distance is then

V D = B L cos  = (C - C tan ) cos                                    (9.8)

Dividing equation by draft, D yields

V D = C - C tan  cos                                                 (9.9)

C = r + b tan  - tan2                         b 21                   (9.10)

C = b - 1                                 b 2 tan                    (9.11)

notice that the displaced volume is fix and independent of the angle of inclination. The
maximum angle that body can turn before it get over the edge is

       Fig. 9.9 shows the results of the vertical distance as a function for various density
ratio and various b/D ratio. For small values value of b/D the vertical distance become
smaller. For example, for b/D = 0.5 almost all the values are trending down. While
the values treading up for large values see Fig. 9.8d. This trend is consistent with the

                             Fig. 9.13 - The effects of liquid movement on the GM .

Ships and other floating bodies carry liquid or have a load which changes the mass
location during tilting of the floating body. For example, a ship that carries wheat
grains where the cargo is not properly secured to the ship. The movement of the load
(grains, furniture, and/or liquid) does not occur in the same speed as the body itself
or the displaced outside liquid. Sometimes, the slow reaction of the load, for stability
analysis, is enough to be ignored. Exact analysis requires taking into account these
shifting mass speeds. However, here, the extreme case where the load reacts in the
same speed as the tilting of the ship/floating body is examined. For practical purposes,
it is used as a limit for the stability analysis. There are situations where the real case
approaches to this extreme. These situations involve liquid with a low viscosity (like
water, alcohol) and ship with low natural frequency (later on the frequency of the ships).
Moreover, in this analysis, the dynamics are ignored and only the statics is examined
(see Figure 9.13).

       A body is loaded with liquid "L" and is floating in a liquid "F" as shown in Figure
9.13. When the body is given a tilting position the body displaces the liquid on the
outside. At the same time, the liquid inside is changing its mass centroid. The moment
created by the inside displaced liquid is

Min = g lLIxxL                                                  (9.19)

Note that IxxL isn't the identical to the moment of inertia of the outside liquid interface.
       The change in the mass centroid of the liquid "L" then is

Equation (9.20) shows that GG is only a function of the geometry. This quantity,
G1G1, is similar for all liquid tanks on the floating body.

       The total change of the vessel is then calculated similarly to center area calcula-

tions.

     g mtotal GG = $g m$b$od$ Xy +0 g mf G1G1                                       (9.21)

For more than one tank, it can be written as

     GG = g                      ng                            n Ixxbi                (9.22)

     Wtotal i=1                                   Wtotal i=1 Vbi

A new point can be defined as Gc. This point is the intersection of the center line with
the vertical line from G .

                                 G Gc = GG                                            (9.23)

The distance that was used before GM is replaced by the criterion for stability by Gc M
and is expressed as

     Gc M = g A IxxA - GB - 1 Ixxb                                                    (9.24)
                                 sVbody           mtotal Vb

If there are more than one tank partially filled with liquid, the general formula is

     Gc M = g A IxxA - GB - 1 n Ixxbi                                                 (9.25)
                                 sVbody       mtotal i=1 Vbi

     One way to reduce the effect of

the moving mass center due to liquid

is done by substituting a single tank

with several tanks. The moment of                 T            d
inertial of the combine two tanks is

smaller than the moment of inertial of                                   h
a single tank. Increasing the number                           G

of tanks reduces the moment of in-

ertia. The engineer could design the     Fig. 9.14 - Measurement of GM of floating body.
tanks in such a way that the moment

of inertia is operationally changed. This control of the stability, GM, can be achieved

by having some tanks spanning across the entire body with tanks spanning on parts of

the body. Movement of the liquid (mostly the fuel and water) provides way to control

the stability, GM, of the ship.

       The examination of the GZ can be treated as linear for small range. Hence, this
       fact can be basically making the ship or the floating body act as it is a pendulum
       in some senses. Yet at the present case the mass or the moment of inertia is not
       easy to calculate. In movement of pendulum in air the added mass and the add
       moment of inertia are hard to calculated and is not negligible. The governing
       equation for the pendulum is

                                    - g  = 0                       (9.26)

in Hz. The period of the cycle is 2  /g. Similar situation exists in the case

of floating bodies. The basic differential equation is used to balance and is

In the same fashion the frequency of the floating body is

                                   1 V s GM                         (9.28)

       In general, the larger GM the more stable the floating body is. Increase in GM
       increases the frequency of the floating body. If the floating body is used to
       transport humans and/or other creatures or sensitive cargo it requires to reduce
       the GM so that the traveling will be smoother.

Meta End

9.4.2 Limitations

This topic is dealing with several aspects of fluid mechanics like wave propagation on
shallow liquid and the add mass. Admittedly these topics are very advance and require
considerable amount of material to explain them. Simplified explanation is provided.
The take away of this section to illustrate that the analysis is is provides the limit
and the actual movement are some what different. When the ship or the floating body
undergoes rolling,the shape of the body is fixed (to very large degree) while the shape or
the configuration of the liquid in the container or the tank is not. The actual time to get
124                                                CHAPTER 9. METACENTER

the shape that should be assumed to be in a steady state. Steady state refers to a state
which obtained when the particles stay at that location for ever (again approximate
definition). How long it takes for the liquid to reach a steady state is very hard to
calculate. However, it (to ascertain) is a much easier to do. First, it has to define the
characteristic time (the typical time to for liquid to move from side to side).

       The movement of the liquid from side to side is done by a wave (this claim is
without a proof and more about it will appear in the book of "Basic of Fluid Mechanics"
by this author). The speed of the wave over liquid in a shallow liquid is approximated
by gravity and the liquid depth.

                            U  hg                                        (9.30)

This equation provides a reasonable estimate of the velocity. The time required is then

                                   b/2                                   (9.31)

                                     hg

When writing Eq. (9.31), it was assumed that the average distance is about the half
the width (b/2) (liquid is moving side to side). Several additional assumptions have to
be made to find the characteristic time liquid movement. What is the

       When the body or the ship is rolling the

9.5 Metacentric Height, GM, Measurement

The metacentric height can be measured by finding the change in the angle when a
weight is moved on the floating body.

       Moving the weight, T a distance, d then the moment created is

                            Mweight = T d                                (9.32)

This moment is balanced by

                            Mrighting = WtotalGMnew                      (9.33)

Where, Wtotal, is the total weight of the floating body including measuring weight.
The angle, , is measured as the difference in the orientation of the floating body. The

metacentric height is

                            GMnew = T d                                  (9.34)
                                          Wtotal 

If the change in the GM can be neglected, equation (9.34) provides the solution. The
calculation of GM can be improved by taking into account the effect of the measuring
weight. The change in height of G is

                             g mtotal Gnew = g mship Gactual + g T h  (9.35)
Combining equation (9.35) with equation (9.34) results in

     GMactual = GMnew mtotal - h T                                       (9.36)

9.6. STABILITY OF SUBMERGED BODIES  125

9.6 Stability of Submerged Bodies

The analysis of submerged bodied is different from the stability when the body lays
between two fluid layers with different density. When the body is submerged in a single
fluid layer, then none of the changes of buoyant centroid occurs. Thus, the mass
centroid must be below than buoyant centroid in order to have stable condition. Stable
conditions

       However, all fluids have density varied in some degree. In cases where the density
changes significantly, it must be taken into account. For an example of such a case is
an object floating in a solar pond where the upper layer is made of water with lower
salinity than the bottom layer(change up to 20% of the density). When the floating
object is immersed into two layers, the stability analysis must take into account the
changes of the displaced liquids of the two liquid layers. The calculations for such cases
are a bit more complicated but based on the similar principles. Generally, this density
change helps to increase the stability of the floating bodies. This analysis is out of the
scope of this book (for now).

9.7 Stability of None Systematical or "Strange" Bodies

This topic was address somewhat in the previous chapter and will be expanded in the
following versions of this book. Previously, the discussion dealt with smooth transition
in which the cross section area is a smooth function of the height. In section the
discussion deals with abrupt change in the cross section. The change is more profound.
Consider two extreme cases, one where narrow immersed body and two the wide part
immersed. The rotation point A is not rotating and move in two different directions
depending on cross section area (as function of the height) direction. Clearly without
calculating any data, one can observed that the body with the wide immersed part
rotating point A moves to the right while the other case the rotating point A moves
to left. In, the change if direct of the rotating point change the way calculations are
carried out. Never the lest it is clear wide immersed body is more stable.

       While most floating bodies are symmetrical or semi-symmetrical, there are situ-
ations where the body has a "strange" and/or un-symmetrical body. The calculations
will appear in the following versions. These are on the same considerations that that
were discussed in the previous chapter.

                                  Fig. 10.1 - Body with movable gravity centroid.

Ship and other floating bodies do not have a constant density. In other words, the
gravity centroid moves depend on the loading to a different location in the ship or body.
That point is different from the centroid of the entire body. However, the buoyancy
centroid is in the same location. located before as it depend on the displaced volume.
If the gravity centroid is below the buoyancy centroid then the body is stable and no
further calculations are needed. However, for most cases the issue to find how much
to change the location of the gravity centroid to the vessel is stable. This chapter is
dealing with the requirement on location of the gravity centroid for given geometry.

the geometry, what are the requirements on the location of the gravity centroid to make
the body stable. A new triangle can be build that is now made from tree points B, B
and G.

                                           V0

The location of gravity in solid body (or floating body) is at G and normally is at the
centroid of the entire body. The distance required to lower the gravity to make the
body stable is GG'. Hence,

                    GG = BG - BG ---- GG = BG - Ixx                                    (10.3)

After the required distance is calculated, a weight needed to be attached, to bottom,
or other place. The weight size is based on the calculations explained in Chapter 4.

     in this example, a possible correction will be calculated (GG').

     The Fig. 8.13 shows the shape where the rectangular is unstable and for that range

the required change is calculated. Eq. (8.2.e) is copied here for the boundary.

      b = 6 s 1 - s                                                                                                              (10..a)

                                                  D

In this case BG = D/2 - d/2 and thus the GG' is

It can be observed that the largest change should be made when the density is when
the liquid density is relatively very law. Most large ships are with density ratio on the
upper limit has the change is relatively small.

     The famous ship Ever Giving for this excise can be consider as extruded square
     box with the following dimension L = 400[m] b = 60[m] and the D = 60[m].
     The maximum draft (the depth) the ship can be in the liquid is 16[m]. What
     is the minimum requirement on gravity centroid.

     The ratio of b/D = 1 in this case. From the value of d and D the ratio of density can be
     estimated as 16/60 = 0.267 and observing from Fig. 10.3 the value of GG /D = 0.075

it became that gravity centroid has to be at least below the 25[m] from the bottom
of the ship.

11.1 Introduction

While ships are build to be stable (for the most part), there are several situations where
it is not sufficient. Ships act as a giant pendulum but with several distinct characteristics
(varying hinge point, varying moment of inertia, changing the damping elements etc )
which will be discussed in this chapter. Under certain conditions, these giant pendulums
create a problem to the cargo on board. This issue leads to accidents in which cargo
(containers) damaged. This problem could to be due to the resonance of the ship with
cargo (there could other reasons). This chapter focus on this issue. There numerous
investigations with estimate cost of over 10 millions dollars while cost of the actual
damages was high as a billion dollars. Thus, this issue deserves a chapter examining the
various factors of this problem and mechanisms in which they created. In this chapter,
a discussion is presented on the general parameters and a dimensional analysis of the
problem.

       To understand thermodynamics, the material is categorized into equilibrium and
none-equilibrium zones. That is, initially classes use and presented the steam tables and
treated as Holy Grail for example, water boil at about 100C at atmospheric pressure.
This ability to carry calculations, based on this rough estimate, simplifies the ability to
obtain reasonable results. Yet, when precise values are required the effect of the heat
flow rate, surface tension, and boiling surface must be taken into account1. The real
reason for this separation is created helpful system so engineers simplify the calculations.
The same should be done for stability, and the quasi-equilibrium study should be done

    1The purity of the water is deliberately does not appear in the list because they common and yet
less important. For example, the change in salinity for common material like sea water can be a few
degree while the smooth surface change thy boiling temperature by about 30C or more.

before the full dynamics is implemented.
       Obviously, the location of the rotation hinge of the pendulum is important to

understand the ship movement. The value of the moment of inertia depends on this
location. Yet, numerous works deal with the dynamics situations (where the ship is
not in equilibrium in z direction), yet, the rotation hinge is not known. In dynamics
situations the hinge point deviates slightly from the quasi-equilibrium. Hence, the
knowledge this hinge point at quasi-equilibrium is essential and should be known before
tackling the dynamics aspects. In this chapter, deals with quasi-equilibrium state and
attempt to establish it. Furthermore, the deviations from the normal such as trim and
list are not dealt at this stage.

It to be established here that there is no problem with the linear motions: heave, sway,
surge.The sway and surge (check Fig. 11.1), no ship will be capsizing because these
motions (neglecting the transfer of energy mechanisms)2. In the extreme the heave, in
theory, can cause drowning of the floating body if the magnitude of movement is such
it exposed the opening to the liquid. However, if there is enough extra floating, most
waves amplitude are not sufficient to capsizing which are not common (this author is
not aware of a single case of such issue was for a commercial ship)3 .

     Example 11.1: Heave motion                         Level: Intermediate

     A large container ship (the Ever Giving) with the size of 60 [m] width and 400

     [m] long is pushed 1[m] into the sea. Estimate the force that requires to create

     this movement. How much water the ship has to be covered to create this

     force. The ship height is 60 [m] and ship is about 50% inside the water. How

     large force is required to be to push this ship 25% down? What is the estimated

     acceleration of ship at this point?

     Solution

     The weight of the 1 cubic meter of water is about 1 tonne which for simplicity,

even large ship. Yet, this remark is true for "normal" waves.

    3The author was supposed to be served on Mazada owned by Zim Israel Navigation Co. of Haifa
on her last vogue 1981. The ship sank because admission of to much water due to leaking storage
compartments. But, the ship did not because of heave movement.
11.1. INTRODUCTION                                                                           135

                                                                            End of Ex. 11.1
this value is taken as standard for this example. The force is then simply evaluated as
60400 = 24, 000 tonnes. To push the ship 1 [m] the ship has to be covered with 1[m]
of water. Large ship do not covered with a miters of water and thus heave movement

is limited. To have 25% movement it has to be covered by the same amount of water.

In case of Ever Giving the entire ship has to be covered by 15 [m] of water (it is very
fast wave of 45 [m] and very long 400 [m] long). The force is 15  60  400tonnes.
The question of the acceleration is important because it determines the time the body

will be under the liquid which determines possibility of drowning. It can be shown that

this situation (to be constructed example in chapter 12) it analogous to a block with
density of half of the liquid at depth of 15[m]. The mass of the block is V s and the
net force is V ( - s). The acceleration is the ratio of these two quantities

                    a = V ( - s) g =  - 1 g  (11.1.a)
                    V s  s

which in this case is about g. Thus, to cause drowning the wave speed has to be in
order magnitude or larger than g 2 L . Where L in this case is the ship length.

       It was demonstrated that the heave is not dangerous up to the point where the
ship openings is exposed to the liquid. The heave movement is mainly concern of
the increase of the resistance to the flow (ship movement). The yaw rotation (again
without the transfer mechanism) is not dangerous because the obvious observation (see
Fig. 11.1). The pitch rotation can be caused by either by the transfer mechanisms or
waves from the x or y (non symmetrical wave) directions. Of the three rotation motions
the rolling is the most important and dangerous to the ship. It not to say that there are
no situations where a small boat along the pitch rotation can overturned (the author
personally observed such case of capsizing). These situations simply are less common
and specialty case study. After examining numerous papers on the effects of rolling
this author had a strong urge to utilize the standards fluid mechanics tools to write a
governing equation(s). As usual, the examination previous work will be followed by a
discussion on various terms of the governing equation with circumstances under which
the equation can be simplified. Due to the mathematical difficulties, the previous work
focus was on the mathematical aspects of the problems. That is, little care was given
to the physical meaning of the terms and mainly focus was on solving the mathematics.
For example, (Taylan 2004; Taylan 2000) considered the speed of ship and damping
force as the mathematical functionality.

       The rolling rotation has unique features that makes it very difficult to understand
as compared to regular pendulum rotation motion. The fact is that until this point, no
one even formulate the complete governing equation and discuss what physical elements
and how they interact. The "regular" rotation has forces/moments balanced around a
fix point which may or may not have external inputs (sometimes referred as exciting
input). Floating body among other things has several elements that are unique such
shifting rotation point and shifting mass and/moment of inertia. The second issue
is transformation mechanism from one rotation to another which will be addressed in
this chapter. This author has not found a single source to which discuss the transfer
136                                               CHAPTER 11. ROLLING

mechanism from one rotation to another with the exception of the wave in the x
direction or surge that results in a rolling motion. The basic theory for this effect is
that a wave moves along the ship change GM during the time ship passes the wave.
This idea as far it can be judged was suggested by France and Shin (France, Levadou,
Treakle, Paulling, Michel, and Moore 2003; Shin, Belenky, Paulling, Weems, and Lin
2004).The ship, according to this theory, has to be exposed to a waves with a frequency
of twice the natural ship frequency (Van Laarhoven 2009) which is defined as

                                   =   g V0 GM                             (11.1)
                                      Ixx + Madd

where  is the natural frequency and Madd is the added mass of the ship4 and the
other properties are regular terms used in the book This equation can be recognized
as the regular term from a simple pendulum. In addition, the wave length has to be
at certain conditions (while they are not specified). In the said paper, it seem from
the equation has a simple units mistake and the added mass should be replaced by the
added moment of inertia (logically and dimensionally). (to be added as example to
the dimensional analysis chapter) It is not clear from the model what causes the rolling
beside that the rolling is possible if the natural frequency was correct. This model
disregards the ship shape, shifting rotation point, and other important characteristics.
There are several problems with the assumptions that this model build on and they will
be discussed later.

11.2 Historical Background

One of the latest work (Remola 2018) formulated the governing equation as

          d2                          , d    + MR = MW (t)                 (11.2)
     Ixx 2 + MD                          dt

          dt

where MD is the damping function which is depend on the angle and the angular velocity,
MR = GZ V0. The moment of inertia, Ixx, is in the yz plane and is assumed to be
calculated around M point which is the metacenter). Ixx is the moment of inertia
assumed to be constant and include the added moment of inertia. Various sources
are assuming that the causing the rolling is the waves from different directions. In
construction, this equation it was assumed no coupling with other motions in the other
directions based on (Spyrou and Thompson 2000). with some objections by (Bulian,
Francescutto, and Fucile 2009) which are based on "because a good balance is achieved
between simplicity and accuracy."

       The actual equation that most researchers are trying to solve is without the
damping effect. An example of such work on the ship rolling is by (Jovanoski and
Robinson 2009) pointing to quite well phenomena to stability zones that dampingless
equation created. Under the assumption of specific wave it is assumed (Allievi and

11.3 Physical Considerations

11.3.1 Added Mass and Added Moment of Inertia

At the current stage, it is important to discuss the physics of the situation. During the

rotation of the ship beside the moment of inertia of the ship (around a point which

will be discuss later) there additional material that is affected the ship moment of

inertia. This material has a moment of inertia (around the same point) and is referred

as the added moment of inertia. The added moment of inertia term has several issues

that have to be addressed. This term appears in the current researchers derivation as

a constant value. That is, the total moment of inertia expressed as Iship + Iadd when
both are considered to be constant (Remola 2018). Where add is denoting the added

property. As Landweber and Miloh

(Landweber and Miloh 1980) have shown

that the added moment of inertia is con-

stant for constant acceleration for the same                         40

                                                                     5      Full-Fn=0.1

                                                                     0

model on the added moment of inertia.

       The second issue that affects the vari-  Fig. 11.2 - Added moment of inertia Af-
ation of the added moment of inertia is the          ter Kianejad et al. Notice that the

extruded area (depends on the density ratio) and changes to extruded trapezoid or
138                        CHAPTER 11. ROLLING

extruded triangle depends on the angle). Hence, at every angle the body has different
immersed geometry and therefore different added moment of inertia. The calculated
Fig. 11.2 by Kianejad et al (Kianejad, Enshaei, and Ranmuthugala 2017) shows more or
less constant value. If one accept this calculations that a constant value can be used6.
If one insist on the constant value (reduction of accuracy idea) a better representation
is in nature of the added moment of inertia.

     Iadd = 0.5 ( Iadd|min + Iadd|max)  (11.5)

Where Iadd|min is the minimum added moment of inertia and Iadd|max is estimate of
the maximum In general this term should be written as

     Iadd = Iadd|0 + f ()               (11.6)

The value of Iadd|0 is at zero rotation and f () can be positive or negative to maximum
value of Iadd|0. Kianejad et al calculated the value of the specific ship of the added
moment of inertia (Kianejad, Enshaei, and Ranmuthugala 2017). The authors did not
specified the rotation point and used almost the full Nervier-Stokes equation (including
the turbulence and shear stress.)7. The work by Kianejad et al was based on work
by Korotkin and others (Korotkin 2008) which original definition of the added mass
is based the surrounding material for ideal flow (that is the viscosity and turbulence
must be ignored as these not part of the added properties.). Between these two works
there were additional steps or works that and the research groups who was using these
techniques. At writing this section it is not clear who introduce this strange definition
of the added moment of inertia into "research" stream. The fact that there added
moment of inertia include additional effects makes it none standard added properties.
Due to the fact that these values are not based on known standards they should be
ignored and hope that they should recalculated and converted to regular standard in
the future.

       Perhaps the biggest issue in this case is the change of location of the rotation point
or hinge. As opposed to commonly believed the rotation point is not at the metacenter
but at the surface of the liquid (for quasi-equilibrium calculations and extruded liked
bodies). For two-dimensional shape, it is at the middle of the liquid line.

    6This author did work on the specific code that done by researchers. However, one cannot wonder
if the equations that were used are correct as they include viscosity and turbulence none which should
be used in added properties. Thus, it possible that added moment of inertia is defined differently than
the common added moment of inertia. The paper too abstract and does not specify what is really
going on and hence it hard to ascertain the validity of the work. Several other papers by other research
groups suggest this approach and yet none of them even provide the location of the rotation point for
which it was calculated. In this stage, this undersigned takes this work to mean none standard added
moment of inertia which some how include the dissipation terms.

    6The source of the added moment of inertia is dragging of liquid due to the body geometry. Perfect
cylindrical shape do no drag any mass on rotation because the fiction is not considered and thus the
added moment of inertia has no added moment of inertia (yet it has added mass).

    7The researchers cannot answer the questions this author present them.

Example 11.2: The Rotation location  Level: Advanced

One misunderstood point in rotation of ship especially for rolling motion is the

center of rotation. This point has profound effect on the frequency and other

parameters. The liquid surface (wetted area) changes during the rolling motion.

Demonstrate that the rotation point is the middle of the liquid surface for two

dimensional shape.

Solution

As first approximation the ship is assumed to have a constant mass. This assumption
is reasonable for the case where the ship shape does not have a large abrupt shape and
the acceleration of the movement is relatively small. For practical purposes, a change
of the mass up to 5% is still within zone for this analysis (much more complicate
analysis results from stringent requirements).
When the ship mass is constant (quasi steady state) then the instantaneous dis-
placement (assuming the heave movement is insignificant) the displacement volume
is constant under these two assumptions. If the ship has continuous liquid surface
(that is, the ship is not catamaran or trimaran) the rotation is at some point on the
liquid surface. As long the ship shape is continuous, the subtracted area has to be
equal added area. These two areas are, at the limit, strait triangles. The two triangles
have the same area if the height and the base are the same in the two triangles. This
condition occurs when the heights is the same which mean the rotation must occur
at the middle the liquid surface.

       The rotation point moves to a new location when the body/ship is turning to
new angle because the middle of the liquid surface is at new location which depends on
the geometry. Almost all the shape of the ships are such that creates a change in the
hinge line or hinge point. The only exception to this a cylinder (or sphere in 3D) (in
general symmetrical bodies round the z coordinate.). Hence, this effect has to be taken
into account. The significance of this effect can be demonstrated by triangle up versus
triangle down. Thus even the experimental attempts to measure it when ignoring the
shifting of the hinge line (Balcer 2004) are not fruitful. Note, even the correct initial
hinge line was erroneously identified at the metacenter. The literature survey show that
not much work was done on these topics. For example Markeev (Markeev 2017) study
moving mass on the pendulum in 2017. Some what related work by Legaza (Legeza
2020) dealt with movable hinge for building. While some work has been done on this
two topics, they not well understood and the theatrical base is still missing.

  Example 11.3: Square Rotation Point Movement Level: Intermediate
A square is rotating 5. Assume that density ratio is s/ = 0.25 Where is
the location of the rotation point at that angle? How much the moment of the
inertia change by percent?

The source of the original motion is generally not relevant to the transfer mechanism
of the motion from one mode to another. The cause of the transfer is the geometry
of the floating body. One body shape that does not transfer from one mode to an-
other is sphere. There is source of waves or other exciting forces/moments (beside the
magnetic forces) that can cause transfer. Thus, the transfer of the motion from one
mode to another is because symmetry (or asymmetry) of the body. Here, the transfer
mechanisms are divided into two categories: one, from rotation in one dimension to
rotation in another dimension, and two from rotation to linear motion (vis versa). The
transfer from linear motion to linear motion is considered as the second category8.

       The movement of a floating body can be transferred due to the geometry from
one mode to another. To understand this transfer consider the T-shape body depicted
in Fig. 11.6. The extend part of the body is just touching the liquid. In this case
the regular marine coordinate system is adapted. If the body is rotating around the
x coordinate (or around another parallel line) the buoyancy centroid will change the
location. Furthermore, the change in buoyancy centroid move has component in the
x direction. The centroid moves to new location which in different plane that original
z - -y plane. Assuming that the body was at equilibrium, the change of the buoyancy
centroid which has component in the direction of x and y and it creates moment in
the y axis (pitch) and also around z (yew). This T-shape body is created by adding

    8In discussion with one of the reader he point out that in the future it will be considered the third
category. Time will tell.
11.4. TRANSFER MECHANISMS                                                    143

body however similar effect can be created by removing part of the body. The meaning

of removing body is that a body when rotated exhibits a depression. Generally, if the

body is not symmetrical round y any rotation around the x coordinate creates rotation

y coordinate and z coordinate. The gravity centroid remains the same location on the

body. Thus, there is a new moment that acting the new direction. The described effect

is of roll causing pitch (and yaw). Yet, the same argument can describe pitch movement

causing roll. In this discussion, the source of the rotation is irrelevant.

The previous discussion dealt with the transfer from one rotation to another

rotation due to the floating body asymmetry

(in previous case the asymmetry was around

the yz plane). It can be expended to move-    y     G
ment of linear like heave to rotation. The
main difference in this category is that the     x

moment transferred into force. It must be           B

mentioned that the energy during the trans-

fer is constant and the transfer is reduce

the oscillations or the movement because      Fig. 11.7 - Extruded triangle to explain
the energy is transferred. Additionally, the       the movement transfer from Heave to

pend on the change of the buoyancy

centroid. The forces in the x coordinate are equal and opposite to each other and

hence cancel each other. However, the forces in the y direction are are not equal and

cause a moment which will results in the rolling rotation. That is, in this case the

asymmetry in around y coordinate transfer energy from the heave to roll. If the floating

body is not perfect symmetry it also might create movement in other directions. Note

that if the body was made from straight lines going down it will not any effect on the

other direction linear motion.

The conceptional explanation has to get engineering expression. First the transfer

from roll to pitch requires to know the change in B due to the roll. The calculation of

the change in the x direction is done similar fashion that the change buoyancy centroid

was ascertained for symmetrical body. These calculations are 3-D nature at least for

the presentation. As this book (at least this version) is pioneer this aspect and the

technique presented here to calculate is crude. Not to bogged with the mathematics

the functionally assumed to be known. Consider the body shown in Fig. 11.6. First,

the change in the z - y of buoyancy is considered. The body is divided into many small

slices of with thickness of dx. For each slice the change in buoyancy and it is denoted as

dB. This value is a function of x and same time the area can be calculated it denoted

as A(x) (in mathematical term it referred as the weight function). The change in the

y direction is

                B()x = 1 B(x)A(x)dx                                          (11.7)

                                                                                  (11.10)
The location of point 1 is                                                        (11.11)

                                            x1 = L1 sin 1
                                            y1 = -L1 cos 1

The location of point 2 is

                                          x2 = x1 + L2 sin 2
                                          y2 = y1 - L2 cos 2

Taking the derivative to obtain the velocity

                                           x1 = 1 L1 cos 1
                                            y1 = 1 L1 sin 1

In the same way for the second point

                          x2 = x1 + 2 L2 cos 2                   (11.12)
                          y2 = y1 + 2 L2 sin 2

The second derivative is

                          x1 = 12L1 sin 1 + 1 L1 cos 1           (11.13)
                          y1 = 12L11 cos 1 + 1 L1 sin 1

the second derivative is for the second point

x2 = x1 22 L2 sin 2 + 2 L2 cos 2                                 (11.14)
y2 = y1 + 22 L2 cos 2 + 2 L2 sin 2

where T denotes the tension and m denotes the mass and standard stationary equation
can be written. The forces that act on mass 1 and mass 2 are the tension in the rods
and the gravity.

                                m1 x1 = -T1 sin 1 + T2 sin 2     (11.15)
                                m1 y1 = T1 cos 1T2 cos 2 - m1 g

and for the second point

m2 x2 = T2 sin 2                                                 (11.16)
m2 y2 = T2 cos 2 - m2 g                                          (11.17)

Basically there are 4 equations and 4 unknowns (T1, T2, 1, and 2). Notice that
x1, x2, y1, and y2 are a simple function of L and  with the right indexes. After
the elimination or conversion of "dummy" variables (T1, T2) results in two equations
with unknowns which can be solved by numerical methods like Runge Kutta method.
No recommendations on the specific methods is provided.

       The results are strongly depend on the initial conditions. There several conclusions
can be drown from the results which are very relevant to floating body stability. The
chief conclusion is that standard natural frequency does not exist. The results are more
chaotic that one expect. For small angle the behavior is close to a simple pendulum.
Even with going through more complicate examination one can see that situation get
more complex (this with including the change of moment of inertia and other factors).

11.5.2 Double Pendulum with Circular Motion with Mass Distri-
           bution

This section is out reach for many of the readers because it involve advance physics and
concept like Lagrangian. These concepts are used because the complication of writing
the governing equations. The usage of Lagrangian provides the governing equations
146                                                      CHAPTER 11. ROLLING

in a standard form. Equations presented in a standard form and thus element the
need to usage of vectors. With the Lagrangian methods there is no need to solve for
accelerations or a need to solve for inertial velocities. So simple demonstration of usage
of Lagrangian for simple pendulum is presented. The Lagrangian function is defined
as the difference between the total kinetic energy, T and total potential energy U of
system.

                             L=T -U                               (11.18)

For simple pendulum with point mass with arm length, the potential energy is relative
the lowest point and for small angle. The velocity is

                             v=                                   (11.19)

The total kinetic energy is

                             T = m v2 = m 22                      (11.20)
                             2       2

The potential energy, U, in case of simple pendulum, depends only on the height. For
simplicity the potential energy is assigned U ( = 0) = 0 Thus the potential energy can
be written as

                             U = y m g = (1 - cos ) m g           (11.21)

With these two terms the Lagrangian is explicitly can written as

     L = T - U = g m ( )2 - (1 - cos ) m g                        (11.22)
                             2

For the next part The governing equation is obtained utilizing for zero non-conservative
forces by

                             ddt ( L  ) - L  = 0                  (11.23)

substituting L into Eq. (11.23) yields                            (11.24)
                      m 2  + m g sin  = 0 ----  + g sin  = 0

which is the standard equation for simple pendulum.

It can be noticed that coordinate system          x1 1                m1I1                 2

It is assumed that rod are evenly distribute otherwise new dimension can be introduced.

                                                                2

                                     y2 = - 1 cos 1 - 2 cos 2
                                                                   2

The kinetic energy can be expressed as

T = m1 v12 + m2 v22 + I1 12 + I2 22                                                           (11.28)
                         2     2               2                      2

The potential energy is

                         U = g y1 m1 + g y2 m2                                                (11.29)

Thus the Lagrangian is

L = T - U = m1 v12 + m2 v22 + I1 12 + I2 22 - m1gy1 - m2gy2.                                  (11.30)

Assuming no external forces the governing equations are obtained from

point was to establish the method and demonstrate the ship rotation similar to double
pendulum but with a twist in which the relationship between the hinge to physics is

11.6 Appendix: The Added Properties

The explanation of the added properties is very complicated at least the mathematical
part of it 9 This material way out scope of this book yet, it is here just to provide a
justification why this term is added. This addition due to the realization that a body
moves in a liquid it drags additional (therefore the word added) material/mass (in the
liquid phase). This addition strongly depends on the geometry of the body and the its
acceleration. For example, a sphere moving steady state has coefficient of add mass is
0.5 which can be larger than the momentum of the body itself. This value is, roughly
speaking, calculated by the singular points of potential flow. The added moment of
inertia of the ship body depends on the angle of the ship and the acceleration.

11.8 Change of Center of Rotation

At first the discussion deals with 2D cases as they simpler as compared to 3D. The
center of ration is at the middle of the liquid line (for two dimensional body). However,
the change of the center of rotation is in the average of addition to right and the
subtraction to the left assume counter-clock turn. In this derivation it is assumed that
the body is extruded that is it only 2-D and the angle is very small. Later it will derive
for measurable angles. In this derivations the body is not assumed to symmetrical. The
total change is made of the change to the right and to the left. The change to the right
is

12.1 Introductory Remarks

The reasons that this chapter is included in this book to eliminate the tables for various
situation but to have dimensionless presentation so tables should be included in the
equations them self. For example, in Metacenter method the parameter GM is not
given in dimensionless form. What is the meaning of GM 1[m] while it say the ship
is stable and does not indicate if it is very stable or not. One has to get additional
information. The indication that this question of stability is has relatively small of
parameters which indicate that it has to none-dimensionalized.
What is dimensionless analysis? Dimensional analysis refers to techniques dealing with
units or conversion to a unitless system. The definition of dimensional analysis is not
consistent in the literature which span over various fields (mostly in the thermo-fluid
field) (Buckingham 1914; Buckingham 1915b; Buckingham 1915a). Possible topics
that dimensional analysis deals with are consistency of the units, change order of mag-
nitude, applying from the old and known to unknown (see the Book of Ecclesiastes),
and creation of group parameters without any dimensions. In this chapter, the focus is
on the creation the creation of dimensionless groups. These techniques gave birth to
dimensional parameters which have a great scientific importance (G쮗rtler 1975; Lang-

                                                    151

haar 1980). Since the 1940s1, the dimensional analysis is taught and written in all fluid,
heat and mass transfer textbooks. The approach or the technique used in some of these
books is referred to as Buckingham--theory. The -theory was coined by Bucking-
ham. However, there is another technique which is referred to in the literature as the
Nusselt's method. Both these methods attempt to reduce the number of parameters
which affect the problem and reduce the labor in solving the problem. The key in these
techniques lays in the fact of consistency of the dimensions of any possible governing
equation(s) and the fact that some dimensions are reoccurring. The Buckingham-
goes further and no equations are solved and even no knowledge about these equations
is required. In Buckingham's technique only the dimensions or the properties of the
problem at hand are analyzed. This author is aware of only a single class of cases were
Buckingham's methods is useful and or can solve the problem namely the pendulum
class problem (and similar).
The dimensional analysis was independently developed by Nusselt and improved by his
students/co-workers (Schmidt, Eckert) in which the governing equations are used as
well. Thus, more information is put into the problem and thus a better understanding
on the dimensionless parameters is extracted. The advantage or disadvantage of these
similar methods depend on the point of view. The Buckingham- technique is simpler
while Nusselt's technique produces a better result. Sometime, the simplicity of Buck-
ingham's technique yields insufficient knowledge or simply becomes useless. When no
governing equations are found, Buckingham's method has usefulness. It can be argued
that these situations really do not exist in the Thermo-Fluid field. Nusselt's technique
is more cumbersome but more precise and provide more useful information. Both tech-
niques are discussed in this Chapter. The advantage of the Nusselt's technique are: a)
compact presentation, b)knowledge what parameters affect the problem, c) easier to ex-
tent the solution to more general situations. In very complex problems both techniques
suffer from in inability to provide a significant information on the effective parameters
such multi-phase flow etc.
It has to be recognized that the dimensional analysis provides answer to what group of
parameters affecting the problem and not the answer to the problem. In fact, there are
fields in thermo-fluid where dimensional analysis, is recognized as useless. For example,
the area of multiphase flows there is no solution based on dimensionless parameters
(with the exception of the rough solution of Martinelli). In the Buckingham's approach
it merely suggests the number of dimensional parameters based on a guess of all parame-
ters affecting the problem. Nusselt's technique provides the form of these dimensionless

    1The history of dimensional analysis is complex. Several scientists used this concept before Buck-
ingham and Nusselt (see below history section). Their work culminated at the point of publishing the
paper Buckingham's paper and independently constructed by Nusselt. It is interesting to point out
that there are several dimensionless numbers that bear Nusselt and his students name, Nusselt number,
Schmidt number, Eckert number. There is no known dimensionless number which bears Buckingham
name. Buckingham's technique is discussed and studied in Fluid Mechanics while almost completely
ignored by Heat and Mass Transfer researchers and their classes. Furthermore, in many advance fluid
mechanics classes Nusselt's technique is used and Buckingham's technique is abandoned. Perhaps this
fact can be attributed to tremendous influence Nusselt and his students had on the heat transfer field.
Even, this author can be accused for being bias as the Eckert's last student. However, this author
observed that Nusselt's technique is much more effective as it will demonstrated later.

parameters, and the relative relationship of these parameters.

12.1.1 Brief History

The idea of experimentation with a different, rather than the actual, dimension was
suggested by several individuals independently. Some attribute it to Newton (1686)
who coined the phrase of "great Principle of Similitude." Later, Maxwell a Scottish
Physicist played a major role in establishing the basic units of mass, length, and time
as building blocks of all other units. Another example, John Smeaton (8 June 1724-28
October 1792) was an English civil and mechanical engineer who study relation between
propeller/wind mill and similar devices to the pressure and velocity of the driving forces.
Jean B. J. Fourier (1768-1830) first attempted to formulate the dimensional analysis
theory. This idea was extend by William Froude (1810-1871) by relating the modeling
of open channel flow and actual body but more importantly the relationship between
drag of models to actual ships. While the majority of the contributions were done
by thermo-fluid guys the concept of the equivalent or similar propagated to other
fields. Aim큖em Vaschy, a German Mathematical Physicist (1857-1899), suggested
using similarity in electrical engineering and suggested the Norton circuit equivalence
theorems. Rayleigh probably was the first one who used dimensional analysis (1872) to
obtain the relationships between the physical quantities (see the question why the sky
is blue story).
Osborne Reynolds (1842-1912) was the first to derive and use dimensionless parameters
to analyze experimental data. Riabouchunsky2 proposed of relating temperature by
molecules velocity and thus creating dimensionless group with the byproduct of compact
solution (solution presented in a compact and simple form).
Buckingham culminated the dimensional analysis and similitude and presented it in a
more systematic form. In the about the same time (1915, Wilhelm Nusselt (November
25, 1882 - September 1, 1957), a German engineer, developed the dimensional analysis
(proposed the principal parameters) of heat transfer without knowledge about previous
work of Buckingham.

12.1.2 Theory Behind Dimensional Analysis

In chemistry it was recognized that there are fundamental elements that all the material
is made from (the atoms). That is, all the molecules are made from a combination of
different atoms. Similarly to this concept, it was recognized that in many physical
systems there are basic fundamental units which can describe all the other dimensions
or units in the system. For example, isothermal single component systems (which does
not undergo phase change, temperature change and observed no magnetic or electrical
effect) can be described by just basic four physical units. The units or dimensions
are, time, length, mass, quantity of substance (mole). For example, the dimension or
the units of force can be constructed utilizing Newton's second law i.e. mass times
acceleration - m a = M L/t2. Increase of degree of freedom, allowing this system

to be non-isothermal will increase only by one additional dimension of temperature,
. These five fundamental units are commonly the building blocks for most of the
discussion in fluid mechanics (see Table of basic units 13.3).

The choice of these basic units is not unique and several books and researchers suggest
a different choice of fundamental units. One common selection is substituting the mass
with the force in the previous selection (F, t, L, mol, Temperature). This author is not
aware of any discussion on the benefits of one method over the other method. Yet,
there are situations in which first method is better than the second one while in other
situations, it can be the reverse. Other selections are possible but not common and, at
the moment, will not be discussed here.

     Example 12.1: What are the units of                         Level: Easy

     What are the units of force when the basic units are: mass, length, time,
     temperature (M, L, t, )? What are the units of mass when the basic units
     are: force, length, time, temperature (F, L, t, T)? Notice the different notation
     for the temperature in the two systems of basic units. This notation has no
     significance but for historical reasons remained in use.

     Solution
12.1. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS                                                                   155

These two systems are related as the questions are the reversed
of each other. The connection between the mass and force can
be obtained from the simplified Newton's second law F = m a
where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.
Thus, the units of force are

                  ML                   (12..a)
            F= 2

                    t

For the second method the unit of mass are obtain from Equation

(12..a) as

            M = F t2                   (12..b)
                     L

The number of fundamental or basic dimensions determines the number of the combi-
nations which affect the physical3 situations. The dimensions or units which affect the
problem at hand can be reduced because these dimensions are repeating or reoccurring.
The Buckingham method is based on the fact that all equations must be consistent
with their units. That is the left hand side and the right hand side have to have the
same units. Because they have the same units the equations can be divided to create
unitless equations. This idea alludes to the fact that these unitless parameters can be
found without any knowledge of the governing equations. Thus, the arrangement of the
effecting parameters in unitless groups yields the affecting parameters. These unitless
parameters are the dimensional parameters. The following trivial example demonstrates
the consistency of units

Example 12.2: Newton's law dimensions  Level: Easy

Newton's equation has two terms that related to force F = m a + m U . Where
F is force, m is the mass, a is the acceleration and dot above m indicating
the mass derivative with respect to time. In particular case, this equation get a

form of

            F = ma+7                   (12..c)

where 7 represent the second term. What are the requirement on equation
(12..c)?

Solution

Clearly, the units of [F ], m a and 7 have to be same. The units
of force are [N ] which is defined by first term of the right hand
side. The same units force has to be applied to 7 thus it must

    3The dimensional analysis also applied in economics and other areas and the statement should
reflect this fact. However, this book is focused on engineering topics and other fields are not discussed.

   be in [N ].

Suppose that there is a relationship between a quantity a under the question and several
others parameters which either determined from experiments or theoretical consideration
which is of the form

                D = f (a1, a2,    , ai,    , an)           (12.1)

where D is dependent parameters and a1, a2,    , ai,    , an are have independent di-
mensions. From these independent parameters a1, a2,    , ai have independent di-

mensions (have basic dimensions). This mean that all the dimensions of the param-

eters ai+1,    , an can be written as combination of the the independent parameters
a1, a2,    , ai. In that case it is possible to write that every parameter in the later set

can written as dimensionless

                a1p1 , a2p2 ,    , aipi ai+1 = dimensionless  (12.2)

The "non-basic" parameter would be dimensionless when divided by appropriately and
selectively chosen set of constants p1, p2,    , pi.

Example 12.3: Clamping force                                     Level: Easy

In a experiment, the clamping force is measured. It was found that the clamping
force depends on the length of experimental setup, velocity of the upper part,
mass of the part, height of the experimental setup, and leverage the force is
applied. Chose the basic units and dependent parameters. Show that one of
the dependent parameters can be normalized.

Solution

The example suggest that the following relationship can be writ-

ten.

                              F = f (L, U, H, , m)               (12..d)

The basic units in this case are in this case or length, mass,
and time. No other basic unit is need to represent the problem.
Either L, H, or  can represent the length. The mass will be
represented by mass while the velocity has to be represented by
the velocity (or some combination of the velocity). Hence a one
possible choice for the basic dimension is L, m, and U . Any of
the other Lengths can be represented by simple division by the
L. For example

                Normalize parameter = H                          (12..e)

   Or the force also can be normalized as

Another Normalize parameter =              F     (12..f)

                                           mU L

The acceleration can be any part of acceleration component such
as centrifugal acceleration. Hence, the force is mass times the
acceleration.

The relationship (12.1) can be written in the light of the above explanation as

           D
a1p1 , a2p2 ,    , aip1 =

F ai+1 ,    , an                                                              (12.3)

where the indexes of the power p on the right hand side are single digit and the double
digits on the on the right hand side. While this "proof" shows the basic of the Buck-
ingham's method it actually provides merely the minimum number of the dimension
parameters. In fact, this method entrenched into the field while in most cases pro-
vides incomplete results. The fundamental reason for the erroneous results is because
the fundamental assumption of equation (12.1). This method provides a crude tool of
understanding.

12.1.3 Dimensional Parameters Application for Experimental
           Study

The solutions for any situations which are controlled by the same governing equations
with same boundary conditions regardless of the origin the equation. The solutions are
similar or identical regardless to the origin of the field no matter if the field is physical, or
economical, or biological. The Buckingham's technique implicitly suggested that since
the governing equations (in fluid mechanics) are essentially are the same, just knowing
the parameters is enough the identify the problem. This idea alludes to connections
between similar parameters to similar solution. The non-dimensionalization i.e. opera-
tion of reducing the number affecting parameters, has a useful by-product, the analogy
in other words, the solution by experiments or other cases. The analogy or similitude
refers to understanding one phenomenon from the study of another phenomenon. This
technique is employed in many fluid mechanics situations. For example, study of com-
pressible flow (a flow where the density change plays a significant part) can be achieved
by study of surface of open channel flow. The compressible flow is also similar to traffic
on the highway. Thus for similar governing equations if the solution exists for one case
it is a solution to both cases.
158  CHAPTER 12. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

     The analogy can be used to con-

duct experiment in a cheaper way and/or

a safer way. Experiments in different scale

than actual dimensions can be conducted

for cases where the actual dimensions are                              D2

difficult to handle. For example, study of

large air planes can done on small mod-

els. On the other situations, larger mod-    D1

els are used to study small or fast situ-

ations. This author believes that at the

tremely limited use for the real world and

yet this method is presented in the classes  Fig. 12.1 - Fitting rod into a hole.

on fluid mechanics. Thus, many examples

on the use of this method will be presented in this book. On the other hand, Nusselt's

method has a larger practical use in the real world and therefore will be presented for

those who need dimensional analysis for the real world. Dimensional analysis is useful

also for those who are dealing with the numerical research/calculation. This method

supplement knowledge when some parameters should be taken into account and why.

     Fitting a rod into a circular hole (see Figure 12.1) is an example how dimensional

analysis can be used. To solve this problem, it is required to know two parameters;

1) the rode diameter and 2) the diameter of the hole. Actually, it is required to have

only one parameter, the ratio of the rode diameter to the hole diameter. The ratio is

a dimensionless number and with this number one can tell that for a ratio larger than

one, the rode will not enter the hole; and a ratio smaller than one, the rod is too small.

Only when the ratio is equal to one, the rode is said to be fit. This presentation allows

one to draw or present the situation by using only one coordinate, the radius ratio.

Furthermore, if one wants to deal with tolerances, the dimensional analysis can easily

be extended to say that when the ratio is equal from 0.99 to 1.0 the rode is fitting, and

etc. If one were to use the two diameters description, further significant information

will be needed. In the preceding simplistic example, the advantages are minimal. In

many real problems this approach can remove clattered views and put the problem into

focus. Throughout this book the reader will notice that the systems/equations in many

cases are converted to a dimensionless form to augment understanding.

12.1.4 The Pendulum Class Problem

The only known problem that dimensional analysis can solve (to some degree) is the
pendulum class problem. In this section several examples of the pendulum type problem
are presented. The first example is the classic Pendulum problem.

                        = C1  agb                       (12..h)

The solution functional complexity is limited to the basic com-
bination which has to be in some form of multiplication of and
g in some power. In other words, the multiplication of g have
to be in the same units of the frequency units. Furthermore,
assuming, for example, that a trigonometric function relates
and g and frequency. For example, if a sin function is used, then
the functionality looks like  = sin( g). From the units point
of view, the result of operation not match i.e. (sec = sin (sec)).
For that reason the form in equation (12..h) is selected. To sat-
isfy equation (12..h) the units of every term are examined and
summarized the following table.

     Thus substituting of the Table 12.2 in equation (12..h) results in

                 t-1 = C1 L1 a L1 t-2 b = La+bt-2 b  (12..i)

     after further rearrangement by multiply the left hand side by L0

     results in

                 L0t-1 = C La+bt-2 b                 (12..j)

     In order to satisfy equation (12..j), the following must exist

                 0 = a + b and -1 = -2b              (12..k)

     The solution of the equations (12..k) is a = -1/2 and b = -1/2.

       What was found in this example is the form of the solution's equation and fre-
quency. Yet, the functionality e.g. the value of the constant was not found. The
constant can be obtained from experiment for plotting  as the abscissa and /g as
ordinate.

       According to some books and researchers, this part is the importance of the di-
mensional analysis. It can be noticed that the initial guess merely and actually determine
the results. If, however, the mass is added to considerations, a different result will be
obtained. If the guess is relevant and correct then the functional relationship can be
obtained by experiments.

12.2 Buckingham--Theorem

All the physical phenomena that is under the investigation have n physical effecting
parameters such that

                 F1(q1, q2, q3,    , qn) = 0                      (12.4)

where qi is the "i" parameter effecting the problem. For example, study of the pressure
difference created due to a flow in a pipe is a function of several parameters such

                 P = f (L, D, , , U )                               (12.5)

In this example, the chosen parameters are not necessarily the most important parame-
ters. For example, the viscosity,  can be replaced by dynamic viscosity, . The choice
is made normally as the result of experience and it can be observed that  is a function
of  and . Finding the important parameters is based on "good fortune" or perhaps
intuition. In that case, a new function can be defined as

                 F (P, L, D, , , U ) = 0                            (12.6)

4The reader can check if the mass is assumed to affect the problem then, the result is different.
12.2. BUCKINGHAM--THEOREM   161

Again as stated before, the study of every individual parameter will create incredible
amount of data. However, Buckingham's5 methods suggested to reduce the number of
parameters. If independent parameters of same physical situation is m thus in general
it can be written as

F2(1, 2, 3,    , m) = 0  (12.7)

If there are n variables in a problem and these variables contain m primary dimensions
(for example M, L, T), then the equation relating all the variables will have (n-m)
dimensionless groups.

       There are 2 conditions on the dimensionless parameters:

1. Each of the fundamental dimensions must appear in at least one of the m variables

2. It must not be possible to form a dimensionless group from one of the variables
   within a recurring set. A recurring set is a group of variables forming a dimen-
   sionless group.

       In the case of the pressure difference in the pipe (Equation (12.6)) there are 6
variables or n = 6. The number of the fundamental dimensions is 3 that is m = 3 ([M],
[L], [t]) The choice of fundamental or basic units is arbitrary in that any construction
of these units is possible. For example, another combination of the basic units is time,
force, mass is a proper choice. According to Buckingham's theorem the number of
dimensionless groups is n - m = 6 - 3 = 3. It can be written that one dimensionless
parameters is a function of two other parameter such as

1 = f (2, 3)                (12.8)

If indeed such a relationship exists, then, the number of parameters that control the
problem is reduced and the number of experiments that need to be carried is considerably
smaller. Note, the -theorem does not specify how the parameters should be selected
nor what combination is preferred.

12.2.1 Construction of the Dimensionless Parameters

In the construction of these parameters it must be realized that every dimensionless
parameters has to be independent. The meaning of independent is that one dimen-
sionless parameter is not a multiply or a division of another dimensional parameter. In
the above example there are three dimensionless parameters which required of at least
one of the physical parameter per each dimensionless parameter. Additionally, to make
these dimensionless parameters independent they cannot be multiply or division of each
other.

       For the pipe problem above, and D have the same dimension and therefore
both cannot be chosen as they have the same dimension. One possible combination

American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Vol. 37, 1915.
162               CHAPTER 12. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

is of D, U and  are chosen as the recurring set. The dimensions of these physical
variables are: D = [L1], velocity of U = [L t-1] and density as  = [M L-3]. Thus,
the first term D can provide the length, [L], the second term, U , can provide the time
[t], and the third term,  can provide the mass [M ]. The fundamental units, L, t, and
M are length, time and mass respectively. The fundamental units can be written in
terms of the physical units. The first term L is the described by D with the units of
[L]. The time, [t], can be expressed by D/U . The mass, [M ], can be expressed by
 D3. Now the dimensionless groups can be constructed by looking at the remaining
physical parameters, P , D and . The pressure difference, P , has dimensions of
[M L-1 t-2] Therefore, P M -1 L t2 is a dimensionless quantity and these values were

calculated just above this line. Thus, the first dimensionless group is

     [M L-1 t-2]  [M -1]                     [L]  [t2] unitless

     1 = P        1                               D2 P           (12.9)

                  D

The second dimensionless group (using D) is

                  [L] [L-1]

     2 = D                          -1 = D                       (12.10)
                                            L

The third dimensionless group (using  dimension of [M L1 t-1]) and therefore dimen-
sionless is

                   [M -1]                    [t]                 (12.11)

       This analysis is not unique and there can be several other possibilities for selecting
dimensionless parameters which are "legitimately" correct for this approach.

       There are roughly three categories of methods for obtaining the dimensionless
parameters. The first one solving it in one shot. This method is simple and useful for
a small number of parameters. Yet this method becomes complicated for large number
of parameters. The second method, some referred to as the building blocks method, is
described above. The third method is by using dimensional matrix which is used mostly
by mathematicians and is less useful for engineering purposes.

       The second and third methods require to identification of the building blocks.
These building blocks are used to construct the dimensionless parameters. There are
several requirements on these building blocks which were discussed on page 161. The
main point that the building block unit has to contain at least the basic or fundamental
unit. This requirement is logical since it is a building block. The last method is mostly
used by mathematicians which leads and connects to linear algebra. The fact that this
method used is the hall mark that the material was written by mathematician. Here,
this material will be introduced for completeness sake with examples and several terms
associated with this technique.

12.2.2 Similarity and Similitude

One of dimensional analysis is the key point is the concept that the solution can be ob-
tained by conducting experiments on similar but not identical systems. The analysis here
suggests and demonstrates6 that the solution is based on several dimensionless num-
bers. Hence, constructing experiments of the situation where the same dimensionless
parameters obtains could, in theory, yield a solution to problem at hand. Thus, knowing
what are dimensionless parameters should provide the knowledge of constructing the
experiments.

       In this section deals with these similarities which in the literature some refer as
analogy or similitude. It is hard to obtain complete similarity. Hence, there is discussion
how similar the model is to the prototype. It is common to differentiate between
three kinds of similarities: geometric, kinetics, and dynamic. This characterization
started because historical reasons and it, some times, has merit especially when applying
Buckingham's method. In Nusselt's method this differentiation is less important.

Geometric Similarity

       One of the logical part of dimensional analysis is how the experiences should be
similar to actual body they are supposed to represent. This logical conclusion is an add-
on and this author is not aware of any proof to this requirement based on Buckingham's
methods. Ironically, this conclusion is based on Nusselt's method which calls for the
same dimensionless boundary conditions. Again, Nusselt's method, sometimes or even
often, requires similarity because the requirements to the boundary conditions. Here7
this postulated idea is adapted.

       Under this idea the prototype area has to be square of the actual model or

Ap =  1 prototype                 2            2  (12.12)
Am      1 model                        2p
                                    =  2m

where 1 and 2 are the typical dimensions in two different directions and subscript p
refers to the prototype and m to the model. Under the same argument the volumes
change with the cubes of lengths.

       In some situations, the model faces inability to match two or more dimensionless
parameters. In that case, the solution is to sacrifice the geometric similarity to minimize
the undesirable effects. For example, river modeling requires to distort vertical scales
to eliminate the influence of surface tension or bed roughness or sedimentation.

Kinematic Similarity

       The perfect kinetics similarity is obtained when there are geometrical similarity
and the motions of the fluid above the objects are the same. If this similarity is not
possible, then the desire to achieve a motion "picture" which is characterized by ratios

    6This statement is too strong. It has to be recognized that the results are as good as the guessing
which in most cases is poor.

    7Because this book intend to help students to pass their exams, this book present what most
instructors required. It well established that this over-strict requirement and under Nusselt's method
it can be overcome.
164  CHAPTER 12. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

of corresponding velocities and accelerations is the same throughout the actual flow
field. It is common in the literature, to discuss the situations where the model and
prototype are similar but the velocities are different by a different scaling factor.

       The geometrical similarity aside the shapes and counters of the object it also can
requires surface roughness and erosion of surfaces of mobile surfaces or sedimentation
of particles surface tensions. These impose demands require a minimum on the friction
velocity. In some cases the minimum velocity can be Umin = w/. For example,
there is no way achieve low Reynolds number with thin film flow.

Dynamics Similarity

       The dynamic similarity has many confusing and conflicting definitions in the lit-
erature. Here this term refers to similarity of the forces. It follows, based on Newton's
second law, that this requires similarity in the accelerations and masses between the
model and prototype.

While the analysis was clumsy and rough it provides dimension-

less parameters while Buckingham's method fails dramatically.

12.3 Summary

The two dimensional analysis methods or approaches were presented in this chapter.
Buckingham's  technique is a quick "fix approach" which allow rough estimates and
relationship between model and prototype. Nusselt's approach provides an heavy duty
approach to examine what dimensionless parameters effect the problem. It can be shown
that these two techniques in some situations provide almost similar solution. In other
cases, these technique proves different and even conflicting results. The dimensional
analysis technique provides a way to simplify models (solving the governing equation by
experimental means) and to predict effecting parameters.
166  CHAPTER 12. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS
    13 Experiments for Stability

13.1 Introduction

This chapter intended for students who taking a stability class or fluid mechanics beside
professionals in marine industry. This chapter is intended to be supplemental to the
academic material but in other situations it could be a stand alone material. While
stability has mainly theoretical subjects. Yet, there are elements that should provide the
student with a hands-on experience. For this reason, several experiments are designed
to be performed by the instructor or by the students to provide the "missing" intuition.
The floating body stability is not intuitive as the stability of placing body on solid surface
and requires demonstration for various aspects. Even professionals could benefits from
these experiments due to the fact that many of these aspects are totally innovative.

       The first experiment deals with the stability diagram of floating bodies. Every
geometry of floating body has its own stability diagram and diagram demonstrates three
zones: stable, unstable, and neutral situations. The second experiment deals again with
stability diagram but for different geometries. The third experiment the measurements
of GM of the cylinder are carried out. The natural frequency of the floating body is
measured for constant cross. The change of the rotation location is estimated. The
principle axes experiment in which general shape of the "preferred" axes of rotation is
examined.

       The every experiment will be written as a separated document (that is, start from
a new page) and appear in this collection.

13.2 Stability Points of Various Bodies

13.2.1 Concept

Every body has a stability points (angles or positions) either on solid surface or in liquid
(while floating) for which the body is stable. The number of these points and their
angle depends on the geometry of the body. The intention of this experiment is to
build intuition in regards to the stability points and demonstrate the unpredictability of
these angles. This discussion is for the uniform density bodies.

13.2.2 Description

The existences of stability points is a fundamental concept in the stability analysis which
could be carried out by high school students , university students and by professionals.
The experiment is designed to demonstrate the existence of clear points (angles) in
which the body is stable around. At stability points, the body is stable while at other
angles the body is unstable. These points are different from the angles when the body
is at rest on solid surface. The neutral stability is also demonstrated in this experiment.

     Fig. 13.1 - Body on solid surface stable and unstable.

These bodies shown in the Fig. 13.1 have different stability points on liquid. The body
depicted in Fig. 13.1a has four point on solid and floating on liquid. While the body
depicted in Fig. 13.1a has two points but on liquid these point are at different angles.

13.2.3 Apparatus

The experiment is based on observation and not measurement and is relatively simple to
carry out. Yet, there are several issues to be pointed out, placing body on solid surface
compared to placing the body in liquid, estimating the number stable points (again
should be compared to solid), comparison change of one parameter of the geometry,
and change of density ratio. A container (preferred transparent) with an ability to
contain enough liquid in which the floating bodies can to be examined. Several bodies:
extruded squire, extruded circular, extruded rectangular (with different ratios). It also
should include a body similar to the one depicted Fig. 13.1b and one similar to one
depicted in Fig. 13.1a. The same bodies should be made out two different materials
(light and heaver like a styrofoam, and wood).

13.3 Cylinder Stability Diagram

13.3.1 Concept

This laboratory experiment is an exercise in stability. It is designed to demonstrate the
stability of floating bodies and to familiarize the student with the concepts of buoyancy,
neutral and stable and unstable situations, and stability dome. Every floating body has
a stability diagram which is depicting stability for certain angle. The vertical position
(angle) is often the most alluring for many applications. For example, rectangle in a
vertical position is useful for marine applications.

13.3.2 Description

The stability of the floating body for specific angle has what known as the stability
dome. The floating body buoyancy centroid, B, depends on the body shape and on its
orientation.

       A floating body has several stable positions (angles). The vertical position mimic
to some extent the shape of ship. A position can be stable under a certain density
ratio range. The stability dome is introduced via the change of the density ratio. In
other words, the experiment is designed to investigate the change density effect on the
stability. The change of the density effect is obtained by adding sand (or liquid) to the

Note that the gravity centroid changes also during filing process and it is accounted by
introducing the effective density ratio. The effective density concept is emulate body
with a constant density.

       This experimental is verification of the theory presented in this textbook. The
dome shown in stability map represents the limits of floating body stability. The effective
density of the floating body (s) is controlled by the amount liquid in the cylinder. A
discussion about the effective density is below. Thus, the density ratio can be varied by
filling the cylindrical container with liquid or sand.

       The core issue of the floating body stability is the locations of gravity centroid
and buoyancy centroid. The gravity is fixed in case of uniformed density body. In
172  CHAPTER 13. EXPERIMENTS FOR STABILITY

this case the gravity depends on the liquid level in the in the inner container (A). The
effective density ratio (or the simulated solid body density) is changed by amount liquid
poured into cylinder. As opposed to the fix case the buoyancy centroid can be calculated
from the middle of the height of the inner cylinder (regardless of the thickness of the
container.)

13.3.3 Apparatus

There are three components of the experimental set-up shown in Fig. 13.2:
   1. Large vertically-standing cylinder containing liquid (fresh water) denoted in figure
       as B
   2. Small cylinder with a detachable cap at one end denoted in figure as A
   3. weighing scale
       Insert the inner container to the large container empty. Fill the inner container

with small incremental amount of liquid (see Fig. 13.2). Measure the height of the
filling the liquid and records the mount. Check if the inner container is stable.

13.4 The procedure

   1. Measure the weight the inner container and indicate it on the report
   2. Fill the exterior container with liquid (fresh water or oil, etc)
   3. Inserted the inner container into the larger container
   4. Measure the thickness inner container wall
   5. Measure and record the height ho. This height is the initial height, ho0.
   6. Check if the cylinder is stable and record this information
   7. Add small amount of liquid into the inner container.
   8. Messure hi and ho
   9. Go item 6 if the inner cylinder is not full
  10. If the inner cylinder is full, it is the end of the process.

13.4.1 Data Analysis

The data analysis is made from two sections: the initial and the process parts. The
initial part deals with calibrations.

13.5 GM experiments

13.5.1 Concept

Simply stating, a body is stable if a small rotation is applied and body return to its
original state. In the old method is done by measuring the GM as a marker of the
stability. The body is stable when GM is positive. Note the GM is monotonic but not
a linear function, that is, GM=2[m] is more than 1[m] but not double in the "stability."

13.5.2 Description

In this experiment, the stability marker, GM, is obtained for specific geometry. In doing

so the concepts of stability, and metacenter are introduced. This concept was discussed

in chapter 9 and here it is verified. Due to fact this material could be used as a stand

alone this description is added.

The buoyancy centroid depends on submerged geometry. Assuming quasi steady

state, that is the body in equilibrium with

the liquid in the z direction and, forces act

on the body gravity and buoyancy are equal.             
However, the only deviation from the quasi                M2
steady state is in the roll (change in angle
                                                    G

of the body in the yz plane as defined in        M1
chapter 2).

and orientation (angle). When the body is

tilted in a small amount the buoyancy cen-     Fig. 13.3 - Genral change of B with two
troid moves as well. Thus, the buoyancy             possibilities.
centroid movement is such that B moves

to two possible zones with a border (the border is not shown explicitly) as shown

in Fig. 13.3. The right side is stable (blue color) and the unstable (brown color).

The border is made by a circular body which is neutral stability (under the G point).

The point of intersection of the lines of vertical line from the new buoyancy centroid

with the previous vertical line that goes through the B is referred as the metacenter

(M ) and the distance between the center of gravity (G) and M , is referred as the

metacentric height (GM , see Fig. 13.3).

The expression for the metacentric height GM is

                                  GM = Ixx - GB               (13.5)
                                            V0

where Ixx is the floating body moment of inertia at the liquid line, GB is the distance
between the gravity centroid and the old buoyancy centroid and V0 is volume of the
displaced liquid. For stability the metacentric height GM must be positive. Stability
(restoring force) increases with increasing GM .

       In this experiment, the mission to estimate the metacentric height for several

floating bodies.

13.5.3 Rig

There are three components of the experimental set-up:

1. A large pot (preferred in a cylinder shape) containing liquid (the liquid can be
   salt water, fresh water, oil, etc.),

2. scale,

3. a additional sand or liquid,

4. relatively smaller pot to be fitted into the first pot (thus it should be made from
   cylindrical shape or, at least, both can be any shape that fitted into each other
   proffered to be in a form that easy to calculate (or pre-calibrated) the volume),
   and,

5. and a metric balance to weigh the cylinders.

13.5.4 Procedure

   1. Measure the weigh of the small pot make it ws
   2. Place the small empty cylinder into the large vertical cylinder filled with liquid

       and observe stability (whether or not the cylinder is stable).

   3. Add a small amount of sand/liquid into the small cylinder and describe if the small
       cylinder is unstable. Measure the distance of the small cylinder is submerged, ho,
       and then measure the height of liquid/sand, hi.

   4. Continue adding sand until the small cylinder remains vertical, i.e., stable. Mea-
       sure the submerged amount of cylinder. (This is the stability boundary)

   5. Continue the process until the cylinder become stable again. Mark that point as
       the second stability boundary on the GM diagram or the stability diagram.

   6. Remove the small cylinder and measure its weight. Also measure the height of
       sand and record your results on the data sheet.

       as defined for ships.). What are the conditions that these cylinders for this to be
       true (hint, see the discussion about it in book). Is the cap at the cylinder end
