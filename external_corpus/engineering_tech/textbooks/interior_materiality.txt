                                      ula, moreover, access to up-to-date information
                                      on emerging technologies and trends is a key
                                      exigency for the contemporary designer. Accord-
                                      ingly, this book is authored to form a compre-

                                      The knowledge base presented here is not only
                                      useful in shaping spatial experience, ensuring
                                      occupant well-being, and employing sustainable
                                      thinking but also beneficial in managing budget

of spatial design, trends can be defined as
a specific color, material, or finish inspiring
collective attention and desirability for a period,
owing to exposure, popularity, or association.
Trends can be relevant for some contexts, such
as a trade expo stand or a retail space, whereas
in others not so much, such as a government
office or a history museum. For some types of
materials, such as fabrics and wallcoverings
trends are highly relevant. Oftentimes products
that were released around the same season
seem to resemble each other and companies
invest large amounts of money to track and
set trends. The designer needs to know about
existing trends and forecasts but also needs the
skill to manipulate user perception and generate
interest. For example, subway tiles are deemed
as classic and timeless by some but in a modern
interior, they can easily look dated. However, a
contemporary re-imagining of a subway tile with
an elegant finish might be a good nostalgic touch

referred to as the color or the hue of an object.
However, hue is different from color as hue
refers to a overarching category determined by
wavelength whereas color encompasses several
properties including hue as well as saturation,
value, etc., referring to the actual combined
wavelengths. For example red is hue and pink
is the color. In most sources, the primary colors
(red, blue, yellow) are referred to as hues, and
in others secondary (green, violet, orange) and
tertiary colors (blue-green, yellow-green, etc.)
are also included. The basic idea of hue is to
identify a color family by using a color with no
variation in saturation, shade, tint, or value,
intensity. There are various terms that define
the nuances of color further. Shade or tone
refers to the presence of black in a color or hue.
On the other hand, tint is the presence of white
in a color or a hue. Value is the overall degree
of lightness and darkness of a hue. Saturation
refers to the intensity of the hue, or oppositely
desaturation is the amount of gray perceived.

Plaster is a thick viscous material, a mixture
of gypsum, water, and sand that hardens as it
dries and becomes rigid and brittle. The mixture
can be referred to as mud. Gypsum plaster,
also known as plaster of Paris, uses gypsum
as a binder; it is comparatively more common.
This type of plaster is targeted towards interior
applications. Too much moisture exposure

warping and checking may occur depending on
lumbers position in the kiln. It is also possible
to utilize a combination of both. Surface mois-
ture content for solid wood has to be 6-9% for
interior use, and 9-14% for construction and
exterior use. For different regions, the average
equilibrium moisture content differs based on
relative humidity. Coastlines such as parts of
Florida and California (11%) demand higher
moisture content than inland areas (8%), and
then there are the arid areas such as parts of
Arizona, Nevada, and Utah (6%).

Wood responds to the relative humidity of the
environment, and while doing so the material
expands and shrinks. This should be considered
when specifying solid wood for various uses.
Seams, gaps, or kerfing can be provided to
accommodate movement, or miter joints might
be avoided with wood species that are more
susceptible to movement, such as beech or
birch.

    When joining wood from different sources
    (species, heartwood/sapwood, kiln/air

    ered that both will respond differently to
    moisture and dimensional change might

In order to enhance their properties, they are
often combined with synthetic fibers.

exposure and receive less traffic is important for
retaining the look in the long term.

Trim strips are used to cover the transition
between two different flooring applications to
prevent edge deterioration and to ensure a
clean finish. Any exposed carpet edge is more
susceptible to wear, and in the case of a carpet,
trim strips minimize fraying of the exposed
edges. Carpet shims are used to raise the
carpet application, for smoothly transitioning to
a thicker or higher floor finish, especially when
it is not practical to adjust the substrate height.

Due to a large number of gaps and crevices
between each pile and tuft, combined with the
electrostatic build-up, carpets not only attract
dirt but also hold onto it. This creates a constant
need for cleaning. Moreover, besides being
a detriment to indoor air quality, dirt and grit
abrade the fibers creating a faded look, espe-
cially for synthetic fibers. Aside from regular
vacuuming, periodic deep cleaning can be done
to attain a relatively clean carpet.

Shades feature a continuous fabric mounted on
a rolling mechanism. The fabric can be rolled
down to cover the window, though there are
bottom-up versions as well. Shades are very
useful in terms of filtering or partially allowing
sunlight and controlling glare. Some versions
of roller shades allow for varying the opacity by
aligning two layers of horizontally striped fabric.
Side leaks are a problem for shades as well.

Draperies are panels of loose fabric suspended
from a track or traversing rod. Sunlight, view,

the drapery to the sides of the window. Draper-

Even though contemporary textile manufacturers
are quite competent in terms of quality control,
it is imperative that all ordered fabrics should
be inspected under bright light for defects,
before starting the fabrication process. Even if
the fabric gets replaced without charge due to
a defect, the lost time and effort for fabricating
defective pieces can harm the overall project

Metalworking processes can be broadly catego-
rized into forming, cutting, and joining. Multiple
processes may be involved in the fabrication
of a single metal component. Metals can with-
stand plastic deformation before breaking,
thanks to their malleable and ductile nature.
This enables cold forming techniques such as
bending, rolling, extrusion, punching, stamping,
drawing, spinning, etc. to be utilized. Extruding
involves forcing metal through a shaped aper-
ture to achieve a lengthy component with the
desired profile. Large roller presses can shape
metal into a profile or flat plane. Metal fibers
can be drawn with a similar technique. Casting

chemical exposure to strong acids, chlorinated

considered. Longer exposure means stronger
staining and harder removal. However, thanks
to their homogeneous color-through constitution

tic laminate can be applied.
Plastic laminates can be used for countertops,
as long as the substrate's behavior against
moisture is stable. Plastic laminates have
size limitations, typically matching common
substrate sizes such as 4' by 8' or 6' by 12';
when there are turns, corners, or extended
areas involved a seam is needed. Typically,
these seams represent weak points on the
surface. The seam needs to be far away from
water sources and all edges need to be sealed.
In addition to moisture concerns, the designer
should be concerned about heat exposure as
well, as continual exposure to heat can cause
plastic laminates to delaminate especially at the
seams and edges.
High-pressure laminates (HPL) feature multi-
ple layers of kraft paper, impregnated with resin
consolidated via the application of high heat
and pressure. Compared to standard plastic
laminates they contain 3 to 4 times more layers,
providing extra durability and impact resistance.
Similar to standard plastic laminates, HPL's also
require a stable substrate. Compact laminates
feature a core that is completely consisting of
resin-impregnated kraft papers, sandwiched
between laminated sheets, via the application
of intense heat and pressure. Even though
slightly expensive, compact laminates are highly

                                        a contractor is an individual or a company that
                                        coordinates and supervises a project, develops
                                        a schedule, handles permit processes, acquires

                    first thing to understand before attempting any
                    field measurements is that no building is built
                    perfectly. There are always slight deviations
                    from the actual architectural drawings, whether
                    due to imperfect construction practices or
                    simply because the building settled over time.
                    Such deviations have the potential to affect
                    fabrication and installation processes, during
                    which mistakes and oversight can be very costly.

                    (12' x 8' = 96sqft), and a door opening (36" x        Wallpapers are typically cut into strips and then
                    84" or 3' x 7' = 21sqft). The total opening area
                    is 120 + 96 + 21 = 237sqft. This is the area that           Fig.12/07 Wallpaper roll length determines how many
                    won't be covered by any material. The actual                useful strips can be extracted as well as the wastage.
                    wall area to be covered is 1056sqft (assumed
                    total wall area) - 237sqft (minus the openings)
                    = 819sqft. The next step involves finding out the
                    total coverage needed based on the number of
                    paint coats. If the number of coats required is 3,
                    the total resulting area to be covered would be
                    819sqft x 3 = 2457sqft.

                    The last step involves dividing the coverage of the
                    material per unit by the total area to be covered.
                    In this case, the amount of coverage is given as

          SUSTAINABILITY CONCERNS

LIFE EXPECTANCY  When specifying a material, the
designer should always consider the expected
useful life of a material/product and the main-
tenance requirements to achieve the longest
possible service. The maintenance aspect is
important because one might expect a wood
countertop to last decades with good care.
