                 About this book

This book has two aims.

 The general aim is to help bridge the gap between school and university mathematics.
       You might wonder why such a gap exists. The reason is that mathematics is taught at school for
       various purposes: to improve numeracy; to hone problem-solving skills; as a service for students
       going on to study subjects that require some mathematical skills (economics, biology, engineering,
       chemistry -- the list is long); and, finally, to provide a foundation for the small number of students
       who will continue to a specialist mathematics degree. It is a very rare school that can achieve
       all this, and almost inevitably the course is least successful for its smallest constituency, future
       mathematics undergraduates.

 The more specific aim is to help you to prepare for STEP or other examinations required for uni-
       versity entrance in mathematics. To find out more about STEP, read the next section.

It used to be said that mathematics and cricket were not spectator sports; this is still true of mathematics.
To progress as a mathematician, you have to strengthen your mathematical muscles. It is not enough
just to read books or attend lectures. You have to work on problems yourself.
One way of achieving the first of the aims set out above is to work on the second, and that is how this
book is structured. It consists almost entirely of problems for you to work on.
The problems are all based on STEP questions. I chose the questions either because they are `nice'--
in the sense that you should get a lot of pleasure from tackling them (I did), or because I felt I had
something interesting to say about them.
The first two problems (the `worked problems') are in a stream of consciousness format. They are in-
tended to give you an idea of how a trained mathematician would think when tackling them. This
approach is much too long-winded to sustain for the remainder of the book, but it should help you to
see what sort of questions you ought to be asking yourself as you work on the later problems.
Each subsequent problem occupies two pages. On the first page is the STEP question, followed by a
comment. The comments may contain hints, they may direct your attention to key points, and they may
include more general discussions. On the next page is a solution; you have to turn over, so that your eye
cannot accidentally fall on a key line of working. The solutions give enough working for you to be able
to read them through and pick up at least the gist of the method; they may not give all the details of the
calculations. For each problem, the given solution is of course just one way of producing the required
result: there may be many other equally good or better ways. Finally, if there is space on the page after
the solution (which is sometimes not the case, especially if diagrams have to be fitted in), there is a
postmortem. The postmortems may indicate what aspects of the solution you should be reviewing and
they may tell you about the ideas behind the problems.
I hope that you will use the comments and solutions as springboards rather than feather beds. You will
only really benefit from this book if you have a good go at each problem before looking at the comment
and certainly before looking at the solution. The problems are chosen so that there is something for
you to learn from each one, and this will be lost to you for ever if you simply read the solution without
thinking about the problem on your own.
x Advanced Problems in Mathematics

I have given each problem a difficulty rating ranging from  to . Difficulty in mathematics is in the
eye of the beholder: you might find a question difficult simply because you overlooked some key step,
which on another day you would not have hesitated over. You should not therefore be discouraged if
you are stuck on a -question, though you should probably be encouraged if you get through one of
the rare -questions without mishap.
This book is about depth not breadth. I have not tried to teach you any new topics. Instead, I want to lead
you towards a deeper understanding of the material you already know. I therefore restricted myself to
problems requiring knowledge of the specific and rather limited syllabus that is laid out at the end of this
book. This syllabus is for STEP papers that were set before 2019, for 2019 onwards there are new STEP
specifications which can be found at www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/step/about-step.

Calculators are not required for any of the problems in this book and calculators are not permitted in
STEP examinations. In the early days of STEP, calculators were permitted but they were not required for
any question. It was found that candidates who tried to use calculators sometimes ended up missing
the point of the question or getting a silly answer. My advice is to remove the battery so that you are not
tempted.

I started this section by listing the aims of the book. You may have noticed that teaching you mathemat-
ics is not one of them. I can't remember where I heard the following rather nice analogy. In 1464, a huge
block of Carrara marble was carefully chosen from a quarry in Tuscany and transported to Florence,
where it lay almost untouched for many years. In 1501 it was given to the sculptor Michelangelo. He
worked hard on it, chipping away and chipping away for three years, until at last, inside the block, he
found a beautiful statue of David. You can see a picture at:
http://www.accademia.org/explore-museum/artworks/michelangelos-david/

And the analogy? I can't teach you mathematics with this book, but I believe that much hard work on
your part, chipping away at the problems, will eventually reveal the mathematician that is within you.

I hope you enjoy using this book as much as I have enjoyed putting it together.
                         STEP

What is STEP?

STEP (Sixth Term Examination Paper) is an examination used by Cambridge University as part of its
procedure for admitting students to study mathematics. Applicants are interviewed in December, and
may then be offered a place conditional on the results of their public examinations (A-level, International
Baccalaureate, etc) and STEP. The examinations are sat in June and offers are confirmed in August when
all the examination results are available.
STEP is used for conditional offers not just by Cambridge, but also by Warwick University as part of
a range of offers, and to a lesser extent by some other English universities. Many other university
mathematics departments recommend that their applicants practise the past papers even if they do not
take the examination. In 2019, more than 4500 scripts were marked, compared to about 500 students
holding STEP offers from Cambridge.
The first STEPs were taken in 1987, and there were specimen papers before that from which some of the
questions in this book are drawn. At that time, there were STEPs in many subjects but by 2001 only the
mathematics papers remained. The examination has remained more or less stable over more than 30
years: it has not been blown about by the various fads in the public examination systems that came and
went during that time.
I do not want you to think that this book is about examinations; and it is definitely not about how to
pass examinations. But since all the questions are taken from STEP papers, I will say a little more about
STEP.
There are three STEP papers, 1, 2 and 3, in increasing order of difficulty. More information about STEP,
including past papers and up-to-date specifications can be found at www.admissionstesting.org/for-
test-takers/step/about-step. The specifications for STEP contain Pure Mathematics, Mechanics and
Probability/Statistics.
It has to be said, though, that the statistics questions are very likely to require knowledge of probability
rather than statistics (for example, there are very few questions on statistical tests of given data). This
is because the underlying theory of statistics is quite difficult, and therefore unsuitable for examination
at this level, whereas the application of statistical tests is rather routine and therefore unsuitable for
different reasons.

What is the purpose of STEP?

From the point of view of admissions to a university mathematics course, STEP has three purposes.

 It is used as a hurdle for entrance to university mathematics courses, and sometimes for other
       mathematics-based courses. There is strong evidence that success in STEP correlates very well
       with university examination results.1

1 Recent studies comparing rank in STEP with rank in first-year Cambridge mathematics examinations reveal a Spearman corre-
   lation coefficient of 0.63, which is very high in comparison with other predictors of university examination results.
2 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

 It acts as preparation for the university course, because the style of mathematics found in STEP
       questions is similar to that of undergraduate mathematics.

 It tests motivation. It is important to prepare for STEP (by working through old papers, for ex-
       ample), which can require considerable dedication. Those who are willing to make the effort are
       more likely to thrive on a difficult university mathematics course.

STEP vs A-level

A-level2 tests mathematical knowledge and technique by asking you to tackle fairly stereotyped prob-
lems. STEP asks you to apply the same knowledge and technique to problems that are, ideally, unfamil-
iar.

Here is an A-level question, in which you follow the instructions in the question:

        By using the substitution u = 2x - 1, or otherwise, find
                                                                 
                                                                          2x dx.
                                                                     (2x - 1)2

And here, for comparison, is a STEP question, which requires both competence in basic mathematical
techniques and mathematical intuition. Note that help is given for the first integral, so that everyone
starts at the same level. Then, for the second integral, candidates have to show that they understand
why the substitution used in the first part worked, and how it can be adapted.

Use the substitution x = 2 - cos  to evaluate the integral
                                                        2 ( x - 1 )21
                                                                            dx.
                                                         3/2 3 - x

Show that, for a < b,   q ( x - a )21                           
                                               (b - a)( + 3 3 - 6)
                                         dx =                                    ,
                       p b-x                   12

where p = (3a + b)/4 and q = (a + b)/2.

The differences between STEP and A-level are:

1. STEP questions are much longer.

2. STEP questions are much less routine.

3. STEP questions may require considerable dexterity in performing mathematical manipulations.

4. Individual STEP questions may require knowledge of several different areas of mathematics (espe-
       cially the mechanics and statistics questions, which will often require advanced pure mathematical
       techniques).

5. The marks available for each part of the question are not disclosed on the paper.

6. There is a lot of choice on STEP papers (Candidates are expected to attempt 6 questions out of 11
       or 12).

2 I use the term `A-level' here as a shorthand for a typical school mathematics examination. The particular examinations you take
   may well be very different in style and format but, even if that is the case, I am sure some of what follows will strike a chord
   with you.

These differences matter, because in mathematics more than in any other subject it is very important to
match the difficulty of the question with the ability of the candidates. For example, you could reason-
ably set the question `Was Henry VIII a good king?' on a lower-school history paper, an A-level paper,
or as a PhD topic. The answers would (or should) differ according to the level. On mathematics exami-
nation papers, the question has to be tailored to the expected level in order to discriminate between the
candidates: if it is too easy, nearly all candidates will score very high marks; if it is too hard, nearly all
candidates will make little progress on any of the questions.

STEP vs Olympiad

STEP questions are not like A-level questions, as we have seen, but they are not like Olympiad questions
either. Typically, an Olympiad question comes with no `scaffolding' (as it is nowadays called) at all.
There are no little hints or toe-holds to allow you to find a way into the problem. A typical STEP
question (see the next section) does come with a bit of scaffolding; it is more of a learning process. You
could say that it is more about the journey than about the arrival.

STEP Questions

STEP questions do not fall into any one category. Typically, there will be a range of types on each of the
papers. Here are some thoughts, in no particular order.

 My favourite sort of question is in two (or maybe more) parts: in the first part, you are asked to
       perform some unfamiliar task and are told how to do it (integration using a given substitution, or
       expressing a quartic as the algebraic sum of two squares, for example); for the later parts, you are
       expected to demonstrate that you have understood and learned from the first part by applying the
       method to a new and perhaps more complicated task.

 Another favourite of mine is the question which has different answers according to the value of a
       certain number (or parameter). A common example involves sketching a graph whose shape de-
       pends on whether a parameter is positive or negative. Ideally, the different values of the parameter
       are not given in the question, and you have to identify them for yourself.

 Another good type of question requires you to do some preliminary special-case work and then
       prove a general result.

 In another type, you have to show that you can understand and use new notation or a new theo-
       rem.

 Questions with several unrelated parts (for example, three integrals using different techniques)
       are generally avoided; but if they occur, there tends to be a `sting in the tail' involving putting all
       the parts together in some way.

 Some questions do not rely on any part of the syllabus: instead they might require `common sense',
       involving counting or seeing patterns, or they might involve some aspect of more elementary
       mathematics with an unusual slant. Such questions try to test capacity for clear and logical thought
       without using much mathematical knowledge (like the calendar question mentioned in the section
       on preparation below, or questions concerning islands populated by toads `who always tell the
       truth' and frogs `who always fib').
4 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

 Some questions are devised to check that you do not simply apply routine methods blindly. For
       example, a function might have a maximum value at the end of the interval upon which it is
       defined, even though its derivative might be non-zero there. Finding the maximum in such a case
       is not simply a question of routine differentiation.

 There are always questions specifically on integration or differentiation, and many others (includ-
       ing mechanics and probability) that use calculus as a means to an end.

 Graph-sketching is regarded by mathematicians as a fundamental skill and there are nearly always
       questions that require a sketch.

 Basic ideas from analysis, such as
                                                                        b

                                             0  f (x)  k  0  f (x)dx  (b - a)k

                                                                                                         a

       or
                                                  f (x) > 0  f (b) > f (a) for b > a

       or the relationship between an integral and a sum often come up, though knowledge of such
       results is never assumed -- candidates may be told that they can use the result without proof, or a
       sketch `proof' may be requested.

 As mentioned above, questions on statistical tests are rare, because questions that require real
       understanding (rather than `cookbook' methods) tend to be too difficult. More often, the questions
       in the Probability and Statistics section are about probability.

 The mechanics questions normally require a firm understanding of the basic principles (when to
       apply conservation of momentum and energy, for example) and may well involve a differential
       equation. Projectile questions are often set, but are never routine.

Advice to candidates

First appearances

I am often asked whether STEP is `difficult'. Of course, it depends on what is meant by `difficult'; it is
not difficult compared with the mathematics I do every day. But to be on the safe side, I always answer
`yes' before explaining further.
Your first impression on looking at a STEP paper is likely to be that it does indeed look very difficult.
Don't be discouraged! Its difficult appearance is largely due to it being very different in style from what
you are used to.
At the time of writing, a typical A-level examination lasts between 90 mins and two hours and contains
between 7 and 13 questions. That is about 10 minutes per question. If you are considering studying
mathematics at a top university, it is likely that you will manage to do them all and get them nearly
all right in the time available. A STEP examination lasts 3 hours, and you are only supposed to do
six questions. This means that each question is designed to take about 30 minutes. If you compare a
10-minute question with a 30-minute question, the 30-minute question will look substantially harder.
When looking through past papers you may be put off by the number of different topics covered on the
paper. Before the 2017-18 A-level reforms there was a considerable amount of variation in the different
specifications of each examination board, and STEP was designed to provide sufficient questions for all
of those specifications. From the summer of 2019 onwards there is a lot less variation (for the pure topics
                                                                                                                    Stephen Siklos 5

at least). Also, you get to chose which questions to do so you do not have to be overly concerned about
the inclusion of some topics you are less fond of.
Once you get used to the idea that STEP is very different from A-level, it becomes much less daunting.

Preparation

The best preparation for STEP (apart, of course, from working through this excellent book) is to work
slowly through past papers.3 Hints and answers are available for the more recent years, but you should
use these with discretion: doing a question with hints and answers in front of you is nothing like doing
it yourself, and you may well miss the whole point of the question (which is to make you think about
mathematics). In general, thinking about the problem is much more important than getting the answer.
It is worth emphasising that there is no `hidden agenda': a candidate who does two complete probability
questions and two complete mechanics questions will obtain the same mark and grade as one who does
four complete pure questions. Similarly a candidate who scores 15 on each of 4 questions will get the
same grade as one who scores 10 on each of 6 questions.
Just as the examiners have no hidden agenda concerning question choice, so they have no hidden
agenda concerning your method of answering the question. If you can get to the end of a question
correctly you will get full marks whatever method you use.4 Some years ago one of the questions asked
candidates to find the day of the week of a given date (say, the 5th of June 1905). A candidate who
simply counted backwards day by day from the date of the exam would have received full marks for
that question (but would not have had time to do any other questions).
You may be worried that the examiners expect some mysterious thing called rigour. Do not worry: STEP
is an exam for schools, not universities, and the examiners understand the difference. Nevertheless, it is
extremely important that you present ideas clearly, and show working at all stages.

Presentation

You should set out your answer legibly and logically (don't scribble down the first thought that comes
into your head)--this not only helps you to avoid silly mistakes but also signals to the examiner that
you know what you are doing (which can be effective even if you haven't the foggiest idea what you
are doing). It helps if you can read your own writing; be sure that you can distinguish between `2' and
`z' and `5' and `s'.
Examiners are not as concerned with neatness as you might fear. However, if you receive complaints
from your teachers that your answers are difficult to follow then you should listen.5 Remember that
more space usually means greater legibility. Try writing on alternate lines (this leaves a blank line for
corrections).
Try to read your answers with a hostile eye. Have you made it clear when you have come to the end of

3 These and the other publications mentioned below are obtainable from the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing
   website www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/step/about-step. You may also find the STEP Support Programme
   (maths.org/step) useful. This has been developed by the University of Cambridge to help students prepare for STEP.

4 Though you must obey instructions in the question: for example, if it says `Hence prove ...', then you must use the previous
   result in your proof. One example is 2018 STEP 3 question 5 which asked candidates to deduce the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric
   Mean inequality. Those candidates who did not `deduce' this from previous work did not do as well.

5 Begin rant: I am very surprised at the scrappy and illegible work that I receive from a few of my students. It seems so dis-
   respectful to expect me to spend ages trying to decipher their work when they could have spent a little more time making it
   presentable, for example by copying it out neatly or writing more slowly. Why is my time less important than theirs? End rant.
6 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

a particular argument? Try underlining your conclusions. Have you explained what you are trying to
do? For example, if a question asks `Is A true?' try beginning your answer by writing `A is true'--if you
think that it is true--so that the examiner knows which way your argument leads. If you used an idea
(for example, integration by substitution), did you tell the examiner that this is what you were doing?
You may find that you stop a question and then restart it later--in which case a note to the examiner
`continued later in booklet' will make your solution easier to follow. Also, if you decide to cross out
some working do it neatly (for example by putting one diagonal line through it) as then you have the
option of writing `please mark this' if you change your mind.

What to do if you cannot get started on a problem

Try the following, in order:

 Reread the question to check that you understand what is wanted.

 Reread the question to look for clues - the way it is phrased, or the way a formula is written, or
       other relevant aspects of the question. (You may think that the setters are trying to set difficult
       questions or to catch you out. Usually, nothing could be further from the truth: they are probably
       doing all in their power to make it easy for you by trying to tell you what to do).

 Try to work out exactly what it is that you don't understand.

 Simplify the notation - for example, by writing out sums explicitly.

 Look at special cases (choose special values which simplify the problem) in order to try to under-
       stand why a result is true.

 Write down your thoughts - in particular, try to express the exact reason why you are stuck.

 Go on to another question and go back later.

 If you are preparing for the examination (but not in the actual examination!) take a short break.6

 Discuss it with a friend or teacher (again, better not do this in the actual examination) or consult
       the hints and answers, but make sure you still think it through yourself.
       BUT REMEMBER: following someone else's solution is not remotely the same thing as doing the
       problem yourself. Once you have seen someone else's solution to a problem, then you are de-
       prived, for ever, of much of the benefit that could have come from working it out yourself.
       Even if, ultimately, you get stuck on a particular problem, you derive vastly more benefit from
       seeing a solution to something with which you have already struggled, than by simply following
       a solution to something to which you've given very little thought.

What if a problem isn't coming out?

If you have got started but the answer doesn't seem to be coming out, then try the following:

6 J. E. Littlewood (1885-1977), distinguished Cambridge mathematician and author of the highly entertaining A Mathematician's
   Miscellany (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986) used to work seven days a week until an experiment revealed that
   when he took Sundays off, the good ideas had a way of coming on Mondays.
                                                                                                                    Stephen Siklos 7

 Check your algebra. In particular, make sure that what you have written works in special cases.
       For example: if you have written the series for log(1 + x) as

                                                        1 - x + 12 x2 - 13 x3 +   

       then a quick check will reveal that it doesn't work for x = 0; clearly, the 1 should not be there.7
       A note on the subject of algebra. In many of the problems in this book, the algebra is quite stiff:
       you have to go through many lines of calculation before you get to an expression recognisably
       close to your target. Really, the only way to manage this efficiently is to check each line carefully
       before going on the next line. Otherwise, you can waste hours.8

 Make sure that what you have written makes sense. For example, in a problem which is dimen-
       sionally consistent, you cannot add x (with dimension length, say) to x2 or to exp x (which itself
       does not make sense -- the argument of exp has to be dimensionless). Even if there are no dimen-
       sions in the problem, it is often possible to mentally assign dimensions and hence enable a quick
       check.
       Be wary of applying familiar processes to unfamiliar objects (very easy to do when you are feeling
       at sea): for example, it is all too easy, if you are not sure where your solution is going, to solve the
       vector equation a.x = 1 by dividing both sides by vector a; a bad idea.

 Analyse exactly what you are being asked to do. Try to understand the hints, explicit and implicit.
       Remember to distinguish between terms such as explain/prove/define/etc. (There is essentially
       no difference between `prove' and `show': the former tends to be used in more formal situations,
       but if you are asked to `show' something, a proper proof is required.)

 Remember that different parts of a question are often linked. There may be guidance in the nota-
       tion and choice of names of variables in the question.

 If you get irretrievably stuck in the exam, state in words what you are trying to do and move on
       (at A-level, you don't get credit for merely stating intentions, but STEP examiners are generally
       grateful for any sign of intelligent life).

What to do after completing a question

It is a natural instinct to consider that you have finished with a question once you have got to an answer.
However this instinct should be resisted both from a general mathematical point of view and from the
much narrower view of preparing for an examination. Instead, when you have completed a question
you should stop for a few minutes and think about it. Here is a check list for you to run through:

 Look back over what you have done, checking that the arguments are correct and making sure that
       they work for any special cases you can think of. It is surprising how often a chain of completely
       spurious arguments and gross algebraic blunders leads to the given answer.

 Check that your answer is reasonable. For example if the answer is a probability p then you should
       check that 0  p  1. If your answer depends on an integer n, does it behave as it should when
       n  ? Is it dimensionally correct?

7 Another check will reveal that for very small positive x, log is positive (since its argument is bigger than 1) whereas the series
   is negative (once the 1 has been removed), so there is clearly something else wrong.

8 Which is what I normally do; but I am still hoping to heed my own advice in the not-too-distant future.
8 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

       If, in the exam, you find that your answer is not reasonable, but you don't have time to do anything
       about it, then write a brief phrase showing that you understand that your answer is unreasonable
       (for example `This is wrong because mass must be positive'). It may be that your time will be more
       profitably spent doing another question than hunting for a sign error.
 Check that you have used all the information given. In many ways the most artificial aspect of
       examination questions is that you are given exactly the amount of information required to answer
       the question. If your answer does not use everything you are given then either it is wrong or you
       are faced with a very unusual examination question.
 Check that you have understood the point of the question. It is, of course, the case that not all
       exam questions have a point, but many do. What idea did the examiners want you to have?
       Which techniques did they want you to demonstrate? Is the result of the question interesting in
       some way? Does it generalise? If you can see the point of the question would your working show
       the point to someone who did not know it in advance?
 Make sure that you are not unthinkingly applying mathematical tools which you do not fully
       understand.9
 As preparation for the examination, make sure that you actually understand not only what you
       have done, but also why you have done it that way rather than some other way. This is particularly
       important if you have had to use a hint or solution.
 If the question has associated hints, answers or examiner's reports then it is a good idea to read
       these to see what the common approaches and pitfalls were.
 In the examination, check that you have given the detail required. There often comes a point in a
       question where, if we could show that A implies B, then the result follows. If, after a lot of thought,
       you suddenly see that A does indeed imply B the natural thing to do is to write triumphantly `But
       A implies B so the result follows'10. Unfortunately, unscrupulous individuals (not you, of course)
       who have no idea why A should imply B (apart from the fact that it would complete the question)
       could, and do, write the exactly the same thing. Go back through the major points of the question
       making sure that you have written enough for the examiner to be able to follow your reasoning.

9 Mathematicians should feel as insulted as engineers by the following joke.
   A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer enter a mathematics contest, the first task of which is to prove that all odd
   numbers are prime. The mathematician has an elegant argument: `1's a prime, 3's a prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime. Therefore,
   by mathematical induction, all odd numbers are prime. It's the physicist's turn: `1's a prime, 3's a prime, 5's a prime, 7's a
   prime, 11's a prime, 13's a prime, so, to within experimental error, all odd numbers are prime.' The most straightforward proof
   is provided by the engineer: `1's a prime, 3's a prime, 5's a prime, 7's a prime, 9's a prime, 11's a prime . . . '.

10 There is an old anecdote about the distinguished Professor X. In the middle of a lecture she writes `It is obvious that A', suddenly
   falls silent and after a few minutes she rubs it out and walks out of the room. The awed students hear her pacing up and down
   outside. Then after twenty minutes she returns and writes `It is obvious that A' and continues the lecture.

First thoughts

When I play tennis and I see a ball that I think I can hit, I rush up to it and smack it into the net. This is
a tendency I try to overcome when I am doing mathematics. In this question, for example, even though
I'm pretty sure that I can find f (x), I'm going to pause for a moment before I do so. I am going to use
the pause to think about two things.

 I'm going to think about what to do when I have found f (x).

 I'm going to try to decide what the question is really about.

Of course, I may not be able to decide what to do with f (x) until I actually see what it looks like, and I
may not be able to see what the question is really about until I have finished it--maybe not even then--
some questions are not really about anything in particular. I am also going to use the pause to think a bit
about the best way of performing the differentiation. Should I simplify first? Should I make some sort
of substitution? Clearly, knowing how to tackle the rest of the question might guide me in deciding the
best way to do the differentiation. Or it may turn out that the differentiation is fairly straightforward, so
that it doesn't matter how I do it.
Two more points occur to me as I re-read the question:

 I notice that the inequalities are not strict (they are  rather than >). Am I going to have to worry
       about the difference?

 I also notice that there is an `If ... then', and I wonder if this is going to cause me trouble. I will
       need to be careful to get the implication the right way round. I mustn't try to prove that if f (x)  0
       then a  9/8.
       It will be interesting to see why the implication is only one way--why it is not an `if and only if'
       question. It may be just `if' because `only if' isn't true; or it may be just `if' because the examiners
       thought that the question was long enough without the `only if'.

Don't turn over until you have spent a little time thinking along these lines.
12 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Doing the question

Looking ahead, it is clear that the real hurdle is going to be showing that f (x)  0. How am I going to do
that? Two ways suggest themselves. First, if f (x) turns out to be a quadratic function, or an obviously
positive multiple of a quadratic function, I should be able to use some standard method: looking at the
discriminant (`b2 - 4ac'), etc; or, better, completing the square. But if f (x) is not of this form, I will have
to think of something else: maybe I will have to sketch a graph.

I've just noticed that f is an odd function, i.e. f (x) = -f (-x). (Did you notice that?) That is helpful,
because it means that f (x) is an even function.11 If it had been odd, there could have been a difficulty,
because all odd functions (at least, those with no vertical asymptotes) cross the horizontal axis y = 0 at
least once and cannot therefore be positive for all x.

Now, how should I do the differentiation? I could divide out the fraction, giving

                                                      x3              x
                                                1 + x2 = x - 1 + x2

and                                                          x                  x

                             f (x) = (a - 1)x + 1 + x2 = bx + 1 + x2 , ()

where I have set b = a - 1 to save writing. (Is this right? I'll just check that it works when x = 2. Yes, it

does:  f (2)  =  2a -  8  =  2(a - 1) +  25 .)  This  might  save  a  bit  of  writing,  but  I  don't  at  the  moment  see  it
                       5

helping me towards a positive function. On balance, I think I'll stick with the original form.

Another thought: should I differentiate the fraction using the quotient formula or should I write it as
x3(1 + x2)-1 and use the product rule? I doubt if there is much in it. I never normally use the quotient
rule--it's just extra baggage to carry around. But on this occasion, since the final form I am looking for
is a single fraction and the denominator using the quotient rule is a square and therefore non-negative,
I will.

One more thought: since I am trying to obtain an inequality, I must be careful throughout not to cancel
any quantity which might be negative; or at least if I do cancel a negative quantity, I must remember to
reverse the inequality.

Here goes (at last):

                             f (x) = a -                  3x2(1 + x2) - 2x(x3)

                                                                      22
                                                             (1 + x )

                                                   a + (2a - 3)x2 + (a - 1)x4
                                                = (1 + x2)2 .

I had to do a bit of algebra to obtain the second equation.

This is working out as I had hoped: the denominator is certainly positive and the numerator is a
quadratic function of x2. I can finish this off most elegantly by completing the square. There are two
ways of doing this. Just to be clear in my mind, I'm going to write the numerator as

                                                      A + Bx2 + Cx4 ,

where A = a, B = 2a - 3 and C = a - 1. Then I can complete the square in two ways:
                                           A(1 + (B/2A)x2))2 + (C - B2/4A)x4

or ( 2 )2 ( 2 )                                                                                                          ()
                                         C x + B/2C) + A - B /4C .

11 You can see this easily by sketching a `typical' odd function, or by differentiating the Maclaurin expansion of an odd function.

It doesn't seem to matter which I use. The second expression () looks a bit simpler.
If a  98 , then certainly C > 0. That means that the first of the two terms of () is positive:
C(x2 + B/2C)2 > 0.

The second term of () can be written in terms of a as follows:

                                            A - B2/4C = a - (2a - 3)2
                                                                      4(a - 1)

                                                                4a(a - 1) - (2a - 3)2
                                                             = 4(a - 1)
                                                             = 8a - 9 . ()

                                                                4(a - 1)

It is very pleasing to see the numerator 8a - 9; it is exactly what I want, because it is non-negative if
a  98 . That is what I needed to complete the question.

Post-mortem

Now I can look back and analyse what I have done.

On the technical side, it seems I was right not to use the simplified form of x3/(1 + x2) given in (). This
would have lead to the quadratic (b + 1) + (2b - 1)x2 + bx4, which isn't any easier to handle than the
quadratic involving a and just gives an extra opportunity to make an algebraic error.

Although introducing new variables A, B and C seemed at first to complicate the problem, it was useful
to have them when it came to completing the square, which would have been a bit of a mess had I
worked directly from the quartic expression with a in it.

Actually, I see on re-reading my solution that I have made a bit of a meal out of the ending. I needn't
have completed the square at all; I could have used the inequality a  9/8 immediately after finding
f (x), since a appears in f (x) with a plus sign always:

                     a + (2a - 3)x2 + (a - 1)x4 98 + ( 94 - 3)x2 + ( 98 - 1)x4 (x2 - 3)2
            f (x) =                                       =  2 2 0
                                          22    22
                               (1 + x )         (1 + x )     8(1 + x )

as required.

However, my unnecessarily elaborate proof, involving completing the square, makes the role of a a bit

clearer than it is in the shorter alternative. In fact, I can see how to answer my question about `if and

only if', namely, is it the case that f (x)  0 for all x if and only if a  98 ? The answer is: Yes. Looking
at (), I see that if f (x)  0 for all x, then certainly C  0, otherwise for large enough x the first (squared)
term would be dominant and negative. But if 0  C < 18 , then B < 0 and there is a value of x2 for which

the squared term in () vanishes, leaving only the second term which is negative, as can be seen from

(). That means f (x) < 0 for this value of x, contradicting our assumption. Therefore, f (x)  0 for all

x  implies  that  C    1  and  a    98 .
                       8

I wonder why the examiner wanted me to investigate the sign of f (x). The obvious reason is to see

what the graph looks like. We can now see what this question is about. It is clear that the examiners

really wanted to set the question: `Sketch the graphs of the function ax - x3/(1 + x2) in the different

cases that arise according to the value of a' but it was thought too long or difficult. It is worth looking

back over my working to see what can be said about the shape of the graph of f (x) when a < 9/8 .

(I leave that to you to think about!)

The n positive numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn, where n  3, satisfy      1999 Paper I

           x1 = 1 + 1 , x2 = 1 + 1 , . . . , xn-1 = 1 + 1 ,
                               x2  x3                           xn

and also                           xn = 1 + 1 .
Show that                                       x1

(i) x1, x2, . . . , xn > 1,

(ii) x1 - x2 = - x2 - x3 ,
                         x2x3

(iii) x1 = x2 =    = xn .

Hence find the value of x1.

First thoughts

My first thought is that this question has an unknown number of variables: x1, . . . , xn. That makes it
seem rather complicated. I might, if necessary, try to understand the result by choosing an easy value
for n (maybe n = 3). If I manage to prove some of the results in this special case, I will certainly go back
to the general case: doing the special case might help me tackle the general case, but I don't expect to
get many marks in an exam if I just prove the result in one special case.
Next, I see that the question has three sub-parts, then a final one. The final one begins `Hence ...'. This
means that I must use at least one of the previous parts in my working for the final part. It is not clear
from the structure of the question whether the three sub-parts are independent; the proof of (ii) and (iii)
may require the previous result(s), or it may not.
Actually, I think I can see how to do the very last part. If I assume that (iii) holds, so that x1 = x2 =
   = xn = x (say), then each of the equations given in the question is identical and each gives a simple
equation for x.
It is surprising, isn't it, that the final result doesn't depend on the value of n? That makes the idea of
choosing n = 3, just to see what is going on, quite attractive, but I'm not going to resort to that idea
unless I get very stuck.
The notation in part (i) is a bit odd. I'm not sure that I have seen anything like it before.12 But it can only
mean that each of the variables x1, x2, . . . xn is greater than 1.
In fact, now I think about it, I am puzzled about part (i). How can an inequality help to derive the
equalities in the later parts? I can think of a couple of ways in which the result xi > 1 could be used. One
is that I may need to cancel, say, x1 from both sides of an equation in which case I would need to know
that x1 = 0. But looking back at the question, I see I already know that x1 > 0 (it is given right at the

12 It is just the sort of thing that is used in university texts; but I'm not sure that it would be used in STEP papers nowadays.
16 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

start of the question), so this cannot be the right answer. Maybe I need to cancel some other factor, such
as (x1 - 1). Another possibility is that I get two or more solutions by putting x1 = x2 =    = xn = x
and I need the one with x > 1. This may be the answer: looking back at the question again, I see that
it asks for the value of x1 -- so I am looking for a single value. I'm still puzzled, but I will remember to
keep a sharp look out for ways of using part (i).

One more thing strikes me about the question. The equations satisfied by the xi are given on two lines
(`and also'). This could be for typographic reasons (the equations would not all fit on one line), but more
likely it is to make sure that I have noticed that the last equation is a bit different: all the other equations
relate xi to xi+1, whereas the last equation relates xn to x1. It goes back to the beginning, completing the
cycle. I'm pleased that I thought of this, because this circularity must be important.

Doing the question

I think I will do the very last part first, and see what happens.

Suppose, assuming the result of part (iii), that x1 = x2 =    = xn = x. Then substituting into any of the

equations given in the question gives

                                       x=1+ 1
                                                  x

i.e. x2 - x - 1 = 0. Using the quadratic formula gives

                                                  
                                       x= 1 5,

                                                 2

which does indeed give two answers (despite the fact that the question asks for just one). However, I
see that one is negative and can therefore be eliminated by the condition xi > 0 which was given in the
question (not, I note, the condition x1 > 1 from part (i); I still have to find a use for this).

I needed only part (iii) to find x1, so I expect that either I need both (i) and (ii) directly to prove (iii), or I
need (i) to prove (ii), and (ii) to prove (iii).

Now that I have remembered that xi > 0 for each i, I see that part (i) is obvious. Since x2 > 0 then
1/x2 > 0 and the first equation given in the question, x1 = 1 + 1/x2 , shows immediately that x1 > 1
and the same applies to x2, x3, etc.

Now what about part (ii)? The given equation involves x1, x2 and x3, so clearly I must use the first two

equations given in the question:

                                       x1 = 1 + 1 , x2 = 1 + 1 .
                                       x2                          x3

Since I want x1 - x2, I will see what happens if I subtract the two equations:

x1 - x2 = (1 + 1 ) - (1 + 1 ) = 1 - 1 i = x3 - x2 = - x2 - x3 . ()
                                  x2   x3 x2 x3                        x2x3     x2x3

That seems to work!
One idea that I haven't used so far is what I earlier called the circularity of the equations: the way that
xn links back to x1. I'll see what happens if I extend the above result. Since there is nothing special about
x1 and x2, the same result must hold if I add 1 to each of the suffices:

                                                       x2 - x3 = x3 - x4 .
                                                                        x3x4

I see that I can combine this with the previous result:

                                  x1 - x2 = - x2 - x3 = 2 x3 - x4 .
                                           x2x3          x2x3x4
                                                                                 Stephen Siklos 17

I now see where this is going. The above step can be repeated to give

      x1 - x2 = 2 x3 - x4 = - 2 2 x4 - x5 =   
                                               x2x3x4  x2x3x4x5

and eventually I will get back to x1 - x2:

      x4 - x5                                             x1 - x2
      x1 - x2 = - 2 2 =    =  2 2 2 2 2
      x2x3x4x5                                            x2x3x4x5 . . . xnx1x2

i.e.                                        (          1            )

      (x1 - x2) 1  2 2 2 2 2 2 = 0 .
                                               x1x2x3x4x5 . . . xn

I have put in a  because each step introduces a minus sign and I'm not sure yet whether the final sign
should be (-1)n or (-1)n-1. I can check this later (for example, by working out one simple case such as
n = 3); but I may not need to.
I deduce from this last equation that either

                                                     x12x22x32x42x52 . . . xn2 = 1

or
                                                               x1 = x2

(which is what I want). At last I see where to use part (i): I know that

                                                     x12x22x32x42x52 . . . xn2 = 1

because x1 > 1, x2 > 1, etc. Thus the only possibility is x1 = x2. Since there was nothing special about
x1 and x2, I deduce further that x2 = x3, and so on, as required.

Post-mortem

There were a number of useful points in this question:

1. The first point concerns using the information given in the question. The process of teasing infor-
       mation from what is given is fundamental to the whole of mathematics. It is very important to
       study what is given (especially seemingly unimportant conditions, such as xi > 0) to see why it
       has been given. If you find you reach the end of a question without apparently using some given
       information, then you should look back over your work: it is very unlikely that a condition has
       been given that is not used in some way. It may not be a necessary condition -- and we will see
       that the condition xi > 0 is not, in a sense, necessary in this question -- but it should be sufficient.
       The other piece of information in the question which you might easily have overlooked is the use
       of the singular rather than the plural in referring to the solution (` ... find the value of ...'), implying
       that there is just one value, despite the fact that the final equation is quadratic.

2. The second point concerns the structure of the question. Here, the position of the word `Hence'
       suggested strongly that none of the separate parts were stand-alone results; each had to be used
       for a later proof. Understanding this point made the question much easier, because I was always
       on the look out for an opportunity to use the earlier parts. Of course, in some problems (without
       that `hence') some parts may be stand-alone; though this is rare in STEP questions.

       You may think that this is like playing a game according to hidden (STEP) rules, but that is not the
       case. Precision writing and precision reading is vital in mathematics and in many professions (law,
       for example). Mathematicians have to be good at it, which is the reason why so many employers
       want to recruit people with mathematical training.
18 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

3. The third point was the rather inconclusive speculation about the way inequalities might help to
       derive an equality. It turned out that what was actually required was x1x2 . . . xn = 1. I was
       a bit puzzled by this possibility in my first thoughts, because it seemed that the result ought to
       hold under conditions different from those given; for example, xi < 0 for all i (does this condition
       work??). Come to think of it, why are conditions given on all xi when they are all related by the
       given equations? This makes me think that there ought to be a better way of proving the result
       which would reveal exactly the conditions under which it holds.

4. Then there was the idea (which I didn't actually use) that I might try to prove the result for, say,
       n = 3 to help me understand what was going on. This would not have counted as a proof of the
       result (or anything like it), but it might have given me ideas for tackling the question.

5. A key observation was that the equations given in the question are `circular'. It was clear that the
       circularity was essential to the question and it turned out to be the key to the most difficult part.
       Having identified it early on, I was ready to use it when the opportunity arose.

6. Finally, I was pleased that I read the whole question carefully before plunging in. This allowed me
       to see that I could easily do the last part before the preceding parts, which I found very helpful in
       getting into the question.

Final thoughts

It occurs to me only now, after my post-mortem, that there is another way of obtaining the final result.
Suppose I start with the idea of circularity (as indeed I might have, had I not been otherwise directed by
the question) and use the given equations to find x1 in terms of first x2, then x3, then x4 and eventually
in terms of x1 itself. That should give me an equation I can solve, and I should be able to find out what
conditions are needed on the xi. Try it. You may need to guess a formula for x1 in terms of xi from a
few special cases, then prove it by induction.13 You will find it useful to define a sequence of numbers
Fi such that F0 = F1 = 1 and Fn+1 = Fn + Fn-1. (These numbers are called Fibonacci numbers.14)

                                                                                                                                       

You should find that if xn = x1 for any n (greater than 1), then xn = 2 1 5 .

13 I went as far as x7 to be sure of the pattern: I found that x7 = 85xx11++35 .
14 Fibonacci (short for filius Bonacci -- son of Bonacci) was called the greatest European mathematician of the Middle Ages. He

   was born in Pisa (Italy) in about 1175 AD. He introduced the series of numbers named after him in his book of 1202 called Liber
  Abbaci (Book of the Abacus). It was the solution to the problem of the number of pairs of rabbits produced by an initial pair: A
  pair of rabbits are put in a field and, if rabbits take a month to become mature and then produce a new pair every month after
  that, how many pairs will there be in twelve months time?

Comments

Age has not diminished the value of this old chestnut. It requires almost no mathematics in the sense
of examination syllabuses, but instead tests a vital asset for a mathematician, namely the capacity for
systematic thought. For this reason, it tends to crop up in mathematics contests, where competitors come
from different backgrounds. I most recently saw it in the form `Find all the positive integer solutions of
bc + ca + ab = abc'. (You see the connection?)

You will want to make use of the symmetry between a, b and c: if, for example, a = 2, b = 3 and c = 4,
then the same solution can be expressed in five other ways, such as a = 3, b = 4 and c = 2. You do not
want to derive all these separately, so you need to order a, b and c in some way.

The reason the question uses the word `determine', rather than `find' for part (ii) is that in part (i) you
can write down all the possibilities explicitly, whereas for part (ii) there are, in some cases, an infinite
number of possibilities which obviously cannot be explicitly listed, though they can be described and
hence determined.

Solution to problem 1

Let us take, without any loss of generality, a  b  c.
(i) How small can a be?
First set a = 1. This gives no solutions, because it leaves nothing for 1/b + 1/c.
Next set a = 2 and try values of b (with b  2, since we have assumed that a  b  c) in order:

      if b = 2, then 1/c = 0, which is no good;
      if b = 3, then c = 6, which works;
      if b = 4, then c = 4, which works;
      if b  5, then c  b, so we need not consider this.
Then set a = 3, and try values of b (with b  3) in order:
      if b = 3, then c = 3, which works;
      if b  4, then c  b, so we need not consider this.
Finally, if a  4, then at least one of b and c must be  a, so we need look no further.
The only possibilities are therefore (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 4) and (3, 3, 3).
(ii) Clearly, we must include all the solutions found in part (i). We proceed systematically, as in part (i).
First set a = 1. This time, any values of b and c will do (though we decided to choose b  c).
Next set a = 2 and try values of b (with b  2, since we have assumed that a  b  c) in order:
      if b = 2, then any value of c will do (with b  c).
      if b = 3, then 3, 4, 5 and 6 will do for c, but 7 is too big;
      if b = 4, then c = 4 will do, but 5 is too big for c;
      if b  5, then c  b, so we need not consider this.
Then set a = 3 and try values of b (with b  3) in order:
      if b = 3, then c = 3, which works, but c = 4 is too big;
      if b  4, then c  b, so we need not consider this.
As before a = 4 and b  4, c  4 gives no possibilities.
Therefore the extra sets for part (ii) are of the form (1, b, c), (2, 2, c), (2, 3, 3), (2, 3, 4) and (2, 3, 5).

Post-mortem

A slightly different approach for part (i), which would also generalise for part (ii), is to start with the
case a = b = c, for which the only solution is a = b = c = 13 . If a, b and c are not all equal then one of
them, which we may take to be a, must be greater than 13 , i.e. 12 . The two remaining possibilities follow
easily.
As long as you are methodical, it doesn't matter how you approach the question.
Having done the question, you might well want to investigate whether it generalises: could we replace
the 1 on the right hand side with 2? Could we have four reciprocals instead of three? After a few scrib-
bles, I decided that these other cases are not very interesting; but you might find something I missed.

Comments

I don't really approve of this sort of question, at least as far as STEP is concerned, but I thought I'd
better include one in this collection. The one given above seems to me to be a particularly bad example,
because there are a number of neat and elegant mathematical ways of approaching it, none of which
turn out to be any use.

The quickest instrument is the bluntest: just write out all the possibilities. Two things are important.
First you must be systematic or you will get hopelessly confused; second, you must lay out your solu-
tion, with careful explanations, in a way which allows other people (examiners, for example) to under-
stand exactly what you are doing. You can probably lay it out using pen and paper much better than I
have overleaf, using a word-processing package. If you get an answer and, looking back, find that your
work lacks clarity, then do it again.

Since different parts of STEP questions are nearly always related, you might be led to believe that the
result of the second part follows from the first: you divide the required twenty pence into two tens and
then use the result of the first part to give the number of ways of making up each 10. This would give
an answer of 66 (why?) plus one for a single 20p piece. This would be neat, but the true answer is less
than 67 because some arrangements are counted twice by this method -- and it is not easy to work out
which ones.
22 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 2

Probably the best approach is to start counting with the arrangements which use as many high denom-
ination coins as possible, then work down.
(i) We can make up 10p as follows:
10 (one way using only one 10p coin);
5+5 (one way using two 5p coins and no 10p coins);
5+2+2+1, 5+2+1+1+1, 5+1+1+1+1+1 (three ways using one 5p coin and no 10p coins);
2+2+2+2+2, 2+2+2+2+1+1, etc (six ways using no 5p or 10p coins).
That makes 11 ways altogether.

(ii) We can make up 20p as follows:
20 (one way using only a 20p coin);
10 + any of the 11 arrangements in the first part of the question (11 ways using one or two 10p coins);
5+5+5+5 (one way using four 5p coins and no 10p or 20p coins);
5+5+5+2+2+1, etc (3 ways using three 5p coins and no 10p or 20p coins);
5+5+2+2+2+2+2, 5+5+2+2+2+2+1+1, etc (6 ways using two 5p coins and no 10p or 20p coins);
5+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+1, etc (8 ways using one 5p coin and no 10p or 20p coins);
2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2, etc (11 ways using no 5p, 10p or 20p coins).
That makes 41 ways altogether.

Post-mortem

As in the previous question, the most important lesson to be learnt here is the value of a systematic
approach and clear explanations. You should not be happy just to obtain the answer: there is no virtue
in that. You should only be satisfied if you displayed your working at least as systematically as I have,
above.

On reflection, this question is not quite as bad as I thought. I did in fact use the first part to help
with the second. And in the second part I certainly used the method of setting out the different ways
systematically that I developed in the less complicated first part.

Here is an interesting thought. For the part (i), consider the expansion of

                                     1         ()

             (1 - x10)(1 - x5)(1 - x2)(1 - x)

in powers of x. This we can obtain from the binomial expansion of each of the four terms in the denomi-
nator, giving (1+x10 +x20 +   )(1+x5 +x10 +   )(1+x2 +x4 +   )(1+x+x2 +   ) . Now if we multiply
out these brackets, we find that the term in x10 (say) is the sum of terms of the form x10a  x5b  x2c  xd,
one from each bracket, where a, b, c and d are non-negative integers such that 10a + 5b + 2c + d = 10. It
is not hard to see that there is exactly one possibility for these integers for each of the arrangements of
the coins in part (i), so the number of arrangements is exactly equal to the coefficient of x10 in ().

Although this is neat, it doesn't help, because there is no easy way of obtaining the required coefficient.
Formally, though, we could obtain the coefficient using the Taylor series expansion of (), which in-
volves differentiating () 10 times and setting x = 0. This is interesting, because we have converted
a problem in discrete mathematics, involving only integers, to a problem in calculus involving only
smooth functions.

Problem 3: Mathematical deduction                                                             ()

(i) Write down the average of the integers n1, (n1 + 1), . . . , (n2 - 1), n2 . Show that
                         n1 + (n1 + 1) +    + (n2 - 1) + n2 = 12 (n2 - n1 + 1)(n1 + n2) .

(ii) Write down and prove a general law of which the following are special cases:

                                        1 = 0+1
                             2+3+4 = 1+8
                   5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 8 + 27
                  10 + 11 +    + 16 = 27 + 64 .

Hence prove that

                  13 + 23 + 33 +    + n3 = 14 n2(n + 1)2.

                                                                                              1994 Paper I

Comments

You could use induction to prove your general law, but it is not necessary. The obvious alternative
involves use of part (i). You might think of induction for the second bit of part (ii), but the question
specifically tells you to use the previous result.

There are various ways of summing kth powers of integers, besides the trick given here, which does
not readily generalise to powers other than the third. A simple way is to assume that the result is a
polynomial of degree k + 1. You can then find the coefficients by substituting in k + 1 values of n to
obtain k + 1 simultaneous equations for the coefficients of the polynomial. We can guess that the leading
coefficient will in general be (k + 1)-1, because the sum approximates the area under the graph y = xk
from x = 1 to x = n, which is given by the integral of xk.
24 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 3

(i) The average is 12 (n1 + n2). (This is the mid-point of a ruler with n1 at one end and n2 at the other.)
The sum of any numbers is the average of the numbers times the number of numbers, as given.

(ii) A general rule is

                                        (m+1)2

                                          
                                                k = m3 + (m + 1)3.

                                        k=m2 +1

We can prove this result by applying the formula derived in the first part of the question:

                        (m+1)2
                                        [                  2][                                 ]
                                     1            2                            2         2
                           k = 2 (m + 1) - m (m + 1) + (m + 1)

                        k=m2 +1

                                 = 21 [2m + 1][2m2 + 2m + 2]

                                 = 2m3 + 3m2 + 3m + 1

                                 = m3 + (m + 1)3.

For the last part, we can obtain sums of the cubes by adding together the general law for consecutive

values of m:

              1 + (2 + 3 + 4) + (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) +    + ((N - 1)2 + 1) +    + N 2)
                                  = (0 + 1) + (1 + 8) + (8 + 27) +    + ((N - 1)3 + N 3) .

The left-hand side is just the sum of integers from 1 to N 3, so using the first part gives

                        1  N    2(N  2  +  1)  =  2(13  +  23   +        +  N  3)  -  N  3
                        2

i.e.                    12 N 2(N 2 + 2N + 1) = 2(13 + 23 +    + N 3)
as required.

Post-mortem

To find the general rule requires an understanding of the algebra you have just done: why does it work
in the way it does?
Of course, there are many other `general rules' besides the one given in the solution. The situation is
similar to the `find the next number in the sequence' questions which come up in IQ tests. As no less a
figure than the philosopher Wittgenstein has pointed out, there is no correct answer. Given any finite
sequence of numbers, a formula can always be found which will fit all the given numbers and which
makes the next number (e.g.) 42.
Nevertheless, when the above question was set, almost everyone produced the same general result (or
no result at all). Mathematicians seem to know what sort of thing is required. Electronic computers
might not have the faintest idea what to do, though they would no doubt complete the algebra rapidly.
Note: This question has been changed slightly from the original version in the 1994 paper to include
part (i), and to change the wording slightly in the second part. Having now included a part (i) the hint
given in the original question has now been removed.

(ii) How many integers greater than or equal to zero and less than 9261 are not divisible by 3
       or 7? What is the average value of these integers?

Comments

There are a number of different ways of tackling this problem, but it should be clear that whatever way
you choose for part (i) will also work for part (ii) (especially when you realise the significance of the
number 9261). A key idea for part (i) is to think in terms of blocks of 10 numbers, realising that all
blocks of 10 are the same for the purposes of the problem.
26 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 4

(i) Only integers ending in 1, 3, 7, or 9 are not divisible by 2 or 5. This is 4/10 of the possible integers,
so the total number of such integers is 4/10 of 1,000, i.e. 400.
The integers can be added in pairs:

                                    sum = (1 + 999) + (3 + 997) +    + (499 + 501) .

There are 200 such pairs, so the sum is 1, 000  200 and the average is 500.
A simpler argument to obtain the average would be to say that this is obvious by symmetry: there is
nothing in the problem that favours an answer greater (or smaller) than 500.
Alternatively, we can find the number of integers divisible by both 2 and 5 by adding the number divis-
ible by 2 (i.e. 500) to the number divisible by 5 (i.e. 200), and subtracting the number divisible by both
2 and 5 (i.e. 100) since these have been counted twice. To find the sum, we can sum those divisible by 2
(using the formula for an arithmetic progression), add the sum of those divisible by 5 and subtract the
sum of those divisible by 10. These results can then be used to find the number of integers which are not
divisible by 2 and 5, and the average of these (by first summing all the integers between 1 and 1000).
(ii) Either of the above methods will work. In the first method you consider integers in blocks of 21
(essentially arithmetic to base 21): there are 12 integers in each such block that are not divisible by 3 or 7
(namely 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20) so the total number is 9261  12/21 = 5292 . The average is
9261/2 as can be seen using the pairing argument (1+9260)+(2+9259)+   or the symmetry argument.

Post-mortem

I was in year 7 at school when I had my first encounter with lateral thinking in mathematics. The
problem was to work out how many houses a postman delivers to in a street of houses numbered from
1 to 1000, given that he or she refuses to deliver to houses with the digit 9 in the number. It seemed
impossible to do it systematically, until the idea of counting in base 9 occurred, then it seemed brilliantly
simple. I didn't know I was counting in base 9; in those days, school mathematics was very traditional
and base 9 would have been thought very advanced. All that was required was the idea of working out
how many numbers can be made from nine digits (i.e. 93) instead of from ten digits (i.e. 103); and of
course it doesn't matter which nine.
Did you spot the significance of the number 9261? It is 213 , i.e. the number in base 10 that is written as
1000 in base 21. Note how carefully the question is written and laid out to suggest a connection between
the two paragraphs (and also to highlight the difference). For the examination, the number 1,000,000
was used in part (i) instead of 1000 in order to discourage candidates from spending the first hour of the
examination writing down the numbers from 1 to 1000.
Having realised that part (i) involves (2  5)3 and part (ii) involves (3  7)3 you are probably now
wondering what the general result is, i.e.:
How many integers greater than or equal to zero and less than (pq)3 are not divisible by p or q? What is
the average value of these integers? Let's make p and q co-prime, so that they have no common factors.
I leave this to you, with the hint that you need to think about only pq, rather than (pq)3, to start with.

Comments

This looks more difficult than it is.

There is no clever way to deal with the modulus function: you have to look at the different cases indi-
vidually. For example, for |x| you have to look at x  0 and x  0 . The most straightforward approach
would be to solve the equation in each of the different regions determined by the modulus signs: x  -1,
-1  x  0, 0  x  1, etc. You might find a graphical approach helps you to picture what is going on
(I didn't).
28 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 5

Let
                                   f (x) = |x + 1| - |x| + 3|x - 1| - 2|x - 2| - (x + 2).

We have to solve f (x) = 0 in the five regions of the x-axis determined by the modulus functions, namely

                        - < x  -1 ; -1  x  0 ; 0  x  1 ; 1  x  2 ; 2  x <  .

In the separate regions, we have


 -(x + 1) + x - 3(x - 1) + 2(x - 2) - (x + 2) = -2x - 4 for - < x  -1
                                                          -2 for -1  x  0

f (x) =    (x + 1) - x - 3(x - 1) + 2(x - 2) - (x + 2) = -2x - 2 for  0x1
                                                                      1x2
           (x + 1) - x + 3(x - 1) + 2(x - 2) - (x + 2) = 4x - 8 for   2x<
         
           (x + 1) - x + 3(x - 1) - 2(x - 2) - (x + 2) =  0 for

Solving in each region gives:

1. - < x  -1: here, f (x) = 0 only if x = -2. This is a solution since the point x = -2 lies in the
       region x  -1.

2. -1  x  0: here, f (x) = -2 (= 0) so there is no solution.

3. 0  x  1: here, f (x) = 0 only if x = -1. This is not a solution since the point x = -1 does not lie
       in the region 0  x  1.

4. 1  x  2: here, f (x) = 0 only if x = 2, which is a solution since x = 2 lies in the range 1  x  2 .

5. 2  x < : here, f (x) = 0 identically (i.e. for all values of x), so the equation is satisfied for all x
       in the region.

Collecting these results together shows that the equation f (x) = 0 is satisfied only by x = -2 and by
any x in the region x  2.

Post-mortem

As mentioned before, this should not be found too difficult once you identify the different regions and
consider each on its own. Some care is needed, though, and it would be sensible to go back and check
that the solutions do indeed satisfy the original equation.
Two small points of technique:

 Since it was necessary to refer to the original equation quite a few times, I found it useful to define
       a function f so that the equation became f (x) = 0.
       Alternatively, you could label the equation with a (), say, when you first write it down and then
       later say `Equation () becomes ...'.

 It helped me to set out the different cases very clearly. I numbered them later but it might well
       have saved writing to number them at the beginning.

Comments

The first difficulty with this elegant problem is drawing the diagram. However, you can simplify both
the drawing and the solution by restricting your attention to just one sector of a circle of radius a.
The figure sketched above has constant diameter; it can roll between two parallel lines without losing
contact with either. (This looks plausible and you can verify it by sellotaping some 50 pence coins
together, but a solid proof is not very easy.) The distance between these lines is the diameter of the
figure. Like a circle, the 50 pence piece has circumference equal to  times the diameter, which is in fact
always true for a figure with constant diameter.
Reuleaux polygons are general polygons of constant diameter, and a heptagon has seven sides, like, for
example, British 50 and 20 pence pieces, Botswanan 50 thebe coins and Jordanian half dinars. The shield
on Lancia cars is a Reuleaux triangle.

First we need angle AEB. We know that AOB = 27  and hence BOE = 12 (2 - 27 ) = 67  (using
the sum of angles round the point O). Finally,

AEB = 2OEB = 2  12 ( - 67 ) = 17  ,

using the sum of angles of an isosceles triangle.15
Now ABE is a sector of a circle of radius a, so its area is

                                                         a2 1  7  = a2 .
                                                                  2 14

The area of triangle OBE is 12 BE height, i.e.

                                    1 a  a tan OBE = a2 tan  .
                                    22                 4 14

The area of the coin is therefore    ( a2           a2  )
which reduces to the given answer.   7  14 - 2  4 tan 14 ,

Post-mortem

It is simple now to calculate the area of a regular n-sided Reuleaux polygon. You should of course find
that the area tends to that of a circle of the same diameter as n   .

15 After the first edition was published, a correspondent pointed out that the following argument gives angle AEB more quickly:
   clearly A, B and E all lie on a circle with centre O; the angle at O subtended by the chord AB is 27 , so the angle at the
   circumference is 17 . Obvious, really--can't think why I didn't see it.

Comments

Wording this sort of question is a real headache for the examiners. Suppose you guess wrong; how can
you then prove your guess by induction (unless you get that wrong too)? How else can the question be
phrased? In the end, we decided to assume that you are all so clever that your guesses will all be correct.
To guess the formula, you need to work out x1, x2, x3 , etc and look for a pattern. You should not need
to go beyond x4 .
Proof by induction is not in the A-level Mathematics specifications. We decided to include it in the
specification for STEP 1 because the idea behind it is not difficult and it is very important both as a
method of proof and also as an introduction to more sophisticated mathematical thought.

Solution to problem 7

First, let's put the equations into a more manageable form. Each equality can be written in the form

                                               3 = xn + 2 , i.e. xn+1 = 2 .
                                                           xn+1              3 - xn

We  find  x1  =  23 ,  x2  =  67 ,  x3  =  14  and  x4  =  31 30 .  The  denominators  give  the  game  away.  We  guess
                                           15

                                                                  2n+1 - 2
                                                           xn = 2n+1 - 1 .

For the induction, we need a starting point: our guess certainly holds for n = 1 (and 2, 3, and 4!).
For the inductive step, we suppose our guess also holds for n = k, where k is any integer, so that

                                                                  2k+1 - 2
                                                           xk = 2k+1 - 1 .

If we can show that it then also holds for n = k + 1, we are done.
We have, from the equation given in the question,

                                        2               2                2(2k+1 - 1)              2k+2 - 2
                       xk+1 = 3 - xk = 3 - k+1 2k+1-2 = 3(2k+1 - 1) - (2k+1 - 2) = 2k+2 - 1 ,
                                                    2 -1

as required.

Post-mortem

There's not much to say about this. By STEP standards, it is fairly easy and short. Nevertheless, you are
left to your own devices from the beginning, so you should be pleased if you got it out.

Perhaps the key step came in the very first line of the solution, when we had to decide how to separate
out the equations. We could have tried instead

                                                           x2 + 2 = x3 + 2
                                                                    x3   x4

leading to

                                                        (x2 - x3) = 2(x3 - x4) ,
                                                                            x3x4

and so on, but it would not be at all clear what to do next.

There are three distinct parts. It is pretty certain that they are related, but it is not obvious what the
relationship is. Part (i) must surely help with part (ii) in some way that will only become apparent once
part (ii) is under way.
In the absence of any other good ideas, it looks right to start part (ii) by expressing the double and triple
angle tans in terms of single angle tans. You should remember the formula

                                                tan(A + B) = tan A + tan B .
                                                                   1 - tan A tan B

You can use this for tan 3 and hence (later on) for cot 3 . If you ever forget the tan(A + B) formula, you
can quickly work it out from the corresponding sin and cos formulae:

                                tan(A + B) = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B .
                                                    cos(A + B) cos A cos B - sin A sin B

You are are not expected to remember the more complicated triple angle formulae (I certainly don't).
You may well find yourself trying to solve cubic equations at some stage in this question; no need
to panic -- there is sure to be one easily spottable root, in which case you can reduce the cubic to a
quadratic.
Interesting, isn't it, that the range of  for part (iii) is not the obvious 0 <  < 2? Maybe that is
significant.
34 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 8

We will write t for tan  (or tan ) throughout.
(i) tan 2 = 1 - t2 2t = -1 (since 2t = t2 - 1 by minor rearrangement of the given equation).

(ii) We first work out tan 3 . We have

                                                   tan  + tan 2 t + 1-t2 2t 3t - t3            2,
                        tan 3 = tan( + 2) =                         =        2t =
                                                   1 - tan  tan 2 1 - t 1-t2 1 - 3t

so the equation becomes

                                 3t - t3 = t - 2, i.e. t3 - 3t2 + t + 1 = 0.
                                 1 - 3t2

One solution (by inspection) is t = 1. Thus one set of roots is given by  = n + 14  .

There are no other obvious integer roots, but we can reduce the cubic equation to a quadratic equation by
dividing out the known factor (t-1). I would start by writing t3 -3t2 +t+1  (t-1)(t2 +at-1) since the
coefficients of t2 and of t0 in the quadratic bracket are obvious. Then I would multiply out the brackets
to find that a = -2 . Now we see the connection with part (i): t2 +at-1 = t2 -2t-1 = 0  tan 2 = -1 ,
and hence 2 = n - 14  .

The roots are therefore  = n + 14  and  = 12 n - 18 . The multiples of  in the given range are
{ 14 , 38 , 78 , 54 , 118 , 158 }.

(iii) For the last part, we could set cot  = 1 and cot 3 = 1                        in the given equation, thereby
                                                   tan                       tan 3

obtaining

                                                   1       1 - 3t2
                                                   t = 2 + 3t - t3 .

This simplifies to the cubic equation t3 + t2 - 3t + 1 = 0 . There is an integer root t = 1, and the remaining
quadratic is t2 + 2t - 1 = 0 . Learning from the first part, we write this as 1 - t2 2t = 1, which means that
tan 2 = n + 14  . Proceeding as before gives (noting the different range) the following multiples of  :
{ 14 , 18 , - 38 , - 34 , - 78 , - 118 }.

Post-mortem

There was a small but worthwhile notational point in this question: it is often possible to use the abbre-
viation t for tan (or s for sin, etc), which can save a great deal of writing.

There are two other points worth recalling. First is the way that part (i) fed into part (ii), but had to be
mildly adapted for part (iii). This is a typical device used in STEP questions, aimed to see how well you
learn new ideas. Second is what to do when faced with a cubic equation. There is a formula for the
roots of a cubic, but no one knows it nowadays. Instead, you have to find at least one root by inspection.
Having found one root, you have a quick look to see if there are any other obvious roots and, if not, then
divide out the known factor to obtain a quadratic equation.

The  detectives    amongst  you  will  have  worked   out  the  reason  for  the  peculiar  choice  -   3     <      <  12   for
                                                                                                        2

part (iii). The reciprocal relation between tan and cot we used at the start of part (iii) is not the only way

to  relate  these  two  trigonometric  functions.  We  could  have  instead  used   cot  A  =  tan(  1     -  A)  .
                                                                                                     2

The equation of part (ii) transforms exactly into the equation of part (iii) if we set  = 12  - . Further-

more, the given range of  corresponds exactly to the range of  given in part (ii). We can therefore write

down the solutions for part (iii) directly from the solutions for part (ii).

Note that `by change of variable' means the same as `by substitution'.

There are two things to worry about when you are trying to find a change of variable to convert one
integral to another: you need to make the integrands match up and you need to make the limits match
up. Sometimes, the limits give the clue to the change of variable. (For example, if the limits on the
original integral were 0 and 1 and the limits on the transformed integral were 0 and 14 , then an obvious
possibility would be to make the substitution t = tan x ). Here, the change of variable is determined by
the integrand, since it must work for all choices of f.

Perhaps you are worried about the infinite upper limit of the integrals. If you are trying to prove some

rigorous result about infinite integrals, you might use the definition

                                      a

                                   f (x) dx = lim f (x) dx ,
                                   a 0
                                0

but for present purposes you just do the integral and put in the limits. The infinite limit will not normally

present problems. For example,

 (x-2 + e-x)dx = (-x-1 - e-x)  = - 1 - e- + 1 + e-1 = 1 + e-1 .
                                                                        1
1                                  1

Don't be afraid of writing 1/ = 0 . It is perfectly OK to use this as shorthand for lim 1/x = 0 ; but

                                                                                                                                                                 x

/,  -  and 0/0 are definitely not OK, because of their ambiguity.
36 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 9

Clearly, to get the argument of f right, we must set

                                                t  =    (x2  +        1  +  x  .

                                                                1) 2

We must check that the new limits are correct (if not, we are completely stuck). When x = 0, t = 1 as

required.  Also, (x2              1     as x    , so t        as x             .  Thus the upper limit is still  , again as

                      + 1) 2

required.

Using the standard method of changing the variable in an integral (basically the chain rule), the integral

becomes                                              dx

                                                             f (t) dt
                                                                dt
                                                      1

so the next task is to find dx . This we can do in two ways: we find x in terms of t and differentiate it; or
                                  dt

we could find dt and turn it upside down. The snag with the second method is that the answer will be
                   dx

in terms of x, so we will have to express x in terms of t anyway--in which case, we may as well use the

first method.

We start by finding x in terms of t:

                         t = (x2 + 1) 21 + x  (t - x)2 = (x2 + 1)  x = t2 - 1 = t - 1 .
                                                                                           2t 2 2t

Note that for each value of t there is exactly one value of x; we need this for the substitution to work.

Then we differentiate:                        dx dt = 12 + 2t2 1 = 12 (1 + t-2)

which is exactly the factor that we require for the transformed integrand given in the question.

For the last part, we take f (t) = t-3. Thus

                        ((x2 + 1) 1 ) 2 + x -3 dx = 1  (t-3 + t-5) dt
                                                                21
                      0                                         ( -2 -4 ) 

                                                         = 1 t +t
                                                                2 -2 -4 1

                                                         = 1 1 + 1 = 3 , as required.

This is not a difficult question conceptually once you realise the significance of the fact that the change
of variable must work whatever function f is in the integrand.
There was a useful point connected with calculating dx . It was a good idea not to plunge into the

Finally, there was the infinite limit of the integrand, which I hope you saw was not something to worry
about (even though infinite limits are excluded from the A-level Mathematics specifications). If you
were setting up a formal definition of what an integral is, you would have to use finite limits, but if you
are merely calculating the value of an integral, you just go ahead and do it, with whatever limits you are
given.

Comments

The four parts are (somewhat annoyingly) related only by the fact that you have to decide whether each
statement is true or false.

If true, the justification has to be a proof. If false, you could prove that it is false in some general way,
but it is nearly always better to find a simple counterexample -- as simple as possible.
Part (iii) might look a bit odd. I suppose it relates to the standard approximation cos x  1 - 12 x2 which
holds when x is small. This result can be improved by using a polynomial of higher degree: the next
term is + 14! x4 . It can be proved that cos x can be approximated as accurately as you like for small x by
a polynomial of the form

                                                           N (-1)n x2n
                                                          n=0 (2n)!

(the truncated Maclaurin expansion). You have to use more terms of the approximation (i.e. a larger
value of N ) if you want either greater accuracy or larger x. In part (iii) of this question, you are being
asked if there is a polynomial such that the approximation is good for all values of x .

I've awarded the question  for difficulty, just because quite a few good ideas are required.

Solution to problem 10

(i) True. The easiest way to see this is to log both sides. For the left hand side, we have
                                                       ln(aln b) = (ln b)(ln a)

and for the right hand side we have

                                               ln(bln a) = (ln a)(ln b) ,

which agree.

Note that we have to be a bit careful with this sort of argument. The argument used is that A = B
because ln A = ln B . This requires the property of the ln function that ln A = ln B  A = B . You can
easily see that this property holds because ln is a strictly increasing function; if A > B, then ln A > ln B .
The same would not hold for (say) sin (i.e. sin A = sin B  A = B ).

(ii) False.  = 12  is an easy counterexample. Even though it is `obvious' we still need to show that
cos 1 = 0, which we could do by noting that 0 < 1 < 13  and sketching the graph of cos x.

(iii) False. Roughly speaking, any polynomial can be made as large as you like by taking x to be very
large (provided it is of degree greater than zero), whereas | cos x|  1 ; and there is obviously no polyno-
mial of degree zero (i.e. no constant number) for which the statement holds.

But how can we write this out formally? First let us knock off the case when the polynomial is of degree

zero,  i.e.  a  constant,  call  it  P.  Then  either  P    1  or  P  <  12 .  In  either  case,  P  cannot  be  close  to  both  cos 0
                                                            2

and  cos  1  .
          2

Now suppose

                                                                      N-1
                                               P(x) = aN xN + anxn
                                                                                                                                  ()

                                                                         n=0

where N  1 and assume aN > 0. It is enough to show that P(x) > 2 for some value of x. We can find
a number x so large that aN xN > N |an|xn + 2 for each integer n with 0  n  N - 1. The smallest

possible value of P(x) for any given positive x would be achieved if all the coefficients in the sum were

negative. Thus

                                                      N-1
                                 P(x)  aN xN - |an|xn > aN xN + (2 - aN xN ) = 2

                                                                n=0

and we are done.

(iv) True: x4 + 3 + x-4 = (x2 - x-2)2 + 5  5 .

Post-mortem

The important point here is that if you want to show a statement is true, you have to give a formal proof,
whereas if you want to show that it is false, you only need give one counterexample. It does not have to
be an elaborate counterexample -- in fact, the simpler the better.

My proof for part (iii) is more elaborate than could have been expected of candidates in the examination.
A sketch of a polynomial of degree N would have been enough, provided the special case of N = 0 was
dealt with separately.

Comments

Fractions written as the sum of unit fractions are called Egyptian fractions: they were used by Egyptians.

The earliest record of such use is 1900BC. The Rhind papyrus in the British Museum gives a table of
representations of fractions of the form 2 as sums of unit fractions for all odd integers n between 5 and

                                                     n
101 -- a remarkable achievement when you consider that algebra was 3,500 years in the future.

It is not clear why Egyptians represented fractions this way; maybe it just seemed a good idea at the

time. Certainly the notation they used, in which for example 1 was denoted by n with an oval on top,
                                                                                  n

does not lend itself to generalisation to fractions that are not unit. One of the rules for expressing non-

unit fractions in terms of unit fractions was that all the unit fractions in should be distinct, so 2 had to
                                                                                           7
be expressed as 1 + 1 instead of as 1 + 1 , which seems pretty daft.
          4 28             77

It is not obvious that every fraction can be express in Egyptian form; this was proved by Fibonacci in

1202. There are however still many unsolved problems relating to Egyptian fractions.

Egyptian fractions have been called a wrong turn in the history of mathematics; if so, it was a wrong
turn that favoured style over utility; no bad thing, in my opinion.

Solution to problem 11

A good guess would be that the first term of the decomposition of 1 is 1 , i.e. a = N + 1. In that
                                                                                          N N +1

case, the other term is 1 - 1 i.e. b = N (N + 1) . That proves the result that every unit fraction can
                              N N +1

be expressed as the sum of two unit fractions.

The only factors of N 2 (since N is prime) are 1 , N and N 2 . The possible factorisations of N 2 are
therefore N 2 = 1  N 2 or N 2 = N  N . We discount N  N , since this would lead to a = b, and this is
ruled out in the question. That leaves only a - N = 1 and b - N = N 2 (or the other way round). Thus
N + 1 and N 2 + N are the only possible values for a and b and the decomposition is unique.

For the second half, set                                 2 =1+1
                                                         N ab

where a = b . We need to aim for an equation with N 2 on one side, so that we can use the method of the

first part. We have ab - 12 (a + b)N = 0 which we write as
                            ( N ) ( N ) N 2 2
                               a - 2 b - 2 = 4 i.e. (2a - N ) (2b - N ) = N .

Thus 2a - N = N 2 and 2b - N = 1 (or the other way round). The decomposition is therefore unique

and given by

                                         2       =1 2    1        +1  1          .

                                      N 2 (N + N ) 2 (N + 1)

The  only  possible  fly  in  the  ointment  is  the  1  in  the  denominators:     a  and  b  are  supposed  to  be  integers.
                                                      2

However, all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, so N + 1 and N 2 + N are both even and the

denominators are indeed integers.

Post-mortem

Another way of getting the last part (less systematically) would have been to notice that

                          1        1             1                2      1                     1
                              =       +                      = = 1                  +1
                     N (N + 1) N (N + 1) N 2 (N + 1) 2 N (N + 1)

which gives the result immediately. How might you have noticed this? Well, I noticed it by trying to
work out some examples, starting with what is given at the very beginning of the question. If 1 = 1 + 1

                                                                                                                           3 4 12
then 2 = 2 + 2 which works.

       3 4 12
Of course, the advantage of the systematic approach is that it allows for generalisation: what happens if

N is odd but not prime; what happens if the numerator is 3 not 2?

Problem 12: Maximising with constraints  ()

Prove that the rectangle of greatest perimeter which can be inscribed in a given circle is a square.
The result changes if, instead of maximising the sum of lengths of sides of the rectangle, we seek
to maximise the sum of nth powers of the lengths of those sides for n  2. What happens if
n = 2? What happens if n = 3? Justify your answers.

Comments

Obviously, the perimeter of a general rectangle has no maximum (it can be as long as you like), so the
key to this question is to use the constraint that the rectangle lies in the circle.

The vertices of a rectangle of greatest perimeter must lie on the circle; this seems obvious, but you should
devote the first sentence of your solution to justifying it. And draw a diagram (I didn't because there
wasn't enough room on the page).

The word `greatest' in the question immediately suggests differentiating something. The perimeter of
a rectangle is expressed in terms of two variables, length x and breadth y, so you must find a way of
using the constraint to eliminate one variable. This could be done in two ways: express y in terms of x,
or express both x and y in terms of another variable (an angle, say).

Finally, there is the matter of deciding whether your solution is the greatest or least value (or neither).
This can be done either by considering second derivatives, or by trying to understand the different
situations. Often the latter method, or a combination, is preferable.

The theory of stationary values of functions subject to constraints is very important: it has widespread
applications (for example, in theoretical physics, financial mathematics and in fact in almost any area
to which mathematics is applied). It forms a whole branch of mathematics called optimisation. Nor-
mally, the methods described above (eliminating one variable) are not used: a clever idea, the method
of Lagrange multipliers, is used instead.
42 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 12

The vertices of the rectangle must lie on the circle. Suppose not. Then two adjacent vertices (at least) lie
in the interior of the circle. We could then increase the perimeter by extending two sides beyond these
vertices. [You should include a diagram here!]

Let the circle have diameter d and let the length of one side of the rectangle be x and the length of the
adjacent side be y.

Then, by Pythagoras's theorem,             

                                         y = d2 - x2                                                ()

and the perimeter P is given by                    
                                     P = 2x + 2 d2 - x2 .

We can find the largest possible value of P as x varies by calculus. We have

                                     dP = 2 - 2  x ,
                                     dx      d2 - x2

so for a stationary point we require (cancelling the factor of 2 and squaring)

                                             x2 2 2
                                    1 = 2 2 i.e. 2x = d .
                                     d -x
                                                                                                  
Thus x = d/ 2 (ignoring x = -d/ 2 for obvious reasons). Substituting this into () gives y = d/ 2, so
                                           
the rectangle is indeed a square, with perimeter 2 2d .

But is this the maximum perimeter? The easiest way to investigate is to calculate the second derivative,
                                                                                                                

which is easily seen to be negative for all values of x, and in particular when x = d/ 2 . The stationary

point is certainly a maximum. Alternatively, we could argue that the rectangle for which x = 0 has
                                         
perimeter 2d which is less than 2 2d so x = d/ 2 cannot correspond to the minimum perimeter.

For the second part, we consider                                                               n

                                     f (x) = xn + (d2 - x2) 2 .

The first thing to notice is that f is constant if n = 2, so in this case, the largest (and smallest) value is d2 .
You can use Pythagoras's theorem to see why this result holds.

For n = 3 , we have                  f (x) = 3x2 - 3x(d2 - x2 1 ) 2 ,

so f (x) is stationary when x4 = x2(d2 - x2), i.e. when 2x2 = d2 as before or when x = 0. The corre-
                                               3 3

sponding stationary values of f are 2d and 2d , so this time the largest value occurs when x = 0.

Post-mortem

You will almost certainly want to investigate the situation for other values of n yourself, just to see what
happens.
Were you happy with the proof given above that the square has the largest perimeter? And isn't it a bit
odd that we did not discover a stationary point corresponding to the smallest value (which can easily be
seen to occur at x = 0 or x = d)? To convince yourself that the maximum point gives the largest value,

                                                                                                                   
it is a good idea to sketch a graph: you can check that dP/dx is positive for 0 < x < d/ 2 and negative

       
for d/ 2 < x < d. The smallest values of the perimeter occur at the endpoints of the interval 0  x  d
and therefore do not have to be turning points.
A much better way of tackling the problem is to set x = d cos  and y = d sin  and find the perimeter
as a function of . Because  can take any value (there are no end points such as x = 0 to consider), the
largest and smallest perimeters correspond to stationary points. Try it.

number of terms required in the expansions. You first have to decide how many you will need to obtain

the given number of decimal places; then you have to think about whether the next term is likely to

affect the value of the last decimal.  (  )1 
          
It is not at all obvious where the 2 in part (i) comes from until you write 1 - 150 2 = 50 49 .

For part (ii), you have to choose N in such a way that 125 + N has something to do with a power of 2.

You can make the arithmetic of the binomial expansions a bit easier by arranging the denominator to
                                                                                                  ( 2 )21

be a power of 10 so that, for example, the expansion in part (i) becomes 1 - 100 . No need to use a
calculator.

Solution to problem 13

(i) First we expand binomially:

(                  )1
              22
   1 - 100
              ( 1 )( 2 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 )( 1 ) ( 2 )2 ( 1 ) ( 1 )( 1 ) ( 3 )( 2 )3
= 1 + 2 - 100 + 2! 2 - 2 - 100 - 3! 2 - 2 - 2 - 100 +   

            155
 1 - - 5 - 7 = 0.9899495 .

          100 10 10

It is clear that the next term in the expansion would introduce the eighth decimal place, which it seems

we do not need. Of course, after further manipulations we might find that the above calculation does
                                                            

not supply the 6 decimal places we need for 2, in which case we will have to work out the next term

in the expansion.

( )1                    
98 2 7 2
But 100 = 10 , so 2  9.899495/7  1.414214 .

(ii) We have

(                   )1
                   33
         1 + 125
              ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 )2 ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 5 ) ( 3 )3
= 1 + 3 125 + 2! 3 - 3 125 + 3! 3 - 3 - 3 125 +   

              8         64 5 83
 1 + 1000 - 106 + 3 109

= 1.007936 +            256 1  8 = 1.007937 .

                        3 10

Successive terms in the expansion decrease by a factor of about 1000, so this should give the right num-

ber of decimal places.

( )1          43 2      83 2     3 10.0793
  128 3
But 125 = 5 = 10 so 2  8  1.259921 .

Post-mortem

This question required a bit of intuition, and some accurate arithmetic. You don't have to be brilliant
at arithmetic to be a good mathematician, but most mathematicians aren't bad at it. There have in the
past been children who were able to perform extraordinary feats of arithmetic. For example, Zerah
Colburn, a 19th-century American, toured Europe at the age of 8. He was able to multiply instantly any
two 4-digit numbers given to him by the audiences. George Parker Bidder (the Calculating Boy) could
perform similar feats, though unlike Colburn he became a distinguished mathematician and scientist.
One of his brothers knew the bible by heart.

The error in the approximation is the weak point of this question. Although it is clear that the next term
in the expansion is too small to affect the accuracy, it is not obvious that the sum of all the next hundred
(say) terms of the expansion is negligible (though in fact it is). What is needed is an estimate of the
truncation error in the binomial expansion. Such an estimate is not hard to obtain (first-year university
work) and is typically of the same order of magnitude as the first neglected term in the expansion.
Without this estimate, the approximation is not justified.

Comments

Often with modulus signs, it is easiest to consider the cases separately, so for example in part (i), you
would first work out the case x > 0 and y > 0, then x > 0 and y < 0, and so on. Here there is a simple
geometric understanding of the different cases: once you have worked out the first case, the other three
can be deduced by symmetry.
Another geometric idea should be in your mind when tackling this question, namely the idea of trans-
lations in the plane.

Post-mortem

There was no room for a post-mortem over the page, because the diagrams take up so much space.
Don't read this until you have tried the question!
There are two key learning points, if you will excuse this horrible expression.
The first is that if you want to sketch a region, it is often best to draw the curves that define the boundary
of the region, then just work out whether you want the interior or exterior of the boundary by choosing
one interior point and seeing whether it satisfies the inequalities.
The second is that quite complicated inequalities can sometimes be much simplified by translating or
rotating the axes.

Solution to problem 14

The way to deal with the modulus signs in this question is to consider first the case when the things

inside the modulus signs are positive, and then get the full picture by symmetry, shifting the origin as

appropriate.

For part (i), consider the first quadrant x  0 and y  0. In this                       y
quadrant, the inequality is x + y  1 . Draw the line x + y = 1 and
then decide which side of the line is described by the inequality.                   d
                                                                                        d
It is obviously (since x has to be smaller than something) the re-                         d
                                                                                              dx
gion to the left of the line; or (since y also has to be smaller than                          d

something) the region below the line, which is the same region.

                                                                                        y

Similar arguments could be used in the other quadrants, but it is                    d
easier to note that the inequality |x| + |y|  1 is unchanged when
x is replaced by -x , or y is replaced by -y , so the sketch should                          d
have reflection symmetry in both axes, as shown in the diagram
on the right.                                                               d                d

Part (ii) is the same as part (i), except for a translation. The origin     d                d
of (i) is now at (1, 1).                                                     d                  d

For part (iii), consider first x - y  1, instead of |x - 1| - |y + 1|  1. For x > 0 and y > 0 , this gives

a region that is infinite in extent in the positive y direction, as shown in the first diagram below. Then

reflect this in both axes and translate one unit down the y axis and 1 unit along the positive x axis as

shown in the second and third diagrams below.                                     y

              y                                y                            d                              x

For part (iv), consider first the rectangular hyperbola xy = 1 reflected in both axes to give four hyperbo-

las, as in the first diagram below. Then translate the four hyperbolas translated 2 units up the y axis as

in the final diagram. The region required is enclosed by the four hyperbolas.

Comments

This question gets a  difficulty rating because inequalities always need to be handled with care.
For the very first part, you could either factorise the left hand side to obtain the right hand side, or
multiply out the right hand side to get the left hand side. Obviously, it is much easier to do the multi-
plication than the factorisation. But is that `cheating' or taking a short cut that might lose marks? No, it
is not cheating: it doesn't matter if you start from the given answer and work backwards -- it is still a
mathematical proof and any proof will get the marks. (But note that if there is a `hence' in the question,
you will lose marks if you do not use the result or results that you have just proved.)
In part (ii), you have to do the factorisation yourself, so you should look carefully at where the terms in
the (very similar) first part came from. It will help to spot the similarities between x2 - y2 + x + 3y - 2
and x2 - 4y2 + 3x - 2y + 2 .
Since no indication is given as to what detail should appear on the sketch, you have to use your judge-
ment: it is clearly important to know where the regions lie relative to the coordinate axes.

Post-mortem

As in the previous sketching question, the solution is so long that there is no room for a post-mortem
after the answer.
Don't read this before having tried the question!
The answer given overleaf is inadequate in two ways, each of which would have probably lost me
marks. First, as in the previous question, the answer should definitely have referred to the boundaries.
Here, the inequalities are strict, which means that the boundary lines are excluded from the required
regions. Second, justification should have been provided for the claim that the point (1, 2) satisfies
both inequalities. This could be provided either by simply indicating the position of the point on both
sketches or algebraically by substitution into the inequalities.
48 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 15

To do the multiplication, it pays to be systematic and to set out the algebra nicely:

                  (x - y + 2)(x + y - 1) = x(x + y - 1) - y(x + y - 1) + 2(x + y - 1)
                                                  = x2 + xy - x - yx - y2 + y + 2x + 2y - 2
                                                  = x2 + x - y2 + 3y - 2

as required. y                                 For the first inequality, we need both x - y + 2 and x + y - 1 either

d                    y = x+2                   to be positive or to be negative. To sort out the inequalities (or

d

   d                                           inequations as they are sometimes horribly called), the first thing

(- 21 , 23 ) d d                               to do is to draw the lines defined by the corresponding equalities.

      d                                        These lines divide the plane into four regions and we then have

                  d               x            to decide which regions are relevant.

                  d                            The    diagonal       lines     x  -  y  =  -2  and   x  +  y  =    1  intersect  at   (-  1  ,  3  )  ;
                                                                                                                                          2     2
                     d

                     d                         this is the important point to mark on the sketch. The required

                        d                      regions are the left and right quadrants formed by these diagonal

                              dd               lines (since the inequalities mean that the regions are to the right
                     y = 1-x

                                               of both lines or to the left of both lines).

For part (ii), the first thing to do is to factorise x2 - 4y2 + 3x - 2y + 2 . The key similarity with the first

part is the absence of `cross' terms of the form xy . This allows a difference-of-two-squares factorisation

of the first two terms: x2 - 4y2 = (x - 2y)(x + 2y) . Following the pattern of the first part, we can then

try a factorisation of the form

                        x2 - 4y2 + 3x - 2y + 2 = (x - 2y + a)(x + 2y + b)

where ab = 2 . Considering the terms linear in x and y gives a + b = 3 and 2a - 2b = -2 which quickly
leads to a = 1 and b = 2 . Note that altogether there were three equations for a and b, so we had no right
to expect a consistent solution (except for the fact that this is a STEP question for which we had every
right to believe that the first part would guide us through the second part).

Alternatively, we could have completed the square in x and in y and then used difference of two squares:

          x2 - 4y2 + 3x - 2y + 2 =             (x + 32 )2 - 94 - (2y + 12 )2 + 14 + 2
                                            =
                                               (x  +  23 )2  -  (2y  +  21 )2  =  (x    +  3  -  2y  -  12 )(x  +  3  +  2y  +  12 )  .
                    y                                                                      2                       2

                            2y = x + 1         As in the previous case, the required region is formed by two

                                                     2yz + zx - 5xy = 2
                                                      yz - zx + 2xy = 1              1996 Paper II
                                                     yz - 2zx + 6xy = 3 .

Show that

                                             xyz = 6

and find the possible values of x, y and z.

Comments

At first sight, this looks forbidding. A closer look reveals that the variables x, y and z occur only in
pairs yz, zx and xy. The problem therefore boils down to solving three simultaneous equations in the
variables yz, zx and xy, then using the solution to find x, y and z individually.

What do you make of the equation xyz = 6 ? How could the  arise?

There are two ways of tackling such simultaneous equations. You could use the first equation to find
an expression for one variable (yz say) in terms of the other two variables, then substitute this into the
other equations to eliminate yz from the system. Then use the second equation (in its new form) to find
an expression for one of the two remaining variables (zx say), and substitute this into the third equation
(in its new form) to obtain an equation for the third variable (xy). Having solved this equation, you can
substitute back to find the other variables. This method is called Gauss elimination.

Alternatively, you could eliminate one variable (yz say) from the first two of equations by multiplying
the first equation by something suitable and the second equation by something suitable and subtract-
ing. You then eliminate yz from the second and third equations similarly. That leaves you with two
simultaneous equations in two variables which you can solve by your favourite method.

There is another way of solving the simultaneous equations, which is better in theory than in practice.

You write the equations in matrix form Mx = c, where in this case

             2 1 -5                                                     
                                                       yz                   2
                     
           M =  1 -1 2  ,                                               
                                             x =  zx  ,            c =  1 .

             1 -2 6                                    xy                  3

The solution is then x = M-1c . All you have to do is invert a 3  3 matrix, which is doable but not very
pleasant. You might like to try it if you know the formula for the inverse of a matrix.

Solution to problem 16

Start by labelling the equations:

                                     2yz + zx - 5xy = 2 ,        (1)

                                     yz - zx + 2xy = 1 ,         (2)

                                     yz - 2zx + 6xy = 3 .        (3)

We use Gaussian elimination. Rearranging equation (1) gives

                                     yz = - 12 zx + 52 xy + 1 ,  (4)

which we substitute back into equations (2) and (3) :

                                     - 32 zx + 92 xy = 0 ,       (5)

                                     - 52 zx + 172 xy = 2 .      (6)

Thus zx = 3xy (using equation (5)). Substituting into equation (6) gives xy = 2 and zx = 6 . Finally,
substituting back into equation (1) shows that yz = 3 .
The question is now plain sailing. Multiplying the three values together gives (xyz)2 = 36 and taking
the square root gives xyz = 6 as required.

Now it remains to solve for x, y and z individually. We know that yz = 3, so if xyz = +6 then x = +2,
and if xyz = -6 then x = -2. The solutions are therefore either x = +2, y = 1, and z = 3 or x = -2,
y = -1, and z = -3.

Post-mortem

There were two key observations which allowed us to do this question quite easily. Both came from
looking carefully at the question. The first was that the given equations, although non-linear in x, y and
z (they are quadratic, since they involve products of these variables) could be thought of as three linear
equations in yz, zx and xy. That allowed us to make a start on the question. The second observation
was that the equation xyz = 6 is almost certain to come from (xyz)2 = 36 and that gave us the next
step after solving the simultaneous equations. (Recall the next step was to multiply all the variables
together.)

There was a point of technique in the solution: it is often very helpful in this sort of problem (and many
others) to number your equations. This allows you to refer back clearly and quickly, for your benefit as
well as for the benefit of your readers.

The three simultaneous quadratic equations (1) - (3) have a geometric interpretation but it is not at all
obvious. The equations are quadratic in the variables x, y and z, which means that each equation repre-
sents either an ellipsoid or a hyperboloid (or some special cases).16 The solutions of all three equations
represent the points of intersection of the three surfaces. Not very easy to picture.

16 An ellipsoid is roughly the shape of the surface of a rugby ball, or of the giant galaxy ESO 325-G004. A hyperboloid can either be
   the shape of an infinite radar dish (in fact, a pair of such dishes) or it can be the shape of a power station cooling tower. Our
   equations in fact represent hyperboloids of the cooling-tower type.

(ii) 3x + 10 > 2 + x + 4

Comments

The two parts are unrelated (unusually for STEP questions), except that they deal with inequalities. Both
parts need care, since they contain traps for the unwary.

In part (i) you have to watch out when you multiply an inequality: if the thing you multiply by is
negative then the inequality reverses. You might find sketching a graph helpful.

In part (ii) you have to consider the possibility that your algebraic manipulations have created extra
                                                                        
spurious solutions. It is worth (after you have finished the question) sketching the graphs of 3x + 10
                                                                        
and 2 + x + 4 just to see what is going on. You can get the latter graph by translations of x (and
          
you can get y = x by reflecting y = x in the line y = x ). I would have drawn them for you in the2

post-mortem overleaf had there been room.

In fact, a solution relying on sketches for part (ii) is probably preferable to my solution. With the sketches
                                               
to hand, you only have to solve the equation 3x + 10 = 2 + x + 4 and then look at your sketches to

see what range of values of x you need, thereby saving much anguish.17

17 Now I look at it again, it seems to me that the last sentence of my solution (`Therefore the inequality holds ...') is a bit suspect
   without sketches to show that the inequality actually does hold.

Solution to problem 17

(i) We would like to multiply both sides of the inequality by x in order to obtain a nice cubic expression.
However, we have to allow for the possibility that x is negative (which would reverse the inequality).
One way of dealing with this is to consider the cases x > 0 and x < 0 separately.

For x > 0, we multiply the whole equation by x without changing the direction of the inequality:

                              1 + 2x - x2 > 2  x + 2x2 - x3 > 2
                                                 x
                                                     x3 - 2x2 - x + 2 < 0

                                          (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2) < 0

                                          1 < x < 2,                                                 ()

discarding the possibility x < -1, since we have assumed that x > 0.

The easiest way of obtaining the result () from the previ-                     y

ous line is to sketch the graph of (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2) < 0 .

For x < 0, we must reverse the inequality when we multi-

ply by x so in this case, (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2) > 0, which                 -1     12x
gives -1 < x < 0.

In the sketch on the right, the values of x for which the                      y = x3 - 2x2 - x + 2
inequality holds are shown as bold lines.                                             y

The smart way to do x > 0 and x < 0 in one step is to                      -1 1 2 x
multiply by x2 (which is never negative and hence never
changes the direction of the inequality) and analyse

x(x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2) < 0. Again, a sketch is useful.                       y = x4 - 2x3 - x2 + 2x

                                                                
(ii) First square both sides of the inequality 3x + 10 > 2 + x + 4 :

                                                                           
             3x + 10 > 4 + 4 x + 4 + (x + 4) i.e. x + 1 > 2 x + 4 .

Note that both sides of the original inequality are positive or zero (i.e. non-negative), so the direction of
                                                                                                                     

the inequality is not changed by squaring. Now consider the new inequality x + 1 > 2 x + 4 . If both
sides are non-negative, that is if x > -1 , we can square both sides again without changing the direction
of the inequality. But, if x < -1 , the inequality cannot be satisfied since the right-hand side is always
non-negative. Squaring gives

                                   x2 + 2x + 1 > 4(x + 4) i.e. (x - 5)(x + 3) > 0 .

Thus, x > 5 or x < -3. However, we must reject x < -3 because of the condition x > -1 . Therefore the
inequality holds for x > 5 .

Post-mortem

The spurious result x < -3 at the end of part (ii) arises through loss of information in the process of

squaring: if you square an expression, you lose its sign. After squaring twice, the resulting inequality
                                                                  
is the same as would have resulted from (3x + 10) < 2 - (x + 4) and it is to this inequality that

- 310  x < -3 is a solution.

to hold.

Comments

The idea behind the first part is to obtain an inequality by considering a certain graph. In the second
part, we again use graphs to obtain an inequality, which this time holds subject to a different inequality.
For the sketch in the first part it is not necessary to do more than think about the behaviour for x large
and positive, and for x large and negative, and the points at which the graph crosses the x-axis.
For the second part, you should also have a sketch or sketches in mind. The argument is very similar to
that of the first part, except that it also tests understanding of the meaning of the terms necessary and
sufficient. For this, it is probably best to use  notation.
To show that g2 > 4h is not a necessary condition for the inequality (g - k)2 > 3(h - gk) to hold, you just
have to give an example (the simpler the better) for which (g - k)2 > 3(h - gk) but g2  4h.

Solution to problem 18

From the sketch, we see that f (x) has two turning points, so                                                              y
the equation f (x) = 0 has two real roots.                                                                       p qr x
Now

        f (x) = (x - p)(x - q)(x - r)
              = x3 - (p + q + r)x2 + (qr + rp + pq)x - pqr

so at a turning point

        f (x) = 3x2 - 2(p + q + r)x + (qr + rp + pq) = 0 .                                                          y = (x - p)(x - q)(x - 3)

Using the condition `b2 > 4ac' for this quadratic to have two
real roots gives the required result:

                  4(p + q + r)2 > 12(qr + rp + pq) .

For the second part, we can use a similar argument. First note that if the quadratic equation x2 +gx+h =
0 has two distinct real roots then the cubic equation (x2 + gx + h)(x - k) = 0 has three roots, at least two
of which are distinct. Thus

             g2 > 4h  (x2 + gx + h)(x - k) = 0 has at least two distinct roots
                         (x2 + gx + h)(x - k) has at least two distinct turning points (draw graphs!)
                         x3 + (g - k)x2 + (h - gk)x - hk has at least two distinct turning points
                         3x2 + 2(g - k)x + (h - gk) = 0 has two distinct roots
                         4(g - k)2 > 12(h - gk) as required.

Thus g2 > 4h is a sufficient condition for this inequality to hold.

Why is it not necessary? That is to say, why is it too strong a condition? The reason is that both turning
points could be above the x-axis or both could be below (not one on either side which was the origin of
the inequality). Saying this would get all the marks. Or you could give a counterexample: for example,
g = 2, h = 1 and k = 1000.

Post-mortem

When I set this question, I got considerable satisfaction from the way that seemingly obscure inequalities

are derived from understanding simple graphs and the quadratic formula. It was only when preparing

this book that I realised that they are, disappointingly, not at all obscure.

The inequality of the first part is equivalent to (q -r)2 +(r-p)2 +(p-q)2 > 0, the inequality coming from

the fact that squares of real numbers are non-negative and in this case the given condition p < q < r

means that the expression is strictly positive (not equal to zero).

If we rewrite the second inequality as (k + 12 g)2 + 3( 14 g2 - h) > 0 we see that it certainly holds if

(  1  g2  -  h)  >  0  ,  as  expected.  This  is  not  a  necessary  condition:  it  also  holds  if  (  1  g2  -  h)  <  0  provided  k  is
   4                                                                                                      4

Comments

This nice little question shows why it is a good idea to ban calculators from some mathematics exami-
nations -- though I notice that my calculator can't work out 210000.

When I was at school, before electronic calculators were invented, we had to spend quite a lot of time in
year 8 (I think) doing extremely tedious calculations by logarithms. We were provided with a book of
tables of four-figure logarithms and lots of uninteresting numbers to multiply or divide. The book also
had tables of trigonometric functions. When it came to antilogging, to get the answer, we had to use the
tables backwards, since no tables of inverse logarithms (exponentials) were provided.

A logarithm (to base 10, as always in this question) consists of two parts: the characteristic which is the
number before the decimal point and the mantissa which is the number after the decimal point. It is the
mantissa that gives the significant figures of the number that has been logged; the characteristic tells you
where to put the decimal point. The important property of logs to base 10 is that A  10n and A  10m
have the same mantissa, so log tables need only show the mantissa.

The characteristic of a number greater than 1 is non-negative but the characteristic of a number less than
1 is negative. The rules for what to do in the case of a negative characteristic were rather complicated:
you couldn't do ordinary arithmetic because the logarithm consisted of a negative characteristic and a
positive mantissa. In ordinary arithmetic, the number -3.4 means -3 - 0.4 whereas the corresponding
situation in logarithms, normally written 3.4 , means -3 + 0.4 . Instead of explaining this, the teacher
gave a complicated set of rules, which just had to be learned -- not the right way to do mathematics.

This question is all about calculating mantissas and there are no negative characteristics, I'm happy to
say.
56 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 19

(i) For the very first part, we have

log 2 + log 5 = log 10 = 1, so log 5 = 1 - 0.301029996 = 0.699 (3 d.p.)

and

log 6 = log 2 + log 3 = 0.778 (3 d.p.).

Now we have to show that

                                         5  1047 < 3100 < 6  1047 .                         ()

Taking logs preserves the inequalities (because log x is an increasing function), so we need to show that

                                      47 + log 5 < 100 log 3 < 47 + log 6

i.e. that

                                      47 + 0.699 < 47.7121 < 47 + 0.778

which is true. We see from () that the first digit of 3100 is 5 .

(ii) To find the first digit of these numbers, we use the method of part (i).

We have (to 3 d.p.)
log 21000 = 1000 log 2 = 301.030 = 301 + 0.030 < 301 + log 2
Thus 10301 < 21000 < 10301  2 and the first digit of 21 000 is 1 .

Similarly,
log 210 000 = 10 000 log 2 = 3010.29996 < 3010 + log 2, so the first digit of 210 000 is 1 .

Finally,
log 2100 000 = 30102 + 0.9996 (4 d.p.) and
log 9 = 2 log 3 = 0.95 (2 d.p.), so the first digit of 2100 000 is 9 .

Although the ideas in this question are really quite elementary, you needed to understand them deeply.
You should feel pleased with yourself it you get this one out.
Note that in part (i) I started with (), the result I was trying to prove and then showed it is true. This is
of course dangerous. But provided you keep writing `We have to prove that ... ' or `RTP' (Required To
Prove) you should not get muddled between what you have proved and what you are trying to prove.

Problem 20: Cosmological models                                                                                    ()

In a cosmological model, the radius R of the universe is a function of the age t of the universe.
The function R satisfies the three conditions:

R(0) = 0, R(t) > 0 for t > 0,    R(t) < 0 for t > 0,                                                               ()

where R denotes the second derivative of R. The function H is defined by
                                                                R(t)

                                                      H(t) = R(t) .
(i) Sketch a graph of R(t). By considering a tangent to the graph, show that t < 1 .

                                                                                                             H(t)

                                                  a
(ii) Observations reveal that H(t) = t , where a is constant. Derive an expression for R(t).

       What range of values of a is consistent with the three conditions ()?

(iii) Suppose, instead, that observations reveal that H(t) = bt-2, where b is constant. Show that
       this is not consistent with conditions () for any value of b.
       Note: xe-x  0 as x   for any constant .

                                                                                                                                2001 Paper I

Comments

The sketch just means any graph starting at the origin and increasing, but with decreasing gradient. The
second part of (i) needs a bit of thought (where does the tangent intersect the x-axis?) so don't despair
if you don't see it immediately. Parts (ii) and (iii) are perhaps easier than part (i).

Solution to problem 20                                                       y

(i) The figure shows the curve y = R(t) and the tan-                                          y = R(t)
gent to the curve, which meets the t axis.
The height of the right-angled triangle in the figure                                   R(t)
is R(t) and the slope of the hypotenuse is R (t). The
length of the base is therefore R(t)/R (t), i.e. 1/H(t).                             t                  t
The figure shows that the tangent to the graph for
t > 0 intersects the negative t-axis, so 1/H(t) > t.                         1/H(t)

(ii) One way to proceed is to integrate the differential equation:

H(t) = a  R (t) = a     R (t) dt =   a dt  ln R(t) = a ln t + constant  R(t) = Ata .
          t R(t) t      R(t)         t

The first two conditions () are satisfied if a > 0 and A > 0. For the third condition, we have R (t) =
a(a - 1)Ata-1 which is negative provided a < 1. The range of a is therefore 0 < a < 1.

(iii) The obvious way to do this just follows part (ii). This time, we have

b R (t) b               R (t) dt =   t2b dt  ln R(t) = - bt + constant  R(t) = Ae-b/t .
H(t) = 2   = 2          R(t)
t R(t) t

Thus R (t) = H(t)R(t) = Abt-2e-b/t . Clearly A > 0 since R(t) > 0 for t > 0 so R (t) > 0 provided
b > 0. Furthermore R(0) = 0 (think about this!), so only the condition R (t) < 0 remains to be checked.
Differentiating R (t) gives

           R (t) = Ab(-2t-3)e-b/t + Abt-2e-b/t(bt-2) = Abt-4e-b/t(-2t + b)

This is positive when t < 12 b, which contradicts the condition R < 0 .
Instead of solving the differential equation, we could proceed as follows. We have

          R = bt-2  R = bRt-2  R = bR t-2 - 2bRt-3 = b2t-4R - 2bRt-3 = b(b - 2t)t-4R .
           R
This is positive when t < 12 b, which contradicts the condition R < 0.

Post-mortem

The interpretation of the conditions in () of the question is as follows. The first condition R(0) = 0 says
that the universe started from zero radius -- in fact, from the `big bang'.

The second condition says that the universe is expanding. This was one of the key discoveries in cos-
mology in the last century. The quantity H(t) is called Hubble's constant (though it varies with time). It
measures the rate of expansion of the universe. Its reciprocal is the Hubble time. The present-day value
of the Hubble time has been a matter of great debate but it seems to be about 14.4 billion years, greater
than the age of the universe (as calculated using cosmological models of this sort) by about 0.5 billion
years.

The last condition says that the expansion of the universe is slowing down. This is expected on physical
grounds because of the gravitational attraction of galaxies on one another. However, current observa-
tions indicate that the expansion of the universe is speeding up, and this is thought to be due to the
presence of dark energy.

Problem 21: Melting snowballs  ()

Frosty the snowman is made from two uniform spherical snowballs, initially of radii 2R and 3R.
The smaller (which is his head) stands on top of the larger. As each snowball melts, its volume
decreases at a rate which is directly proportional to its surface area, the constant of proportion-
ality being the same for each snowball. During melting, the snowballs remain spherical and
uniform. When Frosty is half his initial height, show that the ratio of his volume to his initial
volume is 37 : 224 .
What is this ratio when Frosty is one tenth of his initial height?

                                                                                                                                1991 Paper I

Comments

To start with, you have to set up a differential equation which gives the radii of the snowballs as a
function of time. Don't worry if you have never solved a differential equation: you will be able to solve
this one. Having solved it, you have to evaluate the constant of integration from the information in the
question.
Setting up and solving the differential equation is not difficult in itself, but it is necessary to think what
variables you want to use and then go through a number of steps in the dark, without any reassurance
from the question.

Solution to problem 21

For either snowball, the rate of change of volume, call it v, at any time is related to the surface area a by

                                                             dv = -ka , ()
                                                              dt
where k is a positive constant. For a sphere of radius r, this becomes

                                                     ddt ( 34 r3) = -k(4r2) .

We can write d(r3) as 3r2 dr , so equation () is equivalent to (cancelling the factor of 4r2)
                    dt              dt

                                                                 dr = -k .
                                                                 dt

Thus r = -kt + C, where C is a constant of integration.

Initially, Frosty's head has radius 2R and his body has radius 3R, so the equations for the radii of the
head and body at time t are respectively

                                           r = -kt + 2R and r = -kt + 3R.

Frosty's height h is twice the sum of these radii, i.e. h = 2(-2kt + 5R), which falls to half its original
value of 10R when kt = 54 R. At this time, the radii of the head and body are 34 R and 74 R, so the ratio of
his volume to his initial volume is

                                    ( 43 ) ( 34 R)3 + ( 43 ) ( 74 R)3 = ( 34 )3 + ( 74 )3 = 37 .
                                    (   4  )  (2R)3  +  (  4  )  (3R)3      23 + 33           224
                                        3                  3

When Frosty is just R high, all that remains of him, since kt > 2R, is the body, which is a sphere of

radius  12 R.  The  ratio  of  his  volume    to  his   original  volume    is  just   1   .
                                                                                      240

Post-mortem

As mentioned in the comments section, there is not a lot for you to do in this question, but it is a lot for
you to do entirely on your own.
The key is to transcribe the words in the question into mathematics, the obvious starting point being
equation ().
The original question had a different rider18, asking about the maximum rate of change of volume with
respect to area. I didn't much like this, because it seemed to be a new and not very interesting idea. My
rider relates directly to the previous part, and requires a tiny bit of extra thought (a trap, some would
say, but it is only a trap if you are on autopilot).

18 The term rider seems a bit old-fashioned now. It referred to the final part at the end of an examination question in the days when
   examination questions often consisted of a relatively straightforward first part, perhaps the proof of a theorem, followed by a
   more tricky part extending or applying the first part.

Comments

The symbol  in the first paragraph means `much greater than', so for the second sketch k is a large
number.

This is a good question. In part (i) you are told what to do (in not-very-easy stages) and part (ii) tests
your understanding of what you have done and why you have done it by asking you to apply the
method to a different but essentially similar problem.
In the first paragraph, you have to see how the function tank  changes when k increases. You need only
a rough sketch to show that you have understood the important point. This should be done by thought,
not by means of a calculator.

If you are stuck with the integral of the second paragraph, you might like to think in terms of a recur-
rence formula, i.e. a formula relating I2n+1 and I2n-1 (in the obvious notation).
The series derived in part (ii) for 14  is usually called Leibniz's formula, although the general series for
tan-1 x was written down by Gregory in 1671, two years before Leibniz. It was one of the first explicit
formulae for , though Wallis had obtained a product formula in 1655 using a method similar to the
method of this question, using sink x in the integral. Previously, the value of  could only be estimated
geometrically, by (for example) approximating the circumference of a circle by the edges of an inscribed

                                                           
regular polygon. Using a square gives   2 2.

Solution to problem 22

For 0  tan  < 14  , we have tan  < 1, so that the curve                                                              y
y = tank  is close to zero (i.e. much smaller than 1) when
                                                                                                                                 k=1
k is large. This is illustrated in the figure which shows three                                                                     k=2 k=9

cases: for k = 1 the graph is mildly curved; for larger k the

graph hugs the x-axis before taking off. The graphs all pass

through  the  point  (  1  ,  1).
                        4

(i) To evaluate the integral, let                           1                                                                                
                                                                                                                                               ()
                                             I2n+1 =          4 2n+1
                                                                tan  d .

                                                           0

We shall express I2n+1 in terms of I2n-1 using the relation tan2  = sec2  - 1:

                         1                                                2n-1  1 1

                            4 2n-1 2
         I2n+1 =              tan             (-1 + sec ) d = -I2n-1 + u                                       du = -I2n-1 + 2n .

                           0                                                                            0

To evaluate the second integral, set u = tan  so that du = sec2  d .

Repeating the process gives

I2n+1 = -I2n-1 + 1 = I2n-3 - 1 + 1 =    = (-1)nI1 + 1 - 1 +    + (-1)n+1 1 .
                        2n                   2(n - 1) 2n                                                   2n 2(n - 1)                       2

The above sum (starting with 1/(2n)) is the same as that in () overleaf, so it only remains to evaluate

I1, corresponding to n = 0 in ():

                                     1                            14                                              1
                                          4                                                                       2

                              I1 =           tan  d = - ln(cos )  0    = - ln(1/                           2)  =     ln 2 ,

                                    0

as required.

We deduce the expression () overleaf for ln 2 using the first line of the question. When n is very large,

I2n+1 is very small, being the area under a graph which is almost zero for almost all of the range of

integration. In the limit n  , we set I2n+1 = 0 in () which leads immediately to ().

(ii) To obtain the formula for 14 , we follow the above method using I2n instead of I2n+1. This time we

have to calculate I0:                                          41  
                                                        0 I0 = 1 d = 4 .

Post-mortem

You might think that the method of obtaining the formula for 14  in this question is rather indirect; one
could instead just integrate the formula

                                             d tan-1 x  =  1    2 = 1-x +x -렁24                                                               ()

                                             dx            1+x

term by term and get the result immediately by setting x = 1. The virtue of the method used in the
question is that it gives an explicit form (an integral) of the remainder after n terms of the series. We
were able to show, by means of a sketch, that the remainder tends to zero as n tends to infinity; in other
words, we showed that the series converges. Although the sketch method of proof is a bit crude, it can
easily be made more rigorous once the concept of integration is more carefully defined. On the other
hand, integrating () and setting x = 1 is a bit delicate, since the series only converges for x2 < 1.

You don't need to know anything about ellipses to do this question.
When this question was set it seemed too easy. But quite a high proportion of the candidates made no
real progress. Of course, it is not easy to keep a cool head under examination conditions; but surely it
is obvious that either x or y has to be eliminated from the two equations for the ellipses; and having
decided that it is obvious which one to eliminate.
It is worth thinking about how many points of intersection of the ellipses we are expecting: a sketch
might help if you know what shapes the ellipses are.

Solution to problem 23

First we have to find the intersections of the two ellipses by solving the simultaneous equations

                                     (x + 2)2 + 2y2 = 18                                           (1)

                                     9(x - 1)2 + 16y2 = 25 .                                       (2)

We can eliminate y by multiplying equation (1) by 8 and subtracting equation (2), so that at the intersec-
tions

                                               8(x + 2)2 - 9(x - 1)2 = 144 - 25

i.e.
                                                         x2 - 50x + 96 = 0

i.e.

                                                       (x - 2)(x - 48) = 0 .

The two possible values for x at the intersections are therefore 2 and 48.
Next we find the values of y at the intersection. Taking x = 2 and substituting into equation (1) gives
16 + 2y2 = 18, so y = 1. Taking x = 48 gives 502 + 2y2 = 18 which has no (real) roots. Thus there are
two points of intersection, at (2, 1) and (2, -1).
Now we go after the circle. Suppose that a circle through the points of intersection has centre (p, q) and
radius R. Then the equation of the circle is

                                                    (x - p)2 + (y - q)2 = R2 .

Setting (x, y) = (2, 1) and (x, y) = (2, -1) gives two equations:.

                               (2 - p)2 + (1 - q)2 = R2 , (2 - p)2 + (-1 - q)2 = R2 .

Subtracting the two equations gives q = 0 (it is obvious anyway, because of the symmetry of both ellipses
under reflections in the x axis, that the centre of the circle must lie on the y axis). Thus the equation of
any circle passing through the intersections is

                                                 (x - p)2 + y2 = (2 - p)2 + 1 ,

which simplifies to the given result with p = a .

Post-mortem

As commented earlier, there really wasn't much to this question apart from solving simultaneous equa-
tions and quadratic equations. I suppose that the daunting feature is that very little help is given in the
way of intermediate steps of answers.
Another daunting feature is the unexplained parameter a in the equation of the circle. Two ellipses can
intersect in four points, three points (if the ellipses touch rather than intersect at one of the points), two
points, one point or not at all.
In general, we wouldn't expect to be able to draw a circle through four given points. We would expect
exactly one circle through three given points (not lying on a line), but a whole family of circles through
any two points. Our ellipses intersect in two points, which is why the circle depends on a parameter a.

Comments

There is quite a lot in this question, but it is one of the best STEP questions on basic material that I came
across.
First, you have to find f (x) . The very first part (giving a form of f (x)) did not occur in the original
STEP question. This particular expression is extremely helpful when if comes to finding the value of
f (x) at the stationary point. In the actual exam, a handful of candidates successfully found a general
expression for f (x) in terms of x then evaluated it at the stationary point: first-class work.
You should find that the value of f (x) at the stationary point can be expressed in the form (   )f (x) ,
where the factor in the brackets is quite simple and always negative, so that the nature of the stationary
point depends only on the sign of f (x) . Actually, this is intuitively obvious: f (0) = f (1) = 0 so the one
stationary point with 0 < x < 1 must be, for example, a maximum if f (x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1 .

For the sketches, you really have only to think about the behaviour of f (x) when |x| is large and the sign
of f (x) between x = 0 and x = 1. That allows you to piece together the graph, knowing that there is
only one stationary point between x = 0 and x = 1 . You should then be able to identify the four cases
referred to.
Note that, very close to x = 0 , f (x)  xm(-1)n so it is easy to see how the graph there depends on n
and m ; you can use this to check that you have got the graphs right.

Post-mortem

Don't read this until you have worked through the question!

You may have noticed a little carelessness in the first line of the solution: what happens in the logarith-

mic differentiation if any of f (x) or x or x-1 are negative? The answer is that it doesn't matter. One way

to deal with the problem of logs with negative arguments is to put modulus signs everywhere using the

correct result  d                                            f (x)

                dx ln |f (x)| = f (x) .

If you are not sure of this, try it on f (x) = x taking the two cases x > 0 and x < 0 separately.

A more sophisticated way of dealing with logs with negative arguments is to note that ln(-f (x)) =
ln f (x) + ln(-1). We don't have to worry about ln(-1) because it is a constant (of some sort) and so
won't affect the differentiation. Actually, a value of ln(-1) can be obtained by taking logs of Euler's
famous formula ei = -1 giving ln(-1) = i .
66 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 24

The first result can be established by differentiating f (x) directly, but the neat way to do it is to start with

ln f (x) :

                                     f (x) m n                       (        mn          )

            ln f (x) = m ln x + n ln(x - 1) = f (x) = x + x - 1 = f (x) = x - 1 - x f (x) ,

as required. Writing this as f (x) = (m(x - 1) + nx)xm-1(x - 1)n-1, we see that f (x) has stationary

points at x = 0 and x = 1 (since m - 1 > 0 and n - 1 > 0) and when m(x - 1) + nx = 0. Solving this last
                                    m

equation for x gives x = m + n , which lies between 0 and 1 since m and n are positive.
Next we calculate f (x) . Starting with

                                        (           )
                                     f (x) = m - n f (x) ,
                                           x 1-x

we obtain                 (                )        (             )
            f (x) = - x2 m - (1 - x)2 n f (x) + mx - n 1 - x f (x) .

At a stationary point, the second of these two terms is zero because f (x) = 0 , leaving

                                     (                 )
                             f (x) = - x2 m - (x - 1)2 n f (x) .

The bracketed expression is negative so at a stationary point f (x) < 0 if f (x) > 0 and f (x) > 0 if
f (x) < 0.

The sign of f (x) for 0 < x < 1 is the same as the sign of (x - 1)n, since xm > 0 when x > 0. For the
stationary point in the interval 0 < x < 1, (x - 1)n > 0 if n is even and (x - 1)n < 0 if n is odd. Thus
f (x) < 0 if n is even and f (x) > 0 if n is odd, which is the required result.

The four cases to sketch are determined by whether m and n are even or odd. The easiest way to
understand what is going on is to consider the graphs of xm and (x - 1)n separately, then try to join
them up at the stationary point between 0 and 1. If m is odd, then x = 0 is a point of inflection, but if
m is even it is a maximum or minimum according to the sign of (x - 1)n. You should also think about
the behaviour for large |x|. All the various bits of information (including the nature of the turning point
investigated above) should all piece neatly together.

Comments

There is quite a lot to this question, so  even though none of it is particularly difficult (very surprising
to find it on Paper I). The most common mistake in finding the equation of the tangent is to muddle the
y and x that occur in the equation of the line (y = mx + c) with the coordinates of the point at which the
tangent meets the curve, getting `constants' m and c that depend on x . I'm sure you wouldn't make this
rather elementary mistake normally, but it is surprising what people do under examination conditions.

The reason for sketching the curve lies in the last parts: the shape of the curve relative to the straight
line provides the inequality.

The note at the end of the question had to be given because integrals of that form (giving inverse trigono-
metric functions) are not in the A-level Mathematics specifications. Volumes of revolution are no longer
in the A-level Mathematics specifications and so they are no longer in the STEP 1 specification. They are
now included in the STEP 3 specification.

Your sketch should show a graph which has                                        1

the x-axis for large x. The extra line in my
sketch is the tangent to the graph from the                                      21 
point (0, 1) which is required later.                                                                   

                                                                                                   1  x
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                          

First we find the equation of the tangent to the curve y = (1 + x2)-1 at the point (p, q) . The gradient of

the curve at the point (p, q) is -2p(1 + p2)-2, i.e. -2pq2 , so the equation of the tangent is

                                                         y = -2pq2x + c

where c is given by q = -2pq2p + c . This line is supposed to pass through the point (0, 1) , so 1 = c .
Thus 1 = q + 2p2q2, or (replacing q with 1/(1 + p2))

                                                             1             2p2
                                                   1 = 1 + p2 + (1 + p2)2

which simplifies to

                                          (1 + p2)2 = 1 + 3p2 i.e. p4 = p2 .

The  only  positive  solution   is  p  =  1,  so  the  equation    of  the    line  is  y  =  -  1  x  +  1  .
                                                                                                 2

We can check that this line does not meet the curve again by solving the equation

                                                         x                 1
                                                       - +1=                  2.
                                                         2          1+x

Multiplying by (1 + x)2 gives

                                (1 - 12 x)(1 + x2) = 1 i.e. x3 - 2x2 + x = 0 .

Factorising shows that x = 1 and x = 0 satisfy this equation (these are the known roots, x = 1 being a
double root corresponding to the tangency) and that there are no more roots.

The area under the curve for 0  x  1 is 14  as given. The sketch shows that this area is greater than

the  area  under  the  tangent  line   for    0    x     1,  which     is  1  +  1  (the   area     of  the     rectangle  plus  the  area  of

the triangle above it). Comparing this with 14  gives the required result.

Comparison gives the required result.

Post-mortem

As I said before, no step of this question is particularly difficult, but lots of different ideas are required.
The last part is very challenging, because you have to do and compare two separate volume integrals
without any intermediate steer at all. You should be very pleased if you made good progress with it.
The important lesson to learn from this is that perseverance will eventually pay off.

Comments

This is a model for a perfect STEP question: you are told how to do the first part, and you have to adapt
the idea on your own for the later parts. Note the structure of the question: there is a `stem' (the first
paragraph) containing material that will be useful for both the later parts.

In the examination, candidates who were successful in parts (i) and (ii) nearly always started off with
the statement `Now let I =    and J =    '. If you are stuck with part (ii), the choice of significant
numbers (3, 4 and 25) should provide a clue.

When you arrive at an answer for part (i), you will of course check that it agrees with the given result in
the opening paragraph when a = 12  and p = q = 1.
You will no doubt have noticed the restriction 0  a < 34  given in the first paragraph (and also the
restrictions on p and q in part (i)). You should try to work out its purpose because it might provide an
insight into the method of tackling the question, though in this case it doesn't.

For the first part, we regard the two integrals essentially as a pair of simultaneous equations, adding

and subtracting to simplify them. We have

(in the second integral, the numerator is the derivative of the denominator). Adding these equations

gives the required expression for 2I .                  1

Now we solve these two equations simultaneously for I:

                                                    2               q

0 (ii) This time, let I = 3 sin x + 4 cos x + 25 0 dx and J = 3 sin x + 4 cos x + 25 dx . Then

                    4I + 3J =            21  4 cos x + 3 sin x + 25 
                                                                          dx =

Post-mortem

I very much like this question. The first part appeared on STEP Paper I in 1995 (the second part of the
1995 question was an integral completely unrelated to the first part -- that wouldn't happen now) and
I was completely taken by surprise.

In order to use it again for STEP in 2002, I added parts (i) and (ii). It took me some time to think of
a suitable extension. I was disappointed to find that the basic idea is more or less a one-off: there are
very few denominators, besides the ones given, that lead to integrands amenable to this trick. But I was
pleased with what I came up with. The question leads you through the opening paragraph and the extra
parts depend very much on your having understood why the opening paragraph works. The reason for
restriction 0  a < 3/4 is that the denominator should not be 0 for any value of x in the range of

                                                                                                     
integration -- otherwise, the integral is undefined. Writing sin x + cos x = 2 sin(x + /4) shows that
the denominator is first zero when x = 3/4 .

You might like to think how you would evaluate these integrals without using the trick method of this
question. Perhaps the easiest way is to use the substitution t = tan( 12 x) which converts the denominator
to a quadratic in x .

Comments

This result is both surprising and pleasing.

The question looks difficult, but you don't have to go very far before you come across something to
substitute into the given arithmetic mean/geometric mean (AM/GM) inequality.

To obtain the relationship between the coefficients and the roots for part (i), you need to write the quartic
equation in the form (x - p)(x - q)(x - r)(x - s) = 0 .

Watch out for the condition in the given form of the arithmetic/geometric inequality that the numbers
are distinct: you will have to show that any numbers (or algebraic expressions) you use in the inequality
are distinct.

I puzzled over this question for ages, not understanding the idea behind it19.

It will be clear from the proof that it can be generalised to any equation of the form

                                   N N-1 (N )             N -k k
                        x+                       k (-ak) x = 0 ,

                                   k=0

where the numbers ak are distinct and positive, which has positive distinct roots.

Eventually, I realised that the result of the question has really nothing to do with quartic equations,
though quartic equations provide a neat method of proof. The inequalities, which apply to any positive
numbers, form a sequence interpolating between the AM and the GM. These inequalities were first
derived by Newton and Maclaurin in the 17th century but don't seem to be very well known now.

19 I mentioned this in a talk I gave to sixth formers, and later saw irritatingly on www.thestudentroom.co.uk a comment to the
   effect that `even Dr Siklos can't do this STEP question'. Of course I could do it; I wanted to understand it, as I hope you do too.

Solution to problem 27

(i) First write

                          f (x)  (x - p)(x - q)(x - r)(x - s)

where p , q , r and s are the four roots of the equation (known to be real, positive and distinct). Multi-
plying out the brackets and comparing with x4 - 4ax3 + 6b2x2 - 4c3x + d4 shows that pqrs = d4 and
pqr + qrs + rsp + spq = 4c3 .

The required result, c > d , follows immediately by applying the AM/GM inequality to the positive real
numbers pqr, qrs, rsp and spq :

              c3 = pqr + qrs + rsp + spq > [(pqr)(qrs)(rsp)(spq)]1/4 = [p3q3r3s3]1/4 = [d12]1/4 .
                                   4

Taking the cube root (c and d are positive) preserves the inequality.

The AM/GM inequality at the beginning of the question is stated only for the case when the numbers are
distinct (though in fact it holds provided at least two of the numbers are distinct). To use the inequality as
above, we must therefore show that no two of pqr , qrs , rsp and spq are equal. This follows immediately
from the fact that the roots are distinct and non-zero. For if, for example, pqr = qrs then qr(p - s) = 0
which means that q = 0 , r = 0 or p = s, all of which are ruled out.

(ii) The polynomial f (x) is cubic so it has three zeros (roots). These are at the turning points of f (x),
which lie between the zeros of f (x) and are therefore distinct and positive.

Now

                          f (x) = 4x3 - 12ax2 + 12b2x - 4c3,

so at the turning points

                                     x3 - 3ax2 + 3b2x - c3 = 0 .

Suppose that the roots of this cubic equation are u , v and w, all real, distinct and positive. Then compar-
ing x3 - 3ax2 + 3b2x - c3 = 0 and (x - u)(x - v)(x - w) shows that c3 = uvw and 3b2 = vw + wu + uv .

The required result, b > c , follows immediately by applying the AM/GM inequality to the positive
distinct numbers vw , wu and uv .
(iii) Apply similar arguments to f (x)/12.

Post-mortem

The general inequalities mentioned in the comments above are interesting. For example, for four num-
bers a1, a2, a3 and a4, we define

                 S1 = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 ,  S2 = a2a3 + a3a1 + a1a2 + a4a1 + a4a2 + a4a3 ,
                                   4                                        6

                 S3 = a2a3a4 + a1a3a4 + a1a2a4 + a1a2a3               and S4 = a1a2a3a4 .
                                               4

Except for the denominators and alternating signs, Si is the coefficient of x4-i in the equation

(x - a1)(x - a2)(x - a3)(x - a4) = 0, but that doesn't matter. Maclaurin's inequalities are

                                           1  1          1

                                           S1  S 2 2  S 3 3  S 4 4 .

What is really surprising is that we proved the three stronger inequalities from the apparently weaker

                                                                             1

Problem 28: Fermat numbers                              ()

numbers have a common factor greater than 1.
Hence show that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Comments

Fermat (1601-1665) conjectured that every number of the form 22n + 1 is a prime number. F0 to F4 are
indeed prime, but Euler showed in 1732 that F5 (4294967297) is divisible by 641. As can be seen, Fermat
numbers get very big and not many more have been investigated; but those that have been investigated
have been found not to be prime numbers. It is now conjectured that in fact only a finite number of
Fermat numbers are prime numbers.

The Fermat numbers have a geometrical significance as well: Gauss proved that a regular polygon of n
sides can be inscribed in a circle using a Euclidean construction (i.e. only a straight edge and a compass)
if and only if n is a power of 2 times a product of distinct Fermat primes.

The very last part of this question, showing that the number of primes is infinite, is completely unex-
pected and delightful. It comes from Proofs from THE BOOK20, a set of proofs thought by Paul Erds to
be heaven-sent. Most of them are much less elementary this one. Erds was an extraordinarily prolific
mathematician. He had almost no personal belongings and no home21. He spent his life visiting other
mathematicians and proving theorems with them. He collaborated with so many people that every
mathematician is (jokingly) assigned an Erds number; for example, if you wrote a paper with someone
who wrote a paper with Erds, you are given the Erds number 2. Most mathematicians seem to have
an Erds number less than 8.

20 M. Aigler and G.M. Ziegler (Springer, 1999). The idea behind the proof was given by Christian Goldbach (1690-1764), who is
   best known for his conjecture that there are an infinite number of twin primes, that is, prime numbers that are two apart such as
   17 and 19.

   readable and interesting book.
74 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 28

To begin with, we have by direct calculation that F0 = 3 , F1 = 5 , F2 = 17 and F3 = 257, so it is easy to
verify () for k = 1, 2 and 3.
For the induction, we start by assuming that the result holds for k = m so that

                                     F0F1 . . . Fm-1 = Fm - 2 .

We need to show that this implies that the result holds for k = m + 1, i.e. that

                                     F0F1 . . . Fm = Fm+1 - 2 .                                   ()

Starting with the left-hand side of this equation, we have
      F0F1 . . . Fm-1Fm = (Fm - 2)Fm = (22m - 1)(22m ( + 1) = 22m )2 - 1 = 22m+1 - 1 = Fm+1 - 2,

as required. Since we know that the result holds for k = 1, the induction is complete.

To show that no two Fermat number have a common factor (other than 1), we proceed by contradiction.
Suppose p divides Fl and Fm, where l < m. Then p divides F0F1 . . . Fl . . . Fm-1 and therefore p divides
Fm - 2, by (), as well as Fm. But this is impossible: all Fermat numbers are odd so no number other
than 1 divides both Fm -2 and Fm. Hence no two Fermat numbers have a common factor greater than 1.

For the last part, note that every number can be written uniquely as a product of prime factors and that
because the Fermat numbers are co-prime, each prime can appear in at most one Fermat number. Thus,
since there are infinitely many Fermat numbers, there must be infinitely many primes.

Post-mortem

This question is largely about proof. The above solution has a proof by induction and a proof by contra-
diction. The last part could have been written as a proof by contradiction too.
The difficulty is in presenting the proof. It is not enough to understand your own proof: you have to be
able to set it out so that it is clear to the reader. This is a vital part of mathematics and its most useful
transferable skill.
At the meeting in which this question was first considered, one of the examiners said that he didn't
see the point of the question, since there is already a well-known proof (due to Euclid, possibly) that
there are infinitely many primes. As mentioned overleaf, this proof is due to Goldbach, and I could only
respond that if Goldbach thought it worthwhile, that was good enough for me.

Comments

If you haven't the faintest idea how to do the sum, then look at the first line of the solution; but don't
look without first having had a long think about it, picking up ideas from the form of the given answer.

Limits form an important part of first year university mathematics. The definition of a limit is one of the
basic ideas in analysis, which is the rigorous study of calculus. At the end of part (i), no such definition
is needed: you just see what happens when N gets very large (some terms get very small and eventually
go away).

Part (ii) looks as if it might be some new idea. Since this is STEP, you will probably realise that the new
series must be closely related to the series in part (i). The peculiar choice for a1 (= 29 ) should make
you suspect that the sum will come out to some nice round number (not in fact round in this case, but
straight and thin).

Having decided how to do the first part, please don't use the `cover up' rule unless you understand why
it works: mathematics at this level is not a matter of applying learned recipes. See the post-mortem for
more thoughts on this matter.
76 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 29

The given answer to the sum suggests partial fractions. It is difficult to think of any other way of starting,

so let's convert the general term of the series to partial fractions in the hope that something good might

happen. Set
                                                2n - 1  A + B + C , ()

                                          n(n + 1)(n + 2) n n + 1 n + 2

then use your favourite method to find A = - 12 , B = 3 and C = - 52 . Note that A + B + C = 0. The

series can now be written
     (                  )(                 )(                 )
        ABC                    ABC                     ABC
        1+2+3 + 2+3+4 + 3+4+5 +

                (    A         BC          )(          ABC                )(       AB                                                    C  )

     +    + N - 2 + N - 1 + N + N - 1 + N + N + 1 + N + N + 1 + N + 2 . ()

Now we collect up terms with the same denominators and find that all the terms in the series cancel,

except those with denominators 1, 2, N + 1 and N + 2. These exceptions sum to the required answer.

The  limit  as  N       is  3  since  the  other  two  terms  obviously  tend  to  zero.
                            4

For part (ii), we note that an = bn , where bn is the general term of the series in part (i). Thus
                                  an-1 bn-1

                               an bn                          a1          2/9 3

                                 = and                 an =         bn =  = 1.
                               a1 b1                   1 b1 1 1/6 4

Alternatively, we can write out the nth term explicitly:

Post-mortem

A small point of technique: equation () was made much clearer (and it saved writing) to stick with
A, B and C instead of using - 12 , 3 and - 52 . The method would not depend on the arithmetic values of
these constants.

There are various methods for finding A, B and C in ().

One is to set n = 1, n = 2 and n = 3 consecutively and obtain three simultaneous equations.
Another is to multiply up and simplify, giving 2n - 1 = (A + B + C)n2 + (3A + 2B + C)n + 2A. You
then equate coefficients of powers of n.

A better way is to multiply up without simplifying, giving 2n - 1 = A(n + 1)(n + 2) + Bn(n + 2) +
Cn(n + 1). You then choose values for n that give quick results: for example, setting n = -1 gives
B = 3 immediately. This is of course the method behind the iniquitous `cover-up rule'. Note that
the `equivalence' sign,  , indicates an identity (something that holds for all values of n) rather than an
equation to solve for n , so n doesn't have to be a positive integer (you could set n = - 12 if you fancied it).

I slightly simplified the first two parts of the question, which comprised the whole of the original STEP
question, and added the third part. This last part is conceptually tricky and very interesting: hence the
 rating.
It is a fairly standard technique in this sort of number theoretic problem to investigate whether the
equation balances: for example, if the left-hand side is even, then the right-hand side must also be even.
If this fails, then the equation can have no solutions.
78 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 30

(i) Simplifying gives m2(m - 18) = 54.
Both m2 and (m - 18) must divide 54, which is impossible since the only squares that divide 54 are 1
and 9, and neither m = 1 nor m = 3 satisfies m2(m - 18) = 54.
You could also argue that m - 18 must be positive so m  19 and m2  361 which is a contradiction.

(ii) The easiest method is a proof by contradiction. Suppose therefore that n is odd. The two terms on
the left-hand side are both odd, which means that the left-hand side is even. But the right-hand side is
odd so the equation cannot balance if n is odd.

Setting n = 2m gives

                         (2m - 6)3 + (2m)3 = (2m + 6)3.

Taking a factor of 23 out of each term leaves (m - 3)3 + m3 = (m + 3)3 which is the same as the equation
that was shown in part (i) to have no solutions.

(iii) First we show that n is even, dealing with the cases a odd and a even separately. The first case is n
odd and a odd. In that case, (n - a)3 is even, n3 is odd and (n + a)3 is even, so the equation does not
balance. In the second case, n is odd and a is even, the three terms are all odd and again the equation
does not balance. Therefore n cannot be odd.

Next, we investigate the case n is even and a odd. This time the three terms are odd, even and odd
respectively so there is no contradiction. But multiplying out the brackets and simplifying gives

                                     n2(n - 6a) = 2a3 .

Since n is even the left-hand side is divisible by 4, because of the factor n2 . That means that a3 is divisible
by 2 which cannot be the case since a is odd.

Now that we know n and a are both even, we can follow the method used in part (ii) and set n = 2m

and a = 2b . This gives

                         (2m - 2b)3 + (2m)3 = (2m + 2b)3

from which a factor of 23 can be cancelled from each term. Thus m and b satisfy the same equation as n
and a. They are therefore both even and we can repeat the process.

Repeating the process again and again will eventually result in an integer that is odd which will therefore
not satisfy the equation that it is supposed to satisfy: a contradiction. There is therefore no integer n that
satisfies (  ).

The last proof is an example of what is known as the method of infinite descent. It was used by Fermat
(1601 - 1665) to prove special cases of his Last Theorem22, which of course is exactly what you are doing
in this question. The method was probably invented by him and his faith in it sometimes led him astray.
It is even possible that he thought he could use it to prove his Last Theorem in full. In fact, the proof of
this theorem was only given in 1994 by Andrew Wiles; and it is 150 pages of pretty incomprehensible
modern mathematics.

22 The theorem says that the equation xn + yn = zn , where x , y , z and n are positive integers, can only hold if n = 1 or 2.

Comments

Quite a lot of different ideas are required for this question; hence .

The first hurdle is to decide what the constant K in the first part has to be in order to make the second
part work. You might try to maximise the integrand using calculus, but that would be the wrong thing
to do (you should find if you do this that the integrand has no turning point in the given range: it
increases throughout the range).

The next hurdle is the third displayed equation, which follows from the preceding result. Then there is

still more work to do.

It is not at all obvious that the series   N 1  (which is called the harmonic series) tends to infinity as N

                                          1n

increases. There are easier ways of proving this than the method used in this question, but this way tells

us two interesting things. First it tells us that the sum increases very slowly indeed: the first 1030 terms

only get to 100. Second it tells us that

                                                N 1
                                          0  n - ln N  1

                                                    1

for all N . (This is the third displayed equation in the question slightly rewritten.) Not only does the
sum diverge, it does so logarithmically. In fact, in the limit N  ,

                                                 N 1
                                                     n - ln N  

                                                  1

Solution to problem 31

Any sketch showing a squiggly curve all of which lies beneath the line x = K and above the x-axis will
do: area under curve (the integral) is less than the area of the rectangle (K).

Let's start the next part in the obvious way, by evaluating the integral.

               t       n
Noting that n - t = n - t - 1 , we have:

                       1 t                1( 1 1)       (              n   )  1

                       0 n(n - t)  dt =      - dt = ln                        -.
                                          0 n-t n          n-1 n

The largest value of the integrand in the interval [0, 1] occurs at t = 1, since the numerator increases as

t increases and the denominator decreases as t increases (remember that n > 1). Using the result of the

first paragraph gives       (             )

                          0  ln n n - 1 - 1n  1 n(n - 1) = 1 n - 1 - 1n .

Summing both sides from 2 to N and cancelling lots of terms in pairs gives

                                              N 1  1
                                     2 0  ln N - n  1 - N . ()

               1                                       N 1
Note that 1 - < 1. Since ln N   as N  , so also must                       (it differs from the logarithm by
               N 2n

less than 1).

 N Finally, rearranging the first inequality in () gives 1   N ln N , i.e. 1  ln N +1 . Setting N = 1030 ,
                                             2n                        1n

and using the inequalities 1000 < 1024 and e > 2 (or ln 2 < 1) gives:

               1030

               
                    1  ln(1030) + 1 < ln(102410) + 1 = 100 ln 2 + 1 < 100 ln e + 1 = 100 + 1 .

This question seems very daunting at first, because you are asked to prove a sequence of completely
unfamiliar results. However, you should learn from this question that if you keep cool and follow the
hints, explicit and implicit, you can achieve some surprisingly sophisticated results. You might think
that this situation is very artificial: in real life, you do not receive hints to guide you. But often in
mathematical research, hints are buried deep in the problem if only you can recognise them.

Comments

You will find that the change of variable in each case is clearly signalled: it is really only the denominator
of () that matters.

For the first integral, you do the obvious thing, but for the second and third integrals you have to be
quite ingenious to get the argument of the logs in a suitable form. Once you have got the idea for the
second integral, you should be able to see the connection with the third integral, but it would be hard to
do the third integral without having done the second. That's what I like about this question: one thing
leads to another.

I have written below the version of this question that was proposed by the setter, because I thought you
would be interested to see how a question evolves.

By changing to the variable y defined by

                                          y = 2x - 3 ,
                                                x+1

                            9

Note in particular the way that the ideas in the final draft are closely knit and better structured: the
first change of variable is strongly signalled but not explicit and the following parts, though based on
the same idea, require increasing ingenuity. The first draft required quite a jump to evaluate the second
integral.

Note also that the final integral of the first draft has an unpleasant contrived appearance, whereas the
the integrals of the final draft are rather pleasing: beauty matters to mathematicians.

                       0 (x + 3)2 ln x + 3 dx = 2 1/3 ln ydy = 2 1/3 y ln y - y ,

which gives the required answer. (The integral of ln y is a standard integral; it can be done by parts, first
substituting z = ln y, if you like.)

The second integral can be expressed as the sum of two integrals of the same form as the first integral,

since       ( x2 + 3x + 2 )                   (  (x + 1)(x + 2)  )        (  x+1    )  (  x+2   )

We have already done the first of these integrals. Using the substitution y = x + 2                in the second of
                                                                                          x+3
these integrals gives
                                    3/4
                                              ln y dy = 17 ln 3 - 13 ln 2 - 1 .

                                   2/3

For the final integral, note that

                                   (            )(               )(                 )
                                   ln x + 1 = ln x + 1 - ln x + 2 ,

For the first integral of the original version, the change of variable gives

                                              1 1             1              2
                                              5 1 y ln y dy = 90 ln 3 - 45 .
                                              3

I checked this using Wolfram Alpha. For the second integral, you have to guess the substitution. There

are plenty of clues, but the most obvious place to start is the log. The argument of the log can be

written as                                                 
                                                          2 z-5

                                                             .
                                                               z

It is now a bit of a leap in the dark (too much of a leap, I thought), but if we decide to convert this exactly
into the previous integral, we should take z = (x + 1)2 . And, magic (or contrived STEP question), it
works, giving the first integral almost exactly (note especially that the limits transform as they should).
The only difference is a factor of 2 so the answer is twice the previous answer.

A change of variable of the form () is called a linear fractional or Mbius transformation. It is of great
importance in the theory of the geometry of the complex plane.

You have to be sure of the definition of x2 - 2x + a to do this question. You might think that it
is ambiguous, because the square root could be positive or negative, but by convention it means the

                                  
positive square root. Thus x2 = |x| (not x ).

For the sketches, you just need the position of any stationary points, any other interesting points that the
graph passes through, behaviour as x   and any vertical asymptotes. It should not be necessary
in such a simple case to establish the nature of the stationary point(s). The sketches are not particularly
difficult, but they do need thought because they turn out to be rather different from the sketches of
polynomials or trigonometric functions that you are probably used to.

You should at some stage think about the conditions given on a . In fact, I doubt if many of you will
want to leave it there. It is clear that what the examiner would really have liked you to do is to sketch
C in the different cases that arise according to the value of a but was told that this would be too long
and/or difficult for the exam; but I am sure that this is what you will try to do (or maybe what you have
already done by the time you read this).

Please do not use your calculator (or Wolfram Alpha or Geogebra or Desmos23, etc) for these sketches,
except perhaps to check your answers: there is no point.

23 https://www.desmos.com/calculator is brilliant: you can use a slider to change the value of a; but please don't.

Solution to problem 33

First differentiate to find the stationary points:

                             dy (x2 - 2x + a) - x(x - 1)           a-x
             dx =                                             = (x2 - 2x + a) 23
                                     (x2  -  2x     +  a)  3
                                                           2

which is only zero when x = a. I've used the quotient rule, but the product rule is just as good.

                                                                                                    y
                                                            
(i) When a = 2, the stationary point is at (2, 2) (which can

be seen to be a maximum by evaluating the second derivative                                                             x
at x = a , though this is not necessary). The curve passes                                               2

through (0, 0). As x  , y  1; as x  -, y  -1.
                                                       x

(ii) When a = 1, we can rewrite y as |x - 1| . The modulus y
signs arise because the square root is taken to be positive (or

zero -- but that can be discounted here since it is in the de-

nominator). The graph is as before, except that the maximum

point has been stretched into a vertical asymptote (like a vol-                                          1x
canic plug) at x = 1 . Note that if |x| is much larger than a, it

doesn't really matter whether a = 1 or a = 2.

Post-mortem

The first thing to do after finishing the question is to try to understand the role of the parameter a . Part
(ii) above is the key. Writing

                                           f (x) = x2 - 2x + a = (x - 1)2 + a - 1 ,

we see that f (x) > 0 for all x if a > 1 but if a < 1 there are values of x for which f (x) < 0 . The borderline

value is a = 1, for which f (x)  0 and f (1) = 0 .
                                                             

If a < 1 , we find that f (x) = 0 when x = 1  1 - a and f (x) < 0 between these two values of x . The

significance of this is that the square root in the denominator of the function we are trying to sketch is
                                                                                                       
imaginary, so there is a gap in the graph between x = 1 - 1 - a and x = 1 + 1 - a . There are vertical

asymptotes at these values.

Is that the whole story? Well, no. We now have to decide whether the two significant points of our

graph, namely x = 0 where the curve crosses the axis and x = a where the curve has a maximum, lie
                                                              
inside or outside the forbidden zone 1 - 1 - a  x  1 + 1 - a . This turns out to depend on whether

a < 0 or a = 0 or 0 < a < 1. The graph will look qualitatively different in each case, so there is still quite

a lot of work to do in this a < 1 case! We can see why it was excluded from the original question.

Comments

The  very  first  part  can  be  done  by  multiplying   both  sides  of  ()  by  sin  1    and  using  the  identity
                                                                                       2

                                       2 sin A sin B = cos(B - A) - cos(B + A) .

It can also be done by induction (worth a try even if you do it by the above method) or by considering
                              

the imaginary part of exp(ik) (summing this as a geometric progression), if you know about de
Moivre's theorem.

Before setting pen to paper for part (ii), it pays to think very hard about simplifications of the right-hand
side of () that might make the differentiation more tractable - perhaps bearing in mind the calculations
required for part (i).

In the original question, you were asked to show that, for large n,
                                                       n ( k ) 2n
                                                            sin n  

                                                                               k=0

and                                        n           ()(                    )

using the approximations, valid for small , sin    and cos   1 - 12 2 . Of course, these results
follow quickly from the exact results; but if you only want approximate results you can save yourself a

bit of work by approximating early to avoid doing some of the trigonometric calculations. I thought that

the exact results were nicer than the approximate results so I changed the question a bit for this book

(though I felt a bit guilty, because approximations are an important part of mathematics).

Before attempting to differentiate the right hand side of () it is a good idea to write it in a form that gets
rid of some of the fractions. Omitting for the moment the factor 1/2, we have

                             RHS of ()           =  (1  -   cos   n)  cot   1     +  sin  n

and differentiating gives - 12 (1 - cos n) cosec2 12  + n sin n cot 12  + n cos n . Now setting  = /n gives

                                               - cosec2 12 (/n) - n .                                                            ()

Setting  = /n in equation () and comparing with () (remembering that there is a factor of 1/2
missing) gives the required result.

Post-mortem

Now that I have had another go at this question it does not seem terribly interesting. At first, I thought
I might ditch it. Then I thought that it perhaps was worthwhile: keeping cool under the pressure of the
differentiation for part (ii) - it should just be a few careful lines - and getting it out is a good confidence
booster. Anyway, now that I have slogged24 through it, I am going to leave it in.
[Next day] I recall now that the reason that I included this question in the first place was because in its
original form (with approximate answers as given in the comments section above), the result for part
(ii) can be obtained very quickly from part (i) by differentiating both sides with respect to  and using a
double angle formula. Try it!
Unfortunately, you'd have a hard time justifying this approach, and anyway it is not going to work for
the exact result.25

24 I should come clean at this point: I just differentiated () on autopilot, without considering whether I could simplify the task
   by rewriting the formula as suggested in my hint on the previous page. It was hard work. Serves me right for not following my
   own general advice.

25 For large n we are just adding up a lot of sin curves and it doesn't much matter what the exact value of  is (so we can take it to
   be a variable); for the exact result, the exact value of  does matter.

Comments

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that a polynomial of degree n can be written as the product
of n linear factors, so we can write

          x3 - px2 + qx - r = (x - )(x - )(x - ) ,    ()

where  ,  and  are the roots of the equation x3 - px2 + qx - r = 0 . The basis of this question is the
comparison between the left hand side of () and the right hand side, multiplied out, of (). Some of the
roots may not be real, but you don't have to worry about that here.

The `necessary and sufficient' in part (iii) looks a bit forbidding, but if you just repeat the steps of parts
(i) and (ii), it is straightforward.
88 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 35

(i) We have

             (x - ak-1)(x - a)(x - ak)  x3 - px2 + qx - r

i.e.
                       x3 - a(k-1 + 1 + k)x2 + a2(k-1 + 1 + k)x - a3 = x3 - px2 + qx - r .

Thus p = a(k-1 + 1 + k) , q = a2(k-1 + 1 + k) , and r = a3 . Dividing gives q/p = a , which is a root, and
q3/p3 = a3 = r as required.
(ii) Set r = q3/p3 . Substituting x = q/p into the cubic shows that it is a root:

             (q/p)3 - p(q/p)2 + q(q/p) - (q/p)3 = 0 .

Since q/p is one root, and the product of the three roots is q3/p3 (= r in the original equation), the product
of the other two roots must be q2/p2. The two roots can therefore be written in the form k-1(q/p) and
k(q/p) for some number k , which shows that the three roots are in geometric progression.

(iii) The three roots are in arithmetic progression if and only if they are of the form (a - d) , a and (a + d) .
(I have followed the lead of part (i) in using this form rather than a, a + d, a + 2d.)

If the roots are in this form, then
                                (x - (a - d))(x - a)(x - (a + d))  x3 - px2 + qx - r

i.e.
                             x3 - 3ax2 + (3a2 - d2)x - a(a2 - d2)  x3 - px2 + qx - r .

Thus p = 3a , q = 3a2 - d2 , r = a(a2 - d2) . A necessary condition is therefore r = (p/3)(q - 2p2/9). Note
that one root is p/3.
Conversely, if r = (p/3)(q - 2p2/9) , the equation is

                                           x3 - px2 + qx - (p/3)(q - 2p2/9) = 0 .

We can verify that p/3 is a root by substitution. Since the roots sum to p and one of them is p/3, the
others must be of the form p/3 - d and p/3 + d for some d. They are therefore in arithmetic progression.

A necessary and sufficient condition for the roots to be in arithmetic progression is therefore r =
(p/3)(q - 2p2/9).

Post-mortem

As usual, it is a good idea to give a bit of thought to the conditions given, namely p = 0 and r = 0 .
Clearly, if the roots are in geometric progression, we cannot have a zero root. We therefore need r = 0 .
However, we don't need the condition p = 0 . If the roots are in geometric progression with p = 0, then
q = 0 , but there is no contradiction: the roots are be-2i/3 , b and be2i/3 where b3 = r , and these are
certainly in geometric progression. So the necessary and sufficient conditions are r = 0 and p3r = q3 .
Neither of these conditions is required if the roots are in arithmetic progression.
Therefore, the condition p = 0 is only there as a convenience -- one thing less for you to worry about.
The condition r = 0 should really have been given only for the first part. It should be said that this sort
of question is incredibly difficult to word, which is why the examiner was a bit heavy handed with the
conditions.

Comments

In good STEP style, this question has two related parts. In this case, the first part not only gives you
guidance for the second part, but also provides a result that is useful for the second part.

In part (ii) of the original question you were asked to determine the number of real roots in the cases
0 < k  2/ and 2/ < k < 1 . I thought that you would like to work out all the different cases
for yourself -- but it makes the question considerably harder, especially if you think about the special
values of k as well as the ranges of k .
For part (i) you need to know that xex  0 as x  - . This is just a special case of the result that
exponentials go to zero faster than any power of x .

For part (ii), it is not really necessary to do all the sketches, but I think you should (though you perhaps
wouldn't under examination conditions) because it gives you a complete understanding of the way the
function depends on the parameter k . For the graphs, you may want to consider the sign of f (0) ; this
will give you an important clue. Remember that, by definition, - 12  < tan-1 x < 12  .

Solution to problem 36

(i) Differentiating gives f (x) = 2xex + (1 + x2)ex = (1 + x)2ex which is non-negative because the square
is non-negative and the exponential is positive.

There is one stationary point, at x = -1 , which is a point of inflection, since the gradient on either side
is positive.

Also, f (x)  -k as x  - , f (0) = 1 - k and f (x)   as x  + . The graph is essentially
exponential, with a hiccup at x = -1 . The differences between the three cases are the positions of the
horizontal asymptote (x  -) and the place where the graph cuts the y axis (above or below the x
axis?).

Since the graph is increasing and 0 < f (x) < , the given equation has one real root if k > 0 and no real

roots if k  0. When k = 0 we have f (x) = (1 + x2)ex which is always positive.                           y
                    y                                           y

k<0                                  0<k<1                                                   k>1

                              x                                                   x                                       x

(ii) First we collect up information required to sketch the graph, as in part (i). We have

f (0) = 0, f (x)  12 k - 1 as x  - , f (x)   as x   , f (x) = ex - k(1 + x2)-1 (which we
know from the first part can only be zero only if k > 0 ), f (0) = 1 - k .

The important values of k seem to be 0 , 2/ and 1 so we will have to consider seven cases. Note that

when k = 0 the equation becomes ex = 1, which has one root at x = 0.
                    y                                           y                                        y

                    y                                    y                                                       y
2/ < k < 1                           k=1                                                     k>1

                              x                                                   x                                       x

As  you  see,  the  equation  (ex - 1) - k tan-1  x  =  0  has  one  root  if  k     2  and  two  roots  otherwise.  The  case
                                                                                     

k = 1 can be thought of as having one root at x = 0 or as having two roots, both at x = 0 (it is a double

root).

Post-mortem

I think I made a bit of a meal of this; I got carried away with the sketches. But it was reassuring (compul-
sive, I found) to consider every case. My explanation is pretty compact, so I think you'll have to work it
through on your own to convince yourself of the details.

Comments

Each part of this looks horrendously difficult, but it doesn't take much thought to see what is going
on. If you haven't come across the concept of the integer part some examples should make it clear:
[21.25] = 21 , [] = 3 , [1.999999] = 1 and [2] = 2 .

                                                                                            
For part (iii), you need to know the series for the number e, which is 1/n! .

                                                                                                                                   n=0

If you are stumped by the last part, just remember the definition of the word irrational: x is rational
if and only if it can be expressed in the form p/q where p and q are integers; if x is not rational, it is
irrational. Then look for a proof by contradiction (`Suppose that x is rational ...').
The first proof that e is irrational was given by Euler in 1736. He also named the number e, though he
didn't `invent' it; e is the basis for natural logarithms and as such was used implicitly by John Napier in
1614. Euler's proof involved the use of continuous fractions. He wrote e as:

                                                                       1

                                                             1+

                                                                            1

the numbers in the denominators forming the infinite pattern 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8 . . .. It is known
that any such continuous fraction represents an irrational number.
In general, it is not easy to show that numbers are irrational. Johann Lambert showed that  is irrational
in 1760, but the simple continued fraction for  is not known. It is still not known if  + e is irrational.
The proof that e is irrational given in this question is based on a proof by Fourier26 from about 1815.

26 Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) was a French mathematician and administrator. He is best known for his work on the theory of heat
   flow. He is generally credited with the discovery of the greenhouse effect. He spent some time in Egypt with Napoleon, and
   contributed much to the modern study of Egyptology.

Solution to problem 37

(i) Although the series for bn does not at first sight look tractable, it is in fact just a geometric progression:

the first term is 1/(n + 1) and the common ratio is also 1/(n + 1) . Thus

                                              bn = 1           (  )
                                                                  1 =1.
                                              n + 1 1 - 1/(n + 1) n

(ii) Each term (after the first) of an is less than the corresponding term in bn, so an < bn = 1/n .

(iii) Multiplying the series for e by n! gives

                                              n!e = n! + n! + 12 n! +    + 1 + an

and the result follows because an < 1 and all the other terms on the right hand side of the above
equation are integers.

(iv) We use proof by contradiction. Suppose that there exist integers k and m such that e = k/m. Then
m!e is certainly an integer. But if m!e is an integer then [m!e] = m!e, which contradicts the result of part
(iii) since we know that am = 0 (it is obvious from the definition that am > 0).

Post-mortem

Well, that was short!
There were, however, two key steps which were not difficult in themselves but were not easy to find in
the context of this question.
The first was to recognise that bn is, for each n, a simple geometric progression. If it had been presented
in the form b = r + r2 + r3 +    it would have been immediately recognisable. Somehow, the fact that
the ratio r is given in terms of n -- or, even worse, n + 1 -- makes it difficult to spot; not least because n
is fixed for each series instead of labelling the terms of an individual series.
The second key step, in part (iv), was to assume that e = k/m and show that m! e, not me, cannot be
an integer. It seems so wasteful when it would suffice to show that me is not an integer. We seem to be
making a great deal of extra work for ourselves and that profligacy, unusual in mathematics, might well
have thrown you off the scent despite the clear signal from part (iii).
I don't regard the idea of using proof by contradiction as a difficult step in part (iv). An irrational
number is by definition a number that is not rational, so the idea of a proof by contradiction should

                                                                                                          27
jump out at you. Indeed, the standard example, the proof of the irrationality of 2, is by contradiction.

27                  =  q.  Then  2p2  =  q2.  Writing p and q  as the product of primes  gives the contradiction since  there are an odd
    Suppose p 2

    number of powers of 2 one side of this equation and an even number on the other.

Comments

I had to add a bit to the original question because it was all dressed up with nowhere to go. The question
is clearly about estimating n! so I added in the last line, which makes the question a bit longer but not
much more difficult. I could have added another part, but I thought that you would probably add it
yourself: you will easily spot, once you have drawn the graphs, that a similar result for n! with the
inequality reversed can be obtained by considering rectangles the tops of which are above the graph of
ex instead of below it. You therefore end up with a nice sandwich inequality for n! .
Stirling (1692-1770) proved in 1730 that n!  2 nn+ 12 e-n for large n. This was a brilliant result --

                                                                     
even reading his book, it is hard to see where he got 2 from (especially as he wrote in Latin). Then he
went on to obtain the approximation in terms of an infinite series; the expression above is just the first
term.

        y

                                          is 1 unit and the width decreases as x increases because the
                                          gradient of ex increases. It starts at height 1 and ends at height

                                          (n - 1) .

                                          The value of [ex] changes from k - 1 to k when ex = k i.e.

                                          when x = ln k . Thus [ex] = k when ln k  x < ln(k + 1) and()

Post-mortem

Usually when you draw a graph of a discontinuous function, you should specify at the jump whether the
function takes the upper or lower value. For example [x] takes the value 1 at x = 1, which is the upper
value. This can be achieved by putting (say) a circle round the upper or lower point, as appropriate. I
didn't bother on the above graphs, because it doesn't affect the value of the integral and I didn't want
to clutter up the graphs.
Considering [ex + 1] instead of [ex] gives rectangles above the graph of y = ex rather than below. The
calculations are roughly the same, so you should easily arrive at n!  nn+1e1-n . We have therefore
proved that

                                                   nne1-n  n!  nn+1e1-n .

This gives a pretty good (given the rather elementary method at our disposal) approximation for n! for
large n .

This tests trigonometric manipulation and integration skills. You will certainly need tan 2 in terms of
tan  , and cos 2 in terms of cos , and maybe other formulae.

Both parts of the question are multistep: there are half a dozen consecutive steps, each different in
nature, with no guidance. This is unusual in school-level mathematics but normal in university mathe-
matics.

I checked the answer on Wolfram Alpha, which turned out to be very good indeed at doing this sort of

thing. I asked it to do the indefinite integral as well and, in less than a second, it came up with

          [        -1]

          1 - x -1 - ( x + 1 + 1) + [ x + 1 + 1] - 2 sin 2 (x + 1) .

                                                                                    

Not a pretty sight and not in its neatest form by a long way: for example, 2 sin-1    1  (x  +  1)   reduces,
                                                                                      2

after a bit of algebra, to 12  + sin-1 x . I also asked it to do the same integral with the 2 replaced by a

parameter k and it took four seconds. The answer was about 20 times longer than the k = 2 result but it

seemed to enjoy the problem, as far as I could tell.

Solution to problem 39

For  the  first  part,  to  save  writing,  let  t  =  tan     .  Then
                                                            8

                                  2t                2                     -2  8 
                            1 - t2 = 1  t + 2t - 1 = 0  t = 2 = -1  2 .

We take the root with the + sign since we know that t is positive.

Now the integral. Note first that the integrand has an obvious symmetry: it is unchanged when x  -x.
This means that we can do the integral over the half-range x = 0 to x = 1 and double the result. A glance
at the required result suggests that this is a good idea.

Substituting x = sin 4t as instructed then gives

                                             1                    4 cos 4t
                                                  8

                                      I =2                                           dt
                                                       1 + sin 4t + 1 - sin 4t + 2
                                                 0

so to obtain the given answer we need to show that
                                          1 + sin 4t + 1 - sin 4t + 2 = 4 cos2 t ,

i.e.  
                                               1 + sin 4t + 1 - sin 4t = 2 cos 2t .

If we square both sides of this equation, noting that both sides are positive for the values of t in the

integral so this is not dangerous, nice things happen:                                               (RTP)
                                                                        

                                  (1 + sin 4t) + (1 - sin 4t) + 2 1 - sin2 4t = 4 cos2 2t

i.e.                                                                                                 (RTP)
                                                      2 + 2 cos 4t = 4 cos2 2t

which is true by a standard trig. identity, so we have proved what we were required to prove.
For the last part, we have

                         cos 4t = 2 cos2 2t - 1 = 2(2 cos2 t - 1)2 - 1 = 8 cos4 t - 8 cos2 t + 1

so

            81  (                                       81  (                            [        ]1
                                                                                                  8
                 8 cos2 t - 8 + sec2 t) dt = 2                    4 cos 2t - 4 + sec2 t) dt = 2 2 sin 2t - 4t + tan t ,
     I =2

           0                                                0                                     0

which gives the required result.

Post-mortem

Manipulating the integrand after the change of variable was really quite demanding. You could easily
go down the wrong track and become mired in algebra. I did it by writing down what I was trying to
prove and then showing that it was indeed true. This of course is hazardous, because if you are not
careful you might assume the result in order to prove the result. I find it helps to write `RTP' (Required
To Prove) in the margin to indicate clearly to myself and others that I am not assuming it to be true.

The first thing we did with the integral, guided by the given answer, was to use the symmetry x  -x
to reduce the range of integration to 0  x  1, doubling the result. It is clear from a graph that this
works but you could, if you were unsure, split the integral into two parts (integral from -1 to 0 plus
integral from 0 to 1) then make the change of variable y = -x in the lower integral to show that the two
parts are equal.

Comments

You should think about part (i) graphically, though it is not necessary to draw the graph: just set about
it as if you were going to (starting point, finishing point, turning points, etc).
The equivalence sign in part (ii) indicates an equality that holds for all x -- you are not being asked to
solve the equation for x.
For part (iii), you need to know that inequalities can be integrated: this is `obvious' if you think about
integration in terms of area, though a formal proof requires a formal definition of integration and this is
the sort of thing you would do in your first university course in mathematical analysis.

which  is  positive  for  0  <  x2  <  3.  Therefore,  f  (x)  increases  in  value  from  0  at  x  =  0  to  1   at  x  =  1.

and multiplying by (x2 + 1)4 gives the following identity:

                          1  (5Ax4 + 3Bx2 + C)(x2 + 1) - 6x(Ax5 + Bx3 + Cx) + Dx6                                                ()

i.e.

Equating coefficients of the different powers of x on each side of the equivalence sign gives 1 = C,
0 = 3B - 5C, 0 = 5A - 3B, 0 = D - A, so A = 1, B = 53 , C = 1 and D = 1.

from which the required result follows immediately.

Post-mortem

Instead of equating coefficients in (), you could obtain equations for A , B , C and D by putting four
carefully chosen values of x into the equation. An obvious choice is x = 0, but (thinking flexibly!) you
could try x = i to eliminate terms with factors of x2 + 1 . After this, it becomes more difficult to find
good choices.

You might wonder why, in part (ii), the term inside the derivative has only odd powers of x. Would it
not make it more general to include even powers as well? You could in fact include even powers but
you would find that their coefficients would be zero: all the other terms in the equation are even in x,
so the derivative has to be an even function which means that the function being differentiated must be
odd.

Although the idea of this question is good, the final result is a bit feeble. It only gives the value of the

integral to an accuracy of about 161 / 24 11 which is about 15%. The actual value of the integral can be found

fairly easily using the substitution x       =  tan t and is      11   +  645   so the inequalities can be used to give
                                                                  48

splitting up the range of integration at the points where the integrand changes sign. In parts (i) and (ii)
you have to use the technique on different examples.
100 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 41

For the first part, note that |xex| = -xex if x < 0 . Then integrate by parts to evaluate the integrals:

0                  1                  ([ ]0  0             ) ([ ]1  1             )

    (-xex)dx + xexdx = - xex - exdx + xex - exdx = 2 - 2e-1 .

For the next parts, we have to find out where the integrand is positive and where it is negative.

(i) x3 - 2x2 - x + 2 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2) (spotting the factors), so the integrand is positive for 0  x < 1 ,
negative for 1 < x < 2 and positive for 2 < x < 4 (a quick sketch will help with this). Splitting the range

of integration into these ranges and integrating gives

      x3 - 2x2 - x + 2 dx                                                                                 ()

(ii) sin x + cos x changes sign when tan x = -1, i.e. when x = - 14  and x = 34 . Splitting the range of

Alternatively, start by writing sin x + cos x = 2 cos(x - 41 ) which makes the changes of sign easier to
spot and the integrals easier to do.

Post-mortem

If you give a bit more thought to part (ii), you will see easier ways of doing it. Since the trigonometric
functions are periodic with period 2 the integrand is also periodic. Write the integrand in the form
1

  2 cos(x - 4 ) . Integrating this over any 2 interval gives the same result. Indeed, we may as well
            

integrate 2 sin x from 0 to 2; or from 0 to  and double the answer.

After the first edition of this book appeared, a correspondent e-mailed to suggest that we should inte-

grate () by writing it in the form

                      4                                 2

                         (x3 - 2x2 - x + 2) dx - 2 (x3 - 2x2 - x + 2) dx.

                      0                                 1

Yes, that's quite a good idea; it would have saved a bit of writing and reduced the risk of arithmetical
errors.

Comments

I thought it would be good to include at least one plane geometry question in this collection, so here
it is. As always with geometry, the first thing to do is draw a BIG diagram. You will probably need to
have quite a few tries at it.
Then you have the usual tools at your disposal: similar triangles, congruent triangles, angle-chasing,
and -- moving away from classical Euclidean geometry -- Pythagoras, and sine and cosine rules. I
leave it to you to decide what will be useful here.

Here is a careful diagram, with a construction arc left in to show that CB = CF = x. It took me ages.
But it is pretty much plain sailing now.
By the sine rule in ABC (and calculating an expression for sin 3 using double angle formulae)

AB = x sin(180 - 3) = x sin(3) = x(3 cos2  sin  - sin3 ) = (3 - 4 sin2 )x
              sin      sin                                              sin 

as required.

Then, since D is the mid-point of AB and BEC = 90,

              DE = 12 AB - BE = 12 x(3 - 4 sin2 ) - x cos 2 = 12 x,

rather surprisingly.

For the last part, since BCA = 180 - 3, we need to show that F CA = 60 -  or, equivalently,
F CB = 120 - 2. Now BCE = 90 - 2 so we are done if we can show that ECF = 30. But that
follows almost immediately from the DE = 12 x and F C = x: draw the perpendicular from F to CE,
which has length 12 x, and consider the right-angled triangle thus formed.

Post-mortem

I liked the mixture here of angle-chasing and use of the sine rule. Geometry purists, though, would be
appalled; using the sine rule in a geometry problem is like using metal screws instead of wooden dowels
on an antique wooden cabinet. As it happens, there is a beautiful proof of this result by pure geometry.
You have to reflect the whole diagram about the perpendicular bisector of AB. For the details, see Ross
Honsberger's excellent Mathematical Chestnuts from around the World (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 2001), section 20.

Comments

The first of the two substitutions is familiarly known as the `t substitution'. It would have been very
standard fare 30 years ago, but it seems to have gone out of fashion now. The second of the two substi-
tutions is the normal substitution for integrals with quadratic denominators.

For the last part, `deduce' implies that you don't have to do any further integration. Note that the
variable in the integral is  instead of . Since it is a definite integral, it doesn't matter what the variable
is called; it could equally well have been called  as in the original integral I . The use of a different
variable was just a kindness on the part of the examiner to indicate that you should be thinking about a
change of variable.

The `similar result' that you deduce should include the conditions under which it is true. It is worth
thinking about why the condition 0 <  < 12  is required -- or, indeed, if it is required.
104 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 43

The three identities just require use of cos  = cos2 12  - sin2 12  and sin  = 2 sin 12  cos 12  . If you divide

each by cos2 12  + sin2 12  (i.e. by 1) the first two identities drop out. Remember, for the last one, that

cot  x  =  tan(   1    -  x).
                  2

For  the   first  change  of     variable,  we  have  dt  =  1  sec2  12  d  =  12 (1  +  t2)d  and  the  new    limits  are  0  and    1,
                                                             2

so

                      21  1                           1 1 2
           I=             1 + cos  sin  d =           0 1 + cos  1+t2 2t 1 + t2 dt

                     0

                                                      1 2                                 1 2
                                                0 = 1 + 2t cos  + t2 0 dt = (t + cos )2 + sin2  dt .

For the second change of variable,          we have dt       =  sin  sec2  u du .  When t    =  0,  tan u  =  cot      so u  =  1    -    .
                                                                                                                                2

When t = 1 , sin  tan u = 1 + cos  so (after a bit of work with double-angle formulae) u = 12  - 12  .

Thus                       2 2 1 - 1  2                                2 2 2 1 - 1  2 

                     I=              sin2 (1 + tan2 u) 12 - sin  sec udu =                      sin  du = sin  .

                          1      -
                          2

For the last part, we want to make a substitution that changes the cosine in the denominator to a sine.

One possibility is to set  = 12  -  . This will swap the limits but also introduces a minus sign since

d = -d . Thus

                                  0 1                                 d =     2 1                      d .
                                     =I =-
                               sin               1 + cos  cos                   0 1 + cos  cos 

                                                2

This is almost the integral we want: we still need to replace cos  in the denominator by sin  . Remem-

bering what we did a couple of lines back, we just replace  by 12  -  in the integral and in the answer,

giving                                           2 1

                                                                      d =       12  -     .

                                                0 1 + cos  cos                  cos 

If the original  satisfied 0 <  < 12 , the new  must satisfy 12  >  > 0, which is the same.

Post-mortem

One reason for the restriction on  might be to prevent the denominator of the integrand being zero for

some value of  ; a zero in the denominator usually means that the integral is undefined. However, the

only value of  for which cos  sin               could possibly be as small as -1 (for 0                    1  )  is    (and of course
                                                                                                           2

3, etc). From this point of view, we only need  =  (etc). There is a slight awkwardness in the answer

when  = 0 but this can be overcome by taking limits:

                                                          lim         =1

                                                          0 sin 

which you can easily verify is the correct value of the integral when  = 0.

You might therefore think that the restriction 0 <  < 12  is superfluous. But here is a curious thing:
increasing  by 2 does not change I but does change the answer! If you work through the solution with
this in mind you see that it can make a difference only when you work out tan-1 u , which by definition
lies in the range - 12  to 12  , and this is why we must have - 12  <   12 . We lose nothing by using
instead 0    12 , since   - doesn't change the integral. The strict inequalities (< rather than )
avoid trouble with the denominators when  = 0 in the first integral or  = 12  in the second.

Problem 44: A differential-difference equation                ()

A damped system with feedback is modelled by the equation

                               f (t) = -f (t) + kf (t - 1) ,  (1)

where k is a given non-zero constant.

possible provided m satisfies

                                       m + 1 = ke-m.          (2)

Show also, by means of a sketch or otherwise, that equation (2) can have 0, 1 or 2 real roots,
depending on the value of k, and find the set of values of k for which such solutions exist. For
what set of values of k do the corresponding solutions of (1) tend to zero as t  ?

                                                              1990 Paper II

Comments

Do not be put off by the words at the very beginning of the question, which you do not need to under-
stand. In any case, the question very soon morphs into an investigation of roots of an equation using
curve sketching. However, their meaning can be gleaned from the equation itself (sometimes called a
differential-difference equation). The left hand side of the equation is the rate of increase of the function f ,
which may measure the amplitude of some physical disturbance. According to the equation, this is
equal to the sum of two terms. One is -f (t), which represents damping: this term alone would give
exponentially decreasing solutions. The other is a positive term proportional to f (t - 1): this is called a
feedback term, because it depends on the value of f one year (say) previously. The feedback term could
represent some seasonal effect, while the damping term may be caused by some resistance-to-growth
factor.

The suggested method of solving the equation is similar to what you might have used for second or-
der linear equations with constant coefficients: you guess a solution (emt) and then substitute into the
equation to check that this is a possible form of solution and to find the values of m which will work.
It is always possible to multiply the exponential by a constant factor, since any constant multiple of a
solution is also a solution. (This is a consequence of the linearity of the equation: i.e. no terms involving
f (t)2, f (t)3, etc.) We can also take linear combinations of solutions to produce a more general solution.

To find the set of values of k which give real solutions of (2), you need to investigate the borderline
case, where the two curves y = m + 1 and y = ke-m just touch (and therefore have the same gradient).
Remember that the sign of k is not restricted.

Unlike the second order differential equation case, the equation for m is not quadratic; in fact, it is not
even polynomial, since it has an exponential term. This means, as we will find, that there may not be
exactly 2 solutions; in general, there may be many solutions (e.g. the non-polynomial equation sin m = 0
has solutions m = 0, , 2, . . .) or no solutions (e.g. em = 0 has no solutions). And unlike the differential
equation case, we have no idea whether the method is going to work, because there may be solutions of
a completely different form. The full analysis of equations such as (1) provides an extraordinarily rich
field of study with many surprising results.

Solution to problem 44

We do as we are told to start and substitute Aemt into equation (1). After cancelling the overall factor A,

we get

                                      memt = -emt + kem(t-1) .

We can cancel the overall factor emt, but an exponential remains on account of the f (t - 1) term:

                                         m = -1 + ke-m,

which is equivalent to equation (2) overleaf.

                    yy

                       y = m+1                                                        1

                 2                                              y = m+1

                 1                                                      0                   m

                 0                             -3               -2  -1                   1
        -1
                       y = kem                 y = kem
               -1
                                                                        -1

The above sketches show y = m + 1 and y = ke-m on the same axes, for positive and negative k: in the
first sketch, k = 2; in the second k = -0.1.

As can be seen from the sketches, equation (2) always has exactly one solution if k > 0. For k < 0, there
may be two or zero solutions depending on whether the line and curve intersect, or just one solution if
they touch. They will touch if there is a value of m such that

                                               m + 1 = ke-m and 1 = -ke-m,

the second of these equations being the condition that the gradients (differentiate with respect to m to
find the gradient) of the line and curve are the same at the common point. Solving the two equations
gives m = -2 and k = -e-2.
If 0 > k > -e-2, then the curve and line will intersect, so the set of values of k for which equation (2)
has solutions is k > 0 and -e-2  k < 0.
The corresponding solutions to equation (1) tend to zero as t   if and only if m < 0, because then
they are exponentially decreasing rather than increasing.
If k < 0, we can see from the sketch that the solutions of (2), if there are any (i.e. if -e-2  k < 0), occur
in the bottom left quadrant, and so m < 0. The corresponding solutions of (1) will tend to zero.
If k > 0, the intersection of the graph of y = ke-m with the y-axis is at y = k whereas the intersection of
the graph of y = m + 1 with the y-axis is at y = 1. For k  1, the solution of (2) occurs in the top right
quadrant and has m  0. For 0 < k < 1, the solution occurs in the top left quadrant and has m < 0.
The range of k for which the solutions tend to zero as t   is therefore -e-2  k < 0 and 0 < k < 1.

This looks pretty frightening at first, because of the complicated and unfamiliar formula. However, its
bark is worse than its bite. Once you have decided what you need to find the inverse of, you just substi-
tute it into the formula and see what happens. Do not worry about the use of the word `convergence';
this can be ignored. It is just included to satisfy the legal eagles who will point out that the series might
not have a finite sum.

In part (ii) you can, as it happens, solve the cubic by normal means (find one root by inspection, factorise
and use the usual formula to solve the resulting quadratic equation). The root found by Lagrange's
equation is the one closest to zero. Equation () turns out to be a very obscure way of writing a familiar
quantity.28

Lagrange was one of the leading mathematicians of the 18th century; Napoleon referred to him as the
`lofty pyramid of the mathematical sciences'. He attacked a wide range of problems, from celestial
mechanics to number theory. In the course of his investigation of the roots of polynomial equations, he
discovered group theory (in particular, his eponymous theorem about the order of a subgroup dividing
the order of the group), though the term `group' and the systematic theory had to wait until Galois and
Abel in the first part of the 19th century.

Lagrange's formula, produced before the advent of the theory of integration in the complex plane, which
allows a relatively straightforward derivation, testifies to his remarkable mathematical ability. It is prac-
tically forgotten now, but in its day it had a great impact. The applications given above give an idea of
how important it was, in the age before computers.

28 The expansion sums to 1; I don't know how you can see that directly. I thought it would come from using the classical formula

for the root of a cubic:                 3 [ (     13  )] 31 3 [ (        13  )] 31

expanding each bracket binomially but it doesn't seem to. The roots are obtained from this complicated expression by noticing
[ that - 3 (  1  i 13 )] 13 = 1 (  1  i 13 ).

Solution to problem 45

(i) The inverse of f (x) = ax is given by f -1(y) = y/a. Substituting into f (y) = ay into Lagrange's
identity gives

               f -1(y) = y + 1 dn-1   [y - ay]n = y + (1 - a)n 1 dn-1yn
                                      n! dyn-1                                              n! dyn-1
                                   1                                    1

                                                                  = y + (1 - a)ny = y + y 1 - a ,
                                                                          1 1 - (1 - a)

where the last equality follows from summing the geometric progression. This simplifies to y/a, thus
verifying Lagrange's formula.

(ii) Let f (x) = x - 14 x3. Then the equation becomes f (x) = 34 , so we must find f -1( 43 ). Again, we just
substitute into Lagrange's formula, leaving y arbitrary for the moment:

               f -1(y) = y + 1 dn-1   [y - (y - 1 y3)]n = y + 1 dn-1 [ 1 y3]n
                                      n! dyn-1                      4                       n! dyn-1 4

                                   1                                                  1

                                                                                  1             dn-1 3n
                                                                        =y+                            y
                                                                                            4nn! dyn-1
                                                                                      1

                                                                        =y+             1       (3n)! y2n+1.

                                                                                      1 4 n! (2n + 1)!n

This  is  a  solution  to  the  equation29  x  -  14 x3  =  y,  so  we  just  set  y  =  3  to  obtain  the  given  result.
                                                                                         4

(iii) The obvious choice for f is f (x) = x - ex, in which case the equation becomes f (x) = 0 and we

want f -1(0). Again substituting into Lagrange's identity gives

               f -1(y) = y + 1 dn-1 [ey]n   = y + 1 dn-1   eny = y + 1 (n)n-1eny .
                                   n! dyn-1                            n! dyn-1                         n!
                                1                                   1                           1

Setting y = 0 gives a series for the root:

                                                  -1   n n-1 n-1
                                                  f (0) =                     ,
                                                                1 n!

which cannot be further simplified.

Post-mortem

Regarding convergence in Lagrange's formula:
Part (i): we need, somewhat mysteriously, 0 < a < 2 for the geometric progression to converge, but then
the result is valid for any y.
Part (ii): Using the approximation n!  (n/e)n, which is a simplified version of Stirling's formula, it

                                                                          
can be seen that the series converges provided |y| < 4/ 27. This is related to the condition for x to lie
between the two turning points of f (x), which guarantees that f -1(y) is well defined.
Part (iii): We can use Stirling's formula, as above, to show that series converges for || < e-1. You might
like to sketch the two functions x and ex; you should find that the range of values of  for which the
equation has a real root corresponds exactly to the range for which the series converges.

29 Note that this equation cannot in general be solved by spotting roots. In fact, by translation and scaling, any cubic equation can
   be reduced to this form, so our series solution can be used to find a solution of any cubic equation.

Comments

The Swiss family Bernoulli included no fewer than eight mathematicians who were counted amongst the
leading scholars of their day. They made major contributions to all branches of mathematics, especially
differential calculus. There was great rivalry between some members of the family; between brothers
Jakob (1654-1705) and Johann (1667-1748), in particular.

Johann once published an important result in the form of a Latin anagram, in order to retain the priority
of discovery without giving the game away to his brother. The anagram was: 24a, 6b, 6c, 8d, 33e, 5f , 2g,
4h, 33i, 6l, 21m, 26n, 16o, 8p, 5q, 17r, 16s, 25t, 32u, 4x, 3y, +, -, -, , =, 4, 2, 1, . The notation means
that his important result contained, for instance, the letter a 24 times either in text or in equations. After
waiting for a year for someone to solve it, Bernoulli weakened and published the solution himself. If
you are trying to solve the anagram yourself, you might like to know that it is about the Riccati equation
y = ay2 + bxn, which can be solved (very cunningly, as it turns out) when n is of the form -4m/(2m  1)
for any positive integer m. (Newton also published some work in the form of anagrams, during his
conflict with Leibniz.)

The polynomials described above were discovered by Jakob Bernoulli. They are defined recursively; that
is to say, the zeroth polynomial is given an explicit value, and the nth is determined from the (n - 1)th.
Here, Bn-1 has to be integrated to obtain Bn, which means that Bn is a polynomial of degree n. The
constant of integration is determined by the condition (2), so Bn is uniquely determined. We have to do
this explicitly for part (i).
110 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 46

(i) First we find B1(x) by integrating 1  B0(x), using equation (1): B1(x) = x + k, where k is a constant.
                         1
We find k by applying the condition 0 B1(x)dx = 0, which gives k = - 2 . Next we find B2(x) by similar1

means, giving x2 - x + 16 , and similarly B3(x) = x3 - 32 x2 + 12 x and B4(x) is as given.

(ii) We are asked to prove a result involving Bn(x) evaluated at x = 1 and x = 0, i.e. at the limits of the

integral (2). We therefore try the effect of integrating both sides of equation (1) between these limits:

                                       1 dBn(x)  1
                     Bn(1) - Bn(0)                         dx 0 dx = n Bn-1(x) dx = 0 ,

                                                        0

using property (2) with n replaced by (n - 1).
(iii) First the easy bit of the induction proof. For n = 1, we have B1(x) = x - 12 , so

                     B1(x + 1) - B1(x) = (x + 1 - 12 ) - (x - 12 ) = 1  nxn-1,

so the formula holds.
Now suppose that it holds for n = k:

                         Bk(x + 1) - Bk(x) - kxk-1 = 0                                                     (4)

and investigate

                         Bk+1(x + 1) - Bk+1(x) - (k + 1)xk ,                                               (5)

which we hope will also equal zero.
The only helpful thing we know about Bernoulli polynomials involves the derivatives. Therefore, let us
see what happens when we differentiate the expression (5):

                     d Bk+1(x + 1) - d Bk+1(x) - (k + 1)kxk-1 .
                     dx                                    dx

Now using (1) gives

                     (k + 1)Bk(x + 1) - (k + 1)Bk(x) - (k + 1)kxk-1.

Note that we have used the chain rule to differentiate Bk+1(x + 1) with respect to x rather than with
respect to (x + 1). Note also that there is a pleasing overall factor of (k + 1), which suggests that we are
on the right track. In fact, taking out this factor gives exactly the left hand side of equation (4), which is
zero.

Of course, we are not finished yet: we have only shown that the derivative of equation (5) is equal to
zero; the expression (5) is therefore constant:

                     Bk+1(x + 1) - Bk+1(x) - (k + 1)xk = A .

We must show that A = 0. Setting x = 0 gives Bk+1(1) - Bk+1(0) = A, which implies that A = 0 by
part (ii).

(iv) Summing (3) from x = 0 to x = k gives the first of these results immediately because nearly all the
terms cancel in pairs. The evaluation of the sum follows by calculating B4(1001) - B4(0) from the result
given in part (i).

Comments

It is not easy to set vector questions at this level: they tend to become merely complicated and tedious,
rather than difficult in an interesting way. In a good question, there is usually some underlying geometry
and it pays to try to understand what this is. Here, the question is about the geometrical object traced
out by  as  varies.
You will need to know about scalar products of vectors for this question, but otherwise it is really just
coordinate geometry.
Vectors form an extremely important part of almost every branch of mathematics (maybe every branch
of mathematics) and will probably be one of the first topics you tackle on your university course.

Solution to problem 47

Both  and the line r = (a i + b j + c k) pass through the origin, so the angle  between the lines is given

by the scalar product of the unit vectors, i.e. the scalar product between the given vectors divided by

the product of the lengths of the two vectors:

                                                                                           
                                      a(cos  + 3) + b( 2 sin ) + c(cos  - 3)
                     cos  = 
                                                                               
                                 (cos  + 3)2 + 2 sin2  + (cos  - 3)2 a2 + b2 + c2

                                                                           
                               (a + c) cos  + 2 b sin  + (a - c) 3
                            =                                                  .                                                 ()
                                         2 2 a2 + b2 + c2

Now we want to show that there is some choice of a , b and c such that cos  does not depend on the

value of  . By inspection of equation (), we see that this requires a = -c and b = 0 .
Setting a = -c in () gives cos  = 21 3 and  = 61  as required. We can absorb the constant a into , so

the equation of the line m becomes

                                                      r = (i - k) .                                                  ()

The coordinates of a general point on the line  are

                                                                                              
                     x = (cos  + 3) , y =  2 sin  , z = (cos  - 3) .

                                                               
For a point which is also on the plane x - z = 4 3 we have

                                                                                    
                                      (cos  + 3) - (cos  - 3) = 4 3

so  = 2 . The point P at the intersection between the line and the plane therefore has coordinates

                                                                                                                      (  )

As  varies, does P moves round a circle? That is not easy to see, but fortunately we gather from the

question that the centre of the circle is on m. It must also lie in the plane of the circle, which is the
                                                                                                      
plane x - z = 4 3. The line () meets this plane at the point (2 3, 0 , -2 3) ; call it O. To verify

that P describes a circle with centre O we must check that the distance from P , given by (  ), to O is

independent of . We have

                               OP  2  =  (2  cos  )2  +        sin  )2  +  (2  cos  )2  =  8    ,

which is indeed independent of . The radius of the circle is therefore 2 2.

As mentioned in the comments section, it is helpful to understand the geometry of vector questions.

 as  varies is the surface of a cone (actually a pair of cones).

The intersection of a plane with a cone is in general a conic section: an ellipse (of which a circle is a
special case), hyperbola, parabola or pair of straight lines. Try to picture these possibilities. In this case,
the normal to the plane, which is in direction (1, 0, -1), is parallel to the axis of the cone (the line m), so
the intersection is indeed a circle.

Comments

The long-sought solution of the general cubic was found, in 1535, by Niccol Tartaglia (c. 1500-1557).
He was persuaded to divulge his secret (in the form of a poem) by Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576), who
promised not to publish it before Tartaglia did. However, Cardano discovered that it had previously
been discovered by del Ferro (1465-1525/6) before 1515 so he published it himself in his algebra book
The Great Art. There followed an acrimonious dispute between Tartaglia and Cardano, in which the
latter was championed by his student Ferrari (1522-1565). The dispute culminated in a public mathe-
matical duel between Ferrari and Tartaglia held in the church of Santa Maria in Milan in 1548, in which
they attempted to solve each others' cubics. The duel ended in a shouting match with Tartaglia storming
off. It seems Ferrari was the winner. Tartaglia was sacked from his job as lecturer and Ferrari made his
fortune as a tax assessor before becoming a professor of mathematics at Bologna. He was poisoned by
his sister, with arsenic, in 1565.

Ferrari found a way of reducing quartic equations to cubic equations; his method (roughly) is used in
this question to solve a quartic which could probably be solved easier `otherwise'. But it is the method
that is interesting, not the solution.

The first step of the Ferrari method is to reduce the general quartic to a quartic equation with the cubic
term missing by means of a linear transformation of the form x  x - a . Then this reduced quartic
is factorised (the first displayed equation in this question). The factorisation can be found by solving a
cubic equation (the second displayed equation above) that must be satisfied by one of the coefficients in
the factorised form.

The solutions of the quartic are all complex, but don't worry if you haven't come across complex num-
bers: you will be able to do everything except perhaps write down the last line.

You will no doubt be full of admiration for this clever method of solving quartic equations. One thing
you are bound to ask yourself is how the other two roots of the cubic equation fit into the picture. In
fact, the cubic equation gives (in general) 6 distinct values of a so there is quite a lot of explaining to do,
given that the quartic has at most 4 distinct roots.
114 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 48

We have

         (x2 - ax + b)(x2 + ax + c) = (x2 - ax)(x2 + ax) + b(x2 + ax) + c(x2 - ax) + bc
                                            = x4 + (b + c - a2)x2 + a(b - c)x + bc

so

                          p = b + c - a2, q = a(b - c) , r = bc .                        ()

To obtain an equation for a in terms of p , q and r we eliminate b and c from () using the identity
(b + c)2 = (b - c)2 + 4bc . This gives (p + a2)2 = (q/a)2 + 4r which simplifies easily to the given cubic
with u replaced by a2 .

We can easily verify by direct substitution that u = 9 satisfies the given cubic.

To solve the quartic equation, the first task is to reduce it to the form x4 + px2 + qx + r = 0 , which has
no term in x3 . This is done by means of a translation. Noting that (y - a)4 = y4 - 4ay3 +    , we set
x = y - 2 . This gives

         (x + 2)4 - 8(x + 2)3 + 23(x + 2)2 - 34(x + 2) + 39 = 0 .

which (not surprisingly) boils down to x4 - x2 - 6x + 15 = 0 , so that p = -1, q = -6 and r = 15 .

We have already shown that one root of the cubic corresponding to these values is u = 9 . Thus we can

achieve the factorisation of the quartic into two quadratic factors by setting a = 3 (or a = -3; it doesn't

matter which we use) and

                                      b = 1 (p + a2 + q ) = 3
                                         2    a

                                      c = 1 (p + a2 - q ) = 5 .
                                         2    a

Thus

                          x4 - x2 - 6x + 15 = (x2 - 3x + 3)(x2 + 3x + 5) .

Setting each of the two quadratic factors equal to zero gives

                                                                  
                          x = 3  i 3 and x = -3  i 11 ,
                                      2                        2

so                                                             
                          y = 7  i 3 or y = 1  i 11 .

Post-mortem

Did you work out the relation between the six possible values of a (corresponding to given values of
p , q and r) and the roots of the quartic? The point is that the quartic can be written as the product of
four linear factors (by the fundamental theorem of algebra) and there are six ways of grouping the linear
factors into two quadratic factors. Each way corresponds to a value of a .

Comments

As is often the case, the required change of variable for part (i) can be worked out by inspection of the
limits.
To find the inverse function (note: inverse, not reciprocal) of the function f, it is often best to try to think

                                     ()
of the function g such that g f (x) = x, though making x the subject of y = f (x) is perhaps safer with
an unfamiliar function.
The condition f (x) > 0 ensures that f has a unique inverse; a function such as sin which has maximum
and minimum points has a unique inverse only on restricted ranges of its argument which do not contain
the turning points. (This is obvious from a sketch). The condition f (x) < 0 would do equally well.
The geometrical interpretations of these formulae are exceptionally pleasing, though the second one
needs some artistic skill to make it convincing.

Solution to problem 49

(i) The limits of the integral on the right hand side of equation (1) are f (a) and f (b), which suggests the
change of variable y = f (x). Making this change, so that dy = f (x)dx, gives

                                                       b( )                          b

                                      g(y) dy = g f (x) f (x) dx = x f (x) dx .

                                                       a                             a

                                                                                                            ()
For the last equality, we have used the definition of g as the inverse of f, i.e. g f (x) = x. This last

integral is begging to be integrated by parts:

                                         b                                 b b

                                               x f (x) dx = xf (x) - f (x) dx ,
                                                                           a
                                            a                                 a

which gives the required result after evaluating xf (x) at a and b. The first sketch below shows these ar-

eas: the area between the large and small rectangles is (b -a) , which is split into the areas represented

by the two integrals of equation (1), hatched vertically and horizontally, respectively.
                                                                                          1
                                                                                                            (            )
Setting f (x) = e2x and a = 0, b = 1 in the left hand side of (1) gives e2x dx = 12 e2 - 1 . For the right
                                                                                          0
                                                       e2                     e2                       e2x      1
hand  side  of  (1),  we  have    =   1  and     =         so  b     -  a  =      .  The  inverse  of       is  2  ln y  so  the  integral

becomes                e2 e2

                          1  ln y dy  =  1  (y  ln  y  -   y)        = 12 (2e2 - e2) - 12 (0 - 1) = 12 e2 + 12 .
                          2              2
                      1                                        1

Thus the left hand side of (1) agrees with the right hand side.

(ii) We can use the same method (change of variable followed by integration by parts):

        [g(y)]  2 b b  b  b dy = x2f (x) dx = x2f (x) - 2xf (x) dx = (b2 - a2) - 2 xf (x) dx ,

                             a                                    a     a                                          a

which gives the required formula (2) on multiplication by .

The first of the integrals in (2) is the volume of the solid body under the surface formed by rotating the
curve y = f (x) round the y-axis; this volume is thought of as a set of concentric cylindrical shells of
height f (x) with internal radius x (a  x  b ), and thickness dx. The second integral is the volume
inside the surface formed by rotating the curve y = f (x) round the y-axis; this volume is thought of as
a pile of infinitesimally thin discs of radius g(y) (  y   ) and thickness dy. The sum of the two
integrals is equal to the difference between the volumes of the two concentric cylinders (of radii a and b,
heights  and , respectively) as shown in the second sketch below.

              y                                                                                    y

Comments

No work is required to find the x coordinate of the stationary points, but you have to integrate the
differential equation to find the y coordinate. For the second part, you cannot integrate the equation --
other than numerically, or in terms of rather obscure special functions that you almost certainly haven't
come across, such as the incomplete gamma function defined by

                                                                 a

However, you can obtain an estimate, which is all that is required, by comparing the gradients of C1
with C2 and thinking of the graphs for -1  x  1 . This is perhaps a bit tricky; an idea that you may
well not alight on under examination conditions.

y = (1 - x2)xe-x2 dx = (1 - x2)(- 21 e-x2 ) - xe-x2 dx = - 21 (1 - x2)e-x2 + 21 e-x2 + const = 21 x2e-x2 ,

where we have used the fact that C1 passes through the origin to evaluate the constant of integration.

The  coordinates  of  the  stationary  points  are  therefore  (1,  1  e-1),  (0,  0)  and  (-1,  1  e-1).
                                                                    2                             2

One way of classifying the stationary points is to look at the second derivative:

       dy             3 -x2  d2y                    2 -x2              2      2 -x2                  2      4 -x2
           = (x - x )e = 2 = (1 - 3x )e - 2x (1 - x )e = (1 - 5x + 2x )e ,
       dx                    dx

which is positive when x = 0 (indicating a minimum) and negative when x = 1 and x = -1 (indicating
maxima).

Since y  0 as x  , the sketch is:

                                                      y

                                                           12 e-1

                                                                                                        x

                                       -1                                 1

For C2, the stationary points are again at x = 0 and x = 1. To classify the stationary points, we calculate

the second derivative:                 d2y = (1 - 3x2 - 3x3 + 3x5)e-x3 ,
                                       dx2

which is positive at x = 0 (a minimum) and negative at x = 1 (a maximum).

Since we cannot integrate this differential equation explicitly, we must compare C2 with C1 to see

whether the value of y at the maxima is indeed greater for C2 than for C1 .

For 0 < x < 1, x3 < x2, so ex3 < ex2 and e-x3 > e-x2 . Thus the gradient of C2 is greater than the
gradient of C1. Since both curves pass through the origin, we deduce that C2 lies above C1 for 0 < x  1
and therefore the maximum point (1, k) on C2 has k > 12 e-1 .

Post-mortem

You were probably surprised that the examiners didn't ask you to sketch C2; they usually do. It looks
as if it could be done, because you know that C2 passes through the origin and you can relate its slope,
roughly at least, to that of C1, which you did sketch. The difficulty lies in determining its behaviour as
x  ; does y  0 as for C1? In fact, it doesn't; no reason why it should. Instead, y  0.153... . We
shouldn't have expected C1 to asymptote to the x-axis either; the fact that it does so is due to a rather
delicate balancing of the two terms that determine its gradient.

Problem 51: Spherical loaf                                ()

Note: In this question slices of bread are eaten in order, starting at one end of the loaf.

A spherical loaf of bread is cut into parallel slices of equal thickness. Show that, after any
number of the slices have been eaten, the area of crust remaining is proportional to the number
of slices remaining.
A European ruling decrees that a parallel-sliced spherical loaf can only be referred to as `crusty'
if the ratio of volume V (in cubic metres) of bread remaining to area A (in square metres) of crust
remaining after any number of slices have been eaten satisfies V < A. Show that the radius of a
crusty parallel-sliced spherical loaf must be less than 2 23 metres.
[The area A and volume V formed by rotating a curve in the x-y plane round the x-axis from
x = a - t to x = a are given by

Comments

The first result (the mathematical result, I mean, not the European ruling which I invented) came as a
bit of a surprise to me -- though no doubt it is well known. I wondered if it was the only surface of
revolution with this property. You might like to think about this.
Don't be distracted by the use of the word `slices'; since the thickness of the slices is not given, it is clear
that you are supposed to think in terms of the continuous distance along the loaf rather than the number
of slices.
For the last part, you will need to minimise a ratio as a function of t (the `length' of loaf remaining). To
find the ratio you have to do a couple of integrals. It is this `multi-stepping' that makes the problem
difficult (and very different from typical school-level questions) rather than any individual step.
The note at the beginning of the question is new. Seventeen years after the question was set two people
wrote, independently, to say the solution was wrong and the question was wrongish. If you eat the
slices out of order you may eat the middle slice first which gives the weaker result r < 3 for the last part.
The first paragraph is still OK, because each slice has the same area of crust.
Volumes of revolution are no longer in the A level Mathematics specifications so have been moved from
the STEP 1 to the STEP 3 specification.

Solution to problem 51

The first thing we need is an equation for the surface of a spherical loaf. The obvious choice, especially
given the hint at the bottom of the question, is the circle x2 + y2 = a2 in the plane z = 0 , rotated about
the x-axis.

If the loaf is cut at a distance t from the end x = a, and the portion from x = -a to x = a - t is eaten,
then the area remaining is

                 a ( ( dy )2)12                    a ( 2 2 1 ( -x )2)12
                                                                                      2
                2 y 1 + dx a-t dx = 2 (a - x ) 1 + (a2 - x2) 21 dx
                a-t  a

                                             = 2 a dx

                                                  a-t

                                             = 2at .                                         ()

This is proportional to the length t of remaining loaf, so proportional to the number of slices remaining
(if the loaf is evenly sliced).

The remaining volume is

                            a                a             [     ]a

                                    y2dx =        (a2 - x2) dx =  (a2x - 13 x3)

                               a-t           a-t                                 a-t

                                        = (at2 - 13 t3).

As a quick check on the algebra, notice that this is zero when t = 0 and 43 a3 when t = 2a.

Thus V /A = (3at-t2)/(6a). This is a quadratic curve with zeros at t = 0 and t = 3a, so it has a maximum

at t = 32 a (by differentiating or otherwise), where V /A = 38 a. Since we require this ratio to be less than

one,  we  must  have  a  <  8  metres.

Post-mortem

It was well worth studying the information given at the end of the question before plunging into it: it
not only gave the necessary formulae for the surface area and volume, but also gave them in a form that
suggested a way forward right at the start of the question.

Did you think about whether there are other shapes that would have the property proved for the sphere
in the first paragraph of the question? Mathematically, it boils down to whether there are functions y(x),

                                     
other than our function y = a2 - x2, that can satisfy (). If we differentiate (), we obtain

                                             ( ( dy )2)12
                                        2y 1 + dx          = 2a

which looks formidable, but in fact simplifies to an equation that you can integrate quite easily. The
sphere is, it turns out, the only shape with the required property.

Problem 52: Snowploughing  ()

Two identical snowploughs plough the same stretch of road. The first starts at a time t1 seconds
after it starts snowing, and the second starts from the same point t2 - t1 seconds later, going in
the same direction. Snow falls so that the depth of snow increases at a constant rate of k ms-1.
The speed of each snowplough is ak/z ms-1 where z is the depth (in metres) of the snow it is
ploughing and a is a constant. Each snowplough clears all the snow. Show that the time t at
which the second snowplough has travelled a distance x metres satisfies the equation

                                                    a dt = t - t1ex/a. ()
                                                      dx

Hence show that the snowploughs will collide when they have travelled a(t2/t1 - 1) metres.

                                                                                                                1987 Specimen Paper III

Comments

There is something exceptionally beautiful about this question, but it is hard to identify exactly what it
is; seeing this question for the first time makes even hardened mathematicians smile with pleasure.

There is a modelling element to it: you have to set up equations from the information given in the text.
The first equation you need is a simple first order differential equation to find the time taken by the first
snowplough to travel a distance x. The corresponding equation for the second snowplough is a bit more
complicated, because the depth of snow at any point depends on the time at which the first snowplough
reached that point, clearing the snow.

The differential equation () can be solved using an integrating factor. However, the equation which
arises naturally at this point is one involving dx , which cannot (apparently) be solved by any means. It

                                                            dt
is the rather good trick of turning the equation upside down (regarding t as a function of x instead of x
as a function of t) that allows the problem to be solved so neatly. Apologies if you haven't come across
integrating factors for first order differential equations; but they are really not difficult--you can look
online and find an easily understandable explanation.

You won't surprised to learn that there is a generalisation to n identical snowploughs . . . .
122 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 52

Suppose that the first snowplough reaches a distance x at time T after it starts snowing. Then the depth

of snow it encounters is kT and its speed is therefore ak/(kT ), i.e. a/T . The equation of motion of the

first snowplough is

                                                dx = a .
                                                dT T

Integrating both sides with respect to T gives

                              x = a ln T + constant of integration.

We know that T = t1 when x = 0 (the snowplough started t1 seconds after the snow started), so

                                          x = a ln T - a ln t1.

This can be rewritten as

                                                T = t1ex/a .

When the second snowplough reaches x at time t, snow has been falling for a time t - T since it was
cleared by the first snowplough, so the depth at time t is k(t - T ) metres, i.e. k(t - t1ex/a) metres. Thus
the equation of motion of the second snowplough is

                                          dx       ak
                                          dt = k(t - t1ex/a) .

Now we use the standard result (a special case of the chain rule)
                                                             dx / dt
                                                             dt = 1 dx

to obtain the required equation ().
Multiplying by e-x/a (an integrating factor) and rearranging gives

                     e-x/a dt - e-x/at = - t1      i.e. d (te-x/a) = - t1
                          dx  a                 a             dx        a

which integrates to

                          te-x/a = - t1 x + constant of integration.
                                         a

Since the second snowplough started (x = 0) at time t2, the constant of integration is just t2 and the

solution is

                                          t = (t2 - t1x/a)ex/a.

The snowploughs collide when they reach the same position at the same time. Let this position be

x = X. Then

                              T = t = t1eX/a = (t2 - t1X/a)eX/a,

so X is given by

                                          t1 = (t2 - t1X/a).

This is equivalent to the given formula.

Problem 53: Tortoise and hare  ()

A tortoise and a hare have a race to the vegetable patch, a distance X kilometres from the starting
post, and back. The tortoise sets off immediately, at a steady v kilometres per hour. The hare
goes to sleep for half an hour and then sets off at a steady speed V kilometres per hour. The hare
overtakes the tortoise half a kilometre from the starting post, and continues on to the vegetable
patch, where she has another half an hour's sleep before setting off for the return journey at her
previous pace. One and quarter kilometres from the vegetable patch, she passes the tortoise, still
plodding gallantly and steadily towards the vegetable patch. Show that

                                                       V = 10

and find v in terms of X.
Find X if the hare arrives back at the starting post one and a half hours after the start of the race.
How long does it take the tortoise to reach the vegetable patch?

The  total  distance    travelled         by  the  hare     in  1   hour  is  2X ,  so

Post-mortem

It is interesting to see how quickly a mechanics question can change from mechanics to something else:
algebra, calculus or, as in this case, coordinate geometry. As soon as the picture is drawn, the equations
of the lines can be written down and everything follows as if it were a geometry problem.
Sometimes the change happens even more quickly. There is a well-known problem about a monk as-
cending a hill one day and descending the next day starting at the same time on each day. The problem
is to show that there is a time at which the monk was at the same height on both days. You are not
even given the speed at which the monk climbs. But if you draw (or just imagine drawing) height-time
graphs of the ascent and descent, and superimpose them, you are done.

Comments

I like this question because it relates to (an idealised version of) a situation we have probably all thought
about. Once you have visualised it, there are no great difficulties. As usual, you have to be careful with
the inequalities, though it turns out here that there is no danger of dividing by a negative quantity.
126 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 54

The easiest way to think about this problem is to consider the cars to be stationary and the velocity of
the chicken to be (u cos  - V, u sin ). Then the diagrams are very easy to visualise.

Let t be the time taken to cross the distance a in which the chicken is at risk. Then a = ut sin .
For safety, the chicken must choose ut cos  + c  V t: equality here occurs when the chicken starts at the
near-side rear of one car and just avoids being hit by the far-side front of the next car.

Eliminating t from these two equations gives the required inequality:

                                                                   ut cos   V t - c
                                                     = (u cos  - V )t  -c
                                             = (u cos  - V ) a  -c

                                                                    u sin 
                                                     = au cos  - aV  -cu sin 
                                               = u(c sin  + a cos )  aV

which is the required result.

For a given value of , the minimum speed satisfies

                                      u(c sin  + a cos ) = aV.

The smallest value of this u is therefore obtained when c sin  + a cos  is largest. This can be found by

calculus (regard it as a function of  and differentiate: the maximum occurs when tan  = c/a) or by

trigonometry:                c sin  + a cos  = a2 + c2 cos ( - tan-1(c/a))

                                  
so the maximum value is a2 + c2 and it occurs when tan  = c/a.

The time of crossing is

                         b  b(c sin  + a cos ) b(c + a cot ) b(c + a2/c)
                         u sin  = V a sin  = V a = V a .

Post-mortem

There is another inequality besides () that you might have noticed. If u cos  > V (so the chicken

moves faster than the cars -- a bit unlikely unless the chicken is trying to cross the M25), the chicken

should start her run at the front nearside of a car and must not collide with the car ahead. This requires

(u cos  - V )t  c, so

                                      u(-c sin  + a cos )  aV.

If (-c sin  + a cos ) < 0, this places no constraint on u. But if (-c sin  + a cos ) > 0, then

                                      u  aV .
                                            -c sin  + a cos 

In both cases, the inequality () overleaf does not apply. This is clearly not the situation envisaged by
the examiners, and probably not by any of the candidates either, but still it should have been catered for
in the wording of the question.

Problem 55: Hank's gold mine  ()

Hank's Gold Mine has a very long vertical shaft of height l. A light chain of length l passes over
a small smooth light fixed pulley at the top of the shaft. To one end of the chain is attached a
bucket A of negligible mass and to the other a bucket B of mass m.
The system is used to raise ore from the mine as follows. When bucket A is at the top it is filled
with mass 2m of water and bucket B is filled with mass m of ore, where 0 <  < 1. The buckets
are then released, so that bucket A descends and bucket B ascends. When bucket B reaches
the top both buckets are emptied and released, so that bucket B descends and bucket A ascends.
The time to fill and empty the buckets is negligible. Find the time taken from the moment bucket
A is released at the top until the first time it reaches the top again.
This process goes on for a very long time. Show that, if the greatest amount of ore is to be raised
in that time, then  must satisfy the condition f() = 0 where

                                                            (1 - )1/2
                                           f() = (1 - )1/2 + (3 + )1/2 .

                                                                                                                                1998 Paper I

Comments

One way of working out the acceleration of a system of two masses connected by a light string passing
over a pulley is to write down the equation of motion of each mass, bearing in mind that the force due
to tension will be the same for each mass (it cannot vary along the string, because then the acceleration
of some portion of the massless string would be infinite). Then you eliminate the tension.

Alternatively, you can use the equation of motion of the system of two joined masses. The system
has inertial mass equal to the sum of the masses (because both masses must accelerate equally) but
gravitational mass equal to the difference of the masses (because the gravitational force on one mass
cancels, partially, the gravitational force on the other), so the equation of motion is just (Newton's law
of motion)

                                                  (m1 + m2)a = (m1 - m2)g.
128 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 55

When bucket A ascends, the acceleration is g.

For bucket A's downward journey, at acceleration a, the equations of motion for bucket A and bucket
B, respectively, are

                                   -T + 2mg = 2ma, T - (1 + )mg = (1 + )ma,

where T is the tension in the rope. Eliminating T gives so a = 1 -  g.

                               12 
The time of descent (using l = 2 at ) is 2l/a and the time of ascent is 2l/g. The total time required

for one complete cycle is therefore   (            )

                                      2l 1 + 3 +  .
                                      g        1-

Call this t. The number of round trips in a long time tlong is tlong/t so the amount of ore lifted in time
tlong is mtlong/t.

To maximise this, we have to maximise /t with respect to , and /t is exactly the f () given. Note
that f (0) = 0 (which makes sense because no ore is raised if  = 0), and f (1) = 0 (which also makes
sense because the buckets don't move on the raising stage if  = 1). That means the greatest value of
f () must occur at a value of  in the range 0 <  < 1 at which f () = 0 .

Post-mortem

You may have wondered why, in the last part, the question says that the process goes on for a very
long time. The reason for this is that when you maximise what I have called mtlong/t the result may
not correspond to a complete number of cycles. If you stop in mid-cycle, you raise no ore from that
cycle so a calculus maximisation of a continuous function is not the right method. However, if the
process continues for many cycles, the contribution from the last cycle becomes negligible, and a calculus
maximisation becomes appropriate.

You may also wonder why you were not asked to find the maximising value of . If you are feeling
exceptionally energetic, you could try to solve f () = 0. This will eventually lead you to the rather

discouraging quartic equation

                                     4 + 43 + 22 - 8 + 3 = 0 .

You will have done a lot of tedious work to obtain an equation that cannot be solved without either a
formula for the solutions of a general quartic equation or a computer. There are in fact two real solutions
of this equation,  = 0.528 and  = 0.704.

Problem 56: A chocolate orange  ()

A chocolate orange consists of a sphere of delicious smooth uniform chocolate of mass M and
radius a, sliced into segments by planes through a fixed axis. It stands on a horizontal table with
this axis vertical and it is held together by a narrow ribbon round its equator. Show that the
tension in the ribbon is at least 332 M g.
[You may assume that the centre of mass of a segment of angle 2 is at distance 3a sin  from

                                                                                                                16

Comments

This question can be done by the usual methods (resolving forces and taking moments about a suitably
chosen point). Since the chocolate is smooth, there is no friction. The ribbon may be elastic, so it could
be tighter than is needed just to keep the orange together. At the lowest tension possible the orange is
on the point of falling apart, so there are no forces between the faces of the segments, except at the point
of contact with the table.

The ribbon is said to be thin, but actually this has to be interpreted as massless as well as thin; a ribbon
with mass would simply drop off the equator of the orange.

Notice that the question does not say that the segments are all the same size. That suggests that we
should look at just one segment, expecting to find that the tension required for that segment is indepen-
dent of the angle of the segment.

When I set this question originally on a 1985 examination paper (pre-dating STEP, which started in 1987),
I gave the wrong formula for the distance of the centre of mass of the segment, and the answer for the
tension was also incorrect, but consistent with the incorrect formula. Not surprisingly, no one pointed it
out, either at the time or afterwards. With a bit of luck, it is correct now.

I sent a copy of the examination paper to a well-known manufacturer of high quality chocolate confec-
tions30 and was rewarded with a puzzled letter and a parcel; not as large a parcel as I had hoped for
(perhaps they spotted the incorrect formula), but better than nothing. It seemed worth including the
question in this book in case they wanted an opportunity to make amends . . . .

30 Originally, the firm made chocolate apples which, being apple-shaped, would not have worked well for this question (the centre
   of mass of an orange segment was hard enough for me). The chocolate lemon, introduced in 1979, would not have been good
   either but luckily it was discontinued rapidly after it turned out that no one wanted to eat it.

The above diagram shows a horizontal cross-section of a segment of the orange.
Resolving the tension T in the ribbon as shown gives a horizontal component of force due to tension on
the segment of 2T sin  towards the left of the diagram.
The volume of the segment is a fraction 2/(2) of the volume of the sphere, so the segment has mass
M (2)/(2). The weight of the segment gives a force of M g / acting downwards through the centre
of mass as shown in the diagram below, which is a vertical cross-section of a segment.

which gives the required answer.

Post-mortem

Another way of tackling this sort of problem is to use the principle of virtual work, for which you
imagine that the system relaxes a very small amount (in this case, by allowing the ribbon to stretch) and
equate the work done against the constraints (here, tension times extension) to the change of potential
energy of the system, to obtain a formula for the constraint force (here, the tension). In many cases, this
method is simpler, but here it turns out to be very difficult: not recommended at all. The difficulty is
that if the orange relaxes so that each segment is now inclined at a small angle  to the vertical, quite a
lot of work is needed to calculate how far the centre of mass has fallen, even working to lowest order
in .

between the sides of the lorry. A horizontal force P acts on the lorry through G , as shown.

(i) If the normal reactions on the lower and higher wheels of the lorry are equal, show that the
       sum of the frictional forces between the wheels and the ground is zero.

Comments

There is not much more to this than just resolving forces and taking moments about a suitable point.
You might think it a bit odd to have a force that acts horizontally through the centre of gravity of the
lorry: it is supposed to be centrifugal. The first draft of the question was intended as a model of a lorry
going round a bend on a cambered road. The idea was to relate the speed of the lorry to the angle of
camber: the speed should be chosen so that there is no tendency to skid. However, the modelling part
of the question was eventually abandoned.
You can do the second part algebraically (using equations derived from resolving forces and taking
moments), but there is a more direct approach.
There was a slight inaccuracy in the wording of the question, which I have not corrected here. Maybe
you will spot it in the course of your solution. The diagram is correct.
132 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 57

Let the normal reactions at the lower and upper wheels be N1 and N2 , respectively, and let the frictional
forces at the lower and upper wheels be F1 and F2 , respectively, (both up the plane).
(i) Taking moments about G, we have

                                      (N1 - N2)d = (F1 + F2)h  ()

so if N1 = N2 the sum of the frictional forces is zero.

(ii) The condition for the lorry not tip over down the plane is N2  0 , which is the same as saying that
the total moment of W and P about the point of contact between the lower wheel and the plane in the
clockwise sense is positive. This gives P  W tan( + ) after a bit of geometry. Actually, working out
the shortest distance between the line of action of the forces and the wheels requires a bit of thought. You
find that  +  is the angle between the vertical and the lines joining G to the wheels. This is obvious, at
least in retrospect: if the plane were not tilted, the angle would be  and tilting just increases this by the
angle of tilt.

The other inequality comes from a similar calculation using the other wheel.

Post-mortem

I expect that you found that really clear and BIG diagrams made the question much easier: that is nearly
always the case with mechanics.

The slight inaccuracy in the question occurs because if the line of action of P passes between the wheels
of the lorry (not, as shown in the diagram, higher than the higher wheel), then the lorry cannot tip over
up the plane however large P is. The given inequality is not correct in this case, which corresponds to
 +  > 12  and therefore tan( + ) < 0.
An alternative way of obtaining the inequalities of part (ii) is to work with the resultant of P and W . The
direction of this resultant force must be such that its line of action passes between the wheels. The line
of action makes an angle of tan-1(P/W ) with the vertical through G and the inequalities follow after
the same geometry as in the answer to part (ii) above.

Problem 58: Fielding  ()

takes the catch just in front of her eye. The angle between the horizontal and her line of sight at
a time t after the ball is struck is . Show that d (tan ) is constant during the flight.

The next ball is also struck in the direction of the fielder but at a different velocity. In order to
be perfectly placed to catch the ball, the fielder runs at constant speed towards the batsman.

Comments

As with all the very best questions, nine-tenths of this question is submerged below the surface. It uses
the deepest properties of Newtonian dynamics, and a good understanding of the subject makes the
question completely transparent. However, it can still be done without too much trouble by a straight-
forward approach, in which case the difficulty lies only in setting it up for yourself.
The cleverness of this question lies in its use of two fundamental invariances of Newton's second law:

                                                               d2x

The first is invariance under time reflection symmetry, which arises because equation () is not affected
by the transformation t  -t. This means that any given solution can be replaced by one where the
projectile goes back along the trajectory, i.e. time runs backwards.
The second is invariance under what are called Galilean transformations. Equation () is also invariant
under the transformation x  x + vt, where v is an arbitrary constant velocity. This means that we can
solve the equation in a frame that moves with constant speed.

We take a straightforward approach. Let the height above the fielder's eye level at which the ball is
struck be h. Let the speed at which the ball is struck be u and the angle which the trajectory of the ball
initially makes with the horizontal be .
Then, taking x to be the horizontal distance of the ball at time t from the point at which the ball was
struck and y to be the height of the ball at time t above the fielder's eye level31, we have

                                        x = (u cos )t , y = h + (u sin )t - 12 gt2 .

Let d be the horizontal distance of the fielder from the point at which the ball is struck, and let T be the
time of flight of the ball. Then

                                        d = (u cos )T , 0 = h + (u sin )T - 12 gT 2                                            ()

and

                                 d-x                d - (u cos )t

                                           = -(u sin )T + 12 gT 2 + (u sin )t - 21 gt2                                         (using )
                                                         (u cos )T - (u cos )t

                                           = -(u sin )(T - t) + 12 g(T 2 - t2)
                                                         (u cos )(T - t)

                                           = -u sin  + 21 g(T + t) .                                (cancelling the factor (T - t))
                                                       u cos 

This last expression is a polynomial of degree one in t, so its derivative is constant, as required.

For the second part, let l be the distance from the fielder's original position to the point at which she

catches the ball. Then l = vT and

                        tan  = y = y = -u sin  + 21 g(T + t)
                                 (l - vt) + d - x v(T - t) + d - x                            v + u cos 

cancelling the factor of (T - t) as before. This again has constant derivative.

Post-mortem

The invariance mentioned in the comments section above can be used to answer the question almost
without calculation.

Using time reflection symmetry to reverse the trajectory shows that the batsman is completely irrelevant:

it only matters that the fielder caught a ball. We just think of the ball being projected from the fielder's

hands (the time-reverse of a catch). Taking her hands as the origin of coordinates, and using u to denote

the projection (i.e. the catching) speed of the ball and  to be the angle of projection (i.e. the final value

of  ),  we  have  y  =  (u  sin  )t  -  1  gt2,  x  =  (u  cos  )t  and  tan    =  (u  sin    -  1  gt)/u  cos  .  The  first  derivative
                                        2                                                        2

of this expression is constant, as before.

We use the Galilean transformation for the second part of the question. Instead of thinking of the fielder
running with constant speed v towards the batsman, we can think of the fielder being stationary and
the ball having an additional horizontal speed of v. The situation is therefore not changed from that of
the first part of the question, except that u cos  should be replaced by v + u cos .

Comments

This is a pretty standard situation: a rod leaning against a wall, prevented from slipping by friction at
both ends. The only slight variation is that the rod is not uniform; the only effect of this is to alter the
position of the centre of gravity through which the weight of the rod acts.

The question is not general, since the coefficient of friction is the same at both ends of the rod. I think
that it is a good idea (at least, if you are not working under examination conditions) to set out the
general equations (with coefficients of friction 킕 and 킖 and frictional forces FA and FB) without at
first assuming limiting friction. This will help understand the structure of the equations and highlight
the symmetry between the ends of the rod.

You might wonder why the weight per unit length is given in such a complicated way; why not simply
kx? The reason is to keep the dimensions honest. The factor of W/l appears so that the dimension
is clearly weight divided by length. Then x appears only divided by l to make a dimensionless ratio.
Finally, the factor of  is required for the total weight of the rod to be W .

The equations that determine the equilibrium are

                           FB + RA = W
                           FA - RB = 0
           RBx sin  + FBx cos  = RA(l - x) cos  - FA(l - x) sin 

If the rod is about to slip then the frictional and normal forces at A can be specified as FA = 킩A and
FB = 킩B. Substituting in the first two of the above equations gives

                                       W         킯                 킯          2W
                        RA = 2 + 1 , RB = 2 + 1 , FA = 2 + 1 , FB = 2 + 1 .

Substituting into the third equation gives the required result.

For  the  final  part,  setting     =  3  gives
                                       2
                                                           2 - 32
                                                 tan  = 5

If the rod slips for any angle less than  = 14 , then the angle at which limiting friction occurs at both

ends must be at least 14 . Therefore             2 - 32  1
                                                    5

i.e. 32 + 5 - 2  0, or (3 - 1)( + 2)  0. The greatest possible value of  is 13 .

Post-mortem

In the original version, the question spoke about limiting friction without saying that it was limiting at
both ends. We then wondered whether the friction could be limiting at one end only. The answer is
yes. The three equations that govern the system do not determine uniquely the four unknown forces
(normal reaction and frictional forces at each end of the rod); extra information is required. If the angle
is also to be determined, two extra pieces of information are required; in this case the information is that
the friction is limiting at both ends.

at distinct points along a straight line in gravity-free space. The particle P1 is set in motion

where 0 < e < 1.

Comments

This situation models the toy called `Newton's Cradle' which consists of four or more heavy metal balls
suspended from a frame so that they can swing. At rest, they are in contact in a line. When the first ball
is raised and let swing, there follows a rather pleasing pattern of impacts. In this case, the coefficient of
restitution is nearly 1 and the balls all have the same mass, so, as the first displayed formula shows, the
impacting ball is reduced to rest by the impact. At the first swing of the ball, nothing happens except
that the first ball is reduced to rest and the last ball swings away. Note that this is consistent with the
balls being separated by a very small amount; what actually happens is that the ball undergoes a small
elastic deformation at the impact, and the impulse takes a small amount of time to be transmitted across
the ball to the next ball.

Solution to problem 60

(i) Let V1 and V2 be the velocities of P1 and P2 after the first collision. Using conservation of momentum
and Newton's law of impact at the first collision results in the equations

                            mV = mV1 + mqV2 , V1 - V2 = -eV ,

so                             (       )        ()
                            V1 = 1 - eq V and V2 = 1 + e V .
                                  1+q              1+q

(ii) Note that V1 is positive since eq  e2 < 1 . Conserving momentum and using Newton's law (and

doing a bit of algebra) shows that the speeds V2 and V3 of P2 and P3 after the next collision are given by

           (             )  (         )( )              ()                     ( 1 + e )2
              1 - eq           1 - eq 1 + e               1+e
           V2 = 1 + q V2 = 1 + q 1 + q V and V3 = 1 + q V2 = 1 + q V. ()

Note that V2  V1 so there is no further collision between P1 and P2. Applying this argument at each
collision shows that there are exactly N - 1 collisions: P1 with P2; P2 with P3; etc.

(iii) The speed of Pk after it has hit Pk+1 is (by extending ())
                                                    ( 1 - eq ) ( 1 + e )k-1
                                                                                  V,
                                                       1+q 1+q

and the speed of Pk+1 after this collision and before it hits Pk+2 is
                                                             ( 1 + e )k
                                                                          V.
                                                               1+q

If q = e,                             ( 1 - e2 )
                               V1 = 1 + e V = (1 - e)V

and similarly the final speeds of P2, . . . , PN-1 are all (1 - e)V . The final speed of PN is V . Thus the final

total kinetic energy is

    1 (m + mq +    + mqN-2)[(1 - e)V ]2 + 1 mqN-1V 2 = 1 m 1 - eN-1 (1 - e)2V 2 + 1 meN-1V 2

                                             =  1  m(1  -  e  +  eN  )V  2  ,
                                                2

(replacing all the q's with e's and summing the geometric progression). Thus the loss of kinetic energy
is

                                                  12 mV 2 - 12 m(1 - e + eN )V 2,

as required.

Post-mortem

There are two tricky aspects to these multiple collision questions. First there is the matter of notation.
Above, I have used a hat for the second collision of a particle (V2), retaining the subscript for labelling
particles. That works, but if P2 undergoes another collision, entailing a double hat, it starts getting
messy. You could use a different letter, but that gets confusing. The only good method is to use a double
subscript: Vm,n is the velocity of the mth particle after the nth collision. But that is a sledgehammer for
this nut of a question.

The other tricky aspect is getting the signs right. I always think of velocity (not speed), and it is always
positive for particles travelling to the right. I also use common sense to check each equation! As usual,
a good diagram of each collision is essential.

An automated mobile dummy target for gunnery practice is moving anti-clockwise around the

       angle through which the target rotates between the time at which the shell is fired and the

Comments

The rotation of the target is irrelevant for the first part, which contravenes the setters' rule of not intro-
ducing information before it is required. In this case, it seemed better to describe the set-up immediately
-- especially as you are asked for a familiar result.
Remember, when you are considering the roots of the quartic (which is really a quadratic in 2), that the
question gives  > 0 .
The hint in the last paragraph (`by considering ...') is supposed to direct you towards the relation be-
tween the coefficients in a quadratic equation and the sum and product of the roots; otherwise, you get
into some pretty heavy algebra.

Solution to problem 61

(i) This part is about the range of the gun. If the shell lands at distance x, then

                                       x = (V cos )t, 0 = (V sin )t - 12 gt2.

Eliminating t gives xg = V 2 sin 2. The range r is the largest value of x, which is given by rg = V 2.
The shell cannot reach the target (for any angle of elevation) if R > r, so the shell cannot hit its target if
V 2 < Rg.

(ii) The time of flight is R/(V cos ), and this must also equal the time for the target to rotate through ,
i.e. /. Thus cos  = R/(V ). Substituting this into the range equation Rg = 2V 2 sin  cos  gives

                                                               (             )1

                                            Rg = 2V 2 V 1 - 2V 2 .

Squaring both sides of the equation, and simplifying, leads to the given quadratic in 2. Solving the

quadratic using the quadratic formula gives

                                                     (                              )
                                       g22 = 22 V 2  V 4 - g2R2 .

Since V 2 > gR, both the values of 2 roots are real and positive, but they lead to only two relevant

values of  since we only want positive values.

(iii)  The  linear  distance  between  the  two  points   of  impact  is   2R  sin  21 (2  -   1).  Now  2    +  2    =  42V  2/g2

                                                                                                           1       2

and    22    =  4R24/g2  (sum  and     product   of  the  roots   of  the  quadratic),     so

Why do we get two values for ? In order to hit the large circle, if it is in range, we can fix any speed of
projection and choose the angle of projection appropriately. In general, there are two possible angles of
projection, one above 45 and one below 45 (satisfying sin 2 = Rg/V 2).
However, in this question, we want to hit the circle essentially at a given time (when the target is at
the landing place), which means that V cos  is fixed, though of course it is a little more complicated
because the position of the target is fixed but unknown. But still, the two values of , corresponding to
two different angles of elevation, emerge in the same way.
Did you notice the slight inaccuracy in the question? The final `distance' could be negative (if for exam-

Comments

I was surprised at the difficulty of this problem, compared with a particle on a fixed wedge. There
is an easier method (just using forces and Newton's second law) but the route suggested here uses
basic principles, the outcomes of which are the numbered parts of the question. For a fixed wedge, the
horizontal component of momentum is not conserved, because of the force required to hold the wedge;
but (i) and (iii) are just what you would use in the fixed case.

Part (ii) is used only (apart from the very last result) to show that the angle  is constant. At first sight,
this is a bit surprising: it means that the particle moves in a straight line.

Most of the important intermediate results are given to you, but it is still very good discipline to check
that they hold in special cases: for example, k = 0 corresponding to a massless particle or equivalently
a fixed wedge; and  = 0 or  = 12  corresponding to a horizontal or vertical wedge face. You should
check that you understand what should happen in these special cases and that your understanding is
consistent with the formulae.
142 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 62

(i) This equation follows immediately from the constraint placed on the particle: it remains in contact
with the plane so components of the velocities of the particle and the wedge perpendicular to the face
must be equal.

(ii) Horizontal momentum is conserved, so M V = mv cos . Substitution for V /v using (i) gives

k cos  = V = sin( - ) = sin  cos  - sin  cos  = sin  - cos 
                        v            sin                sin                      tan 

which leads immediately to the required result. Note that the angle  remains constant in the motion.

(iii) Conservation of energy gives

                        mgy = 12 M V 2 + 12 mv2,  i.e.  kgy  =  1  (k  v  cos    )2  +  12 kv2.
                                                                2

Thus 2gy = (k cos2  + 1)v2.

The next step is to write v in terms of y to obtain the differential equation. The vertical component of

velocity is v sin , so

                                           v sin  = dy .
                                                       dt

Now using the result of (iii) gives

                                                        

dy                                   2gy   2 sin  =             2gy sin2                1 1         ()
    = v sin  =                                                                   2 = (2g ) 2 y 2 .
dt                                   1 + k cos            1 + (K - 1) cos 

Squaring gives the required result, and we can use part (ii) to obtain the expression for g in terms of 
and K.
Now, at last, we use the hard-won result that , and hence g, is constant. The equation

                                                           ( dy  )2
                                                              dt = 2g y

is exactly the same as the equation of conservation of energy for a particle falling vertically in a gravita-
tional field of strength g. For such a particle, we have y = 12 gt2, as required.

Post-mortem

The basic principles behind this solution are conservation of momentum and energy, together with
the constraint that the particle moves on the surface of the face of the wedge. The benefit of using
conservation of energy is that you do not have to worry about the normal reaction force, because it does
no work.
Of course, we could obtain the final result by integrating the differential equation (), which takes only
a few lines.

Problem 63: Sphere on step  ()

A uniform solid sphere of radius a and mass m is drawn very slowly and without slipping
from horizontal ground onto a step of height 12 a by a horizontal force of magnitude F which
is always applied to the highest point of the sphere and is always perpendicular to the vertical
plane which forms the face of the step. Find the maximum value of F in the motion, and prove

                                                                                                                       
that the coefficient of friction between the sphere and the edge of the step must exceed 1/ 3.

                                                                                                                               1997 Paper II

Comments

This is quite straightforward once you have realised that very slowly means so slowly that the sphere can
be considered to be static at each position. You just have to solve a statics problem with the usual tools:
resolving forces and taking moments about suitably chosen points.
It seems odd to have a force that always acts at the highest point of the sphere. The idea is that there is
a string wrapped round the sphere and it is being pulled horizontally to get the sphere up the step.

Let the angle between the radius to the point of contact with the step and the downward vertical be ,
as shown. At the point of contact, let the frictional force, which is tangent to the sphere, be f and the
reaction R (along the radius of the sphere).

To investigate F , we take moments about a point cunningly chosen to eliminate other unknown forces.
Since the lines of action both R and f pass through the point of contact of the sphere with the step, we
can eliminate both forces by taking moments about this point:

                                               F a(1 + cos ) = mga sin  ,

so
                                                F = mg sin  1 + cos  = mg tan 21  .

This takes its maximum value when  is largest, i.e. when the sphere just touches the horizontal ground.
                                                                    
At  this  position,  cos   =  1  and  sin   =  1  3 and Fmax = mg/  3.
                              2                2

Taking moments about the centre of the sphere (to eliminate the normal reaction and weight) gives

F = f , and resolving forces parallel to the radius at the point of contact gives

                                                  R = F sin  + mg cos .

Now                                            sin2   1 - cos2 

                              F sin  = mg 1 + cos  = mg 1 + cos  = mg(1 - cos )

so R = mg. We therefore need 탆g > Fmax, as required.

Post-mortem

Should we have known that R = mg (in the last line of the solution)? It doesn't look obvious from
the diagram. However, if we follow the principle, used twice already, of taking moments about a point
that eliminates unwanted forces, the result drops out. To relate mg and R directly, we need to eliminate
F and f . We therefore need to take moments about the intersection of the lines of action of these two
forces, which is shown in the diagram (call it P ). Moments must balance about any point: it doesn't
matter whether the point is inside the body, or outside it as in the case of P . It is easy to see from the
geometry (f and F act along tangents to the sphere) that the distances from P to the lines of action of
mg and R are equal, which means that the two forces are equal.

To be precise about the meaning of slow in this context, you have to compare the dynamic forces con-
nected with the motion of the sphere with the static forces. The motion of the sphere is rotation about
the fixed point of contact with the step. If we assume that the centre moves with constant speed, the
only extra force due to the motion is an additional reaction at the point of contact with the step. This
reaction is centrifugal in nature and so is roughly of the form mv2/a, which is to be small compared
with R. The static approximation (`very slowly') is therefore valid if v2  ga.

Solution to problem 64

The diagram below shows the system when the particle has fallen a distance a from its initial position.

                                                   a                        a

                                                                   2a

A bit of geometry (including Pythagoras) on the above diagram shows that the length of the extended
                                    
band  is  2a   -  2a  cos-1  1  +  23  a  so  the  extension       of  the  band  is
                             2

                                   -2a cos 2 -1 ( 1 ) + 23 a , i.e. 2a(3 - 31 ) .

(i) At the lowest point, the speed is zero. That suggests using an energy equation, which will involve
speed and displacement (for the potential energy) but not acceleration.

Conserving energy (taking the initial potential energy to be zero), we find that when the particle has

fallen a distance a and has speed v,

                                              1 2 1 [2a(3 - 31 )]2
                                       0 = 2 mv + 2  2a                               - mga .

At the lowest point, v = 0, which gives the required answer.

(ii) Now we are interested in the point where the speed is greatest, i.e. where the acceleration is zero, so
this time we should use the equation of motion of the particle.

The component of the tension T in the band in the vertical direction, acting upwards on the particle,
when the particle has fallen a distance y is 2T cos  where sin  = a/(a + y). Applying Newton's second
law to the motion of the particle gives

                                                   my = 2T cos  - mg ,                                             ()

where, by Hooke's law, T =   extension/2a . At the maximum speed, y = 0. This occurs at y = a, so

() becomes                                         2a(3 - 31 ) 3

                                              0 = 2 2a                         2 - mg .

In this case  =                 .

The question was relatively simple because you only needed to evaluate energy or tension at very special

points: maximum extension or maximum speed. You could of course have worked from the general

the  final  are  drawn  at  random,  and  in  any  match  either  player  has  a  probability  1  of  winning.
                                                                                               2

Two players are chosen at random before the start of the first round. Find the probabilities that

they play each other:

(i) in the first round;

(ii) in the final round;

(iii) in the tournament.

                                                                                  1987 Specimen Paper II

Comments

Note that the set-up is not the usual one for a tennis tournament, where the only random element is in
the first round line-up. Two players cannot then meet in the final if they are in the same half of the draw.
Part (i) is straightforward, but parts (ii) and (iii) need a bit of thought. There is a short way and a long
way of tackling these parts, and both have merits.
It is a good plan to check your answers, if possible, by reference to simple special cases where you can
see what the answers should be; n = 1 or n = 2, for example.
Interestingly, the answers are independent of the probability that the players have of winning a match;
the 2s in the answers represent the number of players in each match rather than (the reciprocal of) the
probability that each player has of winning a match. It also does not matter how the draw for each
round is made. This is clear if you use the short method mentioned above.

Solution to problem 65

Call the two players P1 and P2.
(i) Once P1 has been given a slot, there are 2n - 1 slots for P2, in only one of which will he or she play P1.
The probability of P1 playing P2 is therefore

                                                               1.
                                                            2n - 1

Note that this works for n = 1 and n = 2.

(ii) Long way. To meet in the final, P1 and P2 must each win every round before the final, and must also

not meet before the final. The probability that P1 and P2 do not meet in the first round and that they

both win their first round matches, is

                                      (      1       )   1                1 ( 2n-1 - 1 )

                                      1 - 2n - 1 22 i.e. 2 2n - 1 .

The probability that they win each round and do not meet before the final (i.e. for n - 1 rounds) is

               1 ( 2n-1 - 1 ) 1 ( 2n-2 - 1 )                          1 ( 21 - 1 )                11
               2 2n - 1  2 2n-1 - 1      2 22 - 1                                    i.e. 2n-1 2n - 1 .

(ii) Short way. Since all processes are random here, the probability that any one pair contests the final is

the  same  as  that  for  any  other  pair.  There  are  a  total  of  1    2n(2n  -  1)  different  pairs,  so  the  probability
                                                                       2

for any given pair is 1/[2n-1(2n - 1)].

(iii) Long way. We need to add the probabilities that P1 and P2 meet in each round. The probability that
they meet in the kth round is the probability that they reach the kth round times the probability that they
meet in the kth round given that they reach it, the latter (conditional) probability being 1/(2n-k+1 - 1),
as can be inferred from part (i). As in part (ii), the probability that they reach the kth round is

                                                       1 2n-k+1 - 1
                                                     2k-1 2n - 1 ,

so the probability that they meet in the kth round is

                                      1 2n-k+1 - 1                 1            11
                                                                            =                 .
                               2k-1          2n - 1         2n-k+1     -1       2k-1   2n  -1

Summing this as a geometric progression from k = 1 to n gives 1/2n-1.

(iii) Short way. By the same short argument as in part (ii), the probability of a given pair meeting in any
given match (not necessarily the final) is 1/[2n-1(2n - 1)]. Since the total number of matches is 2n - 1
(because one match is needed to knock out each player, and all players except one get knocked out), the
probability of a given pair playing is

                                                     2n - 1                  1
                                                2n-1(2n - 1) = 2n-1 .

Post-mortem

If (like me) you plodded through this question the long way, you might be wondering how you were
supposed to think of the short way. Instead of working out what happens to individual players as they
progress through the tournament, you think about the space of all possible outcomes (the sample space),
and attach a probability to each. That way, you can use the symmetry between all the players to help
you.

Problem 66: Harry the calculating horse                                                                 ()

Harry the Calculating Horse will do any mathematical problem I set him, providing the answer

is 1, 2, 3 or 4. When I set him a problem, he places a hoof on a large grid consisting of unit

squares and his answer is the number of squares partly covered by his hoof. Harry has circular

hoofs,   of  radius  1  unit.
                     4

After many years of collaboration, I suspect that Harry no longer bothers to do the calculations,

instead merely placing his hoof on the grid completely at random. I often ask him to divide 4 by

4,  but  only  about    1  of  his  answers  are  right;  I  often  ask  him  to  add  2  and  2,  but  disappointingly
                        4

only about 161  of his answers are right. Is this consistent with my suspicions?

I decide to investigate further by setting Harry many problems, the answers to which are 1, 2, 3,

or 4 with equal frequency. If Harry is placing his hoof at random, find the expected value of his

answers. The average of Harry's answers turns out to be 2. Should I get a new horse?

                                                                                                        1997 Paper II

Comments

Hans von Osten, a horse, lived in Berlin around the turn of the last century. He was known far and
wide for his ability to solve complex arithmetical problems. Distinguished scientists travelled to Berlin
to examine Hans and test his marvellous ability. They would write an equation on a chalkboard and
Hans would respond by pawing the ground with his hoof. When Hans reached the answer he would
stop. Though he sometimes made errors, his success rate was far higher than would be expected if his
answers were random. The accepted verdict was that Hans could do arithmetic.

Hans's reputation as a calculating horse nosedived when an astute scientist simply made sure that nei-
ther the person asking the questions nor the audience knew the answers. Hans became an instant failure.
His success was based on his ability to sense any change in the audience: a lifted eyebrow, a sigh, a nod-
ding head or the tensing of muscles was enough to stop him from pawing the ground. Anyone who
knew the answer was likely to give almost imperceptible clues to the horse. But we shouldn't overlook
Hans's talents: at least he had terrific examination technique.

We are investigating the situation when Harry places his hoof at random, so that the probability that the
centre of his hoof lands in any given region is proportional to the area of the region. We therefore move
swiftly from a question about probability to a question about areas. You just have to divide a given
square into regions, each determined by the number of squares that will be partially covered by Harry's
hoof if its centre lands in the region under consideration. Remember that the areas must add to one, so
the most difficult area calculation can be left until last and deduced from the others.

To answer the last part properly, you really need to set out a hypothesis testing argument: you will accept
the null hypothesis (random hoof placing) if, using the distribution implied by the null hypothesis, the
probability of obtaining the given result is greater than some pre-decided figure. Obviously, nothing so
elaborate was intended here, since it is the last demand of an already long question: just one line would
do.
150 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 66

The diagram shows one square of the grid.

Harry's hoof will land completely within exactly one square if he places the centre of his hoof in a square

of  side   1  centred   on  the  centre   of  any  square,  shown       with  horizontal  and     vertical   lines  in   the  diagram.
           2

The area of any such square is            1  square units.
                                          4

His  hoof     will  partially  cover    exactly  four  squares  if  he  places  the  centre   in  a  circle  of  radius   1  centred  on
                                                                                                                          4

any intersection of grid lines. The total area of any one such circle is 161  square units, which may be

thought of as four quarter circles, one in each corner of any given square, shown lightly shaded in the

diagram.

His  hoof     will  partially    cover  exactly  two   squares  if  he  places  the  centre  in   any  one   of  four  1  by  1  rectan-
                                                                                                                       2      4

gles,  of  total  area  4    1  in  any  given  square,  shown     darkly    shaded  in  the  diagram.
                              8

Otherwise, his hoof will partially cover three squares; the area of this remaining region, shown with no

shading in the diagram, is

                                                       1- 1 -  - 1 .
                                                            4 16 2

If Harry placed his hoof at random, the probabilities of the different outcomes would be equal to the
corresponding area calculated above (divided by the total area of the square, which is 1). Thus the data
given in the question are exactly consistent with random placement.

The expected value given random placements is

                                                       (                        )
                               1 1 +2 1 +3 1- 1 - 1 -  +4  =2+ 
                                     4        2                 4 2 16                    16           16

The expected value (given that Harry gets all questions right) is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)/4 = 5/2 . Harry has a less
accurate expected value even than the random expected value. He is clearly hopeless and should go.

Post-mortem

The explanations in the first paragraph of the solution are very concise. To understand them, you should
draw yourself lots of diagrams.

The proportion of Harry's answers that are correct, in the case of the 2 + 2 calculation, is given as
`about 116 '. That should have given you pause for thought. Why not 15 ? Clearly, it was supposed to
be helpful, so it should have been no surprise that the probability of getting the answer 4 under the
random assumption turned out to be exactly 116 . Of course, these questions shouldn't turn into a game
of spotting hidden clues, but it is always worth looking for unusual features of a question -- or of any
mathematical problem.

Problem 67: PIN guessing                              ()

In order to get money from a cash dispenser I have to punch in a Personal Identification Number.

I have forgotten my PIN, but I do know that it is equally likely to be any one of the integers 1,

2, . . . , n. I plan to punch in integers in ascending order until I get the right one. I can do this at

the rate of r integers per minute. As soon as I punch in the first wrong number, the police will

be alerted. The probability that they will arrive within a time t minutes is 1 - e-t, where  is

a positive constant. If I follow my plan, show that the probability of the police arriving before I

get my money is

                          n 1 - e-(k-1)/r
                                                   .

                          k=1 n

Simplify the sum.
On past experience, I know that I will be so flustered that I will just punch in possible integers
at random, without noticing which I have already tried. Show that the probability of the police
arriving before I get my money is

                                         1
                          1 - -/r .

Comments

This was originally about getting money from a cash dispenser using a stolen card, but it was decided
that STEP questions should not be immoral. Hence the rather more improbable scenario.
The exponential distribution, here governing the police arrival time, is often used for failure of equipment
(light-bulbs, etc). It has the useful property (not used here) that the reliability for a light bulb (here
the probability of the police not coming within a certain time period of duration t) doesn't depend on
which time period you choose; i.e. given that the light bulb has survived to time T , the probability of it
surviving until time T + t is independent of T (which doesn't seem very suitable for light bulbs). This
is referred to as the memoryless property.
To simplify the sums, you have to recognise a geometric series where the common ratio of terms is an
exponential; not difficult, but easy to miss the first time you see it.
152 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 67

The probability that I get the right number on the kth go is 1/n . The time taken to key in k integers32 is
(k - 1)/r . The probability that the police arrive before this is 1 - e-(k-1)/r so the total probability that
the police arrive before I get my money is

                                                   n 1 (  1 - e-(k-1)/r) .
                                                        n

                                                                        k=1

We have  n 1 ( ) n  1 - e-(k-1)/r = 1 - e-(k-1)/r = 1 - 1 - e-n/r ,

         k=1   n                              k=1                  n  n(1 - e-/r)

since the last part of the sum is a geometric progression with common ratio e-/r .

This time, the probability of getting my money on the kth go is 1/n times the probability of not having
punched in the correct integer in the preceding k - 1 turns:

                                                 1 ( n - 1 )k-1
                  P(money on kth go) = n  n .

Thus the probability of the police arriving before I get my money is

  1 ( n - 1 -(k-1)/r )k-1 ( ) 1 1 1 1
         n n      1-e                       = n  1 - (n - 1)/n - n  1 - e-/r(n - 1)/n ,

k=1

which is easily seen to be the given answer.

Post-mortem

For each part, you have to calculate the probability of the first success occurring on the kth go. You
have to remember to multiply the probability of success on this go by the probability of failure on the
preceding k - 1 goes -- a very typical idea in this sort of probability question. After that, the question is
really just algebra. STEP questions on this sort of material nearly always involve significant algebra or
calculus.

Car batteries as well as light bulbs often crop up as examples of objects to which exponential reliability
can be applied. Suppose your car battery has a guarantee of three years, and your car is completely
destroyed after two years. Your insurance company offers to give you one third of the price of the
battery. What do you think they would say to your counterclaim for the full price, based on the fact that,
given it had lasted two years, the exponential model says that it would have had an expected further
three years of life in it?

Problem 68: Breaking plates  ()

Four students, one of whom is a mathematician, take turns at washing up over a long period
of time. The number of plates broken by any student in this time obeys a Poisson distribution,
the probability of any given student breaking n plates being e-n/n! for some fixed constant
, independent of the number of breakages by other students. Given that five plates are broken,
find the probability that three or more were broken by the mathematician.

                                                                                                                                2001 Paper I

Comments

The way this is set up, it is largely a counting exercise (but see the post-mortem). To start with, you work
out the probability of 5 breakages, then follow that with the probability that the mathematician broke
3 or more plates. You need to calculate the number of ways that 5 plates can be shared amongst four
students, for which you have to consider each partition of the number 5 and the number of different
ways it can arise.
154 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 68

First we work out the probability of 5 breakages.
Let P(5, 0, 0, 0) denote the probability that student A breaks 5 plates and students B, C and D break 0
plates. Then

P(5, 0, 0, 0) = (Prob. of breaking 5)  (Prob. of breaking 0)3 = e-5 (e-)3 = 5e-4 .
                                                                         5!                 5!

The probability that one student breaks all the plates is 4  5e-4/5!, the factor 4 because it could be
any one of the four students.

Let P(4, 1, 0, 0) denote the probability that student A breaks 4 plates, student B breaks 1 plate and stu-
dents C and D break 0 plates. Then

P(4, 1, 0, 0) = (Prob. of breaking 4)  (Prob. of breaking 1)  (Prob. of breaking 0)2

                = e-4 e- (e-)2 = 5e-4 .
                               4! 1!      4!

The probability that any one student breaks 4 plates and any other student breaks 1 plate is therefore
4  3  5e-4/4! .

Considering P(3, 2, 0, 0), P(3, 1, 1, 0), P(2, 2, 1, 0) and P(2, 1, 1, 1) in turn, together with the number of

different ways these probabilities can occur, shows that the probability of 5 breakages is

             (                                                        )      ()
5e-4 4 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 4                                           = 5e-4 1024 .
                5! 4! 1! 3! 2! 3! 1! 1! 2! 2! 1! 2! 1! 1! 1!                 5!

The probability that the mathematician (student A, say) breaks 3 or more is P(5, 0, 0, 0) + 3P(4, 1, 0, 0) +

3P(3, 2, 0, 0) + 3P(3, 1, 1, 0), i.e.

                                       (                           )     ()
                5e-4 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 5e-4 106 .
                                          5! 4! 1! 3! 2! 3! 1! 1!        5!

The probability that the mathematician breaks 3 or more, given that 5 are broken, is therefore 106/1024 .

Post-mortem

If you did the question by the method suggested above, you will probably be wondering about the
answer: why is it independent of ; and why is the denominator 45? You will quickly decide that the
Poisson distribution was a red herring (though I promise you that it was not an intentional herring),
since there is no trace of the distribution in the answer.

The denominator is pretty suggestive. A completely different approach is as follows, It is clear that the

probability that the mathematician breaks any given plate is 14 . The probability that he or she breaks k

plates is therefore binomial:             (5) ( 1 )k ( 3 )5-k

                                          k4 4

and adding the cases k = 3, k = 4 and k = 5 gives rather rapidly

                                                            90 + 15 + 1 .

For the method given in the solution, we could substitute Pk for e-k/k! (as the probability of breaking
k plates) and the calculation would work just the same, with all the Pks disappearing; try it.

Problem 69: Lottery                                                 ()

The national lottery of Ruritania is based on the positive integers from 1 to N , where N is very

large and fixed. Tickets cost 1 each. For each ticket purchased, the punter (i.e. the purchaser)

chooses a number from 1 to N . The winning number is chosen at random, and the jackpot is

shared equally amongst those punters who chose the winning number.

A syndicate decides to buy N tickets, choosing every number once to be sure of winning a share

of the jackpot. The total number of tickets purchased in this draw is 3.8N and the jackpot is 즋 .

Assuming that the non-syndicate punters choose their numbers independently and at random,

find the most probable number of winning tickets and show that the expected net loss of the

syndicate is approximately      5(1 - e-2.8)

Comments

This is a Binomial distribution problem: the probability that n out of m punters choose the winning

ticket is                   ()
                              m pnqm-n
                              n

where here m = 2.8N , p = 1/N and q = 1 - p. It is clear that an approximation to the Binomial
distribution is expected (for example, the question uses the word `approximately' and you have to think
about how an approximation might arise); and the presence of the exponential in the given result gives a
pretty broad hint that it should be a Poisson distribution -- the use of which has to be justified. One can
expect the Poisson approximation to work when the number of trials (call it m) is large (e.g. m > 150)
and when np  npq, i.e. the mean is roughly equal to the variance (since these are equal for the Poisson
distribution) -- so q  1.

You can't find the most probable number of winning tickets by differentiation (unless you fancy differ-
entiating the factorial x!); instead, you must look at the ratios of consecutive terms and see when these
turn from being greater than one to less than one.
156 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 69

Let X be the random variable whose value is the number of winning tickets out of the 2.8N tickets
purchased by the non-syndicate punters. Then X  Poisson(2.8) .

Let pj = P(X = j) . Then

                             pj =     (2.8)j e-2.8 pj+1 2.8           .
                                                               =
                                           j!               pj j + 1

This fraction is greater than 1 if j < 1.8, so the most probable number of winning tickets by non-
syndicate punters is 2. Overall (including the ticket bought by the syndicate), the most probable number
of winning tickets is 3, which is very plausible.

The expected winnings of the syndicate is

(                                     )                     (                                 )
 W p0 + 1 W p1 + 1 W p2 +    =              e-2.8W 1 + 1  1 (2.8) + 1  1 (2.8)2 +   
   2                      3                                    2 1!      3 2!

                                           =   e-2.8W e2.8 - 1 ,
                                                            2.8

so the expected loss is as given (note that 2.8 = 145 ).

Post-mortem

This is rather interesting. You might perhaps have considered whether it would be worth borrowing
money to buy every single lottery combination, in order to win a share of the jackpot. Clearly, the
people who run the lottery have to think about this sort of thing.

Suppose the number of tickets sold, excluding the N that we plan to buy, is expected to be kN . Suppose
also that a fraction  of the total is paid out in the jackpot. Then, setting 2.8 = k and W = (k + 1)N ,
the expected loss formula given in the question becomes

                                                      ( 1 - e-k )
                                                  N 1 - k (k + 1) .

If k is very small (take k = 0), we lose N (1 - ) (obviously). If k is large, k = 3 say, the exponential can
be ignored and we lose N (1 - (k + 1)/k). If k  1, this becomes N (1 - ) again. In between, there is a
value of k that, for each fixed , gives a minimum loss (which may be a gain if  is close to 1).

Note how informative it is to have k rather than 2.8; the numerical value was chosen in the question to
model roughly that lottery system in the UK.

Having gone back to this solution after a break, I am now wondering about the use of the Poisson
approximation. Of course, the set-up (large m, small p) begs us to approximate, but did we need to?
Certainly not for the first result, since we can just as well look at the ratio of two terms of the Binomial
distribution as at two terms of the Poisson distribution. Try it; the result is of course the same.

The second part is more difficult. What we want is the expectation of 1/(n + 1), and this turns out
to be a difficult sum using the Binomial distribution (in fact, it can only be expressed in terms of a
hypergeometric function, which would then have to be approximated to get a less obscure answer).

It seems to me that the solution above is therefore a bit unsatisfactory. It would surely have been better
to work with the exact distribution until it was necessary to approximate, even though one knows that
the approximation is so good that the answers would be the same. We are, after all, mathematicians and
not engineers.

Problem 70: Bodies in the fridge  ()

My two friends, who shall remain nameless, but whom I shall refer to as P and Q, both told me
this afternoon that there is a body in my fridge. I'm not sure what to make of this, because P
tells the truth with a probability of p, while Q (independently) tells the truth with a probability
of only q. I haven't looked in the fridge for some time, so if you had asked me this morning, I
would have said that there was just as likely to be a body in the fridge as not. Clearly, in view
of what my friends have told me, I must revise this estimate. Explain carefully why my new
estimate of the probability of there being a body in the fridge should be

                                                             pq
                                                                         .

                                                     1 - p - q + 2pq

I have now been to look in the fridge and there is indeed a body in it; perhaps more than one. It
seems to me that only my enemy E1 or my other enemy E2 or (with a bit of luck) both E1 and
E2 could be in my fridge, and this evening I would have judged these three possibilities equally
likely. But tonight I asked P and Q separately whether E1 was in the fridge, and they each said
that she was. What should be my new estimate of the probability that both E1 and E2 are in my
fridge?
Of course, I always tell the truth.

                                                                                                                               1987 Paper II

Comments

The most difficult part of this problem is unravelling the narrative! The first paragraph says essentially
`what is the probability that there is a body in the fridge, given that P and Q both say there is?'. It
can therefore be tackled by the usual methods of conditional probability: tree diagrams, for example,
or Bayes' theorem. All the other words in the first paragraph are there to tell you about the a priori
probabilities 33 of the events, without knowledge of which the question above would be meaningless.
In the second paragraph, the situation becomes more complicated, but the method used for the first
paragraph will still work.
In case you want to use it, here is the statement of Bayes' theorem, in its simplest form:

                                                  P(B|A) = P(B)  P(A|B) .
                                                                        P(A)

It is perhaps interesting to note that in 2002 it was decided that STEP questions should not be immoral
(see Problem 67); but this seemed to be less of an issue in 1987.

33 An a priori probability is a probability calculated theoretically (for example by using equally likely outcomes) or from exist-
   ing information regarding a situation. It can then be revised using additional information, when it becomes an a posteriori
   probability.
158 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 70

This problem can be solved using tree diagrams.                    A more sophisticated, but not necessarily better,
method is to use Bayes' theorem.
Here, we take the events A and B to be

                         A = P and Q both say that there is a body in the fridge
                         B = there is a body in the fridge

From the information given in the question, P (B) = 12 , so
                                                        1 P(B|A) = 2  pq .
                                                                        P(A)

Now

                   P(A) = P(there is a body)  P(P and Q both say there is)

                                             +P(there is not a body)  P(they both say there is)

                         =      1    pq  +  1    (1  -  p)(1  -  q)
                                2            2

which gives the required answer.
For the second paragraph, let

                                X = P and Q both say that E1 is in the fridge
                                Y = E1 and E2 are in the fridge

There are three possibilities (since we know that there is at least one body in the fridge): only E1 is in the

fridge; only E2 is in the fridge; and both E1 and E2 are in the fridge. These are given as equally likely,
so the a priori probabilities are each 13 .

We want P(Y |X), which by Bayes' theorem is

                                                P(Y )  P(X|Y ) 1 = 3  pq .
                                                       P(X )           P(X )

Now

       P(X) = P(only E1 is in the fridge)  P(P and Q told the truth)

                                +P(both E1 and E2 are in the fridge)  P(P and Q both told the truth )

                                      +P(only E2 is in the fridge)  P(P and Q both lied )

               =   1    pq  +  1    pq  +  1    (1  -  p)(1  -  q)
                   3            3            3

                               pq
so the answer is 1 - p - q + 3pq .

Post-mortem

Note how much more difficult it is when the answer is not given; when the question was originally set,

most candidates arrived at the given answer to the first part but were not sufficiently confident to extend

their  method  to  the  second  paragraph:      they   received    8   for  their  efforts.
                                                                   20

The last line of the question is not entirely frivolous; if I may have lied about what my friends answered

when I asked them if there is a body in the fridge, the problem becomes difficult. However, my claim to

be truthful is vacuous (it tells you nothing) because I may be lying. Contrast with the statement `I am

lying', which is inconsistent.

Problem 71: Choosing keys  ()

I have k different keys on my key ring. When I come home at night I try one key after another
until I find the key that fits my front door. What is the probability that I find the correct key, for
the first time, on the nth attempt in each of the following three cases?

(i) At each attempt, I choose a key that I have not tried before, each choice being equally likely.

(ii) At each attempt, I choose a key from all my keys, each of the k choices being equally likely.

(iii) At the first attempt, I choose from all my keys, each of the k choices being equally likely. At
       each subsequent attempt, I choose from the keys that I did not try at the previous attempt,
       each of the k - 1 choices being equally likely.

Comments

This is very easy, and would really be far too easy if the answers were given.
You should set out your argument clearly and concisely, because if you come up with the wrong answer
and an inadequate explanation you will not get many marks. Even if you write down the correct answer
you may not get the marks if your explanation is inadequate.
You should of course run the usual checks on your answers. Do they lie in the range 0  p  1? If you
sum over all outcomes, do you get 1? (The latter is a good and not difficult exercise; I insist that you try
it.)
You will probably be struck by the simplicity of the answer to part (i), after simplification. Is there an
easy way of thinking about it (or, if you did it the easy way, is there a hard way)?

Post-mortem

The above solution for part (i) is the `hard way'. The easy way is to consider the keys all laid out in a
row, instead of being picked sequentially. Exactly one of the keys is the correct one, which is equally
likely to be any of the keys in the row, so has a probability of 1/k of being in any given position. Clearly,
this corresponds exactly to picking them one by one.
I gave the hard solution above, because I think most people will be drawn into doing it this way by the
phrasing of the question: keys are picked one by one and tried before going on to the next.
Did you check that your probabilities sum to 1? It is obvious for part (i), but you have to sum geometric
progressions for parts (ii) and (iii).

This is impossible unless you know the following result:

If X1 and X2 are independent and normally distributed according to X1  N (1, 12) and X2  N (2, 22),

then  X1  +  X2  is  also  normally   distributed  and  X1  +   X2    N (1  +  2,  2    +  22).

                                                                                       1

Even if you didn't know this result, you do now and it should not be difficult to complete the first parts
of the question.

For the last part, you need to know something about conditional probability, namely that

                                           P(A B) = P(B  A)
                                                            P(B)

which makes sense intuitively and can easily be understood in terms of Venn diagrams. The denomi-
nator is essentially a normalising constant. The formula may be taken as the definition of conditional
probability on the left-hand side.

Then the probabilities of being late are, respectively, P(T1 > 105) and P(T2 > 100), i.e. 1 - ( 20 13 ) and

1  -  (2).  Note  that  (  20  )  <  (2).

We have

                                     L = [pA + (1 - p)B]M = [B + (A - B)p]M.

L increases as p increases, since A > B, hence the given inequalities corresponding to p = 0 and p = 1.

We have                        P(Kings Cross given late) = P(Late and Kings Cross)
                                                                                P(Late)

An estimate for p (call it p~) is therefore given by

                                           3 = Ap~ ,
                                           5 Ap~ + B(1 - p~)

so p~ = 3B .

Post-mortem

The result mentioned in the comment on the previous page is just the sort of thing you should try to
prove yourself rather than take on trust. Unfortunately, such results in probability tend to be pretty
hard to prove. You can also prove it fairly easily using generating functions (which are not on the STEP
specifications any longer). You can also prove it from first principles. That would be difficult because of
the awkward integrals involved, but not impossible.

Problem 73: Collecting voles                                               ()

A group of biologists attempts to estimate the magnitude, N , of an island population of voles

(Microtus agrestis). Accordingly, the biologists capture a random sample of 200 voles, mark them

and release them. A second random sample of 200 voles is then taken of which 11 are found to

be marked. Show that the probability, pN , of this occurrence is given by

                                     ((N - 200)!)2

                                 pN = k N !(N - 389)! ,

where k is independent of N .

The biologists then estimate N by calculating the value of N for which pN is a maximum. Find

this estimate.

All unmarked voles in the second sample are marked and then the entire sample is released.

Subsequently a third random sample of 200 voles is taken. Using your estimate for N , write

down the probability that this sample contains exactly j marked voles, leaving your answer in

terms of binomial coefficients.

Deduce that     200 (            )(           )(               )
                 389
                                     3247     =          3636     .

Comments

This is really just an exercise in combinations. (Recall that a permutation is a reordering of a set of
objects, and a combination is a selection of a subset from a set.) You assume that you are equally likely
to choose any given subset of the same size, so that the probability of a set of specific composition is the
number of ways of choosing a set of that composition divided by the total number of ways of choosing
any set of the same size. Of course, you are assuming that the voles are indistinguishable, except for the
marks made by the biologists.
Maximising a discrete (not a continuous) function of N came up on one of the previous questions: you
have to compare adjacent terms.
The numbers look rather bad, though they turn out OK. My instinct would be to do it algebraically
first: replace 200 by a and 11 by b, then substitute back at the end. I am sure it will lead to a better
understanding of what is going on.

Solution to problem 73

For the second sample, 200 out of N voles are already marked, so pN is just the number of ways of

choosing 11 from 200 and 189 from N - 200 divided by the number of ways of choosing 200 from N :

             ( )(                               )
             200 N - 200                           200! (N - 200)!

                        11                 189     = 11! 189! 189! (N - 389)! i ,
       pN =                 ()                                        N!
                                      N

                            200                          200! (N - 200)!

so
                                                                  (200!)2

                                                          k = 11! (189!)2 .

At the maximum value, pN  pN-1, i.e.

                                           (N - 200)2
                                           N (N - 389)  1 ,

which gives N  2002/11  3636 (just divide 40000 by 11).

At the third sample, there are 389 marked voles and an estimated 3636 - 389 = 3247 unmarked voles.

Hence                                              ( )(                                     )

                                                   389                                3247

                                                   j                         (  200 - j
       P(exactly j marked voles) =                                                    )
                                                                                               .

                                                                                3636

                                                                                200

The final part follows immediately, using

                         200
                            P(exactly j marked voles) = 1 .

                        j=0

Post-mortem

Adding the Latin name of the species was a nice touch, I thought (not my idea); it adds an air of verisimil-
itude to the problem.
I suppose that this might be the basis of a method of estimating the population of voles -- rather clever
really. I don't know how well it works in practice though. The assumption mentioned earlier, that
picking one set of voles of size 200 is just as likely as picking any other set, surely relies on perfect
mixing of the marked voles, which would be rather difficult to achieve (especially as female voles can
be highly territorial).
You might be asking yourself why it was OK to find the maximum by setting pN  pN-1. This is
a standard method, but of course it only works if the distribution is one-humped, like a normal dis-
tribution. An alternative approach would have been to approximate the distributions using Stirling's
approximation, which at its most basic is

                                                       ln N !  N ln N - N .

This gives exactly the same equation as the pN  pN-1 method, and shows that the distribution is
indeed one-humped.

Problem 74: Breaking a stick  ()

A stick is broken at a point, chosen at random, along its length. Find the probability that the
ratio, R, of the length of the shorter piece to the length of the longer piece is less than r, where r
is a given positive number.
Find the probability density function for R, and calculate the mean and variance of R.

Comments

Continuous probability distributions often seem harder than discrete distributions, for no good reason:
the concepts are the same, and in fact integrals are normally easier than sums.
Here, part of the difficulty is that you have to set up the problem yourself. You have a random vari-
able with a known distribution (corresponding to the point at which the stick is broken), but you are
interested in another random variable (the ratio of lengths) derived from the first. As always, it is best
to work with the cumulative distribution functions rather than the probability density functions when
deriving the distribution of the second random variable.
166 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 74

Let the length of the stick be 2 and let X be the length of the shorter piece of stick, so that X  .
The random variable X is uniformly distributed on the interval 0  x  , so

                                                       P(0  X  x) = x .
                                                                              

                 X                    X = 2R .
Now R = 2 - X , by definition, so            1+R

The cumulative distribution function for R is given by

(                                     )(                       )
P(R  r) = P X 2 - X  r = P X  2r 1 + r = 2r (1 + r) = 2r 1 + r .

Let's check that this satisfies the conditions for a cumulative distribution function: it should increase
from 0 to 1 as r goes from its smallest value, which is 0, to its greatest value, which is 1. And it does, so
that's OK.

The probability density function is the derivative of the cumulative distribution function:

                                      ()
                                      d 2r                  2
                                                        =      2.
                                      dr 1 + r (r + 1)

Integrating to find E(R) and E(R2) gives                     2  1 2r2
                               1 2r                     0 E(R ) = (1 + r)2 dr = 3 - 4 ln 2 ,

                   0 E(R) = (1 + r)2 dr = 2 ln 2 - 1 ;

and Var (R) = (3 - 4 ln 2) - (2 ln 2 - 1)2 = 2 - 4(ln 2)2.

Post-mortem

Note the check we made to verify that the function we found for the cumulative distribution could actu-
ally be a cumulative distribution function, which is equivalent to checking that the probability density
function integrates to 1.
We should also check that the final answers make sense. Putting numbers into a calculator gives 2 ln 2 -
1 = 0.23 for the expected value, which seems reasonable; at least it is less than 1. If you sketch the
density function, you see that this could easily be its average value (do it!).
For the variance, I got 0.08, which means that the ratio is likely to be in the plausible range 0.15 to 0.31.
There are a variety of other stick-breaking problems, including a rather pleasing one about breaking the
stick in two places and finding the probability that the pieces form a triangle. In this case, it matters
how you break the stick: you could break it once and then break one of the pieces; or you could choose
two points on the stick randomly at which to break it. For an interesting discussion, see the excellent
cut-the-knot website: http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Probability/TriProbability.shtml

Comments

It is quite difficult to find statistics questions at this level that are not too difficult and are also not
simple applications of standard methods. For example, 2 tests are not really suitable, because the
theory is sophisticated while the applications are usually rather straightforward. Most questions in the
probability/statistics area tend therefore to concentrate on probability, and many of these have a bit of
pure mathematics thrown in.

Here, the random variable is the coefficient of a quadratic equation, which is rather pleasing. But you
have to handle the inequalities carefully. The difficulty is increased by the conditional element: for parts
(i) and (ii) you are only interested in the case of real roots.

If you don't have statistical tables handy, don't bother to find some: just leave the answers in terms of
the probability, (z), that a standard ( = 0,  = 1) normally distributed random variable Z satisfies
Z z.
168 Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Solution to problem 75

The solution of the quadratic is                                  
                                                   X = -B  B2 - 1

which has real roots if |B|  1. Let (z) be the probability that a standard normally distributed vari-

able Z satisfies Z  z. Then the probability that |B|  1 is (taking the two tails of the normal distribution)

                                                (              )
                                   (-1) + 1 - (1) = 2 - 2 (1) = 0.3174.

(i) We need the smaller root to be greater than 51 . The smaller root is -B - B2 - 1. Now provided


  B2 - 1 is real, we have

                             B2 - 1 > 15                       1          B2 - 1
                                                               5
                  -B -                                B     +     <  -

                                                 (B + 15 )2 > B2 - 1 and (B + 15 ) < 0

                                                 25 B + 125 > -1 and B < - 15

                                                 - 15 > B > - 135 .

However, if B < - 51 , then the condition that B2 - 1 is real, i.e. |B|  1, implies the stronger condition

B    -1.  The  condition  that  both  roots     are   real  and   greater   than       1  is  therefore
                                                                                       5

                                                      - 513 < B  -1

and  the  probability  that  both  roots   are  real  and   greater       than  1  is
                                                                                5

                       (-1) - (-2.6) = (2.6) - (1) = 0.9953 - 0.8413 = 0.1540.

The  conditional  probability   that  both  roots     are   greater  than       1  given      that  they  are  real  is
                                                                                5

                  ( 1 ) P( both roots > 51 and both roots real)                    (                      )
               P both roots > 5 both real =
                                                                                P both roots real

                                                      = 0.1540 = 0.485.

(ii) The sum of the roots is -2B, so we want the expectation of |2B| given that |B|  1, which is

Teaching Mathematics is nothing less than a mathematical manifesto. Arising in response to
a limited National Curriculum, and engaged with secondary schooling for those aged 11-14
(Key Stage 3) in particular, this handbook for teachers will help them broaden and enrich
their students' mathematical education. It avoids specifying how to teach, and focuses
instead on the central principles and concepts that need to be borne in mind by all teachers
and textbook authors but which are little appreciated in the UK at present.
This study is aimed at anyone who would like to think more deeply about the discipline
of `elementary mathematics', in England and Wales and anywhere else. By analysing and
supplementing the current curriculum, Teaching Mathematics provides food for thought for
all those involved in school mathematics, whether as aspiring teachers or as experienced
professionals. It challenges us all to reflect upon what it is that makes secondary school
mathematics educationally, culturally, and socially important.
Tony Gardiner, former Reader in Mathematics and Mathematics Education at the University of
Birmingham, was responsible for the foundation of the United Kingdom Mathematics Trust in 1996,
one of the UK's largest mathematics enrichment programs. In 1997 Gardiner served as President of
the Mathematical Association, and in 2011 was elected Education Secretary of the London Mathe-
matical Society.
Advanced Problems in Mathematics

Preparing for University

Stephen Siklos

This new and expanded edion is intended to help candidates prepare for entrance
examinaons in mathemacs and scienfic subjects, including STEP (Sixth Term Examinaon
Paper). STEP is an examinaon used by Cambridge Colleges for condional offers in
mathemacs. They are also used by some other UK universies and many mathemacs
departments recommend that their applicants pracce on the past papers even if they do
not take the examinaon.

Advanced Problems in Mathematics bridges the gap between school and university
mathemacs, and prepares students for an undergraduate mathemacs course. The
quesons analysed in this book are all based on past STEP quesons and each queson
is followed by a comment and a full soluon. The comments direct the reader's aenon
to key points and put the queson in its true mathemacal context. The soluons point
students to the methodology required to address advanced mathemacal problems crically
and independently.

This book is a must read for any student wishing to apply to scienfic subjects at university
level and for anyone interested in advanced mathemacs.

             Stephen Siklos was a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge. He worked in
             Cambridge University's Faculty of Mathematics, where his main area of research
             was Einstein's theory of general relativity and where he acted as Admissions
             Officer. He had a particular interest in the transition from school to university
             mathematics and for over thirty years presided over the STEP examinations,
used as a qualification for undergraduate admissions by some of the top UK university
mathematics departments.

As with all Open Book publicaons, this enre book is available to read for free on the
publisher's website. Printed and digital edions, together with supplementary digital material,
