      examining the inequities in achievement among ethnic groups. Dr.
      Rojas-LeBouef also assists students and faculty in their writing and
      statistical needs on the Writing and Statistical Help website.
As we stated in our first book, Calculating Basic Statistical Procedures
in SPSS: A Self-Help and Practical Guide to Preparing Theses,
Dissertations, and Manuscripts, we have observed student after student
who experienced difficulty with using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS) and with interpreting the voluminous output
generated by SPSS. These difficulties were present for basic statistical
procedures and even more noticeable for more advanced statistical
analyses. The problems students experienced in conducting these
procedures, along with statistics anxiety they experienced, led the two
of us to develop very specific and very detailed steps for students to
follow. Even with the use of these steps, we still had students who
managed to experience difficulty in being able to use SPSS successfully.
As a result, we generated screenshots for every major point-and-click
step. This combination of steps and screenshots has met with excellent
student satisfaction and, most importantly for us as instructors, has
enhanced their ability to be successful in using SPSS.

We have written this textbook to be a complement to the basic statistics
text mentioned above. We believe that using our detailed steps and
screenshots will assist readers in conducting the more complicated
analyses discussed in this text. Graduate students, especially doctoral
students, who take an advanced statistics course in which SPSS is used
will find these steps and screenshots to be very practical and very easy
to follow. Finally, faculty members who engage in scholarly activities
but are years removed from their own statistics courses will find this
textbook to be helpful. We hope that you find our materials helpful to
you in your use of SPSS and in your interpretation of SPSS output.

In this chapter, we will provide you with the steps and screenshots to
select out a single group for analysis. In this circumstance, your data
set consists of data from multiple groups. Your interest, however, is in
obtaining statistics on only one specific group. Using SPSS for all
students will only provide you with statistical information for all of the
individuals, aggregated across all of the groups. It will not give you
statistical information on a specific group. If you follow the steps and
screenshots we provide, you can have SPSS generate statistics for the
group of students in which you are interested.

This step presupposes that you have already opened up SPSS and your
data file. Click on Variable View in the data window.
Identify your grouping variable. It should be a nominal measure (see
the far right column). In the example below, Recoded Instructional
Expenditures into 3 groups, is our grouping variable.

Click on the Values cell for this grouping variable. Three dots will
appear. These three dots indicate that a screen is hidden underneath
this cell.
Clicking on the three dots will reveal the hidden screen. After clicking
on the three dots, this screen appears and shows us the names of the
three groups.
For purposes of this chapter, we will have statistics calculated for group
1 which is the Poorest Financed School Districts. Now that we know
that this group is numbered as group 1, we will cancel out of this
screen.
Click on the data view screen.
We are now at the data screen. To select out a specific group on which
to have statistics calculated, click on Data.

 Data
 Select Cases
You will note that All Cases is checked. You should click on the
 If Condition is satisfied
When you click on the If Condition is satisfied, the If button then
becomes activated.

 Click on the If, under the If Condition is satisfied.
Clicking on the If opens up this screen. We will have to send over the
name of the grouping variable, Recoded Instructional Expenditures
into 3 groups.
 Click on the Recoded Instructional Expenditures into 3 groups
variable and then on the right arrow key.
Now the grouping variable has been placed into the empty rectangle,
we can now begin the process of selecting the specific group of interest.

 Click on the = sign
After clicking on the = sign, it appears to the right of the grouping
variable in the rectangle.

 Click on the number of the group on which you want to calculate
statistics. In our case, we want to use group # 1 (remember our
previous steps in identifying the Poorest Financed School Districts.

In this case we will click on 1.
We have now informed SPSS that we want to select out only those
Poorest Financed School Districts for statistical analyses.
 Click on Continue above.
 After clicking on continue, this screen appears.
 Click on OK.
You will now be sent to your output file. Click on the data file and data
view.

In the data view screen, you will note that the Moderately Financed
School Districts and the Best Financed School Districts have been
marked through. The only active cases on which SPSS will calculate
statistics are the Poorest Financed School Districts (group = 1).
At this point, you can calculate descriptive statistics or other analyses.
Such calculations will only have the Poorest Financed School Districts
in them.

After obtaining the calculations of interest for this group, if you wish to
select the Best Financed School Districts, you would follow the steps
above in selecting group 1. Replace group = 1, with group = 2.

If you intend to analyze all cases (i.e., have all three groups back
together), follow these steps.

 Click on Data

 Click on Select Cases
After clicking on Select Cases, this screen will appear.
 Click on All Cases
 Click on OK above.

You will now note that no cases are crossed through. SPSS will now use
all three groups in its analyses.

These procedures are to be followed when your data are already
entered into SPSS and when you have values that you need to either
remove or to recode into different values.

Work from the Data View window.
After clicking on the Data View button, your screen should look like the
screen below in that you are looking at data.
Identify the variable in which values are present that you want to
recode.

In our case, we want to recode the values for Question One below.
Identify the values within this variable that you wish to recode. You
may need to run the frequencies procedure to list out all of the values
present for the variable of interest.

 Click on Analyze

 Click on Descriptive Statistics

 Click on Frequencies
Highlight the variable on which you will request frequencies so that
you can then determine the values that you will need to change/recode.
In this example, we are using Survey Question One.
 Click on the arrow in the middle to send over the Survey Question
One variable.
Because we want a listing of the values present for this variable, Survey
Question One, we will click on OK.

Go to the output screen. For this example, our output looks like the
following. Survey Question One has five different values (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4,
5). The value of 1 only occurred 6 times. These values could represent a
5-point Likert format of 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 =
Neutral/Undecided, 4 = Agree, and 5 = Strongly Agree. [Note. Readers
are referred to a separate chapter on typing in survey data with
appropriate labeling.]
Based upon our frequencies, we will combine values 1 and 2 into a
Disagreement category and 4 and 5 into an Agreement category.

 Click on Transform.
You now have an option to Recode Into Same Variables or Recode Into
Different Variables. We recommend that you recode into different
variables so that the data present in the variable of Question One is left
untouched.
When you click on Recode Into Different Variables, you will then see
this screen.
Highlight the variable on which you will be recoding the values. In this
example, our variable is Survey Question One. After highlighting it,
click on the arrow to send it to the Input Variable - Output Variable
box.
Click under the Output Variable where Name is present.
Now type in a new name for the variable you will be creating.
Remember that the information in Survey Question One is being
recoded from 5 separate values into 3 values. We encourage you to type
Recoded in front of the new variable name.

The name, RecodedQuestionOne, will be the name of our new variable.
After typing in the name, click on Change.
After clicking on Change, the name for the new variable that is being
created appears in the Numeric Variable - Output Variable box.
Now click on Old and New Values. This is where the values will be
recoded.
This screen will then appear.
Click on Old Value and the rectangle underneath it becomes activated.
Now we will begin recoding the values for this variable. Type a 1 in the
Old Value box and a 1 in the New Value box.
Click on Add. This then moves the 1 in the Old Value and 1 in the New
Value into the larger box.
Now type a 2 in Old Value and a 1 in New Value. When this process is
completed, SPSS will merge all values of a 1 and all values of a 2 into a
1 category.
Click on Add. The Old Value of 2 and the New Value of 1 now appear
in the larger box.
Type a 3 in Old Value and a 2 in New Value.
Click on Add. The Old Value of 3 and the New Value of 2 have been
added into the larger box.
Type a 4 in Old Value and a 3 in New Value. Then click on Add
The Old Value of 4 and the New Value of 3 have now been added to the
larger box.
Finally, type 5 in the Old Value box and 3 into the New Value box. Click
on Add
Now all 5 values in the Survey Question One variable are present in the
Old - New box below. They will be recoded into 3 values.
Click on Continue.
Click on OK. SPSS will then generate a new variable for you,
RecodedQuestionOne.
The newly created variable, RecodedQuestionOne, will be added as the
last variable in your dataset.
You have generated a new variable, one not in your original dataset,
that contains 3 values, instead of the 5 values in the Question One
variable.

These procedures are to be followed when you have data already
entered into an Excel file. In this chapter, you will be provided with
steps and screenshots on how to convert the data from an Excel file into
an SPSS data file. Open up your SPSS program and this screen will
appear. Click on Cancel.

Your screen will now look like this.
The Excel file we will be converting for this example looks like the
following:
In this excel file are three variables: AveragedWritingScore, Gone, and
Gtwo. All three are numeric variables. The first row contains the
variable names. Rows 2 through 14 contain the data for the variables.

Prior to the next steps, make sure that the Excel file that you intend to
convert into SPSS is not open. If it is open and in use, SPSS will not be
able to convert the file.

Once you are back in the SPSS data view window,

 Click on File

 Click on Open

 Click on Data
A screen similar to the one below will open up on your computer. You
need to locate where your Excel file is located. First, you will need to
change the Files of type below.
Change from SPSS statistics (*.sav) to Excel (*.xls). Then find where
the file is located and its name.
In the case of this example, the Excel file was located on the Desktop
and is titled, Practice Excel File.xls. Then click on Open.
After clicking on open, the screen below will appear. For an Excel file
to be converted properly into SPSS, the first row in the Excel file
should be the names of the variables. All of the other rows in the Excel
file should be the data. If you use more than one row to describe your
variables, you will not be able to convert your Excel file into SPSS
using these steps.

Once this screen has appeared, click on OK.
You should then be sent to the Output window.
Click on the SPSS data button below to get back to your SPSS screen.
Clicking on the SPSS data icon as depicted above should take you to
the Data View screen. In this case, three variables were in the Excel
data file: AveragedWritingScore, Gone, and Gtwo. These three
variables were directly converted from the Excel file into a SPSS
datafile.
Now we need to make sure that the variables are correctly identified
and labeled in this SPSS dataset. Click on Variable View.
In the case of our example, the screen looks like the following:
All three of the variables have been correctly identified as numeric. The
number of decimals needs to be increased to 2, not 1 as shown above.

To change the number of decimal places from 1 to 2, click on one of the
decimal cells. In the screen below, the decimal cell for the first row has
been clicked on. Once clicked an up and a down arrow will appear.
We need to increase the number of decimal places so we will click on
the up arrow.

Clicking one time on the up arrow will change the number of decimals
from 1 to 2.

Now we will do the same for row 2 and for row 3.
Viewing the screen below will show you that all three variables now
have 2 decimal places.
Prior to conducting any statistical analyses, we recommend that you
type in identifying information in the Label column for each variable.
The information you type in the Label column will be the information
printed out in the SPSS output and will make it easier to interpret.
We have converted our Excel file into a SPSS dataset. Please save it
prior to conducting any statistical analyses.

 Click on File

 Click on Save

Give it a name of your choosing and save it in a location that you will
remember later.

      Rojas-LeBouef also assists students and faculty in their writing and
      statistical needs on the Writing and Statistical Help website.
In this chapter, we will show you how to enter data from a survey into
SPSS. You can either develop your SPSS data file straight from your
survey and then enter in data once your surveys have been completed.
Or, you can develop your SPSS data file from your completed surveys.
In this set of steps and screenshots, we will assume that you have
completed surveys on hand. In our example, we will use the following
survey:

You will note that this survey consists of five items, with a 4-point
Likert format. We have assigned a value of 1 to Strongly Agree; a value
of 2 to Agree; a value of 3 to Disagree; and a value of 4 to Strongly
Disagree. You could, of course, reverse these values so that Strongly
Disagree could be a 1.
Open up your SPSS so that you have a blank data screen in front of
you. Click on the Variable View button at the bottom left of your
screen.
We are now at the screen where we can enter in variable names for our
survey items. For simplicity, we will refer to the first Survey Item as
S1; the second Survey Item as S2; and so on. We will click in the first
cell, row one, under Name.
Doing this permits us to type in S1 for our first Survey Item.
After typing in S1, then move your cursor to the column that reads
Label. Once you have typed in S1 and moved your cursor out of that
cell, SPSS will fill in the default values for that variable. This variable
is a numeric one. In the column marked Label, we will place in the
survey item from the Word file.
If you have the survey in Word format, have your Word file opened
and copy the first survey item.
Go back to your SPSS datafile and paste the copied survey item in the
Label column, first row.
Repeat this process for S2.
Go to your Word file and copy the second survey item.
Paste it in the Label column for the second row.
You would repeat the same process for the remaining survey items.
After this work, your file would look like the following.
Now we need to type in the values for the 4-point Likert scale. To do so,
click on the first cell in row one under the column heading, Values. See
the arrow below.
When you click in this cell, three dots appear. These three dots indicate
that a screen is hidden beneath this one. Click on the three dots.
After clicking on the three dots, the following screen will appear.
In this screen, we will type in a numeric value in the Value cell and the
Likert-format response label in the Label cell. That is, our four values
are 1, 2, 3, and 4, which correspond to a Strongly Agree, Agree,
Disagree, and Strongly Disagree. Refer back to the survey which we are
using for this example.
After typing in a 1 in Value and Strongly Agree in Label, we will now
click on Add.
After clicking on Add, your screen should look like the one below.
We will repeat this process for 2 Agree; 3 Disagree; and 4 Strongly
Disagree. Your screen should look like the one below.
Now click on OK.
Your screen should now look like the following one. The 4-point Likert
scale has been successfully entered for the first survey item. Now we
will copy it and paste it one at a time for the other four survey items.
Right mouse click on the cell that you just completed.
Copy.
Move to the second cell in the Label column.
Paste.
Your screen will now have that cell filled in with the same information
that you typed in for survey item one. Repeat this paste process for
survey items 3, 4, and 5.
Your screen will now look like the following one. All of your survey
items are present and typed out in the Label column. All of the numeric
values for participants' responses are labeled in the Values column.
Remember to save your file.
You have now successfully created a SPSS dataset for your survey.

In this set of steps and screenshots, you will be presented with
information regarding how to determine the internal consistency (i.e.,
reliability) of scores derived from a larger set of variables. In
particular, this chapter follows up on the factor analysis chapter. The
subscales that were determined to constitute Factor 1 and the subscales
that were determined to comprise Factor 2 will be the variables used in
this chapter to ascertain the extent to which they constitute internally
consistent factors. For more detailed information regarding internal
consistency analysis, readers are referred to the Hyperstats Online

Conducting an internal consistency analysis is usually part of a set of
statistical analyses. Its purpose is to determine score reliability and not
to determine whether groups differ on some variable. As such, internal
consistency analysis precedes the use of inferential statistical
procedures.

Have your data set pulled into SPSS-PC. In this data set, we have the
same 10 subscales used in the factor analysis chapter.
Click on Analyze
Click on Scale
Click on Reliability Analysis
Using the information from the chapter on factor analysis, we want to
determ ine the internal consistency of: Verbal 1 (Information), Verbal 2
(Similarities), Verbal 3 (Arithmetic), Verbal 4 (Vocabulary), and Verbal
5 (Comprehension). Click on each of these variables and send each to
the box labeled Items.
Now your screen should look like the one below.
Click on Statistics.
After clicking on Statistics, the following screen should appear.
Click under Descriptives on
Item
Scale
Scale if item deleted
After you have clicked on the three items under Descriptives, next click
under Summaries on

Means

Variances
Now that you have clicked on Means and Variances under Summaries,
your screen should now look like the screen below. Next, under Inter-
Item, click on

Correlations
After you check to verify that your screen looks the one below, then you
may click on Continue.
Next click on OK.
SPSS should send you to the Output screen. If not, click on the Output
icon at the bottom of your screen.

      examining the inequities in achievement among ethnic groups. Dr.
      Rojas-LeBouef also assists students and faculty in their writing and
      statistical needs on the Writing and Statistical Help website.

Now that you are in the SPSS output screen, your screen should
resemble the following one.
The first table, labeled Case Processing Summary, indicates how many
cases were in the analysis. In this example, 1,136 cases out of the total
sample of 1,182 were used in the analysis.

The next table titled Reliability Statistics indicates the score reliability
for these five Verbal subscales. The Cronbach's Coefficient Alpa is .872
for these five Verbal subscales.
The table, labeled as Item Statistics, below the Reliability Statistics
table contains the descriptive statistics for these five Verbal subscales
for all participants in the sample. This information may be helpful in
your Results section.
The next table of importance is the one labeled Item-Total Statistics.
The far right column of this table, Cronbach's Alpha if Item Deleted,
indicates how much of a change in internal consistency will occur if you
delete that variable from the group. As our Cronbach's Coefficient
Alpha for all 5 Verbal subscales was .872, as previously noted, no
increase occurs in the internal consistency if any of the 5 Verbal
subscales are deleted.
The next column in this table that we examine is the one labeled
Corrected Item-Total Correlation. These values indicate the extent to
which each variable is related with the group of variables, in this case
with the total of the Verbal subscales. The higher the correlation, the
more that item/variable is associated with the total of the group. The
values in this column reflect that these five Verbal subscales are
consistently contributing to the measurement of the same/similar
construct.
In the case of the five Verbal subscales, all five subscales may be
regarded as providing internally consistent scores. Moreover, their
scores can be aggregated or added together to create a composite score.
See our chapter on data transformation - creating a new variable.

Now that we have determined the internal consistency of the Verbal
subscales, we will ascertain the extent to which the Performance
subscales are internally consistent.

From the data window, click on Analyze
After clicking on Analyze,
Click on Scale.
Click on Reliability Analysis.
Because this reliability analysis is the second one you are conducting,
the screen shows the five Verbal subtests included in the first analysis.
Remove these from the Items box.
Your screen will now look like the following one. Now we will
determine the internal consistency of the Performance subscales. From
the factor analysis chapter, Performance 2 was determined to not be
part of this cluster or group of subscales. Therefore, we will place only
Performance 1 (Picture Completion), Performance 3 (Picture
Arrangement), Performance 4 (Block Design), and Performance 5
(Object Assembly) in the Items box.

Once the four Performance subscales have been sent to the Items box,
your screen would look like the following one:

Next, click on Statistics.
You will note that all of the items you had clicked on when conducting
the previous internal consistency analysis remain active.

Click on Continue.
Click on OK and this internal consistency analysis will be conducted.
SPSS should place you in the Output window. If not, click on the
Output screen icon at the bottom of your screen.
In the output screen, the first table you will see is the Case Processing
Summary. In this example, 1,139 cases were used out of the total
sample of 1,182 cases.
The overall internal consistency of the scores of these four Performance
subscales is located in the Reliability Statistics table. In this example,
Cronbach's Coefficient Alpha is .800.
The next table labeled Item Statistics contains the descriptive statistics
for these four Performance subscales for the sample of 1,139 persons.
In the next table of importance, labeled Item-Total Statistics, locate the
far right column of this table. This column, titled as Cronbach's Alpha
if Item Deleted, indicates how much of a change in internal consistency
would occur if you deleted that variable from the group. As our
Cronbach's Coefficient Alpha for all four Performance subscales was
.800, as previously noted, no increase occurs in the internal consistency
if any of these subscales are deleted.
The next column in this table that we examine is the one labeled
Corrected Item-Total Correlation. These values indicate the extent to
which each variable is related with the group of variables, in this case
with the total of the Performance subscales. The higher the correlation,
the more that item/variable is associated with the total of the group.
The values in this column reflect that these four Performance subscales

In the case of the four Performance subscales, all four subscales may be
regarded as providing internally consistent scores. Moreover, their
scores can be aggregated or added together to create a composite score.
See our chapter on data transformation - creating a new variable.

Now that we have determined the internal consistency of the scores
from the Verbal subscales and of the scores from the Performance
subscales, a name needs to be assigned to each of these two factors.
Naming the factor involves interpreting the pattern/structure
coefficients from the factor analysis that was described in the factor
analysis chapter. All significant pattern/structure coefficients are
typically used in the interpretation process. Variables with higher
coefficients influence to a greater extent the name or label selected to
represent a factor. Naming of factors is NOT very scientific and is
based on the subjective opinion of the analyst---naming is open to
criticism.

In this set of steps, readers will conduct a factor analysis procedure, in
particular, a Varimax factor analysis. For detailed information
regarding the assumptions underlying use of a factor analysis and
reasons for using a Varimax factor analysis, readers are referred to the
Hyperstats Online Statistics Textbook at
http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/ ; to the Electronic Statistics Textbook

Research questions for which a factor analysis procedure is
appropriate involve analyzing a survey or an instrument in which
multiple scores are present. For example, if a 100-item survey is
administered, it is not feasible nor is it desirable to conduct 100
separate t-tests or to calculate all of the possible intercorrelations.
Rather, the 100 items on the survey should be collapsed or aggregated
in some manner. Use of a factor analysis permits the clustering of items
into coherent and logical clusters which can then be analyzed through
use of multivariate statistical procedures. As such, factor analysis
procedures do not directly answer inferential research questions.
Instead they serve as precursors to other statistical methods.

For this particular chapter, we will conduct a factor analysis of the 10
subscales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third
Edition. The 10 subscales are shown below: Picture Completion (pc),
Information (inf), Coding (cod), Similarities (sim), Picture
Arrangement (pa), Arithmetic (ari), Block Design (bd), Vocabulary
(voc), Object Assembly (oa), and Comprehension (comp). Prior to
conducting a factor analysis, you should have verified the accuracy of
your data.
In this example, we will click on
Analyze
Dimension Reduction
Factor
After clicking on factor, the following screen will appear. The variables
on which you want a factor analysis conducted should be sent into the
box titled Variables. In our example, we will send all 10 of the subscales
into the Variables box.
Once all of the subscales on which you want the factor analysis
conducted have been placed into the Variables box, click on Rotation.
After clicking on Rotation, the following screen will appear. Under
Method, the box for None is already checked because it is the SPSS
default value. We will conduct a Varimax factor analysis. Click on
Varimax.
Varimax has been clicked below. Click on Continue.
The screen below will appear after you have clicked on Continue.
Now click on Descriptives.
Your screen should now look like the one below. Click on Univariate
Descriptives.

Unclick Initial Solution.
Your screen will now look like the following screenshot.
Click on Continue.
The following screen should now be present.
Click on Extraction.

After clicking on Extraction, the following screen should now be
present.

Under Display, click on Screen plot.
Unclick the Unrotated factor solution.
Click on Continue.
After clicking on Continue, the screen below should be present.
Now click on OK.
You should now have factor analysis results. If SPSS does not send you
to your output screen, click on the Output icon at the bottom of your
screen.
In your SPSS Output screen, the first table of importance is the
Descriptive Statistics table. The sample size (n), M, and SD for each of
the 10 subscales used in the factor analysis are present in this table.
Underneath the Descriptive Statistics table is the Scree plot. What the
scree plot does is to plot the eigenvalue against the factor number
(Cattell, 1966; Zwick & Velicer, 1986). The eigenvalue and factor
number are present in the table labeled Total Variance Explained. You
will note in the Scree Plot below that the line is essentially flat after the
second factor. This plot below depicts the presence of two possible
factors, 1 and 2.
In the Total Variance Explained table, statistical information that is
depicted in the Scree Plot is presented. The column labeled Total
reflects the eigenvalues for the two factors. To determine the number of
factors you may have: look at the eigenvalue column. All factors with
values less than 1 are considered to be statistically insignificant and are
disregarded (Kaiser, 1958). Thus, an eigenvalue of at least 1.0 must be
present for a factor to be possible. In the Total Variance Explained
table below, two factors are present with eigenvalues greater than 1.00:
Factor 1 has an eigenvalue of 3.545 and Factor 3 has an eigenvalue of
2.515.
After checking the eigenvalues to ensure that they are greater than one
(Kaiser, 1958), the percent of variance must be examined. To constitute
a viable factor, the factor should account for at least 5 percent of the
variance to be used. In the example below, Factor 1 accounts for
35.45% of the variance and Factor 2 explains 25.15% of the variance.
In both cases, the factors account for much more than the minimum
5%. Together these two factors account for 60.60% of the variance.
Next we will examine the Rotated Component Matrix. This table
contains the factor loadings or pattern/structure coefficients for the 10
subscales analyzed in this Varimax procedure. To determine whether a
subscale is a component of a specific factor, a cutoff value of .3
(Lambert & Durand, 1975) is recommended as an acceptable minimum
value for pattern/structure coefficients. In this example, Verbal 1
(Information) has a pattern/structure coefficient of .782; Verbal 1
(Similarities) of .745; Verbal 3 (Arithmetic) of .661; Verbal 4
(Vocabulary) of .845; and Verbal 5 (Comprehension) of .797. Though
above the cutoff of .3, Performance 2 (Coding), Performance 3 (Picture
Arrangement), and Performance 4 (Block Design) are well below the
coefficients for the Verbal subscales.
For Factor 2, the pattern/structure coefficients were .711 for
Performance 1 (Picture Completion); .536 for Performance 3 (Picture
Arrangement); .767 for Performance 4 (Block Design); and .865 for
Performance 5 (Object Assembly). Two of the Verbal subscales were at
or above the cutoff value of .3, however, their pattern/structure
coefficients were markedly lower than the ones for the four
Performance subscales mentioned above.
In this example, it appears that the Performance 2 (Coding) subscale is
not part of Factor 2. It may be a component of Factor 1.
You have now conducted a Varimax factor rotation of the 10 subscales
of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition. To
determine whether your factors are internally consistent, you would
need to perform an internal consistency analysis for the subscales that
constitute Factor 1 and a separate internal consistency analysis for the
subscales that constitute Factor 2. See our chapter on steps and
screenshots for conducting internal consistency analyses.

In this set of steps, readers will calculate a multivariate analysis of
variance procedure, following the determination of the extent to which
data for the dependent variables reflect normal distributions. Although
a parametric statistical procedure requires that its data be reflective of
a normal curve, the multivariate analysis of variance procedure is
regarded as being sufficiently robust that it can withstand most
violations. For detailed information regarding the assumptions
underlying the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
procedure, readers are referred to the Hyperstats Online Statistics
Textbook at http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/ ; to the Electronic
Statistics Textbook (2011) at http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/ ; or to

s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1304967862&sr=1-1

Research questions for which a MANOVA procedure is appropriate
involve asking for differences in multiple dependent variables by group
membership (i.e., more than two groups may be present). In addition to
multiple dependent variables being present, multiple independent
variables can be present as well. That is, differences in several
achievement variables could be analyzed by student gender, student
ethnicity, student socioeconomic status, and the like. A specific research
question that could be addressed is, "What is the difference in
academic achievement among elementary school students as a function
of ethnic membership, gender, and grade level?" Academic
achievement in this example could be reading, math, science, and social
studies scores. The independent variables are ethnicity, gender, and
grade level.

For this particular chapter, the research question on which we will
conduct a MANOVA will be: What is the difference in verbal aptitude
among elementary reading groups? Verbal aptitude consists of Verbal 1
(inf), Verbal 2 (sim), Verbal 3 (ari), and Verbal 4 (voc).
In this example, our independent or grouping variable is elementary
reading group.
By clicking on variable view, you can see how many groups of students
are present in the reading group variable; the names of the groups; and
the numbers which have been assigned to each group.
After clicking on Variable View, the following screen will appear:
Arrows have been placed toward the name of the independent or
grouping variable; toward the label assigned to this variable; and then
toward the values of each group.
Now click on the cell for Reading Group Membership. Three dots will
appear, indicating that another screen is beneath this one.
Click on the three dots shown in the screen above and the value and
name of each of the reading groups will be shown. Our three groups are
Excellent Reader (1), Good Reader (2), and Extremely Poor Reader (3).
Now that you know what your independent (grouping) variable is and
your dependent variables are, it is time to determine the extent to
which the dependent variable data are normally distributed. Cancel
out of the screen above. Then click on data view.
Your screen should now look like the one below.
Check for Skewness and Kurtosis values falling within/without the
parameters of normality (-3 to +3). To do so, you need to obtain these
values for each of your three groups for each of your four dependent
variables.

 Split your file on the basis on your independent variable/fixed
factor/grouping variable. To do so, click on the icon next to the scales.
Holding your cursor on it will reveal Split File, as shown below.
After clicking on the split file icon, the following screen will appear:
You will note that the Analyze all cases, do not create groups is
checked. This value is the default for SPSS as all cases are analyzed,
unless otherwise specified. To obtain measures of normality for each of
the three reading groups, the Compare groups button will need to be
clicked.
The screen below will appear after the Compare groups button has
been clicked. Note that the Groups Based on rectangle has now become
active. The independent (grouping) variable should be highlighted, as it
already is, and then moved to the Groups Based on cell. After
highlighting the Reading Group Membership variable, then click on
the arrow below.
After clicking on the arrow, your independent variable of Reading
Group Membership is now in the Groups Based on cell. Now click on
OK.
Now all SPSS analyses will be calculated separately for each of the
three reading groups.
 Analyze
* Descriptive Statistics
* Frequencies
After clicking on frequencies, the following screen should now be
present. Remember that the dependent variables in this example are
Verbal 1 through Verbal 4 (i.e., inf, ari, voc)
 Move over the dependent variables. In this example, highlight each of
the dependent variables one at a time and click on the right arrow.
When all four dependent variables are in the Variable cell, then click
on Statistics.
After clicking on statistics, the screen below will appear. Note that no
statistics items are checked. For purposes of this example, only the
skewness and kurtosis items will be checked. Although readers may
obtain descriptive statistics at this screen, the MANOVA procedure
itself can be used to obtain that information.
Though previously discussed in the steps and screenshots chapters for
the basic statistical procedures, readers may find the following
information helpful in understanding skewness and kurtosis and their
importance for conducting statistical procedures.

* Skewness [Note. Skewness refers to the extent to which the data are
normally distributed around the mean. Skewed data involve having
either mostly high scores with a few low ones or having mostly low
scores with a few high ones.] Readers are referred to the following
sources for a more detailed definition of skewness:
http://www.statistics.com/index.php?page=glossary&term_id=356 and
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/basic-
statistics/#Descriptive%20statisticsb

To standardize the skewness value so that its value can be constant
across datasets and across studies, the following calculation must be
made: Take the skewness value from the SPSS output and divide it by
the Std. error of skewness. If the resulting calculation is within -3 to +3,
then the skewness of the dataset is within the range of normality
(Onwuegbuzie & Daniel, 2002). If the resulting calculation is outside of
this +/-3 range, the dataset is not normally distributed.

* Kurtosis [Note. Kurtosis also refers to the extent to which the data
are normally distributed around the mean. This time, the data are piled
up higher than normal around the mean or piled up higher than
normal at the ends of the distribution.] Readers are referred to the
following sources for a more detailed definition of kurtosis:
http://www.statistics.com/index.php?page=glossary&term_id=326 and
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/basic-
statistics/#Descriptive%20statisticsb

To standardize the kurtosis value so that its value can be constant
across datasets and across studies, the following calculation must be
made: Take the kurtosis value from the SPSS output and divide it by
the Std. error of kurtosis. If the resulting calculation is within -3 to +3,
then the kurtosis of the dataset is within the range of normality
(Onwuegbuzie & Daniel, 2002). If the resulting calculation is outside of
this +/-3 range, the dataset is not normally distributed. Then the
kurtosis of the dataset is within the range of normality (Onwuegbuzie
& Daniel, 2002). If the resulting calculation is outside of this +/-3 range,
the dataset is not normally distributed.

Click on Skewness, Kurtosis, and Continue
Now click on OK.
If SPSS does not send you to the Output screen, click on the Output
button at the bottom of your screen so that you can view the results of
the statistics you just had SPSS calculate for you.
Clicking on the Output icon will result in the screen below being
present. You will note that the Statistics table below contains statistics
for the Excellent Reader group; for the Good Reader group; and for
the Extremely Poor Reader group.
In the columns to the right of the three reading groups are the skewness
and kurtosis values for the four dependent variables.
Using the skewness and kurtosis value for each dependent variable
above for each of the three groups above, type them in one at a time
into the standardized coefficients calculator. To be regarded as being
normally distributed, the coefficient should be within -3 to +3
(Onwuegbuzie & Daniel, 2002).
After calculating the standardized coefficients, record the number that

After clicking on Multivariate, the following screen will appear. You
will send your dependent variables to the Dependent Variables box and
your independent variable to the Fixed Factor box. Remember that in
this example, Verbal 1 through Verbal 4 (i.e., Information, Similarities,
Arithmetic, and Vocabulary) constitute the dependent variables and
Reading Group Membership is the independent variable.
Now send the four dependent variables (i.e., Verbal 1 through Verbal 4)
over one at a time to the Dependent Variables screen.
Then send over the independent variable, Reading Group Membership,
to the Fixed Factor box. Then click on Options.
Clicking on options will then give you this screen.

We will use this screen to obtain descriptive statistics of our four
dependent variables for each of our three reading groups; to obtain
effect size estimates; and to determine the extent to which the
assumptions underlying use of the MANOVA procedure are met.

Now that you are in the SPSS output screen, your screen should look
like the following: Your first table is titled Between-Subjects Factors
and it is entirely redundant with the table immediately below it. The
column of n in the Between-Subjects Factors table is duplicated in the
Descriptive Statistics table. Therefore, we will not use the Between-
Subjects Factors table.

Focusing on the Descriptive Statistics table will show you a column for
the M, for the SD, and for the sample size, n. This information has been
provided to you for each of the four dependent variables for each of the
three groups. This information will be used in your Results section and
should be kept.
Underneath the Descriptive Statistics table is the Box's Test of Equality
of Covariance Matrices. The information in this box involves checking
one of the assumptions underlying use of a MANOVA procedure. The
Sig. value in this box should be greater than .05 if the assumption is
met. In the example below, the Sig. value is .234 which means that this
particular assumption has been met. Readers should be informed
whether the Box's M assumption was met or was violated. See Field
(2010) for a detailed explanation of Box's M and the use of a
MANOVA, even when this assumption is violated.
Underneath the Box's Test of Equality of Covariance Matrices is the
Multivariate Tests table. This table is important because it indicates
whether or not a statistically significant difference is present among the
reading groups (i.e., our independent variable) in the aggregated
dependent variable (i.e., aggregated Verbal 1 through Verbal 4). For
our purposes, we will use Wilks' Lambda to determine whether or not
a difference is present. In this example, a statistically significant
difference is present.
Next, the Levene's Test of Equality of Error Variances table is
examined. This table involves checking the assumption that the
variability is consistent within each dependent variable for each cell in
the research design. The Sig. value in each row must be greater than
.05 for each assumption to be met. In the table below, the assumption of
equality of error variances is met for all four dependent variables as
the Sig. values range from .249 to .651. Readers should be informed
that this assumption for each dependent variable was met or was not
met. See Field (2010) for a detailed discussion regarding Levene's Test
and the robustness of MANOVA, even when this assumption is violated.
Underneath the Levene's Test of Equality table is the Tests of Between-
Subjects Effects table. Contained in this table are the univariate
ANOVAs regarding whether the reading groups differ on each of the
four dependent variables. The Wilks' Lambda simply indicated
whether an overall difference across the aggregated dependent
variables was present. It did not provide information on whether the
difference was for one, two, three, or all four of the dependent
variables.
Find the row section that begins with the name of the independent
variable. In our case, the independent variable is labeled group. Each
row in this group section is a separate analysis of variance result.
Examining the Sig. column for our four rows shows that each
univariate ANOVA yielded a statistically significant result.
These results may be interpreted to mean that a statistically significant
difference was present for Verbal 1, for Verbal 1, for Verbal 3, and for
Verbal 4 as a function of the reading group. The effect size information
for each statistically significant difference is present in the last column,
the one labeled Partial Eta Squared. Partial eta squared, or n2, is the
effect size metric provided to you in the SPSS output. To interpret
whether it is small, moderate, or large, see Cohen (1988).
Because a statistically significant difference is present for each
dependent variable, post hoc procedures must be examined to
determine if all groups differ from each other or if only some of the
groups differ. Post hoc procedure information is provided in the
Multiple Comparisons table. The arrow below is pointed toward the
specific type of post hoc we requested.
The most important column in this post hoc table is the Sig. column.
For a pairwise comparison to be statistically significant, the Sig. value
must be .05 or below. In the example below for the Verbal 1 set of
comparisons, Excellent Readers did not differ from Good Readers,
however, Excellent readers did differ from Extremely Poor Readers.
Readers should note that only three pairwise comparisons are unique
in the table for each dependent variable. SPSS, however, provides
information on six pairwise comparisons. When three groups are
present, as they are in this example, row 1, row 2, and row 4 are
unique. Row 1 is Excellent Reader compared to Good Reader. Row 2 is
Excellent Reader compared to Extremely Poor Reader. Row 4 is Good
Reader compared to Extremely Poor Reader.
Each of the four dependent variables in this example have post hoc
procedures calculated for them and are present in the table above.

All of the useful information present in the SPSS output for the
MANOVA procedure has now been covered.

In this set of steps, readers will learn how to conduct a canonical
discriminant analysis procedure. For detailed information regarding
the assumptions underlying use of a discriminant analysis, readers are
referred to the Hyperstats Online Statistics Textbook at
http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/ ; to the Electronic Statistics Textbook
(2011) at http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/ ; or to Andy Field's (2009)

Method/dp/1847879071/ref=sr_1_1?
s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1304967862&sr=1-1

Research questions for which a discriminant analysis procedure is
appropriate involve determining variables that predict group
membership. For example, if two groups of persons are present such as
completers and non-completers and archival data are available, then a
discriminant analysis procedure could be utilized. Such a procedure
could identify specific variables that differentiate group membership.
As such, interventions could be developed and targeted toward the
variables that predicted group membership. Other sample research
questions for which a discriminant analysis might be appropriate: (a)
What factors differentiates successful from unsuccessful students?; (b)
What factors differentiate delinquents from nondelinquents?; (c) What
set of test scores best differentiates students with LD, students who are
failing, and students with MR?; and (d) What set of factors
differentiates drop-outs from persisters?

For purposes of this chapter, our research question is: "What scholastic
variables differentiate boys from girls?"

First, open up the dataset you intend to analyze for your canonical
discriminant analysis.
Our independent variable is gender. Boys are labeled as group 1 and
girls are labeled as group 2.
Our dependent variables, the ones we will use to differentiate boys
from girls are 10 subscales from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children-Third Edition: Picture Completion (pc), Information (inf),
Coding (cod), Similarities (sim), Picture Arrangement (pa), Arithmetic
(ari), Block Design (bd), Vocabulary (voc), Object Assembly (oa), and
Comprehension (comp).
In the previous screenshots, we were in the variable view screen. Click
on data view, shown below, so that your screen looks like the one below.
Prior to conducting a canonical discriminant function, we need to
check the assumptions that underlie its use.

Normal Distribution

It is assumed that the data (for the variables) represent a sample from a
multivariate normal distribution. You can examine whether or not
variables are normally distributed with histograms of frequency
distributions. However, note that violations of the normality
assumption are usually not "fatal," meaning, that the resultant
significance tests etc. are still "trustworthy." You may use specific tests
for normality in addition to graphs.
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/discriminant-function-
analysis/#assumptions
We recommend that you calculate the standardized skewness
coefficients and the standardized kurtosis coefficients, as discussed in
other chapters.

* Skewness [Note. Skewness refers to the extent to which the data are
normally distributed around the mean. Skewed data involve having
either mostly high scores with a few low ones or having mostly low
scores with a few high ones.] Readers are referred to the following
sources for a more detailed definition of skewness:
http://www.statistics.com/index.php?page=glossary&term_id=356 and
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/basic-
statistics/#Descriptive%20statisticsb

To standardize the skewness value so that its value can be constant
across datasets and across studies, the following calculation must be
made: Take the skewness value from the SPSS output and divide it by
the Std. error of skewness. If the resulting calculation is within -3 to +3,
then the skewness of the dataset is within the range of normality
(Onwuegbuzie & Daniel, 2002). If the resulting calculation is outside of
this +/-3 range, the dataset is not normally distributed.

* Kurtosis [Note. Kurtosis also refers to the extent to which the data
are normally distributed around the mean. This time, the data are piled
up higher than normal around the mean or piled up higher than
normal at the ends of the distribution.] Readers are referred to the
following sources for a more detailed definition of kurtosis:
http://www.statistics.com/index.php?page=glossary&term_id=326 and
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/basic-
statistics/#Descriptive%20statisticsb

To standardize the kurtosis value so that its value can be constant
across datasets and across studies, the following calculation must be
made: Take the kurtosis value from the SPSS output and divide it by
the Std. error of kurtosis. If the resulting calculation is within -3 to +3,
then the kurtosis of the dataset is within the range of normality
(Onwuegbuzie & Daniel, 2002). If the resulting calculation is outside of
this +/-3 range, the dataset is not normally distributed.
Homogeneity of Variances/Covariances

It is assumed that the variance/covariance matrices of variables are
homogeneous across groups. Again, minor deviations are not that
important. http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/discriminant-function-
analysis/#assumptions

Correlations between Means and Variances

The major "real" threat to the validity of significance tests occurs
when the means for variables across groups are correlated with the
variances (or standard deviations). Intuitively, if there is large
variability in a group with particularly high means on some variables,
then those high means are not reliable. However, the overall
significance tests are based on pooled variances, that is, the average
variance across all groups. Thus, the significance tests of the relatively
larger means (with the large variances) would be based on the
relatively smaller pooled variances, resulting erroneously in statistical
significance. In practice, this pattern may occur if one group in the
study contains a few extreme outliers, who have a large impact on the
means, and also increase the variability. To guard against this problem,
inspect the descriptive statistics, that is, the means and standard
deviations or variances for such a correlation.
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/discriminant-function-
analysis/#assumptions

After calculating the means and standard deviations for your variables
for each of your groups, check them to determine if large variability is
present in the means for one of your groups compared to the means for
the other group.

The Matrix Ill-Conditioning Problem

Another assumption of discriminant function analysis is that the
variables that are used to discriminate between groups are not
completely redundant. As part of the computations involved in
discriminant analysis, you will invert the variance/covariance matrix of
the variables in the model. If any one of the variables is completely
redundant with the other variables then the matrix is said to be ill-
conditioned, and it cannot be inverted. For example, if a variable is the
sum of three other variables that are also in the model, then the matrix
is ill-conditioned. http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/discriminant-
function-analysis/#assumptions

What this assumption means is that each variable should be unique
from any other variable in the analysis. Having one variable that
includes another variable would be a violation of this assumption. An
example of this would be using a total score that contains several
subscale scores, all of which are used in the discriminant analysis.

Tolerance Values.

In order to guard against matrix ill-conditioning, constantly check the
so-called tolerance value for each variable. This tolerance value is
computed as 1 minus R-square of the respective variable with all other
variables included in the current model. Thus, it is the proportion of
variance that is unique to the respective variable. In general, when a
variable is almost completely redundant (and, therefore, the matrix ill-
conditioning problem is likely to occur), the tolerance value for that
variable will approach 0.
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/discriminant-function-
analysis/#assumptions

We will check this assumption, the tolerance values, when we examine
the SPSS output.

      Rojas-LeBouef also assists students and faculty in their writing and
      statistical needs on the Writing and Statistical Help website.
The third table in the SPSS output for this canonical discriminant
analysis is the Stepwise Statistics table. In this example, five of the 10
variables differentiated boys from girls.

The next two tables indicate which variables remained in the
discriminant analysis and which variables were not utilized. The
variables that were not utilized did not contribute statistically
significantly to differentiating boys from girls. The process of
identifying variables in the analysis and variables not in the analysis is
depicted for each of the five steps.
If you recall from the beginning of this chapter, one of the assumptions
underlying use of a discriminant analysis procedure is tolerance values.
The closer to 0 the tolerance values are, the more likely it is that the
matrix is ill-conditioned and that overlap exists among the variables in
the equation. In Step 5 below, you will note that all of the tolerance
values are above 0, ranging from a low of .478 for Verbal 1
(Information) to a high of .880 for Performance 2 (Coding). Therefore,
this assumption has not been violated.
Under the Wilks' lambda table is a Summary of Canonical
Discriminant Functions table labeled Eigenvalues. In this table is the
canonical correlation, or Rc, which in this example is .325. This Rc
value reflects the correlation between the groups and the discriminant
function formed by the five variables that were statistically significant.
The Rc may be interpreted as a Pearson correlation of the discriminant
scores with the grouping variable. This information will be reported in
your Results section.
In the table below the Eigenvalues one is a table labeled Wilks'
Lambda. This measure is what is used to determine whether the
discriminant function is statistically significant in differentiating group
membership. In our example, the Wilks' Lambda of .894 is statistically
significant at the .001 level. This result means that the discriminant
function, consisting of five variables, statistically significantly
differentiated the group of boys from the group of girls. This
information will be reported in the Results section.
The table immediately below the Wilks' Lambda table is labeled
Standardized Canonical Discriminant Function Coefficients. These
values are also referred to as Standardized Discriminant Coefficients.
Contained in this table are the values that depict the relative
importance of each variable in differentiating group membership.
These coefficients are comparable to Beta Weights in multiple
regression. In this example, Verbal 4 (Vocabulary) is more important,
with a coefficient of .688, than is Performance 2 (Coding), with a
coefficient of .483, in differentiating boys from girls. These coefficients
should be provided in your Results section.
Next, we examine the table underneath the Standardized Canonical
Discriminant Function Coefficients, the one labeled as Structure
Matrix. Each of these values depicts the relationship of that variable
with the discriminant function scores. Each value is analogous to a
correlation coefficient. In the example below, Verbal 3 (Arithmetic) has
a correlation of .59 with the discriminant function scores. Similarly,
Performance 2 (Coding) and Verbal 4 (Vocabulary) have correlations
of .559 and .517, respectively, with the discriminant function scores.
These values may be interpreted as factor loadings in assigning a name
to the discriminant function. As such, the first three variables just
mentioned contribute more to the discriminant function than does the
variable of Performance 5 (Object Assembly).
Under this table is a table labeled Functions at Group Centroids. These
values are z-scores, with a M of 0 and a SD of 1. The group centroid
indicates the most typical location of any person from a particular
group. For this example, the group centroid for boys is .34 and the
group centroid for girls is -.347. Using these values we can compare
how far apart boys and girls are differentiated by the statistically
significant discriminant function in our example. The further apart
these two means or centroids are, the better the separation or
differentiation between the two groups. The centroids should be
reported in the Results section.

In this set of steps, readers will learn how to conduct a multiple
regression procedure. For detailed information regarding the
assumptions underlying use of a multiple regression analysis, readers
are referred to the Hyperstats Online Statistics Textbook at
http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/ ; to the Electronic Statistics Textbook
(2011) at http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/ ; or to Andy Field's (2009)

Method/dp/1847879071/ref=sr_1_1?

Research questions for which a multiple regression analysis is
appropriate involve determining variables that predict a continuous
variable. For example, if you want to predict the life expectancy of
individuals and you have archival data available (e.g., health history,
gender), then a multiple regression analysis procedure could be
utilized. Such a procedure could identify specific variables that are
predictive of a long or of a short life expectancy. As such, interventions
could be developed and targeted toward the variables that were
statistically significant predictors. Other sample research questions for
which a multiple regression analysis might be appropriate: (a) What
factors predict high scores on a scholastic aptitude measure?; and (b)
What factors are predictive of high scores on a life satisfaction scale?

For the purposes of this chapter, our research question is: "What
scholastic variables predict students' Full Scale IQ?"

Have your data set open in SPSS. In this dataset, we will determine
what variables, if any, are predictive of students' Wechsler Full Scale
IQ 3 (wifsiq). The 10 variables that we will use are: Picture Completion
(pc), Information (inf), Coding (cod), Similarities (sim), Picture
Arrangement (pa), Arithmetic (ari), Block Design (bd), Vocabulary
(voc), Object Assembly (oa), and Comprehension (comp).
As with every statistical procedure, we need to check the underlying
assumptions. One assumption involves the data being normally
distributed. To check this assumption, we recommend that you
calculate the standardized skewness coefficients and the standardized
kurtosis coefficients, as discussed in other chapters.

* Skewness [Note. Skewness refers to the extent to which the data are
normally distributed around the mean. Skewed data involve having
either mostly high scores with a few low ones or having mostly low
scores with a few high ones.] Readers are referred to the following
sources for a more detailed definition of skewness:
http://www.statistics.com/index.php?page=glossary&term_id=356 and
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/basic-
statistics/#Descriptive%20statisticsb

To standardize the skewness value so that its value can be constant
across datasets and across studies, the following calculation must be
made: Take the skewness value from the SPSS output and divide it by
the Std. error of skewness. If the resulting calculation is within -3 to +3,
then the skewness of the dataset is within the range of normality
(Onwuegbuzie & Daniel, 2002). If the resulting calculation is outside of
this +/-3 range, the dataset is not normally distributed.

* Kurtosis [Note. Kurtosis also refers to the extent to which the data
are normally distributed around the mean. This time, the data are piled
up higher than normal around the mean or piled up higher than
normal at the ends of the distribution.] Readers are referred to the
following sources for a more detailed definition of kurtosis:
http://www.statistics.com/index.php?page=glossary&term_id=326 and
http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/basic-
statistics/#Descriptive%20statisticsb

To standardize the kurtosis value so that its value can be constant
across datasets and across studies, the following calculation must be
made: Take the kurtosis value from the SPSS output and divide it by
the Std. error of kurtosis. If the resulting calculation is within -3 to +3,
then the kurtosis of the dataset is within the range of normality
(Onwuegbuzie & Daniel, 2002). If the resulting calculation is outside of
this +/-3 range, the dataset is not normally distributed.

Now that you have verified that your data are normally distributed, the
extent to which linearity is present between each of the 10 independent
variables listed above and the dependent variable of Full Scale IQ must
be determined. For linearity, we will have SPSS conduct scatterplots
for each IV and DV pair.

After clicking on Scatter/Dot, the following screen will appear. The
Simple Scatter icon should be highlighted. If not, click on it.

 Click on Define
The following screen should now be present.
 Drag one of the two variables of interest to the first box (Y axis) on
the right hand side and the other variable of interest to the second box
(X axis) on the right hand side. It does not matter which variable goes
in the X or Y axis because your scatterplot results will be the same. For
our purposes, we will place the variable we are trying to predict,
Wechsler Full Scale IQ 3, in the Y Axis box and one of the variables
(i.e., Performance 1) we will use to try to predict it.

 Once you have a variable in each of the first two boxes, click on the
OK tab on the bottom left hand corner of the screen.
 Look at the scatterplot to determine whether a linear relationship is
present. In the screenshot below, the relationship is very clearly linear.
You will need to repeat this process, for this example, nine more times.
Leave the dependent variable of Wechsler Full Scale IQ 3 in the Y Axis
box and replace the variable in the X Axis box with the next variable
(i.e., Verbal 1). Then click on OK.
After you have verified that linearity is present for each independent
variable with the dependent variable, we will examine the extent to
which multicollinearity is not present. Multicollinearity refers to
having variables that are highly correlated with each other. When
variables are highly correlated in a multiple regression analysis, the
unique contribution of each variable in predicting the dependent
variable is difficult to determine. The reason for this difficulty is that
highly interrelated variables are being used to predict the same
variance in the dependent variable. Researchers/statisticians disagree
on the specific correlation value that must be present for
multicollinearity to exist. Some persons contend that correlations above
.70 are necessary whereas other persons contend that the correlations
must be above .90 for multicollinearity to exist.

If multicollinearity is present, you can leave it as it is, and have SPSS
calculate the multiple regression. Multicollinearity influences the
results regarding each predictor's unique contribution. If your interest
is in the overall or combined effect of the statistically significant
predictors, then multicollinearity is not an issue. Other choices would
be to remove one or more of the highly correlated variables from the
regression analysis or to create an aggregate or composite of the highly
correlated variables.

The choice that we recommend is to have SPSS calculate
multicollinearity when the multiple regression analysis is calculated.
More on this later.

The first table in your SPSS output file should be a Descriptive
Statistics table. You will see a column for M, SD, and n. This
information should be used in your Results section.

Underneath the Descriptive Statistics table is a table labeled
Correlations. This table reflects the Pearson rs for each independent
variable with the dependent variable, as well as the interrelationships
among all of the variables.
Of the relationships of the independent variable with the Wechsler Full
Scale IQ 3 (the dependent variable in this example), Verbal 2
(Similarities) has the highest correlation, .768. In a stepwise regression
procedure, this variable should be the first statistically significant
predictor.
Next, you will see the Variables Entered/Removed table. We will not use
the information in this table.
The table labeled Model Summary is an important table. This table is a
summary of all of the steps entered/removed. Important columns in
this table are:

Adjusted R Square

R Square Change

Durbin-Watson
The Durbin-Watson statistic is a measure for significant residual
autocorrelation. Ideally it should be close to 2. In our example, the
Durbin-Watson statistic is 1.912. Therefore, this assumption has not
been violated.
The Adjusted R Square column indicates the amount of variance that
each model explains in the dependent variable (i.e., Wechsler Fll Scale
IQ 3). The first model has the letter a next to it. This model contains a
single independent variable, Verbal 2 (Similarities). If you recall, this
variable has the highest Pearson r with the Wechsler Full Scale IQ 3. In
this example, Verbal 2 (Similarities) accounts for 58.9% of the variance
in the Wechsler Full Scale IQ 3.
Each model, from 1 to 10, depicts the addition of another statistically
significant variable in predicting the Wechsler Full Scale IQ 3. The
final model, 10, indicates that all 10 independent variables accounted
for 99.6% of the variance in the Wechsler Full Scale IQ 3.
Next, examine the R Square Change column. Each value reflects the
unique variance in the Wechsler Full Scale IQ 3 explained by each
statistically significant predictor variable. For Model 1, Verbal 2
(Similarities) explained the most variance, 58.9%. In Model 2,
Performance 4 (Block Design) added 18.0% of unique variance that it
explained.
The final model, 10, only added 0.7% of additional variance explained.
The next table of importance is the ANOVA table. Each model is
examined to determine the extent to which it explains a statistically
significant amount of the variance in the dependent variable. Of
interest to us is the very last model, 10, which shows a statistically
significant result, F(10, 1122) = 31959.947, p < .001.
Underneath the ANOVA table is the Coefficients table. The important
columns in this table are the Standardized Coefficients Beta and the
Collinearity Statistics Tolerance and VIF ones. We will scroll down this
table until we get to the final model, 10, information.
Scrolling down to the last model information shows us the following
information. If you recall from the assumption checks, that
multicollinearity was to be examined in the SPSS output.
Multicollinearity is present when Tolerance values are below .1. As you
can tell from the output below, Tolerance values range from a low of
.386 to a high of .811. A second check for multicollinearity is the VIF
column. Multicollinearity is present in the VIF column when the VIF
values are greater than 10. In the example below, the VIF values range
from a low of 1.233 to a high of 2.592. Therefore, multicollinearity is
not present in this example.
The Standardized Coefficients Beta column is to be examined next.
Each of these values reflects the relative importance of each of these
statistically significant predictors. In this column, you will see that the
Betas range from a low of .130 to a high of .155, indicating that each
has about the same degree of relative importance.
In your Results section, you should discuss the assumptions that you
checked; the extent to which each assumption was met or not met; the
descriptive statistics; and the information in the columns that was
discussed at each step of the regression process.

You have now successfully gone through the calculation of a multiple
regression analysis.
