PREFACE

This text is intended for a brief introductory course in plane geometry. It covers
the topics from elementary geometry that are most likely to be required for
more advanced mathematics courses. The only prerequisite is a semester of
algebra.

    The emphasis is on applying basic geometric principles to the numerical
solution of problems. For this purpose the number of theorems and denitions is
kept small. Proofs are short and intuitive, mostly in the style of those found in a
typical trigonometry or precalculus text. There is little attempt to teach theorem-
proving or formal methods of reasoning. However the topics are ordered so that
they may be taught deductively.

   The problems are arranged in pairs so that just the odd-numbered or just the
even-numbered can be assigned. For assistance, the student may refer to a large
number of completely worked-out examples. Most problems are presented in
diagram form so that the diculty of translating words into pictures is avoided.
Many problems require the solution of algebraic equations in a geometric
context, These are included to reinforce the student's algebraic and numerical
skills. A few of the exercises involve the application of geometry to simple
practical problems, These serve primarily to convince the student that what he
or she is studying is useful. Historical notes are added where appropriate to give
the student a greater appreciation of the subject.

    This book is suitable for a course of about 45 semester hours. A shorter
course may be devised by skipping proofs, avoiding the more complicated
problems and omitting less crucial topics.

         LINES, ANGLES and TRIANGLES

   1.1 LINES

Geometry (from Greek words meaning earth-measure) originally developed as a means of
surveying land areas. In its simplest form, it is a study of gures that can be drawn on a
perfectly smooth at surface, or plane. It is this plane geometry which we will study in this
book and which serves as a foundation for trigonometry, solid and analytic geometry and
calculus.

  The simplest gures that can be drawn on a plane are the point and the line. By a line we
will always mean a straight line. Through two distinct points one and only one (straight)
line can be drawn. The line through points A and B will be denoted by AB (Figure 1).

  The arrows indicate that the line extends indenitely in each direction. The line segment
from A to B consists of A, B and that part of AB between A and B. It is denoted by AB.* The
ray AB is the part of AB which begins at A and extends indenitely in the direction of B.

                               Figure . Line AB, line segment AB, and ray AB.

   We assume everyone is familiar with the notion of length of a line segment and how it
can be measured inches, or feet, or meters etc. The distance between two points A and B is
the same as the length of AB.
Two line segments are equal if they have the same length.
In Figure 2, AB = CD.

   Figure . AB = CD.

5  * Some textbooks use the notation AB for line segment
                                            Lines, Angles and Triangles

We often indicate two line segments are equal by marking them in the same way.
In Figure 3, AB = CD and EF = GH.

                    Figure . AB = CD and EF = GH.

   EXAMPLE A
Find x if AB = CD:

SOLUTION                                           CHECK

ANSWER : x = 3.
Notice that in Example A we have not indicated the unit of measurement. Strictly speaking,
we should specify that AB = 3x - 6 inches (or feet or meters) and that CD = x inches.
However since the answer would still be x = 3 we will usually omit this information to save
space.
We say that B is the midpoint of AC if B is A point on AC and AB = BC (see Figure 4).

                                        Figure . B is the midpoint of AC.

                                                                                                                        6

      EXAMPLE B
   Find x and AC if B is the midpoint of AC and AB = 5(x - 3) and BC = 9 - x.

SOLUTION                                 CHECK

We rst draw a picture to help visualize
the given information:

Since 3 is a midpoint,

We obtain AC = AB + BC = 5 + 5 = 10.     CHECK
ANSWER : x = 4, AC = 10.

      EXAMPLE C
   Find AB if B is the midpoint of AC:

If x =6 then
AB = x2 - 6 = 62 - 6 = 36 - 6 = 30.

If x = -1 then
AB = (-1)2 - 6 = 1 - 6 = -5.

We reject the answer x = -1 and AB = -5
because the length of a line segment is always
positive. Therefore x = 6 and AB = 30.

ANSWER : AB = 30.
Three points are collinear if they lie on the same line.

Figure . A, B and C are collinear               Figure . A, B and C are not collinear
           AB = 5, BC = 3 and AC =8.                       AB = 5, BC = 3 and AC = 6.

A, B, and C are collinear if and only if AB + BC = AC.

   EXAMPLE D
If A, B, and C are collinear and AC = 7, nd x:

SOLUTION                                                                 CHECK

ANSWER : x = 2.

              HISTORICAL NOTE

     Geometry originated in the solution of practical problems. The architectural remains
     of Babylon, Egypt, and other ancient civilizations show a knowledge of simple
     geometric relationships. The digging of canals, erection of buildings, and the laying
     out of cities required computations of lengths, areas, and volumes. Surveying is said
     to have developed in Egypt so that tracts of land could be relocated after the annual
     overow of the Nile. Geometry was also utilized by ancient civilizations in their
     astronomical observations and the construction of their calendars.

        The Greeks transformed the practical geometry of the Babylonians and Egyptians
     into an organized body of knowledge. Thales (c, 636 - c. 546 B,C.), one of the
     "seven wise men" of antiquity, is credited with being the rst to obtain geometrical
     results by logical reasoning, instead of just by intuition and experiment. Pythagoras
     (c. 582 - c. 507 B,C.) continued the work of Thales. He founded the Pythagorean
     school, a mystical society devoted to the unied study of philosophy, mathematics,
     and science. About 300 B,C., Euclid, a Greek teacher of mathematics at the
     university at Alexandria, wrote a systematic exposition of elementary geometry
     called the Elements. In his Elements, Euclid used a few simple principles, called
     axioms or postulates, to derive most of the mathematics known at the time. For
     over 2000 years, Euclid's Elements has been accepted as the standard textbook of
     geometry and is the basis for most other elementary texts, including this one.

   1.2 ANGLES
An angle is the gure formed by two rays with a common end point. The two rays are called
the sides of the angle and the common end point is called the vertex of the angle. The
symbol for angle is .

                        Figure . Angle BAC has vertex A and sides AB and AC.
    The angle in Figure 1 has vertex A and sides AB and AC. It is denoted by BAC or
CAB or simply A . When three letters are used, the middle letter is always the vertex. In
Figure 2 we would not use the notation A as an abbreviation for BAC because it could
also mean CAD or BAD. We could however use the simplier name x for BAC if "x" is
marked in as shown.

                                                        x

                                  Figure . BAC may also be denoted by x.
  Angles can be measured with an instrument called a protractor. The unit of measurement
is called a degree and the symbol for degree is °.
  To measure an angle, place the center of the protractor (often marked with a cross or a
small circle) on the vertex of the angle. Position the protractor so that one side of the angle
cuts across 0, at the beginning of the scale, and so that the other side cuts across a point
further up on the scale. We use either the upper scale or the lower scale, whichever is more
convenient. For example, in Figure 3, one side of BAC crosses 0 on the lower scale and
the other side crosses 50 on the lower scale. The measure of BAC is therefore 50° and we
write BAC = 50° .

                                Figure . The protractor shows BAC = 50°.
In Figure 4, side AD of DAC crosses 130 on the upper scale. Therefore we look on the
upper scale for the point at which AC crosses and conclude that DAC = 130°.

                                            Figure . DAC = 130°.

      EXAMPLE A
   Draw an angle of 40° and label it BAC .
 SOLUTION
Draw ray AB using a straight edge:
Place the protractor so that its center coincides with A and AB crosses the scale at 0:

                                                                                                                      12

Two angles are said to be equal if they have the same measure in degrees. We often indicate
two angles are equal by marking them in the same way. In Figure 5, A = B.

                                             Figure . Equal angles.
An angle bisector is a ray which divides an angle into two equal angles. In Figure 6, AC is
an angle bisector of BAD . We also say AC bisects BAD .

                                          Figure . AC bisects BAD.

      EXAMPLE B

Angles are classied according to their measures as follow:
· An acute angle is an angle whose measure is between 0° and 90°.
· A right angle is an angle whose measure is 90°. We often use a little square to indicate a
  right angle.
· An obtuse angle is an angle whose measure is between 90° and 180°.
· A straight angle is an angle whose measure is 180°. A straight angle is just a straight line
  with one of its points designated as the vertex.
· A reex angle is an angle whose measure is greater than 180°.

                            Figure . Angles classied according to their measures.
   Notice that an angle can be measured in two ways. In Figure 2, ABC is a reex of 240°
or an obtuse angle of 120° depending on how it is measured. Unless otherwise indicated, we
will always assume the angle has measure less than 180°.

                           Figure . ABC can be measured in two dierent ways.

    Two lines are perpendicular if they meet to form right angles. In Figure 3, AB is
perpendicular to CD. The symbol for perpendicular is  and we write ABCD.

                                      Figure . AB is perpendicular to CD.
   The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line perpendicular to the line segment
at its midpoint. In Figure 4, CD is a perpendicular bisector of AB .

                                Figure . CD is a perpendicular bisector of AB.
   Two angles are called complementary if the sum of their measures is 90°. Each angle is
called the complement of the other. For example, angles of 60° and 30° are complementary.

                            positive.*

      *In trigonometry, when directed angles are introduced, angles can have negative measure. In this
21 book, however, all angles will be thought of as having positive measure.

Two angles are called supplementary if the sum of their measures is 180°. Each angle is
called the supplement of the other. For example, angle of 150° and 30° are supplementary.

SOLUTION           CHECK
Since ADB = 180°,

ADC = 4x - 20° = 4(40) - 20 = 160 - 20 = 140°
BDC = x = 40°
ADC + BDC = 140° + 40° = 180°.

ANSWER : x = 40°, ADC = 140°, BDC = 40°

                           x°
                          z° y°

SOLUTION
  x° = 180° - 80° = 100° because x° and 80° are the measures of supplementary angles.
  y° = 180° - x° = 180° - 100° = 80°
  z° = 180° - 80° = 100°

                                                                x°=100°

ANSWER : x = 100°, y = 80°, z = 100°

When two lines intersect as in Example E, they form two pairs of angles that are opposite to
each other called vertical angles. In Figure 7, x and x are one pair of vertical angles. y
and y are the other pair of vertical angles. As suggested by Example E, x = x and
y = y. To see this in general, we can reason as follows: x is the supplement of y so
x = 180° - y . x is also the supplement of y so x = 180° - y .
Therefore x = x. Similarly, we can show y = y. Therefore vertical angles are always
equal.

                   Figure . x, x' and y, and y' are pairs of vertical angles.
We can now use "vertical angles are equal" in solving problems:

                                   z° y°

SOLUTION
x = 180° - 80° = 100° because x is the supplement of 80°.
y = 80° because vertical angles are equal.
z = x = 100° because vertical angles are equal.

ANSWER : x = 100°, y = 80°, z = 100°

      EXAMPLE F
  Find x:

SOLUTION                                               Method 

Since the vertical angles are equal, 10x2 = 40°.
                  Method 

If x = 2 then AEC = 10x2 = 10(2)2 = 10(4) = 40°.
If x = -2 then AEC = 10x2 = 10(-2)2 = 10(4) = 40° .

                                                                                                                   24

   We accept the solution x = -2 even though x is negative because the value of the angle
10x2 is still positive.

    the mirror from C and E represents the eye of a person observing the ray as it is
    reected from the mirror at D. According to a law of physics, CDA equals EDB. If
    CDE = 60°, how much is x?

 SOLUTION
   Let x° = CDA = EDB
   x + x + 60 = 180
     2x + 60 = 180
            2x = 120

         THEOREMS AND POSTULATES

The statement "vertical angles are always equal" is an example of a theorem. A
theorem is a statement which we can prove to be true. A proof is a process of
reasoning which uses statements already known to be true to show the truth of a
new statement. An example of a proof is the discussion preceding the statement
"Vertical angles are always equal." We used facts about supplementary angles that
were already known to establish the new statement, that "Vertical angles are always
equal."

   Ideally we would like to prove all statements in mathematics which we think are
true. However before we can begin proving anything we need some true statements
with which to start. Such statements should be so self-evident as not to require
proofs themselves. A statement of this kind, which we assume to be true without
proof, is called a postulate or an axiom. An example of a postulate is the
assumption that all angles can be measured in degrees. This was used without
actually being stated in our proof that "Vertical angles are always equal."

  Theorems, proofs, and postulates constitute the heart of mathematics and we will
encounter many more of them as we continue our study of geometry.

   1.4 PARALLEL LINES

Two lines are parallel if they do not meet, no matter how far they are extended. The symbol
for parallel is ||. In Figure 1, AB || CD. The arrow marks are used to indicate the lines are
parallel.

Figure . AB and CD are parallel. They do not meet  Figure . EF and GH are not parallel.
no matter how far they are extended.                          They meet at point P.

 We make the following assumption about parallel lines, called the parallel postulate:
Through a point not on a given line one and only one line can be drawn parallel to the given
line.
So in Figure 3, there is exactly one line that can be drawn through C that is parallel to AB.

Figure . There is exactly one line that can be drawn through C parallel to AB.

Figure . EF is a transversal.
                                                                          30
                                            Lines, Angles and Triangles

   A transversal is a line that intersects two other lines at two distinct points. In Figure 4,
EF is a transversal. x and x are called alternate intertor angles of lines AB and CD. The
word "alternate," here, means that the angles are on dierent sides of the transversal, one
angle formed with AB and the other formed with CD. The word "interior" means that they
are between the two lines. Notice that they form the letter "Z"(Figure 5). y and y are also
alternate intertor angles. They also form a "Z" though it is stretched out and backwards.
Viewed from the side, the letter "Z" may also look like an "N."

 Figure . Alternate interior angles form the letter of "Z" or "N". The letters may be stretched out or
                                                      backwards.

Alternate interior angles are important because of the following theorem:

      THEOREM 1 (THE "Z" THEOREM)
If two lines are parallel then their alternate interior angles are equal. If the alternate interior
angles of two lines are equal then the lines must be parallel.

  In Figure 6, AB must be parallel to CD because the alternate interior angles are both 30°.
Notice that the other pair of alternate interior angles, y and y, are also equal. They are
both 150°. In Figure 7, the lines are not parallel and none of the alternate interior angles are
equal.

Figure . The lines are parallel and their  Figure . The lines are not parallel and their
alternate interior angles are equal.       alternate interior angles are not equal.

The proof of Theorem 1 is complicated and will be deferred to the appendix.

      EXAMPLE A
Find x, y and z:

SOLUTION
AB || CD since the arrows indicate parallel lines. x = 40° because alternate interior angles of
parallel lines are equal. y° = z°= 180° - 40° = 140°.
ANSWER : x = 40°, y = 140°, z = 140°.

  Corresponding angles of two lines are two angles which are on the same side of the two
lines and the same side of the transversal. In Figure 8, w and w are corresponding
angles of lines AB and CD. They form the letter "F". x and x, y and y and z and z
are other pairs of corresponding angles of AB and CD. They all form the letter "F", though it
might be a backwards or upside down "F" (Figure 9)

                        Figure . Four pairs of corresponding angles are illustrated.

                                                                                                                      32

                              Figure . Corresponding angles form the letter "F",
                               though it may be a backwards or upside down"F".
Corresponding angles are important because of the following theorem:

      THEOREM 2 (THE "F" THEOREM)
 If two lines are parallel then their corresponding angles are equal. If the corresponding
 angles of two lines are equal then the lines must be parallel.

      EXAMPLE B
 Find x:

SOLUTION
The arrow indicate AB || CD. Therefore x = 110° because x° and 110° are the measures of
corresponding angles of the parallel lines AB and CD.
ANSWER : x = 110.

Lines, Angles and Triangles

                            Figure . Each pair of corresponding angles is equal.

   Notice that we can now nd all the other angles in Example B. Each one is either
supplementary to one of the 110° angles or forms equal vertical angles with one of them
(Figure 10). Therefore all the corresponding angles are equal. Also each pair of alternate
interior angles is equal. It is not hard to see that if just one pair of corresponding angles or
one pair of alternate interior angles are equal then so are all other pairs of corresponding
and alternate interior angles.

Proof of Theorem : The corresponding angles will be equal if the alternate interior angles
are equal and vice versa. Therefore Theorem 2 follows directly from Therorem 1.

   In Figure 11, x and x are called interior angles on the same side of the
transversal.* y and y are also interior angles on the same side of the transversal. Notice
that each pair of angles forms the letter "C". Compare Figure 11 with Figure 10 and also
with Example A. The following theorem is then apparent:

Figure . Interior angles on the same side of the transversal form the letter "C".
                                    It may also be a backwards "C".

*In some textbooks, interior angles on the same side of the transversal are called cointerior angles.  34

      THEOREM 3 (THE "C" THEOREM)
 If two lines are parallel then the interior angles on the same side of the transversal are
 supplementary (they add up to 180°). If the interior angles of two lines on the same side
 of the transversal are supplementary then the lines must be parallel.

      EXAMPLE C

SOLUTION
BEF = 3x + 40° because vertical angles are equal, BEF and DFE are interior angles on
the same side of the transversal, and therefore are supplementary because the lines are
parallel.

       3x + 40 + 2x + 50 = 180

x° = BCE because they are alternate interior angles of parallel lines AB and CE.
DCF = BCE = x° because of the laws of physics.
Therefore

                 x + 70 + x = 180

              HISTORICAL NOTE

     The parallel postulate given earlier in this section is the equivalent of the fth
     postulate of Euclid's Elements. Euclid was correct in assuming it as a postulate rather
     than trying to prove it as a theorem. However this did not become clear to the
     mathematical world until the nineteenth century, 2200 years later. In the interim,
     scores of prominent mathematicians attempted unsuccessfully to give a satisfactory
     proof of the parallel postulate. They felt that it was not as self-evident as a postulate
     should be, and that it required some formal justication.

         In 1826, N. I. Lobachevsky, a Russian mathematician, presented a system of
     geometry based on the assumption that through a given point more than one
     straight line can be drawn parallel to a given line (see Figure 13). In 1854, the
     German mathematician Georg Bernhard Riemann proposed a system of geometry in
     which there are no parallel lines at all. A geometry in which the parallel postulate
     has been replaced by some other postulate is called a non-Euclidean geometry. The
     existence of these geometries shows that the parallel postulate need not necessarily
     be true. Indeed Einstein used the geometry of Riemann as the basis for his theory of
     relativity.

         Of course our original parallel postulate makes the most sense for ordinary
     applications, and we use it throughout this book. However, for applications where
     great distances are involved, such as in astronomy, it may well be that a non-
     Euclidean geometry gives a better approximation of physical reality.

         Figure . In the geometry of Lobachevsky, more than one line can be drawn
                                         through C parallel to AB.

   1.5 TRIANGLES
A triangle is formed when three straight line segments bound a portion of the plane, The
line segments are called the sides of the triangle. A point where two sides meet is called a
vertex of the triangle, and the angle formed is called an angle of the triangle. The symbol
for triangle is .

   The triangle in Figure 1 is denoted by ABC (or BCA or CAB, etc.). Its sides are
AB, AC, and BC. Its vertices are A, B, and C. Its angles are A , B, and C .

                                              Figure . Triangle ABC
   The triangle is the most important gure in plane geometry. This is because gures with
more than 3 sides can always be divided into triangles(Figure 2). If we know the properties
of a triangle, we can extend this knowledge to the study of other gures as well.

     Figure . A closed gure formed by more than 3 straight lines can be divided into triangles.
A fundamental property of triangles is the following:

      THEOREM 1
  The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°. In ABC of Figure 1;
 A + B + C = 180° .

   EXAMPLE A
Find C:

              40°  60°

SOLUTION

   A + B + C = 180°
    40° + 60° + C = 180°

         100° + C = 180°
                   C = 180° - 100°
                   C = 80°

ANSWER : C = 80°

Proof of Theorem  :

Through C draw DE parallel to AB (see Figure 3). Note that we are using the parallel
postulate here. 1 = A and 3 = B because they are alternate interior angles of parallel
lines.
A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 2 = 180°.

                                 Figure . Through C draw DE parallel to AB.
   We may verify Theorem 1 by measuring the angles of a triangle with a protractor and
taking the sum, However no measuring instrument is perfectly accurate, It is reasonable to
expect an answer such as 179°, 182°, 180.5°, etc. The purpose of our mathematical proof is
to assure us that the sum of the angles of every triangle must be exactly 180°.

                                                                                                                      46

   There is one more simple principle which we will derive from Theorem 1.
Consider the two triangles in Figure 5.

                              Figure . Each triangle has an angle of 60° and 40°.
   We are given that A = D = 60° and B = E = 40°. A short calculation shows that we
must also have C = F = 80°. This suggests the following theorem:

      THEOREM 3
If two angles of one triangle are equal respectively to two angles of another triangle, then
their remaining angles are also equal.
In Figure 6, if A = D and B = E then C = F .
  Proof of Theorem  :
  C= 180° - (A + B) = 180° - (D + E) = F

          HISTORICAL NOTE

Our Theorem 1, which states that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°, is one
of the most important consequences of the parallel postulate, Therefore, one way of
testing the truth of the parallel postulate(see the Historical Note in section 1.4) is
to test the truth of Theorem 1. This was actually tried by the German
mathematician, astronomer and physicist, Karl Friedrich Gauss(1777 - 1855). (This
is the same Gauss whose name is used as a unit of measurement in the theory of
magnetism). Gauss measured the sum of the angles of the triangle formed by three
mountain peaks in Germany. He found the sum of the angles to be 14.85 seconds
more than 180°(60 seconds 1 minute, 60 minutes = 1 degree). However this small
excess could have been due to experimental error, so the sum might actually have
been 180°.

  Aside from experimental error, there is another diculty involved in verifying the
angle sum theorem. According to the non-Euclidean geometry of Lobachevsky, the
sum of the angles of a triangle is always less than 180°. In the non-Euclidean
geometry of Riemann, the sum of the angles is always more than 180°. However in
both cases the dierence from 180° is insignicant unless the triangle is very large.
Neither theory tells us exactly how large such a triangle should be. Even if we
measured the angles of a very large triangle, like one formed by three stars, and
found the sum to be indistinguishable from 180°, we could only say that the angle
sum theorem and parallel postulate are apparently true for these large distances.
These distances still might be too small to enable us to determine which geometric
system best describes the universe as a whole.

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of the sides. The perimeter of ABC
in Figure 7 is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the remaining side.

             CONGRUENT TRIANGLES

  2.1 THE CONGRUENCE STATEMENT

Two triangles are said to be congruent if one can be placed over the other so that they
coincide (t together). This means that congruent triangles are exact copies of each other
and when tted together the sides and angles which coincide, called corresponding sides
and angles, are equal.

  In Figure 1, ABC is congruent to DEF. The symbol for congruence is  and we write
ABC  DEF. A corresponds to D, B corresponds to E and C corresponds to
F. Side AB corresponds to DE, BC corresponds to EF and AC corresponds to DF.

     90°            90°

53°       37°  53°       37°

                                    Figure . ABC is congruent to DEF.

   In this book the congruence statement ABC  DEF will always be written so that
corresponding vertices appear in the same order. For the triangles in Figure 1, we might
also write BAC  EDF or ACB  DFE but never for example ABC  EDF nor
ACB  DEF.*

  Therefore we can always tell which parts correspond just from the congruence statement.
For example, given that ABC  DEF, side AB corresponds to side DE because each
consists of the rst two letters. AC corresponds to DF because each consists of the rst and
last letters. BC corresponds to EF because each consists of the last two letters.

* Be warned that not all textbooks follow this practice. Many authors will write the letters without
regard to the order. If that is the case then we cannot tell which parts correspond from the 64
congruence statement.

   2.2 THE SAS THEOREM

We have said that two triangles are congruent if all their corresponding sides and angles are
equal. However in some cases, it is possible to conclude that two triangles are congruent,
with only partial information about their sides and angles.

  Suppose we are told that ABC has A = 53°, AB = 5 inches, and AC = 3 inches. Let us
attempt to sketch ABC. We rst draw an angle of 53° with a protractor and label it A.
Using a ruler, we nd the point 5 inches from the vertex on one side of the angle and label it
B. On the other side of the angle, we nd the point 3 inches from the vertex and label it C.
See Figure 1. There is now only one way for us to complete our sketch of ABC, and that is
to connect points B and C with a line segment. We could now measure BC, B, and C to
nd the remaining parts of the triangle.

    Figure . Sketching ABC.  Figure . Sketching DEF.

   Suppose now DEF were another triangle, with D = 53°, DE= 5 inches, and DF = 3
inches. We could sketch DEF just as we did ABC, and then measure EF, E, and F
(Figure 2). It is clear that we must have BC = EF, B = E, and C = F because both
triangles were drawn in exactly the same way. Therefore ABC  DEF.

  In ABC, we say that A is the angle included between sides AB and AC.
  In DEF, we say that D is the angle included between sides DE and DF.

Our discussion suggests the following theorem:

      THEOREM 1 (SAS or SIDE - ANGLE - SIDE THEOREM)

 Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the included angle of one are equal
 respectively to two sides and the included angle of the other.

   In Figures 1 and 2, ABC  DEF because AB, AC, and A are equal respectively to
DE, DF, and D. We sometimes abbreviate Theorem 1 by simply writing SAS = SAS.

      EXAMPLE A
  In PQR name the angle included between sides

     (1) PQ and QR,
     (2) PQ and PR,
     and (3) PR and QR.

 SOLUTION
Note that the included angle is named by the letter that is common to both sides.
For (1), the letter "Q" is common to PQ and QR and so Q is included between sides PQ
and QR. Similarly for (2) and (3).
 ANSWER : (1) Q (2) P (3) R.

      EXAMPLE B
  For the two triangles in the diagram
  (1) list two sides and an included angle of each triangle that are respectively equal, using

       the information given in the diagram,
  (2) write the congruence statement,
  and (3) nd x by identifying a pair of corresponding sides of the congruent triangles.

 SOLUTION
(1) The angles and sides that are marked the same way in the diagram are assumed to be
equal. So B in ABD is equal to D in CDB.
Therefore "B" corresponds to "D." We also have AB = CD, Therefore "A" must correspond to
"C". Thus, if the triangles are congruent, the correspondence must be

  Finally, BD (the same as DB) is a side common to both triangles. Summaryzing,

                                                                                                                      70

(2) ABD  CDB because of the SAS Theorem (SAS = SAS).
(3) x = AD = CB = 10 because AD and CB are corresponding sides (rst and third letters

in the congruence statement) and corresponding sides of congruent triangles are equal.

ANSWER :

(1) AB, B, BD of ABD = CD, D, DB of CDB,
(2) ABD  CDB
(3) x = AD = CB = 10

      EXAMPLE C

    For the two triangles in the diagram
(1) list two sides and an included angle of each triangle that arerespectively equal, using the

    information given in the diagram,
(2) write the congruence statement,
and (3) nd x and y by identifying a pair of corresponding sides of the congruent triangles.

                3x + 5y°                       45°

                               50°
2x + y°

 SOLUTION
(1) AC = CE and BC = CD because they are marked the same way. We also know that
ACB = ECD = 50° because vertical angles are equal.

Therefore "C" in ABC corresponds to "C" in CDE. Since AC = CE, we must have that
"A" in ABC corresponds to "E" in CDE. Thus, if the triangles are congruent, the
correspondence must be

                              BC = DC

(2) ABC  EDC because of the SAS Theorem (SAS = SAS).
(3) A = E and B = D because they are corresponding angles of the congruent triang-

    les. D = 85° because the sum of the angles of EDC must be 180°.
    (D = 180° - (50° + 45°) = 180° - 95° = 85°). We obtain a system of two equations in

    the two unknowns x and y :

A = E          2x + y = 45 -5  -10x - 5y = -225
B = D          3x + 5y = 85    3x + 5y = 85

 Finally, DE was found to be 110 feet.

          HISTORICAL NOTE

The SAS Theorem is Proposition 4 in Euclid's Elements. Both our discussion and
Euclid's proof of the SAS Theorem implicitly use the following principle: If a
geometric construction is repeated in a dierent location (or what amounts to the
same thing is "moved" to a dierent location) then the size and shape of the gure
remain the same. There is evidence that Euclid used this principle reluctantly, and
many mathematicians have since questioned its use in formal proofs. They feel that
it makes too strong an assumption about the nature of physical space and is an
inferior form of geometric reasoning. Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970), for example,
has suggested that we would be better o assuming the SAS Theorem as a postulate.
This is in fact done in a system of axioms for Euclidean geometry devised by David
Hilbert (1862 - 1943), a system that has gained much favor with modern
mathematicians. Hilbert was the leading exponent of the "formalist school," which
sought to discover exactly what assumptions underlie each branch of mathematics
and to remove all logical ambiguities. Hilbert's system, however, is too formal for an
introductory course in geometry.

   2.3 THE ASA and AAS THEOREMS

In this section we will consider two more cases where it is possible to conclude that triangles
are congruent with only partial information about their sides and angles.
Suppose we are told that ABC has A = 30°, B = 40°, and AB = 2 inches. Let us attempt
to sketch ABC. We rst draw a line segment of 2 inches and label it AB. With a protractor
we draw an angle of 30° at A and an angle of 40° at B(Figure 1). We extend the lines
forming A and B until they meet at C. We could now measure AC, BC, and C to nd
the remaining parts of the triangle.

30°  40°                                30°  40°

Figure . Sketching ABC.                 Figure . Sketching DEF.

   Let DEF be another triangle, with D = 30°, E = 40°, and DE = 2 inches. We could
sketch DEF just as we did ABC, and then measure DF, EF, and F(Figure 2 ). It is clear
that we must have AC = DF, BC = EF, and C = F, because both triangles were drawn in
exactly the same way. Therefore ABC  DEF.
In ABC we say that AB is the side included between A and B. In DEF we would
say that DE is the side included between D and E. Our discussion suggests the following
theorem:

      THEOREM 1 (ASA or ANGLE - SIDE - ANGLE THEOREM)

    Two triangles are congruent if two angles and an included side of one are equal
 respectively to two angles and an included side of the other.

  In Figure 1 and 2, ABC  DEF because A, B, and AB are equal respectively to D,
E, and DE.
We sometimes abbreviate Theorem 1 by simply writing ASA = ASA.

   EXAMPLE A

In PQR, name the side included between
  (1) P and Q,
  (2) P and R,
  (3) Q and R.

                                                                 78
                                                Congruent Triangles

 SOLUTION
Note that the included side is named by the two letters representing each of the angles.
Therefore, for(1), the side included between P and Q is named by the letters P and Q --
that is, side PQ. Similarly for (2) and (3).
ANSWER : (1)PQ, (2)PR , (3)QR.

      EXAMPLE B

   For the two triangles in the diagram
   (1) write the congruence statement,
   (2) give a reason for (1),
   and (3) nd x and y.

 SOLUTION

(1) From the diagram A in ABC is equal to C in ADC. Therefore, "A" corresponds to
"C". Also C in ABC is equal to A in ADC. So "C" corresponds to "A". We have

(2) A, C, and included side AC of ABC are equal respectively to C, A, and included
side CA of CDA. (AC = CA because they are just dierent names for the identical line
segment. We sometimes say AC=CA because of identity.)
Therefore ABC  CDA because of the ASA Theorem (ASA = ASA).

                ABC CDA

  Angle         BAC = DCA   (marked = in diagram)
Included angle     AC = CA  (identity)
                            (marked = in diagram)
   Side         BCA = DAC

    (3) AB = CD and BC = DA because they are corresponding sides of the congruent
         triangles. Therefore x = AB = CD = 12 and y = BC = DA = 11.

79
                                              Congruent Triangles

ANSWER :
 (1) ABC  CDA
 (2) ASA = ASA: A, AC, C of ABC = C, CA, A of CDA.
 (3) x = 12, y = 11.

Let us now consider ABC and DEF in Figure 3.

60°  50°  60°                                                      50°

 Figure . Two angles and an unincluded side of ABC are equal respectively to two angles and an
                                             unincluded side of DEF.

   A and B of ABC are equal respectively to D and E of DEF, yet we have no
information about the sides included between these angles, AB and DE. Instead we know
that the unincluded side BC is equal to the corresponding unincluded side EF. Therefore, as
things stand, we cannot use ASA = ASA to conclude that the triangles are congruent.
However we may show C equals F as in Theorem 3, section 1.5 (C = 180° - (60° +
50°) = 180° - 110° = 70° and F = 180° - (60° + 50°) = 180° - 110° = 70°).
Then we can apply the ASA Theorem to angles B and C and their included side BC and
the corresponding angles E and F with included side EF. These remarks lead us to the
following theorem:

      THEOREM 2 (AAS or ANGLE - ANGLE - SIDE THEOREM)

 Two triangles are congruent if two angles and an unincluded side of one triangle are equal
 respectively to two angles and the corresponding unincluded side of the other triangle
 (AAS = AAS).

In Figure 4, if A = D, B = E and BC = EF then ABC  DEF.

                                                                        80
           Congruent Triangles

                        Figure . These two triangles are congruent by AAS = AAS.

Proof of Theorem  :
C = 180°- (A + B) = 180° - (D + E) = F. The triangles are then congruent by
ASA = ASA applied to B. C and BC of ABC and E, F and EF of DEF.

      EXAMPLE C

  For the two triangles in the diagram
  (1) write the congruence statement,
  (2) give a reason for (1),
  and (3) nd x and y.

 SOLUTION

(1) ACD  BCD
(2) AAS = AAS since A, C and unincluded side CD of ACD are equal respectively to

    B, C and unincluded side CD of BCD.

(3) AC = BC and AD = BD since they are corresponding sides of the congruent triangles.
    Therefore x = AC = BC = 10 and y = AD = BD.
    Since AB = AD + BD = y + y = 2y =12, we must have y=6.

ANSWER :
(1) ACD  BCD.
(2) AAS = AAS: A, C, CD of ACD = B, C, CD of BCD.
(3) x = 10, y = 6.

      EXAMPLE D

   For the two triangles in the diagram
   (1) write the congruence statement,
   (2) give a reason for (1),
   and (3) nd x and y.

SOLUTION

Part(1) and part(2) are identical to Example B.

(3) AB = CD        and          BC = DA
                                3x = 2y + 4
3x - y = 2x + 1            3x - 2y = 4

3x - 2x - y = 1

x-y = 1

We solve these equations simultaneously for x and y:.      x-y = 1
                                                           2-y = 1
   x - y = 1 -2    -2x + 2y = -2
3x - 2y = 4                                                  -y = 1-2
                   + 3x - 2y = 4                             - y = -1

                        x  = 2                                 y=1

ANSWER : (1) and (2) same as Example B. (3) x = 2, y = 1.
                                                Congruent Triangles

      EXAMPLE E
   From the top of a tower T on the shore, a ship S is sighted at sea. A point P along the
coast is also sighted from T so that PTB = STB. If the distance from P to the base of the
tower B is 3 miles, how far is the ship from point B on the shore?.

 SOLUTION
   PTB  STB by ASA = ASA. Therefore x = SB = FB = 3.
 ANSWER : 3 miles.

              HISTORICAL NOTE

        The method of nding the distance of ships at sea described in Example E has
     been attributed to the Greek philosopher Thales (c. 600 B.C.). We know from
     various authors that the ASA Theorem has been used to measure distances since
     ancient times. There is a story that one of Napoleon's ocers used the ASA
     Theorem to measure the width of a river his army had to cross, (see Problem 25
     below.)

   2.4 PROVING LINES and ANGLES EQUAL

We can prove lines and angles equal if we can show they are corresponding parts of
congruent triangles. We nd it convenient to present these proofs in double-column form
with statements in the left column and the reason for each statement in the right.

      EXAMPLE A
   Given AB || CD and AB = CD prove AD = BC.

SOLUTION

          Statements  Reasons

    1 AB = CD         1 Given.
    2 ADB = CDB               Alternate interior angles of parallel lines

                      2 (AB || CD) are equal.

    3 BD = DB         3 Identity.
    4 ABD  CDB
    5 AD = BC         4 SAS = SAS: AB, B, BD of ABD = CD, D DB of CDB.
                      5 Corresponding sides of congruent triangles are equal.

Explanation: Each of the rst three statements says that a side or angle of ABD is equal to
the corresponding side or angle of CDB. To arrive at these statements, we should rst

write the congruence statement using the methods of the previous sections. We then select

three pairs of corresponding sides or angles which are equal because of one of the following

reasons:

87
                                                Congruent Triangles

Reasons lines are equal
  (1) Given. This means we are asked to assume the lines are equal at the beginning of the
      exercise. For example, the problem will state "given AB = CD " or AB and CD will be
      marked the same way in the diagram.
  (2) Identity. This means the identical line segment appears in both triangles. For example,
      BD and DB represent the same line segment, Of course the length of a line segment
      is equal to itself.

Reasons angles are equal
  (1) Given.
  (2) Identity.
  (3) Alternate interior angles of parallel lines are equal. To apply this reason we must be given that
      the lines are parallel.
  (4) Corresponding angles of parallel lines equal.
  (5) Vertical angles are equal.

   These are not the only possible reasons but they are all that we will use at rst.
We should also select the three pairs of equal sides or angles so that one of the reasons SAS
= SAS, ASA = ASA, or AAS = AAS can be used to justify the congruence statement in
statement 4. In sections 2.6 and 2.7, we will give some additional reasons for two triangles
to be congruent.

   Statement 5 is the one we wish to prove. The reason is that corresponding sides (or
angles) of congruent triangles are equal. We can use this reason here because the triangles
have already been proven congruent in statement 4.

   One nal comment. Notice how the solution of Example A conforms with our original
denition of proof. Each new statement is shown to be true by using previous statements
and reasons which have already been established. Let us give another example:

      EXAMPLE B
   Given QP || ST and QR = TR prove PR = SR.

                                                                                                                      88

   2.5 ISOSCELES TRIANGLES

In section 1.6, we dened a triangle to be isosceles if two of its sides are equal. Figure 1
shows an isosceles triangle ABC with AC = BC. In ABC we say that A is opposite side
BC and B is opposite side AC.

                                  Figure . ABC is isosceles with AC = BC.
The most important fact about isosceles triangles is the following:.

      THEOREM 1
   If two sides of a triangle are equal the angles opposite these sides are equal.
  Theorem 1 means that if AC = BC in ABC then A = B.

      EXAMPLE A
   Find x:

x°  40°

SOLUTION

AC = BC so A = B. Therefore, x = 40.
ANSWER : x = 40.

   In ABC if AC = BC then side AB is called the base of the triangle and A and B are
called the base angles. Therefore Theorem 1 is sometimes stated in the following way: "The
base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal."

                                                                                                                      92

Proof of Theorem :
Draw CD, the angle bisector of ACB(Figure 2). The rest of the proof will be presented in
double-column form. We have given that AC = BC and ACD = BCD.
We must prove A = B .

 SOLUTION
B = A = 4x + 5° by Theorem 1. We have

                  A + B + C = 180°
    4x + 5 + 4x + 5 + 2x - 10 = 180

                                10x = 180
                                   x = 18

  A = B = 4x + 5° = 4(18) + 5° = 72° + 5° = 77°
  C = 2x - 10° = 2(18) - 10° = 36 - 10° = 26°

                              A + B + C = 180°

                                           180°

ANSWER : x = 18, A = 77°, B = 77°, C = 26°
  In Theorem 1 we assumed AC = BC and proved A = B. We will now assume A = B

and prove AC = BC. When the assumption and conclusion of a statement are interchanged
the result is called the converse of the original statement.

      THEOREM 2 (THE CONVERSE OF THEOREM 1)
  If two angles of a triangle are equal the sides opposite these angles are equal.
  In Figure 3, if A = B then AC = BC.

ANSWER : x = 9

Proof of Theorem  :
Draw CD the angle bisector of ACB(Figure 4). We have ACD = BCD and A = B.
We must prove AC = BC.

      THEOREM 3
  An equilateral triangle is equiangular.
  In Figure 5, if AB = AC = BC then A = B = C.

                                           Figure . ABC is eqilateral.
Proof :
AC = BC so by Theorem 1 A = B. AB = AC so by Theorem 1 B = C. Therefore A
= B = C.
Since the sum of the angle is 180° we must have in fact that A = B = C = 60°.

      THEOREM 4 (THE CONVERSE OF THEOREM 3)
  An equiangular triangle is equilateral.
  In Figure 6, if A = B = C then AB = AC = BC.

Proof :
A = B so by Theorem 2, AC = BC. B = C so by Theorem 2, AB = AC.
Therefore AB = AC = BC.

       x + 3y = 7x - y           and                         7x - 3x - y = 5

x - 7x + 3y + y = 0

       -6x + 4y = 0

We have a system of two equations in two unknowns to solve:

          HISTORICAL NOTE

  Theorem 1, the isosceles triangle theorem, is believed to have rst been proven by
Thales (c. 600 B,C,) - it is Proposition 5 in Euclid's Elements. Euclid's proof is more
complicated than ours because he did not want to assume the existence of an angle
bisector. Euclid's proof goes as follows:

 Given ABC with AC = BC (as in Figure  at the beginning of this section) extend
CA to D and CB to E so that AD = BE (Figure ). Then DCB  ECA by SAS =
SAS. The corresponding sides and angles of the congruent triangles are equal, so DB
= EA, 3 = 4 and 1 + 5 = 2 + 6. Now ADB  BEA by SAS = SAS.
This gives 5 = 6 and nally 1 = 2 .

                                Figure . The "Bridge of Fools".
 This complicated proof discouraged many students from further study in geometry
during the long period when the Elements was the standard text. Figure 7 resembles
a bridge which in the Middle Ages became known as the "bridge of fools". This was
supposedly because a fool could not hope to cross this bridge and would abandon
geometry at this point.

   2.6 THE SSS THEOREM

We now consider the case where the side of two triangles are known to be of the same
length.

      THEOREM 1 (SSS or SIDE - SIDE - SIDE THEOREM)

Two triangles are congruent if three sides of one are equal respectively to three sides of the
other( SSS = SSS ).
In Figure 1, if a = d, b = e and c = f then ABC  DEF.

                  Figure . ABC  DEF because SSS = SSS.

   EXAMPLE A
Find x, y and z:

     79°                                                y°

57°               44°  x°                                   z°

SOLUTION
AB = 7 = DF. Therefore C, the angle opposite AB must correspond to E, the angle
opposite DF. In the same way A corresponds to F and B corresponds to D. We have
ABC  FDE by SSS=SSS. So
x° = D = B = 44°
y° = F = A = 57°
z° = E = C = 79°

ANSWER : x = 44, y = 57, z = 79.

4. ABC  DEF
5. C = F.

Application:
The SSS Theorem is the basis of an important principle of construction and engineering
called triangular bracing. Imagine the line segments in Figure 3 to be beans of wood or
steel joined at the endpoints by nails or screws. If pressure is applied to one of the sides,
ABCD will collapse and look like A B C D.

                                                                              Pressure

                      Figure . ABCD collapses into ABCD when pressure is applied.

   Now suppose points A and C are joined by a new beam, called a brace (Figure 4). The
structure will not collapse as long as the beans remain unbroken and joined together. It is
impossible to deform ABCD into any other shape ABCD because if AB = AB, BC = BC
and AC = AC then ABC would be congruent to ABC by SSS = SSS.

103
                       Congruent Triangles

  Figure . ABCD cannot collapse into ABCD as long as the beams remain unbroken and joined
                                                       together.

We sometimes say that a triangle is a rigid gure. Once the sides of a triangle are xed the
angles cannot be changed. Thus in Figure 4, the shape of ABC cannot be changed as long
as the lengths of its sides remain the same.

   2.7 THE HYP - LEG THEOREM and OTHER CASES

We give one more reason for two triangles to be congruent. Note that the following reason
applies to right triangles only:

      THEOREM 1 (HYPOTENUSE - LEG THEOREM)
   Two right triangles are congruent if the hypotenuse and a leg of one triangle are respec-
tively equal to the hypotenuse and a leg of the other triangle (Hyp - Leg = Hyp - Leg).
In Figure 1, if AB = DE and BC = BF then ABC  DEF.

    90°                                                 90°

                      Figure . ABC  DEF because Hyp - Leg = Hyp - Leg.

   EXAMPLE A
Find x and y:

                               y°
                                                                                  90°

x°  90°  44°                                                 46°

SOLUTION
  The hypotenuse of ABC = AB = hypotenuse of DBF = DF.
  A leg of ABC = AC = A leg of DEF = DE. Therefore
  ABC  DFE by Hyp - Leg = Hyp - Leg. So
  x° = A = D = 44°, y° = B = F = 46°.

ANSWER : x = 44, y = 46

                                                Congruent Triangles

Proof of Theorem :
In Figure 1, place DEF so that BC and EF coincide (see Figure 2). Then ACD = 180° so
AD is a straight line segment. ABD is isosceles with AB = DE. Therefore A = D because
they are the base angles of isosceles triangle ABD (Theorem 1, section2.5).
Then ABC  DEF by AAS = AAS.

                         Congruent Triangles

   At this point the student might be ready to conclude that two triangles are congruent
whenever any three corresponding sides or angles are equal. However this is not true in the
following two cases:

1. There may be two triangles that are not congruent but have two equal sides and an equal
     unincluded angle (SSA = SSA).
    In Figure 3, AC = DF, BC = BF and A = D but none of the other angles or sides are
    equal.

                    86°                                 34°

                  Figure . These two triangles satisfy SSA = SSA but are not congruent.

2. There are many triangles that are not congruent but have the same three angles.
    (AAA = AAA)
    In Figure 4, the corresponding angles are equal but the corresponding sides are not.

                                                   85°

                    Figure . These triangles satisfy AAA = AAA but are not congruent.

If AAA = AAA the triangles are sald to be similar. Similar triangles are discussed in
Chapter 4.

   EXAMPLE C
Determine if the triangles are congruent. If so write the congruence statement and nd x.

         Congruent Triangles

SOLUTION

From the diagram AC = BC, CD = CD, and A = B. These are the only pairs of sides and
angles which can be proven equal. A is not included between sides AC and CD and B is
not included between sides BC and CD. Therefore we have only SSA = SSA. We cannot
conclude the triangles are congruent and we cannot nd x.

ANSWER : The triangles cannot be proven congruent.

           QUADRILATERALS

  3.1 PARALLELOGRAMS

A polygon is a gure formed by line segments which bound a portion of the plane (Figure
1). The bounding line segments are called the sides of the polygon. The angles formed by
the sides are the angles of the polygon and the vertices of these angles are the vertices of
the polygon. The simplest polygon is the triangle, which has 3 sides. In this chapter we will
study the quadrilateral, the polygon with 4 sides (Figure 2). Other polygons are the
pentagon (5 sides), the hexagon(6 sides), the octagon(8 sides) and the decagon (10 sides).

   A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which the opposite sides are parallel (Figure 3). To

discover its properties, we will draw a diagonal, a line connecting the opposite vertices of

the parallelogram. In Figure 4, AC is a diagonal of parallelogram ABCD . We will now
prove ABC  CDA:

We have proved the following theorem:

  THEOREM 1

In parallelogram ABCD of Figure 5, AB = CD, AD = BC, A = C, and B = D.

                             120°          60°

SOLUTION
By Theorem 1, the opposite sides and opposite angles are equal.
Hence x° = 120°, y° = 60°, r = 15 and s = 10.

ANSWER : x = 120, y = 60, r = 15, s = 10.

                     z° 30° w°

SOLUTION

w° = 115° since the opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.
x° = 180° - (w° + 30°) = 180° - (115° + 30°) = 180° - 145° = 35°, because the sum of
the angles of ABC is 180°, y° = 30° and z° = x° = 35° because they are alternate interior
angles of parallel lines.

ANSWER : w = 115, x = z = 35, y = 30.

   3.2 OTHER QUADRILATERALS

In this section we will consider other quadrilaterals with special properties: the rhombus, the
rectangle, the square and the trapezoid.

    A rhombus is a parallelogram in which all sides are equal (Figure 1). It has all the

properties of a parallelogram plus some additional ones as well. Let us draw the diagonals
AC and BD (Figure 2). By Theorem 3 of section 3.1 the diagonals bisect each other. Hence
ADE  CDE  CBE  ABE by SSS = SSS. The corresponding angles of the

congruent triangles are equal:

1 = 2 = 3 = 4, 5 = 6 = 7 = 8 and 9 = 10 = 11 = 12. 9 and 10 are

supplementary in addition to being equal, hence 9 = 10 = 11 = 12 = 90°. We have

proven the following theorem:

   THEOREM 1
The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect the angles. See Figure 3.

                                                        90°

                     40°

SOLUTION

ABCD is a rhombus since it is a parallelogram all of whose sides equal 6. According to
Theorem 1, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect the angles. Therefore w° = 40°
since AC bisects BAD. AED = 90° so x° = 180° - (90° + 40°) = 180° - 130° = 50° (the
sum of the angles of AED is 180°).
Finally y° = w° = 40° (compare with Figure 3) and z° = x° = 50°.

ANSWER : w = 40, x = 50, y = 40, z = 50

                                          angle must also be a rectangle.

   THEOREM 2

A parallelogram with just one right angle must be a rectangle.
In Figure 6, if A is a right angle then all the other angles must be right angles too.

Proof :
In Figure 6, C = A = 90° because the opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal
(Theorem 1, Section .). B = 90° and D = 90° because the successive angles of a
parallelogram are supplementary (Theorem 2, Section .1).

                                                      40°

SOLUTION
By Theorem 2, ABCD is a rectangle. x° = 40° because alternate interior angles of parallel
lines AB and CD must be equal.
Since the gure is a rectangle, BCD = 90° and y° = 90° - x° = 90° - 40° = 50°.
ANSWER : x = 40, y = 50

   We will show ABC  BAD. AB = BA because of identity. A = B = 90°. BC = AD
because the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. Then ABC  BAD by SAS =
SAS. Therefore diagonal AC = diagonal BD because they are corresponding sides of
congruent triangles. We have proven:

     THEOREM 3
  The diagonals of a rectangle are equal. In Figure 7, AC = BD.

      EXAMPLE C
 Find w, x, y, z, AC and BD:

SOLUTION
x = 3 because the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
So AC = 3 + 3 = 6. BD = AC = 6 since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal (Theorem 3).
Therefore y = z = 3 since diagonal BD is bisected by diagonal AC.
ANSWER : x = y = z = 3 and AC = BD = 6.

SOLUTION

x° = 35°, because alternate interior angles of parallel lines are equal. y° = x° = 35° because
they are base angles of isosceles triangle ABE (AE = BE because the diagonals of a rectangle
are equal and bisect each other).
z° = 180° - (x° + y°) = 180° - (35° + 35°) = 180° - 70° = 110°.

  A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with two and only two sides parallel. The parallel sides are
called bases and the other two sides are called legs. In Figure 10, AB and CD are the bases
and AD and BC are the legs. A and B are a pair of base angles. C and D are another
pair of base angles.

                                             Figure . A trapezoid.

  An isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid in which the legs are equal. In Figure 11, ABCD is
an isosceles trapezoid with AD = BC. An isosceles trapezoid has the following property:

     THEOREM 4

  The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are equal.

SOLUTION
x° = 55° because A and B, the base angles of isosceles trapezoid ABCD, are equal. Now
the interior angles of parallel lines on the same side of the transversal are supplementary
(Theorem 3, section .).
Therefore y° = 180° - x° = 180° - 55° = 125° and z° = 180° - 55° = 125°.
ANSWER : x = 55, y = z = 125
Proof of Theorem :
Draw DE parallel to CB as in Figure 12. 1 = B because corresponding angles of parallel
lines are equal. DE = BC because they are the opposite sides of parallelogram BCDE.
Therefore AD = DE. So ADE is isosceles and its base angles, A and 1 are equal.

    We have proven A = 1 = B . To prove C = D, observe that they are both
supplements of A = B (Theorem 3, Section .).
The isosceles trapezoid has one additional property:

      THEOREM 5
   The diagonals of an isosecles trapezoid are equal.
   In Figure 13, AC = BD.

                                Figure . The diagonals AC and BD are equal.
Proof: BC = AD, given. ABC = BAD because they are the base angles of isosceles
trapezoid ABCD (Theorem 4). AB = BA, identity. Therefore ABC  BAD by SAS = SAS.
So AC = BD because they are corresponding sides of the congruent triangles.

                        SIMILAR TRIANGLES

4.1 PROPORTIONS

In our discussion of similar triangles the idea of a proportion will play an important role. In
this section we will review the important properties of proportions.

A proportion is an equation which states that two fractions are equal. For example
is a proportion. We sometimes say "2 is to 6 as 4 is to 12 ."
This is also written 2 : 6 = 4 : 12. The extremes of this proportion are the numbers 2 and
12 and the means are the numbers 6 and 4. Notice that the product of the means 6×4=24
is the same as the product of the extremes 2 × 12 = 24.

     THEOREM 1

If a = c then ad = bc. Conversely, if ad = bc then a = c .
     bd                                                bd

(The product of the means is equal to the product of the extremes).

Examples
2 = 4 and 2 × 12 = 6 × 4 are both true.
6 12
2 = 6 and 2 × 9 = 3 × 6 are both true.
39
1 = 4 and 1 × 12 = 4 × 4 are both false.
4 12

Proof of Theorem  :

If a = c , multiply both sides of the equation by bd:
    bd

                     a (bd) = c (bd)
                     b  d

137
                                                  Similar Triangles

We obtain ad = bc.
Conversely, if ad = bc, divide both sides of the equation by bd:

                        ad = bc
                       (bd) (bd)
The result is a = c .
                  bd

  The following theorem shows that we can interchange the means or the extremes or both
of them simultaneously and still have a valid proportion:

     THEOREM 2
 If one of the following is true then they are all true:
 (1) a = c

       bd
 (2) a = b

       cd
 (3) d = c

       ba
 (4) cd = ab

Proof :
If any of these proportions is true then ad = bc by Theorem 1. The remaining proportions
can be obtained from ad = bc by dvision, as in Theorem 1.
Example :
2 = 4 , 2 = 6 , 12 = 4 , 12 = 6 are all true because 2 × 12 = 6 × 4.
6 12 4 12 6 2 4 2

                                                                                                                    138

The process of converting a proportion 2 = 4 to the equivalent equation 2 × 12 = 6 × 4
                                                 6 12

is sometimes called cross multiplication.
The idea is conveyed by the following notation:

                   2        4

                   6       12

     x - 1 = 2x + 2

(x - 1)(x + 1) = (x - 3)(2x + 2)   x = 5:                   2x + 2 = 2(5) + 2 = 12 = 2
          x2 - 1 = 2x2 - 4x - 6    x-1 = 5-1= 4 =2           x+1 5+1 6

                                   x = -1:                        x + 1 -1 + 1 0
0 = x-5            0 = x+1         x - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2 = 1   ANSWER : x = 5.

   4.2 SIMILAR TRIANGLES

Two triangles are said to be similar if they have equal sets of angles. In Figure 1, ABC is
similar to DEF. The angles which are equal are called corresponding angles. In Figure 1,
A corresponds to D, B corresponds to E and C corresponds to F. The sides joining
corresponding vertices are called corresponding sides. In Figure 1, AB corresponds to DE,
BC corresponds to EF, and AC corresponds to DF. The symbol for similar is . The
similarity statement ABC  DEF will always be written so that corresponding vertices
appear in the same order.

  For the triangles in Figure 1, we could also write BAC  EDF or ACB  DFE but
never ABC  EDF nor ACB  DEF.

                                             110°

          110°

     40°        30°       40°                                30°

                                    Figure . ABC is similar to DEF.

   We can tell which sides correspond from the similarity statement. For example, if
ABCDEF, then side AB corresponds to side DE because both are the rst two
letters. BC corresponds to EF because both are the last two letters, AC corresponds to
DF because both consist of the rst and last letters.

       EXAMPLE A

    Determine if the triangles are similar, and if so, write the similarity statement:

                                             45°

          65°        45°                           65°

SOLUTION

C = 180° - (65° + 45°) = 180° - 110° = 70°.
D = 180° - (65° + 45°) = 180° - 110° = 70°.
Therefore both triangles have the same angles and ABC  EFD.

ANSWER : ABC  EFD

                                                  Similar Triangles
   Example A suggests that to prove similarity it is only necessary to know that two of the
corresponding angles are equal:

      THEOREM 1
  Two triangles are similar if two angles of one equal two angles of the other (AA = AA).
  In Figure 2, ABC  DEF because A = D and B = E.

                                   Figure . ABC  DEF because AA = AA.
Proof:
C = 180° - (A + B) = 180° - (D + E) = F .

       EXAMPLE B
   Determine which triangles are similar and write a similarity statement:

SOLUTION
A = CDE because they are corresponding angles of parallel lines. C = C because of
identity. Therefore ABC  DEC by AA = AA.
ANSWER : ABC  DEC.

                                                                                                                   142
                                                  Similar Triangles

       EXAMPLE C
   Determine which triangles are similar and write a similarity statement:

SOLUTION
A = A identity. ACB = ADC = 90°. Therefore

Also B = B identity. BDC = BCA = 90°. Therefore

ANSWER : ABC  ACD  CBD
Similar triangIes are important because of the following theorem:

      THEOREM 2
  The corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.
  This means that if ABC  DEF then

                                             AB = BC = AC
                                            DE EF DF
  That is, the rst two letters of ABC are to the rst two letters of DEF as the last two
  letters of ABC are to the last two letters of DEF as the rst and last letters of ABC
  are to the rst and last letters of DEF.
   Before attempting to prove Theorem 2, we will give several examples of how it is used:

ANSWER : x = 18 feet
Proof of Theorem  (The corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional):
We illustrate the proof using the triangles of Example D (Figure 3). The proof for other
similar triangles follows the same pattern.
Here we will prove that x = 12 so that 2 = 8 .

   First draw lines parallel to the sides of ABC and DEF as shown in Figure 4. The
corresponding angles of these parallel lines are equal and each of the parallelograms with a
side equal to 1 has its opposite side equal to 1 as well. Therefore all of the small triangles
with a side equal to 1 are congruent by AAS = AAS.

                  Figure . Draw lines parallel to the sides of ABC and DEF.
   The corresponding sides of these triangles form side BC = 8 of ABC (see Figure 5).
Therefore each of these sides must equal 4 and x = EF = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 (Figure 6).

Figure 5. The small triangles are congruent  Figure . The small triangles of DEF are
hence the corresponding sides lying on BC    congruent to the small triangles of ABC hence x
must each be equal to 4.
                                             = EF = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

Note to instructor:
This proof can be carried out whenever the lengths of the sides of the triangles are rational
numbers. However, since irrational numbers can be approximated as closely as necessary by
rationals, the proof extends to that case as well.

               HISTORICAL NOTE

        Thales (c. 600 B.C.) used the proportionality of sides of similar triangles to
     measure the heights of the pyramids in Egypt. His method was much like the one we
     used in Example H to measure the height of trees.

          Figure . Using similar triangles to measure the height of a pyramid.

     In Figure 7, DE represent the height of the pyramid and CE is the length of its

     shadow. BC represents a vertical stick and AC is the length of its shadow. We have

     ABC  CDE. Thales was able to measure directly the lengths AC, BC and CE.

     Substituting these values in the proportion BC = AC , he was able to nd the height

now extend the denition to a line which intersects three other lines. In Figure 1, AB is a
transversal to three lines.

  If the three lines are parallel and we have two such transversals we may state the following
theorem:

   4.4 PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
In a right triangle, the sides of the right angle are called the legs of the triangle and the
remaining side is called the hypotenuse.
In Figure 1, side AC and BC are the legs and side AB is the hypotenuse.

  The following is one of the most famous theorems in mathematics:

      THEOREM 1 (PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM)
  In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the
  legs. That is,

                                          leg2 + leg2 = hypotenuse2

    THEOREM 1 (PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM)
In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the
legs. That is,

                                       leg2 + leg2 = hypotenuse2
In Figure 1, a2 + b2 = c2.

                                                                                   c - x

Proof:
In Figure 1, draw CD perpendicular to AB. Let x = AD. Then BD = c - x (Figure 2). As in
Example C, section 4.2, ABC  ACD and ABC  CBD. From these two similarities

we obtain two proportions:

ABC  ACD                        ABC  ACD

     AB = AC                        AB = BC

      c =b
      bx                             ac = c - x a
     cx = b2                    c(c - x) = a2
                                c2 - cx = a2
                                 c2 - b2 = a2

                                      c2 = a2 + b2

     THEOREM 2 (converse of the Pythagorean Theorem)
 In a triangle, if the square of one side is equal to the sun of the squares of the other two
 sides then the triangle is a right triangle.
 In Figure 3, if c2 = a2 + b2 then ABC is a right triangle with C = 90° .

                               Figure . If c2 = a2 + b2 then C = 90°.
Proof:
Draw a new triangle, DEF so that F = 90°, d = a and e = b (Figure 4). DEF is a right
triangle, so by Theorem 1, f2 = d2 + e2. We have f2 = d2 + e2 = a2 + b2 = c2 and therefore
f = c. Therefore ABC  DEF because SSS = SSS. Therefore, C = F = 90°:

                                                                                                90°

              HISTORICAL NOTE

        Pythagoras (c. 582 - 507 B.C.) was not the rst to discover the theorem which
     bears his name. It was known long before his time by the Chinese, the Babylonians
     and perhaps also the Egyptians and the Hindus. According to tradition, Pythagoras
     was the rst to give a proof of the theorem. His proof probably made use of areas,
     like the one suggested in Figure 5 below. (Each square contains four congruent right
     triangles with

                       Figure . Pythagoras may have proved a2 + b2 = c2 in this way.
     sides of lengths a, b and c. In addition the square on the left contains a square with
     side a and a square with side b while the one on the right contains a square with
     side c.) Since the time of Pythagoras, at least several hundred dierent proofs of the
     Pythagorean Theorem have been proposed. Pythagoras was the founder of the
     Pythagorean school, a secret religious society devoted to the study of philosophy,
     mathematics and science. Its membership was a select group, which tended to keep
     the discoveries and practices of the society secret from outsiders. The Pythagoreans
     believed that numbers were the ultimate components of the universe and that all
     physical relationships could be expressed with whole numbers. This belief was
     prompted in part by their discovery that the notes of the musical scale were related
     by numerical ratios. The Pythagoreans made important contributions to medicine,
     physics, and astronomy. In geometry, they are credited with the angle sum theorem
     for triangles, the properties of parallel lines and the theory of similar triangles and
     proportions.

   4.5 SPECIAL RIGHT TRIANGLES

There are two kinds of right triangle which deserve special attention: the 30°- 60°- 90° right
triangle and the 45° - 45°- 90° right triangle.
A triangle whose angles are 30°, 60° and 90° is called a 30° - 60° - 90° triangle. ABC in
Figure 1 is a 30° - 60° - 90° triangle with side AC = 1.

  To learn more about this triangle let us draw lines BD and CD as in Figure 2.
ABC  DBC by ASA = ASA so AC = DC = 1. ABD is an equiangular triangle so all
the sides must be equal to 2. Therefore AB = 2 (Figure 3).

leg2 + leg2 = hyp2

     12 + x2 = 22

   Now suppose we are given another 30° - 60° - 90° triangle DEF, with side DF = 8

  Our conclusions about triangles ABC and DEF suggest the following theorem:

     THEOREM 1

 In the 30° - 60° - 90° triangle the hypotenuse is always twice as large as the leg opposite
 the 30° angle (the shorter leg). The leg opposite the 60° angle (the longer leg) is always
 equal to the shorter leg times 3 .

               30°

                                                      60° 90°

  Figure . The hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg and the longer leg is equal to the shorter
              leg times the 3.

In Figure 5, s = shorter leg, L = longer leg and hyp = hypotenuse. Theorem 1 says that

                                              hyp = 2s
                                                 L = s3

   Note that the longer leg is always the leg opposite (furthest away from) the 60° angle and
the shorter leg is always the leg opposite (furthest away from) the 30° angle.

                                                                                                                     172

           45°      90°                                   45°          90°

Figure . A 45° - 45° - 90° triangIe.       Figure . The legs of 45° - 45° - 90°
                                                       triangle are equal.

Since A = B = 45°, the sides opposite these angles must be equal (Theorem 2, Section
.). Therefore AC = BC = 1. Let x = AB (Figure 7). By the Pythagorean Theorem,

                                      leg2 + leg2 = hyp2
                                          12 + 12 = x2
                                           1 + 1 = x2
                                                 2 = x2

                                                2 = x

EXAMPLE C

Find x:

                                      45°  90°

SOLUTION

B = 180° - (45° + 90°) = 180° - 135° = 45°. So ABC is a 45° - 45° - 90° triangle.
AC = BC = 8 because these sides are opposite equal angles. By the Pythagorean Theorem,

leg2 + leg2 = hyp2

  82 + 82 = x2
64 + 64 = x2

     128 = x2

128 = x x = 128 = 642 = 82                                ANSWER : 82

  The triangles of Figure 6 and Example C suggest the following theorem:

     THEOREM 2
 In the 45° - 45° - 90° triangle the legs are equal and the hypotenuse is equal to either leg
 times 2.
In Figure 8, hyp is the hypotenuse and L is the length of each leg. Theorem 2 says that.

               hyp = L2     45°

                                L                                      hyp = L2

SOLUTION
B = 45°. So ABC is an isosceles                       4 = x2
right triangle and x = y.                             4 = x2

        2x2 = 16

    EXAMPLE E
Find AB:

               45°

SOLUTION
ADE is a 45° - 45° - 90° triangle. Hence

hyp = L2

10 = x2        x = 10 = 10 . 2 = 102 = 52  AE = x = 52

Now draw CF perpendicular to AB (Figure 9). B = 45° since ABCD is an isosceles
trapezoid (Theorem 4, Section .).

                                            x = 52

                                     Figure . Draw CF perpendicular to AB.
So BCF is a 45° - 45° - 90° triangle congruent to ADE and therefore BF = 52. CDEF
is a rectangle and therefore EF = 10.
We have AB = AE + EF + FB = 52 + 10 + 52 = 102 + 10

ANSWER : AB = 102 + 10

Find AC and BD:

SOLUTION

ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular and bisect each other.
AEB = 90° and ABE = 180° - (90° + 30°) = 60°. So AEB is a 30° - 60° - 90° triangle.

hyp = 2s          L = s3
  4 = 2(BE)      AE = 23
  2 = BE         AC = 23 + 23

          HISTORICAL NOTE

The Pythagoreans believed that all physical relation ships could be expressed with
whole numbers. However the sides of the special triangles described in this section
are related by irrational numbers, 2 and 3. An irrational number is a number
which can be approximated, but not expressed exactly, by a ratio of whole numbers.
For example 2 can be approximated with increasing accuracy by such ratios as

etc., but there is no fraction of whole numbers which is exactly equal to 2. (For
more details and a proof, see the book by Richardson listed in the References). The

Pythagoreans discovered that 2 was irrational in about the 5th century B.C. It was
a tremendous shock to them that not all triangles could be measured "exactly." They
may have even tried to keep this discovery a secret for fear of the damage it would
do to their philosophical credibility.

   The inability of the Pythagoreans to accept irrational numbers had unfortunate
consequences for the development of mathematics. Later Greek mathematicians
avoided giving numerical values to lengths of line segments. Problems whose
algebraic solutions might be irrational numbers, such as those involving quadratic
equations, were instead stated and solved geometrically. The result was that
geometry ourished at the expense of algebra. It was left for the Hindus and the
Arabs to resurrect the study of algebra in the Middle Ages. And it was not until the
19th century that irrational numbers were placed in the kind of logical framework
that the Greeks had given to geometry 2000 years before.

   4.6 DISTANCE FROM A POINT TO A LINE
Suppose we are given a point P and a line AB as in Figure 1. We would like to nd the
shortest line segment that can be drawn from P to AB.

                                          Figure . Point P and line AB.
First we will prove a theorem:

      THEOREM 1
  In a right triangle the hypotenuse is larger than either leg. In Figure 2, c > a and c > b.
  (The symbol ">" means "is greater than.")

                               Figure . c is larger than either a or b.
Proof :
By the Pythagorean Theorem,
 c2 = a2 + b2 > a2 = a
 c2 = a2 + b2 > b2 = b
Now we can give the answer to our question:

                                                                                                                     182

    THEOREM 2
The perpendicular is the shortest line segment that can be drawn from a point to a
straight line.
In Figure 3 the shortest line segment from P to AB is PD. Any other line segment, such
as PC, must be longer.

                        Figure . PD is the shortest line segment from P to AB.

Proof :
PC is the hypotenuse of right triangle PCD. Therefore by Theorem 1, PC > PD.
We dene the distance from a point to a line to be the length of the perpendicular.

  TRIGONOMETRY OF THE RIGHT TRIANGLE

  5.1 THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Trigonometry (from Greek words meaning triangle-measure)is the branch of mathematics
concerned with computing unknown sides and angles of triangles. For example, in Figure
1, we might want to measure the height of the tree without actually having to climb the
tree. The methods of trigonometry will enable us to do this.

     Figure . Trigonometry will enable us to measure the height of the tree without actually
                                               climbing the tree.

  In this book we will consider just the trigonometry of the right triangle. In more advanced
courses, trigonometry deals with other kinds of triangles as well. Here, however, the
following denitions apply only to right triangles.

  In right triangle ABC of Figure 2, AC is called the leg adjacent to A. "Adjacent" means
"next to." BC is called the leg opposite A. "Opposite" here means "furthest away from."

tangent A =  leg opposite A                   (tan A = opp )
             leg adjacent to A                             adj

   Notice that the answers to Example D and Example E were the same. This is because
A = D = 30°. The values of the trigonometric functions for all 30° angles will be the
same. The reason is that all right triangles with a 30° angle are similar. Therefore their sides
are proportional and the trigonometric ratios are equal. What holds for 30° angles holds for
other acute angles as well. We state this in the following theorem:

    THEOREM 1

The values of the trigonometric functions for equal angles are the same.
In Figure 3, if A = D = x° then sin A =sin D, cos A = cos D and tan A = tan D.

                            Trigonometry of the Right Triangle

Proof :
A = D = x° and C = F = 90° so ABC ~ DEF by AA = AA. Therefore

BC = AB and AC = AB and BC = AC .
EF DE               DF DE          EF DF

By Theorem 2, Section ., we may interchange the means of each proportion:

BC = EF and AC = DF and BC = EF .
AB DE               AB DE          AC DF

These proportions just state that
sin A = sin D and cos A = cos D and tan A = tan D.

    Theorem 1 tells us that the trigonometric functions do not depend on the particular
triangle chosen, only on the number of degrees in the angle. If we want to nd the
trigonometric values of an angle, we may chose any right triangle containing the angle which
is convenient to use.

5.2 SOLUTION OF RIGHT TRIANGLES

In the preceding section we showed that all 30° angles have the same trigonometric values. If

we compute each of these values to four decimal places, we obtain sin30° = 1 = 0.5000,
cos30° = 3 = 1.73205 = 0.8660 and tan 30° = 3 = 1.73205 2 = 0.5774. These

numbers appear in the table of trigonometric values on page 303 in the row corresponding

to 30°. As you can see, this table contains the trigonometric values of angles from 1° to 90°.

It is impractical to compute most of these values directly, so we will use this table when we

need them. A calculator with trigonometric functions may also be used.

   EXAMPLE A
Find sin 20°, cos 20° and tan 20°.

   If you are using a calculator, rst make sure that it is in degree mode. Then type the sin,
cos or tan key followed by 20. Some calculators might require you to enter the 20 rst
followed by the sin, cos or tan key.

SOLUTION
We wish to nd the leg opposite 20° and we know the hypotenuse. We use the sine because
it is the only one of the three trigonometric functions which involves both the opposite leg
and the hypotenuse.

                       Trigonometry of the Right Triangle

SOLUTION

We know the leg opposite A and we wish to nd the leg adjacent to A . We therefore use
the tangent.

        tan 20° = opp
                       adj

        0.3640 = 10
                        x

  (x)(0.3640) = 10 (x)
                        x

      0.3640x = 10

      0.3640x = 10
       0.3640 0.3640

              x = 10 = 27.47
                      0.3640

ANSWER : x = 27.5.
There is an easier method to solve Example D. B = 90° - 20° = 70° The leg opposite B
is x and the leg adjacent to B is 10.

tan 70° = opp          (2.7475)(10) = x
              adj             27.475 = x
                                 27.5 = x
2.7475 = x
              10

This method is easier because it involves multiplication rather than long division.

     sin x° = 2 = 0.6667
                 3

In the table we look in the sine column for the value closest to 0.6667:

Angle  Sine

41°    0.6561

42°    0.6691

.      .

0.6667 is closest to 0.6691 because 0.6691 - 0.6667 = 0.0024 whereas 0.6667 - 0.6561 =
0.0106. Therefore x° = 42°, to the nearest degree.

  If you are using a calculator, you will need to use the INV, SHIFT, or 2nd key followed by
the sin key, depending on the calculator, followed by 2/3. Some calculators might have a
built in sine inverse key. Some calculators might require you to enter the 2/3 rst.

            7.3 = x              3.3808 = AD

Since AC = BC = 8 we have A = B = 65°. Therefore BD = AD = 3.3808.
y = AD + BD = 3.3808 + 3.3808 = 6.7616 = 6.8.

ANSWER : x = 7.3, y = 6.8.

                                       Trigonometry of the Right Triangle

              HISTORICAL NOTE

       The rst table of trigonometric values was constructed by the Greek astronomer
     Hipparchus (c.180 - 125 B.C.). Hipparchus assumed the vertex of each angle to be
     the center of a circle, as AOB is shown to be in the circle of Figure 1. Depending
     on the number of degrees in AOB, his table would give the length of the chord AB
     relative to the radius of the circle. Today we would measure AOC instead of
     AOB and use the half chord AC instead of AB. The ratio AC/AO is then just the
     sine of AOC.

       Figure . The table of Hipparchus gave the length of the chord AB relative to the radius
                                              AO for each angle AOB.

      Hipparchus obtained some of the values for his table from the properties of special
     geometric gures, such as the 30°-60°-90° triangle and the 45°-45°-90° triangle.
     The rest of the values were obtained from those already known by using
     trigonometric identities and approximation. The identities he used were essentially
     the half-angle and sum and dierence formulas which students encounter in modern
     trigonometry courses.

       The trigonometry of the Greeks and later of the Hindus and the Arabs, was based
     primarily on the sine function. The Hindus replaced the table of chords of
     Hipparchus with a table of half chords. The term sine is derived from a Hindu word
     meaning "half-chord."

          Gradually the right triangle replaced the chords of circles as the basis of
     trigonometric denitions. The cosine is just the sine of the complement of the angle
     in a right triangle. For example the complement of 60° is 30° and cos 60° = sin 30°
     = 0.5.

        A tangent is a line which touches a circle at only one point (see Chapter 7). In
     trigonometry it refers to just that part of the tangent line intercepted by the angle,
     relative to the radius of the circle. In Figure 2 the tangent of DOE is the segment
     DE divided by the radius OD.

199
                                  Trigonometry of the Right Triangle

    The ancient Greeks were probably aware of the tangent function but the rst
known table of values was constructed by the Arabs in 10th century. The term
"tangent" was adopted in the 16th century.

                             Figure . The tangent of DOE is DE/OD.
   Modern trigonometric tables are constructed from innite series. These were rst
discovered in the 17th century by Newton, Leibniz and others. For example the
innite series for the sine function is
  sine x = x - x3 + x5 - x7 + . . .

                     6 120 5040
where x is in radians, 1 radian = 57.296 degrees. A good approximation of the sine
of an angle can be obtained from the innite series by summing just the rst few
terms. This is also the method computers and calculators use to nd trigonometric
values. The derivation of these formulas is found in calculus textbooks.

                                                                                                               200

   5.3 APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY

Trigonometry has many applications in science and engineering. In this section we will
present just a few examples from surveying and navigation.

   The angle made by the line of sight of an observer on the ground to a point above the
horizontal is called the angle of elevation. In Figure 1, BAC is the angle of elevation.

                                                                                      B

SOLUTION
Let x = height of tree.

       tan 43° = x
                     50

       0.9325 = x
                     50

 (50) 0.9325 = x (50)
                     50

     46.6250 = x
          46.6 = x

ANSWER : x = 46.6 feet.

  The angle made by the line of sight of an observer above to a point on the ground is called
the angle of depression. In Figure 2 ABD is the angle of depression.

 CHAPTER 6

               AREA AND PERIMETER

   6.1 THE AREA OF A RECTANGLE AND SQUARE
The measurement of the area of geometric gures is one of the most familiar ways
mathematics is used in our daily lives. The oor space of a building, the size of a picture,
the amount of paper in a roll of paper towels are all examples of items often measured in
terms of area. In this chapter we will derive formulas for the areas of the geometric objects
which we have studied.

   Area is measured in square inches, square feet, square centimeters, etc. The basic unit of
measurement is the unit square, the square whose sides are of length 1 (Figure 1). Its area
is 1 square inch, 1 square foot, 1 square centimeter, etc., depending on which measurement
of Iength is chosen. The area of any closed gure is dened to be the number of unit
squares it contains.

                                             Figure . The unit square.

       EXAMPLE A
   Find the area of a rectangle with length 5 and width 3.
SOLUTION
We see from the diagram that
the area is (5)(3) = 15.
ANSWER : 15.

  209
                                                 Area and Perimeter

This suggests the following theorem:
      THEOREM 1

  The area of a rectangle is the length times its width.
                                                   A = lw

       EXAMPLE B
   Find the area of a square with side 3.
SOLUTION
Area = (3)(3) = 32 = 9.
ANSWER : 9.

The formula for a square is now self-evident:
      THEOREM 2

  The area of a square is the square of one of its sides.
                                                   A = s

The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides. For instance the perimeter
of the rectangle of Example A would be 5 + 5 + 3 + 3 = 16.

       EXAMPLE C
   Find the area and perimeter of rectangle ABCD:

                                                                                                                     210
                                     Area and Perimeter

SOLUTION

We rst use the Pythagorean Theorem to nd x:

        AB2 + BC2 = AC2
(3x - 1)2 + (2x)2 = (2x + 4)2

9x2 - 6x + 1 + 4x2 = 4x2 + 16x + 16
    9x2 - 22x - 15 = 0
   (9x + 5)(x - 3) = 0

9x + 5 = 0 x - 3 = 0

          x =- 5      x =3
                   9

We reject the answer x = - 5 because BC = 2x = 2(- 5 ) = - 10 would have negative
length. Therefore x = 3. 9                               9  9

AB = 3x - 1 = 3(3) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8.   BC = 2x = 2(3) = 6
AC = 2x + 4 = 2(3) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

CHECK :

  AB2 + BC2 = AC2
       82 + 62 102
      64 + 36 100
           100

Area = l . w = (8)(6) = 48.

Perimeter = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28.

ANSWER : Area = 48, Perimeter = 28.

   40 = (x2 + 3x)                              Area = l . w
    0 = x2 + 3x - 40                            40 (x + 3)(x)
    0 = (x - 5)(x + 8)                          40 (5 + 3)(5)
    0 = x-5 x=-8                                40 (8)(5)

We reject x = -8 because side BC = x of                  40
the rectangle would be negative.
                                                                  ANSWER : x = 5.

                 = 164 square feet

ANSWER : 164.

          HISTORICAL NOTE

The need to measure land areas was one of the ancient problems which led to the
development of geometry. Both the early Egyptians and Babylonians had formulas
for the areas of rectangles, triangles and trapezoids, but some of their formulas were
not entirely accurate. The formulas in this chapter were known to the Greeks and
are found in Euclid's Elements.

   6.2 THE AREA OF A PARALELLOGRAM
In parallelogram ABCD of Figure 1, side AB is called the base and the line segment DE is
called the height or altitude. The base may be any side of the parallelogram, though it is
usually chosen to be the side on which the parallelogram appears to be resting. The height is
a line drawn perpendicular to the base from the opposite side.

                  Figure . Parallelogram ABCD with base b and height h.

      THEOREM 1
  The area of a parallelogram is equal to its base times its height.

                                                   A = bh
Proof :
Draw BF and CF as shown in Figure 2. A = CBF, AED = F = 90° and AD = BC.
Therefore ADE  BCF and the area of ADE equals the area of BCF. We have:
Area of parallelogram ABCD = Area of ADE + Area of trapezoid BCDE

                                    = Area of BCF + Area of trapezoid BCDE

   6.3 THE AREA OF A TRIANGLE

For each of the triangles in Figure 1, side AB is called the base and CD is called the height
or altitude drawn to this base. The base can be any state of the triangle though it is usually
chosen to be the side on which the triangle appears to be resting. The height is the line
drawn perpendicular to the base from the opposite vertex. Note that the height may fall
outside the triangle, if the triangle is obtuse, and that the height may be one of the legs, if the
triangle is a right triangle.

            Figure . Triangles with base b and height h.

    THEOREM 1
The area of a triangle is equal to one-half of its base times its height.

                                               A = 1 bh
                                                     2

Proof :

For each of the triangles illustrated in Figure 1, draw AE and CE so that ABCE is a

parallelogram (Figure 2). ABC  CEA so area of ABC = area of CEA. Therefore
area of ABC = 1 area of parallelogram ABCE = 1 bh.

   6.4 THE AREA OF A RHOMBUS

The area of a rhombus can be found by using the formula for the area of a parallelogram,
A = bh, since a rhombus is a special kind of parallelogram (Figure 1). However if the
diagonals are known the following formula can be used instead (see Figure 2):

               Figure .                     Figure .                     1 d1d2.
The area of Rhombus ABCD is bh.
                                            The area of rhombus ABCD is 2

    THEOREM 1
The area of a rhombus is one-half the product of the diagonals.

                                              A = 12 d1d2

     EXAMPLE A
Find the area of the rhombus:

SOLUTION                                                                   ANSWER : 24.
Area = 12 d1d2 = 12 (8)(6) = 12 (48) = 24.
                                                                                      228
                                                 Area and Perimeter

Proof of Theorem :
Referring to Figure 2,
Area of ABC = 12 bh = 12 (AC)(BE) = 12 d1( 12 d2) = 14 d1d2 .
Area of ADC = 12 bh = 12 (AC)(DE) = 12 d1( 12 d2) = 14 d1d2 .
Area of rhombus ABDC = Area of ABC + Area of ADC = 14 d1d2 + 14 d1d2 = 12 d1d2.

       EXAMPLE B
   Find the area and perimeter of the rhombus:

SOLUTION

The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular so CDE is a right triangle. Therefore we can

apply the Pythagorean theorem.

52 + x2 = (x + 1)2               d1 = 12 + 12 = 24.
25 + x2 = x2 + 2x + 1               d2 = 5 + 5 = 10.

     24 = 2x                    CD = x + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.

     12 = x

A = 12 d1 . d2 = 12 (24)(10) = 120.                         ANSWER : A= 120, P= 52.
Perimeter = 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 = 52.

  The area of a trapezoid is equal to one-half the product of its height and the sum of its
  bases.

                                              A = 12 h (b1 + b2)
       EXAMPLE A

Proof of Theorem :
In Figure 1 draw BD (see Figure 2). Note that CD = b2 is the base and BF = h is the height
of BCD.
Area of trapezoid ABCD = Area of ABD + Area of BCD.
Area of trapezoid ABCD = 12 b1h + 12 b2h = 12 h (b1 + b2).

CDEF is a rectangle so EF = CD = 10.
Therefore BF = AB - AF = 22 - (10 + 5) = 7. Let x = BC.

 CF2 + BF2 = BC2
  532 + 72 = x2

    75 + 49 = x2
         124 = x2
            x = 124 = 431 = 231.

Area = 12 h (b1 + b2) = 12 (53)(22 + 10) = 12 (53)(32) = 803.
Perimeter = 22 + 10 + 10 + 231 = 42 + 231.

    REGULAR POLYGONS AND CIRCLES

  7.1 REGULAR POLYGONS

A regular polygon is a polygon in which all sides are equal and all angles are equal.
Examples of a regular polygon are the equilateral triangle (3 sides), the square (4 sides), the
regular pentagon (5 sides) and the regular hexagon (6 sides). The angles of a regular
polygon can easily be found using the methods of section 1.5.

  Suppose we draw the angle bisector of each angle of a regular polygon. We will nd these
angle bisectors all meet at the same point (Figure 2).

    THEOREM 1

The angle bisectors of each angle of a regular polygon meet at the same point. This point
is called the center of the regular polygon.

   In Figure 2, O is the center of each regular polygon. The segment of each angle bisector
from the center to the vertex is called a radius. For example, OA, OB, OC, OD and OE are
the ve radii of regular pentagon ABCDE.

     THEOREM 2
 The radii of a regular polygon divide the polygon into congruent isosceles triangles. All
 the radii are equal.

  In Figure 3, radii OA, OB, OC, OD and OE divide the regular pentagon into ve isosceles
triangles with OA = OB = OC = OD = OE.

                               Figure . The ve radii of a regular pentagon.

     EXAMPLE A
Find the radius CA and the angles x°, y° and z° in the regular octagon (eight-sided gure):

                         x° 3
                        y° z°

SOLUTION

The radii divide the octagon into 8 congruent isosceles triangles. Therefore OA = OB = 3.

x° = 1 (360°) = 45°
      8

y° = z° = 1 (180° - 45°) = 1 (135°) = 67.5°  ANSWER : OA = 3, x° = 45°, y° = z° = 67.5°.

Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 appear to be true intuitively, but we verify them with a formal
proof:
Proof of Theorem  and Theorem :
We will prove these theorems for the regular pentagon. The proof for other regular
polygons is similar.
Draw the angle bisectors of A and B as in Figure 4 and call their point of intersection
O. We will show OC, OD and OE are the angle bisectors of C, D and E respectively.

Draw OC (Figure 5). AB = BC since the sides of a regular pentagon are equal. Therefore

AOB  COB by SAS = SAS. Therefore 5 = 2 = 1 of EAB = 1 of BCD. So OC
                                                    2                         2
is the angle bisector of BCD.

 Similarly we can show BOC  DOC, COD  EOD, DOE  AOE and that OD
and OE are angle bisectors. The triangles are all isosceles because their base angles are
equal. This completes the proof.

  A line segment drawn from the center perpendicular to the sides of a regular polygon is
called an apothem. (see Figure 6).

     THEOREM 3

 The apothems of a regular polygon are all equal. They bisect the sides of the regular
 polygon.

Proof of Theorem :
The apothems are all equal because they are the heights of the congruent isosceles triangles
formed by the radii (see Theorem 2). Each apothem divides the isosceles triangle into two
congruent right triangles. Therefore each apothem bisects a side of the polygon, which is
what we wanted to prove.

Figure . The apothems are the heights of the congruent isosceles triangles formed by the radii.

                             Regular Polygons and Circles

The apothem of a regular polygon is important because it is used to nd the area:
     THEOREM 4

 The area of a regular polygon is one-half the product of the apothem and the perimeter.
                                               A = 1 aP
                                                     2

EXAMPLE C

Find the area of a regular pentagon with side 20, to the nearest tenth.

SOLUTION

From Example B we know a = 13.764 . The perimeter P = (5)(20) = 100 .

Therefore A = 1 aP = 1 (13.764)(100) = 1 (1376.4) = 688.2.

Proof of Theorem :

We prove the theorem for the regular pentagon. The proof for other regular polygons is

similar.

The radii of a regular pentagon divide the regular pentagon into ve congruent triangles.
The area of each triangle is 1 as, where s is the side of the pentagon (Figure 9). Therefore,
                          2
area of the pentagon = 5( 1 as) = 1 a(5s) = 1 aP, which is the formula we wanted to
                       2     2     2
prove.

                                                   2

   To nd the perimeter of a regular polygon, all we have to do is to multiply the length of a
side by the number of sides. For example, the pentagon of Figure 8 has perimeter P = 5(20)
= 100. However it is also useful to have a formula for the perimeter when only the radius
is known:

241
                       Regular Polygons and Circles

    THEOREM 5
The perimeter of a regular polygon of n sides with radius r is given by the formula

                                             P = 2rn sin 180° n .

    EXAMPLE D
Find the perimeter of a regular pentagon with radius 10, to the nearest tenth.

SOLUTION
A pentagon has n = 5 sides. Using the formula of Theorem 5,

P = 2rn sin 180° n = 2(10)(5)sin180° 5 = 100sin36° = 100(0.5878) = 58.78 = 58.8.

ANSWER : 58.8.

Proof of Theorem :

Let us label the regular polygon as in Figure 10. Since the radii of the regular polygon
divide the polygon into n congruent triangles (Theorem 2), we have

AOB = 1 (360°) = 360°
n               n
By Theorem 3 apothem OC divides AOB into two congruent right triangles, so

AOC = 1 AOB = 1 ( 360°) = 180° .

                              Regular Polygons and Circles

Applying trigonometry to right triangle AOC we have

    180° AC
sin n = r

(r)sin 180° = AC (r)
         nr

     180°
rsin n = AC .

Since OC bisects AB,

s = 2(AC) = 2rsin180°
                           n

and therefore

P = ns = n(2r sin 180°) = 2rn sin 180°
                      n          n

which is the formula that we wish to prove.

We can also give explicit formulas for the various regular polygons, as in the following table:

      - sided gure            90 90 sin 2° = 3.141          6.282 r

      - sided gure            1000 1000 sin 0.18°= 3.1416   6.283 r

    From the table we can see that as the number of sides increases, the perimeter of a
regular polygon becomes approximately 6.28 times the radius. You may also recognize that
the value of (n sin180°)/n comes close to the number . We will return to this point when
we discuss the circumference of a circle in section 7.5.

               HISTORICAL NOTE

     In 1936 archeologists unearthed a group of ancient Babylonian tables containing
     formulas for the areas of regular polygons of three, four, ve, six and seven sides.
     There is evidence that regular polygons were commonly used in the architecture and
     designs of other ancient civilizations as well. A classical problem of Greek
     mathematics was to construct a regular polygon using just a ruler and compass.
     Regular polygons were usually studied in relationship to circles. As we shall see later
     in this chapter, the formulas for the area and perimeter of a circle can be derived
     from the corresponding formulas for regular polygons.

   7.2 CIRCLES
The circle is one of the most frequently encountered geometric gures. Wheels, rings,
phonograph records, clocks, coins are just a few examples of common objects with circular
shape. The circle has many applications in the construction of machinery and in architectural
and ornamental design.

  To draw a circle we use an instrument called a compass (Figure 1). The compass consists
of two arms, one ending in a sharp metal point and the other attached to a pencil. We draw
the circle by rotating the pencil while the metal point is held so that it does not move. The
position of the metal point is called the center of the circle. The distance between the center
and the tip of the pencil is called the radius of the circle. The radius remains the same as the
circle is drawn.

                                   Figure . Using a compass to draw a circle.
  The method of constructing a circle suggests the following denition:
A circle is a gure consisting of all points which are a given distance from a xed point
called the center. For example the circle in Figure 2 consists of all points which are a
distance of 3 from the center O. The radius is the distance of any point on the circle from
the center.

  The circle in Figure 2 has radius 3. The term radius is also used to denote any of the line
segments from a point on the circle to the center. In Figure 2, each of the line segments
OA, OB and OC is a radius. It follows from the denition of circle that all radii of a circle
are equal. So in Figure 2 the three radii OA, OB and OC are all equal to 3.

                                         Figure . A circle with radius 3.

  A circle is usually named for its center. The circle in Figure 2 is called circle O.
A chord is a line segment joining two points on a circle. In Figure 2, DE is a chord. A
diameter is a chord which passes through the center. BC is a diameter. A diameter is always
twice the length of a radius since it consists of two radii. Any diameter of circle O is equal to
6. All diameters of a circle are equal.

      EXAMPLE A

   Find the radius and diameter:

SOLUTION                   CHECK

All radii are equal so        OA =  OB

          OA = OB           2

Therefore the radius = OA = OB = 11.2 and the diameter = 2(11.2) = 22.4.

ANSWER : radius = 11.2, diameter = 22.4.
  The following three theorems show that a diameter of a circle and the perpendicular

bisector of a chord in a circle are actually the same thing.
      THEOREM 1

  A diameter perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord.
  In Figure 3, if ABCD then AE = EB.

                          Figure . The diameter CD is perpendicular to chord AB.
Proof of Theorem :
Draw OA and OB (Figure 4). OA = OB because all radii of a circle are equal. OE = OE
because of identity. Therefore AOE  BOE by Hyp-Leg = Hyp-Leg. Hence AE = BE
because they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles.

   EXAMPLE B
Find AB:

SOLUTION

Draw OA (Figure 5). OA = radius = OD = 18 + 7 = 25. AOE is a right triangle and
therefore we can use the Pythagorean theorem to nd AE :

AE2 + OE2 = OA2

  AE2 + 72 = 252
 AE2 + 49 = 625

        AE2 = 576
         AE = 24
By Theorem 1, EB = AE = 24 so AB = AE + EB = 24 + 24 = 48.
ANSWER : AB = 48.

                                                                                                                     250

    THEOREM 2
A diameter that bisects a chord which is not a diameter is perpendicular to it.
In Figure 6, if AE = EB then ABCD.

                                   Figure . Diameter CD bisects chord AB.

Proof of Theorem :
Draw OA and OB (Figure 7). OA = OB because all radii are equal, OE = OE (identity) and
AE = EB (given). Therefore AOE  BOE by SSS=SSS. Therefore AEO = BEO. Since
AEO and BEO are also supplementary we must also have AEO = BEO = 90°, which
is what we had to prove.

  In Figure 9, if CDAB and AE = EB then O must lie on CD.

            Figure . If CD is a perpendicular bisector of AB then CD must pass through O.

Proof of Theorem :
Draw a diameter FG through O perpendicular to AB at H (Figure 10). Then according to
Theorem 1 H must bisect AB . Hence H and E are the same point and FG and CD are the
same line. So O lies on CD. This completes the proof.

   EXAMPLE D
Find the radius of the circle:

SOLUTION

According to Theorem 3, O must lie on CD. Draw OA (Figure 11). Let r be the radius.
Then OA = OD = r and OE = r - 1. To nd r we apply the Pythagorean theorem to right
triangle AOE:

     AE2 + OE2 = OA2   Figure . Draw OA and let r be the radius.
  32 + (r - 1)2 = r2
9 + r2 - 2r + 1 = r2

              10 = 2r
               5 =r

ANSWER : r = 5.

      EXAMPLE E
   Find which chord, AB or CD, is larger if the radius of the circle is 25:

SOLUTION
Draw OA, OB, OC and OD(Figure 12). Each is a radius and equal to 25. We use the
Pythagorean theorem, applied to right triangle AOE , to nd AE:

     AE2 + OE2 = OA2
    AE2 + 72 = 252
    AE2 + 49 = 625

             AE2 = 576
              AE = 24.

                                                                     Figure . Draw OA, OB, OC and OD.
Since perpendicular OE bisects AB (Theorem 1)
BE = AE = 24 and so AB = AE + BE = 24 + 24 = 48.
Similarly, to nd CF, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle COF:

      CF2 + OF2 = OC2
       CF2 + 152 = 252
      CF2 + 225 = 625

              CF2 = 400
                CF = 20
Again, from Theorem 1, we know OF bisects CD, hence DF = CF = 20 and CD = 40.
ANSWER : AB = 48, CD = 40, AB is larger than CD.

                                                                                                                     254

Example E suggests the following Theorem (which we state without proof):
     THEOREM 4

 The length of a chord is determined by its distance from the center of the circle; the
 closer to the center, the larger the chord.

   7.3 TANGENTS TO THE CIRCLE
A tangent to a circle is a line which intersects the circle in exactly one point. In Figure 1
line AB is a tangent, intersecting circle O just at point P.

                                 Figure . AB is tangent to circle O at point P.
  A tangent has the following important property:

      THEOREM 1
  A tangent is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of intersection.

In Figure 1 tangent AB is perpendicular to radius OP at the point of intersection P.

According to Theorem 1, QPO
theorem to right triangle QPO :

   62 + 82 = x2
  36 + 64 = x2

       100 = x2

Proof of Theorem :
OP is the shortest line segment that can be drawn from O to line AB. This is because if Q
were another point on AB then OQ would be longer than radius OR = OP (Figure 2).
Therefore OPAB since the shortest line segment that can be drawn from a point to a
straight line is the perpendicular (Theorem 2, Section .). This completes the proof.

            Figure . OP is the shortest line segment that can be drawn from O to line AB.

The converse of Theorem 1 is also true:

     THEOREM 2

 A line perpendicular to a radius at a point touching the circle must be a tangent.
 In Figure 3, if OPAB then AB must be a tangent; that is, P is the only point at which
 AB can touch the circle (see Figure 4).

Figure . If OPAB then AB must be a  Figure . Theorem 2 implies that this
           tangent.                            cannot happen.

Proof of Theorem :
Suppose Q were some other point on AB. Then OQ is the hypotenuse of right triangle
OPQ (see Figure 3). According to Theorem 1, section ., the hypotenuse of a right triangle
is always larger than a leg. Therefore hypotenuse OQ is larger than leg OP. Since OQ is
larger than the radius OP, Q cannot be on the circle. We have shown that no other point on
AB besides P can be on the circle. Therefore AB is a tangent. This completes the proof.

                                                                          258

SOLUTION

AP and BP are tangent to circle O, so by Theorem 1, OAP = OBP = 90°. The sum of the
angles of quadrilateral AOBP is 360° (see Example E, Section .), hence

90 + ( 3 x + 10) + 90 + 4 x = 360
     2               3

        3 x + 4 x + 190 = 360
        23

           3 x + 4 x = 170
           23

        (6)( 3 x) + (6)( 4 x) = (6)(170)
        2            3

           9x + 8x = 1020

                     17x = 1020

                        x = 60.

Substituting 60 for x, we nd

O = ( 3 x + 10)° = ( 3 (60) + 10)° = (90 + 10)° = 100° and
     2            2

 In Figure 5 if AP and BP are tangents then AP = BP.

                        Figure . If AP and BP are tangents then AP = BP.

Proof of Theorem :
Draw OA, OB and OP (Figure 6). OA = OB (all radii are equal), OP = OP (identity) and
A = B = 90° (Theorem 1), hence AOP  BOP by Hyp-Leg = Hyp-Leg. Therefore
AP = BP beause they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles.

SOLUTION

x° =° AB =° 360° - 310° = 50°, OA = OB since all radii are equal. Therefore AOB is

isosceles with y° = z°. We have
 x° + y° + z° = 180°

50° + y° + y° = 180°

Before giving the proof of Theorem 1 let us see if we can prove the answer to Example C.
Draw the diameter from B through center O (Figure 4). ABC is divided by the diameter
into two smaller angles, ABD and DBC, whose sum is 70°. Suppose ABD = 30° and
DBC = 40° (Figure 5). AO = BO because all radii are equal. Hence AOB is isosceles with
A = ABD = 30°. Similarly C = DBC = 40°. AOD is an exterior angle of AOB and so
is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles, 30° + 30° = 60° (Theorem 2, Section .).
Similarly COD = 40° + 40° = 80°. Therefore central angle AOC = 60° + 80° = 140° and

arc AC =° 140° . This agrees with our answer to Example C.

  We will now give a formal proof of Theorem 1, which will hold for any inscribed angle:

Proof of Theorem :
There are three cases according to whether the center is on, inside or outside the inscribed
angle (Figures 6, 7 and 8).

Case I.
The center is on the inscribed angIe (Figure 6). Draw AO. The radii are equal so AO = BO

and A = B = x°. Therefore AC =° AOC = x° + x° = 2x° and ABC = x° =° 1 AC.

                                                                                                 2

Case II.
The center is inside the inscribed angle (Figure 7). Draw diameter BD from B through O.

From case I we know ABD = x° =° 12 AD and DBC = y° =° 12 DC. Hence

From case I we know ABD = x° =° 1 AD and CBD = y° =° 1 CD. Therefore
                        2                                    2

          HISTORICAL NOTE

The practice of dividing the circle into 360 degrees goes back to the Greeks of the
second century B.C., who in turn may have taken it over from the Babylonians. The
reason for using the number 360 is not clear. It could stem from an early
astronomical assumption that a year consisted of 360 days. Another explanation
relies on the fact that the Babylonians used a sexagesimal or base 60 number system
instead of the decimal or base 10 system that we use today. It is assumed that the
Babylonians may have also used 60 as a convenient value for the radius of a circle.
Since the circumference of a circle is about 6 times the radius (see next section),
such a circle would consist of 360 units.

   7.5 CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE

The circumference of a circle is the perimeter of the circle, the length of the line obtained
by cutting the circle and "straightening out the curves" (Figure 1).

                                      A
                                                            BA B

Figure . The circumference of a circle is the length of the line obtained by cutting the circle and
            straightening out the curves.

   It is impractical to measure the circumference of most circular objects directly. A circular
tape measure would be hard to hold in place and would become distorted as it would be
bent. The object itself would be destroyed if we tried to cut it and straighten it out for
measurement. Fortunately we can calculate the circumference of a circle from its radius or
diameter, which are easy to measure.

   An approximate value for the circumference of a circle of radius x can be obtained by
calculating the perimeter of a regular hexagon of radius r inscribed in the circle (Figure 2).
We see that the circumference is a little more than the perimeter of the hexagon, which is 6
times the radius or 3 times the diameter. To get a better approximation, we increase the
number of sides of the inscribed regular polygon.

                                                        60°

Figure . Regular hexagon ABCDEF is inscribed in circle O. Both have radius r and center O.
   As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases, the polygon looks more and more

like a circle (Figure 3). In Section ., we calculated the perimeter of a 90-sided regular
polygon to be 3.141 times the diameter or 6.282 times the radius.

283
                                           Regular Polygons and Circles

    The perimeter of a 1000-sided regular polygon turned out to be only slightly larger,
3.1416 times the diameter or 6.283 times the radius. It therefore seems reasonable to
conclude that the circumference of a circle is about 3.14 times its diameter or 6.28 times its
radius.

                     Figure . A regular polygon of 15 sides looks almost like a circle.

      THEOREM 1
  The circumference of a circle is  times its diameter or 2 times its radius, where  is
  approximately 3.14.

                                         C = d or C = 2r

  The symbol  (Greek letter pi) is standard notation for the number by which the diameter
of a circle must be multiplied to get the circumference. Its value is usually taken to be 3.14,
though 3.1416 and 22/7 are other commonly used approximations. These numbers are not
exact, for like 2, it can be shown that  is an irrational number (innite nonrepeating
decimal). Its value to 50 decimal places is

SOLUTION
C = d = (3.14)(4) = 12.56.
ANSWER : 12.56.
We dene the length of an arc in the same manner as we dened circumference. We
calculate it by multiplying the circumference by the appropriate fraction.

      EXAMPLE B

 Find the length of arc AB:

                                                             90°

SOLUTION

C = 2r = 3(3.14)(10) = 62.8.

Since 90° is 1 of 360°, AB is 1 of the circumference C. AB = 1 C = 1 (62.8) = 15.7.
           4                  4                          44

ANSWER : 15.7.

As we stated in Section ., the plain = symbol will be used for arc length and the =° symbol

will be used for degrees. Thus in Example B, AB = 15.7 but AB =° 90°.

We may also use the following formula to nd arc length:

                      Arc length = Degrees in Arc . Circumference
                                            360°

           or simply

                                 L= D .C .
                                     360°

Thus in Example B,

L = D . C = 90 . (62.8) = 1 (62.8) = 15.7.

ANSWER : 2.09.

   EXAMPLE D
Find the diameter of a circle whose circumference is 628.

SOLUTION
Letting C = 628 and  = 3.14 in the formula for circumference, we have

    C = d
 628 = (3.14)d

628 = 3.14d                                                           ANSWER : diameter = 200.
3.14 3.14
 200 = d

Application:
The odometer and speedometer of an automobile are calibrated in accordance with the
number of rotations of one of the wheels. Suppose the diameter of a tire mounted on the
wheel is 2 feet. Then its circumference is C = d = (3.14)(2) = 6.28 feet. Since 1 mile =
5280 feet, the wheel will rotate 5280 ÷ 6.28 = 841 times every mile. If the size of the tires
is changed for any reason the odometer and speedometer must be recalibrated.

                                                                       286

               HISTORICAL NOTE

     The circumference of the earth was rst accurately calculated by the Greek
     geographer Eratosthenes (c. 284 - 192 B.C.), who lived in Alexandria, Egypt. It was
     known that at noon on the day of the summer solstice the sun's rays completely lit
     up the wells of Syene (now called Aswan), Egypt. This indicated that the rays of the
     sun were perpendicular to the Earth's surface at Syene, and so, in Figure 4, DS
     passes through the earth's center O. At the same time, in Alexandria, Eratosthenes
     observed that the sun's rays were making an angle of 1/50 of 360° (that is, 7.2°)
     with the perpendicular (BAC = 7.2° in Figure 4). The rays of the sun are assumed

     to be parallel hence AOS = BAC = 7.2° and AS =° 7.2°. Since the distance between
     Alexandria and Syene is about 500 miles (the length of AS). Eratosthenes was able

     to come up with a remarkably accurate gure of about (50)(500) = 25,000 miles for
     the circumference of the earth.

                                                                              7.2°
                                                                 7.2°

     Figure . The sun's rays were perpendicular to the Earth's surface at S at the same time they
               were making an angle of 7.2° with the perpendicular at A.

     Early crude estimates of the value of  were made by the Chinese ( = 3),

     Babylonians  (  =  3  or  3  1  ),  and  Egyptians  (  =  3.16).  The  value      =  3  is  also  the
                                  8
     one assumed in the Bible (I Kings 7:23). The rst accurate calculation was carried

     out by Archimedes (287 - 212 B.C.), the greatest mathematician of antiquity.

     (Archimedes was also a famous physicist and inventor. For example, he discovered

     the principle that a solid immersed in a liquid is buoyed up by a force equal to the

     weight of the uid displaced.) In his treatise On the Measurement of the Circle he

     approximates the circumference by calculating the perimeters of inscribed and

     circumscribed regular polygons (Figure 5). This is similar to the method we

     described in the text except that Archimedes did not have accurate trigonometric

     tables and had to derive his own formulas. By carrying the process as far as the case
     of the polygon of 96 sides he found the value of  to be between 310 and 3 1 .

 accurate calculations of the value of . Since the 17th century these calculations

   7.6 AREA OF A CIRCLE
In chapter 6 we dened the area of a closed gure to be the number of square units
contained in the gure. To apply this denition to the circle, we will again assume a circle is
a regular polygon with a large number of sides. The following formula is then obtained:

      THEOREM 1
  The area of circle is  times the square of its radius.

                                                    A = r2

      EXAMPLE A
   Find the area of the circle:

SOLUTION
A = r2 = (3)2 = 9 = 9(3.14) = 28.26.
ANSWER : 28.26.
Proof of Theorem :
The area of a circle with radius r is approximately equal to the area of a regular polygon
with apothem a = r circumscribed about the circle (Figure 1). The approximation becomes
more exact as the number of sides of the polygon becomes larger. At the same time the
perimeter of the polygon approximates the circumference of the circle (= 2r).

        Figure . Regular polygon with apothem a = r circumscribed about circle with radius r.
                                                                                                                     292
                                           Regular Polygons and Circles

Using the formula for the area of a regular polygon (Theorem 4, Section .) we have
area of circle = area of polygon = 12 aP = 12 r(2r) = r.

      EXAMPLE B
   Find the shaded area:

                60°

SOLUTION                                                                         60°
The shaded area OAB is 60 = 1 of the total                                   60° 60°
area (see Figure 2). 360 6                                                   60° 60° 60°
The area of the whole circle = r2 = (3)2 = 9 = 9(3.14) = 28.26.
Therefore the area of OAB = 16 (28.26) = 4.71.                             Figure .
                                                                        A circle divided

The shaded area in Example B is called a sector of the circle. Example B suggests the
following formula for the area of a sector:

     Area of sector = Degrees in arc of sector . Area of circle
                                     360

     or simply

                A = D . r2 .
                     360

Using this formula, the solution of Example B would be
A = D 360 r2 = 60 360 (3.14)(3)2 = 16 (3.14)(9) = 16 (28.26) = 4.71.

   EXAMPLE C
Find the shaded area:

                                   60°

SOLUTION

Let us rst nd the area of triangle OAB (Figure 3).              30° 30°

OAB is equilateral with base b = AB = 10.
Drawing in height h = OC we have that AOC is a
30° - 60° - 90° triangle with AC = 5 and h = 53.
Therefore

shaded area = area of sector OAB - area of triangle OAB    60°           60°

          = 60 (10)2 - 1 (10)(53)                          Triangle OAB with
          360             2                                base b and height h.

          = 1 (100) - 1 (503)
          6               2

          = 50 - 253                                     ANSWER : 50 - 253 or 9.03.
                3                                                     3

          = 50(3.14) - 25(1.732)
                  3

          = 52.33 - 43.30 = 9.03.

   The shaded area in Example C is called a segment of the circle. The area of a segment is
obtained by subtracting the area of the triangle from the area of the sector.

                                                                                 294

   EXAMPLE D
Find the shaded area:

SOLUTION

The area of the large semicircle = 12 r2 = 12 (20)2 = 12 (400) = 200.
The area of each of the smaller semicircles = 12 r2 = 12 (10)2 = 12 (100) = 50.
Therefore

shaded area = area of large semicircle - (2)(area of small semicircles)

          = 200 - 2(50)

          = 200 - 100

          = 100 = 100(3.14) = 314.                          ANSWER : 100 or 314.

          HISTORICAL NOTE

     Problem 50 of the Rhind Papyrus, a mathematical treatise written by an Egyptian

     scribe in about 1650 B.C., states that the area of a circular eld with a diameter of 9

     units is the same as the area of a square with a side of 8 units. This is equivalent to
     using the formula A = ( 8 d)2 to nd the area of a circle. If we let d = 2r this

                                   9
     becomes A = ( 89 d)2 = ( 89 .2r)2 = (169 r)2 = 256 81 r2 or about 3.16r2 . Comparing this
     with our modern formula A = r2 we nd that the ancient Egyptains had a
     remarkably good approximation, 3.16, for the value of .

     In the same work in which he calculated the value of , Archimedes gives a

     formula for the area of a circle (see Historical Note, Section .). He states that the

     area of a circle is equal to the area of a right triangle whose base b is as long as the

     circumference and whose altitude h equals the radius. Letting b = C and h = r in the

     formula for the area of a triangle, we obtain A = 1 bh = 1 Cr = 1 (2r) = r2, the
                                    2                    2  2

  APPENDIX

                                         PROOF OF THE Z THEOREM :
  In section 1.4 we stated but did not prove the following theorem:

      THEOREM 1 (THE "Z" THEOREM)
  If two lines are parallel then their alternate interior angles are equal. If the alternate
  interior angles of two lines are equal then the lines must be parallel.
Theorem 1 consists of two statements, each one the converse of the other. We will prove
the second statement rst:

      THEOREM 1 (SECOND PART)
  If the alternate interior angles of two lines are equal then the lines must be parallel. In
  Figure 1, if x = x then AB must be parallel to CD.

                    Figure . We will prove that if x = x then AB is parallel to CD.
Proof :
Suppose x = x and AB is not parallel to CD. This means that AB and CD meet at some
point G, as in Figure 2, forming a triangle, KLG.

                Figure . If AB is not parallel to CD then they must meet at some point G.
299
   We know from the discussion preceding the ASA Theorem (Theorem 1, Section .) that
KLG can be constructed from the two angles x and y and the included side KL. Now
x = x (by assumption) and y= y (y = 180° - x = 180° - x = y). Therefore by
the same construction x and y when extended should yield a triangle congruent to
KLG . Call this new triangle LKH (see Figure 3). We now have that AB and CD are both
straight lines through G and H. This is impossible since one and only one distinct straight
line can be drawn through two points. Therefore our assumption that AB is not parallel to
CD is incorrect, that is, AB must be parallel to CD. This completes the proof.

Figure . Since x = x and y = y, x and y when extended should also form a triangle,
          LKH.

      THEOREM 1 (FIRST PART)
  If two lines are parallel then their alternate interior angles are equal. In Figure 4, if AB is
  parallel to CD then x = x.

                    Figure . We will prove that if AB is parallel to CD then x = x.
Proof :
Suppose AB is parallel to CD and x  x. One of the angles is larger; suppose it is x
that is larger. Draw EF through P so that w = x as in Figure 5. EF is parallel to CD
because we have just proven (Theorem 1, second part) that two lines are parallel if their
alternate interior angles are equal.

                                                                                                                     300
   This contradicts the parallel postulate (Section .) which states that through a point not
on a given line (here point P and line CD) one and only one line can be drawn parallel to
the given line. Therefore x must be equal to x . This completes the proof of Theorem 1.

                                      Figure . Draw EF so that w = x.
