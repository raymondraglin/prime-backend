          Intersections of Identity and Mathematics

Individual Project, 24 points       Due ________________________

Purpose:

    · For you to reflect on your many identities and math experience to set personal goals
    · To build a database of diverse mathematicians for instructors to use in their classes

Part 1. Personal Reflection Paper: 1-2 pages typed (double spaced) in paragraph form and printed.

         a. Your Math Story/History - What has your experience been with math so far? Are there
         significant events that have shaped your math experience?

         b. Current Math Identity - How do you feel about math? How do you see yourself in relation
         to math and quantitative reasoning? You can talk about math in school as well as in daily life.

         c. Three Elements of Identity - The wheel below shows some of the elements that make up
         an individual's social or personal identity. You are welcome to add elements. Which three
         elements have had the greatest impact on your math identity and/or math education? Have
         you been impacted by stereotypes or stereotype threat?

         d. Goal(s) - What goal(s) do you have for yourself in math and quantitative reasoning?

                                                                          Elements of Social Identity

Other elements:

    · Fixed mindset or
         growth mindset

    · Parents level of
         education

    · Parents math
         identity

Part 2. One Google Slide and Presentation (3 minutes): Create your slide in the shared class slideshow.

a. Find and research a math hero, icon, avatar, idol, representative (current or past) with whom
you identify with in some way.

b. Create one Google Slide with an image and a brief history or description. Cite all sources on
the slide (with a clickable link if possible).

c. Share your slide and mathematician on the presentation day in person or make a video in
advance. Share something from your reflection that you feel comfortable sharing. This will help
us all get to know you.

Examples for Math Heroes/Icons/Representatives

Benjamin Banneker    Ada Lovelace               Alan Turing

Nina Karlovna Bari   Stephen Hawking            Grace Hopper

          José Ádem  Sun-Yung Alice Chang       Srinivasa Ramanujan
