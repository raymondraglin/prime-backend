About College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support

College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support integrates comprehensive algebraic principles with effective foundational
review. Each College Algebra 2e textbook section is paired with a thoughtfully developed, topically aligned skills module
that prepares students for the course material. The modules include conceptual overviews, worked examples, and
guided practice; they incorporate relevant material from OpenStax's Developmental Math series. The modular approach
and richness of content ensure that the book meets the needs of a variety of courses. College Algebra 2e with
Corequisite Support offers a wealth of examples with detailed, conceptual explanations, building a strong foundation in
the material before asking students to apply what they've learned.

Development Overview

College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, and
instructors experience and expertise led to a highly flexible and supportive resource for student at a range of levels.
Special thanks is due the original College Algebra author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University. Based on the widely
used core text, Corequisite leader Sharon North (St. Louis Community College) developed a coordinated set of support
resources, which provide review, instruction, and practice for algebra students.

The author team identified foundational skills and concepts, then mapped them to each module. These became the
Corequisite Skills modules that precede each section of the text. In addition, Professor North authored a set of Labs
designed for use in classes or workshops.
2 Preface

    The collective experience of our author team allowed us to pinpoint the subtopics, exceptions, and individual
    connections that give students the most trouble. The textbook is therefore replete with well-designed features and
    highlights, which help students overcome these barriers. As the students read and practice, they are coached in methods
    of thinking through problems and internalizing mathematical processes.

   Changes to the Second Edition

    The College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy as well as
    inclusivity. Examples, Exercises, and Solutions were reviewed by multiple faculty experts. All improvement suggestions
    and errata updates, driven by faculty and students from several thousand colleges, were considered and unified across
    the different formats of the text.

    OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when textbooks
    are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized any
    shifting of exercise numbers.

    The revision also focused on supporting inclusive and welcoming learning experiences. The introductory narratives,
    example and problem contexts, and even many of the names used for fictional people in the text were all reviewed using
    a diversity, equity, and inclusion framework. Several hundred resulting revisions improve the balance and relevance to
    the students using the text, while maintaining a variety of applications to diverse careers and academic fields. In
    particular, explanations of scientific and historical aspects of mathematics have been expanded to include more
    contributors. For example, the authors added additional historical and multicultural context regarding what is widely
    known as Pascal's Triangle, and similarly added details regarding the international process of decoding the Enigma
    machine (including the role of Polish college students). Several-chapter opening narratives and in-chapter references are
    completely new, and contexts across all chapters were specifically reviewed for equity in gender representation and
    connotation.

    Finally, prior to the release of this edition, OpenStax published a version to support Corequisite instruction, which is
    described in more detail below.

   Pedagogical Foundations and Features

   Corequisite Skills Modules

    Each College Algebra 2e section begins with a carefully developed skills component, designed to guide students though
    the prequisite material and provide the strongest possible foundation for their work. While the modules draw from some
    elements of OpenStax Intermediate Algebra, each one was adapted and enhance with new material to be most effective
    for students.

    The skills modules consist of the following:

       · Learning Objectives identifying the key concepts to be learned before students move on
       · Conceptual explanations and connections to subsequent material
       · Detailed worked examples
       · Practice problems

    The Corequisite skills modules are also available for download and printing on the College Algebra 2e with Corequisite
    Support book page.

   Examples

    Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving
    approaches that students must master. The multiple Examples model different approaches to the same type of problem
    or introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.

    All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. The question clearly lays out a mathematical problem to solve.
    The Solution walks through the steps, usually providing context for the approach -- in other words, why the instructor is
    solving the problem in a specific manner. Finally, the Analysis (for select examples) reflects on the broader implications
    of the Solution just shown. Examples are followed by a "Try It" question, as explained below.

   Figures

    College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support contains many figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are
    graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most
    important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to
    distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

Supporting Features

Several elements, each marked by a distinctive icon, contribute to and check understanding.
  · A How To is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that
      proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.
  · A Try It exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an
      immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem. In the PDF and the Web View version of the core College Algebra
      portions of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key. Answers to the Try It Exercises for
      the Corequisite Skills subsections are provided to instructors only so that they can decide on the best way to use
      them.
  · A Q&A may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts
      misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.
  · The Media icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of
      links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.

While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor
were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support.

Section Exercises

Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used
selectively for guided practice. With over 4600 exercises across the 9 chapters, instructors should have plenty from which
to choose.
Section Exercises are organized by question type, and generally appear in the following order:

  · Verbal questions assess conceptual understanding of key terms and concepts.
  · Algebraic problems require students to apply algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the section.
  · Graphical problems assess students' ability to interpret or produce a graph.
  · Numeric problems require the student to perform calculations or computations.
  · Technology problems encourage exploration through use of a graphing utility, either to visualize or verify algebraic

      results or to solve problems via an alternative to the methods demonstrated in the section.
  · Extensions pose problems more challenging than the Examples demonstrated in the section. They require students

      to synthesize multiple learning objectives or apply critical thinking to solve complex problems.
  · Real-World Applications present realistic problem scenarios from fields such as physics, geology, biology, finance,

      and the social sciences.

Chapter Review Features

Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that
students can use to prepare for exams.

  · Key Terms provides a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter.
  · Key Equations presents a compilation of formulas, theorems, and standard-form equations.
  · Key Concepts summarizes the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant

      Example(s) in case students need to review.
  · Chapter Review Exercises include 40-80 practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each

      section.
  · Practice Test includes 25-50 problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter. Note

      that the practice test is not organized by section, and may be more heavily weighted toward cumulative objectives
      as opposed to the foundational objectives covered in the opening sections.
4 Preface

       · Answer Key includes the answers to all Try It exercises and every other exercise from the Section Exercises, Chapter
           Review Exercises, and Practice Test.

   Accuracy of the Content

    We understand that precision and accuracy are imperatives in mathematics, and undertook an accuracy program led by
    experienced faculty. Examples, art, problems, and solutions were reviewed by dedicated faculty, with a separate team
    evaluating the answer key and solutions.

    The text also benefits from years of usage by thousands of faculty and students. A core aspect of the second edition
    revision process included consolidating and ensuring consistency with regard to any errata and corrections that have
    been implemented during the series' extensive usage and incorporation into homework systems.

   Additional Resources

    Student and Instructor Resources
    We've compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an instructor
    solution manual, and PowerPoint slides. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which can be
    requested on your openstax.org log-in. Take advantage of these resources to supplement your OpenStax book.

    The authors and OpenStax have provided substantial resources regarding teaching and learning in Corequisite
    environments. Any material that may be directly used by students -- including downloadable versions of the skills
    modules and the Labs -- will be included on the Student Resources page.

    Community Hubs
    OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer Community
    Hubs on OER Commons--a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax
    books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download resources
    to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant course content.

      Introduction to Prerequisites

It's a cold day in Antarctica. In fact, it's always a cold day in Antarctica. Earth's southernmost continent, Antarctica
experiences the coldest, driest, and windiest conditions known. The coldest temperature ever recorded, over one
hundred degrees below zero on the Celsius scale, was recorded by remote satellite. It is no surprise then, that no native
human population can survive the harsh conditions. Only explorers and scientists brave the environment for any length
of time.

Measuring and recording the characteristics of weather conditions in Antarctica requires a use of different kinds of
numbers. For tens of thousands of years, humans have undertaken methods to tally, track, and record numerical
information. While we don't know much about their usage, the Lebombo Bone (dated to about 35,000 BCE) and the
Ishango Bone (dated to about 20,000 BCE) are among the earliest mathematical artifacts. Found in Africa, their clearly
deliberate groupings of notches may have been used to track time, moon cycles, or other information. Performing
calculations with them and using the results to make predictions requires an understanding of relationships among
numbers. In this chapter, we will review sets of numbers and properties of operations used to manipulate numbers. This
understanding will serve as prerequisite knowledge throughout our study of algebra and trigonometry.

     when common themes emerge.

It is often said that mathematics is the language of science. If this is true, then an essential part of the language of
mathematics is numbers. The earliest use of numbers occurred 100 centuries ago in the Middle East to count, or
enumerate items. Farmers, cattle herders, and traders used tokens, stones, or markers to signify a single quantity--a
sheaf of grain, a head of livestock, or a fixed length of cloth, for example. Doing so made commerce possible, leading to
improved communications and the spread of civilization.

Three to four thousand years ago, Egyptians introduced fractions. They first used them to show reciprocals. Later, they
used them to represent the amount when a quantity was divided into equal parts.

But what if there were no cattle to trade or an entire crop of grain was lost in a flood? How could someone indicate the
existence of nothing? From earliest times, people had thought of a "base state" while counting and used various
symbols to represent this null condition. However, it was not until about the fifth century CE in India that zero was added
to the number system and used as a numeral in calculations.

Clearly, there was also a need for numbers to represent loss or debt. In India, in the seventh century CE, negative
numbers were used as solutions to mathematical equations and commercial debts. The opposites of the counting
numbers expanded the number system even further.

Because of the evolution of the number system, we can now perform complex calculations using these and other
categories of real numbers. In this section, we will explore sets of numbers, calculations with different kinds of numbers,
and the use of numbers in expressions.

Classifying a Real Number

The numbers we use for counting, or enumerating items, are the natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. We describe

them in set notation as     where the ellipsis (...) indicates that the numbers continue to infinity. The natural

numbers are, of course, also called the counting numbers. Any time we enumerate the members of a team, count the

coins in a collection, or tally the trees in a grove, we are using the set of natural numbers. The set of whole numbers is

the set of natural numbers plus zero:

The set of integers adds the opposites of the natural numbers to the set of whole numbers:
                                          It is useful to note that the set of integers is made up of three distinct subsets: negative

integers, zero, and positive integers. In this sense, the positive integers are just the natural numbers. Another way to
think about it is that the natural numbers are a subset of the integers.

The set of rational numbers is written as                                     Notice from the definition that rational

numbers are fractions (or quotients) containing integers in both the numerator and the denominator, and the

denominator is never 0. We can also see that every natural number, whole number, and integer is a rational number

with a denominator of 1.

Because they are fractions, any rational number can also be expressed in decimal form. Any rational number can be
represented as either:

 a terminating decimal:                or  a repeating decimal:
We use a line drawn over the repeating block of numbers instead of writing the group multiple times.

EXAMPLE 2

Identifying Rational Numbers
Write each of the following rational numbers as either a terminating or repeating decimal.

                      
  Solution

Write each fraction as a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator.

                      a repeating decimal                (or 3.0), a terminating decimal

       TRY IT #2 Write each of the following rational numbers as either a terminating or repeating decimal.

                  

Irrational Numbers

At some point in the ancient past, someone discovered that not all numbers are rational numbers. A builder, for
instance, may have found that the diagonal of a square with unit sides was not 2 or even but was something else. Or
a garment maker might have observed that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a roll of cloth was a little bit
more than 3, but still not a rational number. Such numbers are said to be irrational because they cannot be written as
fractions. These numbers make up the set of irrational numbers. Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a fraction
of two integers. It is impossible to describe this set of numbers by a single rule except to say that a number is irrational if
it is not rational. So we write this as shown.

EXAMPLE 3

Differentiating Rational and Irrational Numbers
Determine whether each of the following numbers is rational or irrational. If it is rational, determine whether it is a
terminating or repeating decimal.

  Solution                                   

  This can be simplified as                  Therefore,  is rational.

  Because it is a fraction of integers,      is a rational number. Next, simplify and divide.

So, is rational and a repeating decimal.

  This cannot be simplified any further. Therefore,      is an irrational number.

  Because it is a fraction of integers, is a rational number. Simplify and divide.

               is not a terminating decimal. Also note that there is no repeating pattern because the group

of 3s increases each time. Therefore it is neither a terminating nor a repeating decimal and, hence, not a rational

number. It is an irrational number.

  TRY IT #3  Determine whether each of the following numbers is rational or irrational. If it is rational,
             determine whether it is a terminating or repeating decimal.

                                                                          

Real Numbers

Given any number n, we know that n is either rational or irrational. It cannot be both. The sets of rational and irrational
numbers together make up the set of real numbers. As we saw with integers, the real numbers can be divided into
three subsets: negative real numbers, zero, and positive real numbers. Each subset includes fractions, decimals, and
irrational numbers according to their algebraic sign (+ or -). Zero is considered neither positive nor negative.

The real numbers can be visualized on a horizontal number line with an arbitrary point chosen as 0, with negative
numbers to the left of 0 and positive numbers to the right of 0. A fixed unit distance is then used to mark off each integer
(or other basic value) on either side of 0. Any real number corresponds to a unique position on the number line.The
converse is also true: Each location on the number line corresponds to exactly one real number. This is known as a one-
to-one correspondence. We refer to this as the real number line as shown in Figure 1.

  is negative and irrational. It lies to the left of 0.

             is a repeating decimal so it is rational and positive. It lies to the right of 0.

  TRY IT #4  Classify each number as either positive or negative and as either rational or irrational. Does the
             number lie to the left or the right of 0 on the number line?

                                                                          

Sets of Numbers as Subsets

Beginning with the natural numbers, we have expanded each set to form a larger set, meaning that there is a subset
relationship between the sets of numbers we have encountered so far. These relationships become more obvious when
seen as a diagram, such as Figure 2.

When we multiply a number by itself, we square it or raise it to a power of 2. For example,
any number to any power. In general, the exponential notation means that the number or variable

In this notation, is read as the nth power of or to the where is called the base and is called the exponent. A

term in exponential notation may be part of a mathematical expression, which is a combination of numbers and

operations. For example,  is a mathematical expression.

To evaluate a mathematical expression, we perform the various operations. However, we do not perform them in any
random order. We use the order of operations. This is a sequence of rules for evaluating such expressions.

Recall that in mathematics we use parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], and braces { } to group numbers and expressions so that
anything appearing within the symbols is treated as a unit. Additionally, fraction bars, radicals, and absolute value bars
are treated as grouping symbols. When evaluating a mathematical expression, begin by simplifying expressions within
grouping symbols.

The next step is to address any exponents or radicals. Afterward, perform multiplication and division from left to right
and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

Let's take a look at the expression provided.

There are no grouping symbols, so we move on to exponents or radicals. The number 4 is raised to a power of 2, so
simplify as 16.

Next, perform multiplication or division, left to right.
Lastly, perform addition or subtraction, left to right.

Therefore,
For some complicated expressions, several passes through the order of operations will be needed. For instance, there
may be a radical expression inside parentheses that must be simplified before the parentheses are evaluated. Following
the order of operations ensures that anyone simplifying the same mathematical expression will get the same result.

  Order of Operations

  Operations in mathematical expressions must be evaluated in a systematic order, which can be simplified using the

       HOW TO

Given a mathematical expression, simplify it using the order of operations.

Step 1.  Simplify any expressions within grouping symbols.
Step 2.  Simplify any expressions containing exponents or radicals.
Step 3.  Perform any multiplication and division in order, from left to right.
Step 4.  Perform any addition and subtraction in order, from left to right.

     Solution





Note that in the first step, the radical is treated as a grouping symbol, like parentheses. Also, in the third step, the
fraction bar is considered a grouping symbol so the numerator is considered to be grouped.

Using Properties of Real Numbers

For some activities we perform, the order of certain operations does not matter, but the order of other operations does.
For example, it does not make a difference if we put on the right shoe before the left or vice-versa. However, it does
matter whether we put on shoes or socks first. The same thing is true for operations in mathematics.

Commutative Properties
The commutative property of addition states that numbers may be added in any order without affecting the sum.

We can better see this relationship when using real numbers.

Similarly, the commutative property of multiplication states that numbers may be multiplied in any order without
affecting the product.

Again, consider an example with real numbers.

It is important to note that neither subtraction nor division is commutative. For example,  is not the same as
          Similarly,

Associative Properties
The associative property of multiplication tells us that it does not matter how we group numbers when multiplying.
We can move the grouping symbols to make the calculation easier, and the product remains the same.

Consider this example.

The associative property of addition tells us that numbers may be grouped differently without affecting the sum.

This property can be especially helpful when dealing with negative integers. Consider this example.
18 1 · Prerequisites

     Are subtraction and division associative? Review these examples.

As we can see, neither subtraction nor division is associative.
Distributive Property
The distributive property states that the product of a factor times a sum is the sum of the factor times each term in the
sum.

This property combines both addition and multiplication (and is the only property to do so). Let us consider an example.

Note that 4 is outside the grouping symbols, so we distribute the 4 by multiplying it by 12, multiplying it by -7, and
adding the products.
To be more precise when describing this property, we say that multiplication distributes over addition. The reverse is not
true, as we can see in this example.

A special case of the distributive property occurs when a sum of terms is subtracted.

For example, consider the difference       We can rewrite the difference of the two terms 12 and  by

turning the subtraction expression into addition of the opposite. So instead of subtracting  we add the opposite.

Now, distribute and simplify the result.

This seems like a lot of trouble for a simple sum, but it illustrates a powerful result that will be useful once we introduce
algebraic terms. To subtract a sum of terms, change the sign of each term and add the results. With this in mind, we can
rewrite the last example.

Identity Properties
The identity property of addition states that there is a unique number, called the additive identity (0) that, when added
to a number, results in the original number.

The identity property of multiplication states that there is a unique number, called the multiplicative identity (1) that,
when multiplied by a number, results in the original number.

For example, we have                  and  There are no exceptions for these properties; they work for every

real number, including 0 and 1.

Inverse Properties
The inverse property of addition states that, for every real number a, there is a unique number, called the additive
inverse (or opposite), denoted by (-a), that, when added to the original number, results in the additive identity, 0.

For example, if    the additive inverse is 8, since

The inverse property of multiplication holds for all real numbers except 0 because the reciprocal of 0 is not defined.
The property states that, for every real number a, there is a unique number, called the multiplicative inverse (or
reciprocal), denoted that, when multiplied by the original number, results in the multiplicative identity, 1.

Evaluating Algebraic Expressions

So far, the mathematical expressions we have seen have involved real numbers only. In mathematics, we may see

expressions such as              or  In the expression  5 is called a constant because it does not vary

and x is called a variable because it does. (In naming the variable, ignore any exponents or radicals containing the
variable.) An algebraic expression is a collection of constants and variables joined together by the algebraic operations
of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

We have already seen some real number examples of exponential notation, a shorthand method of writing products of
the same factor. When variables are used, the constants and variables are treated the same way.

In each case, the exponent tells us how many factors of the base to use, whether the base consists of constants or
variables.

Any variable in an algebraic expression may take on or be assigned different values. When that happens, the value of the
algebraic expression changes. To evaluate an algebraic expression means to determine the value of the expression for a
given value of each variable in the expression. Replace each variable in the expression with the given value, then simplify
the resulting expression using the order of operations. If the algebraic expression contains more than one variable,
replace each variable with its assigned value and simplify the expression as before.

Formulas

An equation is a mathematical statement indicating that two expressions are equal. The expressions can be numerical
or algebraic. The equation is not inherently true or false, but only a proposition. The values that make the equation true,
the solutions, are found using the properties of real numbers and other results. For example, the equation
has the solution of 3 because when we substitute 3 for in the equation, we obtain the true statement

A formula is an equation expressing a relationship between constant and variable quantities. Very often, the equation is
a means of finding the value of one quantity (often a single variable) in terms of another or other quantities. One of the
most common examples is the formula for finding the area of a circle in terms of the radius of the circle:
For any value of the area can be found by evaluating the expression

Consider spending at least 2 hours of your study time each week at your campus (or virtual) math tutoring center or
with a study group, the time will be well spent!

2. Another way to optimize your class and study time is to have a plan for efficiency, meaning make every minute
     count. Below is a list of good practices, check off those you feel you could utilize this term.

1. Attend each class session.
It will take much more time to teach yourself the content.

2. Ask your instructor.
If you are unsure of a concept being taught in class, ask for clarification right away. Your
instructor is an expert in their field and can provide the most efficient path to understanding.

3. Be prepared for each class.
Having completed prior assignments can go a long way in math understanding since
mastery of most learning objectives depends on knowledge of prior concepts.
Also, reading through a section prior to class will help to make concepts much clearer.

4. Stay organized.
Keeping your math materials in a 3-ring binder organized by lecture notes, class handouts,
PowerPoint slides, and homework problems will save you time in finding materials when you
need them. Having two spiral notebooks dedicated to math works well too, use one for class
notes and one for homework assignments.

5. Find a study partner.
Making a connection either in class or virtually with a fellow student can save time in that
now there are two sources for gathering important information. If you have to miss class or
an online session for an important appointment, your study partner can provide you class
notes, share in-class handouts, or relay announcements for your instructor.
Study partner's name:
Study partner's number:
Study partner's email address:

6. Begin exam review time by reworking each of the examples your instructor worked
in class.
Your instructor will emphasize the same topics in both lecture and on exams based on
student learning objectives required by your college or university or even the state where
the course is offered. Follow their lead in assigning importance to an objective and master
these topics first.

 3. Creating your Semester Calendar- complete the following weekly schedule being sure to label
        time in classes
        study time for classes
        time at work.
      Optional: also include if you want a more comprehensive view of your time commitments
        time spent exercising
        time with family and friends.

Mathematicians, scientists, and economists commonly encounter very large and very small numbers. But it may not be
obvious how common such figures are in everyday life. For instance, a pixel is the smallest unit of light that can be
perceived and recorded by a digital camera. A particular camera might record an image that is 2,048 pixels by 1,536
pixels, which is a very high resolution picture. It can also perceive a color depth (gradations in colors) of up to 48 bits per
frame, and can shoot the equivalent of 24 frames per second. The maximum possible number of bits of information
used to film a one-hour (3,600-second) digital film is then an extremely large number.

Using a calculator, we enter                            and press ENTER. The calculator displays 1.304596316E13.

What does this mean? The "E13" portion of the result represents the exponent 13 of ten, so there are a maximum of

approximately         bits of data in that one-hour film. In this section, we review rules of exponents first and then

apply them to calculations involving very large or small numbers.

Using the Product Rule of Exponents

Consider the product             Both terms have the same base, x, but they are raised to different exponents. Expand each

expression, and then rewrite the resulting expression.

The result is that

Notice that the exponent of the product is the sum of the exponents of the terms. In other words, when multiplying
exponential expressions with the same base, we write the result with the common base and add the exponents. This is
the product rule of exponents.

Now consider an example with real numbers.

We can always check that this is true by simplifying each exponential expression. We find that is 8, is 16, and is

128. The product      equals 128, so the relationship is true. We can use the product rule of exponents to simplify

expressions that are a product of two numbers or expressions with the same base but different exponents.

The Product Rule of Exponents

EXAMPLE 1

Using the Product Rule
Write each of the following products with a single base. Do not simplify further.

  Solution                      

Use the product rule to simplify each expression.

                                                                                   
At first, it may appear that we cannot simplify a product of three factors. However, using the associative property of

multiplication, begin by simplifying the first two.

Notice we get the same result by adding the three exponents in one step.

  TRY IT #1 Write each of the following products with a single base. Do not simplify further.

                                                       

Using the Quotient Rule of Exponents

The quotient rule of exponents allows us to simplify an expression that divides two numbers with the same base but
different exponents. In a similar way to the product rule, we can simplify an expression such as where

Consider the example Perform the division by canceling common factors.

Notice that the exponent of the quotient is the difference between the exponents of the divisor and dividend.

In other words, when dividing exponential expressions with the same base, we write the result with the common base
and subtract the exponents.

For the time being, we must be aware of the condition    Otherwise, the difference   could be zero or negative.

Those possibilities will be explored shortly. Also, instead of qualifying variables as nonzero each time, we will simplify

matters and assume from here on that all variables represent nonzero real numbers.

Using the Quotient Rule

  Solution

Use the quotient rule to simplify each expression.

Using the Power Rule of Exponents

Suppose an exponential expression is raised to some power. Can we simplify the result? Yes. To do this, we use the

power rule of exponents. Consider the expression    The expression inside the parentheses is multiplied twice

because it has an exponent of 2. Then the result is multiplied three times because the entire expression has an exponent

of 3.

The exponent of the answer is the product of the exponents:                        In other words, when raising an

exponential expression to a power, we write the result with the common base and the product of the exponents.

Be careful to distinguish between uses of the product rule and the power rule. When using the product rule, different
terms with the same bases are raised to exponents. In this case, you add the exponents. When using the power rule, a
term in exponential notation is raised to a power. In this case, you multiply the exponents.

Using the Zero Exponent Rule of Exponents

Return to the quotient rule. We made the condition that  so that the difference        would never be zero or

negative. What would happen if        In this case, we would use the zero exponent rule of exponents to simplify the

expression to 1. To see how this is done, let us begin with an example.

If we were to simplify the original expression using the quotient rule, we would have

If we equate the two answers, the result is      This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing
a real number.

value to be undefined.

A factor with a negative exponent becomes the same factor with a positive exponent if it is moved across the fraction
bar--from numerator to denominator or vice versa.

electron, which is about 0.00000000000047 m. How can we effectively work read, compare, and calculate with numbers
such as these?

A shorthand method of writing very small and very large numbers is called scientific notation, in which we express
numbers in terms of exponents of 10. To write a number in scientific notation, move the decimal point to the right of the
first digit in the number. Write the digits as a decimal number between 1 and 10. Count the number of places n that you
moved the decimal point. Multiply the decimal number by 10 raised to a power of n. If you moved the decimal left as in a
very large number, is positive. If you moved the decimal right as in a small large number, is negative.

For example, consider the number 2,780,418. Move the decimal left until it is to the right of the first nonzero digit, which
is 2.

We obtain 2.780418 by moving the decimal point 6 places to the left. Therefore, the exponent of 10 is 6, and it is positive
because we moved the decimal point to the left. This is what we should expect for a large number.

Working with small numbers is similar. Take, for example, the radius of an electron, 0.00000000000047 m. Perform the
same series of steps as above, except move the decimal point to the right.

Be careful not to include the leading 0 in your count. We move the decimal point 13 places to the right, so the exponent
of 10 is 13. The exponent is negative because we moved the decimal point to the right. This is what we should expect for
a small number.

Using Scientific Notation in Applications

Scientific notation, used with the rules of exponents, makes calculating with large or small numbers much easier than

doing so using standard notation. For example, suppose we are asked to calculate the number of atoms in 1 L of water.

Each water molecule contains 3 atoms (2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen). The average drop of water contains around

  molecules of water and 1 L of water holds about                    average drops. Therefore, there are

approximately                                      atoms in 1 L of water. We simply multiply the decimal

terms and add the exponents. Imagine having to perform the calculation without using scientific notation!

When performing calculations with scientific notation, be sure to write the answer in proper scientific notation. For

example, consider the product                                        The answer is not in proper scientific notation

because 35 is greater than 10. Consider 35 as  That adds a ten to the exponent of the answer.

           Use the quotient rule to simplify square roots.
           Add and subtract square roots.

  COREQUISITE SKILLS

Learning Objective:

           Investigate the discipline called learning science and the idea of a knowledge space.

Objective 1: Investigate the discipline called learning science and the idea of a knowledge space.

The brain is a complex organ. It is the control center for our bodies, while the mind is where thinking and learning take
place. In an attempt to understand the processes that occur in learning, researchers study a collection of disciplines
called learning sciences. This interdisciplinary field includes study of psychological, sociological, anthropological, and
computational approaches to learning.

In this skill sheet we will investigate the mathematics of mastery and knowledge spaces. A knowledge space includes
the possible states of knowledge of a human learner. The theory of knowledge space was introduced in 1985 by
mathematical psychologists Jean-Paul Doignon and Jean-Claude Falmagne and has since been studied by many
researchers. 1

Practice Makes Perfect
Investigation: There are 32 student-learning outcomes (SLO's) in a typical College Algebra course. These are topics a
student needs to master to show proficiency in College Algebra. Let's begin by looking at just a few of these skills. Let's
assign the variables, A, B, C, and D to the following topics. We will name the set containing each of these 4 topics, Q.

  · A = Graph the basic functions listed in the library of functions.
  · B = Find the domain of a function defined by an equation.
  · C = Create a new function through composition of functions.
  · D = Find linear functions that model data sets.

Using roster notation Q = {A, B, C, D}.

1. List each of the possible subsets of the 4 topics listed above using roster notation. Remember a subset is a
    collection of topics in which each topic listed is an element of the set Q we defined above. By including a topic, we
    are indicating that the student has mastered the topic.

2. Verify in your work above you have listed all 16 subsets to set Q. Remember that a subset may contain all of the
    topics listed in Q.

          could be mastered or not by a student. Show below that your formula would be equal to 16 for a list of 4 topics.

     4. Now use the formula you found in #3 to find the number of subsets possible if we include all 32 student-learning
          outcomes.
          Hint: In evaluating exponential terms, the function values increase very rapidly. To display very large (or very
          small) values, a calculator will use scientific notation. For example: 2.56 E6 is telling you to move the decimal point
          6 places to the right and to insert zeros where you have missing values.
          For example: 2.56 E6 = 2,560,000 or 2 million, five hundred, sixty thousand.

     5. The subsets you created in #1 are referred to as knowledge spaces in the field of learning science. In this context
          mastery of one concept may depend on your mastery of another.
          List one skill in mathematics that would help to master each of the following SLO's:
             · A = Graph the basic functions listed in the library of functions.
             · B = Find the domain of a function defined by an equation.
             · C = Create a new function through composition of functions.
             · D = Find linear functions that model data sets.

     6. Mastery of what are called linchpin topics will make it easier to learn other topics. For example, the ability to solve
          linear equations with variables on both sides can "unlock" a whole set of new skills for a student to master.
          List 3 other linchpin topics that would help you to master this math course. Discuss these with others in your class.

          when and where students need the help. Review of these important foundational ideas allow the learner to move
          on and master the student learning objectives for the course.
          Brainstorm ideas with your classmates about ways this corequisite support course could help you in your learning.

     A hardware store sells 16-ft ladders and 24-ft ladders. A window is located 12 feet above the ground. A ladder needs to
     be purchased that will reach the window from a point on the ground 5 feet from the building. To find out the length of
     ladder needed, we can draw a right triangle as shown in Figure 1, and use the Pythagorean Theorem.

                                                                                    Figure 1

     Now, we need to find out the length that, when squared, is 169, to determine which ladder to choose. In other words, we
     need to find a square root. In this section, we will investigate methods of finding solutions to problems such as this one.

Evaluating Square Roots

When the square root of a number is squared, the result is the original number. Since           the square root of is

The square root function is the inverse of the squaring function just as subtraction is the inverse of addition. To undo

squaring, we take the square root.

In general terms, if is a positive real number, then the square root of is a number that, when multiplied by itself,
gives The square root could be positive or negative because multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive
number. The principal square root is the nonnegative number that when multiplied by itself equals The square root
obtained using a calculator is the principal square root.

The principal square root of is written as The symbol is called a radical, the term under the symbol is called the
radicand, and the entire expression is called a radical expression.

Using the Product Rule to Simplify Square Roots

To simplify a square root, we rewrite it such that there are no perfect squares in the radicand. There are several

properties of square roots that allow us to simplify complicated radical expressions. The first rule we will look at is the

product rule for simplifying square roots, which allows us to separate the square root of a product of two numbers into

the product of two separate rational expressions. For instance, we can rewrite  as              We can also use the

product rule to express the product of multiple radical expressions as a single radical expression.

type such as square roots. For example, the sum of and  is             However, it is often possible to simplify radical

expressions, and that may change the radicand. The radical expression      can be written with a in the radicand, as

so

Rationalizing Denominators

When an expression involving square root radicals is written in simplest form, it will not contain a radical in the
denominator. We can remove radicals from the denominators of fractions using a process called rationalizing the
denominator.

We know that multiplying by 1 does not change the value of an expression. We use this property of multiplication to
change expressions that contain radicals in the denominator. To remove radicals from the denominators of fractions,
multiply by the form of 1 that will eliminate the radical.

For a denominator containing a single term, multiply by the radical in the denominator over itself. In other words, if the

denominator is      multiply by

For a denominator containing the sum or difference of a rational and an irrational term, multiply the numerator and

denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is found by changing the sign of the radical portion of the

denominator. If the denominator is  then the conjugate is

Using Rational Roots

Although square roots are the most common rational roots, we can also find cube roots, 4th roots, 5th roots, and more.
Just as the square root function is the inverse of the squaring function, these roots are the inverse of their respective
power functions. These functions can be useful when we need to determine the number that, when raised to a certain
power, gives a certain number.

Understanding nth Roots

Suppose we know that             We want to find what number raised to the 3rd power is equal to 8. Since  we say

that 2 is the cube root of 8.

The nth root of is a number that, when raised to the nth power, gives For example, is the 5th root of

because               If is a real number with at least one nth root, then the principal nth root of is the number

with the same sign as that, when raised to the nth power, equals

The principal nth root of is written as where is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. In the radical

Using Rational Exponents

Radical expressions can also be written without using the radical symbol. We can use rational (fractional) exponents.
The index must be a positive integer. If the index is even, then cannot be negative.

We can also have rational exponents with numerators other than 1. In these cases, the exponent must be a fraction in
lowest terms. We raise the base to a power and take an nth root. The numerator tells us the power and the denominator
tells us the root.

All of the properties of exponents that we learned for integer exponents also hold for rational exponents.

  Rational Exponents

  Rational exponents are another way to express principal nth roots. The general form for converting between a radical
  expression with a radical symbol and one with a rational exponent is

Objective 1: Distinguish between a fixed and a growth mindset, and how these ideas may help in
learning.

Stanford University psychologist and researcher, Carol Dweck, PH.D., published a book in 2006 called "Mindset, The New
Psychology of Success", which changed how many people think about their talents and abilities. Based on decades of
research Dr. Dweck outlined two mindsets and their influence on our learning.

Dr. Dweck's research found that people who believe that their abilities could change through learning and practice
(growth mindset) more readily accepted learning challenges and persisted through these challenges. While individuals
who believe that knowledge and abilities come from natural talent and cannot be changed (fixed mindset) more often
become discouraged by failure and do not persist.

Identifying the Degree and Leading Coefficient of Polynomials

The formula just found is an example of a polynomial, which is a sum of or difference of terms, each consisting of a

variable raised to a nonnegative integer power. A number multiplied by a variable raised to an exponent, such as

is known as a coefficient. Coefficients can be positive, negative, or zero, and can be whole numbers, decimals, or

fractions. Each product          such as  is a term of a polynomial. If a term does not contain a variable, it is called

a constant.

A polynomial containing only one term, such as      is called a monomial. A polynomial containing two terms, such as

We can find the degree of a polynomial by identifying the highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial.
The term with the highest degree is called the leading term because it is usually written first. The coefficient of the
leading term is called the leading coefficient. When a polynomial is written so that the powers are descending, we say
that it is in standard form.

Multiplying Polynomials

Multiplying polynomials is a bit more challenging than adding and subtracting polynomials. We must use the distributive
property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. We then combine like
terms. We can also use a shortcut called the FOIL method when multiplying binomials. Certain special products follow
patterns that we can memorize and use instead of multiplying the polynomials by hand each time. We will look at a
variety of ways to multiply polynomials.

Multiplying Polynomials Using the Distributive Property

To multiply a number by a polynomial, we use the distributive property. The number must be distributed to each term of

the polynomial. We can distribute the in  to obtain the equivalent expression  When multiplying

polynomials, the distributive property allows us to multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second.

We then add the products together and combine like terms to simplify.

We can use a table to keep track of our work, as shown in Table 1. Write one polynomial across the top and the other
down the side. For each box in the table, multiply the term for that row by the term for that column. Then add all of the
terms together, combine like terms, and simplify.

Using FOIL to Multiply Binomials

A shortcut called FOIL is sometimes used to find the product of two binomials. It is called FOIL because we multiply the
first terms, the outer terms, the inner terms, and then the last terms of each binomial.

The FOIL method arises out of the distributive property. We are simply multiplying each term of the first binomial by
each term of the second binomial, and then combining like terms.

             ...

                 HOW TO
  Given two binomials, use FOIL to simplify the expression.
   1. Multiply the first terms of each binomial.
   2. Multiply the outer terms of the binomials.
   3. Multiply the inner terms of the binomials.
   4. Multiply the last terms of each binomial.

    Perfect Square Trinomials

     Certain binomial products have special forms. When a binomial is squared, the result is called a perfect square
     trinomial. We can find the square by multiplying the binomial by itself. However, there is a special form that each of
     these perfect square trinomials takes, and memorizing the form makes squaring binomials much easier and faster. Let's
     look at a few perfect square trinomials to familiarize ourselves with the form.

     Notice that the first term of each trinomial is the square of the first term of the binomial and, similarly, the last term of
     each trinomial is the square of the last term of the binomial. The middle term is double the product of the two terms.
     Lastly, we see that the first sign of the trinomial is the same as the sign of the binomial.

        Perfect Square Trinomials
        When a binomial is squared, the result is the first term squared added to double the product of both terms and the
        last term squared.

Difference of Squares

Another special product is called the difference of squares, which occurs when we multiply a binomial by another

binomial with the same terms but the opposite sign. Let's see what happens when we multiply  using the

FOIL method.

The middle term drops out, resulting in a difference of squares. Just as we did with the perfect squares, let's look at a few
examples.

Because the sign changes in the second binomial, the outer and inner terms cancel each other out, and we are left only
with the square of the first term minus the square of the last term.

       Q&A Is there a special form for the sum of squares?
                    No. The difference of squares occurs because the opposite signs of the binomials cause the middle terms
                    to disappear. There are no two binomials that multiply to equal a sum of squares.

  Difference of Squares

  When a binomial is multiplied by a binomial with the same terms separated by the opposite sign, the result is the
  square of the first term minus the square of the last term.

Learning Objectives:

           Use the Cornell Process to study from your notes.

Objective 1: Master a proven technique for note taking: The Cornell Method.

The Cornell Method for taking notes was created by an education professor at Cornell University, Dr. Walter Pauk. The
Cornell Method consists of two strategies, a format for notetaking and then the process of using your notes to study.
The format for note taking involves separating out the pages of your notebook into three or four separate regions. This
method can help summarize information from a lecture, a video, or a reading from your text. You don't need to
purchase Cornell paper, just divide your sheets into regions like the illustration below. Write on just one side of the paper
so that you can later fold back the left column and quiz yourself using practice test questions.

The top portion is called the heading. This is where you write your name, the class, the date, the section of the text and a
main topic objective for the day.

The right section is where you will take notes during class. Try to summarize main ideas here without copying word for
word everything your teacher is saying. Use bullet points or numbers to prioritize important ideas. Include here the
definitions your teacher presents, and the examples worked in class. It is useful if you can group the content here by
learning objectives.

The left column about 2 inches wide is used to write questions about the main concepts that were covered in class. For
example, write sample test questions over the concepts discussed in class in this column. This is also where you should
write cues about the importance of the information including vocabulary terms, diagrams, formulas or the methods
being used to solve. If you like to sketch this is a place to add illustrations for key ideas or icons so you can quickly
identify certain components.

The summary will be written in the lower section about 2 inches from the bottom. You will complete this after class
summarizing the important concepts you were taught in a short compact way. Think of this summary as what you
might describe to a friend who happened to miss class that day. Reflect on the important ideas here. Add illustrations or
a mind map to your summary if this helps. You will use this section to find information later when studying.

Objective 2: Use the Cornell Process to study from your notes.

The Cornell Way. Using your Cornell notes to study is referred to as the Cornell Way.
The process includes Cornell note taking (presented in Objective 1), note making, note interacting, and note reflecting.
After taking notes in class, follow up with these study methods.
Note making: This is where you will fill in any gaps left in your Cornell notes meaning add in any missed details. Fill in
your question column with sample test questions, any formulas used, and highlight, circle or star important any
important ideas. Complete your summary row with a few sentences summarizing the important ideas. This should be
completed right after class or within the next day. Be creative and add some color, make these notes into something you
enjoy working with.
Note interacting: This is the ongoing process of studying from your notes. Fold your left question column back and ask
yourself the practice test questions. Include note interactions in the review for your exams. These note interactions can
be as short as 5 minutes in length but need to happen regularly and at least daily for the week before exams.
Note reflecting: This is where you assess how helpful your notes were. Do this right after you get back your graded
exam. Did the regular note interactions help you to perform better on the exam? Were there problems similar to those
you predicted on the exam? Enhance your notes with any important ideas you had initially left out. Then use what you
learn from this assessment to improve your note taking in the future.

Practice Makes Perfect

    Making, and Note Interacting steps outlined above. Keep these Cornell notes in your divided binder for the course
    so you can easily refer back when you encounter an exercise requiring factoring throughout the term.

3. Share these completed Cornell notes with your classmates. Fill in any gaps in your work. Work on each other's
    practice problems.

Imagine that we are trying to find the area of a lawn so that we can determine how much grass seed to purchase. The
lawn is the green portion in Figure 1.

                                                                              Figure 1
The area of the entire region can be found using the formula for the area of a rectangle.

The areas of the portions that do not require grass seed need to be subtracted from the area of the entire region. The

two square regions each have an area of            units2. The other rectangular region has one side of length

and one side of length giving an area of                                 units2. So the region that must be

Many polynomial expressions can be written in simpler forms by factoring. In this section, we will look at a variety of
methods that can be used to factor polynomial expressions.

Factoring the Greatest Common Factor of a Polynomial

When we study fractions, we learn that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest number that

divides evenly into both numbers. For instance, is the GCF of and because it is the largest number that divides

evenly into both and The GCF of polynomials works the same way: is the GCF of and                     because it is the

largest polynomial that divides evenly into both and

When factoring a polynomial expression, our first step should be to check for a GCF. Look for the GCF of the coefficients,
and then look for the GCF of the variables.

Greatest Common Factor

The greatest common factor (GCF) of polynomials is the largest polynomial that divides evenly into the polynomials.

              HOW TO

Given a polynomial expression, factor out the greatest common factor.

 1. Identify the GCF of the coefficients.
 2. Identify the GCF of the variables.
 3. Combine to find the GCF of the expression.
 4. Determine what the GCF needs to be multiplied by to obtain each term in the expression.
 5. Write the factored expression as the product of the GCF and the sum of the terms we need to multiply by.

Solution

First, find the GCF of the expression. The GCF of 6, 45, and 21 is 3. The GCF of  , and is . (Note that the GCF of a

set of expressions in the form will always be the exponent of lowest degree.) And the GCF of          , and is .

Combine these to find the GCF of the polynomial, .

Next, determine what the GCF needs to be multiplied by to obtain each term of the polynomial. We find that
                                                               , and

Finally, write the factored expression as the product of the GCF and the sum of the terms we needed to multiply by.

Factoring by Grouping

Trinomials with leading coefficients other than 1 are slightly more complicated to factor. For these trinomials, we can

factor by grouping by dividing the x term into the sum of two terms, factoring each portion of the expression

separately, and then factoring out the GCF of the entire expression. The trinomial          can be rewritten as

                      using this process. We begin by rewriting the original expression as  and then factor

each portion of the expression to obtain                       We then pull out the GCF of  to find the factored

expression.

Factoring a Perfect Square Trinomial

A perfect square trinomial is a trinomial that can be written as the square of a binomial. Recall that when a binomial is
squared, the result is the square of the first term added to twice the product of the two terms and the square of the last
term.

We can use this equation to factor any perfect square trinomial.

Factoring the Sum and Difference of Cubes

Now, we will look at two new special products: the sum and difference of cubes. Although the sum of squares cannot be
factored, the sum of cubes can be factored into a binomial and a trinomial.

Similarly, the difference of cubes can be factored into a binomial and a trinomial, but with different signs.

We can use the acronym SOAP to remember the signs when factoring the sum or difference of cubes. The first letter of
each word relates to the signs: Same Opposite Always Positive. For example, consider the following example.

The sign of the first 2 is the same as the sign between            The sign of the term is opposite the sign between

Multiplying Rational Expressions

Multiplication of rational expressions works the same way as multiplication of any other fractions. We multiply the
numerators to find the numerator of the product, and then multiply the denominators to find the denominator of the
product. Before multiplying, it is helpful to factor the numerators and denominators just as we did when simplifying
rational expressions. We are often able to simplify the product of rational expressions.

Dividing Rational Expressions

Division of rational expressions works the same way as division of other fractions. To divide a rational expression by
another rational expression, multiply the first expression by the reciprocal of the second. Using this approach, we would

rewrite  as the product            Once the division expression has been rewritten as a multiplication expression,

we can multiply as we did before.

Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions

Adding and subtracting rational expressions works just like adding and subtracting numerical fractions. To add fractions,
we need to find a common denominator. Let's look at an example of fraction addition.

We have to rewrite the fractions so they share a common denominator before we are able to add. We must do the same
thing when adding or subtracting rational expressions.

The easiest common denominator to use will be the least common denominator, or LCD. The LCD is the smallest

multiple that the denominators have in common. To find the LCD of two rational expressions, we factor the expressions

and multiply all of the distinct factors. For instance, if the factored denominators were  and

then the LCD would be

Once we find the LCD, we need to multiply each expression by the form of 1 that will change the denominator to the

LCD. We would need to multiply the expression with a denominator of              by        and the expression with a

denominator of                   by

...

     HOW TO

Given two rational expressions, add or subtract them.

 2. Find the LCD of the expressions.

Adding Rational Expressions
Add the rational expressions:

     Solution                                                  We then multiply each expression by the appropriate form

First, we have to find the LCD. In this case, the LCD will be
of 1 to obtain as the denominator for each fraction.

Now that the expressions have the same denominator, we simply add the numerators to find the sum.

     Analysis
Multiplying by or does not change the value of the original expression because any number divided by itself is 1,
and multiplying an expression by 1 gives the original expression.

Subtracting Rational Expressions
Subtract the rational expressions:

      Introduction to Equations and Inequalities

Irrigation is a critical aspect of agriculture, which can expand the yield of farms and enable farming in areas not naturally
viable for crops. But the materials, equipment, and the water itself are expensive and complex. To be efficient and
productive, farm owners and irrigation specialists must carefully lay out the network of pipes, pumps, and related
equipment. The available land can be divided into regular portions (similar to a grid), and the different sizes of irrigation
systems and conduits can be installed within the plotted area.

The first number of the coordinate pair is the x-coordinate, and the second number is the y-coordinate. To plot each

point, sketch a vertical line through the x-coordinate and a horizontal line through the y-coordinate. Their intersection

is the point.

       locations.

    Plotting Ordered Pairs in the Cartesian Coordinate System

       An old story describes how seventeenth-century philosopher/mathematician René Descartes, while sick in bed, invented
       the system that has become the foundation of algebra. According to the story, Descartes was staring at a fly crawling on
       the ceiling when he realized that he could describe the fly's location in relation to the perpendicular lines formed by the
       adjacent walls of his room. He viewed the perpendicular lines as horizontal and vertical axes. Further, by dividing each
       axis into equal unit lengths, Descartes saw that it was possible to locate any object in a two-dimensional plane using just
       two numbers--the displacement from the horizontal axis and the displacement from the vertical axis.

       While there is evidence that ideas similar to Descartes' grid system existed centuries earlier, it was Descartes who
       introduced the components that comprise the Cartesian coordinate system, a grid system having perpendicular axes.
      Descartes named the horizontal axis the x-axis and the vertical axis the y-axis.

       The Cartesian coordinate system, also called the rectangular coordinate system, is based on a two-dimensional plane
      consisting of the x-axis and the y-axis. Perpendicular to each other, the axes divide the plane into four sections. Each
       section is called a quadrant; the quadrants are numbered counterclockwise as shown in Figure 2

                                                  Figure 2

The center of the plane is the point at which the two axes cross. It is known as the origin, or point  From the origin,

each axis is further divided into equal units: increasing, positive numbers to the right on the x-axis and up the y-axis;

decreasing, negative numbers to the left on the x-axis and down the y-axis. The axes extend to positive and negative

infinity as shown by the arrowheads in Figure 3.

                                                  Figure 3

Each point in the plane is identified by its x-coordinate, or horizontal displacement from the origin, and its

y-coordinate, or vertical displacement from the origin. Together, we write them as an ordered pair indicating the

combined distance from the origin in the form     An ordered pair is also known as a coordinate pair because it

consists of x- and y-coordinates. For example, we can represent the point  in the plane by moving three units to

the right of the origin in the horizontal direction, and one unit down in the vertical direction. See Figure 4.

                                                                              Figure 4

When dividing the axes into equally spaced increments, note that the x-axis may be considered separately from the
y-axis. In other words, while the x-axis may be divided and labeled according to consecutive integers, the y-axis may be
divided and labeled by increments of 2, or 10, or 100. In fact, the axes may represent other units, such as years against
the balance in a savings account, or quantity against cost, and so on. Consider the rectangular coordinate system
primarily as a method for showing the relationship between two quantities.

Cartesian Coordinate System

A two-dimensional plane where the

· x-axis is the horizontal axis
· y-axis is the vertical axis

A point in the plane is defined as an ordered pair,      such that x is determined by its horizontal distance from the

origin and y is determined by its vertical distance from the origin.

EXAMPLE 1

Plotting Points in a Rectangular Coordinate System

Plot the points    and             in the plane.

Solution

To plot the point  begin at the origin. The x-coordinate is -2, so move two units to the left. The y-coordinate is 4,

so then move four units up in the positive y direction.

To plot the point  begin again at the origin. The x-coordinate is 3, so move three units to the right. The

y-coordinate is also 3, so move three units up in the positive y direction.

To plot the point  begin again at the origin. The x-coordinate is 0. This tells us not to move in either direction

along the x-axis. The y-coordinate is -3, so move three units down in the negative y direction. See the graph in Figure 5.

                                                         Figure 5
104 2 · Equations and Inequalities

     Analysis
Note that when either coordinate is zero, the point must be on an axis. If the x-coordinate is zero, the point is on the
y-axis. If the y-coordinate is zero, the point is on the x-axis.

Graphing Equations by Plotting Points

We can plot a set of points to represent an equation. When such an equation contains both an x variable and a y
variable, it is called an equation in two variables. Its graph is called a graph in two variables. Any graph on a two-
dimensional plane is a graph in two variables.

Suppose we want to graph the equation  We can begin by substituting a value for x into the equation and

determining the resulting value of y. Each pair of x- and y-values is an ordered pair that can be plotted. Table 1 lists

values of x from -3 to 3 and the resulting values for y.

                                                        Table 1
We can plot the points in the table. The points for this particular equation form a line, so we can connect them. See
Figure 6. This is not true for all equations.

                                                                              Figure 6
Note that the x-values chosen are arbitrary, regardless of the type of equation we are graphing. Of course, some
situations may require particular values of x to be plotted in order to see a particular result. Otherwise, it is logical to
choose values that can be calculated easily, and it is always a good idea to choose values that are both negative and
positive. There is no rule dictating how many points to plot, although we need at least two to graph a line. Keep in mind,
however, that the more points we plot, the more accurately we can sketch the graph.

Graphing Equations with a Graphing Utility

Most graphing calculators require similar techniques to graph an equation. The equations sometimes have to be

manipulated so they are written in the style  The TI-84 Plus, and many other calculator makes and models,

have a mode function, which allows the window (the screen for viewing the graph) to be altered so the pertinent parts of

a graph can be seen.

For example, the equation           has been entered in the TI-84 Plus shown in Figure 8a. In Figure 8b, the resulting

graph is shown. Notice that we cannot see on the screen where the graph crosses the axes. The standard window screen

on the TI-84 Plus shows             and       See Figure 8c.

        Figure 8 a. Enter the equation. b. This is the graph in the original window. c. These are the original settings.

By changing the window to show more of the positive x-axis and more of the negative y-axis, we have a much better
view of the graph and the x- and y-intercepts. See Figure 9a and Figure 9b.

     Figure 9 a. This screen shows the new window settings. b. We can clearly view the intercepts in the new window.
  EXAMPLE 3
Using a Graphing Utility to Graph an Equation
Use a graphing utility to graph the equation:

     Solution
Enter the equation in the y= function of the calculator. Set the window settings so that both the x- and y- intercepts are
showing in the window. See Figure 10.

Finding x-intercepts and y-intercepts

The intercepts of a graph are points at which the graph crosses the axes. The x-intercept is the point at which the
graph crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-coordinate is zero. The y-intercept is the point at which the graph crosses
the y-axis. At this point, the x-coordinate is zero.
To determine the x-intercept, we set y equal to zero and solve for x. Similarly, to determine the y-intercept, we set x
equal to zero and solve for y. For example, lets find the intercepts of the equation

Using the Distance Formula

Derived from the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance formula is used to find the distance between two points in the

plane. The Pythagorean Theorem,                         is based on a right triangle where a and b are the lengths of the legs

adjacent to the right angle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse. See Figure 13.

The relationship of sides                and            to side d is the same as that of sides a and b to side c. We use the

absolute value symbol to indicate that the length is a positive number because the absolute value of any number is

positive. (For example,                  ) The symbols  and        indicate that the lengths of the sides of the

triangle are positive. To find the length c, take the square root of both sides of the Pythagorean Theorem.

It follows that the distance formula is given as

We do not have to use the absolute value symbols in this definition because any number squared is positive.

     Solution
Let us first look at the graph of the two points. Connect the points to form a right triangle as in Figure 14.

                                                                             Figure 14

EXAMPLE 6

Finding the Distance between Two Locations
Let's return to the situation introduced at the beginning of this section.

Tracie set out from Elmhurst, IL, to go to Franklin Park. On the way, she made a few stops to do errands. Each stop is
indicated by a red dot in Figure 1. Find the total distance that Tracie traveled. Compare this with the distance between
her starting and final positions.

Solution

The first thing we should do is identify ordered pairs to describe each position. If we set the starting position at the

origin, we can identify each of the other points by counting units east (right) and north (up) on the grid. For example, the

first stop is 1 block east and 1 block north, so it is at  The next stop is 5 blocks to the east, so it is at  After

that, she traveled 3 blocks east and 2 blocks north to     Lastly, she traveled 4 blocks north to  We can label

these points on the grid as in Figure 15.

Next, we can calculate the distance. Note that each grid unit represents 1,000 feet.

· From her starting location to her first stop at     Tracie might have driven north 1,000 feet and then east 1,000

feet, or vice versa. Either way, she drove 2,000 feet to her first stop.

· Her second stop is at             So from  to       Tracie drove east 4,000 feet.

· Her third stop is at              There are a number of routes from         to  Whatever route Tracie decided to use,

the distance is the same, as there are no angular streets between the two points. Let's say she drove east 3,000 feet

and then north 2,000 feet for a total of 5,000 feet.

· Tracie's final stop is at         This is a straight drive north from        for a total of 4,000 feet.

Next, we will add the distances listed in Table 3.

                                             to                        5,000

                                    Table 3

The total distance Tracie drove is 15,000 feet, or 2.84 miles. This is not, however, the actual distance between her starting

and ending positions. To find this distance, we can use the distance formula between the points            and

At 1,000 feet per grid unit, the distance between Elmhurst, IL, to Franklin Park is 10,630.14 feet, or 2.01 miles. The

shortest distance between two points because a crow can fly in a straight line even though a person on the ground has

to travel a longer distance on existing roadways.

Using the Midpoint Formula

When the endpoints of a line segment are known, we can find the point midway between them. This point is known as

the midpoint and the formula is known as the midpoint formula. Given the endpoints of a line segment,        and

the midpoint formula states how to find the coordinates of the midpoint

A graphical view of a midpoint is shown in Figure 16. Notice that the line segments on either side of the midpoint are
congruent.

After graphing it, use the 2nd CALC button and 2:zero button, hit ENTER. At the lower part of the screen you will see "left

says "right bound?" Move the cursor to the right of the x-intercept, hit ENTER. Now it says "guess?" Move your cursor to
the left somewhere in between the left and right bound near the x-intercept. Hit ENTER. At the bottom of your screen it
will display the coordinates of the x-intercept or the "zero" to the y-value. Use this to find the x-intercept.

Note: With linear/straight line functions the zero is not really a "guess," but it is necessary to enter a "guess" so it will
search and find the exact x-intercept between your right and left boundaries. With other types of functions (more than
one x-intercept), they may be irrational numbers so "guess" is more appropriate to give it the correct limits to find a very
close approximation between the left and right boundaries.

Solving Linear Equations in One Variable

A linear equation is an equation of a straight line, written in one variable. The only power of the variable is 1. Linear

equations in one variable may take the form  and are solved using basic algebraic operations.

We begin by classifying linear equations in one variable as one of three types: identity, conditional, or inconsistent. An
identity equation is true for all values of the variable. Here is an example of an identity equation.

The solution set consists of all values that make the equation true. For this equation, the solution set is all real numbers
because any real number substituted for will make the equation true.

A conditional equation is true for only some values of the variable. For example, if we are to solve the equation
                        we have the following:

The solution set consists of one number:     It is the only solution and, therefore, we have solved a conditional
equation.

An inconsistent equation results in a false statement. For example, if we are to solve         we have the
following:

Indeed,  There is no solution because this is an inconsistent equation.

Solving linear equations in one variable involves the fundamental properties of equality and basic algebraic operations.

      thing to both sides of the equal sign. Note that we cannot divide by zero.

Solving a Rational Equation

In this section, we look at rational equations that, after some manipulation, result in a linear equation. If an equation
contains at least one rational expression, it is a considered a rational equation.

Recall that a rational number is the ratio of two numbers, such as or  A rational expression is the ratio, or quotient,
of two polynomials. Here are three examples.

Rational equations have a variable in the denominator in at least one of the terms. Our goal is to perform algebraic
operations so that the variables appear in the numerator. In fact, we will eliminate all denominators by multiplying both
sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD).

Finding the LCD is identifying an expression that contains the highest power of all of the factors in all of the
denominators. We do this because when the equation is multiplied by the LCD, the common factors in the LCD and in
each denominator will equal one and will cancel out.

EXAMPLE 3

Solving a Rational Equation
Solve the rational equation:

    Solution

We have three denominators;         and 3. The LCD must contain        and 3. An LCD of contains all three

denominators. In other words, each denominator can be divided evenly into the LCD. Next, multiply both sides of the

equation by the LCD

A common mistake made when solving rational equations involves finding the LCD when one of the denominators is a

binomial--two terms added or subtracted--such as         Always consider a binomial as an individual factor--the

terms cannot be separated. For example, suppose a problem has three terms and the denominators are          and

    First, factor all denominators. We then have         and           as the denominators. (Note the parentheses

placed around the second denominator.) Only the last two denominators have a common factor of       The in the

first denominator is separate from the in the     denominators. An effective way to remember this is to write

factored and binomial denominators in parentheses, and consider each parentheses as a separate unit or a separate

factor. The LCD in this instance is found by multiplying together the one factor of     and the 3. Thus, the LCD is

the following:

So, both sides of the equation would be multiplied by    Leave the LCD in factored form, as this makes it easier
to see how each denominator in the problem cancels out.

Another example is a problem with two denominators, such as and        Once the second denominator is factored

as                   there is a common factor of x in both denominators and the LCD is

Sometimes we have a rational equation in the form of a proportion; that is, when one fraction equals another fraction
and there are no other terms in the equation.

We can use another method of solving the equation without finding the LCD: cross-multiplication. We multiply terms by
crossing over the equal sign.

Multiply  and       which results in

Any solution that makes a denominator in the original expression equal zero must be excluded from the possibilities.

denominators.

              HOW TO

Given a rational equation, solve it.

 1. Factor all denominators in the equation.
 2. Find and exclude values that set each denominator equal to zero.
 3. Find the LCD.
 4. Multiply the whole equation by the LCD. If the LCD is correct, there will be no denominators left.
 5. Solve the remaining equation.
 6. Make sure to check solutions back in the original equations to avoid a solution producing zero in a denominator.

Perhaps the most familiar form of a linear equation is the slope-intercept form, written as                 where

and        Let us begin with the slope.

The Slope of a Line

The slope of a line refers to the ratio of the vertical change in y over the horizontal change in x between any two points
on a line. It indicates the direction in which a line slants as well as its steepness. Slope is sometimes described as rise
over run.

If the slope is positive, the line slants to the right. If the slope is negative, the line slants to the left. As the slope
increases, the line becomes steeper. Some examples are shown in Figure 2. The lines indicate the following slopes:

                      and

The slope of a line, m, represents the change in y over the change in x. Given two points,  and             the

following formula determines the slope of a line containing these points:

Analysis

The y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. On the y-axis,  We can always identify the

y-intercept when the line is in slope-intercept form, as it will always equal b. Or, just substitute  and solve for y.

The Point-Slope Formula

Given the slope and one point on a line, we can find the equation of the line using the point-slope formula.

This is an important formula, as it will be used in other areas of college algebra and often in calculus to find the equation
of a tangent line. We need only one point and the slope of the line to use the formula. After substituting the slope and
the coordinates of one point into the formula, we simplify it and write it in slope-intercept form.

  The Point-Slope Formula

  Given one point and the slope, the point-slope formula will lead to the equation of a line:

EXAMPLE 10

Finding the Equation of a Line Given the Slope and One Point

Write the equation of the line with slope  and passing through the point           Write the final equation in slope-

obtained.

     Analysis
To prove that either point can be used, let us use the second point

We see that the same line will be obtained using either point. This makes sense because we used both points to calculate
the slope.

Standard Form of a Line

Another way that we can represent the equation of a line is in standard form. Standard form is given as

where        and  are integers. The x- and y-terms are on one side of the equal sign and the constant term is on the

other side.

The equations of vertical and horizontal lines do not require any of the preceding formulas, although we can use the
formulas to prove that the equations are correct. The equation of a vertical line is given as

Many real-world applications can be modeled by linear equations. For example, a cell phone package may include a
monthly service fee plus a charge per minute of talk-time; it costs a widget manufacturer a certain amount to produce x
widgets per month plus monthly operating charges; a car rental company charges a daily fee plus an amount per mile
driven. These are examples of applications we come across every day that are modeled by linear equations. In this
section, we will set up and use linear equations to solve such problems.

Setting up a Linear Equation to Solve a Real-World Application

To set up or model a linear equation to fit a real-world application, we must first determine the known quantities and

define the unknown quantity as a variable. Then, we begin to interpret the words as mathematical expressions using

mathematical symbols. Let us use the car rental example above. In this case, a known cost, such as $0.10/mi, is

multiplied by an unknown quantity, the number of miles driven. Therefore, we can write  This expression

represents a variable cost because it changes according to the number of miles driven.

If a quantity is independent of a variable, we usually just add or subtract it, according to the problem. As these amounts
do not change, we call them fixed costs. Consider a car rental agency that charges $0.10/mi plus a daily fee of $50. We
can use these quantities to model an equation that can be used to find the daily car rental cost

When dealing with real-world applications, there are certain expressions that we can translate directly into math. Table 1

There are two cell phone companies that offer different packages. Company A charges a monthly service fee of $34 plus

 Write a linear equation that models the packages offered by both companies.

 If the average number of minutes used each month is 420, which company offers the better plan?
 How many minutes of talk-time would yield equal monthly statements from both companies?

     Solution

 The model for Company A can be written as  This includes the variable cost of                     plus the

monthly service charge of $34. Company B's package charges a higher monthly fee of $40, but a lower variable cost

If the average number of minutes used each month is 1,160, we have the following:

So, Company B offers the lower monthly cost of $86.40 as compared with the $92 monthly cost offered by Company A
when the average number of minutes used each month is 1,160.



If the average number of minutes used each month is 420, we have the following:

If the average number of minutes used each month is 420, then Company A offers a lower monthly cost of $55
compared to Company B's monthly cost of $56.80.



To answer the question of how many talk-time minutes would yield the same bill from both companies, we should

think about the problem in terms of  coordinates: At what point are both the x-value and the y-value equal? We

can find this point by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for x.

Check the x-value in each equation.
Therefore, a monthly average of 600 talk-time minutes renders the plans equal. See Figure 2

Using a Formula to Solve a Real-World Application

Many applications are solved using known formulas. The problem is stated, a formula is identified, the known quantities

are substituted into the formula, the equation is solved for the unknown, and the problem's question is answered.

Typically, these problems involve two equations representing two trips, two investments, two areas, and so on. Examples

of formulas include the area of a rectangular region,        the perimeter of a rectangle,   and the

volume of a rectangular solid,           When there are two unknowns, we find a way to write one in terms of the

other because we can solve for only one variable at a time.

Solving an Application Using a Formula
It takes Andrew 30 min to drive to work in the morning. He drives home using the same route, but it takes 10 min longer,
and he averages 10 mi/h less than in the morning. How far does Andrew drive to work?

Solution

This is a distance problem, so we can use the formula        where distance equals rate multiplied by time. Note that

when rate is given in mi/h, time must be expressed in hours. Consistent units of measurement are key to obtaining a

correct solution.

First, we identify the known and unknown quantities. Andrew's morning drive to work takes 30 min, or h at rate His
drive home takes 40 min, or h, and his speed averages 10 mi/h less than the morning drive. Both trips cover distance

   A table, such as Table 2, is often helpful for keeping track of information in these types of problems.

                                         Table 2

Write two equations, one for each trip.

As both equations equal the same distance, we set them equal to each other and solve for r.

We have solved for the rate of speed to work, 40 mph. Substituting 40 into the rate on the return trip yields 30 mi/h. Now
we can answer the question. Substitute the rate back into either equation and solve for d.

Solving a Perimeter Problem                      ft. The length is ft greater than the width. What are the dimensions
The perimeter of a rectangular outdoor patio is
of the patio?

Solution

The perimeter formula is standard:               We have two unknown quantities, length and width. However, we can

write the length in terms of the width as        Substitute the perimeter value and the expression for length into

the formula. It is often helpful to make a sketch and label the sides as in Figure 3.

                                                                              Figure 3
Now we can solve for the width and then calculate the length.

The dimensions are  ft and                 ft.

TRY IT #4           Find the dimensions of a rectangle given that the perimeter is      cm and the length is 1 cm more

Solving an Area Problem                                           in. more than the width. Find the area of the graph
The perimeter of a tablet of graph paper is 48 in. The length is
paper.

Solution

The standard formula for area is          however, we will solve the problem using the perimeter formula. The reason

we use the perimeter formula is because we know enough information about the perimeter that the formula will allow

us to solve for one of the unknowns. As both perimeter and area use length and width as dimensions, they are often

used together to solve a problem such as this one.

We know that the length is 6 in. more than the width, so we can write length as                Substitute the value of the
perimeter and the expression for length into the perimeter formula and find the length.

Now, we find the area given the dimensions of       in. and       in.

The area is in.2.

Find the dimensions of a shipping box given that the length is twice the width, the height is
1,600 in.3.

Solution

The formula for the volume of a box is given as               the product of length, width, and height. We are given that

and                 The volume is         cubic inches.

The dimensions are                  in.,  in., and       in.

     Analysis
Note that the square root of would result in a positive and a negative value. However, because we are describing
width, we can use only the positive result.

real numbers and so are called imaginary or complex. We will see complex solutions when we solve quadratic equations
whose graph does not touch the x-axis. Imaginary numbers are used in many real-life applications including the study of
electricity involving alternating current (AC) electronics. Wireless, cellular and radar technologies utilize imaginary
numbers. Electrical engineers use imaginary numbers to measure the amplitude and phase of electrical oscillations.

Discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot around 1980, the Mandelbrot Set is one of the most recognizable fractal images. The
image is built on the theory of self-similarity and the operation of iteration. Zooming in on a fractal image brings many
surprises, particularly in the high level of repetition of detail that appears as magnification increases. The equation that
generates this image turns out to be rather simple.
In order to better understand it, we need to become familiar with a new set of numbers. Keep in mind that the study of
mathematics continuously builds upon itself. Negative integers, for example, fill a void left by the set of positive integers.
The set of rational numbers, in turn, fills a void left by the set of integers. The set of real numbers fills a void left by the
set of rational numbers. Not surprisingly, the set of real numbers has voids as well. In this section, we will explore a set
of numbers that fills voids in the set of real numbers and find out how to work within it.

Expressing Square Roots of Negative Numbers as Multiples of

We know how to find the square root of any positive real number. In a similar way, we can find the square root of any
negative number. The difference is that the root is not real. If the value in the radicand is negative, the root is said to be
an imaginary number. The imaginary number is defined as the square root of

So, using properties of radicals,

We can write the square root of any negative number as a multiple of Consider the square root of

We use and not because the principal root of is the positive root.

A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number. A complex number is expressed in standard

form when written                   where is the real part and is the imaginary part. For example,  is a complex number.

So, too, is

Imaginary numbers differ from real numbers in that a squared imaginary number produces a negative real number.
Recall that when a positive real number is squared, the result is a positive real number and when a negative real number
is squared, the result is also a positive real number. Complex numbers consist of real and imaginary numbers.

Plotting a Complex Number on the Complex Plane

We cannot plot complex numbers on a number line as we might real numbers. However, we can still represent them
graphically. To represent a complex number, we need to address the two components of the number. We use the
complex plane, which is a coordinate system in which the horizontal axis represents the real component and the vertical
axis represents the imaginary component. Complex numbers are the points on the plane, expressed as ordered pairs

        where represents the coordinate for the horizontal axis and represents the coordinate for the vertical axis.

Let's consider the number          The real part of the complex number is and the imaginary part is 3. We plot the

ordered pair   to represent the complex number                  as shown in Figure 2.

Dividing Complex Numbers

Dividing two complex numbers is more complicated than adding, subtracting, or multiplying because we cannot divide

by an imaginary number, meaning that any fraction must have a real-number denominator to write the answer in

standard form  We need to find a term by which we can multiply the numerator and the denominator that will

eliminate the imaginary portion of the denominator so that we end up with a real number as the denominator. This term

is called the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the

complex number. In other words, the complex conjugate of  is  For example, the product of  and

The result is a real number.

Note that complex conjugates have an opposite relationship: The complex conjugate of  is        and the complex

conjugate of       is         Further, when a quadratic equation with real coefficients has complex solutions, the

solutions are always complex conjugates of one another.

Suppose we want to divide         by     where neither nor equals zero. We first write the division as a fraction,

then find the complex conjugate of the denominator, and multiply.

Multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.

Apply the distributive property.

The Complex Conjugate

The complex conjugate of a complex number       is       It is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part

of the complex number. The real part of the number is left unchanged.

  · When a complex number is multiplied by its complex conjugate, the result is a real number.
  · When a complex number is added to its complex conjugate, the result is a real number.

Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring

An equation containing a second-degree polynomial is called a quadratic equation. For example, equations such as

and                                 are quadratic equations. They are used in countless ways in the fields of engineering,

architecture, finance, biological science, and, of course, mathematics.

Often the easiest method of solving a quadratic equation is factoring. Factoring means finding expressions that can be
multiplied together to give the expression on one side of the equation.

If a quadratic equation can be factored, it is written as a product of linear terms. Solving by factoring depends on the

zero-product property, which states that if  then            or          where a and b are real numbers or algebraic

expressions. In other words, if the product of two numbers or two expressions equals zero, then one of the numbers or

one of the expressions must equal zero because zero multiplied by anything equals zero.

Multiplying the factors expands the equation to a string of terms separated by plus or minus signs. So, in that sense, the
operation of multiplication undoes the operation of factoring. For example, expand the factored expression

                     by multiplying the two factors together.

The product is a quadratic expression. Set equal to zero,                is a quadratic equation. If we were to factor the
equation, we would get back the factors we multiplied.

The process of factoring a quadratic equation depends on the leading coefficient, whether it is 1 or another integer. We

will look at both situations; but first, we want to confirm that the equation is written in standard form,

where a, b, and c are real numbers, and      The equation                is in standard form.

We can use the zero-product property to solve quadratic equations in which we first have to factor out the greatest
common factor (GCF), and for equations that have special factoring formulas as well, such as the difference of squares,
both of which we will see later in this section.

When there is no linear term in the equation, another method of solving a quadratic equation is by using the square

sign. Keep in mind that sometimes we may have to manipulate the equation to isolate the term so that the square

Completing the Square

Not all quadratic equations can be factored or can be solved in their original form using the square root property. In
these cases, we may use a method for solving a quadratic equation known as completing the square. Using this
method, we add or subtract terms to both sides of the equation until we have a perfect square trinomial on one side of
the equal sign. We then apply the square root property. To complete the square, the leading coefficient, a, must equal 1.
If it does not, then divide the entire equation by a. Then, we can use the following procedures to solve a quadratic
equation by completing the square.

We will use the example                  to illustrate each step.

The fourth method of solving a quadratic equation is by using the quadratic formula, a formula that will solve all
quadratic equations. Although the quadratic formula works on any quadratic equation in standard form, it is easy to
make errors in substituting the values into the formula. Pay close attention when substituting, and use parentheses
when inserting a negative number.

We can derive the quadratic formula by completing the square. We will assume that the leading coefficient is positive; if

it is negative, we can multiply the equation by and obtain a positive a. Given  we will

complete the square as follows:

1. First, move the constant term to the right side of the equal sign:

We have solved linear equations, rational equations, and quadratic equations using several methods. However, there are
many other types of equations, and we will investigate a few more types in this section. We will look at equations
involving rational exponents, polynomial equations, radical equations, absolute value equations, equations in quadratic
form, and some rational equations that can be transformed into quadratics. Solving any equation, however, employs the
same basic algebraic rules. We will learn some new techniques as they apply to certain equations, but the algebra never
changes.

exponents is a useful skill, as it is highly applicable in calculus.

We can solve equations in which a variable is raised to a rational exponent by raising both sides of the equation to the
reciprocal of the exponent. The reason we raise the equation to the reciprocal of the exponent is because we want to
eliminate the exponent on the variable term, and a number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. For example,

       First, put the variable terms on one side of the equal sign and set the equation equal to zero.

       Now, it looks like we should factor the left side, but what do we factor out? We can always factor the term with the lowest

       Where did come from? Remember, when we multiply two numbers with the same base, we add the exponents.
       Therefore, if we multiply back in using the distributive property, we get the expression we had before the factoring,
      which is what should happen. We need an exponent such that when added to equals Thus, the exponent on x in

equations, which are equations that contain a string of terms including numerical coefficients and variables. When we

back. It does not cross the x-axis. This is typical of double solutions.

      Solve a polynomial by grouping:

            Solution
      This polynomial consists of 4 terms, which we can solve by grouping. Grouping procedures require factoring the first two
      terms and then factoring the last two terms. If the factors in the parentheses are identical, we can continue the process
      and solve, unless more factoring is suggested.

The grouping process ends here, as we can factor        using the difference of squares formula.

The solutions are  and Note that the highest exponent is 3 and we obtained 3 solutions. We can see the

     Analysis
We looked at solving quadratic equations by factoring when the leading coefficient is 1. When the leading coefficient is
not 1, we solved by grouping. Grouping requires four terms, which we obtained by splitting the linear term of quadratic
equations. We can also use grouping for some polynomials of degree higher than 2, as we saw here, since there were
already four terms.

Solving Radical Equations

Radical equations are equations that contain variables in the radicand (the expression under a radical symbol), such as

Radical equations may have one or more radical terms, and are solved by eliminating each radical, one at a time. We
have to be careful when solving radical equations, as it is not unusual to find extraneous solutions, roots that are not, in
fact, solutions to the equation. These solutions are not due to a mistake in the solving method, but result from the
process of raising both sides of an equation to a power. However, checking each answer in the original equation will
confirm the true solutions.

  Given a radical equation, solve it.
   1. Isolate the radical expression on one side of the equal sign. Put all remaining terms on the other side.
   2. If the radical is a square root, then square both sides of the equation. If it is a cube root, then raise both sides of

        the equation to the third power. In other words, for an nth root radical, raise both sides to the nth power. Doing

Solving Other Types of Equations

There are many other types of equations in addition to the ones we have discussed so far. We will see more of them
throughout the text. Here, we will discuss equations that are in quadratic form, and rational equations that result in a
quadratic.

Solving Equations in Quadratic Form

Equations in quadratic form are equations with three terms. The first term has a power other than 2. The middle term
has an exponent that is one-half the exponent of the leading term. The third term is a constant. We can solve equations
in this form as if they were quadratic. A few examples of these equations include

and                     In each one, doubling the exponent of the middle term equals the exponent on the leading

term. We can solve these equations by substituting a variable for the middle term.

Quadratic Form

If the exponent on the middle term is one-half of the exponent on the leading term, we have an equation in
quadratic form, which we can solve as if it were a quadratic. We substitute a variable for the middle term to solve
equations in quadratic form.

              HOW TO

Given an equation quadratic in form, solve it.

 1. Identify the exponent on the leading term and determine whether it is double the exponent on the middle term.
 2. If it is, substitute a variable, such as u, for the variable portion of the middle term.
 3. Rewrite the equation so that it takes on the standard form of a quadratic.
 4. Solve using one of the usual methods for solving a quadratic.

It is not easy to make the honor roll at most top universities. Suppose students were required to carry a course load of at
least 12 credit hours and maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or above. How could these honor roll requirements be
expressed mathematically? In this section, we will explore various ways to express different sets of numbers,
inequalities, and absolute value inequalities.

Using Interval Notation                                can be achieved in several ways.

Indicating the solution to an inequality such as

We can use a number line as shown in Figure 2. The blue ray begins at  and, as indicated by the arrowhead,

continues to infinity, which illustrates that the solution set includes all real numbers greater than or equal to 4.

                                                       Figure 2

We can use set-builder notation:  which translates to "all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal

to 4." Notice that braces are used to indicate a set.

The third method is interval notation, in which solution sets are indicated with parentheses or brackets. The solutions

to  are represented as  This is perhaps the most useful method, as it applies to concepts studied later in

this course and to other higher-level math courses.

The main concept to remember is that parentheses represent solutions greater or less than the number, and brackets

represent solutions that are greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the number. Use parentheses to represent

infinity or negative infinity, since positive and negative infinity are not numbers in the usual sense of the word and,

therefore, cannot be "equaled." A few examples of an interval, or a set of numbers in which a solution falls, are

or all numbers between and including but not including                 all real numbers between, but not including

    and and   all real numbers less than and including Table 1 outlines the possibilities.

want to combine these two sets. We accomplish this by inserting the union symbol, between the two intervals.

Using the Properties of Inequalities

When we work with inequalities, we can usually treat them similarly to but not exactly as we treat equalities. We can use
the addition property and the multiplication property to help us solve them. The one exception is when we multiply or
divide by a negative number; doing so reverses the inequality symbol.

These properties also apply to                        and

Understanding Compound Inequalities

A compound inequality includes two inequalities in one statement. A statement such as       means                       and

There are two ways to solve compound inequalities: separating them into two separate inequalities or leaving the

compound inequality intact and performing operations on all three parts at the same time. We will illustrate both

methods.

EXAMPLE 7

Solving a Compound Inequality

Solution

The first method is to write two separate inequalities:  and                              We solve them independently.

Then, we can rewrite the solution as a compound inequality, the same way the problem began.

Solving Absolute Value Inequalities

As we know, the absolute value of a quantity is a positive number or zero. From the origin, a point located at         has

an absolute value of as it is x units away. Consider absolute value as the distance from one point to another point.

Regardless of direction, positive or negative, the distance between the two points is represented as a positive number or

zero.

An absolute value inequality is an equation of the form
196 2 · Equations and Inequalities

Where A, and sometimes B, represents an algebraic expression dependent on a variable x. Solving the inequality means
finding the set of all -values that satisfy the problem. Usually this set will be an interval or the union of two intervals
and will include a range of values.

There are two basic approaches to solving absolute value inequalities: graphical and algebraic. The advantage of the
graphical approach is we can read the solution by interpreting the graphs of two equations. The advantage of the
algebraic approach is that solutions are exact, as precise solutions are sometimes difficult to read from a graph.

Suppose we want to know all possible returns on an investment if we could earn some amount of money within $200 of

$600. We can solve algebraically for the set of x-values such that the distance between and 600 is less than or equal to

200. We represent the distance between and 600 as  and therefore,                       or

This means our returns would be between $400 and $800.

To solve absolute value inequalities, just as with absolute value equations, we write two inequalities and then solve them
independently.

Absolute Value Inequalities

For an algebraic expression X, and       an absolute value inequality is an inequality of the form

These statements also apply to           and

  EXAMPLE 9

Determining a Number within a Prescribed Distance
Describe all values within a distance of 4 from the number 5.

     Solution
We want the distance between and 5 to be less than or equal to 4. We can draw a number line, such as in Figure 4, to
represent the condition to be satisfied.

                                                                              Figure 4  Write the values of that satisfy

The distance from to 5 can be represented using an absolute value symbol,
the condition as an absolute value inequality.

We need to write two inequalities as there are always two solutions to an absolute value equation.

If the solution set is              and   then the solution set is an interval including all real numbers between and
                                         in interval notation.

the x-axis. Notice that it is not important exactly what the graph looks like, as long as we know that it crosses the

horizontal axis at     and            and that the graph opens downward. See Figure 5.

Key Concepts

2.1 The Rectangular Coordinate Systems and Graphs

· We can locate, or plot, points in the Cartesian coordinate system using ordered pairs, which are defined as
   displacement from the x-axis and displacement from the y-axis. See Example 1.

· An equation can be graphed in the plane by creating a table of values and plotting points. See Example 2.
· Using a graphing calculator or a computer program makes graphing equations faster and more accurate. Equations

   usually have to be entered in the form y=_____. See Example 3.
· Finding the x- and y-intercepts can define the graph of a line. These are the points where the graph crosses the

    axes. See Example 4.
· The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem and is used to find the length of a line segment. See

    Example 5 and Example 6.
· The midpoint formula provides a method of finding the coordinates of the midpoint dividing the sum of the

   x-coordinates and the sum of the y-coordinates of the endpoints by 2. See Example 7 and Example 8.

2.2 Linear Equations in One Variable

· We can solve linear equations in one variable in the form      using standard algebraic properties. See

Example 1 and Example 2.

· A rational expression is a quotient of two polynomials. We use the LCD to clear the fractions from an equation. See

Example 3 and Example 4.

· All solutions to a rational equation should be verified within the original equation to avoid an undefined term, or

zero in the denominator. See Example 5 and Example 6 and Example 7.

· Given two points, we can find the slope of a line using the slope formula. See Example 8.

· We can identify the slope and y-intercept of an equation in slope-intercept form. See Example 9.

· We can find the equation of a line given the slope and a point. See Example 10.

· We can also find the equation of a line given two points. Find the slope and use the point-slope formula. See

Example 11.

· The standard form of a line has no fractions. See Example 12.

· Horizontal lines have a slope of zero and are defined as       where c is a constant.

· Vertical lines have an undefined slope (zero in the denominator), and are defined as       where c is a constant.

See Example 13.

· Parallel lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts. See Example 14 and Example 15.

· Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other unless one is horizontal and the other is

vertical. See Example 16.

2.3 Models and Applications

· A linear equation can be used to solve for an unknown in a number problem. See Example 1.

· Applications can be written as mathematical problems by identifying known quantities and assigning a variable to

unknown quantities. See Example 2.

· There are many known formulas that can be used to solve applications. Distance problems, for example, are solved

using the               formula. See Example 3.

· Many geometry problems are solved using the perimeter formula                    the area formula              or the

volume formula           See Example 4, Example 5, and Example 6.

2.4 Complex Numbers

· The square root of any negative number can be written as a multiple of See Example 1.
· To plot a complex number, we use two number lines, crossed to form the complex plane. The horizontal axis is the

    real axis, and the vertical axis is the imaginary axis. See Example 2.
· Complex numbers can be added and subtracted by combining the real parts and combining the imaginary parts.

    See Example 3.
· Complex numbers can be multiplied and divided.

     To multiply complex numbers, distribute just as with polynomials. See Example 4 and Example 5.
     To divide complex numbers, multiply both numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the

        denominator to eliminate the complex number from the denominator. See Example 6 and Example 7.

· The powers of are cyclic, repeating every fourth one. See Example 8.

2.5 Quadratic Equations

· Many quadratic equations can be solved by factoring when the equation has a leading coefficient of 1 or if the
    equation is a difference of squares. The zero-product property is then used to find solutions. See Example 1,
    Example 2, and Example 3.

· Many quadratic equations with a leading coefficient other than 1 can be solved by factoring using the grouping
    method. See Example 4 and Example 5.

· Another method for solving quadratics is the square root property. The variable is squared. We isolate the squared
    term and take the square root of both sides of the equation. The solution will yield a positive and negative solution.
    See Example 6 and Example 7.

· Completing the square is a method of solving quadratic equations when the equation cannot be factored. See
    Example 8.

· A highly dependable method for solving quadratic equations is the quadratic formula, based on the coefficients and
    the constant term in the equation. See Example 9 and Example 10.

· The discriminant is used to indicate the nature of the roots that the quadratic equation will yield: real or complex,
    rational or irrational, and how many of each. See Example 11.

· The Pythagorean Theorem, among the most famous theorems in history, is used to solve right-triangle problems
    and has applications in numerous fields. Solving for the length of one side of a right triangle requires solving a
    quadratic equation. See Example 12.

2.6 Other Types of Equations

· Rational exponents can be rewritten several ways depending on what is most convenient for the problem. To solve,
    both sides of the equation are raised to a power that will render the exponent on the variable equal to 1. See
    Example 1, Example 2, and Example 3.

· Factoring extends to higher-order polynomials when it involves factoring out the GCF or factoring by grouping. See
    Example 4 and Example 5.

· We can solve radical equations by isolating the radical and raising both sides of the equation to a power that
    matches the index. See Example 6 and Example 7.

· To solve absolute value equations, we need to write two equations, one for the positive value and one for the
    negative value. See Example 8.

· Equations in quadratic form are easy to spot, as the exponent on the first term is double the exponent on the
    second term and the third term is a constant. We may also see a binomial in place of the single variable. We use
    substitution to solve. See Example 9 and Example 10.

· Solving a rational equation may also lead to a quadratic equation or an equation in quadratic form. See Example 11.

2.7 Linear Inequalities and Absolute Value Inequalities

· Interval notation is a method to indicate the solution set to an inequality. Highly applicable in calculus, it is a system
    of parentheses and brackets that indicate what numbers are included in a set and whether the endpoints are
    included as well. See Table 1 and Example 2.

· Solving inequalities is similar to solving equations. The same algebraic rules apply, except for one: multiplying or
    dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality. See Example 3, Example 4, Example 5, and Example 6.

· Compound inequalities often have three parts and can be rewritten as two independent inequalities. Solutions are
    given by boundary values, which are indicated as a beginning boundary or an ending boundary in the solutions to
    the two inequalities. See Example 7 and Example 8.
204 2 · Exercises

  · Absolute value inequalities will produce two solution sets due to the nature of absolute value. We solve by writing
      two equations: one equal to a positive value and one equal to a negative value. See Example 9 and Example 10.

  · Absolute value inequalities can also be solved by graphing. At least we can check the algebraic solutions by
      graphing, as we cannot depend on a visual for a precise solution. See Example 11.

      Introduction to Functions

Toward the end of the twentieth century, the values of stocks of Internet and technology companies rose dramatically.
As a result, the Standard and Poor's stock market average rose as well. The graph above tracks the value of that initial
investment of just under $100 over the 40 years. It shows that an investment that was worth less than $500 until about
1995 skyrocketed up to about $1100 by the beginning of 2000. That five-year period became known as the "dot-com
bubble" because so many Internet startups were formed. As bubbles tend to do, though, the dot-com bubble eventually
burst. Many companies grew too fast and then suddenly went out of business. The result caused the sharp decline
represented on the graph beginning at the end of 2000.

Notice, as we consider this example, that there is a definite relationship between the year and stock market average. For
any year we choose, we can determine the corresponding value of the stock market average. In this chapter, we will
explore these kinds of relationships and their properties.

     Objective 1: Find the value of a function (IA 3.5.3)

       A relation is any set of ordered pairs, (x,y). The collection of x-values in the ordered pairs together make up the domain.
       The collection of y-values in the ordered pairs together make up the range.
       A special type of relation, called a function, is studied extensively in mathematics. A function is a relation that assigns to
       each element in its domain exactly one element in the range. For each ordered pair in the relation, each x-value is
       matched with only one y-value.

         Function Notation

         For the function

We read     as f of x or the value of f at x.

Representation of Functions,

There are many ways to represent functions including:

  · Equations
  · Tables of input and output values
  · Collections of ordered pairs, or points (x,y) = (independent variable, dependent variable)

A jetliner changes altitude as its distance from the starting point of a flight increases. The weight of a growing child
increases with time. In each case, one quantity depends on another. There is a relationship between the two quantities
that we can describe, analyze, and use to make predictions. In this section, we will analyze such relationships.

Determining Whether a Relation Represents a Function

A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The set of the first components of each ordered pair is called the domain and the set
of the second components of each ordered pair is called the range. Consider the following set of ordered pairs. The first
numbers in each pair are the first five natural numbers. The second number in each pair is twice that of the first.

The domain is    The range is

Note that each value in the domain is also known as an input value, or independent variable, and is often labeled with
the lowercase letter Each value in the range is also known as an output value, or dependent variable, and is often
labeled lowercase letter

A function is a relation that assigns a single value in the range to each value in the domain. In other words, no x-values

are repeated. For our example that relates the first five natural numbers to numbers double their values, this relation is

a function because each element in the domain,                   is paired with exactly one element in the range,

Now let's consider the set of ordered pairs that relates the terms "even" and "odd" to the first five natural numbers. It
would appear as

Notice that each element in the domain,             is not paired with exactly one element in the range,

               For example, the term "odd" corresponds to three values from the range,  and the term

"even" corresponds to two values from the range,       This violates the definition of a function, so this relation is not

a function.
214 3 · Functions

       Figure 1 compares relations that are functions and not functions.

       Figure 1 (a) This relationship is a function because each input is associated with a single output. Note that input and
       both give output (b) This relationship is also a function. In this case, each input is associated with a single output. (c)
       This relationship is not a function because input is associated with two different outputs.

         Function
         A function is a relation in which each possible input value leads to exactly one output value. We say "the output is a
         function of the input."
         The input values make up the domain, and the output values make up the range.

                      ...

                        HOW TO
         Given a relationship between two quantities, determine whether the relationship is a function.
          1. Identify the input values.
          2. Identify the output values.
          3. If each input value leads to only one output value, classify the relationship as a function. If any input value leads

               to two or more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.

         EXAMPLE 1
       Determining If Menu Price Lists Are Functions
       The coffee shop menu, shown below, consists of items and their prices.

     Is price a function of the item?
     Is the item a function of the price?

            Solution

     Let's begin by considering the input as the items on the menu. The output values are then the prices.

Each item on the menu has only one price, so the price is a function of the item.

 Two items on the menu have the same price. If we consider the prices to be the input values and the items to be the

output, then the same input value could have more than one output associated with it. See the image below.

Therefore, the item is a not a function of price.

  EXAMPLE 2

Determining If Class Grade Rules Are Functions
In a particular math class, the overall percent grade corresponds to a grade point average. Is grade point average a
function of the percent grade? Is the percent grade a function of the grade point average? Table 1 shows a possible rule
for assigning grade points.

Percent grade  0-56 57-61 62-66 67-71 72-77 78-86 87-91 92-100

Grade point average 0.0                            1.0  1.5      2.0    2.5        3.0  3.5  4.0

Table 1

     Solution
For any percent grade earned, there is an associated grade point average, so the grade point average is a function of the
percent grade. In other words, if we input the percent grade, the output is a specific grade point average.

In the grading system given, there is a range of percent grades that correspond to the same grade point average. For
example, students who receive a grade point average of 3.0 could have a variety of percent grades ranging from 78 all
the way to 86. Thus, percent grade is not a function of grade point average.

Using Function Notation

Once we determine that a relationship is a function, we need to display and define the functional relationships so that
we can understand and use them, and sometimes also so that we can program them into computers. There are various
ways of representing functions. A standard function notation is one representation that facilitates working with
functions.

To represent "height is a function of age," we start by identifying the descriptive variables for height and for age. The

letters            and are often used to represent functions just as we use     and to represent numbers and

and to represent sets.

Remember, we can use any letter to name the function; the notation              shows us that depends on The value

must be put into the function to get a result. The parentheses indicate that age is input into the function; they do not

indicate multiplication.

We can also give an algebraic expression as the input to a function. For example      means "first add a and b, and

the result is the input for the function f." The operations must be performed in this order to obtain the correct result.

Function Notation

The notation              defines a function named This is read as is a function of The letter represents the

input value, or independent variable. The letter or  represents the output value, or dependent variable.

EXAMPLE 3

Using Function Notation for Days in a Month
Use function notation to represent a function whose input is the name of a month and output is the number of days in
that month. Assume that the domain does not include leap years.

Solution

The number of days in a month is a function of the name of the month, so if we name the function we write

                   or     The name of the month is the input to a "rule" that associates a specific number (the

output) with each input.

For example,                  because March has 31 days. The notation             reminds us that the number of days,

(the output), is dependent on the name of the month, (the input).

     Analysis
Note that the inputs to a function do not have to be numbers; function inputs can be names of people, labels of
geometric objects, or any other element that determines some kind of output. However, most of the functions we will
work with in this book will have numbers as inputs and outputs.

TRY IT #2 Use function notation to express the weight of a pig in pounds as a function of its age in days

Q&A           Instead of a notation such as                could we use the same symbol for the output as for the

              function, such as  meaning "y is a function of x?"

              Yes, this is often done, especially in applied subjects that use higher math, such as physics and

              engineering. However, in exploring math itself we like to maintain a distinction between a function such

              as which is a rule or procedure, and the output we get by applying to a particular input This is

              why we usually use notation such as                      and so on.

Representing Functions Using Tables

A common method of representing functions is in the form of a table. The table rows or columns display the
corresponding input and output values. In some cases, these values represent all we know about the relationship; other
times, the table provides a few select examples from a more complete relationship.

Table 3 lists the input number of each month (January = 1, February = 2, and so on) and the output value of the number

of days in that month. This information represents all we know about the months and days for a given year (that is not a

leap year). Note that, in this table, we define a days-in-a-month function where        identifies months by an

integer rather than by name.

            Month number, (input) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

Table 5 displays the age of children in years and their corresponding heights. This table displays just some of the data

Table 6 and Table 7 define functions. In both, each input value corresponds to exactly one output value. Table 8 does not

notation.

Finding Input and Output Values of a Function

When we know an input value and want to determine the corresponding output value for a function, we evaluate the
function. Evaluating will always produce one result because each input value of a function corresponds to exactly one
output value.

When we know an output value and want to determine the input values that would produce that output value, we set
the output equal to the function's formula and solve for the input. Solving can produce more than one solution because
different input values can produce the same output value.

Evaluation of Functions in Algebraic Forms

When we have a function in formula form, it is usually a simple matter to evaluate the function. For example, the

function                   can be evaluated by squaring the input value, multiplying by 3, and then subtracting the

product from 5.

even though the formula cannot be written explicitly.

Evaluating a Function Given in Tabular Form

As we saw above, we can represent functions in tables. Conversely, we can use information in tables to write functions,
and we can evaluate functions using the tables. For example, how well do our pets recall the fond memories we share
with them? There is an urban legend that a goldfish has a memory of 3 seconds, but this is just a myth. Goldfish can
remember up to 3 months, while the beta fish has a memory of up to 5 months. And while a puppy's memory span is no
longer than 30 seconds, the adult dog can remember for 5 minutes. This is meager compared to a cat, whose memory
span lasts for 16 hours.

The function that relates the type of pet to the duration of its memory span is more easily visualized with the use of a
table. See Table 10.2

Pet        Memory span in hours

Puppy      0.008

Adult dog  0.083

Cat        16

Goldfish   2160

Beta fish  3600

Table 10

At times, evaluating a function in table form may be more useful than using equations.Here let us call the function
The domain of the function is the type of pet and the range is a real number representing the number of hours the pet's
memory span lasts. We can evaluate the function at the input value of "goldfish." We would write
Notice that, to evaluate the function in table form, we identify the input value and the corresponding output value from
the pertinent row of the table. The tabular form for function seems ideally suited to this function, more so than writing
it in paragraph or function form.

             ...

                 HOW TO

 1. Find the given input in the row (or column) of input values.
 2. Identify the corresponding output value paired with that input value.

Determining Whether a Function is One-to-One

Some functions have a given output value that corresponds to two or more input values. For example, in the stock chart
shown in the figure at the beginning of this chapter, the stock price was $1000 on five different dates, meaning that
there were five different input values that all resulted in the same output value of $1000.

However, some functions have only one input value for each output value, as well as having only one output for each
input. We call these functions one-to-one functions. As an example, consider a school that uses only letter grades and
decimal equivalents, as listed in Table 12.

                          Letter grade Grade point average

                                 A                          4.0

                                 B                          3.0

                                 C                          2.0

                                 D                          1.0

                          Table 12

This grading system represents a one-to-one function, because each letter input yields one particular grade point
average output and each grade point average corresponds to one input letter.
226 3 · Functions

       To visualize this concept, let's look again at the two simple functions sketched in Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b). The
       function in part (a) shows a relationship that is not a one-to-one function because inputs and both give output The
       function in part (b) shows a relationship that is a one-to-one function because each input is associated with a single
       output.

         One-to-One Function

         A one-to-one function is a function in which each output value corresponds to exactly one input value.

Using the Vertical Line Test

As we have seen in some examples above, we can represent a function using a graph. Graphs display a great many
input-output pairs in a small space. The visual information they provide often makes relationships easier to understand.
By convention, graphs are typically constructed with the input values along the horizontal axis and the output values
along the vertical axis.

The most common graphs name the input value and the output value and we say is a function of or

when the function is named The graph of the function is the set of all points               in the plane that satisfies the

equation       If the function is defined for only a few input values, then the graph of the function is only a few

points, where the x-coordinate of each point is an input value and the y-coordinate of each point is the corresponding

output value. For example, the black dots on the graph in Figure 7 tell us that             and  However, the set

of all points  satisfying        is a curve. The curve shown includes                  and  because the curve passes

The vertical line test can be used to determine whether a graph represents a function. If we can draw any vertical line
that intersects a graph more than once, then the graph does not define a function because a function has only one
output value for each input value. See Figure 8.

       can conclude that these two graphs represent functions. The third graph does not represent a function because, at most
       x-values, a vertical line would intersect the graph at more than one point, as shown in Figure 10.

Identifying Basic Toolkit Functions

In this text, we will be exploring functions--the shapes of their graphs, their unique characteristics, their algebraic

formulas, and how to solve problems with them. When learning to read, we start with the alphabet. When learning to do

arithmetic, we start with numbers. When working with functions, it is similarly helpful to have a base set of building-

block elements. We call these our "toolkit functions," which form a set of basic named functions for which we know the

graph, formula, and special properties. Some of these functions are programmed to individual buttons on many

calculators. For these definitions we will use as the input variable and  as the output variable.

We will see these toolkit functions, combinations of toolkit functions, their graphs, and their transformations frequently
throughout this book. It will be very helpful if we can recognize these toolkit functions and their features quickly by
name, formula, graph, and basic table properties. The graphs and sample table values are included with each function

  COREQUISITE SKILLS

Learning Objectives

           Find the domain and range of a function (IA 3.5.1)
A relation is any set of ordered pairs, (x,y). A special type of relation, called a function, is studied extensively in
mathematics. A function is a relation that assigns to each element in its domain exactly one element in the range. For
each ordered pair in the relation, each x-value is matched with only one y-value.
When studying functions, it's important to be able to identify potential input values, called the domain, and potential
output values, called the range.

  EXAMPLE 1
Find the domain of the following function: {(2, 10),(3, 10),(4, 20),(5, 30),(6, 40)}.

     Solution
First identify the input values. The input value is the first coordinate in an ordered pair. There are no restrictions, as the
ordered pairs are simply listed. The domain is the set of the first coordinates of the ordered pairs.
D: {2,3,4,5,6}
Notice here we are using set notation to represent this collection of input values.

A graph of a function can always help in identifying domain and range. When graphing basic functions, we can scan the
x-axis just as we read in English from left to right to help determine the domain. We will scan the y-axis from bottom to
top to help determine the range. So, in finding both domain and range, we scan axes from smallest to largest to see
which values are defined. Typically, we will use interval notation, where you show the endpoints of defined sets using
parentheses (endpoint not included) or brackets (endpoint is included) to express both the domain, D, and range, R, of a
relation or function.

  EXAMPLE 2
Find the domain and range from graphs
Find the domain and range of the function f whose graph is shown below.

     Solution
Scanning the x-axis from left to right helps us to see the graph is defined for x-values between -3 to 1, so the domain of
f is (-3,1]. (Note that open points translate to use of parentheses in interval notation, while included points translate to
use of brackets in interval notation.)
238 3 · Functions

       Scanning the y-values from the bottom to top of the graph helps us to see the graph is defined for y-values between 0
       to -4, so the range is [-4,0).

When working with functions expressed as an equation, the following steps can help to identify the domain.

             ...

                 HOW TO

  Given a function written in equation form, find the domain.
  Step 1. Identify the input values.
  Step 2. Identify any restrictions on the input and exclude those values from the domain.
  Step 3. Write the domain in interval notation form, if possible.

  EXAMPLE 3

Find the domain and range from equations
Find the domain of the function

     Solution
The input value, shown by the variable x in the equation, is squared and then the result is lowered by three. Any real
number may be squared and then be lowered by three, so there are no restrictions on the domain of this function. The
domain is the set of real numbers.

In interval notation form, the domain of f is (-,).

 2. ________________________________________________________________________________
 3. Keeping these trouble spots in mind, algebraically determine the domain of each function. Write each answer in

      interval notation below the function. Remember, looking at the graph of the function can always help in finding
      domain and range.

       Horror and thriller movies are both popular and, very often, extremely profitable. When big-budget actors, shooting
       locations, and special effects are included, however, studios count on even more viewership to be successful. Consider
       five major thriller/horror entries from the early 2000s--I am Legend, Hannibal, The Ring, The Grudge, and The Conjuring.
       Figure 1 shows the amount, in dollars, each of those movies grossed when they were released as well as the ticket sales
       for horror movies in general by year. Notice that we can use the data to create a function of the amount each movie
       earned or the total ticket sales for all horror movies by year. In creating various functions using the data, we can identify
       different independent and dependent variables, and we can analyze the data and the functions to determine the domain
       and range. In this section, we will investigate methods for determining the domain and range of functions such as these.

                                                Figure 1 Based on data compiled by www.the-numbers.com.3

     Finding the Domain of a Function Defined by an Equation

       In Functions and Function Notation, we were introduced to the concepts of domain and range. In this section, we will
       practice determining domains and ranges for specific functions. Keep in mind that, in determining domains and ranges,
       we need to consider what is physically possible or meaningful in real-world examples, such as tickets sales and year in
       the horror movie example above. We also need to consider what is mathematically permitted. For example, we cannot
       include any input value that leads us to take an even root of a negative number if the domain and range consist of real
       numbers. Or in a function expressed as a formula, we cannot include any input value in the domain that would lead us to
       divide by 0.
       We can visualize the domain as a "holding area" that contains "raw materials" for a "function machine" and the range
       as another "holding area" for the machine's products. See Figure 2.

                                                                                     Figure 2
       We can write the domain and range in interval notation, which uses values within brackets to describe a set of
       numbers. In interval notation, we use a square bracket [ when the set includes the endpoint and a parenthesis ( to

indicate that the endpoint is either not included or the interval is unbounded. For example, if a person has $100 to

spend, they would need to express the interval that is more than 0 and less than or equal to 100 and write            We

will discuss interval notation in greater detail later.

Let's turn our attention to finding the domain of a function whose equation is provided. Oftentimes, finding the domain
of such functions involves remembering three different forms. First, if the function has no denominator or an odd root,
consider whether the domain could be all real numbers. Second, if there is a denominator in the function's equation,
exclude values in the domain that force the denominator to be zero. Third, if there is an even root, consider excluding
values that would make the radicand negative.

Before we begin, let us review the conventions of interval notation:

· The smallest number from the interval is written first.
· The largest number in the interval is written second, following a comma.
· Parentheses, ( or ), are used to signify that an endpoint value is not included, called exclusive.

When there is a denominator, we want to include only values of the input that do not force the denominator to be zero.

TRY IT #4 Find the domain of the function

Q&A                Can there be functions in which the domain and range do not intersect at all?

                   Yes. For example, the function  has the set of all positive real numbers as its domain but the

                   set of all negative real numbers as its range. As a more extreme example, a function's inputs and outputs
                   can be completely different categories (for example, names of weekdays as inputs and numbers as
                   outputs, as on an attendance chart), in such cases the domain and range have no elements in common.

Using Notations to Specify Domain and Range

In the previous examples, we used inequalities and lists to describe the domain of functions. We can also use

inequalities, or other statements that might define sets of values or data, to describe the behavior of the variable in set-

builder notation. For example,                     describes the behavior of in set-builder notation. The braces are

read as "the set of," and the vertical bar | is read as "such that," so we would read             as "the set of

x-values such that 10 is less than or equal to and is less than 30."

Figure 5 compares inequality notation, set-builder notation, and interval notation.

                                                   Figure 5

To combine two intervals using inequality notation or set-builder notation, we use the word "or." As we saw in earlier

examples, we use the union symbol, to combine two unconnected intervals. For example, the union of the sets

and                is the set    It is the set of all elements that belong to one or the other (or both) of the

original two sets. For sets with a finite number of elements like these, the elements do not have to be listed in ascending

order of numerical value. If the original two sets have some elements in common, those elements should be listed only

once in the union set. For sets of real numbers on intervals, another example of a union is

Set-Builder Notation and Interval Notation

Set-builder notation is a method of specifying a set of elements that satisfy a certain condition. It takes the form
                                 which is read as, "the set of all such that the statement about is true." For example,

Interval notation is a way of describing sets that include all real numbers between a lower limit that may or may not
be included and an upper limit that may or may not be included. The endpoint values are listed between brackets or
parentheses. A square bracket indicates inclusion in the set, and a parenthesis indicates exclusion from the set. For
example,

           ...

              HOW TO

Given a line graph, describe the set of values using interval notation.

 1. Identify the intervals to be included in the set by determining where the heavy line overlays the real line.
 2. At the left end of each interval, use [ with each end value to be included in the set (solid dot) or ( for each

      excluded end value (open dot).
 3. At the right end of each interval, use ] with each end value to be included in the set (filled dot) or ) for each

      excluded end value (open dot).
 4. Use the union symbol to combine all intervals into one set.

     Finding Domain and Range from Graphs

       Another way to identify the domain and range of functions is by using graphs. Because the domain refers to the set of
       possible input values, the domain of a graph consists of all the input values shown on the x-axis. The range is the set of
       possible output values, which are shown on the y-axis. Keep in mind that if the graph continues beyond the portion of
       the graph we can see, the domain and range may be greater than the visible values. See Figure 8.

We can observe that the graph extends horizontally from to the right without bound, so the domain is   The

vertical extent of the graph is all range values and below, so the range is   Note that the domain and range are

Solution

The input quantity along the horizontal axis is "years," which we represent with the variable for time. The output

quantity is "thousands of barrels of oil per day," which we represent with the variable for barrels. The graph may

continue to the left and right beyond what is viewed, but based on the portion of the graph that is visible, we can

determine the domain as  and the range as approximately

In interval notation, the domain is [1973, 2008], and the range is about [180, 2010]. For the domain and the range, we
approximate the smallest and largest values since they do not fall exactly on the grid lines.

       We will now return to our set of toolkit functions to determine the domain and range of each.

graph is the whole real number line. Because the graph does not include any negative values for the range, the range is
only nonnegative real numbers.

Figure 17 For the cubic function        the domain is all real numbers because the horizontal extent of the graph

is the whole real number line. The same applies to the vertical extent of the graph, so the domain and range include all

real numbers.

Figure 18 For the reciprocal function          we cannot divide by 0, so we must exclude 0 from the domain.

Further, 1 divided by any value can never be 0, so the range also will not include 0. In set-builder notation, we could also

write          the set of all real numbers that are not zero.

Figure 19 For the reciprocal squared function  we cannot divide by so we must exclude from the

domain. There is also no that can give an output of 0, so 0 is excluded from the range as well. Note that the output of
this function is always positive due to the square in the denominator, so the range includes only positive numbers.

Figure 20 For the square root function         we cannot take the square root of a negative real number, so the

domain must be 0 or greater. The range also excludes negative numbers because the square root of a positive number

Graphing Piecewise-Defined Functions

Sometimes, we come across a function that requires more than one formula in order to obtain the given output. For

example, in the toolkit functions, we introduced the absolute value function      With a domain of all real

numbers and a range of values greater than or equal to 0, absolute value can be defined as the magnitude, or modulus,

of a real number value regardless of sign. It is the distance from 0 on the number line. All of these definitions require the

output to be greater than or equal to 0.

If we input 0, or a positive value, the output is the same as the input.

If we input a negative value, the output is the opposite of the input.

Because this requires two different processes or pieces, the absolute value function is an example of a piecewise
function. A piecewise function is a function in which more than one formula is used to define the output over different
pieces of the domain.

We use piecewise functions to describe situations in which a rule or relationship changes as the input value crosses

certain "boundaries." For example, we often encounter situations in business for which the cost per piece of a certain

item is discounted once the number ordered exceeds a certain value. Tax brackets are another real-world example of

piecewise functions. For example, consider a simple tax system in which incomes up to $10,000 are taxed at 10%, and

any additional income is taxed at 20%. The tax on a total income would be     if  and

                    if

own domain, and the domain of the function is the union of all these smaller domains. We notate this idea like this:

open circles to indicate where the endpoint is not included because of a less-than or greater-than inequality; we draw a

Objective 1: Find the slope of a line (IA 3.2.1)

In our work with functions we will make observations about when the function increases or decreases and how quickly
this change takes place. The average rate of change is a measure of change of a function and tells us how an output
quantity, or y value, changes relative to an input quantity, or x value. Finding the average rate of change between two
points is equivalent to finding the slope of the line segment connecting these two data points.

When interpreting an average rate of change it will be important to consider the units of measurement. Make sure to
always attach these units to both the numerator and denominator when they are provided to you.

Gasoline costs have experienced some wild fluctuations over the last several decades. Table 15 lists the average cost, in
dollars, of a gallon of gasoline for the years 2005-2012. The cost of gasoline can be considered as a function of year.

                                  Table 1
If we were interested only in how the gasoline prices changed between 2005 and 2012, we could compute that the cost
per gallon had increased from $2.31 to $3.68, an increase of $1.37. While this is interesting, it might be more useful to
look at how much the price changed per year. In this section, we will investigate changes such as these.

Finding the Average Rate of Change of a Function

The price change per year is a rate of change because it describes how an output quantity changes relative to the
change in the input quantity. We can see that the price of gasoline in Table 1 did not change by the same amount each
year, so the rate of change was not constant. If we use only the beginning and ending data, we would be finding the
average rate of change over the specified period of time. To find the average rate of change, we divide the change in
the output value by the change in the input value.

The Greek letter (delta) signifies the change in a quantity; we read the ratio as "delta-y over delta-x" or "the change in
  divided by the change in " Occasionally we write instead of which still represents the change in the function's

output value resulting from a change to its input value. It does not mean we are changing the function into some other
function.

         Rate of Change
         A rate of change describes how an output quantity changes relative to the change in the input quantity. The units on
         a rate of change are "output units per input units."
         The average rate of change between two input values is the total change of the function values (output values)

speed is 63 miles per hour.

Using a Graph to Determine Where a Function is Increasing, Decreasing, or
Constant

As part of exploring how functions change, we can identify intervals over which the function is changing in specific ways.
We say that a function is increasing on an interval if the function values increase as the input values increase within that
interval. Similarly, a function is decreasing on an interval if the function values decrease as the input values increase over
that interval. The average rate of change of an increasing function is positive, and the average rate of change of a
decreasing function is negative. Figure 3 shows examples of increasing and decreasing intervals on a function.
266 3 · Functions

Figure 3 The function  is increasing on    and is decreasing on

While some functions are increasing (or decreasing) over their entire domain, many others are not. A value of the input
where a function changes from increasing to decreasing (as we go from left to right, that is, as the input variable
increases) is the location of a local maximum. The function value at that point is the local maximum. If a function has
more than one, we say it has local maxima. Similarly, a value of the input where a function changes from decreasing to
increasing as the input variable increases is the location of a local minimum. The function value at that point is the local
minimum. The plural form is "local minima." Together, local maxima and minima are called local extrema, or local
extreme values, of the function. (The singular form is "extremum.") Often, the term local is replaced by the term relative.
In this text, we will use the term local.

Clearly, a function is neither increasing nor decreasing on an interval where it is constant. A function is also neither
increasing nor decreasing at extrema. Note that we have to speak of local extrema, because any given local extremum as
defined here is not necessarily the highest maximum or lowest minimum in the function's entire domain.

For the function whose graph is shown in Figure 4, the local maximum is 16, and it occurs at  The local minimum
is and it occurs at

                                                                              Figure 4
To locate the local maxima and minima from a graph, we need to observe the graph to determine where the graph
attains its highest and lowest points, respectively, within an open interval. Like the summit of a roller coaster, the graph
of a function is higher at a local maximum than at nearby points on both sides. The graph will also be lower at a local
minimum than at neighboring points. Figure 5 illustrates these ideas for a local maximum.

These observations lead us to a formal definition of local extrema.

Local Minima and Local Maxima

A function is an increasing function on an open interval if           for any two input values and in the
given interval where

A function is a decreasing function on an open interval if            for any two input values and in the given
interval where

A function has a local maximum at        if there exists an interval  with                       such that, for any in the

  EXAMPLE 7

Finding Increasing and Decreasing Intervals on a Graph
Given the function in Figure 6, identify the intervals on which the function appears to be increasing.

                                                Figure 6

Solution

We see that the function is not constant on any interval. The function is increasing where it slants upward as we move to

the right and decreasing where it slants downward as we move to the right. The function appears to be increasing from

to        and from  on.

In interval notation, we would say the function appears to be increasing on the interval (1,3) and the interval 

Analysis

Notice in this example that we used open intervals (intervals that do not include the endpoints), because the function is

neither increasing nor decreasing at  ,  , and  . These points are the local extrema (two minima and a

maximum).

EXAMPLE 8

Finding Local Extrema from a Graph

Graph the function                    Then use the graph to estimate the local extrema of the function and to determine

the intervals on which the function is increasing.

Solution

Using technology, we find that the graph of the function looks like that in Figure 7. It appears there is a low point, or

local minimum, between           and    and a mirror-image high point, or local maximum, somewhere between

and

     Analysis
Most graphing calculators and graphing utilities can estimate the location of maxima and minima. Figure 8 provides
screen images from two different technologies, showing the estimate for the local maximum and minimum.

                                                    Figure 8

Based on these estimates, the function is increasing on the interval             and   Notice that, while we

expect the extrema to be symmetric, the two different technologies agree only up to four decimals due to the differing

approximation algorithms used by each. (The exact location of the extrema is at       but determining this requires

calculus.)

     Use A Graph to Locate the Absolute Maximum and Absolute Minimum

       There is a difference between locating the highest and lowest points on a graph in a region around an open interval
       (locally) and locating the highest and lowest points on the graph for the entire domain. The coordinates (output) at
       the highest and lowest points are called the absolute maximum and absolute minimum, respectively.
       To locate absolute maxima and minima from a graph, we need to observe the graph to determine where the graph

A composite function is a two-step function and can have numerical or variable inputs.

                     is read as "f of g of x"

To evaluate a composite function, we always start evaluating the inner function and then evaluate the outer function in
terms of the inner function.

Let's use a table to help us organize our work in evaluating a two-step (composition) function in terms of some
numerical inputs.

First evaluate g in terms of x, the f in terms of g(x).

Suppose we want to calculate how much it costs to heat a house on a particular day of the year. The cost to heat a house
will depend on the average daily temperature, and in turn, the average daily temperature depends on the particular day
of the year. Notice how we have just defined two relationships: The cost depends on the temperature, and the
temperature depends on the day.

Using descriptive variables, we can notate these two functions. The function  gives the cost of heating a house

for a given average daily temperature in degrees Celsius. The function        gives the average daily temperature on

day of the year. For any given day,                means that the cost depends on the temperature, which in turns

depends on the day of the year. Thus, we can evaluate the cost function at the temperature  For example, we could

evaluate  to determine the average daily temperature on the 5th day of the year. Then, we could evaluate the cost

function at that temperature. We would write

By combining these two relationships into one function, we have performed function composition, which is the focus of
this section.

Combining Functions Using Algebraic Operations

Function composition is only one way to combine existing functions. Another way is to carry out the usual algebraic
operations on functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We do this by performing the
operations with the function outputs, defining the result as the output of our new function.

Suppose we need to add two columns of numbers that represent a husband and wife's separate annual incomes over a

period of years, with the result being their total household income. We want to do this for every year, adding only that

year's incomes and then collecting all the data in a new column. If    is the wife's income and is the husband's

income in year and we want to represent the total income, then we can define a new function.
280 3 · Functions

If this holds true for every year, then we can focus on the relation between the functions without reference to a year and
write

Just as for this sum of two functions, we can define difference, product, and ratio functions for any pair of functions that
have the same kinds of inputs (not necessarily numbers) and also the same kinds of outputs (which do have to be
numbers so that the usual operations of algebra can apply to them, and which also must have the same units or no units
when we add and subtract). In this way, we can think of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing functions.

For two functions  and           with real number outputs, we define new functions  and by the

relations

Create a Function by Composition of Functions

Performing algebraic operations on functions combines them into a new function, but we can also create functions by
composing functions. When we wanted to compute a heating cost from a day of the year, we created a new function that
takes a day as input and yields a cost as output. The process of combining functions so that the output of one function
becomes the input of another is known as a composition of functions. The resulting function is known as a composite

function. We represent this combination by the following notation:

We read the left-hand side as composed with at and the right-hand side as of of The two sides of the
equation have the same mathematical meaning and are equal. The open circle symbol is called the composition
operator. We use this operator mainly when we wish to emphasize the relationship between the functions themselves
without referring to any particular input value. Composition is a binary operation that takes two functions and forms a
new function, much as addition or multiplication takes two numbers and gives a new number. However, it is important
not to confuse function composition with multiplication because, as we learned above, in most cases

It is also important to understand the order of operations in evaluating a composite function. We follow the usual

convention with parentheses by starting with the innermost parentheses first, and then working to the outside. In the

equation above, the function takes the input first and yields an output       Then the function takes  as an

input and yields an output

In general,      and  are different functions. In other words, in many cases    for all We will also

see that sometimes two functions can be composed only in one specific order.

For example, if             and       then

but

These expressions are not equal for all values of so the two functions are not equal. It is irrelevant that the
expressions happen to be equal for the single input value

Note that the range of the inside function (the first function to be evaluated) needs to be within the domain of the
outside function. Less formally, the composition has to make sense in terms of inputs and outputs.

  Composition of Functions

  When the output of one function is used as the input of another, we call the entire operation a composition of
  functions. For any input and functions and this action defines a composite function, which we write as
  such that

The domain of the composite function  is all such that is in the domain of and  is in the domain of

The function       is a function whose output is the number of gallons used corresponding to the number of miles

The expression takes miles as the input and a number of gallons as the output. The function      requires a

number of hours as the input. Trying to input a number of gallons does not make sense. The expression        is

meaningless.

The expression       takes hours as input and a number of miles driven as the output. The function requires a

number of miles as the input. Using    (miles driven) as an input value for   where gallons of gas depends on

miles driven, does make sense. The expression      makes sense, and will yield the number of gallons of gas used,

Evaluating Composite Functions

Once we compose a new function from two existing functions, we need to be able to evaluate it for any input in its
domain. We will do this with specific numerical inputs for functions expressed as tables, graphs, and formulas and with
variables as inputs to functions expressed as formulas. In each case, we evaluate the inner function using the starting
input and then use the inner function's output as the input for the outer function.

Evaluating Composite Functions Using Tables

When working with functions given as tables, we read input and output values from the table entries and always work
from the inside to the outside. We evaluate the inside function first and then use the output of the inside function as the
input to the outside function.

Evaluating Composite Functions Using Formulas

When evaluating a composite function where we have either created or been given formulas, the rule of working from
the inside out remains the same. The input value to the outer function will be the output of the inner function, which
may be a numerical value, a variable name, or a more complicated expression.

While we can compose the functions for each individual input value, it is sometimes helpful to find a single formula that

will calculate the result of a composition  To do this, we will extend our idea of function evaluation. Recall that,

Objective 2: Graph quadratic functions using transformations (IA 9.7.4)

When we modify basic functions by adding, subtracting, or multiplying constants to the equation, very systematic
changes take place. We call these transformations of basic functions. Here we will investigate the effects of vertical
shifts, horizontal shifts, vertical stretches or compressions, and reflections on quadratic functions. We could use any
basic function to illustrate transformations, but quadratics work nicely because we can easily keep track of a point called
the vertex.

We all know that a flat mirror enables us to see an accurate image of ourselves and whatever is behind us. When we tilt
the mirror, the images we see may shift horizontally or vertically. But what happens when we bend a flexible mirror? Like
a carnival funhouse mirror, it presents us with a distorted image of ourselves, stretched or compressed horizontally or
vertically. In a similar way, we can distort or transform mathematical functions to better adapt them to describing
objects or processes in the real world. In this section, we will take a look at several kinds of transformations.

Graphing Functions Using Vertical and Horizontal Shifts

Often when given a problem, we try to model the scenario using mathematics in the form of words, tables, graphs, and
equations. One method we can employ is to adapt the basic graphs of the toolkit functions to build new models for a
given scenario. There are systematic ways to alter functions to construct appropriate models for the problems we are
trying to solve.

Identifying Vertical Shifts

One simple kind of transformation involves shifting the entire graph of a function up, down, right, or left. The simplest

shift is a vertical shift, moving the graph up or down, because this transformation involves adding a positive or negative

constant to the function. In other words, we add the same constant to the output value of the function regardless of the

input. For a function         the function         is shifted vertically units. See Figure 2 for an example.

                       Figure 2 Vertical shift by  of the cube root function

To help you visualize the concept of a vertical shift, consider that  Therefore,  is equivalent to

Every unit of is replaced by  so the y-value increases or decreases depending on the value of The result is a

shift upward or downward.

Vertical Shift

Given a function       a new function                       where is a constant, is a vertical shift of the function
                                           is positive, the graph will shift up. If is negative, the graph will shift

Adding a Constant to a Function
To regulate temperature in a green building, airflow vents near the roof open and close throughout the day. Figure 3
shows the area of open vents (in square feet) throughout the day in hours after midnight, During the summer, the
facilities manager decides to try to better regulate temperature by increasing the amount of open vents by 20 square
feet throughout the day and night. Sketch a graph of this new function.

                                                                              Figure 3
     Solution
We can sketch a graph of this new function by adding 20 to each of the output values of the original function. This will
have the effect of shifting the graph vertically up, as shown in Figure 4.

Notice that in Figure 4, for each input value, the output value has increased by 20, so if we call the new function   we

could write

This notation tells us that, for any value of  can be found by evaluating the function at the same input and then

adding 20 to the result. This defines as a transformation of the function in this case a vertical shift up 20 units.

Notice that, with a vertical shift, the input values stay the same and only the output values change. See Table 1.

Identifying Horizontal Shifts

We just saw that the vertical shift is a change to the output, or outside, of the function. We will now look at how changes
to input, on the inside of the function, change its graph and meaning. A shift to the input results in a movement of the
graph of the function left or right in what is known as a horizontal shift, shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Horizontal shift of the function           Note that  means                 , which shifts the graph to the left,
that is, towards negative values of

For example, if                  then      is a new function. Each input is reduced by 2 prior to squaring the

function. The result is that the graph is shifted 2 units to the right, because we would need to increase the prior input by

2 units to yield the same output value as given in

Horizontal Shift

Given a function a new function                     where is a constant, is a horizontal shift of the function If

is positive, the graph will shift right. If is negative, the graph will shift left.

In the new graph, at each time, the airflow is the same as the original function was 2 hours later. For example, in the

original function the airflow starts to change at 8 a.m., whereas for the function the airflow starts to change at 6

a.m. The comparable function values are        See Figure 6. Notice also that the vents first opened to               at

10 a.m. under the original plan, while under the new plan the vents reach    at

8 a.m., so

In both cases, we see that, because      starts 2 hours sooner,   That means that the same output values are

value is 3 less than the original value. For example, we know that       To get the same output from the function

we will need an input value that is 3 larger. We input a value that is 3 larger for  because the function takes 3 away

to 5, 4 shifted to 7, 6 shifted to 9, and 8 shifted to 11.

                   shifted and by how many units?

Combining Vertical and Horizontal Shifts

Now that we have two transformations, we can combine them. Vertical shifts are outside changes that affect the output
(y-) values and shift the function up or down. Horizontal shifts are inside changes that affect the input (x-) values and
shift the function left or right. Combining the two types of shifts will cause the graph of a function to shift up or down
and left or right.

             ...

                 HOW TO

  Given a function and both a vertical and a horizontal shift, sketch the graph.

   1. Identify the vertical and horizontal shifts from the formula.
   2. The vertical shift results from a constant added to the output. Move the graph up for a positive constant and

        down for a negative constant.
   3. The horizontal shift results from a constant added to the input. Move the graph left for a positive constant and

        right for a negative constant.
   4. Apply the shifts to the graph in either order.

We can sketch a graph by applying these transformations one at a time to the original function. Let us follow two points

 1. First, we apply a horizontal reflection: (0, 1) (-1, 2).
 2. Then, we apply a vertical reflection: (0, -1) (-1, -2)
 3. Finally, we apply a vertical shift: (0, 0) (-1, -1)).

This means that the original points, (0,1) and (1,2) become (0,0) and (-1,-1) after we apply the transformations.

Determining Even and Odd Functions

Some functions exhibit symmetry so that reflections result in the original graph. For example, horizontally reflecting the

toolkit functions       or  will result in the original graph. We say that these types of graphs are

symmetric about the y-axis. A function whose graph is symmetric about the y-axis is called an even function.

If the graphs of        or  were reflected over both axes, the result would be the original graph, as shown
in Figure 17.

reflections reproduce the original cubic function.

We say that these graphs are symmetric about the origin. A function with a graph that is symmetric about the origin is
called an odd function.

Note: A function can be neither even nor odd if it does not exhibit either symmetry. For example,  is neither
even nor odd. Also, the only function that is both even and odd is the constant function

Even and Odd Functions

Without looking at a graph, we can determine whether the function is even or odd by finding formulas for the reflections
and determining if they return us to the original function. Let's begin with the rule for even functions.

This does not return us to the original function, so this function is not even. We can now test the rule for odd functions.

Graphing Functions Using Stretches and Compressions

Adding a constant to the inputs or outputs of a function changed the position of a graph with respect to the axes, but it
did not affect the shape of a graph. We now explore the effects of multiplying the inputs or outputs by some quantity.

We can transform the inside (input values) of a function or we can transform the outside (output values) of a function.
Each change has a specific effect that can be seen graphically.

Vertical Stretches and Compressions

When we multiply a function by a positive constant, we get a function whose graph is stretched or compressed vertically
in relation to the graph of the original function. If the constant is greater than 1, we get a vertical stretch; if the
constant is between 0 and 1, we get a vertical compression. Figure 19 shows a function multiplied by constant factors 2

Finding a Horizontal Stretch for a Tabular Function

A function   is given as Table 13. Create a table for the function

                                 Table 13

Solution

The formula                      tells us that the output values for are the same as the output values for the function at

an input half the size. Notice that we do not have enough information to determine because

             and we do not have a value for          in our table. Our input values to will need to be twice as

large to get inputs for that we can evaluate. For example, we can determine

We do the same for the other values to produce Table 14.

Because each input value has been doubled, the result is that the function

EXAMPLE 18

Recognizing a Horizontal Compression on a Graph

Relate the function   to  in Figure 26.

                                                 Figure 26

Solution

The graph of          looks like the graph of  horizontally compressed. Because          ends at  and   ends at

we can see that the values have been compressed by because                               We might also notice that

                 and      Either way, we can describe this relationship as                        This is a horizontal
compression by

Analysis

Notice that the coefficient needed for a horizontal stretch or compression is the reciprocal of the stretch or compression.

So to stretch the graph horizontally by a scale factor of 4, we need a coefficient of in our function:  This means

that the input values must be four times larger to produce the same result, requiring the input to be larger, causing the
horizontal stretching.
324 3 · Functions

TRY IT #11 Write a formula for the toolkit square root function horizontally stretched by a factor of 3.

Performing a Sequence of Transformations

When combining transformations, it is very important to consider the order of the transformations. For example,
vertically shifting by 3 and then vertically stretching by 2 does not create the same graph as vertically stretching by 2 and
then vertically shifting by 3, because when we shift first, both the original function and the shift get stretched, while only
the original function gets stretched when we stretch first.

When we see an expression such as  which transformation should we start with? The answer here follows

nicely from the order of operations. Given the output value of  we first multiply by 2, causing the vertical stretch,

and then add 3, causing the vertical shift. In other words, multiplication before addition.

Horizontal transformations are a little trickier to think about. When we write               for example, we have to

think about how the inputs to the function relate to the inputs to the function Suppose we know             What

input to would produce that output? In other words, what value of will allow                     We would need

                   To solve for we would first subtract 3, resulting in a horizontal shift, and then divide by 2, causing a

horizontal compression.

This format ends up being very difficult to work with, because it is usually much easier to horizontally stretch a graph
before shifting. We can work around this by factoring inside the function.

Let's work through an example.

We can factor out a 2.

Now we can more clearly observe a horizontal shift to the left 2 units and a horizontal compression. Factoring in this way
allows us to horizontally stretch first and then shift horizontally.

Combining Transformations

When combining vertical transformations written in the form     first vertically stretch by and then vertically
shift by

When combining horizontal transformations written in the form                   first horizontally shift by and then
horizontally stretch by

When combining horizontal transformations written in the form                   first horizontally stretch by and then
horizontally shift by

Horizontal and vertical transformations are independent. It does not matter whether horizontal or vertical
transformations are performed first.

Solution

There are three steps to this transformation, and we will work from the inside out. Starting with the horizontal

transformations,  is a horizontal compression by which means we multiply each value by See Table 16.

Looking now to the vertical transformations, we start with the vertical stretch, which will multiply the output values by 2.
We apply this to the previous transformation. See Table 17.

                                                                                2468

Finally, we can apply the vertical shift, which will add 1 to all the output values. See Table 18.

     Solution
To simplify, let's start by factoring out the inside of the function.
326 3 · Functions

       By factoring the inside, we can first horizontally stretch by 2, as indicated by the on the inside of the function.
       Remember that twice the size of 0 is still 0, so the point (0,2) remains at (0,2) while the point (2,0) will stretch to (4,0). See

Objective 1: Solve absolute value equations (IA 2.7.1)

Recall that in its basic form, ()=||, the absolute value function is one of our toolkit functions. The absolute value
function is often thought of as providing the distance the number is from zero on a number line. Numerically, for
whatever the input value is, the output is the magnitude of this value.

The absolute value function can be defined as a piecewise function

EXAMPLE 1

Solve absolute value equations

 Solve for x: |x|=5

     Solution
Since the absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line. Notice that both 5 and -5 are 5 units
from 0 on the number line.

If |x|=5
x=5, or x=-5

 Solve for x: |2x-5|=3

     Solution
In this case the number represented by 2x-5 is 3 units from zero on the number line. So 2x-5 could either equal 3 or -3.

Until the 1920s, the so-called spiral nebulae were believed to be clouds of dust and gas in our own galaxy, some tens of
thousands of light years away. Then, astronomer Edwin Hubble proved that these objects are galaxies in their own right,
at distances of millions of light years. Today, astronomers can detect galaxies that are billions of light years away.

function. In this section, we will continue our investigation of absolute value functions.

Understanding Absolute Value

Recall that in its basic form    the absolute value function is one of our toolkit functions. The absolute value

function is commonly thought of as providing the distance the number is from zero on a number line. Algebraically, for

whatever the input value is, the output is the value without regard to sign. Knowing this, we can use absolute value

functions to solve some kinds of real-world problems.

Absolute Value Function

The absolute value function can be defined as a piecewise function

EXAMPLE 1

Using Absolute Value to Determine Resistance

Electrical parts, such as resistors and capacitors, come with specified values of their operating parameters: resistance,

capacitance, etc. However, due to imprecision in manufacturing, the actual values of these parameters vary somewhat

from piece to piece, even when they are supposed to be the same. The best that manufacturers can do is to try to

guarantee that the variations will stay within a specified range, often  or

Suppose we have a resistor rated at 680 ohms,  Use the absolute value function to express the range of possible
values of the actual resistance.

     Solution
We can find that 5% of 680 ohms is 34 ohms. The absolute value of the difference between the actual and nominal
resistance should not exceed the stated variability, so, with the resistance in ohms,

                   absolute value notation.

Graphing an Absolute Value Function

The most significant feature of the absolute value graph is the corner point at which the graph changes direction. This
point is shown at the origin in Figure 2.

                                                       Figure 2

Figure 3 shows the graph of  The graph of  has been shifted right 3 units, vertically stretched by a

factor of 2, and shifted up 4 units. This means that the corner point is located at     for this transformed function.

                                                                              Figure 3

Writing an Equation for an Absolute Value Function Given a Graph

     Solution
The basic absolute value function changes direction at the origin, so this graph has been shifted to the right 3 units and
down 2 units from the basic toolkit function. See Figure 5.

We also notice that the graph appears vertically stretched, because the width of the final graph on a horizontal line is not
equal to 2 times the vertical distance from the corner to this line, as it would be for an unstretched absolute value
function. Instead, the width is equal to 1 times the vertical distance as shown in Figure 6.

                                                         Figure 6

From this information we can write the equation

     Analysis
Note that these equations are algebraically equivalent--the stretch for an absolute value function can be written
interchangeably as a vertical or horizontal stretch or compression. Note also that if the vertical stretch factor is negative,
there is also a reflection about the x-axis.

Q&A                If we couldn't observe the stretch of the function from the graphs, could we algebraically
                   determine it?

                   Yes. If we are unable to determine the stretch based on the width of the graph, we can solve for the
                   stretch factor by putting in a known pair of values for and

    Q&A  Do the graphs of absolute value functions always intersect the vertical axis? The horizontal axis?

         Yes, they always intersect the vertical axis. The graph of an absolute value function will intersect the
         vertical axis when the input is zero.

         No, they do not always intersect the horizontal axis. The graph may or may not intersect the horizontal
         axis, depending on how the graph has been shifted and reflected. It is possible for the absolute value
         function to intersect the horizontal axis at zero, one, or two points (see Figure 7).

Figure 7 (a) The absolute value function does not intersect the horizontal axis. (b) The absolute value function
intersects the horizontal axis at one point. (c) The absolute value function intersects the horizontal axis at two points.

Solving an Absolute Value Equation

In Other Type of Equations, we touched on the concepts of absolute value equations. Now that we understand a little

more about their graphs, we can take another look at these types of equations. Now that we can graph an absolute

value function, we will learn how to solve an absolute value equation. To solve an equation such as              we

notice that the absolute value will be equal to 8 if the quantity inside the absolute value is 8 or -8. This leads to two

different equations we can solve independently.

Knowing how to solve problems involving absolute value functions is useful. For example, we may need to identify
numbers or points on a line that are at a specified distance from a given reference point.

An absolute value equation is an equation in which the unknown variable appears in absolute value bars. For example,

A composite function is a two-step function and can have numerical or variable inputs.

                          is read as "f of g of x".

To evaluate a composite function, we always start by evaluating the inner function and then evaluate the outer function
in terms of the inner function.

Objective 2: Determine whether a function is one-to-one (IA 10.1.2).

In creating a process called a function, f(x), it is often useful to undo this process, or create an inverse to the function,
f-1(x). When finding the inverse, we restrict our work to one-to-one functions, this means that the inverse we find should
also be one-to-one. Remember that the horizontal line test is a great way to check to see if a graph represents a one-to-
one function.

For any one-to-one function f(x), the inverse is a function f-1(x) such that  and                        .

Function: a relation in which each input value yields a unique output value.
Vertical line test: a method of testing whether a graph represents a function by determining whether a vertical line
intersects the graph no more than once.
One-to-one function: a function for which each value of the output is associated with a unique input value.
Horizontal line test: a method of testing whether a function is one-to-one by determining whether any horizontal line
intersects the graph more than once.

     Solution

 Since any vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, the graph is the graph of a function. Since any

horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point, the graph is the graph of a one-to-one function.

 Since any vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point, the graph is the graph of a function. However, a

horizontal line shown on the graph may intersect it in two points. This graph does not represent a one-to-one function.

At first, Betty considers using the formula she has already found to complete the conversions. After all, she knows her
algebra, and can easily solve the equation for after substituting a value for For example, to convert 26 degrees
Celsius, she could write

After considering this option for a moment, however, she realizes that solving the equation for each of the temperatures
will be awfully tedious. She realizes that since evaluation is easier than solving, it would be much more convenient to
have a different formula, one that takes the Celsius temperature and outputs the Fahrenheit temperature.

The formula for which Betty is searching corresponds to the idea of an inverse function, which is a function for which
the input of the original function becomes the output of the inverse function and the output of the original function
becomes the input of the inverse function.

Given a function  we represent its inverse as          read as inverse of The raised          is part of the notation.

It is not an exponent; it does not imply a power of    . In other words,  does not mean       because        is the

Finding Domain and Range of Inverse Functions

The outputs of the function are the inputs to      so the range of    is also the domain of       Likewise, because the
                                                   is the range of
inputs to are the outputs of  the domain of                           We can visualize the situation as in Figure 3.

                              Figure 3 Domain and range of a function and its inverse
350 3 · Functions

When a function has no inverse function, it is possible to create a new function where that new function on a limited

domain does have an inverse function. For example, the inverse of                is  because a square

"undoes" a square root; but the square is only the inverse of the square root on the domain  since that is the

range of

We can look at this problem from the other side, starting with the square (toolkit quadratic) function  If we

want to construct an inverse to this function, we run into a problem, because for every given output of the quadratic

function, there are two corresponding inputs (except when the input is 0). For example, the output 9 from the quadratic

function corresponds to the inputs 3 and -3. But an output from a function is an input to its inverse; if this inverse input

corresponds to more than one inverse output (input of the original function), then the "inverse" is not a function at all!

To put it differently, the quadratic function is not a one-to-one function; it fails the horizontal line test, so it does not have

an inverse function. In order for a function to have an inverse, it must be a one-to-one function.

In many cases, if a function is not one-to-one, we can still restrict the function to a part of its domain on which it is one-

to-one. For example, we can make a restricted version of the square function         with its domain limited to

     which is a one-to-one function (it passes the horizontal line test) and which has an inverse (the square-root

function).

If                 on  then the inverse function is

    · The domain of = range of = 
    · The domain of = range of = 

    Q&A            Is it possible for a function to have more than one inverse?

                   No. If two supposedly different functions, say, and both meet the definition of being inverses of

                   another function then you can prove that  We have just seen that some functions only have

                   inverses if we restrict the domain of the original function. In these cases, there may be more than one way

                   to restrict the domain, leading to different inverses. However, on any one domain, the original function

                   still has only one unique inverse.

    Domain and Range of Inverse Functions

    The range of a function      is the domain of the inverse function

    The domain of  is the range of

               ...

                  HOW TO

    Given a function, find the domain and range of its inverse.

     1. If the function is one-to-one, write the range of the original function as the domain of the inverse, and write the
          domain of the original function as the range of the inverse.

     2. If the domain of the original function needs to be restricted to make it one-to-one, then this restricted domain
          becomes the range of the inverse function.

Finding the Inverses of Toolkit Functions
Identify which of the toolkit functions besides the quadratic function are not one-to-one, and find a restricted domain on

     Solution
The constant function is not one-to-one, and there is no domain (except a single point) on which it could be one-to-one,
so the constant function has no inverse.

We can see that these functions (if unrestricted) are not one-to-one by looking at their graphs, shown in Figure 4. They
both would fail the horizontal line test. However, if a function is restricted to a certain domain so that it passes the
horizontal line test, then in that restricted domain, it can have an inverse.

Finding and Evaluating Inverse Functions

Once we have a one-to-one function, we can evaluate its inverse at specific inverse function inputs or construct a
complete representation of the inverse function in many cases.

Inverting Tabular Functions

Suppose we want to find the inverse of a function represented in table form. Remember that the domain of a function is
the range of the inverse and the range of the function is the domain of the inverse. So we need to interchange the
domain and range.

Each row (or column) of inputs becomes the row (or column) of outputs for the inverse function. Similarly, each row (or
column) of outputs becomes the row (or column) of inputs for the inverse function.

Solution

The inverse function takes an output of and returns an input for So in the expression                        70 is an output value

of the original function, representing 70 miles. The inverse will return the corresponding input of the original function

Evaluating the Inverse of a Function, Given a Graph of the Original Function

We saw in Functions and Function Notation that the domain of a function can be read by observing the horizontal extent
of its graph. We find the domain of the inverse function by observing the vertical extent of the graph of the original
function, because this corresponds to the horizontal extent of the inverse function. Similarly, we find the range of the
inverse function by observing the horizontal extent of the graph of the original function, as this is the vertical extent of
the inverse function. If we want to evaluate an inverse function, we find its input within its domain, which is all or part of
the vertical axis of the original function's graph.

Restricting the domain to  makes the function one-to-one (it will obviously pass the horizontal line test), so it has

an inverse on this restricted domain.

swapping inputs and outputs. This is equivalent to interchanging the roles of the vertical and horizontal axes.

Key Concepts

3.1 Functions and Function Notation

· A relation is a set of ordered pairs. A function is a specific type of relation in which each domain value, or input,

leads to exactly one range value, or output. See Example 1 and Example 2.

· Function notation is a shorthand method for relating the input to the output in the form  See Example 3

and Example 4.

· In tabular form, a function can be represented by rows or columns that relate to input and output values. See

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                          3 · Chapter Review 363

      Example 5.
  · To evaluate a function, we determine an output value for a corresponding input value. Algebraic forms of a function

      can be evaluated by replacing the input variable with a given value. See Example 6 and Example 7.
  · To solve for a specific function value, we determine the input values that yield the specific output value. See

      Example 8.
  · An algebraic form of a function can be written from an equation. See Example 9 and Example 10.
  · Input and output values of a function can be identified from a table. See Example 11.
  · Relating input values to output values on a graph is another way to evaluate a function. See Example 12.
  · A function is one-to-one if each output value corresponds to only one input value. See Example 13.
  · A graph represents a function if any vertical line drawn on the graph intersects the graph at no more than one

      point. See Example 14.
  · The graph of a one-to-one function passes the horizontal line test. See Example 15.

3.2 Domain and Range

  · The domain of a function includes all real input values that would not cause us to attempt an undefined
      mathematical operation, such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.

  · The domain of a function can be determined by listing the input values of a set of ordered pairs. See Example 1.
  · The domain of a function can also be determined by identifying the input values of a function written as an

      equation. See Example 2, Example 3, and Example 4.
  · Interval values represented on a number line can be described using inequality notation, set-builder notation, and

      interval notation. See Example 5.
  · For many functions, the domain and range can be determined from a graph. See Example 6 and Example 7.
  · An understanding of toolkit functions can be used to find the domain and range of related functions. See Example 8,

      Example 9, and Example 10.
  · A piecewise function is described by more than one formula. See Example 11 and Example 12.
  · A piecewise function can be graphed using each algebraic formula on its assigned subdomain. See Example 13.

3.3 Rates of Change and Behavior of Graphs

  · A rate of change relates a change in an output quantity to a change in an input quantity. The average rate of change
      is determined using only the beginning and ending data. See Example 1.

  · Identifying points that mark the interval on a graph can be used to find the average rate of change. See Example 2.
  · Comparing pairs of input and output values in a table can also be used to find the average rate of change. See

      Example 3.
  · An average rate of change can also be computed by determining the function values at the endpoints of an interval

      described by a formula. See Example 4 and Example 5.
  · The average rate of change can sometimes be determined as an expression. See Example 6.
  · A function is increasing where its rate of change is positive and decreasing where its rate of change is negative. See

      Example 7.
  · A local maximum is where a function changes from increasing to decreasing and has an output value larger (more

      positive or less negative) than output values at neighboring input values.
  · A local minimum is where the function changes from decreasing to increasing (as the input increases) and has an

      output value smaller (more negative or less positive) than output values at neighboring input values.
  · Minima and maxima are also called extrema.
  · We can find local extrema from a graph. See Example 8 and Example 9.
  · The highest and lowest points on a graph indicate the maxima and minima. See Example 10.

3.4 Composition of Functions

  · We can perform algebraic operations on functions. See Example 1.
  · When functions are combined, the output of the first (inner) function becomes the input of the second (outer)

      function.
  · The function produced by combining two functions is a composite function. See Example 2 and Example 3.
  · The order of function composition must be considered when interpreting the meaning of composite functions. See

      Example 4.
  · A composite function can be evaluated by evaluating the inner function using the given input value and then

      evaluating the outer function taking as its input the output of the inner function.
  · A composite function can be evaluated from a table. See Example 5.
  · A composite function can be evaluated from a graph. See Example 6.
  · A composite function can be evaluated from a formula. See Example 7.
364 3 · Chapter Review

· The domain of a composite function consists of those inputs in the domain of the inner function that correspond to
    outputs of the inner function that are in the domain of the outer function. See Example 8 and Example 9.

· Just as functions can be combined to form a composite function, composite functions can be decomposed into
    simpler functions.

· Functions can often be decomposed in more than one way. See Example 10.

3.5 Transformation of Functions

· A function can be shifted vertically by adding a constant to the output. See Example 1 and Example 2.
· A function can be shifted horizontally by adding a constant to the input. See Example 3, Example 4, and Example 5.
· Relating the shift to the context of a problem makes it possible to compare and interpret vertical and horizontal

    shifts. See Example 6.
· Vertical and horizontal shifts are often combined. See Example 7 and Example 8.
· A vertical reflection reflects a graph about the axis. A graph can be reflected vertically by multiplying the output

    by -1.
· A horizontal reflection reflects a graph about the axis. A graph can be reflected horizontally by multiplying the

    input by -1.
· A graph can be reflected both vertically and horizontally. The order in which the reflections are applied does not

    affect the final graph. See Example 9.
· A function presented in tabular form can also be reflected by multiplying the values in the input and output rows or

    columns accordingly. See Example 10.
· A function presented as an equation can be reflected by applying transformations one at a time. See Example 11.
· Even functions are symmetric about the axis, whereas odd functions are symmetric about the origin.
· Even functions satisfy the condition
· Odd functions satisfy the condition
· A function can be odd, even, or neither. See Example 12.
· A function can be compressed or stretched vertically by multiplying the output by a constant. See Example 13,

    Example 14, and Example 15.
· A function can be compressed or stretched horizontally by multiplying the input by a constant. See Example 16,

    Example 17, and Example 18.
· The order in which different transformations are applied does affect the final function. Both vertical and horizontal

    transformations must be applied in the order given. However, a vertical transformation may be combined with a
    horizontal transformation in any order. See Example 19 and Example 20.

3.6 Absolute Value Functions

· Applied problems, such as ranges of possible values, can also be solved using the absolute value function. See
    Example 1.

· The graph of the absolute value function resembles a letter V. It has a corner point at which the graph changes
    direction. See Example 2.

· In an absolute value equation, an unknown variable is the input of an absolute value function.
· If the absolute value of an expression is set equal to a positive number, expect two solutions for the unknown

    variable. See Example 3.

3.7 Inverse Functions

· If  is the inverse of          then                   See Example 1, Example 2, and Example 3.

· Only some of the toolkit functions have an inverse. See Example 4.

· For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one (pass the horizontal line test).

· A function that is not one-to-one over its entire domain may be one-to-one on part of its domain.

· For a tabular function, exchange the input and output rows to obtain the inverse. See Example 5.

· The inverse of a function can be determined at specific points on its graph. See Example 6.

· To find the inverse of a formula, solve the equation  for as a function of Then exchange the labels

and See Example 7, Example 8, and Example 9.

· The graph of an inverse function is the reflection of the graph of the original function across the line  See

Example 10.

      Introduction to Linear Functions

Imagine placing a plant in the ground one day and finding that it has doubled its height just a few days later. Although it
may seem incredible, this can happen with certain types of bamboo species. These members of the grass family are the
fastest-growing plants in the world. One species of bamboo has been observed to grow nearly 1.5 inches every hour. 1
In a twenty-four hour period, this bamboo plant grows about 36 inches, or an incredible 3 feet! A constant rate of
change, such as the growth cycle of this bamboo plant, is a linear function.

Recall from Functions and Function Notation that a function is a relation that assigns to every element in the domain
exactly one element in the range. Linear functions are a specific type of function that can be used to model many real-
world applications, such as plant growth over time. In this chapter, we will explore linear functions, their graphs, and
how to relate them to data.

Just as with the growth of a bamboo plant, there are many situations that involve constant change over time. Consider,
for example, the first commercial maglev train in the world, the Shanghai MagLev Train (Figure 1). It carries passengers
comfortably for a 30-kilometer trip from the airport to the subway station in only eight minutes2 .

Suppose a maglev train travels a long distance, and maintains a constant speed of 83 meters per second for a period of
time once it is 250 meters from the station. How can we analyze the train's distance from the station as a function of
time? In this section, we will investigate a kind of function that is useful for this purpose, and use it to investigate real-
world situations such as the train's distance from the station at a given point in time.

Representing Linear Functions

The function describing the train's motion is a linear function, which is defined as a function with a constant rate of
change. This is a polynomial of degree 1. There are several ways to represent a linear function, including word form,
function notation, tabular form, and graphical form. We will describe the train's motion as a function using each method.

Representing a Linear Function in Word Form

Let's begin by describing the linear function in words. For the train problem we just considered, the following word
sentence may be used to describe the function relationship.

  · The train's distance from the station is a function of the time during which the train moves at a constant speed plus
      its original distance from the station when it began moving at constant speed.

The speed is the rate of change. Recall that a rate of change is a measure of how quickly the dependent variable changes
with respect to the independent variable. The rate of change for this example is constant, which means that it is the
same for each input value. As the time (input) increases by 1 second, the corresponding distance (output) increases by
83 meters. The train began moving at this constant speed at a distance of 250 meters from the station.

Representing a Linear Function in Function Notation

Another approach to representing linear functions is by using function notation. One example of function notation is an
equation written in the slope-intercept form of a line, where is the input value, is the rate of change, and is the
initial value of the dependent variable.

In the example of the train, we might use the notation  where the total distance is a function of the time The

rate, is 83 meters per second. The initial value of the dependent variable is the original distance from the station,

250 meters. We can write a generalized equation to represent the motion of the train.

Representing a Linear Function in Tabular Form

A third method of representing a linear function is through the use of a table. The relationship between the distance
from the station and the time is represented in Figure 2. From the table, we can see that the distance changes by 83
meters for every 1 second increase in time.

380 4 · Linear Functions

Q&A          Figure 2 Tabular representation of the function showing selected input and output values
              Can the input in the previous example be any real number?

              No. The input represents time so while nonnegative rational and irrational numbers are possible, negative
              real numbers are not possible for this example. The input consists of non-negative real numbers.

Representing a Linear Function in Graphical Form

Another way to represent linear functions is visually, using a graph. We can use the function relationship from above,
                          to draw a graph as represented in Figure 3. Notice the graph is a line. When we plot a linear function,

the graph is always a line.

The rate of change, which is constant, determines the slant, or slope of the line. The point at which the input value is zero

is the vertical intercept, or y-intercept, of the line. We can see from the graph that the y-intercept in the train example we

just saw is               and represents the distance of the train from the station when it began moving at a constant speed.

Figure 3 The graph of            . Graphs of linear functions are lines because the rate of change is constant.

Notice that the graph of the train example is restricted, but this is not always the case. Consider the graph of the line
                     Ask yourself what numbers can be input to the function. In other words, what is the domain of the

function? The domain is comprised of all real numbers because any number may be doubled, and then have one added
to the product.

Linear Function

A linear function is a function whose graph is a line. Linear functions can be written in the slope-intercept form of a
line

where is the initial or starting value of the function (when input,  ), and is the constant rate of change, or
slope of the function. The y-intercept is at

     Solution
To restate the function in words, we need to describe each part of the equation. The pressure as a function of depth
equals four hundred thirty-four thousandths times depth plus fourteen and six hundred ninety-six thousandths.
     Analysis
The initial value, 14.696, is the pressure in PSI on the diver at a depth of 0 feet, which is the surface of the water. The rate
of change, or slope, is 0.434 PSI per foot. This tells us that the pressure on the diver increases 0.434 PSI for each foot her
depth increases.

Determining Whether a Linear Function Is Increasing, Decreasing, or Constant

The linear functions we used in the two previous examples increased over time, but not every linear function does. A
linear function may be increasing, decreasing, or constant. For an increasing function, as with the train example, the
output values increase as the input values increase. The graph of an increasing function has a positive slope. A line with
a positive slope slants upward from left to right as in Figure 5(a). For a decreasing function, the slope is negative. The
output values decrease as the input values increase. A line with a negative slope slants downward from left to right as in
Figure 5(b). If the function is constant, the output values are the same for all input values so the slope is zero. A line with
a slope of zero is horizontal as in Figure 5(c).

                                                                              Figure 5

communicate.3 . For each of the following scenarios, find the linear function that describes the relationship between the
input value and the output value. Then, determine whether the graph of the function is increasing, decreasing, or
constant.

 The total number of texts a teen sends is considered a function of time in days. The input is the number of days,

and output is the total number of texts sent.

 A person has a limit of 500 texts per month in their data plan. The input is the number of days, and output is the

total number of texts remaining for the month.

 A person has an unlimited number of texts in their data plan for a cost of $50 per month. The input is the number

of days, and output is the total cost of texting each month.
     Solution

Analyze each function.

 The function can be represented as           where is the number of days. The slope, 60, is positive so the

function is increasing. This makes sense because the total number of texts increases with each day.

 The function can be represented as           where is the number of days. In this case, the slope is

negative so the function is decreasing. This makes sense because the number of texts remaining decreases each day

and this function represents the number of texts remaining in the data plan after days.

 The cost function can be represented as      because the number of days does not affect the total cost. The

slope is 0 so the function is constant.

Interpreting Slope as a Rate of Change

In the examples we have seen so far, the slope was provided to us. However, we often need to calculate the slope given

input and output values. Recall that given two values for the input, and and two corresponding values for the

output, and --which can be represented by a set of points,        and  --we can calculate the slope

Note that in function notation we can obtain two corresponding values for the output and for the function

           and            so we could equivalently write

Figure 6 indicates how the slope of the line between the points,  and  is calculated. Recall that the slope

measures steepness, or slant. The greater the absolute value of the slope, the steeper the slant is.

the same coordinate pair.

    Q&A Are the units for slope always

               Yes. Think of the units as the change of output value for each unit of change in input value. An example of
               slope could be miles per hour or dollars per day. Notice the units appear as a ratio of units for the output
               per units for the input.

       as the first output value, or y-coordinate, used corresponds with the first input value, or x-coordinate, used. Note that if
       we had reversed them, we would have obtained the same slope.

  EXAMPLE 4

Finding the Population Change from a Linear Function
The population of a city increased from 23,400 to 27,800 between 2008 and 2012. Find the change of population per year
if we assume the change was constant from 2008 to 2012.

     Solution
The rate of change relates the change in population to the change in time. The population increased by

                                    people over the four-year time interval. To find the rate of change, divide the change in the
number of people by the number of years.

So the population increased by 1,100 people per year.

     Analysis
Because we are told that the population increased, we would expect the slope to be positive. This positive slope we
calculated is therefore reasonable.

Solution

The fixed cost is present every month, $1,250. The costs that can vary include the cost to produce each item, which is

The initial value for this function is 200 because he currently owns 200 songs, so

The number of songs increases by 15 songs per month, so the rate of change is 15 songs per month. Therefore we know

that       We can substitute the initial value and the rate of change into the slope-intercept form of a line.

Using a Linear Function to Calculate Salary Based on Commission

Working as an insurance salesperson, Ilya earns a base salary plus a commission on each new policy. Therefore, Ilya's

and earned $760 for the week. The week before, he sold 5 new policies and earned $920. Find an equation for      and

interpret the meaning of the components of the equation.

Solution

The given information gives us two input-output pairs:       and     We start by finding the rate of change.

Keeping track of units can help us interpret this quantity. Income increased by $160 when the number of policies
increased by 2, so the rate of change is $80 per policy. Therefore, Ilya earns a commission of $80 for each policy sold
during the week.
We can then solve for the initial value.

                                                                   

The value of is the starting value for the function and represents Ilya's income when   or when no new policies

are sold. We can interpret this as Ilya's base salary for the week, which does not depend upon the number of policies

sold.

We can now write the final equation.

Our final interpretation is that Ilya's base salary is $520 per week and he earns an additional $80 commission for each
policy sold.

Graphing Linear Functions

Now that we've seen and interpreted graphs of linear functions, let's take a look at how to create the graphs. There are
three basic methods of graphing linear functions. The first is by plotting points and then drawing a line through the
points. The second is by using the y-intercept and slope. And the third method is by using transformations of the identity
function

Graphing a Function by Plotting Points

To find points of a function, we can choose input values, evaluate the function at these input values, and calculate output

values. The input values and corresponding output values form coordinate pairs. We then plot the coordinate pairs on a

grid. In general, we should evaluate the function at a minimum of two inputs in order to find at least two points on the

graph. For example, given the function,   we might use the input values 1 and 2. Evaluating the function for an

input value of 1 yields an output value of 2, which is represented by the point      Evaluating the function for an input

value of 2 yields an output value of 4, which is represented by the point        Choosing three points is often advisable

because if all three points do not fall on the same line, we know we made an error.

     HOW TO

Given a linear function, graph by plotting points.

 1. Choose a minimum of two input values.
 2. Evaluate the function at each input value.

indicates a negative slope. This is also expected from the negative, constant rate of change in the equation for the
function.

TRY IT #5 Graph                              by plotting points.

Graphing a Function Using y-intercept and Slope

Another way to graph linear functions is by using specific characteristics of the function rather than plotting points. The
first characteristic is its y-intercept, which is the point at which the input value is zero. To find the y-intercept, we can set

        in the equation.

The other characteristic of the linear function is its slope.

Let's consider the following function.

The slope is Because the slope is positive, we know the graph will slant upward from left to right. The y-intercept is

the point on the graph when  The graph crosses the y-axis at                Now we know the slope and the y-intercept.

We can begin graphing by plotting the point  We know that the slope is the change in the y-coordinate over the

change in the x-coordinate. This is commonly referred to as rise over run,         From our example, we have

which means that the rise is 1 and the run is 2. So starting from our y-intercept  we can rise 1 and then run 2, or
392 4 · Linear Functions

       run 2 and then rise 1. We repeat until we have a few points, and then we draw a line through the points as shown in
       Figure 12.

Graphical Interpretation of a Linear Function

In the equation

· is the y-intercept of the graph and indicates the point             at which the graph crosses the y-axis.

· is the slope of the line and indicates the vertical displacement (rise) and horizontal displacement (run)

between each successive pair of points. Recall the formula for the slope:

Q&A         Do all linear functions have y-intercepts?

            Yes. All linear functions cross the y-axis and therefore have y-intercepts. (Note: A vertical line is parallel to
            the y-axis does not have a y-intercept, but it is not a function.)

            HOW TO

 1. Evaluate the function at an input value of zero to find the y-intercept.
 2. Identify the slope as the rate of change of the input value.
 3. Plot the point represented by the y-intercept.
 4. Use to determine at least two more points on the line.
 5. Sketch the line that passes through the points.

units. We can extend the line to the left and right by repeating, and then drawing a line through the points.

Graphing a Function Using Transformations

Another option for graphing is to use a transformation of the identity function  A function may be transformed

by a shift up, down, left, or right. A function may also be transformed using a reflection, stretch, or compression.

Vertical Stretch or Compression

In the equation  the is acting as the vertical stretch or compression of the identity function. When is

negative, there is also a vertical reflection of the graph. Notice in Figure 14 that multiplying the equation of      by

    stretches the graph of by a factor of units if  and compresses the graph of by a factor of units if

    This means the larger the absolute value of the steeper the slope.

Vertical Shift

In               the acts as the vertical shift, moving the graph up and down without affecting the slope of the line.

Notice in Figure 15 that adding a value of to the equation of  shifts the graph of a total of units up if is

positive and units down if is negative.

Q&A  In Example 15, could we have sketched the graph by reversing the order of the transformations?

     No. The order of the transformations follows the order of operations. When the function is evaluated at a
     given input, the corresponding output is calculated by following the order of operations. This is why we

Earlier, we wrote the equation for a linear function from a graph. Now we can extend what we know about graphing

linear functions to analyze graphs a little more closely. Begin by taking a look at Figure 18. We can see right away that

the graph crosses the y-axis at the point  so this is the y-intercept.

                                                                             Figure 18
Then we can calculate the slope by finding the rise and run. We can choose any two points, but let's look at the point

           To get from this point to the y-intercept, we must move up 4 units (rise) and to the right 2 units (run). So the
slope must be

Substituting the slope and y-intercept into the slope-intercept form of a line gives

              HOW TO

Given a graph of linear function, find the equation to describe the function.

 1. Identify the y-intercept of an equation.
 2. Choose two points to determine the slope.
 3. Substitute the y-intercept and slope into the slope-intercept form of a line.

     Solution
Analyze the information for each function.

 This function has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3. It must pass through the point (0, 3) and slant upward from

left to right. We can use two points to find the slope, or we can compare it with the other functions listed. Function

has the same slope, but a different y-intercept. Lines I and III have the same slant because they have the same slope.

Line III does not pass through   so must be represented by line I.

 This function also has a slope of 2, but a y-intercept of      It must pass through the point  and slant

upward from left to right. It must be represented by line III.

 This function has a slope of -2 and a y-intercept of 3. This is the only function listed with a negative slope, so it

must be represented by line IV because it slants downward from left to right.

 This function has a slope of and a y-intercept of 3. It must pass through the point (0, 3) and slant upward from
left to right. Lines I and II pass through         but the slope of is less than the slope of so the line for must be

flatter. This function is represented by Line II.

Now we can re-label the lines as in Figure 20.

Finding the x-intercept of a Line

So far we have been finding the y-intercepts of a function: the point at which the graph of the function crosses the y-axis.
Recall that a function may also have an x-intercept, which is the x-coordinate of the point where the graph of the
function crosses the x-axis. In other words, it is the input value when the output value is zero.

To find the x-intercept, set a function    equal to zero and solve for the value of For example, consider the function
shown.

Set the function equal to 0 and solve for

Q&A Do all linear functions have x-intercepts?

Describing Horizontal and Vertical Lines

There are two special cases of lines on a graph--horizontal and vertical lines. A horizontal line indicates a constant

output, or y-value. In Figure 23, we see that the output has a value of 2 for every input value. The change in outputs

between any two points, therefore, is 0. In the slope formula, the numerator is 0, so the slope is 0. If we use         in the

equation  the equation simplifies to      In other words, the value of the function is a constant. This

graph represents the function

                                        Figure 23 A horizontal line representing the function

A vertical line indicates a constant input, or x-value. We can see that the input value for every point on the line is 2, but
the output value varies. Because this input value is mapped to more than one output value, a vertical line does not
represent a function. Notice that between any two points, the change in the input values is zero. In the slope formula,
the denominator will be zero, so the slope of a vertical line is undefined.

Determining Whether Lines are Parallel or Perpendicular

The two lines in Figure 28 are parallel lines: they will never intersect. They have exactly the same steepness, which means
their slopes are identical. The only difference between the two lines is the y-intercept. If we shifted one line vertically
toward the other, they would become coincident.
402 4 · Linear Functions

                                                                    Figure 28 Parallel lines
We can determine from their equations whether two lines are parallel by comparing their slopes. If the slopes are the
same and the y-intercepts are different, the lines are parallel. If the slopes are different, the lines are not parallel.

Unlike parallel lines, perpendicular lines do intersect. Their intersection forms a right, or 90-degree, angle. The two lines
in Figure 29 are perpendicular.

                                 Figure 29 Perpendicular lines

Perpendicular lines do not have the same slope. The slopes of perpendicular lines are different from one another in a

specific way. The slope of one line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the other line. The product of a number and

its reciprocal is So, if         are negative reciprocals of one another, they can be multiplied together to yield

To find the reciprocal of a number, divide 1 by the number. So the reciprocal of 8 is  and the reciprocal of is 8. To
find the negative reciprocal, first find the reciprocal and then change the sign.

As with parallel lines, we can determine whether two lines are perpendicular by comparing their slopes, assuming that
the lines are neither horizontal nor vertical. The slope of each line below is the negative reciprocal of the other so the
lines are perpendicular.

The product of the slopes is -1.

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Two lines are parallel lines if they do not intersect. The slopes of the lines are the same.

If and only if  and                 we say the lines coincide. Coincident lines are the same line.

Two lines are perpendicular lines if they intersect to form a right angle.

  EXAMPLE 18

Identifying Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Given the functions below, identify the functions whose graphs are a pair of parallel lines and a pair of perpendicular
lines.

Solution

Parallel lines have the same slope. Because the functions    and                              each have a slope of 2, they

represent parallel lines. Perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal slopes. Because -2 and are negative reciprocals,

the functions        and                     represent perpendicular lines.

     Analysis
A graph of the lines is shown in Figure 30.

                                                  Figure 30

The graph shows that the lines               and           are parallel, and the lines              and

                are perpendicular.

If we know the equation of a line, we can use what we know about slope to write the equation of a line that is either

parallel or perpendicular to the given line.

Writing Equations of Parallel Lines

Suppose for example, we are given the equation shown.

We know that the slope of the line formed by the function is 3. We also know that the y-intercept is   Any other line

with a slope of 3 will be parallel to     So the lines formed by all of the following functions will be parallel to

Suppose then we want to write the equation of a line that is parallel to and passes through the point                This type of

problem is often described as a point-slope problem because we have a point and a slope. In our example, we know that

the slope is 3. We need to determine which value of will give the correct line. We can begin with the point-slope form of

an equation for a line, and then rewrite it in the slope-intercept form.

So                        is parallel to       and passes through the point

slope, however, we use the negative reciprocal of the given slope. Suppose we are given the function shown.

The slope of the line is 2, and its negative reciprocal is Any function with a slope of  will be perpendicular to
So the lines formed by all of the following functions will be perpendicular to

As before, we can narrow down our choices for a particular perpendicular line if we know that it passes through a given

point. Suppose then we want to write the equation of a line that is perpendicular to     and passes through the point

    We already know that the slope is Now we can use the point to find the y-intercept by substituting the given

values into the slope-intercept form of a line and solving for

The equation for the function with a slope of and a y-intercept of 2 is

lines may not look obviously perpendicular on a graphing calculator unless we use the square zoom feature.

    Q&A  A horizontal line has a slope of zero and a vertical line has an undefined slope. These two lines are
         perpendicular, but the product of their slopes is not -1. Doesn't this fact contradict the definition of
         perpendicular lines?

         No. For two perpendicular linear functions, the product of their slopes is -1. However, a vertical line is not
         a function so the definition is not contradicted.

Graph and Interpret Applications of Slope-Intercept form of linear equations.
Many real-world applications are modeled by linear functions. We will take a look at a few applications here so you can
see how equations written in slope-intercept form describe real world situations.

Usually, when a linear function uses real-world data, different letters are used to represent the variables, instead of
using only and . The variables used remind us of what quantities are being measured.

Also, we often will need to adjust the axes in our rectangular coordinate system to different scales to accommodate the
data in the application. Since many applications have both independent and dependent variables that are positive our
graphs will lie primarily in Quadrant I.

Linear Functions
A linear function is a function whose graph is a line. Linear functions can be written in the slope-intercept form of a line

where b is the initial or starting value of the function (when input, x=0), and m is the constant rate of change, or slope of
the function. The y-intercept is at (0,b),

                                                    .

When interpreting slope, it will be important to consider the units of measurement. Make sure to always attach these
units to both the numerator and denominator when they are provided to you.

EXAMPLE 1

The equation                     is used to convert temperatures, C, on the Celsius scale to temperatures, F, on the

Interpret the slope and F-intercept of the equation.
Even though this equation uses F and C, it is still in slope-intercept form.

predictions based on those relationships. In this section, we will explore examples of linear function models.

Building Linear Models from Verbal Descriptions

When building linear models to solve problems involving quantities with a constant rate of change, we typically follow
the same problem strategies that we would use for any type of function. Let's briefly review them:

 1. Identify changing quantities, and then define descriptive variables to represent those quantities. When appropriate,
      sketch a picture or define a coordinate system.

 2. Carefully read the problem to identify important information. Look for information that provides values for the
      variables or values for parts of the functional model, such as slope and initial value.

 3. Carefully read the problem to determine what we are trying to find, identify, solve, or interpret.
 4. Identify a solution pathway from the provided information to what we are trying to find. Often this will involve

      checking and tracking units, building a table, or even finding a formula for the function being used to model the
      problem.
 5. When needed, write a formula for the function.
 6. Solve or evaluate the function using the formula.
 7. Reflect on whether your answer is reasonable for the given situation and whether it makes sense mathematically.
 8. Clearly convey your result using appropriate units, and answer in full sentences when necessary.

Now let's take a look at the student in Seattle. In Elan's situation, there are two changing quantities: time and money.
The amount of money they have remaining while on vacation depends on how long they stay. We can use this
information to define our variables, including units.

So, the amount of money remaining depends on the number of weeks:      .

Notice that the unit of dollars per week matches the unit of our output variable divided by our input variable. Also,
because the slope is negative, the linear function is decreasing. This should make sense because she is spending money
each week.

The rate of change is constant, so we can start with the linear model     Then we can substitute the
intercept and slope provided.

To find the t-intercept (horizontal axis intercept), we set the output to zero, and solve for the input.

The t-intercept (horizontal axis intercept) is 8.75 weeks. Because this represents the input value when the output will be
zero, we could say that Elan will have no money left after 8.75 weeks.
When modeling any real-life scenario with functions, there is typically a limited domain over which that model will be
valid--almost no trend continues indefinitely. Here the domain refers to the number of weeks. In this case, it doesn't
make sense to talk about input values less than zero. A negative input value could refer to a number of weeks before
Elan saved $3,500, but the scenario discussed poses the question once they saved $3,500 because this is when the trip
and subsequent spending starts. It is also likely that this model is not valid after the t-intercept (horizontal axis
intercept), unless Elan uses a credit card and goes into debt. The domain represents the set of input values, so the
reasonable domain for this function is
In this example, we were given a written description of the situation. We followed the steps of modeling a problem to
420 4 · Linear Functions

       analyze the information. However, the information provided may not always be the same. Sometimes we might be
       provided with an intercept. Other times we might be provided with an output value. We must be careful to analyze the
       information we are given, and use it appropriately to build a linear model.

      Using a Given Intercept to Build a Model

       Some real-world problems provide the vertical axis intercept, which is the constant or initial value. Once the vertical axis
       intercept is known, the t-intercept (horizontal axis intercept) can be calculated. Suppose, for example, that Hannah plans
       to pay off a no-interest loan from her parents. Her loan balance is $1,000. She plans to pay $250 per month until her
       balance is $0. The y-intercept is the initial amount of her debt, or $1,000. The rate of change, or slope, is -$250 per
       month. We can then use the slope-intercept form and the given information to develop a linear model.

       Now we can set the function equal to 0, and solve for to find the x-intercept.

The x-intercept is the number of months it takes her to reach a balance of $0. The x-intercept is 4 months, so it will take
Hannah four months to pay off her loan.

Using a Given Input and Output to Build a Model

Many real-world applications are not as direct as the ones we just considered. Instead they require us to identify some
aspect of a linear function. We might sometimes instead be asked to evaluate the linear model at a given input or set the
equation of the linear model equal to a specified output.

EXAMPLE 1

Using a Linear Model to Investigate a Town's Population
A town's population has been growing linearly. In 2004, the population was 6,200. By 2009, the population had grown to
8,100. Assume this trend continues.

 Predict the population in 2013.   Identify the year in which the population will reach 15,000.

     Solution

The two changing quantities are the population size and time. While we could use the actual year value as the input

quantity, doing so tends to lead to very cumbersome equations because the y-intercept would correspond to the year 0,

more than 2000 years ago!

To make computation a little nicer, we will define our input as the number of years since 2004.

To predict the population in 2013 (  ), we would first need an equation for the population. Likewise, to find when the

population would reach 15,000, we would need to solve for the input that would provide an output of 15,000. To write an

equation, we need the initial value and the rate of change, or slope.

To determine the rate of change, we will use the change in output per change in input.

The problem gives us two input-output pairs. Converting them to match our defined variables, the year 2004 would

correspond to  giving the point           Notice that through our clever choice of variable definition, we have

"given" ourselves the y-intercept of the function. The year 2009 would correspond to    giving the point

The two coordinate pairs are         and  Recall that we encountered examples in which we were provided

two points earlier in the chapter. We can use these values to calculate the slope.

We already know the y-intercept of the line, so we can immediately write the equation:
To predict the population in 2013, we evaluate our function at

If the trend continues, our model predicts a population of 9,620 in 2013.

To find when the population will reach 15,000, we can set              and solve for

Our model predicts the population will reach 15,000 in a little more than 23 years after 2004, or somewhere around the
year 2027.

               doughnuts produced.

Using a Diagram to Build a Model

It is useful for many real-world applications to draw a picture to gain a sense of how the variables representing the input
and output may be used to answer a question. To draw the picture, first consider what the problem is asking for. Then,
determine the input and the output. The diagram should relate the variables. Often, geometrical shapes or figures are
422 4 · Linear Functions

       drawn. Distances are often traced out. If a right triangle is sketched, the Pythagorean Theorem relates the sides. If a
       rectangle is sketched, labeling width and height is helpful.

         EXAMPLE 2
       Using a Diagram to Model Distance Walked
       Anna and Emanuel start at the same intersection. Anna walks east at 4 miles per hour while Emanuel walks south at 3
       miles per hour. They are communicating with a two-way radio that has a range of 2 miles. How long after they start
       walking will they fall out of radio contact?

            Solution
       In essence, we can partially answer this question by saying they will fall out of radio contact when they are 2 miles apart,
       which leads us to ask a new question:
       "How long will it take them to be 2 miles apart"?
       In this problem, our changing quantities are time and position, but ultimately we need to know how long will it take for
       them to be 2 miles apart. We can see that time will be our input variable, so we'll define our input and output variables.

       Because it is not obvious how to define our output variable, we'll start by drawing a picture such as Figure 2.

                                      Figure 2

Initial Value: They both start at the same intersection so when  the distance traveled by each person should also be
0. Thus the initial value for each is 0.

Rate of Change: Anna is walking 4 miles per hour and Emanuel is walking 3 miles per hour, which are both rates of
change. The slope for is 4 and the slope for is 3.

Using those values, we can write formulas for the distance each person has walked.

For this problem, the distances from the starting point are important. To notate these, we can define a coordinate
system, identifying the "starting point" at the intersection where they both started. Then we can use the variable,
which we introduced above, to represent Anna's position, and define it to be a measurement from the starting point in
the eastward direction. Likewise, can use the variable, to represent Emanuel's position, measured from the starting
point in the southward direction. Note that in defining the coordinate system, we specified both the starting point of the
measurement and the direction of measure.

We can then define a third variable, to be the measurement of the distance between Anna and Emanuel. Showing the
variables on the diagram is often helpful, as we can see from Figure 3.

Recall that we need to know how long it takes for the distance between them, to equal 2 miles. Notice that for any

given input the outputs          and  represent distances.

Figure 2 shows us that we can use the Pythagorean Theorem because we have drawn a right angle.
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we get:

In this scenario we are considering only positive values of so our distance  will always be positive. We can simplify

this answer to  This means that the distance between Anna and Emanuel is also a linear function. Because is

a linear function, we can now answer the question of when the distance between them will reach 2 miles. We will set the

output          and solve for

They will fall out of radio contact in 0.4 hour, or 24 minutes.

Q&A             Should I draw diagrams when given information based on a geometric shape?
                Yes. Sketch the figure and label the quantities and unknowns on the sketch.

EXAMPLE 3

Using a Diagram to Model Distance Between Cities
There is a straight road leading from the town of Westborough to Agritown 30 miles east and 10 miles north. Partway
down this road, it junctions with a second road, perpendicular to the first, leading to the town of Eastborough. If the
town of Eastborough is located 20 miles directly east of the town of Westborough, how far is the road junction from
Westborough?

Solution

It might help here to draw a picture of the situation. See Figure 4. It would then be helpful to introduce a coordinate

system. While we could place the origin anywhere, placing it at Westborough seems convenient. This puts Agritown at

coordinates     and Eastborough at
424 4 · Linear Functions

                                                                              Figure 4
Using this point along with the origin, we can find the slope of the line from Westborough to Agritown.

Now we can write an equation to describe the road from Westborough to Agritown.

From this, we can determine the perpendicular road to Eastborough will have slope  Because the town of
Eastborough is at the point (20, 0), we can find the equation.

We can now find the coordinates of the junction of the roads by finding the intersection of these lines. Setting them
equal,

The roads intersect at the point (18, 6). Using the distance formula, we can now find the distance from Westborough to
the junction.

     Analysis
One nice use of linear models is to take advantage of the fact that the graphs of these functions are lines. This means
real-world applications discussing maps need linear functions to model the distances between reference points.

TRY IT #3                 There is a straight road leading from the town of Timpson to Ashburn 60 miles east and 12 miles

                          to the town of Garrison. If the town of Garrison is located 22 miles directly east of the town of
                          Timpson, how far is the road junction from Timpson?

Jamal is choosing between two truck-rental companies. The first, Keep on Trucking, Inc., charges an up-front fee of $20,
then 59 cents a mile. The second, Move It Your Way, charges an up-front fee of $16, then 63 cents a mile4 . When will
Keep on Trucking, Inc. be the better choice for Jamal?

     Solution
The two important quantities in this problem are the cost and the number of miles driven. Because we have two
companies to consider, we will define two functions in Table 1.

             Input                                distance driven in miles

             Outputs                              cost, in dollars, for renting from Keep on Trucking

                                                  Using the rates of change and initial charges, we can write the equations

Using these equations, we can determine when Keep on Trucking, Inc., will be the better choice. Because all we have to
make that decision from is the costs, we are looking for when Move It Your Way, will cost less, or when
The solution pathway will lead us to find the equations for the two functions, find the intersection, and then see where

To find the intersection, we set the equations equal and solve:

This tells us that the cost from the two companies will be the same if 100 miles are driven. Either by looking at the graph,

or noting that            is growing at a slower rate, we can conclude that Keep on Trucking, Inc. will be the cheaper price

when more than 100 miles are driven, that is  .

Objectives: Plot points in a rectangular coordinate system (IA 3.1.1) and find an equation of the line
given two points. (IA 3.3.3)

In this section we will be plotting collections of data points and looking for patterns in these data sets. A scatterplot is a
collection of points plotted on the same coordinate system. When trying to fit a function to a data set it is important to
note if there is a pattern to the data set and whether that pattern is linear or nonlinear. If the dependent variable
increases as the independent variable increases, we call this a positive association. If the dependent variable decreases
as the independent variable increases, we call this a negative association.

       A professor is attempting to identify trends among final exam scores. His class has a mixture of students, so he wonders
       if there is any relationship between age and final exam scores. One way for him to analyze the scores is by creating a
       diagram that relates the age of each student to the exam score received. In this section, we will examine one such
       diagram known as a scatter plot.

     Drawing and Interpreting Scatter Plots

       A scatter plot is a graph of plotted points that may show a relationship between two sets of data. If the relationship is
       from a linear model, or a model that is nearly linear, the professor can draw conclusions using his knowledge of linear
       functions. Figure 1 shows a sample scatter plot.

                                          Figure 1 A scatter plot of age and final exam score variables
Notice this scatter plot does not indicate a linear relationship. The points do not appear to follow a trend. In other words,
there does not appear to be a relationship between the age of the student and the score on the final exam.

  EXAMPLE 1

Using a Scatter Plot to Investigate Cricket Chirps
The table below shows the number of cricket chirps in 15 seconds, for several different air temperatures, in degrees
Fahrenheit5 . Plot this data, and determine whether the data appears to be linearly related.

Chirps  44 35 20.4 33 31 35 18.5 37 26

Temperature 80.5 70.5 57 66 68 72 52 73.5 53

Table 1 Cricket Chirps vs Air Temperature

     Solution
Plotting this data, as depicted in Figure 2 suggests that there may be a trend. We can see from the trend in the data that
the number of chirps increases as the temperature increases. The trend appears to be roughly linear, though certainly
not perfectly so.

Finding the Line of Best Fit

Once we recognize a need for a linear function to model that data, the natural follow-up question is "what is that linear
function?" One way to approximate our linear function is to sketch the line that seems to best fit the data. Then we can
extend the line until we can verify the y-intercept. We can approximate the slope of the line by extending it until we can
estimate the

  EXAMPLE 2

Finding a Line of Best Fit
Find a linear function that fits the data in Table 1 by "eyeballing" a line that seems to fit.

     Solution
On a graph, we could try sketching a line. Using the starting and ending points of our hand drawn line, points (0, 30) and
(50, 90), this graph has a slope of

and a y-intercept at 30. This gives an equation of

where is the number of chirps in 15 seconds, and    is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. The resulting
equation is represented in Figure 3.

                                                                              Figure 3

     Analysis
This linear equation can then be used to approximate answers to various questions we might ask about the trend.

Recognizing Interpolation or Extrapolation

While the data for most examples does not fall perfectly on the line, the equation is our best guess as to how the
relationship will behave outside of the values for which we have data. We use a process known as interpolation when
we predict a value inside the domain and range of the data. The process of extrapolation is used when we predict a
value outside the domain and range of the data.

Figure 4 compares the two processes for the cricket-chirp data addressed in Example 2. We can see that interpolation
would occur if we used our model to predict temperature when the values for chirps are between 18.5 and 44.
Extrapolation would occur if we used our model to predict temperature when the values for chirps are less than 18.5 or
greater than 44.

There is a difference between making predictions inside the domain and range of values for which we have data and

outside that domain and range. Predicting a value outside of the domain and range has its limitations. When our model

no longer applies after a certain point, it is sometimes called model breakdown. For example, predicting a cost function

for a period of two years may involve examining the data where the input is the time in years and the output is the cost.

But if we try to extrapolate a cost when        that is in 50 years, the model would not apply because we could not

account for factors fifty years in the future.

Figure 4 Interpolation occurs within the domain and range of the provided data whereas extrapolation occurs outside.
  Interpolation and Extrapolation
  Different methods of making predictions are used to analyze data.
  The method of interpolation involves predicting a value inside the domain and/or range of the data.
  The method of extrapolation involves predicting a value outside the domain and/or range of the data.
  Model breakdown occurs at the point when the model no longer applies.
  EXAMPLE 3
Understanding Interpolation and Extrapolation
Use the cricket data from Table 1 to answer the following questions:

 Would predicting the temperature when crickets are chirping 30 times in 15 seconds be interpolation or

extrapolation? Make the prediction, and discuss whether it is reasonable.

 Would predicting the number of chirps crickets will make at 40 degrees be interpolation or extrapolation? Make

the prediction, and discuss whether it is reasonable.
     Solution

 The number of chirps in the data provided varied from 18.5 to 44. A prediction at 30 chirps per 15 seconds is

inside the domain of our data, so would be interpolation. Using our model:
Based on the data we have, this value seems reasonable.

 The temperature values varied from 52 to 80.5. Predicting the number of chirps at 40 degrees is extrapolation

because 40 is outside the range of our data. Using our model:

We can compare the regions of interpolation and extrapolation using Figure 5.

     Analysis
Our model predicts the crickets would chirp 8.33 times in 15 seconds. While this might be possible, we have no reason to
believe our model is valid outside the domain and range. In fact, generally crickets stop chirping altogether below
around 50 degrees.

TRY IT #2                 According to the data from Table 1, what temperature can we predict it is if we counted 20 chirps
                          in 15 seconds?

Finding the Line of Best Fit Using a Graphing Utility

While eyeballing a line works reasonably well, there are statistical techniques for fitting a line to data that minimize the
differences between the line and data values6 . One such technique is called least squares regression and can be
computed by many graphing calculators, spreadsheet software, statistical software, and many web-based calculators7 .
Least squares regression is one means to determine the line that best fits the data, and here we will refer to this method
as linear regression.

             ...

                 HOW TO

  Given data of input and corresponding outputs from a linear function, find the best fit line using linear
  regression.

   1. Enter the input in List 1 (L1).
   2. Enter the output in List 2 (L2).
   3. On a graphing utility, select Linear Regression (LinReg).

 3. On a graphing utility, select Linear Regression (LinReg). Using the cricket chirp data from earlier, with technology

      we obtain the equation:

     Analysis
Notice that this line is quite similar to the equation we "eyeballed" but should fit the data better. Notice also that using
this equation would change our prediction for the temperature when hearing 30 chirps in 15 seconds from 66 degrees
to:

The graph of the scatter plot with the least squares regression line is shown in Figure 6.

     Figure 6

Q&A  Will there ever be a case where two different lines will serve as the best fit for the data?
     No. There is only one best fit line.

Distinguishing Between Linear and Nonlinear Models

As we saw above with the cricket-chirp model, some data exhibit strong linear trends, but other data, like the final exam
scores plotted by age, are clearly nonlinear. Most calculators and computer software can also provide us with the
correlation coefficient, which is a measure of how closely the line fits the data. Many graphing calculators require the
user to turn a "diagnostic on" selection to find the correlation coefficient, which mathematicians label as The
correlation coefficient provides an easy way to get an idea of how close to a line the data falls.

We should compute the correlation coefficient only for data that follows a linear pattern or to determine the degree to
which a data set is linear. If the data exhibits a nonlinear pattern, the correlation coefficient for a linear regression is
meaningless. To get a sense for the relationship between the value of and the graph of the data, Figure 7 shows some
large data sets with their correlation coefficients. Remember, for all plots, the horizontal axis shows the input and the
vertical axis shows the output.

Correlation Coefficient

The correlation coefficient is a value, between -1 and 1.

·             suggests a positive (increasing) relationship

·             suggests a negative (decreasing) relationship

· The closer the value is to 0, the more scattered the data.

· The closer the value is to 1 or -1, the less scattered the data is.

EXAMPLE 5

Finding a Correlation Coefficient
Calculate the correlation coefficient for cricket-chirp data in Table 1.

Solution

Because the data appear to follow a linear pattern, we can use technology to calculate Enter the inputs and

corresponding outputs and select the Linear Regression. The calculator will also provide you with the correlation

coefficient,              This value is very close to 1, which suggests a strong increasing linear relationship.

Note: For some calculators, the Diagnostics must be turned "on" in order to get the correlation coefficient when linear
regression is performed: [2nd]>[0]>[alpha][x-1], then scroll to DIAGNOSTICSON.

Fitting a Regression Line to a Set of Data

Once we determine that a set of data is linear using the correlation coefficient, we can use the regression line to make
predictions. As we learned above, a regression line is a line that is closest to the data in the scatter plot, which means
that only one such line is a best fit for the data.

Key Concepts

4.1 Linear Functions

· Linear functions can be represented in words, function notation, tabular form, and graphical form. See Example 1.

· An increasing linear function results in a graph that slants upward from left to right and has a positive slope. A

decreasing linear function results in a graph that slants downward from left to right and has a negative slope. A

constant linear function results in a graph that is a horizontal line. See Example 2.

· Slope is a rate of change. The slope of a linear function can be calculated by dividing the difference between

y-values by the difference in corresponding x-values of any two points on the line. See Example 3 and Example 4.

· An equation for a linear function can be written from a graph. See Example 5.

· The equation for a linear function can be written if the slope and initial value are known. See Example 6 and

Example 7.

· A linear function can be used to solve real-world problems given information in different forms. See Example 8,

Example 9, and Example 10.

· Linear functions can be graphed by plotting points or by using the y-intercept and slope. See Example 11 and

Example 12.

· Graphs of linear functions may be transformed by using shifts up, down, left, or right, as well as through stretches,

compressions, and reflections. See Example 13.

· The equation for a linear function can be written by interpreting the graph. See Example 14.

· The x-intercept is the point at which the graph of a linear function crosses the x-axis. See Example 15.

· Horizontal lines are written in the form,           See Example 16.

· Vertical lines are written in the form,    See Example 17.

· Parallel lines have the same slope. Perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal slopes, assuming neither is vertical.

See Example 18.

· A line parallel to another line, passing through a given point, may be found by substituting the slope value of the

line and the x- and y-values of the given point into the equation,                and using the that results.

Similarly, the point-slope form of an equation can also be used. See Example 19.

· A line perpendicular to another line, passing through a given point, may be found in the same manner, with the

exception of using the negative reciprocal slope. See Example 20 and Example 21.

4.2 Modeling with Linear Functions

· We can use the same problem strategies that we would use for any type of function.
· When modeling and solving a problem, identify the variables and look for key values, including the slope and

   y-intercept. See Example 1.
· Draw a diagram, where appropriate. See Example 2 and Example 3.
· Check for reasonableness of the answer.

· Linear models may be built by identifying or calculating the slope and using the y-intercept.

 The x-intercept may be found by setting           which is setting the expression     equal to 0.

 The point of intersection of a system of linear equations is the point where the x- and y-values are the same. See

Example 4.

 A graph of the system may be used to identify the points where one line falls below (or above) the other line.

4.3 Fitting Linear Models to Data

· Scatter plots show the relationship between two sets of data. See Example 1.
· Scatter plots may represent linear or non-linear models.
· The line of best fit may be estimated or calculated, using a calculator or statistical software. See Example 2.
· Interpolation can be used to predict values inside the domain and range of the data, whereas extrapolation can be

    used to predict values outside the domain and range of the data. See Example 3.
· The correlation coefficient, indicates the degree of linear relationship between data. See Example 4.
· A regression line best fits the data. See Example 5.
· The least squares regression line is found by minimizing the squares of the distances of points from a line passing

    through the data and may be used to make predictions regarding either of the variables. See Example 6.

Whether they think about it in mathematical terms or not, scuba divers must consider the impact of functional
relationships in order to remain safe. The gas laws, which are a series of relations and equations that describe the
behavior of most gases, play a core role in diving. This diver, near the wreck of a World War II Japanese ocean liner
turned troop transport, must remain attentive to gas laws during their dive and as they ascend to the surface. (credit:

You don't need to dive very deep to feel the effects of pressure. As a person in their neighborhood pool moves eight,
ten, twelve feet down, they often feel pain in their ears as a result of water and air pressure differentials. Pressure plays
a much greater role at ocean diving depths.

id="scuban">Scuba and free divers are constantly negotiating the effects of pressure in order to experience enjoyable,
safe, and productive dives. Gases in a person's respiratory system and diving apparatus interact according to certain
physical properties, which upon discovery and evaluation are collectively known as the gas laws. Some are conceptually
simple, such as the inverse relationship regarding pressure and volume, and others are more complex. While their
formulas seem more straightforward than many you will encounter in this chapter, the gas laws are generally
polynomial expressions.

Curved antennas, such as the ones shown in Figure 1, are commonly used to focus microwaves and radio waves to
transmit television and telephone signals, as well as satellite and spacecraft communication. The cross-section of the
antenna is in the shape of a parabola, which can be described by a quadratic function.

In this section, we will investigate quadratic functions, which frequently model problems involving area and projectile
motion. Working with quadratic functions can be less complex than working with higher degree functions, so they
provide a good opportunity for a detailed study of function behavior.

Recognizing Characteristics of Parabolas

The graph of a quadratic function is a U-shaped curve called a parabola. One important feature of the graph is that it has
an extreme point, called the vertex. If the parabola opens up, the vertex represents the lowest point on the graph, or
the minimum value of the quadratic function. If the parabola opens down, the vertex represents the highest point on the
graph, or the maximum value. In either case, the vertex is a turning point on the graph. The graph is also symmetric with
a vertical line drawn through the vertex, called the axis of symmetry. These features are illustrated in Figure 2.

                                                                              Figure 2

The y-intercept is the point at which the parabola crosses the y-axis. The x-intercepts are the points at which the
parabola crosses the x-axis. If they exist, the x-intercepts represent the zeros, or roots, of the quadratic function, the
values of at which

                                        Figure 3

Solution

The vertex is the turning point of the graph. We can see that the vertex is at          Because this parabola opens upward,

the axis of symmetry is the vertical line that intersects the parabola at the vertex. So the axis of symmetry is       This

parabola does not cross the axis, so it has no zeros. It crosses the axis at            so this is the y-intercept.

Understanding How the Graphs of Parabolas are Related to Their Quadratic
Functions

The general form of a quadratic function presents the function in the form

where and are real numbers and      If  the parabola opens upward. If                   the parabola opens

downward. We can use the general form of a parabola to find the equation for the axis of symmetry.

The axis of symmetry is defined by  If we use the quadratic formula,                    to solve

               for the intercepts, or zeros, we find the value of halfway between them is always                     the

equation for the axis of symmetry.

Figure 4 represents the graph of the quadratic function written in general form as      In this form,
                                                                                                      This also
          and  Because              the parabola opens upward. The axis of symmetry is

makes sense because we can see from the graph that the vertical line            divides the graph in half. The vertex

always occurs along the axis of symmetry. For a parabola that opens upward, the vertex occurs at the lowest point on

the graph, in this instance,        The intercepts, those points where the parabola crosses the axis, occur at

and

                                                                              Figure 4
The standard form of a quadratic function presents the function in the form

where      is the vertex. Because the vertex appears in the standard form of the quadratic function, this form is also

known as the vertex form of a quadratic function.

As with the general form, if               the parabola opens upward and the vertex is a minimum. If  the parabola opens

downward, and the vertex is a maximum. Figure 5 represents the graph of the quadratic function written in standard

4 units upward. If  the graph shifts toward the right and if    the graph shifts to the left. In Figure 5,             so

the graph is shifted 2 units to the left. The magnitude of indicates the stretch of the graph. If     the point

associated with a particular value shifts farther from the x-axis, so the graph appears to become narrower, and there

is a vertical stretch. But if              the point associated with a particular value shifts closer to the x-axis, so the graph

appears to become wider, but in fact there is a vertical compression. In Figure 5,  so the graph becomes

narrower.

The standard form and the general form are equivalent methods of describing the same function. We can see this by
expanding out the general form and setting it equal to the standard form.

Finding the Domain and Range of a Quadratic Function

Any number can be the input value of a quadratic function. Therefore, the domain of any quadratic function is all real
numbers. Because parabolas have a maximum or a minimum point, the range is restricted. Since the vertex of a
parabola will be either a maximum or a minimum, the range will consist of all y-values greater than or equal to the
y-coordinate at the turning point or less than or equal to the y-coordinate at the turning point, depending on whether
the parabola opens up or down.

Domain and Range of a Quadratic Function

The domain of any quadratic function is all real numbers unless the context of the function presents some
restrictions.

The output of the quadratic function at the vertex is the maximum or minimum value of the function, depending on the

There are many real-world scenarios that involve finding the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function, such
as applications involving area and revenue.

  EXAMPLE 5

Finding the Maximum Value of a Quadratic Function
A backyard farmer wants to enclose a rectangular space for a new garden within her fenced backyard. She has
purchased 80 feet of wire fencing to enclose three sides, and she will use a section of the backyard fence as the fourth
side.

 Find a formula for the area enclosed by the fence if the sides of fencing perpendicular to the existing fence have

length

 What dimensions should she make her garden to maximize the enclosed area?

     Solution
Let's use a diagram such as Figure 10 to record the given information. It is also helpful to introduce a temporary
variable, to represent the width of the garden and the length of the fence section parallel to the backyard fence.
472 5 · Polynomial and Rational Functions

                                                Figure 10

 We know we have only 80 feet of fence available, and                          or more simply,  This

allows us to represent the width, in terms of

Now we are ready to write an equation for the area the fence encloses. We know the area of a rectangle is length
multiplied by width, so

This formula represents the area of the fence in terms of the variable length  The function, written in general form,
is

 The quadratic has a negative leading coefficient, so the graph will open downward, and the vertex will be the

maximum value for the area. In finding the vertex, we must be careful because the equation is not written in standard

polynomial form with decreasing powers. This is why we rewrote the function in general form above. Since is the

coefficient of the squared term,           and

To find the vertex:

The maximum value of the function is an area of 800 square feet, which occurs when              feet. When the shorter

sides are 20 feet, there is 40 feet of fencing left for the longer side. To maximize the area, she should enclose the garden

so the two shorter sides have length 20 feet and the longer side parallel to the existing fence has length 40 feet.

     Analysis
This problem also could be solved by graphing the quadratic function. We can see where the maximum area occurs on a
graph of the quadratic function in Figure 11.

              HOW TO

Given an application involving revenue, use a quadratic equation to find the maximum.
 1. Write a quadratic equation for a revenue function.
 2. Find the vertex of the quadratic equation.
 3. Determine the y-value of the vertex.

EXAMPLE 6

Finding Maximum Revenue
The unit price of an item affects its supply and demand. That is, if the unit price goes up, the demand for the item will
usually decrease. For example, a local newspaper currently has 84,000 subscribers at a quarterly charge of $30. Market
research has suggested that if the owners raise the price to $32, they would lose 5,000 subscribers. Assuming that
subscriptions are linearly related to the price, what price should the newspaper charge for a quarterly subscription to
maximize their revenue?

     Solution
Revenue is the amount of money a company brings in. In this case, the revenue can be found by multiplying the price
per subscription times the number of subscribers, or quantity. We can introduce variables, for price per subscription
and for quantity, giving us the equation

Because the number of subscribers changes with the price, we need to find a relationship between the variables. We

know that currently  and                      We also know that if the price rises to $32, the newspaper would lose 5,000

subscribers, giving a second pair of values,  and  From this we can find a linear equation relating the

two quantities. The slope will be

This tells us the paper will lose 2,500 subscribers for each dollar they raise the price. We can then solve for the
y-intercept.

This gives us the linear equation                  relating cost and subscribers. We now return to our revenue
equation.
474 5 · Polynomial and Rational Functions

       We now have a quadratic function for revenue as a function of the subscription charge. To find the price that will
       maximize revenue for the newspaper, we can find the vertex.

       The model tells us that the maximum revenue will occur if the newspaper charges $31.80 for a subscription. To find what
       the maximum revenue is, we evaluate the revenue function.

            Analysis
       This could also be solved by graphing the quadratic as in Figure 12. We can see the maximum revenue on a graph of the
       quadratic function.

depending upon the location of the graph.

 To find the maximum height, find the coordinate of the vertex of the parabola.

Objective 2: Determine the degree of polynomials (IA 5.1.1).

A term can be a number like -2, a variable like x, or a product of numbers and variables like .

A polynomial is an expression with more than one term with no variables in the denominator and no negative
exponents. Any exponent on the variables must be whole numbers.

For example                                are polynomials.

There are three particular types of polynomials:

A monomial is a one term polynomial like or 2.

A binomial is a two term polynomial like          .

A trinomial is a three term polynomial like                  .

The degree of a polynomial in one variable is the highest exponent that appears on the variable in the polynomial. For

example, the polynomial                    has only one variable, . The highest exponent on is 2.

EXAMPLE 2

Determine the degree of polynomials.
If the expression is a polynomial, identify it as a monomial, binomial, trinomial, or other polynomial, and then find the
degree of each polynomial. If it is not a polynomial, state this and give a reason why.

Suppose a certain species of bird thrives on a small island. Its population over the last few years is shown in Table 1.

                  Year

         Bird Population

         Table 1

The population can be estimated using the function            where represents the bird

population on the island years after 2009. We can use this model to estimate the maximum bird population and when it

will occur. We can also use this model to predict when the bird population will disappear from the island. In this section,

we will examine functions that we can use to estimate and predict these types of changes.

Identifying Power Functions

Before we can understand the bird problem, it will be helpful to understand a different type of function. A power
function is a function with a single term that is the product of a real number, a coefficient, and a variable raised to a
fixed real number.

As an example, consider functions for area or volume. The function for the area of a circle with radius is

and the function for the volume of a sphere with radius is

Both of these are examples of power functions because they consist of a coefficient, or    multiplied by a variable
raised to a power.

  Power Function

  A power function is a function that can be represented in the form

where and are real numbers, and is known as the coefficient.

Q&A  Is  a power function?

     No. A power function contains a variable base raised to a fixed power. This function has a constant base
     raised to a variable power. This is called an exponential function, not a power function.

       Identifying Power Functions
       Which of the following functions are power functions?

     Solution
All of the listed functions are power functions.

The constant and identity functions are power functions because they can be written as       and

respectively.

number powers. Notice that these graphs have similar shapes, very much like that of the quadratic function in the

the origin.

positive infinity and for negative infinity. When we say that " approaches infinity," which can be symbolically

negative infinity, the  values increase without bound. In symbolic form, we could write

number powers. Notice that these graphs look similar to the cubic function in the toolkit. Again, as the power increases,

the graphs flatten near the origin and become steeper away from the origin.

These examples illustrate that functions of the form         reveal symmetry of one kind or another. First, in Figure 2

we see that even functions of the form                even, are symmetric about the axis. In Figure 3 we see that odd

functions of the form         odd, are symmetric about the origin.

For these odd power functions, as approaches negative infinity,    decreases without bound. As approaches

positive infinity,      increases without bound. In symbolic form we write

                                                                   

                                                                 

The behavior of the graph of a function as the input values get very small (   ) and get very large (    ) is

referred to as the end behavior of the function. We can use words or symbols to describe end behavior.

Identifying Polynomial Functions

An oil pipeline bursts in the Gulf of Mexico, causing an oil slick in a roughly circular shape. The slick is currently 24 miles
in radius, but that radius is increasing by 8 miles each week. We want to write a formula for the area covered by the oil
slick by combining two functions. The radius of the spill depends on the number of weeks that have passed. This
relationship is linear.

We can combine this with the formula for the area of a circle.

Composing these functions gives a formula for the area in terms of weeks.

Multiplying gives the formula.

This formula is an example of a polynomial function. A polynomial function consists of either zero or the sum of a finite
number of non-zero terms, each of which is a product of a number, called the coefficient of the term, and a variable
raised to a non-negative integer power.

  Polynomial Functions

  Let be a non-negative integer. A polynomial function is a function that can be written in the form

Identifying the Degree and Leading Coefficient of a Polynomial Function

Because of the form of a polynomial function, we can see an infinite variety in the number of terms and the power of the
variable. Although the order of the terms in the polynomial function is not important for performing operations, we
typically arrange the terms in descending order of power, or in general form. The degree of the polynomial is the
highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial; it is the power of the first variable if the function is in
general form. The leading term is the term containing the highest power of the variable, or the term with the highest
degree. The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the leading term.

  Terminology of Polynomial Functions

  We often rearrange polynomials so that the powers are descending.

  When a polynomial is written in this way, we say that it is in general form.

Identifying End Behavior of Polynomial Functions

Knowing the degree of a polynomial function is useful in helping us predict its end behavior. To determine its end
behavior, look at the leading term of the polynomial function. Because the power of the leading term is the highest, that
term will grow significantly faster than the other terms as gets very large or very small, so its behavior will dominate
the graph. For any polynomial, the end behavior of the polynomial will match the end behavior of the power function
consisting of the leading term. See Table 3.

In words, we could say that as values approach infinity, the function values approach infinity, and as values approach
negative infinity, the function values approach negative infinity.

We can tell this graph has the shape of an odd degree power function that has not been reflected, so the degree of the
polynomial creating this graph must be odd and the leading coefficient must be positive.

Identifying Local Behavior of Polynomial Functions

In addition to the end behavior of polynomial functions, we are also interested in what happens in the "middle" of the
function. In particular, we are interested in locations where graph behavior changes. A turning point is a point at which
the function values change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing.

We are also interested in the intercepts. As with all functions, the y-intercept is the point at which the graph intersects

the vertical axis. The point corresponds to the coordinate pair in which the input value is zero. Because a polynomial is a

function, only one output value corresponds to each input value so there can be only one y-intercept  The

x-intercepts occur at the input values that correspond to an output value of zero. It is possible to have more than one

x-intercept. See Figure 9.

                                                                            Figure 9

Intercepts and Turning Points of Polynomial Functions

A turning point of a graph is a point at which the graph changes direction from increasing to decreasing or
decreasing to increasing. The y-intercept is the point at which the function has an input value of zero. The x-intercepts

Comparing Smooth and Continuous Graphs

The degree of a polynomial function helps us to determine the number of x-intercepts and the number of turning points.
A polynomial function of degree is the product of factors, so it will have at most roots or zeros, or x-intercepts.
The graph of the polynomial function of degree must have at most turning points. This means the graph has at
most one fewer turning point than the degree of the polynomial or one fewer than the number of factors.

A continuous function has no breaks in its graph: the graph can be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper. A
smooth curve is a graph that has no sharp corners. The turning points of a smooth graph must always occur at rounded
curves. The graphs of polynomial functions are both continuous and smooth.

Polynomial functions of degree 2 or more have graphs that do not have sharp corners; recall that these types of graphs
are called smooth curves. Polynomial functions also display graphs that have no breaks. Curves with no breaks are called
continuous. Figure 1 shows a graph that represents a polynomial function and a graph that represents a function that is
not a polynomial.

Using Factoring to Find Zeros of Polynomial Functions

Recall that if is a polynomial function, the values of for which  are called zeros of If the equation of the

polynomial function can be factored, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the zeros.

We can use this method to find intercepts because at the intercepts we find the input values when the output value
is zero. For general polynomials, this can be a challenging prospect. While quadratics can be solved using the relatively
simple quadratic formula, the corresponding formulas for cubic and fourth-degree polynomials are not simple enough
to remember, and formulas do not exist for general higher-degree polynomials. Consequently, we will limit ourselves to
three cases:

1. The polynomial can be factored using known methods: greatest common factor and trinomial factoring.
2. The polynomial is given in factored form.
3. Technology is used to determine the intercepts.

Identifying Zeros and Their Multiplicities

Graphs behave differently at various x-intercepts. Sometimes, the graph will cross over the horizontal axis at an
intercept. Other times, the graph will touch the horizontal axis and "bounce" off.
Suppose, for example, we graph the function shown.

Notice in Figure 7 that the behavior of the function at each of the x-intercepts is different.

       Figure 7 Identifying the behavior of the graph at an x-intercept by examining the multiplicity of the zero.

The x-intercept       is the solution of equation           The graph passes directly through the x-intercept at

       The factor is linear (has a degree of 1), so the behavior near the intercept is like that of a line--it passes directly

through the intercept. We call this a single zero because the zero corresponds to a single factor of the function.

The x-intercept       is the repeated solution of equation               The graph touches the axis at the intercept and

changes direction. The factor is quadratic (degree 2), so the behavior near the intercept is like that of a quadratic--it

bounces off of the horizontal axis at the intercept.

The factor is repeated, that is, the factor  appears twice. The number of times a given factor appears in the

factored form of the equation of a polynomial is called the multiplicity. The zero associated with this factor,     has

multiplicity 2 because the factor            occurs twice.

The x-intercept       is the repeated solution of factor    The graph passes through the axis at the

intercept, but flattens out a bit first. This factor is cubic (degree 3), so the behavior near the intercept is like that of a

cubic--with the same S-shape near the intercept as the toolkit function  We call this a triple zero, or a zero

with multiplicity 3.

For zeros with even multiplicities, the graphs touch or are tangent to the x-axis. For zeros with odd multiplicities, the
graphs cross or intersect the x-axis. See Figure 8 for examples of graphs of polynomial functions with multiplicity 1, 2,
and 3.

                                                                              Figure 8

For higher even powers, such as 4, 6, and 8, the graph will still touch and bounce off of the horizontal axis but, for each
increasing even power, the graph will appear flatter as it approaches and leaves the x-axis.

For higher odd powers, such as 5, 7, and 9, the graph will still cross through the horizontal axis, but for each increasing
odd power, the graph will appear flatter as it approaches and leaves the x-axis.

Graphical Behavior of Polynomials at x-Intercepts

If a polynomial contains a factor of the form      the behavior near the intercept is determined by the power

We say that  is a zero of multiplicity

The graph of a polynomial function will touch the x-axis at zeros with even multiplicities. The graph will cross the
x-axis at zeros with odd multiplicities.

The sum of the multiplicities is the degree of the polynomial function.

Determining End Behavior

As we have already learned, the behavior of a graph of a polynomial function of the form

will either ultimately rise or fall as increases without bound and will either rise or fall as decreases without bound.
This is because for very large inputs, say 100 or 1,000, the leading term dominates the size of the output. The same is
true for very small inputs, say -100 or -1,000.
Recall that we call this behavior the end behavior of a function. As we pointed out when discussing quadratic equations,

when the leading term of a polynomial function,        is an even power function, as increases or decreases without

bound,  increases without bound. When the leading term is an odd power function, as decreases without bound,

also decreases without bound; as increases without bound,         also increases without bound. If the leading

term is negative, it will change the direction of the end behavior. Figure 11 summarizes all four cases.

Understanding the Relationship between Degree and Turning Points

In addition to the end behavior, recall that we can analyze a polynomial function's local behavior. It may have a turning

point where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing (rising to falling) or decreasing to increasing (falling to

rising). Look at the graph of the polynomial function             in Figure 12. The graph has three

turning points.

This function is a 4th degree polynomial function and has 3 turning points. The maximum number of turning points of
a polynomial function is always one less than the degree of the function.

Interpreting Turning Points

A turning point is a point of the graph where the graph changes from increasing to decreasing (rising to falling) or

Given a polynomial function, sketch the graph.
 1. Find the intercepts.
 2. Check for symmetry. If the function is an even function, its graph is symmetrical about the axis, that is,

                             If a function is an odd function, its graph is symmetrical about the origin, that is,

 3. Use the multiplicities of the zeros to determine the behavior of the polynomial at the intercepts.
 4. Determine the end behavior by examining the leading term.
 5. Use the end behavior and the behavior at the intercepts to sketch a graph.
 6. Ensure that the number of turning points does not exceed one less than the degree of the polynomial.
 7. Optionally, use technology to check the graph.

Solution

This graph has two x-intercepts. At     the factor is squared, indicating a multiplicity of 2. The graph will bounce at

this x-intercept. At  the function has a multiplicity of one, indicating the graph will cross through the axis at this

intercept.

The y-intercept is found by evaluating

The y-intercept is

Additionally, we can see the leading term, if this polynomial were multiplied out, would be  so the end behavior is

that of a vertically reflected cubic, with the outputs decreasing as the inputs approach infinity, and the outputs

increasing as the inputs approach negative infinity. See Figure 13.

To sketch this, we consider that:                              Figure 13

· Since                                    is not equal to  the graph does not display symmetry.
· At
         the graph bounces off of the x-axis, so the function must start increasing.
    At
         the graph crosses the y-axis at the y-intercept. See Figure 14.

                                            Figure 14

Somewhere after this point, the graph must turn back down or start decreasing toward the horizontal axis because the

graph passes through the next intercept at  See Figure 15.

the fourth quadrant.

Using the Intermediate Value Theorem

In some situations, we may know two points on a graph but not the zeros. If those two points are on opposite sides of

the x-axis, we can confirm that there is a zero between them. Consider a polynomial function whose graph is smooth

and continuous. The Intermediate Value Theorem states that for two numbers and in the domain of if            and

then the function takes on every value between              and  (While the theorem is intuitive, the

proof is actually quite complicated and requires higher mathematics.) We can apply this theorem to a special case that is

useful in graphing polynomial functions. If a point on the graph of a continuous function at       lies above the axis

and another point at  lies below the axis, there must exist a third point between             and  where the

graph crosses the axis. Call this point  This means that we are assured there is a solution where

In other words, the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that when a polynomial function changes from a negative value
to a positive value, the function must cross the axis. Figure 17 shows that there is a zero between and

Writing Formulas for Polynomial Functions

Now that we know how to find zeros of polynomial functions, we can use them to write formulas based on graphs.
Because a polynomial function written in factored form will have an x-intercept where each factor is equal to zero, we
can form a function that will pass through a set of x-intercepts by introducing a corresponding set of factors.

Factored Form of Polynomials

If a polynomial of lowest degree has horizontal intercepts at                then the polynomial can be written

in the factored form:                                              where the powers on each factor can be

determined by the behavior of the graph at the corresponding intercept, and the stretch factor can be determined

given a value of the function other than the x-intercept.

Using Local and Global Extrema

With quadratics, we were able to algebraically find the maximum or minimum value of the function by finding the vertex.
For general polynomials, finding these turning points is not possible without more advanced techniques from calculus.
Even then, finding where extrema occur can still be algebraically challenging. For now, we will estimate the locations of
turning points using technology to generate a graph.

Each turning point represents a local minimum or maximum. Sometimes, a turning point is the highest or lowest point
on the entire graph. In these cases, we say that the turning point is a global maximum or a global minimum. These are
also referred to as the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of the function.

Local and Global Extrema

A local maximum or local minimum at        (sometimes called the relative maximum or minimum, respectively) is

the output at the highest or lowest point on the graph in an open interval around  If a function has a local

maximum at then                            for all in an open interval around  If a function has a local minimum at

then  for all in an open interval around

A global maximum or global minimum is the output at the highest or lowest point of the function. If a function has

a global maximum at then                   for all If a function has a global minimum at then  for all

We can see the difference between local and global extrema in Figure 21.

Q&A   Do all polynomial functions have a global minimum or maximum?

      No. Only polynomial functions of even degree have a global minimum or maximum. For example,

then folding up the sides. Find the size of squares that should be cut out to maximize the volume enclosed by the box.

     Solution
We will start this problem by drawing a picture like that in Figure 22, labeling the width of the cut-out squares with a
variable,

                                                                             Figure 22  cm by  cm rectangle for the base of

Notice that after a square is cut out from each end, it leaves a
the box, and the box will be cm tall. This gives the volume

Notice, since the factors are          and  the three zeros are 10, 7, and 0, respectively. Because a height of 0

cm is not reasonable, we consider the only the zeros 10 and 7. The shortest side is 14 and we are cutting off two squares,

so values may take on are greater than zero or less than 7. This means we will restrict the domain of this function to

Using technology to sketch the graph of     on this reasonable domain, we get a graph like that in Figure

23. We can use this graph to estimate the maximum value for the volume, restricted to values for that are reasonable

for this problem--values from 0 to 7.

From this graph, we turn our focus to only the portion on the reasonable domain,               We can estimate the

maximum value to be around 340 cubic cm, which occurs when the squares are about 2.75 cm on each side. To improve

this estimate, we could use advanced features of our technology, if available, or simply change our window to zoom in

Objective 1: Dividing polynomials using long division (IA 5.4.3)

To divide a polynomial by a binomial, we follow a procedure very similar to long division of numbers. So, let's look
carefully at the steps we take when we divide a 3-digit number, 875, by a 2-digit number, 25.

  EXAMPLE 1

When we divided 875 by 25, we had no remainder. But sometimes division of numbers does leave a remainder.

Objective 2: Dividing polynomials using synthetic division (IA 5.4.4)

As you probably noticed, long division can be tedious. Synthetic division uses the patterns from long division as a basis
to make a process much simpler by leaving the variable terms out. The same example in synthetic division format is
shown next.

                                                                              Figure 2
Synthetic division only works when the divisor is of the form (x-c).

EXAMPLE 4

Use synthetic division to find the quotient and remainder when                                         is divided by x+4. Note that the
divisor is in the form x-(-4), so use c as the divisor.

Solution

The polynomial                  has its term in order with descending degree but we notice there is no x3term.

We will add a 0 as a placeholder for the term.

We divided a 4th degree polynomial by a 1st degree polynomial so the quotient will be a 3rd degree polynomial.

Reading from the third row, the quotient has the coefficients 1,-4,0, and 3, which is                  . The remainder

is 0.

The exterior of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., is a large rectangular solid with length 61.5 meters (m), width
40 m, and height 30 m.1 We can easily find the volume using elementary geometry.

So the volume is 73,800 cubic meters       Suppose we knew the volume, length, and width. We could divide to find the
height.

As we can confirm from the dimensions above, the height is 30 m. We can use similar methods to find any of the missing

dimensions. We can also use the same method if any, or all, of the measurements contain variable expressions. For

example, suppose the volume of a rectangular solid is given by the polynomial  The length of

the solid is given by the width is given by  To find the height of the solid, we can use polynomial division, which

is the focus of this section.

Using Long Division to Divide Polynomials

We are familiar with the long division algorithm for ordinary arithmetic. We begin by dividing into the digits of the
dividend that have the greatest place value. We divide, multiply, subtract, include the digit in the next place value
position, and repeat. For example, let's divide 178 by 3 using long division.

Another way to look at the solution is as a sum of parts. This should look familiar, since it is the same method used to
check division in elementary arithmetic.

We call this the Division Algorithm and will discuss it more formally after looking at an example.
Division of polynomials that contain more than one term has similarities to long division of whole numbers. We can write

a polynomial dividend as the product of the divisor and the quotient added to the remainder. The terms of the

polynomial division correspond to the digits (and place values) of the whole number division. This method allows us to

divide two polynomials. For example, if we were to divide                    by     using the long division algorithm,

it would look like this:

Using Synthetic Division to Divide Polynomials

As we've seen, long division of polynomials can involve many steps and be quite cumbersome. Synthetic division is a
shorthand method of dividing polynomials for the special case of dividing by a linear factor whose leading coefficient is
1.

To illustrate the process, recall the example at the beginning of the section.

Divide    by                         using the long division algorithm.

The final form of the process looked like this:

There is a lot of repetition in the table. If we don't write the variables but, instead, line up their coefficients in columns
under the division sign and also eliminate the partial products, we already have a simpler version of the entire problem.

Synthetic division carries this simplification even a few more steps. Collapse the table by moving each of the rows up to
fill any vacant spots. Also, instead of dividing by 2, as we would in division of whole numbers, then multiplying and
subtracting the middle product, we change the sign of the "divisor" to -2, multiply and add. The process starts by
bringing down the leading coefficient.
538 5 · Polynomial and Rational Functions

We then multiply it by the "divisor" and add, repeating this process column by column, until there are no entries left. The

bottom row represents the coefficients of the quotient; the last entry of the bottom row is the remainder. In this case,

the quotient is                  and the remainder is  The process will be made more clear in Example 3.

Synthetic Division

Synthetic division is a shortcut that can be used when the divisor is a binomial in the form    where is a real
number. In synthetic division, only the coefficients are used in the division process.

           ...

              HOW TO

Given two polynomials, use synthetic division to divide.

 1. Write for the divisor.
 2. Write the coefficients of the dividend.
 3. Bring the lead coefficient down.
 4. Multiply the lead coefficient by Write the product in the next column.
 5. Add the terms of the second column.
 6. Multiply the result by Write the product in the next column.
 7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining columns.
 8. Use the bottom numbers to write the quotient. The number in the last column is the remainder and has degree

      0, the next number from the right has degree 1, the next number from the right has degree 2, and so on.

EXAMPLE 3

     Solution

Continue by adding the numbers in the second column. Multiply the resulting number by           Write the result in the next
column. Then add the numbers in the third column.

The result is       The remainder is 0. So             is a factor of the original polynomial.

Evaluating a Polynomial Using the Remainder Theorem

In the last section, we learned how to divide polynomials. We can now use polynomial division to evaluate polynomials

using the Remainder Theorem. If the polynomial is divided by      the remainder may be found quickly by evaluating

the polynomial function at that is,    Let's walk through the proof of the theorem.

Recall that the Division Algorithm states that, given a polynomial dividend  and a non-zero polynomial divisor ,
there exist unique polynomials and such that

and either         or the degree of is less than the degree of . In practice divisors,        will have degrees less

than or equal to the degree of . If the divisor,  is          this takes the form

Since the divisor  is linear, the remainder will be a constant, And, if we evaluate this for  we have

In other words,    is the remainder obtained by dividing      by

Using the Factor Theorem to Solve a Polynomial Equation

The Factor Theorem is another theorem that helps us analyze polynomial equations. It tells us how the zeros of a
polynomial are related to the factors. Recall that the Division Algorithm.

If is a zero, then the remainder is            and                  or

Notice, written in this form,  is a factor of       We can conclude if is a zero of  then      is a factor of

Similarly, if  is a factor of  then the remainder of the Division Algorithm                            is 0. This tells

us that is a zero.

This pair of implications is the Factor Theorem. As we will soon see, a polynomial of degree in the complex number
system will have zeros. We can use the Factor Theorem to completely factor a polynomial into the product of factors.
Once the polynomial has been completely factored, we can easily determine the zeros of the polynomial.

Using the Rational Zero Theorem to Find Rational Zeros

Another use for the Remainder Theorem is to test whether a rational number is a zero for a given polynomial. But first
we need a pool of rational numbers to test. The Rational Zero Theorem helps us to narrow down the number of
possible rational zeros using the ratio of the factors of the constant term and factors of the leading coefficient of the
polynomial

Consider a quadratic function with two zeros,    and           By the Factor Theorem, these zeros have factors

associated with them. Let us set each factor equal to 0, and then construct the original quadratic function absent its
stretching factor.

Notice that two of the factors of the constant term, 6, are the two numerators from the original rational roots: 2 and 3.
Similarly, two of the factors from the leading coefficient, 20, are the two denominators from the original rational roots: 5
and 4.
We can infer that the numerators of the rational roots will always be factors of the constant term and the denominators
will be factors of the leading coefficient. This is the essence of the Rational Zero Theorem; it is a means to give us a pool
of possible rational zeros.

The Rational Zero Theorem

The Rational Zero Theorem states that, if the polynomial                                                         has integer
                                                                     is a factor of the constant term and is a

one that gives a remainder of 0. Let's begin with 1.

The quadratic is a perfect square.         can be written as

Using the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

Now that we can find rational zeros for a polynomial function, we will look at a theorem that discusses the number of
complex zeros of a polynomial function. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that every polynomial function
has at least one complex zero. This theorem forms the foundation for solving polynomial equations.

Suppose is a polynomial function of degree four, and            The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that there

is at least one complex solution, call it By the Factor Theorem, we can write  as a product of            and a

polynomial quotient. Since            is linear, the polynomial quotient will be of degree three. Now we apply the

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to the third-degree polynomial quotient. It will have at least one complex zero, call it

So we can write the polynomial quotient as a product of         and a new polynomial quotient of degree two.

Continue to apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra until all of the zeros are found. There will be four of them and

each one will yield a factor of

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that, if             is a polynomial of degree n > 0, then      has at least one
complex zero.

We can use this theorem to argue that, if  is a polynomial of degree           and is a non-zero real number, then
       has exactly linear factors

where  are complex numbers. Therefore,                         has roots if we allow for multiplicities.

Q&A    Does every polynomial have at least one imaginary zero?

       No. Real numbers are a subset of complex numbers, but not the other way around. A complex number is
       not necessarily imaginary. Real numbers are also complex numbers.

Analysis

Look at the graph of the function in Figure 2. Notice that, at  the graph crosses the x-axis, indicating an odd

multiplicity (1) for the zero              Also note the presence of the two turning points. This means that, since there is a 3rd

degree polynomial, we are looking at the maximum number of turning points. So, the end behavior of increasing

without bound to the right and decreasing without bound to the left will continue. Thus, all the x-intercepts for the

function are shown. So either the multiplicity of         is 1 and there are two complex solutions, which is what we

found, or the multiplicity at              is three. Either way, our result is correct.

                                                                              Figure 2

polynomial function into factors. The Linear Factorization Theorem tells us that a polynomial function will have the

same number of factors as its degree, and that each factor will be in the form     where is a complex number.

true because any factor other than           when multiplied by                  will leave imaginary components in the

other words, if a polynomial function with real coefficients has a complex zero    then the complex conjugate

must also be a zero of              This is called the Complex Conjugate Theorem.

Complex Conjugate Theorem

According to the Linear Factorization Theorem, a polynomial function will have the same number of factors as its

degree, and each factor will be in the form  , where is a complex number.

If the polynomial function has real coefficients and a complex zero in the form            then the complex conjugate

Using Descartes' Rule of Signs

There is a straightforward way to determine the possible numbers of positive and negative real zeros for any polynomial

function. If the polynomial is written in descending order, Descartes' Rule of Signs tells us of a relationship between the

number of sign changes in                  and the number of positive real zeros. For example, the polynomial function below has

one sign change.

This tells us that the function must have 1 positive real zero.        and the number of negative real zeros.
There is a similar relationship between the number of sign changes in

In this case,     has 3 sign changes. This tells us that  could have 3 or 1 negative real zeros.

Descartes' Rule of Signs

According to Descartes' Rule of Signs, if we let                                              be a polynomial function
with real coefficients:                                                                         or is less than the

Solving Real-World Applications

We have now introduced a variety of tools for solving polynomial equations. Let's use these tools to solve the bakery
problem from the beginning of the section.

  EXAMPLE 9

Solving Polynomial Equations
A new bakery offers decorated, multi-tiered cakes for display and cutting at Quinceañera and wedding celebrations, as

well as sheet cakes for children's birthday parties and other special occasions to serve most of the guests. The bakery
wants the volume of a small sheet cake to be 351 cubic inches. The cake is in the shape of a rectangular solid. They want
the length of the cake to be four inches longer than the width of the cake and the height of the cake to be one-third of
the width. What should the dimensions of the cake pan be?

     Solution                                                                                                     We were
Begin by writing an equation for the volume of the cake. The volume of a rectangular solid is given by
given that the length must be four inches longer than the width, so we can express the length of the cake as
We were given that the height of the cake is one-third of the width, so we can express the height of the cake as

Let's write the volume of the cake in terms of width of the cake.

Substitute the given volume into this equation.

Descartes' rule of signs tells us there is one positive solution. The Rational Zero Theorem tells us that the possible

rational zeros are                               and                          We can use synthetic division to

test these possible zeros. Only positive numbers make sense as dimensions for a cake, so we need not test any negative

values. Let's begin by testing values that make the most sense as dimensions for a small sheet cake. Use synthetic

division to check

Since 1 is not a solution, we will check

Since 3 is not a solution either, we will test

Synthetic division gives a remainder of 0, so 9 is a solution to the equation. We can use the relationships between the
width and the other dimensions to determine the length and height of the sheet cake pan.

The sheet cake pan should have dimensions 13 inches by 9 inches by 3 inches.

TRY IT #8           A shipping container in the shape of a rectangular solid must have a volume of 84 cubic meters.

                    be one meter longer than the width, and the height must be one meter greater than twice the
                    width. What should the dimensions of the container be?

patients in the camp hospital. A large mixing tank currently contains 100 gallons of distilled water into which 5 pounds of

poured into the tank at a rate of 1 pound per minute. Find the ratio of sugar to water, in pounds per gallon in the tank
after 12 minutes. Is that a greater ratio of sugar to water, in pounds per gallon than at the beginning?

     Solution
Let be the number of minutes since the tap opened. Since the water increases at 10 gallons per minute, and the sugar
increases at 1 pound per minute, these are constant rates of change. This tells us the amount of water in the tank is
changing linearly, as is the amount of sugar in the tank. We can write an equation independently for each:

The ratio of sugar to water, in pounds per gallon, , will be the ratio of pounds of sugar to gallons of water

The ratio of sugar to water, in pounds per gallon after 12 minutes is given by evaluating  at

This means the ratio of sugar to water, in pounds per gallon is 17 pounds of sugar to 220 gallons of water.

Finding the Domains of Rational Functions

A vertical asymptote represents a value at which a rational function is undefined, so that value is not in the domain of
the function. A reciprocal function cannot have values in its domain that cause the denominator to equal zero. In
general, to find the domain of a rational function, we need to determine which inputs would cause division by zero.

Identifying Vertical Asymptotes of Rational Functions

By looking at the graph of a rational function, we can investigate its local behavior and easily see whether there are
asymptotes. We may even be able to approximate their location. Even without the graph, however, we can still
determine whether a given rational function has any asymptotes, and calculate their location.

Vertical Asymptotes

The vertical asymptotes of a rational function may be found by examining the factors of the denominator that are not
common to the factors in the numerator. Vertical asymptotes occur at the zeros of such factors.

To find the vertical asymptotes, we determine where this function will be undefined by setting the denominator equal to
zero:

Neither  nor               are zeros of the numerator, so the two values indicate two vertical asymptotes. The graph in

Removable Discontinuities

call such a hole a removable discontinuity.

Identifying Horizontal Asymptotes of Rational Functions

While vertical asymptotes describe the behavior of a graph as the output gets very large or very small, horizontal
asymptotes help describe the behavior of a graph as the input gets very large or very small. Recall that a polynomial's
end behavior will mirror that of the leading term. Likewise, a rational function's end behavior will mirror that of the ratio
of the function that is the ratio of the leading terms.
There are three distinct outcomes when checking for horizontal asymptotes:
Case 1: If the degree of the denominator > degree of the numerator, there is a horizontal asymptote at

In this case, the end behavior is               This tells us that, as the inputs increase or decrease without bound, this

function will behave similarly to the function        and the outputs will approach zero, resulting in a horizontal

asymptote at  See Figure 12. Note that this graph crosses the horizontal asymptote.

In this case, the end behavior is                    This tells us that as the inputs increase or decrease without bound,

this function will behave similarly to the function             As the inputs grow large, the outputs will grow and not level

off, so this graph has no horizontal asymptote. However, the graph of            looks like a diagonal line, and since

       Notice that, while the graph of a rational function will never cross a vertical asymptote, the graph may or may not cross a
       horizontal or slant asymptote. Also, although the graph of a rational function may have many vertical asymptotes, the
       graph will have at most one horizontal (or slant) asymptote.
       It should be noted that, if the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator by more than one,
       the end behavior of the graph will mimic the behavior of the reduced end behavior fraction. For instance, if we had the
       function

with end behavior

the end behavior of the graph would look similar to that of an even polynomial with a positive leading coefficient.

                                                                       

Horizontal Asymptotes of Rational Functions

The horizontal asymptote of a rational function can be determined by looking at the degrees of the numerator and
denominator.

  · Degree of numerator is less than degree of denominator: horizontal asymptote at
  · Degree of numerator is greater than degree of denominator by one: no horizontal asymptote; slant asymptote.

Both the numerator and denominator are linear (degree 1). Because the degrees are equal, there will be a horizontal
asymptote at the ratio of the leading coefficients. In the numerator, the leading term is with coefficient 1. In the
denominator, the leading term is with coefficient 10. The horizontal asymptote will be at the ratio of these values:

The function will have vertical asymptotes when the denominator is zero, causing the function to be undefined. The

denominator will be zero at              indicating vertical asymptotes at these values.

The numerator has degree 2, while the denominator has degree 3. Since the degree of the denominator is greater than

the degree of the numerator, the denominator will grow faster than the numerator, causing the outputs to tend towards

zero as the inputs get large, and so as    This function will have a horizontal asymptote at                See

Intercepts of Rational Functions

A rational function will have a y-intercept at         , if the function is defined at zero. A rational function will not have a

y-intercept if the function is not defined at zero.

Likewise, a rational function will have x-intercepts at the inputs that cause the output to be zero. Since a fraction is
only equal to zero when the numerator is zero, x-intercepts can only occur when the numerator of the rational
function is equal to zero.

Graphing Rational Functions

In Example 9, we see that the numerator of a rational function reveals the x-intercepts of the graph, whereas the
denominator reveals the vertical asymptotes of the graph. As with polynomials, factors of the numerator may have
integer powers greater than one. Fortunately, the effect on the shape of the graph at those intercepts is the same as we
saw with polynomials.

The vertical asymptotes associated with the factors of the denominator will mirror one of the two toolkit reciprocal
functions. When the degree of the factor in the denominator is odd, the distinguishing characteristic is that on one side
of the vertical asymptote the graph heads towards positive infinity, and on the other side the graph heads towards
negative infinity. See Figure 17.

                                                                             Figure 17

When the degree of the factor in the denominator is even, the distinguishing characteristic is that the graph either heads
toward positive infinity on both sides of the vertical asymptote or heads toward negative infinity on both sides. See
Figure 18.

For example, the graph of             Figure 18
                           is shown in Figure 19.

     HOW TO

Given a rational function, sketch a graph.

 1. Evaluate the function at 0 to find the y-intercept.
 2. Factor the numerator and denominator.
 3. For factors in the numerator not common to the denominator, determine where each factor of the numerator is

      zero to find the x-intercepts.
 4. Find the multiplicities of the x-intercepts to determine the behavior of the graph at those points.
 5. For factors in the denominator, note the multiplicities of the zeros to determine the local behavior. For those

      factors not common to the numerator, find the vertical asymptotes by setting those factors equal to zero and
      then solve.
 6. For factors in the denominator common to factors in the numerator, find the removable discontinuities by
      setting those factors equal to 0 and then solve.
 7. Compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator to determine the horizontal or slant asymptotes.
 8. Sketch the graph.

  EXAMPLE 11

Graphing a Rational Function
Sketch a graph of

     Solution
We can start by noting that the function is already factored, saving us a step.
Next, we will find the intercepts. Evaluating the function at zero gives the y-intercept:

To find the x-intercepts, we determine when the numerator of the function is zero. Setting each factor equal to zero, we

find x-intercepts at      and  At each, the behavior will be linear (multiplicity 1), with the graph passing through

the intercept.

We have a y-intercept at       and x-intercepts at    and

To find the vertical asymptotes, we determine when the denominator is equal to zero. This occurs when  and

when            giving us vertical asymptotes at      and

There are no common factors in the numerator and denominator. This means there are no removable discontinuities.

Finally, the degree of denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator, telling us this graph has a horizontal
asymptote at

To sketch the graph, we might start by plotting the three intercepts. Since the graph has no x-intercepts between the
vertical asymptotes, and the y-intercept is positive, we know the function must remain positive between the asymptotes,
letting us fill in the middle portion of the graph as shown in Figure 20.

                                                      Figure 20

The factor associated with the vertical asymptote at       was squared, so we know the behavior will be the same on

both sides of the asymptote. The graph heads toward positive infinity as the inputs approach the asymptote on the right,

so the graph will head toward positive infinity on the left as well.

For the vertical asymptote at  the factor was not squared, so the graph will have opposite behavior on either side

of the asymptote. See Figure 21. After passing through the x-intercepts, the graph will then level off toward an output of

zero, as indicated by the horizontal asymptote.

Writing Rational Functions

Now that we have analyzed the equations for rational functions and how they relate to a graph of the function, we can
use information given by a graph to write the function. A rational function written in factored form will have an
x-intercept where each factor of the numerator is equal to zero. (An exception occurs in the case of a removable
discontinuity.) As a result, we can form a numerator of a function whose graph will pass through a set of x-intercepts by
introducing a corresponding set of factors. Likewise, because the function will have a vertical asymptote where each
factor of the denominator is equal to zero, we can form a denominator that will produce the vertical asymptotes by
introducing a corresponding set of factors.

Writing Rational Functions from Intercepts and Asymptotes

If a rational function has x-intercepts at     vertical asymptotes at   and no

then the function can be written in the form:

where the powers or on each factor can be determined by the behavior of the graph at the corresponding
intercept or asymptote, and the stretch factor can be determined given a value of the function other than the
x-intercept or by the horizontal asymptote if it is nonzero.

           ...

              HOW TO

Given a graph of a rational function, write the function.
 1. Determine the factors of the numerator. Examine the behavior of the graph at the x-intercepts to determine the

      zeroes and their multiplicities. (This is easy to do when finding the "simplest" function with small
      multiplicities--such as 1 or 3--but may be difficult for larger multiplicities--such as 5 or 7, for example.)
 2. Determine the factors of the denominator. Examine the behavior on both sides of each vertical asymptote to

   3. Use any clear point on the graph to find the stretch factor.

Solution

The graph appears to have x-intercepts at    and  At both, the graph passes through the intercept,

suggesting linear factors. The graph has two vertical asymptotes. The one at  seems to exhibit the basic behavior

similar to with the graph heading toward positive infinity on one side and heading toward negative infinity on the

other. The asymptote at  is exhibiting a behavior similar to with the graph heading toward negative infinity on

both sides of the asymptote. See Figure 23.

Finding the Inverse of a Polynomial Function

Two functions and are inverse functions if for every coordinate pair in  there exists a corresponding

coordinate pair in the inverse function,  In other words, the coordinate pairs of the inverse functions have the

input and output interchanged. Only one-to-one functions have inverses. Recall that a one-to-one function has a unique

output value for each input value and passes the horizontal line test.

For example, suppose the Sustainability Club builds a water runoff collector in the shape of a parabolic trough as shown
in Figure 2. We can use the information in the figure to find the surface area of the water in the trough as a function of
the depth of the water.

                                                                              Figure 2

Because it will be helpful to have an equation for the parabolic cross-sectional shape, we will impose a coordinate system
at the cross section, with measured horizontally and measured vertically, with the origin at the vertex of the
parabola. See Figure 3.
592 5 · Polynomial and Rational Functions

                                           Figure 3

From this we find an equation for the parabolic shape. We placed the origin at the vertex of the parabola, so we know

the equation will have form                Our equation will need to pass through the point (6, 18), from which we can

solve for the stretch factor

Our parabolic cross section has the equation

We are interested in the surface area of the water, so we must determine the width at the top of the water as a function
of the water depth. For any depth the width will be given by so we need to solve the equation above for and find
the inverse function. However, notice that the original function is not one-to-one, and indeed, given any output there are
two inputs that produce the same output, one positive and one negative.
To find an inverse, we can restrict our original function to a limited domain on which it is one-to-one. In this case, it
makes sense to restrict ourselves to positive values. On this domain, we can find an inverse by solving for the input
variable:

This is not a function as written. We are limiting ourselves to positive values, so we eliminate the negative solution,
giving us the inverse function we're looking for.

Because is the distance from the center of the parabola to either side, the entire width of the water at the top will be
     The trough is 3 feet (36 inches) long, so the surface area will then be:

This example illustrates two important points:
 1. When finding the inverse of a quadratic, we have to limit ourselves to a domain on which the function is one-to-one.
 2. The inverse of a quadratic function is a square root function. Both are toolkit functions and different types of power

Restricting the Domain to Find the Inverse of a Polynomial Function

So far, we have been able to find the inverse functions of cubic functions without having to restrict their domains.
However, as we know, not all cubic polynomials are one-to-one. Some functions that are not one-to-one may have their
domain restricted so that they are one-to-one, but only over that domain. The function over the restricted domain would
then have an inverse function. Since quadratic functions are not one-to-one, we must restrict their domain in order to
find their inverses.

To determine the intervals on which the rational expression is positive, we could test some values in the expression or

This function has two x-intercepts, both of which exhibit linear behavior near the x-intercepts. There is one vertical
asymptote, corresponding to a linear factor; this behavior is similar to the basic reciprocal toolkit function, and there is
no horizontal asymptote because the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. There is a

Finding Inverses of Rational Functions

As with finding inverses of quadratic functions, it is sometimes desirable to find the inverse of a rational function,
particularly of rational functions that are the ratio of linear functions, such as in concentration applications.

EXAMPLE 8

Finding the Inverse of a Rational Function

The function                     represents the concentration of an acid solution after mL of 40% solution has been added

to 100 mL of a 20% solution. First, find the inverse of the function; that is, find an expression for in terms of Then
use your result to determine how much of the 40% solution should be added so that the final mixture is a 35% solution.

     Solution
We first want the inverse of the function in order to determine how many mL we need for a given concentration. We will
solve for in terms of

Now evaluate this function at 35%, which is

We can conclude that 300 mL of the 40% solution should be added.

A pre-owned car dealer has just offered their best candidate, Nicole, a position in sales. The position offers 16%
commission on her sales. Her earnings depend on the amount of her sales. For instance, if she sells a vehicle for $4,600,
she will earn $736. As she considers the offer, she takes into account the typical price of the dealer's cars, the overall
market, and how many she can reasonably expect to sell. In this section, we will look at relationships, such as this one,
between earnings, sales, and commission rate.

Solving Direct Variation Problems

In the example above, Nicole's earnings can be found by multiplying her sales by her commission. The formula
tells us her earnings, come from the product of 0.16, her commission, and the sale price of the vehicle. If we create a
table, we observe that as the sales price increases, the earnings increase as well, which should be intuitive. See Table 1.

            , sales price                                                 Interpretation

            $4,600                                  A sale of a $4,600 vehicle results in $736 earnings.

            $9,200                                  A sale of a $9,200 vehicle results in $1472 earnings.

            $18,400                                 A sale of a $18,400 vehicle results in $2944 earnings.

    Table 1

Notice that earnings are a multiple of sales. As sales increase, earnings increase in a predictable way. Double the sales of
the vehicle from $4,600 to $9,200, and we double the earnings from $736 to $1,472. As the input increases, the output
increases as a multiple of the input. A relationship in which one quantity is a constant multiplied by another quantity is
called direct variation. Each variable in this type of relationship varies directly with the other.

Figure 1 represents the data for Nicole's potential earnings. We say that earnings vary directly with the sales price of the

car. The formula           is used for direct variation. The value is a nonzero constant greater than zero and is called

the constant of variation. In this case,  and       We saw functions like this one when we discussed power

Solving Inverse Variation Problems

Water temperature in an ocean varies inversely to the water's depth. The formula   gives us the temperature

in degrees Fahrenheit at a depth in feet below Earth's surface. Consider the Atlantic Ocean, which covers 22% of Earth's
surface. At a certain location, at the depth of 500 feet, the temperature may be 28°F.

If we create Table 2, we observe that, as the depth increases, the water temperature decreases.

           depth                                         Interpretation

           500 ft   At a depth of 500 ft, the water temperature is 28° F.

           1000 ft  At a depth of 1,000 ft, the water temperature is 14° F.

           2000 ft  At a depth of 2,000 ft, the water temperature is 7° F.

           Table 2

We notice in the relationship between these variables that, as one quantity increases, the other decreases. The two
quantities are said to be inversely proportional and each term varies inversely with the other. Inversely proportional
relationships are also called inverse variations.

For our example, Figure 3 depicts the inverse variation. We say the water temperature varies inversely with the depth of

the water because, as the depth increases, the temperature decreases. The formula  for inverse variation in this

case uses

Solution

Recall that multiplying speed by time gives distance. If we let represent the drive time in hours, and represent the

velocity (speed or rate) at which the tourist drives, then                Because the distance is fixed at 100 miles,

so           Because time is a function of velocity, we can write

We can see that the constant of variation is 100 and, although we can write the relationship using the negative exponent,
it is more common to see it written as a fraction. We say that time varies inversely with velocity.

Solving Problems Involving Joint Variation

Many situations are more complicated than a basic direct variation or inverse variation model. One variable often
depends on multiple other variables. When a variable is dependent on the product or quotient of two or more variables,
this is called joint variation. For example, the cost of busing students for each school trip varies with the number of
students attending and the distance from the school. The variable cost, varies jointly with the number of students,
and the distance,

Joint Variation

Joint variation occurs when a variable varies directly or inversely with multiple variables.

For instance, if varies directly with both and we have   If varies directly with and inversely with we

have        Notice that we only use one constant in a joint variation equation.

Key Concepts

5.1 Quadratic Functions

  · A polynomial function of degree two is called a quadratic function.
  · The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola. A parabola is a U-shaped curve that can open either up or down.
  · The axis of symmetry is the vertical line passing through the vertex. The zeros, or intercepts, are the points at

      which the parabola crosses the axis. The intercept is the point at which the parabola crosses the axis. See
      Example 1, Example 7, and Example 8.
  · Quadratic functions are often written in general form. Standard or vertex form is useful to easily identify the vertex
      of a parabola. Either form can be written from a graph. See Example 2.
  · The vertex can be found from an equation representing a quadratic function. See Example 3.
  · The domain of a quadratic function is all real numbers. The range varies with the function. See Example 4.
  · A quadratic function's minimum or maximum value is given by the value of the vertex.
  · The minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function can be used to determine the range of the function and to
      solve many kinds of real-world problems, including problems involving area and revenue. See Example 5 and
      Example 6.
  · The vertex and the intercepts can be identified and interpreted to solve real-world problems. See Example 9.

5.2 Power Functions and Polynomial Functions

· A power function is a variable base raised to a number power. See Example 1.

· The behavior of a graph as the input decreases beyond bound and increases beyond bound is called the end

behavior.

· The end behavior depends on whether the power is even or odd. See Example 2 and Example 3.

· A polynomial function is the sum of terms, each of which consists of a transformed power function with positive

whole number power. See Example 4.

· The degree of a polynomial function is the highest power of the variable that occurs in a polynomial. The term

containing the highest power of the variable is called the leading term. The coefficient of the leading term is called

the leading coefficient. See Example 5.

· The end behavior of a polynomial function is the same as the end behavior of the power function represented by

the leading term of the function. See Example 6 and Example 7.

· A polynomial of degree will have at most x-intercepts and at most            turning points. See Example 8, Example

9, Example 10, Example 11, and Example 12.

5.3 Graphs of Polynomial Functions

· Polynomial functions of degree 2 or more are smooth, continuous functions. See Example 1.

· To find the zeros of a polynomial function, if it can be factored, factor the function and set each factor equal to zero.

See Example 2, Example 3, and Example 4.

· Another way to find the intercepts of a polynomial function is to graph the function and identify the points at

which the graph crosses the axis. See Example 5.

· The multiplicity of a zero determines how the graph behaves at the intercepts. See Example 6.

· The graph of a polynomial will cross the horizontal axis at a zero with odd multiplicity.

· The graph of a polynomial will touch the horizontal axis at a zero with even multiplicity.

· The end behavior of a polynomial function depends on the leading term.

· The graph of a polynomial function changes direction at its turning points.

· A polynomial function of degree has at most      turning points. See Example 7.

· To graph polynomial functions, find the zeros and their multiplicities, determine the end behavior, and ensure that

the final graph has at most      turning points. See Example 8 and Example 10.

· Graphing a polynomial function helps to estimate local and global extremas. See Example 11.

· The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that if           have opposite signs, then there exists at least one

value between and for which                 See Example 9.

5.4 Dividing Polynomials

· Polynomial long division can be used to divide a polynomial by any polynomial with equal or lower degree. See

Example 1 and Example 2.

· The Division Algorithm tells us that a polynomial dividend can be written as the product of the divisor and the

quotient added to the remainder.

· Synthetic division is a shortcut that can be used to divide a polynomial by a binomial in the form    See Example

3, Example 4, and Example 5.

· Polynomial division can be used to solve application problems, including area and volume. See Example 6.

5.5 Zeros of Polynomial Functions

· To find  determine the remainder of the polynomial        when it is divided by             This is known as the

Remainder Theorem. See Example 1.

· According to the Factor Theorem, is a zero of    if and only if           is a factor of    See Example 2.

· According to the Rational Zero Theorem, each rational zero of a polynomial function with integer coefficients will be

equal to a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. See Example 3 and Example 4.

· When the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational zeros are the factors of the constant term.

· Synthetic division can be used to find the zeros of a polynomial function. See Example 5.

· According to the Fundamental Theorem, every polynomial function has at least one complex zero. See Example 6.

· Every polynomial function with degree greater than 0 has at least one complex zero.

· Allowing for multiplicities, a polynomial function will have the same number of factors as its degree. Each factor will

be in the form                   where is a complex number. See Example 7.

· The number of positive real zeros of a polynomial function is either the number of sign changes of the function or

less than the number of sign changes by an even integer.

· The number of negative real zeros of a polynomial function is either the number of sign changes of        or less

    than the number of sign changes by an even integer. See Example 8.
· Polynomial equations model many real-world scenarios. Solving the equations is easiest done by synthetic division.

    See Example 9.

5.6 Rational Functions

· We can use arrow notation to describe local behavior and end behavior of the toolkit functions              and

                 See Example 1.

· A function that levels off at a horizontal value has a horizontal asymptote. A function can have more than one

vertical asymptote. See Example 2.

· Application problems involving rates and concentrations often involve rational functions. See Example 3.

· The domain of a rational function includes all real numbers except those that cause the denominator to equal zero.

See Example 4.

· The vertical asymptotes of a rational function will occur where the denominator of the function is equal to zero and

the numerator is not zero. See Example 5.

· A removable discontinuity might occur in the graph of a rational function if an input causes both numerator and

denominator to be zero. See Example 6.

· A rational function's end behavior will mirror that of the ratio of the leading terms of the numerator and

denominator functions. See Example 7, Example 8, Example 9, and Example 10.

· Graph rational functions by finding the intercepts, behavior at the intercepts and asymptotes, and end behavior. See

Example 11.

· If a rational function has x-intercepts at                   vertical asymptotes at             and no

                 then the function can be written in the form

See Example 12.

5.7 Inverses and Radical Functions

· The inverse of a quadratic function is a square root function.

· If is the inverse of a function then is the inverse of the function  See Example 1.

· While it is not possible to find an inverse of most polynomial functions, some basic polynomials are invertible. See

Example 2.

· To find the inverse of certain functions, we must restrict the function to a domain on which it will be one-to-one. See

Example 3 and Example 4.

· When finding the inverse of a radical function, we need a restriction on the domain of the answer. See Example 5

and Example 7.

· Inverse and radical and functions can be used to solve application problems. See Example 6 and Example 8.

5.8 Modeling Using Variation

· A relationship where one quantity is a constant multiplied by another quantity is called direct variation. See Example
    1.

· Two variables that are directly proportional to one another will have a constant ratio.
· A relationship where one quantity is a constant divided by another quantity is called inverse variation. See Example

    2.
· Two variables that are inversely proportional to one another will have a constant multiple. See Example 3.
· In many problems, a variable varies directly or inversely with multiple variables. We call this type of relationship joint

    variation. See Example 4.

      Introduction to Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Focus in on a square centimeter of your skin. Look closer. Closer still. If you could look closely enough, you would see
hundreds of thousands of microscopic organisms. They are bacteria, and they are not only on your skin, but in your
mouth, nose, and even your intestines. In fact, the bacterial cells in your body at any given moment outnumber your
own cells. But that is no reason to feel bad about yourself. While some bacteria can cause illness, many are healthy and
even essential to the body.

Bacteria commonly reproduce through a process called binary fission, during which one bacterial cell splits into two.
When conditions are right, bacteria can reproduce very quickly. Unlike humans and other complex organisms, the time
required to form a new generation of bacteria is often a matter of minutes or hours, as opposed to days or years.1

For simplicity's sake, suppose we begin with a culture of one bacterial cell that can divide every hour. Table 1 shows the
number of bacterial cells at the end of each subsequent hour. We see that the single bacterial cell leads to over one
thousand bacterial cells in just ten hours! And if we were to extrapolate the table to twenty-four hours, we would have
over 16 million!

In this chapter, we will explore exponential functions, which can be used for, among other things, modeling growth
patterns such as those found in bacteria. We will also investigate logarithmic functions, which are closely related to
exponential functions. Both types of functions have numerous real-world applications when it comes to modeling and
interpreting data.

India is the second most populous country in the world with a population of about  billion people in 2021. The

population is growing at a rate of about  each year2 . If this rate continues, the population of India will exceed

China's population by the year     When populations grow rapidly, we often say that the growth is "exponential,"

meaning that something is growing very rapidly. To a mathematician, however, the term exponential growth has a very

specific meaning. In this section, we will take a look at exponential functions, which model this kind of rapid growth.

Identifying Exponential Functions

When exploring linear growth, we observed a constant rate of change--a constant number by which the output

increased for each unit increase in input. For example, in the equation            the slope tells us the output

increases by 3 each time the input increases by 1. The scenario in the India population example is different because we

have a percent change per unit time (rather than a constant change) in the number of people.

Defining an Exponential Function

A study found that the percent of the population who are vegans in the United States doubled from 2009 to 2011. In
2011, 2.5% of the population was vegan, adhering to a diet that does not include any animal products--no meat, poultry,
fish, dairy, or eggs. If this rate continues, vegans will make up 10% of the U.S. population in 2015, 40% in 2019, and 80%
in 2021.

What exactly does it mean to grow exponentially? What does the word double have in common with percent increase?
People toss these words around errantly. Are these words used correctly? The words certainly appear frequently in the
media.

· Percent change refers to a change based on a percent of the original amount.
· Exponential growth refers to an increase based on a constant multiplicative rate of change over equal increments

   of time, that is, a percent increase of the original amount over time.
· Exponential decay refers to a decrease based on a constant multiplicative rate of change over equal increments of

   time, that is, a percent decrease of the original amount over time.

For us to gain a clear understanding of exponential growth, let us contrast exponential growth with linear growth. We
will construct two functions. The first function is exponential. We will start with an input of 0, and increase each input by
1. We will double the corresponding consecutive outputs. The second function is linear. We will start with an input of 0,
and increase each input by 1. We will add 2 to the corresponding consecutive outputs. See Table 1.

                                               Table 1

From Table 1 we can infer that for these two functions, exponential growth dwarfs linear growth.

· Exponential growth refers to the original value from the range increases by the same percentage over equal
    increments found in the domain.

· Linear growth refers to the original value from the range increases by the same amount over equal increments
    found in the domain.

Apparently, the difference between "the same percentage" and "the same amount" is quite significant. For exponential
growth, over equal increments, the constant multiplicative rate of change resulted in doubling the output whenever the
input increased by one. For linear growth, the constant additive rate of change over equal increments resulted in adding
2 to the output whenever the input was increased by one.

The general form of the exponential function is             where is any nonzero number, is a positive real number
not equal to 1.

· If  the function grows at a rate proportional to its size.
· If        the function decays at a rate proportional to its size.

outputs over an interval in the domain from to

more precisely in a mathematical sense. If the growth rate is proportional to the amount present, the function models
exponential growth.

Exponential Growth

number and any positive real numbers and such that        an exponential growth function has the form

where

  · is the initial or starting value of the function.
  · is the growth factor or growth multiplier per unit .

In more general terms, we have an exponential function, in which a constant base is raised to a variable exponent. To
differentiate between linear and exponential functions, let's consider two companies, A and B. Company A has 100
stores and expands by opening 50 new stores a year, so its growth can be represented by the function

                            Company B has 100 stores and expands by increasing the number of stores by 50% each year, so its
growth can be represented by the function

A few years of growth for these companies are illustrated in Table 3.

that, with exponential growth, the number of stores increases much more rapidly than with linear growth.

Now we will turn our attention to the function representing the number of stores for Company B,                  where
In this exponential function, 100 represents the initial number of stores, 0.50 represents the growth rate, and

We let our independent variable be the number of years after 2006. Thus, the information given in the problem can be

short-term growth. As the inputs gets large, the output will get increasingly larger, so much so that the model may not

compound interest. The term compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the
accumulated value of the account.

The annual percentage rate (APR) of an account, also called the nominal rate, is the yearly interest rate earned by an
investment account. The term nominal is used when the compounding occurs a number of times other than once per
year. In fact, when interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective interest rate ends up being greater than
the nominal rate! This is a powerful tool for investing.

We can calculate the compound interest using the compound interest formula, which is an exponential function of the
variables time principal APR and number of compounding periods in a year

For example, observe Table 4, which shows the result of investing $1,000 at 10% for one year. Notice how the value of the
account increases as the compounding frequency increases.

                              Frequency Value after 1 year

                              Annually                       $1100

                              Semiannually                   $1102.50

                              Quarterly                      $1103.81

                              Monthly                        $1104.71

EXAMPLE 8

Calculating Compound Interest
If we invest $3,000 in an investment account paying 3% interest compounded quarterly, how much will the account be
worth in 10 years?

Solution

Because we are starting with $3,000,           Our interest rate is 3%, so              Because we are compounding

quarterly, we are compounding 4 times per year, so             We want to know the value of the account in 10 years, so we

are looking for  the value when

The account will be worth about $4,045.05 in 10 years.

TRY IT #8        An initial investment of $100,000 at 12% interest is compounded weekly (use 52 weeks in a year).
                 What will the investment be worth in 30 years?

EXAMPLE 9

Using the Compound Interest Formula to Solve for the Principal
A 529 Plan is a college-savings plan that allows relatives to invest money to pay for a child's future college tuition; the
account grows tax-free. Lily wants to set up a 529 account for her new granddaughter and wants the account to grow to
$40,000 over 18 years. She believes the account will earn 6% compounded semi-annually (twice a year). To the nearest
dollar, how much will Lily need to invest in the account now?

     Solution                                  Interest is compounded twice a year, so
The nominal interest rate is 6%, so

We want to find the initial investment, needed so that the value of the account will be worth $40,000 in  years.
Substitute the given values into the compound interest formula, and solve for

Lily will need to invest $13,801 to have $40,000 in 18 years.

TRY IT #9        Refer to Example 9. To the nearest dollar, how much would Lily need to invest if the account is
                 compounded quarterly?

Evaluating Functions with Base e

As we saw earlier, the amount earned on an account increases as the compounding frequency increases. Table 5 shows

that the increase from annual to semi-annual compounding is larger than the increase from monthly to daily
compounding. This might lead us to ask whether this pattern will continue.

Examine the value of $1 invested at 100% interest for 1 year, compounded at various frequencies, listed in Table 5.

Investigating Continuous Growth

So far we have worked with rational bases for exponential functions. For most real-world phenomena, however, e is used
as the base for exponential functions. Exponential models that use as the base are called continuous growth or decay
models. We see these models in finance, computer science, and most of the sciences, such as physics, toxicology, and
fluid dynamics.

  The Continuous Growth/Decay Formula

  For all real numbers and all positive numbers and continuous growth or decay is represented by the formula

where

    · is the initial value,
    · is the continuous growth rate per unit time,
    · and is the elapsed time.

If     , then the formula represents continuous growth. If  , then the formula represents continuous decay.

For business applications, the continuous growth formula is called the continuous compounding formula and takes
the form

where
  · is the principal or the initial invested,
  · is the growth or interest rate per unit time,
  · and is the period or term of the investment.

EXAMPLE 12

Calculating Continuous Decay
Radon-222 decays at a continuous rate of 17.3% per day. How much will 100 mg of Radon-222 decay to in 3 days?

Solution

Since the substance is decaying, the rate,      , is negative. So,                         The initial amount of radon-222 was

mg, so      We use the continuous decay formula to find the value after                    days:

So 59.5115 mg of radon-222 will remain.

As we discussed in the previous section, exponential functions are used for many real-world applications such as finance,
forensics, computer science, and most of the life sciences. Working with an equation that describes a real-world situation
gives us a method for making predictions. Most of the time, however, the equation itself is not enough. We learn a lot
about things by seeing their pictorial representations, and that is exactly why graphing exponential equations is a
powerful tool. It gives us another layer of insight for predicting future events.

output values in Table 1 change as the input increases by

                                 Table 1

Each output value is the product of the previous output and the base, We call the base the constant ratio. In fact, for

any exponential function with the form          is the constant ratio of the function. This means that as the input

increases by 1, the output value will be the product of the base and the previous output, regardless of the value of

Notice from the table that

· as decreases, the output values grow smaller, approaching zero.

Again, because the input is increasing by 1, each output value is the product of the previous output and the base, or

Graphing Transformations of Exponential Functions

Transformations of exponential graphs behave similarly to those of other functions. Just as with other parent functions,
we can apply the four types of transformations--shifts, reflections, stretches, and compressions--to the parent function

               without loss of shape. For instance, just as the quadratic function maintains its parabolic shape when shifted,
reflected, stretched, or compressed, the exponential function also maintains its general shape regardless of the
transformations applied.

Graphing a Vertical Shift

The first transformation occurs when we add a constant to the parent function         giving us a vertical shift

units in the same direction as the sign. For example, if we begin by graphing a parent function,  we can then

graph two vertical shifts alongside it, using  the upward shift,               and the downward shift,

        Both vertical shifts are shown in Figure 5.

                                                    Figure 5

Observe the results of shifting      vertically:

· The domain,   remains unchanged.

· When the function is shifted up units to
     The y-intercept shifts up units to
     The asymptote shifts up units to

    The range becomes 

· When the function is shifted down units to

 The y-intercept shifts down units to

 The asymptote also shifts down units to

 The range becomes               

Graphing a Horizontal Shift

The next transformation occurs when we add a constant to the input of the parent function         giving us a

horizontal shift units in the opposite direction of the sign. For example, if we begin by graphing the parent function

        we can then graph two horizontal shifts alongside it, using  the shift left,              and the shift

right,  Both horizontal shifts are shown in Figure 6.

                                                    Figure 6

Observe the results of shifting      horizontally:

· The domain,   remains unchanged.

· The asymptote,  remains unchanged.

· The y-intercept shifts such that:

 When the function is shifted left units to                the y-intercept becomes                This is because
                                                             the y-intercept becomes                  Again, see that
                  so the initial value of the function is

Graphing a Stretch or Compression

While horizontal and vertical shifts involve adding constants to the input or to the function itself, a stretch or

compression occurs when we multiply the parent function   by a constant                 For example, if we begin by

graphing the parent function   we can then graph the stretch, using           to get             as shown on

the left in Figure 8, and the compression, using  to get             as shown on the right in Figure 8.

Graphing Reflections

In addition to shifting, compressing, and stretching a graph, we can also reflect it about the x-axis or the y-axis. When we

multiply the parent function                   by we get a reflection about the x-axis. When we multiply the input by we

get a reflection about the y-axis. For example, if we begin by graphing the parent function         we can then graph

the two reflections alongside it. The reflection about the x-axis,               is shown on the left side of Figure 10, and

                   Figure 1 Devastation of March 11, 2011 earthquake in Honshu, Japan. (credit: Daniel Pierce)

In 2010, a major earthquake struck Haiti, destroying or damaging over 285,000 homes4 . One year later, another,
stronger earthquake devastated Honshu, Japan, destroying or damaging over 332,000 buildings,5 like those shown in
Figure 1. Even though both caused substantial damage, the earthquake in 2011 was 100 times stronger than the
earthquake in Haiti. How do we know? The magnitudes of earthquakes are measured on a scale known as the Richter
Scale. The Haitian earthquake registered a 7.0 on the Richter Scale6 whereas the Japanese earthquake registered a 9.0.7

The Richter Scale is a base-ten logarithmic scale. In other words, an earthquake of magnitude 8 is not twice as great as

an earthquake of magnitude 4. It is                    times as great! In this lesson, we will investigate the nature of

the Richter Scale and the base-ten function upon which it depends.

Converting from Logarithmic to Exponential Form

In order to analyze the magnitude of earthquakes or compare the magnitudes of two different earthquakes, we need to
be able to convert between logarithmic and exponential form. For example, suppose the amount of energy released

from one earthquake were 500 times greater than the amount of energy released from another. We want to calculate

the difference in magnitude. The equation that represents this problem is  where represents the difference

in magnitudes on the Richter Scale. How would we solve for

We have not yet learned a method for solving exponential equations. None of the algebraic tools discussed so far is

sufficient to solve    We know that                       and        so it is clear that must be some value between

2 and 3, since         is increasing. We can examine a graph, as in Figure 2, to better estimate the solution.

                                                          Figure 2

Estimating from a graph, however, is imprecise. To find an algebraic solution, we must introduce a new function.

Observe that the graph in Figure 2 passes the horizontal line test. The exponential function  is one-to-one, so its

inverse,        is also a function. As is the case with all inverse functions, we simply interchange and and solve for

to find the inverse function. To represent as a function of we use a logarithmic function of the form

The base logarithm of a number is the exponent by which we must raise to get that number.

We read a logarithmic expression as, "The logarithm with base of is equal to " or, simplified, "log base of is "

We can also say, " raised to the power of is " because logs are exponents. For example, the base 2 logarithm of 32

is 5, because 5 is the exponent we must apply to 2 to get 32. Since        we can write       We read this as "log

base 2 of 32 is 5."

We can express the relationship between logarithmic form and its corresponding exponential form as follows:

Note that the base is always positive.

Because logarithm is a function, it is most correctly written as     using parentheses to denote function evaluation,

just as we would with  However, when the input is a single variable or number, it is common to see the parentheses

dropped and the expression written without parentheses, as           Note that many calculators require parentheses

around the

We can illustrate the notation of logarithms as follows:

Notice that, comparing the logarithm function and the exponential function, the input and the output are switched. This

means             and                are inverse functions.

Definition of the Logarithmic Function

A logarithm base    of a positive number       satisfies the following definition.
For

where,

  · we read         as, "the logarithm with base of " or the "log base of

  · the logarithm is the exponent to which must be raised to get

Also, since the logarithmic and exponential functions switch the and values, the domain and range of the
exponential function are interchanged for the logarithmic function. Therefore,

  · the range of the logarithm function with base             

  Q&A        Can we take the logarithm of a negative number?

             No. Because the base of an exponential function is always positive, no power of that base can ever be
             negative. We can never take the logarithm of a negative number. Also, we cannot take the logarithm of
             zero. Calculators may output a log of a negative number when in complex mode, but the log of a negative
             number is not a real number.

Generally, when we look for ordered pairs for the graph of a function, we usually choose an x-value and then determine

its corresponding y-value. In this case you may find it easier to choose y-values and then determine its corresponding x-

value.

In Graphs of Exponential Functions, we saw how creating a graphical representation of an exponential model gives us
another layer of insight for predicting future events. How do logarithmic graphs give us insight into situations? Because
every logarithmic function is the inverse function of an exponential function, we can think of every output on a
logarithmic graph as the input for the corresponding inverse exponential equation. In other words, logarithms give the
cause for an effect.

To illustrate, suppose we invest               in an account that offers an annual interest rate of compounded

continuously. We already know that the balance in our account for any year can be found with the equation

But what if we wanted to know the year for any balance? We would need to create a corresponding new function by
interchanging the input and the output; thus we would need to create a logarithmic model for this situation. By
graphing the model, we can see the output (year) for any input (account balance). For instance, what if we wanted to
know how many years it would take for our initial investment to double? Figure 1 shows this point on the logarithmic
graph.

In this section we will discuss the values for which a logarithmic function is defined, and then turn our attention to
graphing the family of logarithmic functions.

Finding the Domain of a Logarithmic Function

Before working with graphs, we will take a look at the domain (the set of input values) for which the logarithmic function
is defined.

Recall that the exponential function is defined as  for any real number and constant            where

· The domain of is      
· The range of is      

In the last section we learned that the logarithmic function             is the inverse of the exponential function
So, as inverse functions:

· The domain of           is the range of                     

· The range of         is the domain of                       

Transformations of the parent function              behave similarly to those of other functions. Just as with other

parent functions, we can apply the four types of transformations--shifts, stretches, compressions, and reflections--to

the parent function without loss of shape.

In Graphs of Exponential Functions we saw that certain transformations can change the range of  Similarly,

applying transformations to the parent function               can change the domain. When finding the domain of a

logarithmic function, therefore, it is important to remember that the domain consists only of positive real numbers. That

is, the argument of the logarithmic function must be greater than zero.

For example, consider                       This function is defined for any values of such that the argument, in this

case  is greater than zero. To find the domain, we set up an inequality and solve for

In interval notation, the domain of                 is

Graphing Logarithmic Functions

Now that we have a feel for the set of values for which a logarithmic function is defined, we move on to graphing

logarithmic functions. The family of logarithmic functions includes the parent function                       along with all its

transformations: shifts, stretches, compressions, and reflections.

We begin with the parent function                          Because every logarithmic function of this form is the inverse of an

exponential function with the form                       their graphs will be reflections of each other across the line  To

illustrate this, we can observe the relationship between the input and output values of  and its equivalent

in Table 1.

     Yes, if we know the function is a general logarithmic function. For example, look at the graph in Figure 16.

     The graph approaches              (or thereabouts) more and more closely, so     is, or is very close to,

                     Figure 1 The pH of hydrochloric acid is tested with litmus paper. (credit: David Berardan)

In chemistry, pH is used as a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a substance. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14.
Substances with a pH less than 7 are considered acidic, and substances with a pH greater than 7 are said to be basic. Our
bodies, for instance, must maintain a pH close to 7.35 in order for enzymes to work properly. To get a feel for what is
acidic and what is basic, consider the following pH levels of some common substances:

  · Battery acid: 0.8
  · Stomach acid: 2.7
  · Orange juice: 3.3
  · Pure water: 7 (at 25° C)
  · Human blood: 7.35
  · Fresh coconut: 7.8
  · Sodium hydroxide (lye): 14

To determine whether a solution is acidic or basic, we find its pH, which is a measure of the number of active positive
hydrogen ions in the solution. The pH is defined by the following formula, where is the concentration of hydrogen
ion in the solution

Using the Product Rule for Logarithms

Recall that the logarithmic and exponential functions "undo" each other. This means that logarithms have similar
properties to exponents. Some important properties of logarithms are given here. First, the following properties are easy
to prove.

For example,       since             And         since

Next, we have the inverse property.

For example, to evaluate             we can rewrite the logarithm as   and then apply the inverse property
                   to get

To evaluate   we can rewrite the logarithm as    and then apply the inverse property  to get

Finally, we have the one-to-one property.

We can use the one-to-one property to solve the equation               for           Since the bases are the same,

we can apply the one-to-one property by setting the arguments equal and solving for

But what about the equation                               The one-to-one property does not help us in this instance.

Before we can solve an equation like this, we need a method for combining terms on the left side of the equation.

Recall that we use the product rule of exponents to combine the product of powers by adding exponents:
We have a similar property for logarithms, called the product rule for logarithms, which says that the logarithm of a
product is equal to a sum of logarithms. Because logs are exponents, and we multiply like bases, we can add the
exponents. We will use the inverse property to derive the product rule below.

Given any real number and positive real numbers           and where    we will show

Let           and            In exponential form, these equations are  and            It follows that

Note that repeated applications of the product rule for logarithms allow us to simplify the logarithm of the product of

any number of factors. For example, consider              Using the product rule for logarithms, we can rewrite this

logarithm of a product as the sum of logarithms of its factors:

The Product Rule for Logarithms

The product rule for logarithms can be used to simplify a logarithm of a product by rewriting it as a sum of
individual logarithms.

Using the Quotient Rule for Logarithms

For quotients, we have a similar rule for logarithms. Recall that we use the quotient rule of exponents to combine the

quotient of exponents by subtracting:  The quotient rule for logarithms says that the logarithm of a

quotient is equal to a difference of logarithms. Just as with the product rule, we can use the inverse property to derive
the quotient rule.

Given any real number and positive real numbers  and where                 we will show

Let  and                         In exponential form, these equations are        and     It follows that

For example, to expand                 we must first express the quotient in lowest terms. Factoring and canceling we
get,

Next we apply the quotient rule by subtracting the logarithm of the denominator from the logarithm of the numerator.
Then we apply the product rule.

      a power. For example,

product of a number and a logarithm can be written as a power. For the expression    we identify the factor, 4, as

Expanding Logarithmic Expressions

Taken together, the product rule, quotient rule, and power rule are often called "laws of logs." Sometimes we apply
more than one rule in order to simplify an expression. For example:

We can use the power rule to expand logarithmic expressions involving negative and fractional exponents. Here is an
alternate proof of the quotient rule for logarithms using the fact that a reciprocal is a negative power:

We can also apply the product rule to express a sum or difference of logarithms as the logarithm of a product.

With practice, we can look at a logarithmic expression and expand it mentally, writing the final answer. Remember,
however, that we can only do this with products, quotients, powers, and roots--never with addition or subtraction inside
the argument of the logarithm.

Objective 2: Solving Logarithmic Equations. (IA 10.3.4)

There are two types of logarithmic equations: those with log terms on just one side of the equation or those with log
terms on each side of the equation. Since the domain of logarithmic functions is positive numbers only, make sure to
check the solutions.

Type 1: Log terms on one side of the equation: Use properties of logs to rewrite a side with just one log term. Convert to
exponential notation and solve for x.

Figure 1 Wild rabbits in Australia. The rabbit population grew so quickly in Australia that the event became known as
the "rabbit plague." (credit: Richard Taylor, Flickr)

In 1859, an Australian landowner named Thomas Austin released 24 rabbits into the wild for hunting. Because Australia
had few predators and ample food, the rabbit population exploded. In fewer than ten years, the rabbit population
numbered in the millions.

Uncontrolled population growth, as in the wild rabbits in Australia, can be modeled with exponential functions.
Equations resulting from those exponential functions can be solved to analyze and make predictions about exponential
growth. In this section, we will learn techniques for solving exponential functions.

Using Like Bases to Solve Exponential Equations

The first technique involves two functions with like bases. Recall that the one-to-one property of exponential functions

tells us that, for any real numbers            and where                     if and only if

In other words, when an exponential equation has the same base on each side, the exponents must be equal. This also
applies when the exponents are algebraic expressions. Therefore, we can solve many exponential equations by using the
rules of exponents to rewrite each side as a power with the same base. Then, we use the fact that exponential functions
are one-to-one to set the exponents equal to one another, and solve for the unknown.

For example, consider the equation             To solve for we use the division property of exponents to rewrite

the right side so that both sides have the common base, Then we apply the one-to-one property of exponents by
setting the exponents equal to one another and solving for :

Sometimes the methods used to solve an equation introduce an extraneous solution, which is a solution that is correct
algebraically but does not satisfy the conditions of the original equation. One such situation arises in solving when the
logarithm is taken on both sides of the equation. In such cases, remember that the argument of the logarithm must be
positive. If the number we are evaluating in a logarithm function is negative, there is no output.

Analysis

When we plan to use factoring to solve a problem, we always get zero on one side of the equation, because zero has the

unique property that when a product is zero, one or both of the factors must be zero. We reject the equation

because a positive number never equals a negative number. The solution  is not a real number, and in the real

number system this solution is rejected as an extraneous solution.

Q&A          Does every logarithmic equation have a solution?

             No. Keep in mind that we can only apply the logarithm to a positive number. Always check for extraneous

Using the Definition of a Logarithm to Solve Logarithmic Equations

We have already seen that every logarithmic equation                is equivalent to the exponential equation  We

can use this fact, along with the rules of logarithms, to solve logarithmic equations where the argument is an algebraic

expression.

For example, consider the equation                    To solve this equation, we can use rules of logarithms

use the fact that logarithmic functions are one-to-one to set the arguments equal to one another and solve for the
unknown.

For example, consider the equation                               To solve this equation, we can use the rules of

logarithms to rewrite the left side as a single logarithm, and then apply the one-to-one property to solve for

     HOW TO

Given an equation containing logarithms, solve it using the one-to-one property.
 1. Use the rules of logarithms to combine like terms, if necessary, so that the resulting equation has the form

2. Use the one-to-one property to set the arguments equal.

3. Solve the resulting equation,          for the unknown.

Solving Applied Problems Using Exponential and Logarithmic Equations

In previous sections, we learned the properties and rules for both exponential and logarithmic functions. We have seen
that any exponential function can be written as a logarithmic function and vice versa. We have used exponents to solve
logarithmic equations and logarithms to solve exponential equations. We are now ready to combine our skills to solve
equations that model real-world situations, whether the unknown is in an exponent or in the argument of a logarithm.

One such application is in science, in calculating the time it takes for half of the unstable material in a sample of a
radioactive substance to decay, called its half-life. Table 1 lists the half-life for several of the more common radioactive
substances.

                                 Substance      Use                   Half-life

                                 Table 1

We can see how widely the half-lives for these substances vary. Knowing the half-life of a substance allows us to
calculate the amount remaining after a specified time. We can use the formula for radioactive decay:

where

·      is the amount initially present

· is the half-life of the substance

· is the time period over which the substance is studied

·      is the amount of the substance present after time

Exponential functions model many situations. If you have a savings account, you have experienced the use of an
exponential function. There are two formulas that are used to determine the balance in the account when interest is
earned. If a principal, P, is invested at an interest rate, r, for t years, the new balance, A, will depend on how often the
interest is compounded.

       we used for the growth of money. For growth and decay, generally we use as the original amount instead of calling
       it the principal. We see that exponential growth has a positive rate of growth and exponential decay has a negative
       rate of growth.

We have already explored some basic applications of exponential and logarithmic functions. In this section, we explore
some important applications in more depth, including radioactive isotopes and Newton's Law of Cooling.

Modeling Exponential Growth and Decay

In real-world applications, we need to model the behavior of a function. In mathematical modeling, we choose a familiar
general function with properties that suggest that it will model the real-world phenomenon we wish to analyze. In the
case of rapid growth, we may choose the exponential growth function:

where is equal to the value at time zero, is Euler's constant, and is a positive constant that determines the rate
(percentage) of growth. We may use the exponential growth function in applications involving doubling time, the time it
takes for a quantity to double. Such phenomena as wildlife populations, financial investments, biological samples, and
natural resources may exhibit growth based on a doubling time. In some applications, however, as we will see when we
discuss the logistic equation, the logistic model sometimes fits the data better than the exponential model.

On the other hand, if a quantity is falling rapidly toward zero, without ever reaching zero, then we should probably

choose the exponential decay model. Again, we have the form                 where is the starting value, and is

Euler's constant. Now is a negative constant that determines the rate of decay. We may use the exponential decay

model when we are calculating half-life, or the time it takes for a substance to exponentially decay to half of its original

quantity. We use half-life in applications involving radioactive isotopes.

In our choice of a function to serve as a mathematical model, we often use data points gathered by careful observation
and measurement to construct points on a graph and hope we can recognize the shape of the graph. Exponential
growth and decay graphs have a distinctive shape, as we can see in Figure 2 and Figure 3. It is important to remember
that, although parts of each of the two graphs seem to lie on the x-axis, they are really a tiny distance above the x-axis.

Exponential growth and decay often involve very large or very small numbers. To describe these numbers, we often use

orders of magnitude. The order of magnitude is the power of ten, when the number is expressed in scientific notation,

with one digit to the left of the decimal. For example, the distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, measured in

kilometers, is 40,113,497,200,000 kilometers. Expressed in scientific notation, this is               So, we could

describe this number as having order of magnitude

    The population of bacteria after twenty hours is 10,485,760 which is of the order of magnitude  so we could say
744 6 · Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

       that the population has increased by three orders of magnitude in ten hours.

      Half-Life

       We now turn to exponential decay. One of the common terms associated with exponential decay, as stated above, is
       half-life, the length of time it takes an exponentially decaying quantity to decrease to half its original amount. Every
       radioactive isotope has a half-life, and the process describing the exponential decay of an isotope is called radioactive
       decay.
       To find the half-life of a function describing exponential decay, solve the following equation:

We find that the half-life depends only on the constant  and not on the starting quantity
The formula is derived as follows

Since the time, is positive, must, as expected, be negative. This gives us the half-life formula

              plutonium-244 remaining as a function of time, measured in years.

Radiocarbon Dating

The formula for radioactive decay is important in radiocarbon dating, which is used to calculate the approximate date a
plant or animal died. Radiocarbon dating was discovered in 1949 by Willard Libby, who won a Nobel Prize for his
discovery. It compares the difference between the ratio of two isotopes of carbon in an organic artifact or fossil to the
ratio of those two isotopes in the air. It is believed to be accurate to within about 1% error for plants or animals that died
within the last 60,000 years.

Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that has a half-life of 5,730 years. It occurs in small quantities in the carbon
dioxide in the air we breathe. Most of the carbon on Earth is carbon-12, which has an atomic weight of 12 and is not
radioactive. Scientists have determined the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the air for the last 60,000 years, using tree
rings and other organic samples of known dates--although the ratio has changed slightly over the centuries.

As long as a plant or animal is alive, the ratio of the two isotopes of carbon in its body is close to the ratio in the
atmosphere. When it dies, the carbon-14 in its body decays and is not replaced. By comparing the ratio of carbon-14 to
carbon-12 in a decaying sample to the known ratio in the atmosphere, the date the plant or animal died can be
approximated.

Since the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years, the formula for the amount of carbon-14 remaining after years is

where

· is the amount of carbon-14 remaining

·      is the amount of carbon-14 when the plant or animal began decaying.

This formula is derived as follows:

To find the age of an object, we solve this equation for

Out of necessity, we neglect here the many details that a scientist takes into consideration when doing carbon-14 dating,

and we only look at the basic formula. The ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere is approximately

0.0000000001%. Let be the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the organic artifact or fossil to be dated, determined by a

method called liquid scintillation. From the equation     we know the ratio of the percentage of

carbon-14 in the object we are dating to the initial amount of carbon-14 in the object when it was formed is

              We solve this equation for to get

...

     HOW TO

Given the percentage of carbon-14 in an object, determine its age.

1. Express the given percentage of carbon-14 as an equivalent decimal,

2. Substitute for k in the equation            and solve for the age,

     Analysis
The instruments that measure the percentage of carbon-14 are extremely sensitive and, as we mention above, a scientist
will need to do much more work than we did in order to be satisfied. Even so, carbon dating is only accurate to about 1%,
so this age should be given as

               more or less than 230 years until only 1 milligram remains?

Calculating Doubling Time

For decaying quantities, we determined how long it took for half of a substance to decay. For growing quantities, we
might want to find out how long it takes for a quantity to double. As we mentioned above, the time it takes for a quantity
to double is called the doubling time.

Given the basic exponential growth equation    doubling time can be found by solving for when the original
quantity has doubled, that is, by solving

The formula is derived as follows:

Thus the doubling time is

     Solution
The formula is derived as follows:

The function is

TRY IT #3        Recent data suggests that, as of 2013, the rate of growth predicted by Moore's Law no longer
                 holds. Growth has slowed to a doubling time of approximately three years. Find the new function
                 that takes that longer doubling time into account.

Using Newton's Law of Cooling

Exponential decay can also be applied to temperature. When a hot object is left in surrounding air that is at a lower
temperature, the object's temperature will decrease exponentially, leveling off as it approaches the surrounding air
temperature. On a graph of the temperature function, the leveling off will correspond to a horizontal asymptote at the
temperature of the surrounding air. Unless the room temperature is zero, this will correspond to a vertical shift of the
generic exponential decay function. This translation leads to Newton's Law of Cooling, the scientific formula for
temperature as a function of time as an object's temperature is equalized with the ambient temperature

This formula is derived as follows:

Newton's Law of Cooling
The temperature of an object, in surrounding air with temperature will behave according to the formula

where

  · is time
  · is the difference between the initial temperature of the object and the surroundings
  · is a constant, the continuous rate of cooling of the object

     HOW TO

Given a set of conditions, apply Newton's Law of Cooling.

1. Set equal to the y-coordinate of the horizontal asymptote (usually the ambient temperature).

2. Substitute the given values into the continuous growth formula  to find the parameters and

3. Substitute in the desired time to find the temperature or the desired temperature to find the time.

exponentially toward 35, following the equation

We know the initial temperature was 165, so

We were given another data point,               which we can use to solve for

This gives us the equation for the cooling of the cheesecake:

Using Logistic Growth Models

Exponential growth cannot continue forever. Exponential models, while they may be useful in the short term, tend to fall
apart the longer they continue. Consider an aspiring writer who writes a single line on day one and plans to double the
number of lines she writes each day for a month. By the end of the month, she must write over 17 billion lines, or one-
half-billion pages. It is impractical, if not impossible, for anyone to write that much in such a short period of time.
Eventually, an exponential model must begin to approach some limiting value, and then the growth is forced to slow. For
this reason, it is often better to use a model with an upper bound instead of an exponential growth model, though the
exponential growth model is still useful over a short term, before approaching the limiting value.

The logistic growth model is approximately exponential at first, but it has a reduced rate of growth as the output

approaches the model's upper bound, called the carrying capacity. For constants        and the logistic growth of a

population over time is represented by the model

The graph in Figure 6 shows how the growth rate changes over time. The graph increases from left to right, but the
growth rate only increases until it reaches its point of maximum growth rate, at which point the rate of increase
decreases.

where

    ·  is the initial value

    · is the carrying capacity, or limiting value

EXAMPLE 6

Using the Logistic-Growth Model
An influenza epidemic spreads through a population rapidly, at a rate that depends on two factors: The more people
who have the flu, the more rapidly it spreads, and also the more uninfected people there are, the more rapidly it
spreads. These two factors make the logistic model a good one to study the spread of communicable diseases. And,
clearly, there is a maximum value for the number of people infected: the entire population.

For example, at time  there is one person in a community of 1,000 people who has the flu. So, in that community, at

most 1,000 people can have the flu. Researchers find that for this particular strain of the flu, the logistic growth constant

is         Estimate the number of people in this community who will have had this flu after ten days. Predict how

many people in this community will have had this flu after a long period of time has passed.

     Solution
We substitute the given data into the logistic growth model

Because at most 1,000 people, the entire population of the community, can get the flu, we know the limiting value is

       To find we use the formula that the number of cases at time  is  from which it follows that

       This model predicts that, after ten days, the number of people who have had the flu is
                                       Because the actual number must be a whole number (a person has either had the flu or
750 6 · Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

       not) we round to 294. In the long term, the number of people who will contract the flu is the limiting value,

       Remember that, because we are dealing with a virus, we cannot predict with certainty the number of people infected.
       The model only approximates the number of people infected and will not give us exact or actual values.

     Choosing an Appropriate Model for Data

       Now that we have discussed various mathematical models, we need to learn how to choose the appropriate model for
       the raw data we have. Many factors influence the choice of a mathematical model, among which are experience,
       scientific laws, and patterns in the data itself. Not all data can be described by elementary functions. Sometimes, a
       function is chosen that approximates the data over a given interval. For instance, suppose data were gathered on the
       number of homes bought in the United States from the years 1960 to 2013. After plotting these data in a scatter plot, we
       notice that the shape of the data from the years 2000 to 2013 follow a logarithmic curve. We could restrict the interval
       from 2000 to 2010, apply regression analysis using a logarithmic model, and use it to predict the number of home buyers
       for the year 2015.
       Three kinds of functions that are often useful in mathematical models are linear functions, exponential functions, and
       logarithmic functions. If the data lies on a straight line, or seems to lie approximately along a straight line, a linear model
       may be best. If the data is non-linear, we often consider an exponential or logarithmic model, though other models, such
       as quadratic models, may also be considered.
       In choosing between an exponential model and a logarithmic model, we look at the way the data curves. This is called
       the concavity. If we draw a line between two data points, and all (or most) of the data between those two points lies
       above that line, we say the curve is concave down. We can think of it as a bowl that bends downward and therefore
       cannot hold water. If all (or most) of the data between those two points lies below the line, we say the curve is concave
       up. In this case, we can think of a bowl that bends upward and can therefore hold water. An exponential curve, whether
       rising or falling, whether representing growth or decay, is always concave up away from its horizontal asymptote. A
       logarithmic curve is always concave away from its vertical asymptote. In the case of positive data, which is the most
       common case, an exponential curve is always concave up, and a logarithmic curve always concave down.
       A logistic curve changes concavity. It starts out concave up and then changes to concave down beyond a certain point,

called a point of inflection.
After using the graph to help us choose a type of function to use as a model, we substitute points, and solve to find the
parameters. We reduce round-off error by choosing points as far apart as possible.

Clearly, the points do not lie on a straight line, so we reject a linear model. If we draw a line between any two of the

points, most or all of the points between those two points lie above the line, so the graph is concave down, suggesting a

logarithmic model. We can try      Plugging in the first point,       gives     We reject the case that

Plotting this data, as depicted below, suggests that there may be a trend. We can see from the trend in the data that
the number of chirps increases as the temperature increases. The trend appears to be roughly linear, though certainly
not perfectly so.

We can find a linear function that fits the data in the previous problem by "eyeballing" a line that seems to fit. But while
estimating a line works relatively well, technology can help us find a line that fits the data as perfect as possible.

A regression line is a line that is closest to the data in the scatter plot, which means that such a line is a best fit for the

In previous sections of this chapter, we were either given a function explicitly to graph or evaluate, or we were given a
set of points that were guaranteed to lie on the curve. Then we used algebra to find the equation that fit the points
exactly. In this section, we use a modeling technique called regression analysis to find a curve that models data collected
from real-world observations. With regression analysis, we don't expect all the points to lie perfectly on the curve. The
idea is to find a model that best fits the data. Then we use the model to make predictions about future events.

Do not be confused by the word model. In mathematics, we often use the terms function, equation, and model
interchangeably, even though they each have their own formal definition. The term model is typically used to indicate
that the equation or function approximates a real-world situation.

We will concentrate on three types of regression models in this section: exponential, logarithmic, and logistic. Having
764 6 · Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

already worked with each of these functions gives us an advantage. Knowing their formal definitions, the behavior of
their graphs, and some of their real-world applications gives us the opportunity to deepen our understanding. As each
regression model is presented, key features and definitions of its associated function are included for review. Take a
moment to rethink each of these functions, reflect on the work we've done so far, and then explore the ways regression
is used to model real-world phenomena.

Building an Exponential Model from Data

As we've learned, there are a multitude of situations that can be modeled by exponential functions, such as investment
growth, radioactive decay, atmospheric pressure changes, and temperatures of a cooling object. What do these
phenomena have in common? For one thing, all the models either increase or decrease as time moves forward. But
that's not the whole story. It's the way data increase or decrease that helps us determine whether it is best modeled by
an exponential equation. Knowing the behavior of exponential functions in general allows us to recognize when to use
exponential regression, so let's review exponential growth and decay.

Recall that exponential functions have the form    or           When performing regression analysis, we use the

form most commonly used on graphing utilities,            Take a moment to reflect on the characteristics we've already

learned about the exponential function           (assume

· must be greater than zero and not equal to one.

· The initial value of the model is

 If         the function models exponential growth. As increases, the outputs of the model increase slowly at

first, but then increase more and more rapidly, without bound.

 If         the function models exponential decay. As increases, the outputs for the model decrease rapidly

at first and then level off to become asymptotic to the x-axis. In other words, the outputs never become equal to

or less than zero.

As part of the results, your calculator will display a number known as the correlation coefficient, labeled by the variable
or (You may have to change the calculator's settings for these to be shown.) The values are an indication of the
"goodness of fit" of the regression equation to the data. We more commonly use the value of instead of but the
closer either value is to 1, the better the regression equation approximates the data.

Exponential Regression

Exponential regression is used to model situations in which growth begins slowly and then accelerates rapidly
without bound, or where decay begins rapidly and then slows down to get closer and closer to zero. We use the
command "ExpReg" on a graphing utility to fit an exponential function to a set of data points. This returns an
equation of the form,

Note that:

· must be non-negative.

· when      we have an exponential growth model.

· when      we have an exponential decay model.

  EXAMPLE 1

Using Exponential Regression to Fit a Model to Data
In 2007, a university study was published investigating the crash risk of alcohol impaired driving. Data from 2,871
crashes were used to measure the association of a person's blood alcohol level (BAC) with the risk of being in an
accident. Table 1 shows results from the study 10 . The relative risk is a measure of how many times more likely a person
is to crash. So, for example, a person with a BAC of 0.09 is 3.54 times as likely to crash as a person who has not been
drinking alcohol.

                      BAC  0 0.01 0.03 0.05 0.07 0.09

Q&A  Is it reasonable to assume that an exponential regression model will represent a situation
     indefinitely?

     No. Remember that models are formed by real-world data gathered for regression. It is usually
     reasonable to make estimates within the interval of original observation (interpolation). However, when a

             model is used to make predictions, it is important to use reasoning skills to determine whether the model
             makes sense for inputs far beyond the original observation interval (extrapolation).

Building a Logarithmic Model from Data

Just as with exponential functions, there are many real-world applications for logarithmic functions: intensity of sound,
pH levels of solutions, yields of chemical reactions, production of goods, and growth of infants. As with exponential
models, data modeled by logarithmic functions are either always increasing or always decreasing as time moves
forward. Again, it is the way they increase or decrease that helps us determine whether a logarithmic model is best.

Recall that logarithmic functions increase or decrease rapidly at first, but then steadily slow as time moves on. By

reflecting on the characteristics we've already learned about this function, we can better analyze real world situations

that reflect this type of growth or decay. When performing logarithmic regression analysis, we use the form of the

logarithmic function most commonly used on graphing utilities,  For this function

· All input values, must be greater than zero.

· The point  is on the graph of the model.

· If       the model is increasing. Growth increases rapidly at first and then steadily slows over time.

· If       the model is decreasing. Decay occurs rapidly at first and then steadily slows over time.

Logarithmic Regression

Logarithmic regression is used to model situations where growth or decay accelerates rapidly at first and then slows
over time. We use the command "LnReg" on a graphing utility to fit a logarithmic function to a set of data points. This
returns an equation of the form,

Note that

· all input values, must be non-negative.

· when       the model is increasing.

· when       the model is decreasing.

Building a Logistic Model from Data

Like exponential and logarithmic growth, logistic growth increases over time. One of the most notable differences with
logistic growth models is that, at a certain point, growth steadily slows and the function approaches an upper bound, or
limiting value. Because of this, logistic regression is best for modeling phenomena where there are limits in expansion,
such as availability of living space or nutrients.

It is worth pointing out that logistic functions actually model resource-limited exponential growth. There are many
examples of this type of growth in real-world situations, including population growth and spread of disease, rumors, and
even stains in fabric. When performing logistic regression analysis, we use the form most commonly used on graphing
utilities:

Recall that:

·  is the initial value of the model.

· when        the model increases rapidly at first until it reaches its point of maximum growth rate,     At

    that point, growth steadily slows and the function becomes asymptotic to the upper bound
· is the limiting value, sometimes called the carrying capacity, of the model.

Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used to model situations where growth accelerates rapidly at first and then steadily slows to an
upper limit. We use the command "Logistic" on a graphing utility to fit a logistic function to a set of data points. This
returns an equation of the form

Note that                                                  as time increases.

            Solution

     Using the STAT then EDIT menu on a graphing utility, list the years using values 0-15 in L1 and the corresponding

       percentage in L2. Then use the STATPLOT feature to verify that the scatterplot follows a logistic pattern as shown in
       Figure 5:

                                                                                     Figure 5
       Use the "Logistic" command from the STAT then CALC menu to obtain the logistic model,
       Next, graph the model in the same window as shown in Figure 6 the scatterplot to verify it is a good fit:

                                                                              Figure 6         for the in the model

and solve for

According to the model, about 99.3% of Americans had cellular service in 2013.



The model gives a limiting value of about 105. This means that the maximum possible percentage of Americans with

cellular service would be 105%, which is impossible. (How could over 100% of a population have cellular service?) If the

model were exact, the limiting value would be  and the model's outputs would get very close to, but never

actually reach 100%. After all, there will always be someone out there without cellular service!

· We can solve many exponential equations by using the rules of exponents to rewrite each side as a power with the
    same base. Then we use the fact that exponential functions are one-to-one to set the exponents equal to one
    another and solve for the unknown.

· When we are given an exponential equation where the bases are explicitly shown as being equal, set the exponents
    equal to one another and solve for the unknown. See Example 1.

· When we are given an exponential equation where the bases are not explicitly shown as being equal, rewrite each
    side of the equation as powers of the same base, then set the exponents equal to one another and solve for the
    unknown. See Example 2, Example 3, and Example 4.

· When an exponential equation cannot be rewritten with a common base, solve by taking the logarithm of each side.
    See Example 5.

· We can solve exponential equations with base by applying the natural logarithm of both sides because
    exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses of each other. See Example 6 and Example 7.

784 6 · Chapter Review

extraneous solutions. See Example 8.

· When given an equation of the form                 where and are algebraic expressions, we can use the one-

to-one property of logarithms to solve the equation          for the unknown. See Example 12.

· Combining the skills learned in this and previous sections, we can solve equations that model real world situations,

whether the unknown is in an exponent or in the argument of a logarithm. See Example 13.

6.7 Exponential and Logarithmic Models

· The basic exponential function is       If         we have exponential growth; if            we have

exponential decay.

· We can also write this formula in terms of continuous growth as         where is the starting value. If is

positive, then we have exponential growth when       and exponential decay when       See Example 1.

· In general, we solve problems involving exponential growth or decay in two steps. First, we set up a model and use

the model to find the parameters. Then we use the formula with these parameters to predict growth and decay. See

Example 2.

· We can find the age, of an organic artifact by measuring the amount, of carbon-14 remaining in the artifact and

using the formula                to solve for See Example 3.

decay. See Example 4.

· We can use Newton's Law of Cooling to find how long it will take for a cooling object to reach a desired

temperature, or to find what temperature an object will be after a given time. See Example 5.

· We can use logistic growth functions to model real-world situations where the rate of growth changes over time,

such as population growth, spread of disease, and spread of rumors. See Example 6.

· We can use real-world data gathered over time to observe trends. Knowledge of linear, exponential, logarithmic,

and logistic graphs help us to develop models that best fit our data. See Example 7.

· Any exponential function with the form             can be rewritten as an equivalent exponential function with the

form                    where        See Example 8.

6.8 Fitting Exponential Models to Data

· Exponential regression is used to model situations where growth begins slowly and then accelerates rapidly without

bound, or where decay begins rapidly and then slows down to get closer and closer to zero.

· We use the command "ExpReg" on a graphing utility to fit function of the form       to a set of data points. See

Example 1.

· Logarithmic regression is used to model situations where growth or decay accelerates rapidly at first and then slows

over time.

points. See Example 2.

7  SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES

Enigma machines like this one were used by government and military officials for enciphering and deciphering top-
secret communications during World War II. By varying the combinations of the plugboard and the settings of the
rotors, encoders could add complex encryption to their messages. Notice that the three rotors each contain 26 pins, one
for each letter of the alphabet; later versions had four and five rotors. (credit: modification of "Enigma Machine" by

      Introduction to Systems of Equations and Inequalities

At the start of the Second World War, British military and intelligence officers recognized that defeating Nazi Germany
would require the Allies to know what the enemy was planning. This task was complicated by the fact that the German
military transmitted all of its communications through a presumably uncrackable code created by a machine called
Enigma. The Germans had been encoding their messages with this machine since the early 1930s, and were so confident
in its security that they used it for everyday military communications as well as highly important strategic messages.
Concerned about the increasing military threat, other European nations began working to decipher the Enigma codes.
Poland was the first country to make significant advances when it trained and recruited a new group of codebreakers:
math students from Pozna University. With the help of intelligence obtained by French spies, Polish mathematicians,
led by Marian Rejewski, were able to decipher initial codes and later to understand the wiring of the machines;
eventually they create replicas. However, the German military eventually increased the complexity of the machines by
adding additional rotors, requiring a new method of decryption.

The machine attached letters on a keyboard to three, four, or five rotors (depending on the version), each with 26
starting positions that could be set prior to encoding; a decryption code (called a cipher key) essentially conveyed these
settings to the message recipient, and allowed people to interpret the message using another Enigma machine. Even
with the simpler three-rotor scrambler, there were 17,576 different combinations of starting positions (26 x 26 x 26); plus
the machine had numerous other methods of introducing variation. Not long after the war started, the British recruited
a team of brilliant codebreakers to crack the Enigma code. The codebreakers, led by Alan Turing, used what they knew
796 7 · Systems of Equations and Inequalities

       about the Enigma machine to build a mechanical computer that could crack the code. And that knowledge of what the

       The Enigma is perhaps the most famous cryptographic device ever known. It stands as an example of the pivotal role
       cryptography has played in society. Now, technology has moved cryptanalysis to the digital world.

       Many ciphers are designed using invertible matrices as the method of message transference, as finding the inverse of a
       matrix is generally part of the process of decoding. In addition to knowing the matrix and its inverse, the receiver must
       also know the key that, when used with the matrix inverse, will allow the message to be read.

       In this chapter, we will investigate matrices and their inverses, and various ways to use matrices to solve systems of
       equations. First, however, we will study systems of equations on their own: linear and nonlinear, and then partial
       fractions. We will not be breaking any secret codes here, but we will lay the foundation for future courses.

A skateboard manufacturer introduces a new line of boards. The manufacturer tracks its costs, which is the amount it
spends to produce the boards, and its revenue, which is the amount it earns through sales of its boards. How can the
company determine if it is making a profit with its new line? How many skateboards must be produced and sold before a
profit is possible? In this section, we will consider linear equations with two variables to answer these and similar
questions.

Introduction to Systems of Equations

In order to investigate situations such as that of the skateboard manufacturer, we need to recognize that we are dealing
with more than one variable and likely more than one equation. A system of linear equations consists of two or more
linear equations made up of two or more variables such that all equations in the system are considered simultaneously.
To find the unique solution to a system of linear equations, we must find a numerical value for each variable in the
system that will satisfy all equations in the system at the same time. Some linear systems may not have a solution and
others may have an infinite number of solutions. In order for a linear system to have a unique solution, there must be at
least as many equations as there are variables. Even so, this does not guarantee a unique solution.

In this section, we will look at systems of linear equations in two variables, which consist of two equations that contain
two different variables. For example, consider the following system of linear equations in two variables.

The solution to a system of linear equations in two variables is any ordered pair that satisfies each equation
independently. In this example, the ordered pair (4, 7) is the solution to the system of linear equations. We can verify the
solution by substituting the values into each equation to see if the ordered pair satisfies both equations. Shortly we will
investigate methods of finding such a solution if it exists.

In addition to considering the number of equations and variables, we can categorize systems of linear equations by the
number of solutions. A consistent system of equations has at least one solution. A consistent system is considered to
be an independent system if it has a single solution, such as the example we just explored. The two lines have different
slopes and intersect at one point in the plane. A consistent system is considered to be a dependent system if the
equations have the same slope and the same y-intercepts. In other words, the lines coincide so the equations represent
the same line. Every point on the line represents a coordinate pair that satisfies the system. Thus, there are an infinite
number of solutions.

Another type of system of linear equations is an inconsistent system, which is one in which the equations represent
two parallel lines. The lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts. There are no points common to both lines;
hence, there is no solution to the system.

Types of Linear Systems

There are three types of systems of linear equations in two variables, and three types of solutions.

· An independent system has exactly one solution pair  The point where the two lines intersect is the only

solution.

· An inconsistent system has no solution. Notice that the two lines are parallel and will never intersect.
802 7 · Systems of Equations and Inequalities

           · A dependent system has infinitely many solutions. The lines are coincident. They are the same line, so every
                coordinate pair on the line is a solution to both equations.

         Figure 2 compares graphical representations of each type of system.

                                                                            Figure 2

           ...

              HOW TO

Given a system of linear equations and an ordered pair, determine whether the ordered pair is a solution.
 1. Substitute the ordered pair into each equation in the system.
 2. Determine whether true statements result from the substitution in both equations; if so, the ordered pair is a

      solution.

Determine whether the ordered pair  is a solution to the given system of equations.

Substitute the ordered pair

The ordered pair  satisfies both equations, so it is the solution to the system.

     Analysis
We can see the solution clearly by plotting the graph of each equation. Since the solution is an ordered pair that satisfies
both equations, it is a point on both of the lines and thus the point of intersection of the two lines. See Figure 3.

Solving Systems of Equations by Graphing

There are multiple methods of solving systems of linear equations. For a system of linear equations in two variables, we
can determine both the type of system and the solution by graphing the system of equations on the same set of axes.

       substituting the ordered pair into both equations.

The solution to the system is the ordered pair             so the system is independent.

TRY IT #3 Solve the following system of equations by graphing.

Q&A  Can graphing be used if the system is inconsistent or dependent?

     Yes, in both cases we can still graph the system to determine the type of system and solution. If the two
     lines are parallel, the system has no solution and is inconsistent. If the two lines are identical, the system
     has infinite solutions and is a dependent system.

Solving Systems of Equations by Substitution

Solving a linear system in two variables by graphing works well when the solution consists of integer values, but if our
solution contains decimals or fractions, it is not the most precise method. We will consider two more methods of solving
a system of linear equations that are more precise than graphing. One such method is solving a system of equations by
the substitution method, in which we solve one of the equations for one variable and then substitute the result into the
second equation to solve for the second variable. Recall that we can solve for only one variable at a time, which is the
reason the substitution method is both valuable and practical.

             ...

                 HOW TO

Given a system of two equations in two variables, solve using the substitution method.

 1. Solve one of the two equations for one of the variables in terms of the other.
 2. Substitute the expression for this variable into the second equation, then solve for the remaining variable.
 3. Substitute that solution into either of the original equations to find the value of the first variable. If possible,

      write the solution as an ordered pair.
 4. Check the solution in both equations.

Q&A  Can the substitution method be used to solve any linear system in two variables?

     Yes, but the method works best if one of the equations contains a coefficient of 1 or -1 so that we do not
     have to deal with fractions.

Solving Systems of Equations in Two Variables by the Addition Method

A third method of solving systems of linear equations is the addition method. In this method, we add two terms with
the same variable, but opposite coefficients, so that the sum is zero. Of course, not all systems are set up with the two
terms of one variable having opposite coefficients. Often we must adjust one or both of the equations by multiplication
so that one variable will be eliminated by addition.

             ...

                 HOW TO

Given a system of equations, solve using the addition method.

 1. Write both equations with x- and y-variables on the left side of the equal sign and constants on the right.
 2. Write one equation above the other, lining up corresponding variables. If one of the variables in the top equation

      has the opposite coefficient of the same variable in the bottom equation, add the equations together, eliminating
      one variable. If not, use multiplication by a nonzero number so that one of the variables in the top equation has
      the opposite coefficient of the same variable in the bottom equation, then add the equations to eliminate the
      variable.
 3. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.
 4. Substitute that value into one of the original equations and solve for the second variable.
 5. Check the solution by substituting the values into the other equation.

806 7 · Systems of Equations and Inequalities

            Solution
       Both equations are already set equal to a constant. Notice that the coefficient of in the second equation, -1, is the
       opposite of the coefficient of in the first equation, 1. We can add the two equations to eliminate without needing to
       multiply by a constant.

       Now that we have eliminated we can solve the resulting equation for

       Then, we substitute this value for into one of the original equations and solve for

       The solution to this system is
       Check the solution in the first equation.

            Analysis
       We gain an important perspective on systems of equations by looking at the graphical representation. See Figure 5 to
       find that the equations intersect at the solution. We do not need to ask whether there may be a second solution because
       observing the graph confirms that the system has exactly one solution.

Identifying Inconsistent Systems of Equations Containing Two Variables

Now that we have several methods for solving systems of equations, we can use the methods to identify inconsistent
systems. Recall that an inconsistent system consists of parallel lines that have the same slope but different -intercepts.
They will never intersect. When searching for a solution to an inconsistent system, we will come up with a false
statement, such as

We can approach this problem in two ways. Because one equation is already solved for
substitution.

Clearly, this statement is a contradiction because  Therefore, the system has no solution.

The second approach would be to first manipulate the equations so that they are both in slope-intercept form. We
manipulate the first equation as follows.

We then convert the second equation expressed to slope-intercept form.

Comparing the equations, we see that they have the same slope but different y-intercepts. Therefore, the lines are
parallel and do not intersect.

     Analysis
Writing the equations in slope-intercept form confirms that the system is inconsistent because all lines will intersect
eventually unless they are parallel. Parallel lines will never intersect; thus, the two lines have no points in common. The
graphs of the equations in this example are shown in Figure 8.

Expressing the Solution of a System of Dependent Equations Containing Two
Variables

Recall that a dependent system of equations in two variables is a system in which the two equations represent the same
line. Dependent systems have an infinite number of solutions because all of the points on one line are also on the other
line. After using substitution or addition, the resulting equation will be an identity, such as

With the addition method, we want to eliminate one of the variables by adding the equations. In this case, let's focus on
eliminating If we multiply both sides of the first equation by then we will be able to eliminate the -variable.

Now add the equations.

We can see that there will be an infinite number of solutions that satisfy both equations.

Using Systems of Equations to Investigate Profits

Using what we have learned about systems of equations, we can return to the skateboard manufacturing problem at the

beginning of the section. The skateboard manufacturer's revenue function is the function used to calculate the amount

of money that comes into the business. It can be represented by the equation     where quantity and price.

The revenue function is shown in orange in Figure 10.

The cost function is the function used to calculate the costs of doing business. It includes fixed costs, such as rent and
salaries, and variable costs, such as utilities. The cost function is shown in blue in Figure 10. The -axis represents
quantity in hundreds of units. The y-axis represents either cost or revenue in hundreds of dollars.

                                                       Figure 10

The point at which the two lines intersect is called the break-even point. We can see from the graph that if 700 units are
produced, the cost is $3,300 and the revenue is also $3,300. In other words, the company breaks even if they produce
and sell 700 units. They neither make money nor lose money.

The shaded region to the right of the break-even point represents quantities for which the company makes a profit. The

shaded region to the left represents quantities for which the company suffers a loss. The profit function is the revenue

function minus the cost function, written as                      Clearly, knowing the quantity for which the cost equals

Finding the Break-Even Point and the Profit Function Using Substitution

Given the cost function                         and the revenue function                find the break-even point and

the profit function.

     Solution
Write the system of equations using to replace function notation.

Substitute the expression  from the first equation into the second equation and solve for

Then, we substitute        into either the cost function or the revenue function.

The break-even point is
The profit function is found using the formula

The profit function is

     Analysis
The cost to produce 50,000 units is $77,500, and the revenue from the sales of 50,000 units is also $77,500. To make a
profit, the business must produce and sell more than 50,000 units. See Figure 11.

                                                Figure 11

We see from the graph in Figure 12 that the profit function has a negative value until  when the graph

crosses the x-axis. Then, the graph emerges into positive y-values and continues on this path as the profit function is a

straight line. This illustrates that the break-even point for businesses occurs when the profit function is 0. The area to the

left of the break-even point represents operating at a loss.

The cost of a ticket to the circus is          for children and  for adults. On a certain day, attendance at the circus is

and the total gate revenue is                  How many children and how many adults bought tickets?

     Solution
Let c = the number of children and a = the number of adults in attendance.

The total number of people is                  We can use this to write an equation for the number of people at the circus that
day.

write an equation for the revenue.

We now have a system of linear equations in two variables.

In the first equation, the coefficient of both variables is 1. We can quickly solve the first equation for either or  We will
solve for

Substitute the expression                      in the second equation for and solve for

Substitute    into the first equation to solve for

We find that  children and adults bought tickets to the circus that day.

Understanding the correct approach to setting up problems such as this one makes finding a solution a matter of
following a pattern. We will solve this and similar problems involving three equations and three variables in this section.
Doing so uses similar techniques as those used to solve systems of two equations in two variables. However, finding
solutions to systems of three equations requires a bit more organization and a touch of visualization.

Solving Systems of Three Equations in Three Variables

In order to solve systems of equations in three variables, known as three-by-three systems, the primary tool we will be

using is called Gaussian elimination, named after the prolific German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss. While there is

no definitive order in which operations are to be performed, there are specific guidelines as to what type of moves can

be made. We may number the equations to keep track of the steps we apply. The goal is to eliminate one variable at a

time to achieve upper triangular form, the ideal form for a three-by-three system because it allows for straightforward

back-substitution to find a solution           which we call an ordered triple. A system in upper triangular form looks like

the following:

The third equation can be solved for and then we back-substitute to find and  To write the system in upper
triangular form, we can perform the following operations:

1. Interchange the order of any two equations.
2. Multiply both sides of an equation by a nonzero constant.
3. Add a nonzero multiple of one equation to another equation.

The solution set to a three-by-three system is an ordered triple       Graphically, the ordered triple defines the

point that is the intersection of three planes in space. You can visualize such an intersection by imagining any corner in a

rectangular room. A corner is defined by three planes: two adjoining walls and the floor (or ceiling). Any point where two

walls and the floor meet represents the intersection of three planes.

Number of Possible Solutions

Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate possible solution scenarios for three-by-three systems.

· Systems that have a single solution are those which, after elimination, result in a solution set consisting of an

ordered triple                   Graphically, the ordered triple defines a point that is the intersection of three planes in

space.

· Systems that have an infinite number of solutions are those which, after elimination, result in an expression that

is always true, such as  Graphically, an infinite number of solutions represents a line or coincident plane

that serves as the intersection of three planes in space.

· Systems that have no solution are those that, after elimination, result in a statement that is a contradiction, such

as         Graphically, a system with no solution is represented by three planes with no point in common.

other, but not at a common point. (b) Two of the planes are parallel and intersect with the third plane, but not with
each other. (c) All three planes are parallel, so there is no point of intersection.

equations (1) and (2).

Solving a Real-World Problem Using a System of Three Equations in Three Variables
In the problem posed at the beginning of the section, Jordi invested his inheritance of $12,000 in three different funds:
part in a money-market fund paying 3% interest annually; part in municipal bonds paying 4% annually; and the rest in
mutual funds paying 7% annually. Jordi invested $4,000 more in mutual funds than he invested in municipal bonds. The
total interest earned in one year was $670. How much did he invest in each type of fund?

     Solution
To solve this problem, we use all of the information given and set up three equations. First, we assign a variable to each
of the three investment amounts:

The first equation indicates that the sum of the three principal amounts is $12,000.
We form the second equation according to the information that Jordi invested $4,000 more in mutual funds than he
invested in municipal bonds.
The third equation shows that the total amount of interest earned from each fund equals $670.
Then, we write the three equations as a system.

To make the calculations simpler, we can multiply the third equation by 100. Thus,

Step 1. Interchange equation (2) and equation (3) so that the two equations with three variables will line up.

Step 2. Multiply equation (1) by and add to equation (2). Write the result as row 2.

Identifying Inconsistent Systems of Equations Containing Three Variables

Just as with systems of equations in two variables, we may come across an inconsistent system of equations in three

variables, which means that it does not have a solution that satisfies all three equations. The equations could represent

three parallel planes, two parallel planes and one intersecting plane, or three planes that intersect the other two but not

at the same location. The process of elimination will result in a false statement, such as   or some other

contradiction.

Then, we multiply equation (4) by 2 and add it to equation (5).

In this system, each plane intersects the other two, but not at the same location. Therefore, the system is inconsistent.

Expressing the Solution of a System of Dependent Equations Containing Three
Variables

We know from working with systems of equations in two variables that a dependent system of equations has an infinite
number of solutions. The same is true for dependent systems of equations in three variables. An infinite number of
solutions can result from several situations. The three planes could be the same, so that a solution to one equation will
be the solution to the other two equations. All three equations could be different but they intersect on a line, which has
infinite solutions. Or two of the equations could be the same and intersect the third on a line.

First, we can multiply equation (1) by

We do not need to proceed any further. The result we get is an identity,  which tells us that this system has an

infinite number of solutions. There are other ways to begin to solve this system, such as multiplying equation (3) by

and adding it to equation (1). We then perform the same steps as above and find the same result,

infinite, as all points along the intersection line will satisfy all three equations.

Halley's Comet (Figure 1) orbits the sun about once every 75 years. Its path can be considered to be a very elongated
ellipse. Other comets follow similar paths in space. These orbital paths can be studied using systems of equations. These
systems, however, are different from the ones we considered in the previous section because the equations are not
linear.

In this section, we will consider the intersection of a parabola and a line, a circle and a line, and a circle and an ellipse.

Solving a System of Nonlinear Equations Using Substitution

A system of nonlinear equations is a system of two or more equations in two or more variables containing at least one

equation that is not linear. Recall that a linear equation can take the form                    Any equation that cannot

be written in this form in nonlinear. The substitution method we used for linear systems is the same method we will use

for nonlinear systems. We solve one equation for one variable and then substitute the result into the second equation to

solve for another variable, and so on. There is, however, a variation in the possible outcomes.

Solving a System of Nonlinear Equations Using Elimination

We have seen that substitution is often the preferred method when a system of equations includes a linear equation and
a nonlinear equation. However, when both equations in the system have like variables of the second degree, solving
them using elimination by addition is often easier than substitution. Generally, elimination is a far simpler method when
the system involves only two equations in two variables (a two-by-two system), rather than a three-by-three system, as
there are fewer steps. As an example, we will investigate the possible types of solutions when solving a system of
equations representing a circle and an ellipse.

Graphing a Nonlinear Inequality

All of the equations in the systems that we have encountered so far have involved equalities, but we may also encounter
systems that involve inequalities. We have already learned to graph linear inequalities by graphing the corresponding
equation, and then shading the region represented by the inequality symbol. Now, we will follow similar steps to graph a
nonlinear inequality so that we can learn to solve systems of nonlinear inequalities. A nonlinear inequality is an
inequality containing a nonlinear expression. Graphing a nonlinear inequality is much like graphing a linear inequality.

Recall that when the inequality is greater than,  or less than,              the graph is drawn with a dashed line. When

the inequality is greater than or equal to,       or less than or equal to,  the graph is drawn with a solid line. The

graphs will create regions in the plane, and we will test each region for a solution. If one point in the region works, the

whole region works. That is the region we shade. See Figure 8.

              HOW TO

Given an inequality bounded by a parabola, sketch a graph.
 1. Graph the parabola as if it were an equation. This is the boundary for the region that is the solution set.
 2. If the boundary is included in the region (the operator is or ), the parabola is graphed as a solid line.
 3. If the boundary is not included in the region (the operator is < or >), the parabola is graphed as a dashed line.
 4. Test a point in one of the regions to determine whether it satisfies the inequality statement. If the statement is

      true, the solution set is the region including the point. If the statement is false, the solution set is the region on
      the other side of the boundary line.
 5. Shade the region representing the solution set.

Solution

First, graph the corresponding equation  Since  has a greater than symbol, we draw the graph

with a dashed line. Then we choose points to test both inside and outside the parabola. Let's test the points

and        One point is clearly inside the parabola and the other point is clearly outside.

The graph is shown in Figure 9. We can see that the solution set consists of all points inside the parabola, but not on the
graph itself.

Graphing a System of Nonlinear Inequalities

Now that we have learned to graph nonlinear inequalities, we can learn how to graph systems of nonlinear inequalities.
A system of nonlinear inequalities is a system of two or more inequalities in two or more variables containing at least
one inequality that is not linear. Graphing a system of nonlinear inequalities is similar to graphing a system of linear
inequalities. The difference is that our graph may result in more shaded regions that represent a solution than we find in
a system of linear inequalities. The solution to a nonlinear system of inequalities is the region of the graph where the
shaded regions of the graph of each inequality overlap, or where the regions intersect, called the feasible region.

Earlier in this chapter, we studied systems of two equations in two variables, systems of three equations in three
variables, and nonlinear systems. Here we introduce another way that systems of equations can be utilized--the
decomposition of rational expressions.

Fractions can be complicated; adding a variable in the denominator makes them even more so. The methods studied in
this section will help simplify the concept of a rational expression.

Decomposing                      Where Q(x) Has Only Nonrepeated Linear Factors

Recall the algebra regarding adding and subtracting rational expressions. These operations depend on finding a
common denominator so that we can write the sum or difference as a single, simplified rational expression. In this
section, we will look at partial fraction decomposition, which is the undoing of the procedure to add or subtract rational
expressions. In other words, it is a return from the single simplified rational expression to the original expressions, called
the partial fraction.

For example, suppose we add the following fractions:

We would first need to find a common denominator,

Next, we would write each expression with this common denominator and find the sum of the terms.

Partial fraction decomposition is the reverse of this procedure. We would start with the solution and rewrite
(decompose) it as the sum of two fractions.

We will investigate rational expressions with linear factors and quadratic factors in the denominator where the degree of
the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Regardless of the type of expression we are decomposing,
the first and most important thing to do is factor the denominator.

When the denominator of the simplified expression contains distinct linear factors, it is likely that each of the original

rational expressions, which were added or subtracted, had one of the linear factors as the denominator. In other words,

using the example above, the factors of        are                     the denominators of the decomposed rational

expression. So we will rewrite the simplified form as the sum of individual fractions and use a variable for each

numerator. Then, we will solve for each numerator using one of several methods available for partial fraction

decomposition.

     HOW TO

Given a rational expression with distinct linear factors in the denominator, decompose it.

1. Use a variable for the original numerators, usually   or depending on the number of factors, placing

each variable over a single factor. For the purpose of this definition, we use for each numerator

2. Multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator to eliminate fractions.
3. Expand the right side of the equation and collect like terms.
4. Set coefficients of like terms from the left side of the equation equal to those on the right side to create a system

     of equations to solve for the numerators.

Substitute  into one of the original equations in the system.

Thus, the partial fraction decomposition is

Another method to use to solve for or is by considering the equation that resulted from eliminating the fractions

and substituting a value for that will make either the A- or B-term equal 0. If we let            the

term becomes 0 and we can simply solve for

Next, either substitute  into the equation and solve for or make the B-term 0 by substituting          into the
equation.

We obtain the same values for and using either method, so the decompositions are the same using either method.

Objective 1: Write the augmented matrix for a system of equations (IA 4.5.1)

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

A matrix with m rows and n columns has dimension m×n.

Each number in the matrix is called an element or entry in the matrix.

The matrix on the left below has 2 rows and 3 columns and so it has order 2×3. We say it is a 2 by 3 matrix.

Objective 2: Add, subtract matrices and multiply a matrix by a scalar

We add or subtract matrices by adding or subtracting corresponding entries.

In order to do this, the entries must correspond. Therefore, addition and subtraction of matrices is only possible
when the matrices have the same dimensions. We can add or subtract a 3 × 3 matrix and another 3 × 3 matrix, but we
cannot add or subtract a 2 × 3 matrix and a 3 × 3 matrix because some entries in one matrix will not have a
corresponding entry in the other matrix.

The process of scalar multiplication involves multiplying each entry in a matrix by a scalar. A scalar multiple is any entry
of a matrix that results from scalar multiplication.

                     Table 1

A goal costs $300; a ball costs $10; and a jersey costs $30. How can we find the total cost for the equipment needed for
each team? In this section, we discover a method in which the data in the soccer equipment table can be displayed and
used for calculating other information. Then, we will be able to calculate the cost of the equipment.

Finding the Sum and Difference of Two Matrices

To solve a problem like the one described for the soccer teams, we can use a matrix, which is a rectangular array of

numbers. A row in a matrix is a set of numbers that are aligned horizontally. A column in a matrix is a set of numbers

that are aligned vertically. Each number is an entry, sometimes called an element, of the matrix. Matrices (plural) are

enclosed in [ ] or ( ), and are usually named with capital letters. For example, three matrices named  and are

shown below.

Describing Matrices

A matrix is often referred to by its size or dimensions:     indicating rows and columns. Matrix entries are defined

first by row and then by column. For example, to locate the entry in matrix identified as we look for the entry in

row column In matrix  shown below, the entry in row 2, column 3 is
872 7 · Systems of Equations and Inequalities

A square matrix is a matrix with dimensions      meaning that it has the same number of rows as columns. The
matrix above is an example of a square matrix.

A row matrix is a matrix consisting of one row with dimensions

A column matrix is a matrix consisting of one column with dimensions

A matrix may be used to represent a system of equations. In these cases, the numbers represent the coefficients of the
variables in the system. Matrices often make solving systems of equations easier because they are not encumbered with
variables. We will investigate this idea further in the next section, but first we will look at basic matrix operations.

Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers that is usually named by a capital letter:     and so on. Each entry in

a matrix is referred to as such that represents the row and represents the column. Matrices are often referred

to by their dimensions:          indicating rows and columns.

EXAMPLE 1

Finding the Dimensions of the Given Matrix and Locating Entries
Given matrix

 What are the dimensions of matrix              What are the entries at and

Solution

 The dimensions are              because there are three rows and three columns.

 Entry is the number at row 3, column 1, which is 3. The entry is the number at row 2, column 2, which is 4.
Remember, the row comes first, then the column.

Adding and Subtracting Matrices

We use matrices to list data or to represent systems. Because the entries are numbers, we can perform operations on
matrices. We add or subtract matrices by adding or subtracting corresponding entries.

In order to do this, the entries must correspond. Therefore, addition and subtraction of matrices is only possible when

the matrices have the same dimensions. We can add or subtract a       matrix and another  matrix, but we cannot

add or subtract a  matrix and a                matrix because some entries in one matrix will not have a corresponding

entry in the other matrix.

Adding and Subtracting Matrices

Given matrices and of like dimensions, addition and subtraction of and will produce matrix or
matrix of the same dimension.

Finding Scalar Multiples of a Matrix

Besides adding and subtracting whole matrices, there are many situations in which we need to multiply a matrix by a
constant called a scalar. Recall that a scalar is a real number quantity that has magnitude, but not direction. For example,
time, temperature, and distance are scalar quantities. The process of scalar multiplication involves multiplying each
entry in a matrix by a scalar. A scalar multiple is any entry of a matrix that results from scalar multiplication.

Consider a real-world scenario in which a university needs to add to its inventory of computers, computer tables, and
chairs in two of the campus labs due to increased enrollment. They estimate that 15% more equipment is needed in both
labs. The school's current inventory is displayed in Table 2.

Converting the data to a matrix, we have

To calculate how much computer equipment will be needed, we multiply all entries in matrix by 0.15.

We must round up to the next integer, so the amount of new equipment needed is

Adding the two matrices as shown below, we see the new inventory amounts.

This means

Thus, Lab A will have 18 computers, 19 computer tables, and 19 chairs; Lab B will have 32 computers, 40 computer tables,
and 40 chairs.

Finding the Product of Two Matrices

In addition to multiplying a matrix by a scalar, we can multiply two matrices. Finding the product of two matrices is only

possible when the inner dimensions are the same, meaning that the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to

the number of rows of the second matrix. If is an  matrix and is an          matrix, then the product matrix is

an  matrix. For example, the product is possible because the number of columns in is the same as the

number of rows in If the inner dimensions do not match, the product is not defined.

We multiply entries of with entries of according to a specific pattern as outlined below. The process of matrix
multiplication becomes clearer when working a problem with real numbers.

To obtain the entries in row of we multiply the entries in row of by column in       and add. For example, given

2. To obtain the entry in row 1, column 2 of multiply the first row of by the second column in and add.

Solution

 As the dimensions of are         and the dimensions of are               these matrices can be multiplied together
                                  matches the number of rows in
because the number of columns in                                          The resulting product will be a  matrix,

the number of rows in by the number of columns in

 The dimensions of are            and the dimensions of are               The inner dimensions match so the product is

defined and will be a  matrix.

     Analysis
Notice that the products and are not equal.

This illustrates the fact that matrix multiplication is not commutative.

Q&A       Is it possible for AB to be defined but not BA?

          Yes, consider a matrix A with dimension     and matrix B with dimension  For the product AB the

          inner dimensions are 4 and the product is defined, but for the product BA the inner dimensions are 2 and

          3 so the product is undefined.

for at least one variable. We then substitute this value in another equation to continue to solve for the other variables.

Figure 1 German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855).

Carl Friedrich Gauss lived during the late 18th century and early 19th century, but he is still considered one of the most
prolific mathematicians in history. His contributions to the science of mathematics and physics span fields such as
algebra, number theory, analysis, differential geometry, astronomy, and optics, among others. His discoveries regarding
matrix theory changed the way mathematicians have worked for the last two centuries.

We first encountered Gaussian elimination in Systems of Linear Equations: Two Variables. In this section, we will revisit
this technique for solving systems, this time using matrices.

Writing the Augmented Matrix of a System of Equations

A matrix can serve as a device for representing and solving a system of equations. To express a system in matrix form,
we extract the coefficients of the variables and the constants, and these become the entries of the matrix. We use a
vertical line to separate the coefficient entries from the constants, essentially replacing the equal signs. When a system is
written in this form, we call it an augmented matrix.

For example, consider the following  system of equations.
888 7 · Systems of Equations and Inequalities

We can write this system as an augmented matrix:
We can also write a matrix containing just the coefficients. This is called the coefficient matrix.
A three-by-three system of equations such as

has a coefficient matrix

and is represented by the augmented matrix

Notice that the matrix is written so that the variables line up in their own columns: x-terms go in the first column,

y-terms in the second column, and z-terms in the third column. It is very important that each equation is written in

standard form                    so that the variables line up. When there is a missing variable term in an equation, the

coefficient is 0.

...

     HOW TO

Given a system of equations, write an augmented matrix.

 1. Write the coefficients of the x-terms as the numbers down the first column.
 2. Write the coefficients of the y-terms as the numbers down the second column.
 3. If there are z-terms, write the coefficients as the numbers down the third column.
 4. Draw a vertical line and write the constants to the right of the line.

Writing a System of Equations from an Augmented Matrix

We can use augmented matrices to help us solve systems of equations because they simplify operations when the
systems are not encumbered by the variables. However, it is important to understand how to move back and forth
between formats in order to make finding solutions smoother and more intuitive. Here, we will use the information in an
augmented matrix to write the system of equations in standard form.

Performing Row Operations on a Matrix

Now that we can write systems of equations in augmented matrix form, we will examine the various row operations
that can be performed on a matrix, such as addition, multiplication by a constant, and interchanging rows.
Performing row operations on a matrix is the method we use for solving a system of equations. In order to solve the
system of equations, we want to convert the matrix to row-echelon form, in which there are ones down the main
diagonal from the upper left corner to the lower right corner, and zeros in every position below the main diagonal as
shown.

We use row operations corresponding to equation operations to obtain a new matrix that is row-equivalent in a simpler
form. Here are the guidelines to obtaining row-echelon form.

1. In any nonzero row, the first nonzero number is a 1. It is called a leading 1.
2. Any all-zero rows are placed at the bottom on the matrix.
3. Any leading 1 is below and to the right of a previous leading 1.
4. Any column containing a leading 1 has zeros in all other positions in the column.

To solve a system of equations we can perform the following row operations to convert the coefficient matrix to row-
echelon form and do back-substitution to find the solution.

1. Interchange rows. (Notation:           )
890 7 · Systems of Equations and Inequalities

        2. Multiply a row by a constant. (Notation: )
        3. Add the product of a row multiplied by a constant to another row. (Notation:
       Each of the row operations corresponds to the operations we have already learned to solve systems of equations in
       three variables. With these operations, there are some key moves that will quickly achieve the goal of writing a matrix in
       row-echelon form. To obtain a matrix in row-echelon form for finding solutions, we use Gaussian elimination, a method
       that uses row operations to obtain a 1 as the first entry so that row 1 can be used to convert the remaining rows.

         Gaussian Elimination

         The Gaussian elimination method refers to a strategy used to obtain the row-echelon form of a matrix. The goal is
         to write matrix with the number 1 as the entry down the main diagonal and have all zeros below.

The first step of the Gaussian strategy includes obtaining a 1 as the first entry, so that row 1 may be used to alter the
rows below.

           ...

              HOW TO

Given an augmented matrix, perform row operations to achieve row-echelon form.

 1. The first equation should have a leading coefficient of 1. Interchange rows or multiply by a constant, if necessary.
 2. Use row operations to obtain zeros down the first column below the first entry of 1.
 3. Use row operations to obtain a 1 in row 2, column 2.
 4. Use row operations to obtain zeros down column 2, below the entry of 1.
 5. Use row operations to obtain a 1 in row 3, column 3.
 6. Continue this process for all rows until there is a 1 in every entry down the main diagonal and there are only

      zeros below.
 7. If any rows contain all zeros, place them at the bottom.

Strategy for evaluating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix
To evaluate a 3×3 determinant we can expand by minors using any row or column. Choosing a row or column other than
the first row sometimes makes the work easier.

When we expand by any row or column, we must be careful about the sign of the terms in the expansion. To determine
the sign of the terms, we use the following sign pattern chart.

Expanding by minors along the first row to evaluate a 3x3 determinant.
To evaluate a 3×3 determinant by expanding by minors along the first row, we use the following pattern:

NOTE: We can evaluate the determinant of a matrix by expanding minors along any row or column. When a row or a

the following equations.

The identity matrix acts as a 1 in matrix algebra. For example,
A matrix that has a multiplicative inverse has the properties

A matrix that has a multiplicative inverse is called an invertible matrix. Only a square matrix may have a multiplicative

inverse, as the reversibility,                 is a requirement. Not all square matrices have an inverse, but if is

invertible, then  is unique. We will look at two methods for finding the inverse of a      matrix and a third method

Solving a System of Linear Equations Using the Inverse of a Matrix                                               is the

Solving a system of linear equations using the inverse of a matrix requires the definition of two new matrices:
matrix representing the variables of the system, and is the matrix representing the constants. Using matrix
multiplication, we may define a system of equations with the same number of equations as variables as

To solve a system of linear equations using an inverse matrix, let be the coefficient matrix, let be the variable

matrix, and let be the constant matrix. Thus, we want to solve a system  For example, look at the following

system of equations.

From this system, the coefficient matrix is

The variable matrix is

And the constant matrix is

Then  looks like

Recall the discussion earlier in this section regarding multiplying a real number by its inverse,                  To

solve a single linear equation  for we would simply multiply both sides of the equation by the multiplicative

The only difference between a solving a linear equation and a system of equations written in matrix form is that finding
the inverse of a matrix is more complicated, and matrix multiplication is a longer process. However, the goal is the
same--to isolate the variable.

We will investigate this idea in detail, but it is helpful to begin with a  system and then move on to a  system.

Solving a System of Equations Using the Inverse of a Matrix

Given a system of equations, write the coefficient matrix the variable matrix and the constant matrix Then

Multiply both sides by the inverse of to obtain the solution.

      Q&A  If the coefficient matrix does not have an inverse, does that mean the system has no solution?

           No, if the coefficient matrix is not invertible, the system could be inconsistent and have no solution, or be
           dependent and have infinitely many solutions.

2. Use Cramer's Rule to solve the system of three equations.

We have learned how to solve systems of equations in two variables and three variables, and by multiple methods:
substitution, addition, Gaussian elimination, using the inverse of a matrix, and graphing. Some of these methods are
easier to apply than others and are more appropriate in certain situations. In this section, we will study two more
strategies for solving systems of equations.

Evaluating the Determinant of a 2×2 Matrix

A determinant is a real number that can be very useful in mathematics because it has multiple applications, such as
calculating area, volume, and other quantities. Here, we will use determinants to reveal whether a matrix is invertible by
using the entries of a square matrix to determine whether there is a solution to the system of equations. Perhaps one of
the more interesting applications, however, is their use in cryptography. Secure signals or messages are sometimes sent
encoded in a matrix. The data can only be decrypted with an invertible matrix and the determinant. For our purposes,
we focus on the determinant as an indication of the invertibility of the matrix. Calculating the determinant of a matrix
involves following the specific patterns that are outlined in this section.

Solution

Using Cramer's Rule to Solve a System of Two Equations in Two Variables

We will now introduce a final method for solving systems of equations that uses determinants. Known as Cramer's Rule,
this technique dates back to the middle of the 18th century and is named for its innovator, the Swiss mathematician
Gabriel Cramer (1704-1752), who introduced it in 1750 in Introduction à l'Analyse des lignes Courbes algébriques.
Cramer's Rule is a viable and efficient method for finding solutions to systems with an arbitrary number of unknowns,
provided that we have the same number of equations as unknowns.
Cramer's Rule will give us the unique solution to a system of equations, if it exists. However, if the system has no
solution or an infinite number of solutions, this will be indicated by a determinant of zero. To find out if the system is
inconsistent or dependent, another method, such as elimination, will have to be used.
To understand Cramer's Rule, let's look closely at how we solve systems of linear equations using basic row operations.
Consider a system of two equations in two variables.

We eliminate one variable using row operations and solve for the other. Say that we wish to solve for If equation (2) is
multiplied by the opposite of the coefficient of in equation (1), equation (1) is multiplied by the coefficient of in
equation (2), and we add the two equations, the variable will be eliminated.

Now, solve for
924 7 · Systems of Equations and Inequalities

Similarly, to solve for we will eliminate
Solving for gives

Notice that the denominator for both and is the determinant of the coefficient matrix.

We can use these formulas to solve for and but Cramer's Rule also introduces new notation:

·  determinant of the coefficient matrix

·  determinant of the numerator in the solution of

·  determinant of the numerator in the solution of

The key to Cramer's Rule is replacing the variable column of interest with the constant column and calculating the
determinants. We can then express and as a quotient of two determinants.

  Cramer's Rule for 2×2 Systems

  Cramer's Rule is a method that uses determinants to solve systems of equations that have the same number of
  equations as variables.
  Consider a system of two linear equations in two variables.

The solution using Cramer's Rule is given as

If we are solving for the column is replaced with the constant column. If we are solving for  the column is
replaced with the constant column.

Evaluating the Determinant of a 3 × 3 Matrix

Finding the determinant of a 2×2 matrix is straightforward, but finding the determinant of a 3×3 matrix is more
complicated. One method is to augment the 3×3 matrix with a repetition of the first two columns, giving a 3×5 matrix.
Then we calculate the sum of the products of entries down each of the three diagonals (upper left to lower right), and
subtract the products of entries up each of the three diagonals (lower left to upper right). This is more easily understood
with a visual and an example.
Find the determinant of the 3×3 matrix.

 1. Augment with the first two columns.

 2. From upper left to lower right: Multiply the entries down the first diagonal. Add the result to the product of entries
      down the second diagonal. Add this result to the product of the entries down the third diagonal.

 3. From lower left to upper right: Subtract the product of entries up the first diagonal. From this result subtract the
      product of entries up the second diagonal. From this result, subtract the product of entries up the third diagonal.

The algebra is as follows:

Q&A  Can we use the same method to find the determinant of a larger matrix?

     No, this method only works for  and  matrices. For larger matrices it is best to use a graphing

     utility or computer software.

Using Cramer's Rule to Solve a System of Three Equations in Three Variables

Now that we can find the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix, we can apply Cramer's Rule to solve a system of three equations
in three variables. Cramer's Rule is straightforward, following a pattern consistent with Cramer's Rule for 2 × 2 matrices.
As the order of the matrix increases to 3 × 3, however, there are many more calculations required.

When we calculate the determinant to be zero, Cramer's Rule gives no indication as to whether the system has no
solution or an infinite number of solutions. To find out, we have to perform elimination on the system.

Consider a 3 × 3 system of equations.

If we are writing the determinant we replace the column with the constant column. If we are writing the
determinant we replace the column with the constant column. If we are writing the determinant we replace

     Solution
We begin by finding the determinants

We know that a determinant of zero means that either the system has no solution or it has an infinite number of
solutions. To see which one, we use the process of elimination. Our goal is to eliminate one of the variables.
 1. Multiply equation (1) by
 2. Add the result to equation

We obtain the equation         which is false. Therefore, the system has no solution. Graphing the system reveals two
parallel lines. See Figure 1.

elimination to find out.
 1. Multiply equation (1) by and add the result to equation (3):

2. Obtaining an answer of                      a statement that is always true, means that the system has an infinite number of

solutions. Graphing the system, we can see that two of the planes are the same and they both intersect the third

plane on a line. See Figure 2.

Key Concepts

7.1 Systems of Linear Equations: Two Variables

· A system of linear equations consists of two or more equations made up of two or more variables such that all
    equations in the system are considered simultaneously.

· The solution to a system of linear equations in two variables is any ordered pair that satisfies each equation
    independently. See Example 1.

· Systems of equations are classified as independent with one solution, dependent with an infinite number of
    solutions, or inconsistent with no solution.

· One method of solving a system of linear equations in two variables is by graphing. In this method, we graph the
    equations on the same set of axes. See Example 2.

· Another method of solving a system of linear equations is by substitution. In this method, we solve for one variable
    in one equation and substitute the result into the second equation. See Example 3.

· A third method of solving a system of linear equations is by addition, in which we can eliminate a variable by adding
    opposite coefficients of corresponding variables. See Example 4.

· It is often necessary to multiply one or both equations by a constant to facilitate elimination of a variable when
    adding the two equations together. See Example 5, Example 6, and Example 7.

· Either method of solving a system of equations results in a false statement for inconsistent systems because they
    are made up of parallel lines that never intersect. See Example 8.

· The solution to a system of dependent equations will always be true because both equations describe the same line.
    See Example 9.

· Systems of equations can be used to solve real-world problems that involve more than one variable, such as those
    relating to revenue, cost, and profit. See Example 10 and Example 11.

7.2 Systems of Linear Equations: Three Variables

· A solution set is an ordered triple    that represents the intersection of three planes in space. See

Example 1.

· A system of three equations in three variables can be solved by using a series of steps that forces a variable to be

eliminated. The steps include interchanging the order of equations, multiplying both sides of an equation by a

nonzero constant, and adding a nonzero multiple of one equation to another equation. See Example 2.

· Systems of three equations in three variables are useful for solving many different types of real-world problems. See

Example 3.

· A system of equations in three variables is inconsistent if no solution exists. After performing elimination

operations, the result is a contradiction. See Example 4.

· Systems of equations in three variables that are inconsistent could result from three parallel planes, two parallel

planes and one intersecting plane, or three planes that intersect the other two but not at the same location.

· A system of equations in three variables is dependent if it has an infinite number of solutions. After performing

elimination operations, the result is an identity. See Example 5.

· Systems of equations in three variables that are dependent could result from three identical planes, three planes

intersecting at a line, or two identical planes that intersect the third on a line.

7.3 Systems of Nonlinear Equations and Inequalities: Two Variables

· There are three possible types of solutions to a system of equations representing a line and a parabola: (1) no
    solution, the line does not intersect the parabola; (2) one solution, the line is tangent to the parabola; and (3) two

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                    7 · Chapter Review 937

    solutions, the line intersects the parabola in two points. See Example 1.
· There are three possible types of solutions to a system of equations representing a circle and a line: (1) no solution,

    the line does not intersect the circle; (2) one solution, the line is tangent to the circle; (3) two solutions, the line
    intersects the circle in two points. See Example 2.
· There are five possible types of solutions to the system of nonlinear equations representing an ellipse and a circle:
    (1) no solution, the circle and the ellipse do not intersect; (2) one solution, the circle and the ellipse are tangent to
    each other; (3) two solutions, the circle and the ellipse intersect in two points; (4) three solutions, the circle and
    ellipse intersect in three places; (5) four solutions, the circle and the ellipse intersect in four points. See Example 3.
· An inequality is graphed in much the same way as an equation, except for > or <, we draw a dashed line and shade
    the region containing the solution set. See Example 4.
· Inequalities are solved the same way as equalities, but solutions to systems of inequalities must satisfy both
    inequalities. See Example 5.

7.4 Partial Fractions

· Decompose     by writing the partial fractions as  Solve by clearing the fractions, expanding the

right side, collecting like terms, and setting corresponding coefficients equal to each other, then setting up and
solving a system of equations. See Example 1.

· The decomposition of     with repeated linear factors must account for the factors of the denominator in

increasing powers. See Example 2.

· The decomposition of     with a nonrepeated irreducible quadratic factor needs a linear numerator over the

quadratic factor, as in             See Example 3.

· In the decomposition of  where    has a repeated irreducible quadratic factor, when the irreducible

quadratic factors are repeated, powers of the denominator factors must be represented in increasing powers as

See Example 4.

7.5 Matrices and Matrix Operations

· A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Entries are arranged in rows and columns.

· The dimensions of a matrix refer to the number of rows and the number of columns. A    matrix has three rows

and two columns. See Example 1.

· We add and subtract matrices of equal dimensions by adding and subtracting corresponding entries of each matrix.

See Example 2, Example 3, Example 4, and Example 5.

· Scalar multiplication involves multiplying each entry in a matrix by a constant. See Example 6.

· Scalar multiplication is often required before addition or subtraction can occur. See Example 7.

· Multiplying matrices is possible when inner dimensions are the same--the number of columns in the first matrix

must match the number of rows in the second.

· The product of two matrices, and is obtained by multiplying each entry in row 1 of by each entry in column 1

of then multiply each entry of row 1 of by each entry in columns 2 of and so on. See Example 8 and Example

9.

· Many real-world problems can often be solved using matrices. See Example 10.

· We can use a calculator to perform matrix operations after saving each matrix as a matrix variable. See Example 11.

7.6 Solving Systems with Gaussian Elimination

· An augmented matrix is one that contains the coefficients and constants of a system of equations. See Example 1.
· A matrix augmented with the constant column can be represented as the original system of equations. See Example

    2.
· Row operations include multiplying a row by a constant, adding one row to another row, and interchanging rows.
· We can use Gaussian elimination to solve a system of equations. See Example 3, Example 4, and Example 5.
· Row operations are performed on matrices to obtain row-echelon form. See Example 6.
· To solve a system of equations, write it in augmented matrix form. Perform row operations to obtain row-echelon

    form. Back-substitute to find the solutions. See Example 7 and Example 8.
· A calculator can be used to solve systems of equations using matrices. See Example 9.
· Many real-world problems can be solved using augmented matrices. See Example 10 and Example 11.

7.7 Solving Systems with Inverses

    · An identity matrix has the property       See Example 1.

    · An invertible matrix has the property                  See Example 2.

    · Use matrix multiplication and the identity to find the inverse of a      matrix. See Example 3.

    · The multiplicative inverse can be found using a formula. See Example 4.

    · Another method of finding the inverse is by augmenting with the identity. See Example 5.

    · We can augment a           matrix with the identity on the right and use row operations to turn the original matrix into

    the identity, and the matrix on the right becomes the inverse. See Example 6.

    · Write the system of equations as          and multiply both sides by the inverse of                  See

    Example 7 and Example 8.

    · We can also use a calculator to solve a system of equations with matrix inverses. See Example 9.

7.8 Solving Systems with Cramer's Rule

    · The determinant for        is          See Example 1.

    · Cramer's Rule replaces a variable column with the constant column. Solutions are                     See Example 2.

    · To find the determinant of a 3×3 matrix, augment with the first two columns. Add the three diagonal entries (upper
        left to lower right) and subtract the three diagonal entries (lower left to upper right). See Example 3.

    · To solve a system of three equations in three variables using Cramer's Rule, replace a variable column with the

    constant column for each desired solution:                                 See Example 4.

    · Cramer's Rule is also useful for finding the solution of a system of equations with no solution or infinite solutions.

    See Example 5 and Example 6.

    · Certain properties of determinants are useful for solving problems. For example:

     If the matrix is in upper triangular form, the determinant equals the product of entries down the main diagonal.

     When two rows are interchanged, the determinant changes sign.

     If either two rows or two columns are identical, the determinant equals zero.

     If a matrix contains either a row of zeros or a column of zeros, the determinant equals zero.

     The determinant of an inverse matrix       is the reciprocal of the determinant of the matrix

     If any row or column is multiplied by a constant, the determinant is multiplied by the same factor. See Example 7

    and Example 8.

The rings of Saturn have produced wonder, as well as misunderstanding, since Galileo first discovered them (he initially
thought they were moons). Though they appear to be a series of solid discs even in this 2004 closeup from the Cassini
probe, 19th century mathematicians proved that they are made up of billions of small objects clustered together. (credit:

      Introduction to Analytic Geometry

The Greek mathematician Menaechmus (c. 380-c. 320 BCE) is generally credited with discovering the shapes formed by
the intersection of a plane and a right circular cone. Depending on how he tilted the plane when it intersected the cone,
he formed different shapes at the intersection-beautiful shapes with near-perfect symmetry.

It was also said that Aristotle may have had an intuitive understanding of these shapes, as he observed the orbit of the
planet to be circular. He presumed that the planets moved in circular orbits around Earth, and for nearly 2000 years this
was the commonly held belief.

It was not until the Renaissance movement that Johannes Kepler noticed that the orbits of the planet were not circular in
nature. His published law of planetary motion in the 1600s changed our view of the solar system forever. He claimed that
the sun was at one end of the orbits, and the planets revolved around the sun in an oval-shaped path.

Other objects in the solar system (and perhaps other systems) follow a similar elliptical path, including the spectacular
rings of Saturn. Using this understanding as a basis, 19th century mathematicians like James Clerk Maxwell and Sofya
Kovalevskaya showed that despite their appearance through the telescopes of the day (and even in current telescopes),
the rings are not solid and continuous, but are rather composed of small particles. Even after the Voyager and Cassini
missions have provided close-up and detailed data regarding the ring structures, full understanding of their construction
relies heavily on mathematical analysis. Of particular interest are the influences of Saturn's moons and moonlets, and
the ways they both disrupt and preserve the ring structure.

In this chapter, we will investigate the two-dimensional figures that are formed when a right circular cone is intersected
by a plane. We will begin by studying each of three figures created in this manner. We will develop defining equations for
each figure and then learn how to use these equations to solve a variety of problems.

But what happens if we have to solve an equation where the trinomial is not a perfect square?

For example,                     ? For these types of equations, we can use a process called completing the square.

Recall                                                                   .

EXAMPLE 1

Complete the square of a binomial expression

Complete the square for  to make it a perfect square.

    Solution

    Since there is a plus sign between the two terms, we will use the (a + b)2 pattern
                                        .

    We ultimately need to find the last term of this trinomial that will make it a perfect square

    trinomial. To do that we will need to find b. But first we start with determining a. Notice that
    the first term of x2 + 6x is a square, x2. This tells us that a = x.

    What number, b, when multiplied with 2x, gives 6x? It would have to be 3, which is (½)(6).
    So b = 3.

    Now to complete the perfect square trinomial, we will find the last term by squaring b, which
    is 32 = 9.

    We can now factor.

So, we found that adding 9 to x2 + 6x completes the square, and we write it as (x + 3)2.

Figure 1 The National Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C. (credit: Greg Palmer, Flickr)
950 8 · Analytic Geometry

       Can you imagine standing at one end of a large room and still being able to hear a whisper from a person standing at
       the other end? The National Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C., shown in Figure 1, is such a room.1 It is an semi-circular
       room called a whispering chamber because the shape makes it possible for sound to travel along the walls and dome. In
       this section, we will investigate the shape of this room and its real-world applications, including how far apart two people
       in Statuary Hall can stand and still hear each other whisper.

     Writing Equations of Ellipses in Standard Form

       A conic section, or conic, is a shape resulting from intersecting a right circular cone with a plane. The angle at which the
       plane intersects the cone determines the shape, as shown in Figure 2.

                                                  Figure 2

Conic sections can also be described by a set of points in the coordinate plane. Later in this chapter, we will see that the

graph of any quadratic equation in two variables is a conic section. The signs of the equations and the coefficients of the

variable terms determine the shape. This section focuses on the four variations of the standard form of the equation for

the ellipse. An ellipse is the set of all points  in a plane such that the sum of their distances from two fixed points is

a constant. Each fixed point is called a focus (plural: foci).

We can draw an ellipse using a piece of cardboard, two thumbtacks, a pencil, and string. Place the thumbtacks in the
cardboard to form the foci of the ellipse. Cut a piece of string longer than the distance between the two thumbtacks (the
length of the string represents the constant in the definition). Tack each end of the string to the cardboard, and trace a
curve with a pencil held taut against the string. The result is an ellipse. See Figure 3.

Every ellipse has two axes of symmetry. The longer axis is called the major axis, and the shorter axis is called the minor
axis. Each endpoint of the major axis is the vertex of the ellipse (plural: vertices), and each endpoint of the minor axis is
a co-vertex of the ellipse. The center of an ellipse is the midpoint of both the major and minor axes. The axes are
perpendicular at the center. The foci always lie on the major axis, and the sum of the distances from the foci to any point
on the ellipse (the constant sum) is greater than the distance between the foci. See Figure 4.

               Figure 4

In this section, we restrict ellipses to those that are positioned vertically or horizontally in the coordinate plane. That is,
the axes will either lie on or be parallel to the x- and y-axes. Later in the chapter, we will see ellipses that are rotated in
the coordinate plane.

To work with horizontal and vertical ellipses in the coordinate plane, we consider two cases: those that are centered at
the origin and those that are centered at a point other than the origin. First we will learn to derive the equations of
ellipses, and then we will learn how to write the equations of ellipses in standard form. Later we will use what we learn to
draw the graphs.

Deriving the Equation of an Ellipse Centered at the Origin

To derive the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin, we begin with the foci  and  The ellipse is the set

of all points  such that the sum of the distances from  to the foci is constant, as shown in Figure 5.

If  is a point on the ellipse, then we can define the following variables:

distances is for the vertex       It follows that              for any point on the ellipse. We will begin the derivation

by applying the distance formula. The rest of the derivation is algebraic.

Thus, the standard equation of an ellipse is       This equation defines an ellipse centered at the origin. If

Writing Equations of Ellipses Centered at the Origin in Standard Form

Standard forms of equations tell us about key features of graphs. Take a moment to recall some of the standard forms of
equations we've worked with in the past: linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential, logarithmic, and so on. By learning to
interpret standard forms of equations, we are bridging the relationship between algebraic and geometric
representations of mathematical phenomena.

The key features of the ellipse are its center, vertices, co-vertices, foci, and lengths and positions of the major and minor
axes. Just as with other equations, we can identify all of these features just by looking at the standard form of the
equation. There are four variations of the standard form of the ellipse. These variations are categorized first by the
location of the center (the origin or not the origin), and then by the position (horizontal or vertical). Each is presented
along with a description of how the parts of the equation relate to the graph. Interpreting these parts allows us to form
a mental picture of the ellipse.

       Many real-world situations can be represented by ellipses, including orbits of planets, satellites, moons and comets, and

       break up kidney stones by generating sound waves. Some buildings, called whispering chambers, are designed with
       elliptical domes so that a person whispering at one focus can easily be heard by someone standing at the other focus.
       This occurs because of the acoustic properties of an ellipse. When a sound wave originates at one focus of a whispering
       chamber, the sound wave will be reflected off the elliptical dome and back to the other focus. See Figure 12. In the

A hyperbola is all points in a plane where the difference of their distances from two fixed points is constant. Each of the
fixed points is called a focus of the hyperbola.
The line through the foci is called the transverse axis. The two points where the transverse axis intersects the hyperbola
are each a vertex of the hyperbola. The midpoint of the segment joining the foci is called the center of the hyperbola.
The line perpendicular to the transverse axis that passes through the center is called the conjugate axis. Each piece of
the graph is called a branch of the hyperbola.

What do paths of comets, supersonic booms, ancient Grecian pillars, and natural draft cooling towers have in common?
They can all be modeled by the same type of conic. For instance, when something moves faster than the speed of sound,
a shock wave in the form of a cone is created. A portion of a conic is formed when the wave intersects the ground,
resulting in a sonic boom. See Figure 1.

            Figure 1 A shock wave intersecting the ground forms a portion of a conic and results in a sonic boom.

Most people are familiar with the sonic boom created by supersonic aircraft, but humans were breaking the sound
barrier long before the first supersonic flight. The crack of a whip occurs because the tip is exceeding the speed of
sound. The bullets shot from many firearms also break the sound barrier, although the bang of the gun usually
supersedes the sound of the sonic boom.

Locating the Vertices and Foci of a Hyperbola

In analytic geometry, a hyperbola is a conic section formed by intersecting a right circular cone with a plane at an angle
such that both halves of the cone are intersected. This intersection produces two separate unbounded curves that are
972 8 · Analytic Geometry

       mirror images of each other. See Figure 2.

                                                   Figure 2 A hyperbola

Like the ellipse, the hyperbola can also be defined as a set of points in the coordinate plane. A hyperbola is the set of all

points  in a plane such that the difference of the distances between     and the foci is a positive constant.

Notice that the definition of a hyperbola is very similar to that of an ellipse. The distinction is that the hyperbola is
defined in terms of the difference of two distances, whereas the ellipse is defined in terms of the sum of two distances.

As with the ellipse, every hyperbola has two axes of symmetry. The transverse axis is a line segment that passes
through the center of the hyperbola and has vertices as its endpoints. The foci lie on the line that contains the transverse
axis. The conjugate axis is perpendicular to the transverse axis and has the co-vertices as its endpoints. The center of a
hyperbola is the midpoint of both the transverse and conjugate axes, where they intersect. Every hyperbola also has
two asymptotes that pass through its center. As a hyperbola recedes from the center, its branches approach these
asymptotes. The central rectangle of the hyperbola is centered at the origin with sides that pass through each vertex
and co-vertex; it is a useful tool for graphing the hyperbola and its asymptotes. To sketch the asymptotes of the
hyperbola, simply sketch and extend the diagonals of the central rectangle. See Figure 3.

                                 Figure 3 Key features of the hyperbola

In this section, we will limit our discussion to hyperbolas that are positioned vertically or horizontally in the coordinate
plane; the axes will either lie on or be parallel to the x- and y-axes. We will consider two cases: those that are centered at
the origin, and those that are centered at a point other than the origin.

Deriving the Equation of a Hyperbola Centered at the Origin

Let     and  be the foci of a hyperbola centered at the origin. The hyperbola is the set of all points  such

that the difference of the distances from          to the foci is constant. See Figure 4.

these distances is for the vertex  It follows that                 for any point on the hyperbola. As with the

derivation of the equation of an ellipse, we will begin by applying the distance formula. The rest of the derivation is

     HOW TO

Given the equation of a hyperbola in standard form, locate its vertices and foci.

1. Determine whether the transverse axis lies on the x- or y-axis. Notice that is always under the variable with
     the positive coefficient. So, if you set the other variable equal to zero, you can easily find the intercepts. In the
     case where the hyperbola is centered at the origin, the intercepts coincide with the vertices.

a. If the equation has the form         then the transverse axis lies on the x-axis. The vertices are

located at                 and the foci are located at

b. If the equation has the form         then the transverse axis lies on the y-axis. The vertices are

Writing Equations of Hyperbolas in Standard Form

Just as with ellipses, writing the equation for a hyperbola in standard form allows us to calculate the key features: its
center, vertices, co-vertices, foci, asymptotes, and the lengths and positions of the transverse and conjugate axes.
Conversely, an equation for a hyperbola can be found given its key features. We begin by finding standard equations for
hyperbolas centered at the origin. Then we will turn our attention to finding standard equations for hyperbolas centered
at some point other than the origin.

Hyperbolas Centered at the Origin

Reviewing the standard forms given for hyperbolas centered at  we see that the vertices, co-vertices, and foci are

related by the equation                 Note that this equation can also be rewritten as         This relationship is

Solving Applied Problems Involving Hyperbolas

As we discussed at the beginning of this section, hyperbolas have real-world applications in many fields, such as
astronomy, physics, engineering, and architecture. The design efficiency of hyperbolic cooling towers is particularly
interesting. Cooling towers are used to transfer waste heat to the atmosphere and are often touted for their ability to
generate power efficiently. Because of their hyperbolic form, these structures are able to withstand extreme winds while
requiring less material than any other forms of their size and strength. See Figure 10. For example, a 500-foot tower can
be made of a reinforced concrete shell only 6 or 8 inches wide!

    Figure 10 Cooling towers at the Drax power station in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom (credit: Les Haines, Flickr)

The first hyperbolic towers were designed in 1914 and were 35 meters high. Today, the tallest cooling towers are in
France, standing a remarkable 170 meters tall. In Example 6 we will use the design layout of a cooling tower to find a
hyperbolic equation that models its sides.

       The design layout of a cooling tower is shown in Figure 11. The tower stands 179.6 meters tall. The diameter of the top is
       72 meters. At their closest, the sides of the tower are 60 meters apart.

Find the equation of the hyperbola that models the sides of the cooling tower. Assume that the center of the
hyperbola--indicated by the intersection of dashed perpendicular lines in the figure--is the origin of the coordinate
plane. Round final values to four decimal places.

     Solution
We are assuming the center of the tower is at the origin, so we can use the standard form of a horizontal hyperbola

centered at the origin:          where the branches of the hyperbola form the sides of the cooling tower. We must

find the values of and to complete the model.

First, we find Recall that the length of the transverse axis of a hyperbola is This length is represented by the

distance where the sides are closest, which is given as meters. So,  Therefore,              and

To solve for we need to substitute for and in our equation using a known point. To do this, we can use the

dimensions of the tower to find some point  that lies on the hyperbola. We will use the top right corner of the tower

to represent that point. Since the y-axis bisects the tower, our x-value can be represented by the radius of the top, or 36

meters. The y-value is represented by the distance from the origin to the top, which is given as 79.6 meters. Therefore,

The sides of the tower can be modeled by the hyperbolic equation

       Figure 1 Katherine Johnson's pioneering mathematical work in the area of parabolic and other orbital calculations
       played a significant role in the development of U.S space flight. (credit: NASA)
       Katherine Johnson is the pioneering NASA mathematician who was integral to the successful and safe flight and return
       of many human missions as well as satellites. Prior to the work featured in the movie Hidden Figures, she had already
       made major contributions to the space program. She provided trajectory analysis for the Mercury mission, in which Alan
       Shepard became the first American to reach space, and she and engineer Ted Sopinski authored a monumental paper
       regarding placing an object in a precise orbital position and having it return safely to Earth. Many of the orbits she
       determined were made up of parabolas, and her ability to combine different types of math enabled an unprecedented
       level of precision. Johnson said, "You tell me when you want it and where you want it to land, and I'll do it backwards and
       tell you when to take off."
       Johnson's work on parabolic orbits and other complex mathematics resulted in successful orbits, Moon landings, and
       the development of the Space Shuttle program. Applications of parabolas are also critical to other areas of science.
       Parabolic mirrors (or reflectors) are able to capture energy and focus it to a single point. The advantages of this property
       are evidenced by the vast list of parabolic objects we use every day: satellite dishes, suspension bridges, telescopes,
       microphones, spotlights, and car headlights, to name a few. Parabolic reflectors are also used in alternative energy
       devices, such as solar cookers and water heaters, because they are inexpensive to manufacture and need little
       maintenance. In this section we will explore the parabola and its uses, including low-cost, energy-efficient solar designs.

     Graphing Parabolas with Vertices at the Origin

       In The Ellipse, we saw that an ellipse is formed when a plane cuts through a right circular cone. If the plane is parallel to
       the edge of the cone, an unbounded curve is formed. This curve is a parabola. See Figure 2.

                                   Figure 2 Parabola

Like the ellipse and hyperbola, the parabola can also be defined by a set of points in the coordinate plane. A parabola is

the set of all points  in a plane that are the same distance from a fixed line, called the directrix, and a fixed point

(the focus) not on the directrix.

In Quadratic Functions (http://openstax.org/books/precalculus-2e/pages/3-3-power-functions-and-polynomial-
functions), we learned about a parabola's vertex and axis of symmetry. Now we extend the discussion to include other
key features of the parabola. See Figure 3. Notice that the axis of symmetry passes through the focus and vertex and is
perpendicular to the directrix. The vertex is the midpoint between the directrix and the focus.

The line segment that passes through the focus and is parallel to the directrix is called the latus rectum. The endpoints
of the latus rectum lie on the curve. By definition, the distance from the focus to any point on the parabola is equal
to the distance from to the directrix.

                                                          Figure 3 Key features of the parabola

To work with parabolas in the coordinate plane, we consider two cases: those with a vertex at the origin and those with a
vertex at a point other than the origin. We begin with the former.
996 8 · Analytic Geometry

                                                   Figure 4

Let        be a point on the parabola with vertex  focus             and directrix  as shown in Figure 4. The

distance from point              to point  on the directrix is the difference of the y-values:        The distance from

the focus  to the point            is also equal to and can be expressed using the distance formula.

Set the two expressions for equal to each other and solve for to derive the equation of the parabola. We do this

because the distance from          to      equals the distance from  to

We then square both sides of the equation, expand the squared terms, and simplify by combining like terms.

The equations of parabolas with vertex     are     when the x-axis is the axis of symmetry and              when

the y-axis is the axis of symmetry. These standard forms are given below, along with their general graphs and key

features.

The key features of a parabola are its vertex, axis of symmetry, focus, directrix, and latus rectum. See Figure 5. When
given a standard equation for a parabola centered at the origin, we can easily identify the key features to graph the
parabola.

A line is said to be tangent to a curve if it intersects the curve at exactly one point. If we sketch lines tangent to the
parabola at the endpoints of the latus rectum, these lines intersect on the axis of symmetry, as shown in Figure 6.

     Solution                                                      Thus, the axis of symmetry is parallel to

Graph                              Identify and label the vertex, axis of symmetry, focus, directrix, and endpoints of the

latus rectum.

     Solution
Start by writing the equation of the parabola in standard form. The standard form that applies to the given equation is

                               Thus, the axis of symmetry is parallel to the y-axis. To express the equation of the parabola in this
form, we begin by isolating the terms that contain the variable in order to complete the square.

It follows that:

· the vertex is

· the axis of symmetry is

· since                     and so the parabola opens up

· the coordinates of the focus are

· the equation of the directrix is

Solving Applied Problems Involving Parabolas

As we mentioned at the beginning of the section, parabolas are used to design many objects we use every day, such as
telescopes, suspension bridges, microphones, and radar equipment. Parabolic mirrors, such as the one used to light the
Olympic torch, have a very unique reflecting property. When rays of light parallel to the parabola's axis of symmetry are
directed toward any surface of the mirror, the light is reflected directly to the focus. See Figure 12. This is why the
Olympic torch is ignited when it is held at the focus of the parabolic mirror.

Parabolic mirrors have the ability to focus the sun's energy to a single point, raising the temperature hundreds of
degrees in a matter of seconds. Thus, parabolic mirrors are featured in many low-cost, energy efficient solar products,
such as solar cookers, solar heaters, and even travel-sized fire starters.

  EXAMPLE 6

Solving Applied Problems Involving Parabolas
A cross-section of a design for a travel-sized solar fire starter is shown in Figure 13. The sun's rays reflect off the
parabolic mirror toward an object attached to the igniter. Because the igniter is located at the focus of the parabola, the
reflected rays cause the object to burn in just seconds.

 Find the equation of the parabola that models the fire starter. Assume that the vertex of the parabolic mirror is the

origin of the coordinate plane.

 Use the equation found in part  to find the depth of the fire starter.

                   Figure 13 Cross-section of a travel-sized solar fire starter

Solution

 The vertex of the dish is the origin of the coordinate plane, so the parabola will take the standard form
where     The igniter, which is the focus, is 1.7 inches above the vertex of the dish. Thus we have

 The dish extends  inches on either side of the origin. We can substitute 2.25 for  in the equation from

part (a) to find the depth of the dish.

The dish is about 0.74 inches deep.

                            placed 320 mm from the base.

As we have seen, conic sections are formed when a plane intersects two right circular cones aligned tip to tip and
extending infinitely far in opposite directions, which we also call a cone. The way in which we slice the cone will
determine the type of conic section formed at the intersection. A circle is formed by slicing a cone with a plane
perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the cone. An ellipse is formed by slicing a single cone with a slanted plane not
perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. A parabola is formed by slicing the plane through the top or bottom of the
double-cone, whereas a hyperbola is formed when the plane slices both the top and bottom of the cone. See Figure 1.

Ellipses, circles, hyperbolas, and parabolas are sometimes called the nondegenerate conic sections, in contrast to the
degenerate conic sections, which are shown in Figure 2. A degenerate conic results when a plane intersects the double
cone and passes through the apex. Depending on the angle of the plane, three types of degenerate conic sections are
possible: a point, a line, or two intersecting lines.

Identifying Nondegenerate Conics in General Form

In previous sections of this chapter, we have focused on the standard form equations for nondegenerate conic sections.
In this section, we will shift our focus to the general form equation, which can be used for any conic. The general form is
set equal to zero, and the terms and coefficients are given in a particular order, as shown below.

where  and are not all zero. We can use the values of the coefficients to identify which type conic is represented

by a given equation.

You may notice that the general form equation has an term that we have not seen in any of the standard form
equations. As we will discuss later, the term rotates the conic whenever is not equal to zero.

            HOW TO

Given the equation of a conic, identify the type of conic.

1. Rewrite the equation in the general form,
2. Identify the values of and from the general form.

      a. If and are nonzero, have the same sign, and are not equal to each other, then the graph may be an
            ellipse.

      b. If and are equal and nonzero and have the same sign, then the graph may be a circle.
      c. If and are nonzero and have opposite signs, then the graph may be a hyperbola.
      d. If either or is zero, then the graph may be a parabola.

If B = 0, the conic section will have a vertical and/or horizontal axes. If B does not equal 0, as shown below, the

conic section is rotated. Notice the phrase "may be" in the definitions. That is because the equation may not

represent a conic section at all, depending on the values of A, B, C, D, E, and F. For example, the degenerate case

of a circle or an ellipse is a point:

                    when A and B have the same sign.

The degenerate case of a hyperbola is two intersecting straight lines:   when A and B have

opposite signs.

On the other hand, the equation,                                         when A and B are positive does not represent a graph at

Finding a New Representation of the Given Equation after Rotating through a Given Angle

Until now, we have looked at equations of conic sections without an term, which aligns the graphs with the x- and

y-axes. When we add an term, we are rotating the conic about the origin. If the x- and y-axes are rotated through an

angle, say then every point on the plane may be thought of as having two representations:      on the Cartesian

plane with the original x-axis and y-axis, and      on the new plane defined by the new, rotated axes, called the

x'-axis and y'-axis. See Figure 3.

rotating the axes. To do so, we will rewrite the general form as an equation in the and coordinate system without

Learning Objectives

In this section, you will:
           Identify a conic in polar form.
           Graph the polar equations of conics.
           Define conics in terms of a focus and a directrix.

Most of us are familiar with orbital motion, such as the motion of a planet around the sun or an electron around an
atomic nucleus. Within the planetary system, orbits of planets, asteroids, and comets around a larger celestial body are
often elliptical. Comets, however, may take on a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit instead. And, in reality, the characteristics
of the planets' orbits may vary over time. Each orbit is tied to the location of the celestial body being orbited and the
distance and direction of the planet or other object from that body. As a result, we tend to use polar coordinates to
represent these orbits.

In an elliptical orbit, the periapsis is the point at which the two objects are closest, and the apoapsis is the point at which
they are farthest apart. Generally, the velocity of the orbiting body tends to increase as it approaches the periapsis and
decrease as it approaches the apoapsis. Some objects reach an escape velocity, which results in an infinite orbit. These
bodies exhibit either a parabolic or a hyperbolic orbit about a body; the orbiting body breaks free of the celestial body's
gravitational pull and fires off into space. Each of these orbits can be modeled by a conic section in the polar coordinate
system.

Identifying a Conic in Polar Form

Any conic may be determined by three characteristics: a single focus, a fixed line called the directrix, and the ratio of the

        distances of each to a point on the graph. Consider the parabola

                                  Figure 2

In The Parabola, we learned how a parabola is defined by the focus (a fixed point) and the directrix (a fixed line). In this

section, we will learn how to define any conic in the polar coordinate system in terms of a fixed point, the focus       at

the pole, and a line, the directrix, which is perpendicular to the polar axis.

If is a fixed point, the focus, and is a fixed line, the directrix, then we can let be a fixed positive number, called the
eccentricity, which we can define as the ratio of the distances from a point on the graph to the focus and the point on

the graph to the directrix. Then the set of all points such that            is a conic. In other words, we can define a conic

as the set of all points with the property that the ratio of the distance from to to the distance from to is equal
to the constant

For a conic with eccentricity

· if  the conic is a parabola

· if  the conic is an hyperbola

With this definition, we may now define a conic in terms of the directrix,      the eccentricity    and the angle   Thus,

each conic may be written as a polar equation, an equation written in terms of and

Graphing the Polar Equations of Conics

When graphing in Cartesian coordinates, each conic section has a unique equation. This is not the case when graphing in

polar coordinates. We must use the eccentricity of a conic section to determine which type of curve to graph, and then

determine its specific characteristics. The first step is to rewrite the conic in standard form as we have done in the

previous example. In other words, we need to rewrite the equation so that the denominator begins with 1. This enables

us to determine and, therefore, the shape of the curve. The next step is to substitute values for and solve for to plot

a few key points. Setting equal to            and provides the vertices so we can create a rough sketch of the graph.

Key Concepts

8.1 The Ellipse

· An ellipse is the set of all points   in a plane such that the sum of their distances from two fixed points is a

constant. Each fixed point is called a focus (plural: foci).

· When given the coordinates of the foci and vertices of an ellipse, we can write the equation of the ellipse in standard

form. See Example 1 and Example 2.

· When given an equation for an ellipse centered at the origin in standard form, we can identify its vertices, co-

vertices, foci, and the lengths and positions of the major and minor axes in order to graph the ellipse. See Example 3

and Example 4.

· When given the equation for an ellipse centered at some point other than the origin, we can identify its key features

and graph the ellipse. See Example 5 and Example 6.

· Real-world situations can be modeled using the standard equations of ellipses and then evaluated to find key

features, such as lengths of axes and distance between foci. See Example 7.

8.2 The Hyperbola

· A hyperbola is the set of all points    in a plane such that the difference of the distances between      and the

foci is a positive constant.

· The standard form of a hyperbola can be used to locate its vertices and foci. See Example 1.

· When given the coordinates of the foci and vertices of a hyperbola, we can write the equation of the hyperbola in

standard form. See Example 2 and Example 3.

· When given an equation for a hyperbola, we can identify its vertices, co-vertices, foci, asymptotes, and lengths and

positions of the transverse and conjugate axes in order to graph the hyperbola. See Example 4 and Example 5.

· Real-world situations can be modeled using the standard equations of hyperbolas. For instance, given the

dimensions of a natural draft cooling tower, we can find a hyperbolic equation that models its sides. See Example 6.

8.3 The Parabola

· A parabola is the set of all points     in a plane that are the same distance from a fixed line, called the directrix,

and a fixed point (the focus) not on the directrix.

· The standard form of a parabola with vertex           and the x-axis as its axis of symmetry can be used to graph the

    the parabola. If             the parabola opens right. If  the parabola opens left. See Example 4.

    · The standard form of a parabola with vertex              and axis of symmetry parallel to the y-axis can be used to graph

    the parabola. If             the parabola opens up. If     the parabola opens down. See Example 5.

    · Real-world situations can be modeled using the standard equations of parabolas. For instance, given the diameter

    and focus of a cross-section of a parabolic reflector, we can find an equation that models its sides. See Example 6.

    · Four basic shapes can result from the intersection of a plane with a pair of right circular cones connected tail to tail.

    They include an ellipse, a circle, a hyperbola, and a parabola.

    · A nondegenerate conic section has the general form                                 where                and are

    · An expression is described as invariant if it remains unchanged after rotating. Because the discriminant is invariant,

    observing it enables us to identify the conic section. See Example 5.

8.5 Conic Sections in Polar Coordinates

    · Any conic may be determined by a single focus, the corresponding eccentricity, and the directrix. We can also define

    a conic in terms of a fixed point, the focus            at the pole, and a line, the directrix, which is perpendicular to the

    polar axis.

    · A conic is the set of all points      where eccentricity is a positive real number. Each conic may be written in

        terms of its polar equation. See Example 1.
    · The polar equations of conics can be graphed. See Example 2, Example 3, and Example 4.
    · Conics can be defined in terms of a focus, a directrix, and eccentricity. See Example 5 and Example 6.

    · We can use the identities                                and         to convert the equation for a conic from

    polar to rectangular form. See Example 7.

      Introduction to Sequences, Probability and Counting Theory

A lottery winner has some big decisions to make regarding what to do with the winnings. Buy a new home? A luxury
convertible? A cruise around the world?

The likelihood of winning the lottery is slim, but we all love to fantasize about what we could buy with the winnings. One
of the first things a lottery winner has to decide is whether to take the winnings in the form of a lump sum or as a series
of regular payments, called an annuity, over an extended period of time.

This decision is often based on many factors, such as tax implications, interest rates, and investment strategies. There
are also personal reasons to consider when making the choice, and one can make many arguments for either decision.
However, most lottery winners opt for the lump sum.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematics behind situations such as these. We will take an in-depth look at
annuities. We will also look at the branch of mathematics that would allow us to calculate the number of ways to choose
lottery numbers and the probability of winning.

This ordered list of numbers 27, 24.3, 21.87, 19.68, ... is a sequence. Each number in the list is a term.

A sequence is a function whose domain is the counting numbers. A sequence may have an infinite number of terms or a
finite number of terms. Our sequence has three dots (ellipsis) at the end which indicates the list never ends. If the
domain is the set of all counting numbers, then the sequence is an infinite sequence.

Often when working with sequences we do not want to write out all the terms. We want a more compact way to show

how each term is defined. When we worked with functions, we wrote                and we said the expression 2x was the

rule that defined values in the range.

While a sequence is a function, we do not use the usual function notation. Instead of writing the function as           ,

we would write it as             . The is the nth term of the sequence, the term in the nth position where n is a value in

the domain. The formula for writing the nth term of the sequence is called the general term or formula of the sequence.

General sequence terms are denoted as follows:

Sometimes we have a few terms of a sequence and it would be helpful to know the general term or nth term. To find
the general term, we look for patterns in the terms. Often the patterns involve multiples or powers. We also look for a

first five terms of this sequence are 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.
Listing all of the terms for a sequence can be cumbersome. For example, finding the number of hits on the website at
the end of the month would require listing out as many as 31 terms. A more efficient way to determine a specific term is
by writing a formula to define the sequence.
One type of formula is an explicit formula, which defines the terms of a sequence using their position in the sequence.
Explicit formulas are helpful if we want to find a specific term of a sequence without finding all of the previous terms. We
can use the formula to find the nth term of the sequence, where is any positive number. In our example, each number
in the sequence is double the previous number, so we can use powers of 2 to write a formula for the term.

The first term of the sequence is  the second term is     the third term is  and so on. The term of

the sequence can be found by raising 2 to the power. An explicit formula for a sequence is named by a lower case

letter  with the subscript The explicit formula for this sequence is

Now that we have a formula for the term of the sequence, we can answer the question posed at the beginning of this
section. We were asked to find the number of hits at the end of the month, which we will take to be 31 days. To find the
number of hits on the last day of the month, we need to find the 31st term of the sequence. We will substitute 31 for in
the formula.

If the doubling trend continues, the company will get     hits on the last day of the month. That is over 2.1

billion hits! The huge number is probably a little unrealistic because it does not take consumer interest and competition

into account. It does, however, give the company a starting point from which to consider business decisions.

Another way to represent the sequence is by using a table. The first five terms of the sequence and the  term of the
sequence are shown in Table 2.

                                                          123 4 5

                                   term of the sequence,  2 4 8 16 32

        Table 2

Graphing provides a visual representation of the sequence as a set of distinct points. We can see from the graph in
Figure 1 that the number of hits is rising at an exponential rate. This particular sequence forms an exponential function.

                                                      Figure 1

Lastly, we can write this particular sequence as

A sequence that continues indefinitely is called an infinite sequence. The domain of an infinite sequence is the set of
counting numbers. If we consider only the first 10 terms of the sequence, we could write

This sequence is called a finite sequence because it does not continue indefinitely.

  Sequence

  A sequence is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. A finite sequence is a sequence whose domain
  consists of only the first positive integers. The numbers in a sequence are called terms. The variable with a
  number subscript is used to represent the terms in a sequence and to indicate the position of the term in the
  sequence.

  We call the first term of the sequence, the second term of the sequence, the third term of the sequence, and
  so on. The term is called the nth term of the sequence, or the general term of the sequence. An explicit formula
  defines the term of a sequence using the position of the term. A sequence that continues indefinitely is an
  infinite sequence.

Q&A  Does a sequence always have to begin with

     No. In certain problems, it may be useful to define the initial term as  instead of  In these problems,

Investigating Alternating Sequences

Sometimes sequences have terms that are alternate. In fact, the terms may actually alternate in sign. The steps to
finding terms of the sequence are the same as if the signs did not alternate. However, the resulting terms will not show
increase or decrease as increases. Let's take a look at the following sequence.

Notice the first term is greater than the second term, the second term is less than the third term, and the third term is
greater than the fourth term. This trend continues forever. Do not rearrange the terms in numerical order to interpret
the sequence.

We've learned that sequences are functions whose domain is over the positive integers. This is true for other types of

subsections. A different formula might represent each individual subsection.

Finding an Explicit Formula

Thus far, we have been given the explicit formula and asked to find a number of terms of the sequence. Sometimes, the
explicit formula for the term of a sequence is not given. Instead, we are given several terms from the sequence.
When this happens, we can work in reverse to find an explicit formula from the first few terms of a sequence. The key to
finding an explicit formula is to look for a pattern in the terms. Keep in mind that the pattern may involve alternating
terms, formulas for numerators, formulas for denominators, exponents, or bases.

             ...

                 HOW TO

Writing the Terms of a Sequence Defined by a Recursive Formula

Sequences occur naturally in the growth patterns of nautilus shells, pinecones, tree branches, and many other natural
structures. We may see the sequence in the leaf or branch arrangement, the number of petals of a flower, or the pattern
of the chambers in a nautilus shell. Their growth follows the Fibonacci sequence, a famous sequence in which each term
can be found by adding the preceding two terms. The numbers in the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,.... Other
examples from the natural world that exhibit the Fibonacci sequence are the Calla Lily, which has just one petal, the
Black-Eyed Susan with 13 petals, and different varieties of daisies that may have 21 or 34 petals.

Each term of the Fibonacci sequence depends on the terms that come before it. The Fibonacci sequence cannot easily be
written using an explicit formula. Instead, we describe the sequence using a recursive formula, a formula that defines
the terms of a sequence using previous terms.

A recursive formula always has two parts: the value of an initial term (or terms), and an equation defining  in terms of
preceding terms. For example, suppose we know the following:

We can find the subsequent terms of the sequence using the first term.

So the first four terms of the sequence are  .

The recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence states the first two terms and defines each successive term as the sum
1056 9 · Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory

        of the preceding two terms.

To find the tenth term of the sequence, for example, we would need to add the eighth and ninth terms. We were told
previously that the eighth and ninth terms are 21 and 34, so

Recursive Formula

A recursive formula is a formula that defines each term of a sequence using preceding term(s). Recursive formulas
must always state the initial term, or terms, of the sequence.

Q&A  Must the first two terms always be given in a recursive formula?

     No. The Fibonacci sequence defines each term using the two preceding terms, but many recursive
     formulas define each term using only one preceding term. These sequences need only the first term to be
     defined.

...

     HOW TO

Given a recursive formula with only the first term provided, write the first terms of a sequence.

Companies often make large purchases, such as computers and vehicles, for business use. The book-value of these
supplies decreases each year for tax purposes. This decrease in value is called depreciation. One method of calculating
depreciation is straight-line depreciation, in which the value of the asset decreases by the same amount each year.
As an example, consider a woman who starts a small contracting business. She purchases a new truck for $25,000. After
five years, she estimates that she will be able to sell the truck for $8,000. The loss in value of the truck will therefore be
$17,000, which is $3,400 per year for five years. The truck will be worth $21,600 after the first year; $18,200 after two
years; $14,800 after three years; $11,400 after four years; and $8,000 at the end of five years. In this section, we will
consider specific kinds of sequences that will allow us to calculate depreciation, such as the truck's value.

Finding Common Differences

The values of the truck in the example are said to form an arithmetic sequence because they change by a constant
amount each year. Each term increases or decreases by the same constant value called the common difference of the
sequence. For this sequence, the common difference is -3,400.

The sequence below is another example of an arithmetic sequence. In this case, the constant difference is 3. You can
choose any term of the sequence, and add 3 to find the subsequent term.

Arithmetic Sequence

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence that has the property that the difference between any two consecutive terms
is a constant. This constant is called the common difference. If is the first term of an arithmetic sequence and is
the common difference, the sequence will be:

EXAMPLE 1

Finding Common Differences
Is each sequence arithmetic? If so, find the common difference.

  Solution  

Subtract each term from the subsequent term to determine whether a common difference exists.

 The sequence is not arithmetic because there is no common difference.
1068 9 · Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory

     The sequence is arithmetic because there is a common difference. The common difference is 4.

             Analysis
        The graph of each of these sequences is shown in Figure 1. We can see from the graphs that, although both sequences
        show growth, is not linear whereas is linear. Arithmetic sequences have a constant rate of change so their graphs will
        always be points on a line.

                                 Figure 1

Q&A  If we are told that a sequence is arithmetic, do we have to subtract every term from the following
     term to find the common difference?

     No. If we know that the sequence is arithmetic, we can choose any one term in the sequence, and subtract
     it from the subsequent term to find the common difference.

Writing Terms of Arithmetic Sequences

Now that we can recognize an arithmetic sequence, we will find the terms if we are given the first term and the common
difference. The terms can be found by beginning with the first term and adding the common difference repeatedly. In
addition, any term can also be found by plugging in the values of and into formula below.

Using Recursive Formulas for Arithmetic Sequences

Some arithmetic sequences are defined in terms of the previous term using a recursive formula. The formula provides
an algebraic rule for determining the terms of the sequence. A recursive formula allows us to find any term of an
arithmetic sequence using a function of the preceding term. Each term is the sum of the previous term and the common
difference. For example, if the common difference is 5, then each term is the previous term plus 5. As with any recursive
formula, the first term must be given.

Recursive Formula for an Arithmetic Sequence

              HOW TO

Q&A           Do we have to subtract the first term from the second term to find the common difference?

              No. We can subtract any term in the sequence from the subsequent term. It is, however, most common to
              subtract the first term from the second term because it is often the easiest method of finding the
              common difference.

TRY IT #5 Write a recursive formula for the arithmetic sequence.

Using Explicit Formulas for Arithmetic Sequences

We can think of an arithmetic sequence as a function on the domain of the natural numbers; it is a linear function
because it has a constant rate of change. The common difference is the constant rate of change, or the slope of the
function. We can construct the linear function if we know the slope and the vertical intercept.

To find the y-intercept of the function, we can subtract the common difference from the first term of the sequence.
Consider the following sequence.

The common difference is , so the sequence represents a linear function with a slope of . To find the

-intercept, we subtract from                            . You can also find the -intercept by graphing

the function and determining where a line that connects the points would intersect the vertical axis. The graph is shown

in Figure 4.

                                              Figure 4

Recall the slope-intercept form of a line is  When dealing with sequences, we use in place of and in

place of If we know the slope and vertical intercept of the function, we can substitute them for and in the slope-

intercept form of a line. Substituting for the slope and for the vertical intercept, we get the following equation:
1072 9 · Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory

formula for this sequence is                          , which simplifies to

Many jobs offer an annual cost-of-living increase to keep salaries consistent with inflation. Suppose, for example, a
recent college graduate finds a position as a sales manager earning an annual salary of $26,000. He is promised a 2%
cost of living increase each year. His annual salary in any given year can be found by multiplying his salary from the
previous year by 102%. His salary will be $26,520 after one year; $27,050.40 after two years; $27,591.41 after three years;
and so on. When a salary increases by a constant rate each year, the salary grows by a constant factor. In this section, we
will review sequences that grow in this way.

Finding Common Ratios

The yearly salary values described form a geometric sequence because they change by a constant factor each year.
Each term of a geometric sequence increases or decreases by a constant factor called the common ratio. The sequence
below is an example of a geometric sequence because each term increases by a constant factor of 6. Multiplying any
term of the sequence by the common ratio 6 generates the subsequent term.

Definition of a Geometric Sequence

A geometric sequence is one in which any term divided by the previous term is a constant. This constant is called the
common ratio of the sequence. The common ratio can be found by dividing any term in the sequence by the
previous term. If is the initial term of a geometric sequence and is the common ratio, the sequence will be

              HOW TO

Given a set of numbers, determine if they represent a geometric sequence.
 1. Divide each term by the previous term.
 2. Compare the quotients. If they are the same, a common ratio exists and the sequence is geometric.

1084 9 · Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory

             Solution
        Divide each term by the previous term to determine whether a common ratio exists.

    

        The sequence is geometric because there is a common ratio. The common ratio is 2.

    

        The sequence is not geometric because there is not a common ratio.
             Analysis

        The graph of each sequence is shown in Figure 1. It seems from the graphs that both (a) and (b) appear have the form of
        the graph of an exponential function in this viewing window. However, we know that (a) is geometric and so this
        interpretation holds, but (b) is not.

Q&A  If you are told that a sequence is geometric, do you have to divide every term by the previous term
     to find the common ratio?

     No. If you know that the sequence is geometric, you can choose any one term in the sequence and divide
     it by the previous term to find the common ratio.

Writing Terms of Geometric Sequences

Now that we can identify a geometric sequence, we will learn how to find the terms of a geometric sequence if we are

given the first term and the common ratio. The terms of a geometric sequence can be found by beginning with the first

term and multiplying by the common ratio repeatedly. For instance, if the first term of a geometric sequence is

and the common ratio is          we can find subsequent terms by multiplying  to get then multiplying the result

to get and so on.

Using Recursive Formulas for Geometric Sequences

A recursive formula allows us to find any term of a geometric sequence by using the previous term. Each term is the
product of the common ratio and the previous term. For example, suppose the common ratio is 9. Then each term is
nine times the previous term. As with any recursive formula, the initial term must be given.

  Recursive Formula for a Geometric Sequence

  The recursive formula for a geometric sequence with common ratio and first term is

             ...

                 HOW TO

  Given the first several terms of a geometric sequence, write its recursive formula.
   1. State the initial term.
   2. Find the common ratio by dividing any term by the preceding term.
   3. Substitute the common ratio into the recursive formula for a geometric sequence.

1086 9 · Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory

             Solution
        The first term is given as 6. The common ratio can be found by dividing the second term by the first term.

        Substitute the common ratio into the recursive formula for geometric sequences and define

             Analysis
        The sequence of data points follows an exponential pattern. The common ratio is also the base of an exponential
        function as shown in Figure 2

                                                 Figure 2

Q&A  Do we have to divide the second term by the first term to find the common ratio?

     No. We can divide any term in the sequence by the previous term. It is, however, most common to divide
     the second term by the first term because it is often the easiest method of finding the common ratio.

Using Explicit Formulas for Geometric Sequences

Because a geometric sequence is an exponential function whose domain is the set of positive integers, and the common
ratio is the base of the function, we can write explicit formulas that allow us to find particular terms.

Let's take a look at the sequence                This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2 and

an exponential function with a base of 2. An explicit formula for this sequence is

pays 6% annual interest, compounded monthly. How much money will they have saved when their daughter is ready to
start college in 6 years? In this section, we will learn how to answer this question. To do so, we need to consider the
amount of money invested and the amount of interest earned.

Using Summation Notation

To find the total amount of money in the college fund and the sum of the amounts deposited, we need to add the
amounts deposited each month and the amounts earned monthly. The sum of the terms of a sequence is called a series.
Consider, for example, the following series.

The nth partial sum of a series is the sum of a finite number of consecutive terms beginning with the first term. The

Summation notation is used to represent series. Summation notation is often known as sigma notation because it uses
the Greek capital letter sigma, to represent the sum. Summation notation includes an explicit formula and specifies
the first and last terms in the series. An explicit formula for each term of the series is given to the right of the sigma. A
variable called the index of summation is written below the sigma. The index of summation is set equal to the lower
limit of summation, which is the number used to generate the first term in the series. The number above the sigma,
called the upper limit of summation, is the number used to generate the last term in a series.

If we interpret the given notation, we see that it asks us to find the sum of the terms in the series  for

through  We can begin by substituting the terms for and listing out the terms of this series.

We can find the sum of the series by adding the terms:

Using the Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series

Thus far, we have looked only at finite series. Sometimes, however, we are interested in the sum of the terms of an
infinite sequence rather than the sum of only the first terms. An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite
sequence. An example of an infinite series is

                                                                                  where the upper limit of summation is infinity. Because
This series can also be written in summation notation as

the terms are not tending to zero, the sum of the series increases without bound as we add more terms. Therefore, the
sum of this infinite series is not defined. When the sum is not a real number, we say the series diverges.

Determining Whether the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series is Defined

If the terms of an infinite geometric sequence approach 0, the sum of an infinite geometric series can be defined. The
terms in this series approach 0:

The common ratio          As gets very large, the values of get very small and approach 0. Each successive term

affects the sum less than the preceding term. As each succeeding term gets closer to 0, the sum of the terms

approaches a finite value. The terms of any infinite geometric series with          approach 0; the sum of a geometric

series is defined when

       HOW TO

Given the first several terms of an infinite series, determine if the sum of the series exists.

1. Find the ratio of the second term to the first term.

2. Find the ratio of the third term to the second term.

3. Continue this process to ensure the ratio of a term to the preceding term is constant throughout. If so, the series

  is geometric.

4. If a common ratio, was found in step 3, check to see if                        . If so, the sum is defined. If not, the sum is

Finding Sums of Infinite Series

When the sum of an infinite geometric series exists, we can calculate the sum. The formula for the sum of an infinite
series is related to the formula for the sum of the first terms of a geometric series.

Looking for a pattern, we rewrite the sum, noticing that we see the first term multiplied to 0.1 in the second term, and
the second term multiplied to 0.1 in the third term.

Notice the pattern; we multiply each consecutive term by a common ratio of 0.1 starting with the first term of 0.3. So,

Solving Annuity Problems

At the beginning of the section, we looked at a problem in which a parent invested a set amount of money each month
into a college fund for six years. An annuity is an investment in which the purchaser makes a sequence of periodic,
equal payments. To find the amount of an annuity, we need to find the sum of all the payments and the interest earned.
In the example, the parent invests $50 each month. This is the value of the initial deposit. The account paid 6% annual
interest, compounded monthly. To find the interest rate per payment period, we need to divide the 6% annual
percentage interest (APR) rate by 12. So the monthly interest rate is 0.5%. We can multiply the amount in the account
each month by 100.5% to find the value of the account after interest has been added.

We can find the value of the annuity right after the last deposit by using a geometric series with     and

                     After the first deposit, the value of the annuity will be $50. Let us see if we can determine the

amount in the college fund and the interest earned.

We can find the value of the annuity after deposits using the formula for the sum of the first      terms of a geometric
                                                                                                          into the formula,
series. In 6 years, there are 72 months, so           We can substitute

and simplify to find the value of the annuity after 6 years.

After the last deposit, the parent will have a total of $4,320.44 in the account. Notice, the parent made 72 payments of

$50 each for a total of          This means that because of the annuity, the parent earned $720.44 interest in

their college fund.

     HOW TO

Given an initial deposit and an interest rate, find the value of an annuity.

1. Determine the value of the initial deposit.
2. Determine the number of deposits.
3. Determine

      a. Divide the annual interest rate by the number of times per year that interest is compounded.

Learning Objectives

           Solve counting problems using the addition principle.
           Solve counting problems using the multiplication principle.

Objective 1: Solve counting problems using the addition principle.

In probability theory, an outcome is a possible result of an experiment or trial.

In probability theory, an event is a set of outcomes of an experiment.

Disjoint events cannot happen at the same time. In other words, they are mutually exclusive.

  The Addition Principle

  The Addition Principle states that if one event can occur in A ways (A outcomes) and a second event can occur in B
  ways (B outcomes) and both events cannot occur at the same time (A and B disjoints) then there are A + B ways (A+B
  outcomes) for the first event or the second event to occur.

The addition principle applies when we are making only one selection.

  EXAMPLE 1

Solve counting problems using the addition principle.

 Seven red and five green marbles are placed in a bag. How many marbles are there to choose from?
 Let the set A = {-5,-3,-1,2,3,4,5,6}. How many ways are there to choose a negative or an even number from A?
 A student is shopping for a new computer. He is deciding among 2 desktop computers and 3 laptop computers.

What is the total number of computer options?

     Solution

 There are 7 ways of picking a red marble and 5 ways of picking a green marble and we cannot pick a red and a
1110 9 · Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory

green at the same time. Therefore, there are 7+5 = 12 ways of picking a marble.

 There are 3 negative numbers in A and 3 even numbers in A and the even numbers are not negative. Therefore,

there are 3+3 = 6 ways of choosing a negative or an even number from A.

 There are 2 options for a desktop and 3 options for a laptop and the student is shopping for one computer. So, he

cannot pick both. Therefore, there are 2+3 = 5 total computer options.

3. A young boy is deciding on a snack for the afternoon. He is deciding among 5 different chips, 3 different fruits and
    2 different vegetables. What is the total number of snack options?

Objective 2: Solve counting problems using the multiplication principle.

  The Multiplication Principle

The Multiplication Principle states that if one event can occur in A ways (A outcomes) and a second event can occur

in B ways (B outcomes) after the first event has occurred then the two events can occur in  ways. This is also

known as the Fundamental Counting Principle.

The Multiplication Principle applies when we are making more than one selection.

A new company sells customizable cases for tablets and smartphones. Each case comes in a variety of colors and can be
personalized for an additional fee with images or a monogram. A customer can choose not to personalize or could
choose to have one, two, or three images or a monogram. The customer can choose the order of the images and the
letters in the monogram. The company is working with an agency to develop a marketing campaign with a focus on the
huge number of options they offer. Counting the possibilities is challenging!
We encounter a wide variety of counting problems every day. There is a branch of mathematics devoted to the study of
counting problems such as this one. Other applications of counting include secure passwords, horse racing outcomes,
and college scheduling choices. We will examine this type of mathematics in this section.

Using the Addition Principle

The company that sells customizable cases offers cases for tablets and smartphones. There are 3 supported tablet
models and 5 supported smartphone models. The Addition Principle tells us that we can add the number of tablet
options to the number of smartphone options to find the total number of options. By the Addition Principle, there are 8
total options, as we can see in Figure 1.

The Addition Principle

According to the Addition Principle, if one event can occur in ways and a second event with no common outcomes

can occur in ways, then the first or second event can occur in  ways.

  EXAMPLE 1

Using the Addition Principle
There are 2 vegetarian entrée options and 5 meat entrée options on a dinner menu. What is the total number of entrée
options?

     Solution
We can add the number of vegetarian options to the number of meat options to find the total number of entrée options.

There are 7 total options.

           laptop computers. What is the total number of computer options?

Using the Multiplication Principle

The Multiplication Principle applies when we are making more than one selection. Suppose we are choosing an
appetizer, an entrée, and a dessert. If there are 2 appetizer options, 3 entrée options, and 2 dessert options on a fixed-
price dinner menu, there are a total of 12 possible choices of one each as shown in the tree diagram in Figure 2.

The possible choices are:

 1. soup, chicken, cake
 2. soup, chicken, pudding
 3. soup, fish, cake
 4. soup, fish, pudding
 5. soup, steak, cake
 6. soup, steak, pudding
 7. salad, chicken, cake
 8. salad, chicken, pudding
 9. salad, fish, cake
10. salad, fish, pudding
11. salad, steak, cake
12. salad, steak, pudding

We can also find the total number of possible dinners by multiplying.

We could also conclude that there are 12 possible dinner choices simply by applying the Multiplication Principle.

The Multiplication Principle

According to the Multiplication Principle, if one event can occur in  ways and a second event can occur in ways
after the first event has occurred, then the two events can occur in      ways. This is also known as the
Fundamental Counting Principle.

  EXAMPLE 2

Using the Multiplication Principle
Diane packed 2 skirts, 4 blouses, and a sweater for her business trip. She will need to choose a skirt and a blouse for
each outfit and decide whether to wear the sweater. Use the Multiplication Principle to find the total number of possible

     Solution
To find the total number of outfits, find the product of the number of skirt options, the number of blouse options, and
the number of sweater options.

There are 16 possible outfits.

Finding the Number of Permutations of n Distinct Objects

The Multiplication Principle can be used to solve a variety of problem types. One type of problem involves placing objects
in order. We arrange letters into words and digits into numbers, line up for photographs, decorate rooms, and more. An
ordering of objects is called a permutation.

Finding the Number of Permutations of n Distinct Objects Using the Multiplication Principle

To solve permutation problems, it is often helpful to draw line segments for each option. That enables us to determine
the number of each option so we can multiply. For instance, suppose we have four paintings, and we want to find the
number of ways we can hang three of the paintings in order on the wall. We can draw three lines to represent the three
places on the wall.

There are four options for the first place, so we write a 4 on the first line.

After the first place has been filled, there are three options for the second place so we write a 3 on the second line.

After the second place has been filled, there are two options for the third place so we write a 2 on the third line. Finally,
we find the product.

There are 24 possible permutations of the paintings.

             ...

                 HOW TO

  Given distinct options, determine how many permutations there are.

   1. Determine how many options there are for the first situation.
   2. Determine how many options are left for the second situation.
   3. Continue until all of the spots are filled.
   4. Multiply the numbers together.

  EXAMPLE 3

Finding the Number of Permutations Using the Multiplication Principle
At a swimming competition, nine swimmers compete in a race.

 How many ways can they place first, second, and third?
 How many ways can they place first, second, and third if a swimmer named Ariel wins first place? (Assume there

is only one contestant named Ariel.)

 How many ways can all nine swimmers line up for a photo?

     Solution

 Draw lines for each place.

There are 9 options for first place. Once someone has won first place, there are 8 remaining options for second place.
Once first and second place have been won, there are 7 remaining options for third place.

Multiply to find that there are 504 ways for the swimmers to place.

 Draw lines for describing each place.

We know Ariel must win first place, so there is only 1 option for first place. There are 8 remaining options for second
place, and then 7 remaining options for third place.

Multiply to find that there are 56 ways for the swimmers to place if Ariel wins first.



Draw lines for describing each place in the photo.

There are 9 choices for the first spot, then 8 for the second, 7 for the third, 6 for the fourth, and so on until only 1 person
remains for the last spot.

There are 362,880 possible permutations for the swimmers to line up.

     Analysis                                                                                            distinct objects
Note that in part c, we found there were 9! ways for 9 people to line up. The number of permutations of

A family of five is having portraits taken. Use the Multiplication Principle to find the following.
       TRY IT #3 How many ways can the family line up for the portrait?

TRY IT #4 How many ways can the photographer line up 3 family members?

TRY IT #5        How many ways can the family line up for the portrait if the parents are required to stand on each
                 end?

Finding the Number of Permutations of n Distinct Objects Using a Formula

For some permutation problems, it is inconvenient to use the Multiplication Principle because there are so many

numbers to multiply. Fortunately, we can solve these problems using a formula. Before we learn the formula, let's look

at two common notations for permutations. If we have a set of objects and we want to choose objects from the set in

order, we write  Another way to write this is       a notation commonly seen on computers and calculators. To

calculate        we begin by finding the number of ways to line up all objects. We then divide by        to cancel

out the      items that we do not wish to line up.

Let's see how this works with a simple example. Imagine a club of six people. They need to elect a president, a vice
president, and a treasurer. Six people can be elected president, any one of the five remaining people can be elected vice
president, and any of the remaining four people could be elected treasurer. The number of ways this may be done is

                        Using factorials, we get the same result.

There are 120 ways to select 3 officers in order from a club with 6 members. We refer to this as a permutation of 6 taken
3 at a time. The general formula is as follows.

Note that the formula stills works if we are choosing all objects and placing them in order. In that case we would be

dividing by      or which we said earlier is equal to 1. So the number of permutations of objects taken at a

time is or just

arrange the questions?

Solution

Substitute  and                  into the permutation formula and simplify.

There are 79,833,600 possible permutations of exam questions!

Analysis

We can also use a calculator to find permutations. For this problem, we would enter 12, press the      function, enter 9,

and then press the equal sign. The        function may be located under the MATH menu with probability commands.

Q&A         Could we have solved Example 4 using the Multiplication Principle?

            Yes. We could have multiplied                                    to find the same answer.

A play has a cast of 7 actors preparing to make their curtain call. Use the permutation formula to find the following.
       TRY IT #6 How many ways can the 7 actors line up?

TRY IT #7 How many ways can 5 of the 7 actors be chosen to line up?

Find the Number of Combinations Using the Formula

So far, we have looked at problems asking us to put objects in order. There are many problems in which we want to

select a few objects from a group of objects, but we do not care about the order. When we are selecting objects and the

order does not matter, we are dealing with combinations. A selection of objects from a set of objects where the

order does not matter can be written as    Just as with permutations,        can also be written as    In this

case, the general formula is as follows.

An earlier problem considered choosing 3 of 4 possible paintings to hang on a wall. We found that there were 24 ways to

select 3 of the 4 paintings in order. But what if we did not care about the order? We would expect a smaller number

because selecting paintings 1, 2, 3 would be the same as selecting paintings 2, 3, 1. To find the number of ways to select

3 of the 4 paintings, disregarding the order of the paintings, divide the number of permutations by the number of ways

to order 3 paintings. There are  ways to order 3 paintings. There are or 4 ways to select 3 of the 4

paintings. This number makes sense because every time we are selecting 3 paintings, we are not selecting 1 painting.
There are 4 paintings we could choose not to select, so there are 4 ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings.

Formula for Combinations of n Distinct Objects

Given distinct objects, the number of ways to select objects from the set is

           ...

              HOW TO

Given a number of options, determine the possible number of combinations.

 1. Identify from the given information.
 2. Identify from the given information.
 3. Replace and in the formula with the given values.
 4. Evaluate.

EXAMPLE 5

Finding the Number of Combinations Using the Formula
A fast food restaurant offers five side dish options. Your meal comes with two side dishes.

 How many ways can you select your side dishes?    How many ways can you select 3 side dishes?
                                                   We want to choose 3 side dishes from 5 options.
     Solution

 We want to choose 2 side dishes from 5 options.

Analysis

We can also use a graphing calculator to find combinations. Enter 5, then press  enter 3, and then press the equal

sign. The  function may be located under the MATH menu with probability commands.

Q&A        Is it a coincidence that parts (a) and (b) in Example 5 have the same answers?

           No. When we choose r objects from n objects, we are not choosing      objects. Therefore,

TRY IT #8  An ice cream shop offers 10 flavors of ice cream. How many ways are there to choose 3 flavors for
           a banana split?

Finding the Number of Subsets of a Set

We have looked only at combination problems in which we chose exactly objects. In some problems, we want to
consider choosing every possible number of objects. Consider, for example, a pizza restaurant that offers 5 toppings.
Any number of toppings can be ordered. How many different pizzas are possible?

To answer this question, we need to consider pizzas with any number of toppings. There is    way to order a
1118 9 · Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory

pizza with no toppings. There are                     ways to order a pizza with exactly one topping. If we continue this process,
we get

There are 32 possible pizzas. This result is equal to
We are presented with a sequence of choices. For each of the objects we have two choices: include it in the subset or
not. So for the whole subset we have made choices, each with two options. So there are a total of
possible resulting subsets, all the way from the empty subset, which we obtain when we say "no" each time, to the
original set itself, which we obtain when we say "yes" each time.

  Formula for the Number of Subsets of a Set

  A set containing n distinct objects has subsets.

EXAMPLE 6

Finding the Number of Subsets of a Set
A restaurant offers butter, cheese, chives, and sour cream as toppings for a baked potato. How many different ways are
there to order a potato?

     Solution                                                                 into the formula.
We are looking for the number of subsets of a set with 4 objects. Substitute

There are 16 possible ways to order a potato.

TRY IT #9  A sundae bar at a wedding has 6 toppings to choose from. Any number of toppings can be
           chosen. How many different sundaes are possible?

Finding the Number of Permutations of n Non-Distinct Objects

We have studied permutations where all of the objects involved were distinct. What happens if some of the objects are
indistinguishable? For example, suppose there is a sheet of 12 stickers. If all of the stickers were distinct, there would be

     ways to order the stickers. However, 4 of the stickers are identical stars, and 3 are identical moons. Because all of the
objects are not distinct, many of the permutations we counted are duplicates. The general formula for this situation
is as follows.

In this example, we need to divide by the number of ways to order the 4 stars and the ways to order the 3 moons to find
the number of unique permutations of the stickers. There are ways to order the stars and ways to order the moon.

There are 3,326,400 ways to order the sheet of stickers.

Objective 1: Use Pascal's Triangle to expand a binomial. (IA 12.4.1)

Pascal's triangle helps us find the coefficients of the terms in the expansion of a binomial.
To find the coefficients of the terms, we write our expansion again focusing on the coefficients. We rewrite the
coefficients to the right forming an array of coefficients. The array to the right is called Pascal's Triangle.

Notice that in each expansion the powers of a in each term decrease from n to 0, and the powers of b increase from 0 to
n.

Notice each number in the array is the sum of the two closest numbers in the row above. We can find the next row by
starting and ending with one and then adding two adjacent numbers.

To find the coefficients of the expansion of the binomial  , go to the row that has the value n as a second entry.

A polynomial with two terms is called a binomial. We have already learned to multiply binomials and to raise binomials

to powers, but raising a binomial to a high power can be tedious and time-consuming. In this section, we will discuss a

shortcut that will allow us to find     without multiplying the binomial by itself times.

Identifying Binomial Coefficients

In Counting Principles, we studied combinations. In the shortcut to finding  we will need to use combinations to

find the coefficients that will appear in the expansion of the binomial. In this case, we use the notation  instead of

  but it can be calculated in the same way. So

The combination  is called a binomial coefficient. An example of a binomial coefficient is

Binomial Coefficients                                then the binomial coefficient is
If and are integers greater than or equal to 0 with

  Q&A      Is a binomial coefficient always a whole number?

           Yes. Just as the number of combinations must always be a whole number, a binomial coefficient will
           always be a whole number.

  Analysis

Notice that we obtained the same result for parts (b) and (c). If you look closely at the solution for these two parts, you

will see that you end up with the same two factorials in the denominator, but the order is reversed, just as with

combinations.

Using the Binomial Theorem

When we expand          by multiplying, the result is called a binomial expansion, and it includes binomial coefficients.

If we wanted to expand            we might multiply   by itself fifty-two times. This could take hours! If we

examine some simple binomial expansions, we can find patterns that will lead us to a shortcut for finding more

complicated binomial expansions.

First, let's examine the exponents. With each successive term, the exponent for decreases and the exponent for
increases. The sum of the two exponents is for each term.
Next, let's examine the coefficients. Notice that the coefficients increase and then decrease in a symmetrical pattern. The
coefficients follow a pattern:

These patterns lead us to the Binomial Theorem, which can be used to expand any binomial.

Another way to see the coefficients is to examine the expansion of a binomial in general form,  to successive
powers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

See Figure 1, which illustrates the following:

· There are  terms in the expansion of

· The degree (or sum of the exponents) for each term is

· The powers on begin with and decrease to 0.

· The powers on begin with 0 and increase to

· The coefficients are symmetric.

To determine the expansion on       we see      thus, there will be 5+1 = 6 terms. Each term has a combined

degree of 5. In descending order for powers of the pattern is as follows:

· Introduce  and then for each successive term reduce the exponent on by 1 until   is reached.
· Introduce       and then increase the exponent on by 1 until is reached.

The next expansion would be

But where do those coefficients come from? The binomial coefficients are symmetric. We can see these coefficients in an
array known as Pascal's Triangle, shown in Figure 2. Pascal didn't invent the triangle. The underlying principles had been
developed and written about for over 1500 years, first by the Indian mathematician (and poet) Pingala in the second
century BCE. Others throughout Asia and Europe worked with the concepts throughout, and the triangle was first
published in its graphical form by Omar Khayyam, an Iranian mathematician and astronomer, for whom the triangle is
named in Iran. French mathematician Blaise Pascal repopularized it when he republished it and used it to solve a
number of probability problems.

                                                Figure 2

To generate Pascal's Triangle, we start by writing a 1. In the row below, row 2, we write two 1's. In the 3rd row, flank the

ends of the rows with 1's, and add  to find the middle number, 2. In the row, flank the ends of the row with 1's.

Each element in the triangle is the sum of the two elements immediately above it.

To see the connection between Pascal's Triangle and binomial coefficients, let us revisit the expansion of the binomials

        Many events in life are inherently uncertain: will it snow tomorrow? Am I going to get an `A' in this course? None of
        these questions can be answered with certainty, however, we might say that some are unlikely, and others are more
        likely.
        The probability of an event is a description of how likely it is that an event will happen. A probability is a number
        between 0 and 1 (that is, between 0% and 100%), where probabilities closer to 100% are very likely to occur, and
        probabilities closer to 0% are very unlikely to occur. A probability of 0% means the event is impossible, and a probability
        of 100% means the event will certainly occur.
        A probability model is a mathematical description of an experiment listing all possible outcomes and their associated
        probabilities. It is defined by its sample space, events within the sample space, and probabilities associated with each
        event.
        The sample space S for a probability model is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, the sample space for rolling
        a dice is the set 1,2,3,4,5,6.This notation is referred to as roster notation.
        An event A is a subset of the sample space S. For example, the event "Rolling an even number" is the subset 2,4,6.
        To calculate the probability of an event, we divide the number of possible outcomes of the event by the number of
        possible outcomes of the sample space.

        It is important to note that in order to use this formula, all outcomes must be equally likely to happen.
        For example, the probability of rolling an even number with a standard dice is:

 Find the probability of "Drawing an Ace."

     Solution
Tossing a coin:

 When you toss a coin, there are two outcomes. The sample space is: Heads, Tails.
 There is only one outcome for the coin landing on heads, so P(Lands on Heads)=12.

Rolling a die:

 When you roll a dice, there are six outcomes. The event "Rolling an odd number" has three outcomes. The event is

set notation is: 1,3,5.

 P(rolling an odd number)=36=12.

Drawing a card:

 When you draw a card, there are 52 outcomes. The event "Drawing an Ace" has four outcomes. The event in set

notation is:Ace of hearts, Ace of diamonds, Ace of clubs, Ace of spades.

 P(Drawing an Ace)=452=113.

      Figure 1 An example of a "spaghetti model," which can be used to predict possible paths of a tropical storm.1

Residents of the Southeastern United States are all too familiar with charts, known as spaghetti models, such as the one
in Figure 1. They combine a collection of weather data to predict the most likely path of a hurricane. Each colored line
represents one possible path. The group of squiggly lines can begin to resemble strands of spaghetti, hence the name.
In this section, we will investigate methods for making these types of predictions.

Constructing Probability Models

Suppose we roll a six-sided number cube. Rolling a number cube is an example of an experiment, or an activity with an
observable result. The numbers on the cube are possible results, or outcomes, of this experiment. The set of all possible
outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space of the experiment. The sample space for this experiment is

                       An event is any subset of a sample space.

The likelihood of an event is known as probability. The probability of an event is a number that always satisfies
               where 0 indicates an impossible event and 1 indicates a certain event. A probability model is a mathematical

description of an experiment listing all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. For instance, if there is a 1%
chance of winning a raffle and a 99% chance of losing the raffle, a probability model would look much like Table 1.

                                                      Outcome             Probability

                                                      Winning the raffle  1%

                                                      Losing the raffle   99%

                                                      Table 1

The sum of the probabilities listed in a probability model must equal 1, or 100%.

             ...

                 HOW TO

Given a probability event where each event is equally likely, construct a probability model.

 1. Identify every outcome.
 2. Determine the total number of possible outcomes.
 3. Compare each outcome to the total number of possible outcomes.

Construct a probability model for rolling a single, fair die, with the event being the number shown on the die.

Begin by making a list of all possible outcomes for the experiment. The possible outcomes are the numbers that can be
rolled: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are six possible outcomes that make up the sample space.
Assign probabilities to each outcome in the sample space by determining a ratio of the outcome to the number of
possible outcomes. There is one of each of the six numbers on the cube, and there is no reason to think that any
particular face is more likely to show up than any other one, so the probability of rolling any number is

outcomes of an experiment are all equally likely, we can find the probability of an event by dividing the number of
outcomes in the event by the total number of outcomes in Suppose a number cube is rolled, and we are interested in
finding the probability of the event "rolling a number less than or equal to 4." There are 4 possible outcomes in the

We are often interested in finding the probability that one of multiple events occurs. Suppose we are playing a card

game, and we will win if the next card drawn is either a heart or a king. We would be interested in finding the probability

of the next card being a heart or a king. The union of two events              is the event that occurs if

either or both events occur.

Events are said to be mutually exclusive events when they have no outcomes in common. Because there is no overlap,
there is nothing to subtract, so the general formula is

     Using the Complement Rule to Compute Probabilities

        We have discussed how to calculate the probability that an event will happen. Sometimes, we are interested in finding
       the probability that an event will not happen. The complement of an event denoted is the set of outcomes in the
        sample space that are not in For example, suppose we are interested in the probability that a horse will lose a race. If
        event is the horse winning the race, then the complement of event is the horse losing the race.
        To find the probability that the horse loses the race, we need to use the fact that the sum of all probabilities in a
        probability model must be 1.

        The probability of the horse winning added to the probability of the horse losing must be equal to 1. Therefore, if the
        probability of the horse winning the race is the probability of the horse losing the race is simply

          The Complement Rule

          The probability that the complement of an event will occur is given by

Two six-sided number cubes are rolled.

 Find the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is less than or equal to 3.
 Find the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is greater than 3.

     Solution

The first step is to identify the sample space, which consists of all the possible outcomes. There are two number cubes,

and each number cube has six possible outcomes. Using the Multiplication Principle, we find that there are  or

total possible outcomes. So, for example, 1-1 represents a 1 rolled on each number cube.

 We need to count the number of ways to roll a sum of 3 or less. These would include the following outcomes: 1-1,

 Rather than listing all the possibilities, we can use the Complement Rule. Because we have already found the

probability of the complement of this event, we can simply subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that
the sum of the numbers rolled is greater than 3.

Computing Probability Using Counting Theory

Many interesting probability problems involve counting principles, permutations, and combinations. In these problems,
we will use permutations and combinations to find the number of elements in events and sample spaces. These
problems can be complicated, but they can be made easier by breaking them down into smaller counting problems.

Assume, for example, that a store has 8 cellular phones and that 3 of those are defective. We might want to find the

probability that a couple purchasing 2 phones receives 2 phones that are not defective. To solve this problem, we need

to calculate all of the ways to select 2 phones that are not defective as well as all of the ways to select 2 phones. There

are 5 phones that are not defective, so there are  ways to select 2 phones that are not defective. There are 8

phones, so there are  ways to select 2 phones. The probability of selecting 2 phones that are not defective is:

 We need to count the number of ways to choose only bears and the total number of possible ways to select 5
toys. There are 6 bears, so there are  ways to choose 5 bears. There are 14 toys, so there are             ways to

choose any 5 toys.

 We need to count the number of ways to choose 2 bears and 3 dogs and the total number of possible ways to
select 5 toys. There are 6 bears, so there are     ways to choose 2 bears. There are 5 dogs, so there are

ways to choose 3 dogs. Since we are choosing both bears and dogs at the same time, we will use the Multiplication

Principle. There are                   ways to choose 2 bears and 3 dogs. We can use this result to find the probability.

 It is often easiest to solve "at least" problems using the Complement Rule. We will begin by finding the

probability that fewer than 2 dogs are chosen. If less than 2 dogs are chosen, then either no dogs could be chosen, or

1 dog could be chosen.

When no dogs are chosen, all 5 toys come from the 9 toys that are not dogs. There are    ways to choose toys

from the 9 toys that are not dogs. Since there are 14 toys, there are  ways to choose the 5 toys from all of the

toys.

If there is 1 dog chosen, then 4 toys must come from the 9 toys that are not dogs, and 1 must come from the 5 dogs.
Since we are choosing both dogs and other toys at the same time, we will use the Multiplication Principle. There are

                       ways to choose 1 dog and 1 other toy.

Because these events would not occur together and are therefore mutually exclusive, we add the probabilities to find
the probability that fewer than 2 dogs are chosen.

We then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that at least 2 dogs are chosen.

· Probability is always a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means an event is impossible and 1 means an event is
    certain.

· The probabilities in a probability model must sum to 1. See Example 1.
· When the outcomes of an experiment are all equally likely, we can find the probability of an event by dividing the

    number of outcomes in the event by the total number of outcomes in the sample space for the experiment. See

· To find the probability of the union of two events, we add the probabilities of the two events and subtract the
    probability that both events occur simultaneously. See Example 3.
· To find the probability of the union of two mutually exclusive events, we add the probabilities of each of the events.

1. Each output of a function
    must have exactly one
    output for the function to be
    one-to-one. If any horizontal
    line crosses the graph of a
    function more than once,
    that means that -values
    repeat and the function is
    not one-to-one. If no
    horizontal line crosses the
    graph of the function more
    than once, then no -values
    repeat and the function is
    one-to-one.
