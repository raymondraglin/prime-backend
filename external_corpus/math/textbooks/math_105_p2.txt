                      Quantitative Analysis
              of a Current Issue and Solutions

     Issues and Solutions Poster Fair: Monday, November 19th, 9-11:20 am
Extra Credit for coming to my other class: Monday, November 19th, 2-3:50 pm

Purpose
    To use critical thinking and quantitative analysis on a current, complex issue that is

         relevant to you.

    To educate our class and our campus community about your issue, what is being done or

         could be done, and empower our audience to help.

    To collaborate and work together with your teammates and approach the topic from

         many valuable perspectives.

Project Description

     Your team will be making a tri-fold poster to share with our campus community in the
         Great Hall. Friends and family are welcome during the poster fair.

     Your team will need one 36-inch x 48-inch tri-fold poster board (Please chip in $1-2).
     One way to make a poster is to make Google Slides (4:3 Standard Ratio, not widescreen)

         and then print them in color (in the computer lab on campus) and attach them to your
         poster board. I encourage you to use Google Slides because all group members can edit
         the slides online and I will make suggestions after you share them with me. If you have
         another way, I'm open to that. Be creative and artistic!

Guidelines

     The world we live in is very complex and while the public and politicians may like simple
         solutions, they are rarely adequate. Show the complexity of your topic and solutions that
         address many aspects.

     Report on your topic in an objective manner. Avoid judgment and placing blame.
         Consider the many viewpoints of our diverse audience.

     Be respectful of all viewpoints and experiences. Some topics are emotional and/or heavy
         and your team may disagree. The goal is to bring many viewpoints to this topic, which
         will make for a better poster.

     Discuss with your group how to approach the project. Make sure that each person is
         doing an equal share and that everyone is heard. If your group is not working well
         together please talk to each other about it. I will be happy to meet with your group for
         help or group problem solving.

     Be as descriptive as possible and label everything. Include units on all numbers. Write
         descriptions so that a person who is not in our class can understand the content.

     Graphs can be found or created using technology. You can copy and paste graphs from a
         spreadsheet into Google Slides.

Project Event

     For the entire class time we will set up a display in the Great Hall. Each group will have a
         table to place your poster board on.

     Some math classes will be coming by to learn about your topic and the fair will be open
         to all students, faculty and staff as well as your friends and family members.

     When there are slow times you can visit other groups to learn about their topic and they
         can visit you.

Items to include on your poster

       1. Issue Introduction

         Write a brief introduction of your issue, assuming your audience has no prior knowledge
         of the topic. Why is this a problem? Entice your audience to want to know more.

       2. Issue Context and Background Information

         Provide quantitative information and visuals about the issue, including many points of
         view. Explain who, what, where, when, why and how. Use images, graphs, charts and/or
         infographics to show the situation.

       3. At Least Two Visual Comparisons

         A single number or graph is not very meaningful without a basis for comparison. There
         are two main types of comparisons:

              The same quantity over time. (Examples: present vs. past or a time series graph)
              The same quantity for two different groups. (Examples: a pie chart of the U.S

                  compared with a pie chart of other countries, or a line graph showing data by
                  ethnicity)
         Include at least two visual comparisons with an explanation of each. Explain what your
         audience should notice from each graph or comparison.

       4. Solution(s)

         What is currently being done about this topic or issue? What groups are currently
         working on it? Describe as many solutions as possible. Add your own possible solutions.
         What would you like to see happen in the future?

       5. Action Steps for our Audience

         What are some specific actions that individuals in our audience can take to help the
         situation? Think of small and large action items. Be very specific so your audience knows
         what to do and how. Encourage and empower your audience to act.

       6. Sources

         Use at least three different sources for your poster that are relevant and useful to your
         audience. At least one source must be a local or national organization or a
         city/state/county government source. Use credible sources and cite them in APA format.

       7. Interesting Title and Poster Design

         Design an interesting poster layout with a large meaningful title. Make sure that your
         poster looks cohesive. The font and formatting should be the same throughout. The font
         size should be large enough so that people standing around your poster can read it.
