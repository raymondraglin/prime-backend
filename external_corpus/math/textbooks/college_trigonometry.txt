While the cover of this textbook lists only two names, the book as it stands today would simply
not exist if not for the tireless work and dedication of several people. First and foremost, we wish
to thank our families for their patience and support during the creative process. We would also
like to thank our students - the sole inspiration for the work. Among our colleagues, we wish to
thank Rich Basich, Bill Previts, and Irina Lomonosov, who not only were early adopters of the
textbook, but also contributed materials to the project. Special thanks go to Katie Cimperman,
Terry Dykstra, Frank LeMay, and Rich Hagen who provided valuable feedback from the classroom.
Thanks also to David Stumpf, Ivana Gorgievska, Jorge Gerszonowicz, Kathryn Arocho, Heather
Bubnick, and Florin Muscutariu for their unwaivering support (and sometimes defense) of the
book. From outside the classroom, we wish to thank Don Anthan and Ken White, who designed
the electric circuit applications used in the text, as well as Drs. Wendy Marley and Marcia Ballinger
for the Lorain CCC enrollment data used in the text. The authors are also indebted to the good
folks at our schools' bookstores, Gwen Sevtis (Lakeland CC) and Chris Callahan (Lorain CCC),
for working with us to get printed copies to the students as inexpensively as possible. We would
also like to thank Lakeland folks Jeri Dickinson, Mary Ann Blakeley, Jessica Novak, and Corrie
Bergeron for their enthusiasm and promotion of the project. The administrations at both schools
have also been very supportive of the project, so from Lakeland, we wish to thank Dr. Morris W.
Beverage, Jr., President, Dr. Fred Law, Provost, Deans Don Anthan and Dr. Steve Oluic, and the
Board of Trustees. From Lorain County Community College, we wish to thank Dr. Roy A. Church,
Dr. Karen Wells, and the Board of Trustees. From the Ohio Board of Regents, we wish to thank
former Chancellor Eric Fingerhut, Darlene McCoy, Associate Vice Chancellor of Affordability and
Efficiency, and Kelly Bernard. From OhioLINK, we wish to thank Steve Acker, John Magill, and
Stacy Brannan. We also wish to thank the good folks at WebAssign, most notably Chris Hall,
COO, and Joel Hollenbeck (former VP of Sales.) Last, but certainly not least, we wish to thank
all the folks who have contacted us over the interwebs, most notably Dimitri Moonen and Joel
Wordsworth, who gave us great feedback, and Antonio Olivares who helped debug the source code.

Preface

Thank you for your interest in our book, but more importantly, thank you for taking the time to
read the Preface. I always read the Prefaces of the textbooks which I use in my classes because
I believe it is in the Preface where I begin to understand the authors - who they are, what their
motivation for writing the book was, and what they hope the reader will get out of reading the
text. Pedagogical issues such as content organization and how professors and students should best
use a book can usually be gleaned out of its Table of Contents, but the reasons behind the choices
authors make should be shared in the Preface. Also, I feel that the Preface of a textbook should
demonstrate the authors' love of their discipline and passion for teaching, so that I come away
believing that they really want to help students and not just make money. Thus, I thank my fellow
Preface-readers again for giving me the opportunity to share with you the need and vision which
guided the creation of this book and passion which both Carl and I hold for Mathematics and the
teaching of it.

Carl and I are natives of Northeast Ohio. We met in graduate school at Kent State University
in 1997. I finished my Ph.D in Pure Mathematics in August 1998 and started teaching at Lorain
County Community College in Elyria, Ohio just two days after graduation. Carl earned his Ph.D in
Pure Mathematics in August 2000 and started teaching at Lakeland Community College in Kirtland,
Ohio that same month. Our schools are fairly similar in size and mission and each serves a similar
population of students. The students range in age from about 16 (Ohio has a Post-Secondary
Enrollment Option program which allows high school students to take college courses for free while
still in high school.) to over 65. Many of the "non-traditional" students are returning to school in
order to change careers. A majority of the students at both schools receive some sort of financial
aid, be it scholarships from the schools' foundations, state-funded grants or federal financial aid
like student loans, and many of them have lives busied by family and job demands. Some will
be taking their Associate degrees and entering (or re-entering) the workforce while others will be
continuing on to a four-year college or university. Despite their many differences, our students
share one common attribute: they do not want to spend $200 on a College Algebra book.

The challenge of reducing the cost of textbooks is one that many states, including Ohio, are taking
quite seriously. Indeed, state-level leaders have started to work with faculty from several of the
colleges and universities in Ohio and with the major publishers as well. That process will take
considerable time so Carl and I came up with a plan of our own. We decided that the best
way to help our students right now was to write our own College Algebra book and give it away
electronically for free. We were granted sabbaticals from our respective institutions for the Spring
x  Preface

semester of 2009 and actually began writing the textbook on December 16, 2008. Using an open-
source text editor called TexNicCenter and an open-source distribution of LaTeX called MikTex
2.7, Carl and I wrote and edited all of the text, exercises and answers and created all of the graphs
(using Metapost within LaTeX) for Version 0.9 in about eight months. (We choose to create a
text in only black and white to keep printing costs to a minimum for those students who prefer
a printed edition. This somewhat Spartan page layout stands in sharp relief to the explosion of
colors found in most other College Algebra texts, but neither Carl nor I believe the four-color
print adds anything of value.) I used the book in three sections of College Algebra at Lorain
County Community College in the Fall of 2009 and Carl's colleague, Dr. Bill Previts, taught a
section of College Algebra at Lakeland with the book that semester as well. Students had the
option of downloading the book as a .pdf file from our website www.stitz-zeager.com or buying a
low-cost printed version from our colleges' respective bookstores. (By giving this book away for
free electronically, we end the cycle of new editions appearing every 18 months to curtail the used
book market.) During Thanksgiving break in November 2009, many additional exercises written
by Dr. Previts were added and the typographical errors found by our students and others were
corrected. On December 10, 2009, Version 2 was released. The book remains free for download at
our website and by using Lulu.com as an on-demand printing service, our bookstores are now able
to provide a printed edition for just under $19. Neither Carl nor I have, or will ever, receive any
royalties from the printed editions. As a contribution back to the open-source community, all of
the LaTeX files used to compile the book are available for free under a Creative Commons License
on our website as well. That way, anyone who would like to rearrange or edit the content for their
classes can do so as long as it remains free.

The only disadvantage to not working for a publisher is that we don't have a paid editorial staff.
What we have instead, beyond ourselves, is friends, colleagues and unknown people in the open-
source community who alert us to errors they find as they read the textbook. What we gain in not
having to report to a publisher so dramatically outweighs the lack of the paid staff that we have
turned down every offer to publish our book. (As of the writing of this Preface, we've had three
offers.) By maintaining this book by ourselves, Carl and I retain all creative control and keep the
book our own. We control the organization, depth and rigor of the content which means we can resist
the pressure to diminish the rigor and homogenize the content so as to appeal to a mass market.
A casual glance through the Table of Contents of most of the major publishers' College Algebra
books reveals nearly isomorphic content in both order and depth. Our Table of Contents shows a
different approach, one that might be labeled "Functions First." To truly use The Rule of Four,
that is, in order to discuss each new concept algebraically, graphically, numerically and verbally, it
seems completely obvious to us that one would need to introduce functions first. (Take a moment
and compare our ordering to the classic "equations first, then the Cartesian Plane and THEN
functions" approach seen in most of the major players.) We then introduce a class of functions
and discuss the equations, inequalities (with a heavy emphasis on sign diagrams) and applications
which involve functions in that class. The material is presented at a level that definitely prepares a
student for Calculus while giving them relevant Mathematics which can be used in other classes as
well. Graphing calculators are used sparingly and only as a tool to enhance the Mathematics, not
to replace it. The answers to nearly all of the computational homework exercises are given in the
                                                                                                                               xi

text and we have gone to great lengths to write some very thought provoking discussion questions
whose answers are not given. One will notice that our exercise sets are much shorter than the
traditional sets of nearly 100 "drill and kill" questions which build skill devoid of understanding.
Our experience has been that students can do about 15-20 homework exercises a night so we very
carefully chose smaller sets of questions which cover all of the necessary skills and get the students
thinking more deeply about the Mathematics involved.
Critics of the Open Educational Resource movement might quip that "open-source is where bad
content goes to die," to which I say this: take a serious look at what we offer our students. Look
through a few sections to see if what we've written is bad content in your opinion. I see this open-
source book not as something which is "free and worth every penny", but rather, as a high quality
alternative to the business as usual of the textbook industry and I hope that you agree. If you have
any comments, questions or concerns please feel free to contact me at jeff@stitz-zeager.com or Carl
at carl@stitz-zeager.com.

Foundations of Trigonometry

10.1 Angles and their Measure

This section begins our study of Trigonometry and to get started, we recall some basic definitions
from Geometry. A ray is usually described as a `half-line' and can be thought of as a line segment
in which one of the two endpoints is pushed off infinitely distant from the other, as pictured below.
The point from which the ray originates is called the initial point of the ray.

                                                                   P

                                               A ray with initial point P .

When two rays share a common initial point they form an angle and the common initial point is
called the vertex of the angle. Two examples of what are commonly thought of as angles are

                          Q

                    P     An angle with vertex Q.

An angle with vertex P .

However, the two figures below also depict angles - albeit these are, in some sense, extreme cases.
In the first case, the two rays are directly opposite each other forming what is known as a straight
angle; in the second, the rays are identical so the `angle' is indistinguishable from the ray itself.

                                                                                                                          Q
                                        P

                   A straight angle.

The measure of an angle is a number which indicates the amount of rotation that separates the
rays of the angle. There is one immediate problem with this, as pictured below.
694                                                                  Foundations of Trigonometry

Which amount of rotation are we attempting to quantify? What we have just discovered is that
we have at least two angles described by this diagram.1 Clearly these two angles have different
measures because one appears to represent a larger rotation than the other, so we must label them
differently. In this book, we use lower case Greek letters such as  (alpha),  (beta),  (gamma)
and  (theta) to label angles. So, for instance, we have

                                                             

One commonly used system to measure angles is degree measure. Quantities measured in degrees

are denoted by the familiar `' symbol. One complete revolution as shown below is 360, and parts

of a revolution are measured proportionately.2 Thus half of a revolution (a straight angle) measures

1  (360)  =  180,  a  quarter  of  a  revolution  (a  right  angle)  measures  1  (360)  =  90  and  so  on.
2                                                                              4

   One revolution  360                                180                                       90

Note that in the above figure, we have used the small square ` ' to denote a right angle, as is
commonplace in Geometry. Recall that if an angle measures strictly between 0 and 90 it is called
an acute angle and if it measures strictly between 90 and 180 it is called an obtuse angle.
It is important to note that, theoretically, we can know the measure of any angle as long as we

    1The phrase `at least' will be justified in short order.
    2The choice of `360' is most often attributed to the Babylonians.
10.1 Angles and their Measure                                                                                             695

know the proportion it represents of entire revolution.3 For instance, the measure of an angle which

represents  a  rotation   of  2   of  a  revolution  would    measure  2  (360)   =  240,       the  measure      of  an  angle
                              3                                        3
                              1                                    112 (360)     30
which  constitutes     only   12  of  a  revolution  measures                 =      and    an   angle     which      indicates

no rotation at all is measured as 0.

               240                                            30                                           0

Using our definition of degree measure, we have that 1 represents the measure of an angle which

constitutes    1   of  a  revolution.    Even  though     it  may  be  hard  to  draw,  it  is  nonetheless   not     difficult
              360
to imagine an angle with measure smaller than 1. There are two ways to subdivide degrees. The

first, and most familiar, is decimal degrees. For example, an angle with a measure of 30.5 would

represent  a  rotation    halfway     between  30    and  31,  or  equivalently,  30.5  =   61   of  a  full  rotation.   This
                                                                                  360       720
                                                                                 
can be taken to the limit using Calculus so that measures like 2 make sense. The second way             4

to divide degrees is the Degree - Minute - Second (DMS) system. In this system, one degree is

divided equally into sixty minutes, and in turn, each minute is divided equally into sixty seconds.5

In symbols, we write 1 = 60 and 1 = 60 , from which it follows that 1 = 3600 . To convert a

measure of 42.125 to the DMS system, we start by noting that 42.125 = 42 + 0.125. Converting

the partial amount of degrees to minutes, we find 0.125                   60     = 7.5 = 7 + 0.5 . Converting the
                                                                          1

partial amount of minutes to seconds gives 0.5                60   = 30 . Putting it all together yields
                                                               1

                                         42.125 = 42 + 0.125
                                                     = 42 + 7.5
                                                     = 42 + 7 + 0.5
                                                     = 42 + 7 + 30
                                                     = 427 30

On the other hand, to convert 11715 45 to decimal degrees, we first compute 15                                1   = 41  and
                                                                                                              60
45 3600 1 = 801 . Then we find

                                           11715 45 = 117 + 15 + 45

                                                            = 117 + 41  + 801 
                                                            = 80 9381 
                                                            = 117.2625

Recall that two acute angles are called complementary angles if their measures add to 90.
Two angles, either a pair of right angles or one acute angle and one obtuse angle, are called
supplementary angles if their measures add to 180. In the diagram below, the angles  and 
are supplementary angles while the pair  and  are complementary angles.

In practice, the distinction between the angle itself and its measure is blurred so that the sentence
` is an angle measuring 42' is often abbreviated as ` = 42.' It is now time for an example.

Example 10.1.1. Let  = 111.371 and  = 3728 17 .

1. Convert  to the DMS system. Round your answer to the nearest second.
2. Convert  to decimal degrees. Round your answer to the nearest thousandth of a degree.
3. Sketch  and .
4. Find a supplementary angle for .
5. Find a complementary angle for .

Solution.

1. To convert  to the DMS system, we start with 111.371 = 111 + 0.371. Next we convert

     0.371 601  = 22.26 . Writing 22.26 = 22 + 0.26 , we convert 0.26                          60  = 15.6 . Hence,
                                                                                                1

                                            111.371 = 111 + 0.371
                                                          = 111 + 22.26
                                                          = 111 + 22 + 0.26
                                                          = 111 + 22 + 15.6
                                                          = 11122 15.6

     Rounding to seconds, we obtain   11122 16 .
10.1 Angles and their Measure                                  697

2. To convert  to decimal degrees, we convert 28 601 = 157  and 17 3600 1 = 3600 17 . Putting
   it all together, we have

3728 17                        = 37 + 28 + 17

                               = 37 + 157  + 3600 17 
                               = 3600 134897 
                                37.471

3. To sketch , we first note that 90 <  < 180. If we divide this range in half, we get
   90 <  < 135, and once more, we have 90 <  < 112.5. This gives us a pretty good
   estimate for , as shown below.6 Proceeding similarly for , we find 0 <  < 90, then
   0 <  < 45, 22.5 <  < 45, and lastly, 33.75 <  < 45.

Angle                                                  Angle 

4. To find a supplementary angle for , we seek an angle  so that  +  = 180. We get
    = 180 -  = 180 - 111.371 = 68.629.

5. To find a complementary angle for , we seek an angle  so that  +  = 90. We get
    = 90 -  = 90 - 3728 17 . While we could reach for the calculator to obtain an
   approximate answer, we choose instead to do a bit of sexagesimal7 arithmetic. We first
   rewrite 90 = 900 0 = 8960 0 = 8959 60 . In essence, we are `borrowing' 1 = 60
   from the degree place, and then borrowing 1 = 60 from the minutes place.8 This yields,
    = 90 - 3728 17 = 8959 60 - 3728 17 = 5231 43 .

Up to this point, we have discussed only angles which measure between 0 and 360, inclusive.
Ultimately, we want to use the arsenal of Algebra which we have stockpiled in Chapters 1 through
9 to not only solve geometric problems involving angles, but also to extend their applicability to
other real-world phenomena. A first step in this direction is to extend our notion of `angle' from
merely measuring an extent of rotation to quantities which can be associated with real numbers.
To that end, we introduce the concept of an oriented angle. As its name suggests, in an oriented

    6If this process seems hauntingly familiar, it should. Compare this method to the Bisection Method introduced
in Section 3.3.

    7Like `latus rectum,' this is also a real math term.
    8This is the exact same kind of `borrowing' you used to do in Elementary School when trying to find 300 - 125.
Back then, you were working in a base ten system; here, it is base sixty.
698                              Foundations of Trigonometry

angle, the direction of the rotation is important. We imagine the angle being swept out starting
from an initial side and ending at a terminal side, as shown below. When the rotation is
counter-clockwise9 from initial side to terminal side, we say that the angle is positive; when the
rotation is clockwise, we say that the angle is negative.

                            ide                 Initial Side
                       al S                 T
                     in
                 erm                          er
               T                                m
                                                  inal
                 Initial Side                           Sid
                                                           e
     A positive angle, 45
                                 A negative angle, -45

At this point, we also extend our allowable rotations to include angles which encompass more than
one revolution. For example, to sketch an angle with measure 450 we start with an initial side,
rotate counter-clockwise one complete revolution (to take care of the `first' 360) then continue
with an additional 90 counter-clockwise rotation, as seen below.

                                                              450

To further connect angles with the Algebra which has come before, we shall often overlay an angle
diagram on the coordinate plane. An angle is said to be in standard position if its vertex is
the origin and its initial side coincides with the positive x-axis. Angles in standard position are
classified according to where their terminal side lies. For instance, an angle in standard position
whose terminal side lies in Quadrant I is called a `Quadrant I angle'. If the terminal side of an
angle lies on one of the coordinate axes, it is called a quadrantal angle. Two angles in standard
position are called coterminal if they share the same terminal side.10 In the figure below,  = 120
and  = -240 are two coterminal Quadrant II angles drawn in standard position. Note that
 =  + 360, or equivalently,  =  - 360. We leave it as an exercise to the reader to verify that
coterminal angles always differ by a multiple of 360.11 More precisely, if  and  are coterminal
angles, then  =  + 360 · k where k is an integer.12

    9`widdershins'
  10Note that by being in standard position they automatically share the same initial side which is the positive x-axis.
  11It is worth noting that all of the pathologies of Analytic Trigonometry result from this innocuous fact.
  12Recall that this means k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . ..

according to where their terminal side lies. Find three coterminal angles, at least one of which is
positive and one of which is negative.

Solution.

1. To graph  = 60, we draw an angle with its initial side on the positive x-axis and rotate
                       60
    counter-clockwise  360         =  1  of a revolution.          We see that   is a Quadrant I angle.  To find angles
                                      6
    which are coterminal, we look for angles  of the form  =  + 360 · k, for some integer k.

    When k = 1, we get  = 60+360 = 420. Substituting k = -1 gives  = 60-360 = -300.

    Finally, if we let k = 2, we get  = 60 + 720 = 780.

2.  Since    = -225  is  negative,       we  start  at  the        positive  x-axis  and  rotate     clockwise  225  =  5  of

    a revolution. We see that  is a Quadrant II angle. To find coterminal angles, we proceed as

    before and compute  = -225 + 360 · k for integer values of k. We find 135, -585 and

    495 are all coterminal with -225.

3. Since  = 540 is positive, we rotate counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis. One full

     revolution accounts for 360,    with 180,     or    1  of a revolution remaining.    Since the terminal
                                                         2

     side of  lies on the negative x-axis,  is a quadrantal angle. All angles coterminal with  are

     of the form  = 540 + 360 · k, where k is an integer. Working through the arithmetic, we

     find three such angles: 180, -180 and 900.

4. The Greek letter  is pronounced `fee' or `fie' and since  is negative, we begin our rotation

     clockwise  from  the  positive  x-axis.  Two  full  revolutions  account  for  720,  with  just  30  or  1
                                                                                                              12

Note that since there are infinitely many integers, any given angle has infinitely many coterminal
angles, and the reader is encouraged to plot the few sets of coterminal angles found in Example
10.1.2 to see this. We are now just one step away from completely marrying angles with the real
numbers and the rest of Algebra. To that end, we recall this definition from Geometry.

 Definition 10.1. The real number  is defined to be the ratio of a circle's circumference to its
 diameter. In symbols, given a circle of circumference C and diameter d,

                                                            = C
                                                                   d

While Definition 10.1 is quite possibly the `standard' definition of , the authors would be remiss
if we didn't mention that buried in this definition is actually a theorem. As the reader is probably
aware, the number  is a mathematical constant - that is, it doesn't matter which circle is selected,
the ratio of its circumference to its diameter will have the same value as any other circle. While
this is indeed true, it is far from obvious and leads to a counterintuitive scenario which is explored
in the Exercises. Since the diameter of a circle is twice its radius, we can quickly rearrange the
equation in Definition 10.1 to get a formula more useful for our purposes, namely: 2 = C

                                                                                                                      r
10.1 Angles and their Measure                                              701

This tells us that for any circle, the ratio of its circumference to its radius is also always constant;
in this case the constant is 2. Suppose now we take a portion of the circle, so instead of comparing
the entire circumference C to the radius, we compare some arc measuring s units in length to the
radius, as depicted below. Let  be the central angle subtended by this arc, that is, an angle
whose vertex is the center of the circle and whose determining rays pass through the endpoints of

                                                                                                        s
the arc. Using proportionality arguments, it stands to reason that the ratio r should also be a
constant among all circles, and it is this ratio which defines the radian measure of an angle.

                                                 s

                                           
                               r

                                               r

                                             The radian measure of  is s .
                                                                                  r

To get a better feel for radian measure, we note that an angle with radian measure 1 means the
corresponding arc length s equals the radius of the circle r, hence s = r. When the radian measure
is 2, we have s = 2r; when the radian measure is 3, s = 3r, and so forth. Thus the radian measure
of an angle  tells us how many `radius lengths' we need to sweep out along the circle to subtend
the angle .

                                                                                           r

Since one revolution sweeps out the entire circumference 2r, one revolution has radian measure
2r = 2. From this we can find the radian measure of other central angles using proportions,

  r

just like we did with degrees. For instance, half of a revolution has radian measure 12 (2) = , a
quarter revolution has radian measure 14 (2) = 2 , and so forth. Note that, by definition, the radian
measure of an angle is a length divided by another length so that these measurements are actually
dimensionless and are considered `pure' numbers. For this reason, we do not use any symbols to
denote radian measure, but we use the word `radians' to denote these dimensionless units as needed.
For instance, we say one revolution measures `2 radians,' half of a revolution measures ` radians,'
and so forth.

As with degree measure, the distinction between the angle itself and its measure is often blurred

in  practice,    so  when    we     write  `  =   2 ',  we   mean      is  an   angle     which    measures         radians.13     We
                                                                                                                2

extend radian measure to oriented angles, just as we did with degrees beforehand, so that a positive

measure indicates counter-clockwise rotation and a negative measure indicates clockwise rotation.14

Much like before, two positive angles  and  are supplementary if  +  =  and complementary

if  +  = 2 . Finally, we leave it to the reader to show that when using radian measure, two angles
 and  are coterminal if and only if  =  + 2k for some integer k.

Example 10.1.3. Graph each of the (oriented) angles below in standard position and classify them
according to where their terminal side lies. Find three coterminal angles, at least one of which is
positive and one of which is negative.

Solution.

    1.  The angle  =          is positive, so we draw an angle with its initial side on the positive x-axis and
                           6
                                           (/6)
        rotate   counter-clockwise           2   =  1   of  a  revolution.      Thus      is  a  Quadrant   I   angle.  Coterminal
                                                    12

        angles  are of the form  =  + 2 · k, for some integer k. To make the arithmetic a bit

        easier, we note that 2 = 6 12 , thus when k = 1, we get  = 6 + 6 12 = 6 13 . Substituting
                                       12  = - 11 6                                                             24      6 25 .
        k  = -1   gives    =     6  -   6               and    when  we    let  k   = 2,  we  get    =   6  +    6  =

    2.  Since     = - 43    is  negative,     we  start  at    the  positive    x-axis    and    rotate  clockwise  (4/3)       =  2  of
                                                                                                                      2            3

        a revolution. We find  to be a Quadrant II angle. To find coterminal angles, we proceed as

        before   using   2    =  63 ,  and    compute        = - 43    +   6    ·k  for   integer  values   of  k.  We  obtain        23 ,
                                                                           3
        - 3 10       8
                and  3   as   coterminal      angles.

13The authors are well aware that we are now identifying radians with real numbers. We will justify this shortly.
14This, in turn, endows the subtended arcs with an orientation as well. We address this in short order.

3.  Since     =     9     is  positive,     we    rotate   counter-clockwise       from   the    positive     x-axis.     One full

    after  one   full  revolution        clockwise,    we      have  2  or  4  of   a  revolution         remaining.   Since the

It is worth mentioning that we could have plotted the angles in Example 10.1.3 by first converting
them to degree measure and following the procedure set forth in Example 10.1.2. While converting
back and forth from degrees and radians is certainly a good skill to have, it is best that you
learn to `think in radians' as well as you can `think in degrees'. The authors would, however, be

derelict in our duties if we ignored the basic conversion between these systems altogether. Since

one revolution counter-clockwise measures 360 and the same angle measures 2 radians, we can

use the proportion 360 2 radians , or its reduced equivalent, 180  radians , as the conversion factor between
                       For example, to convert 60 to radians we find 60              radians       
the two systems.                                                                       180      =  3  radians,  or

simply 3 . To convert from radian measure back to degrees, we multiply by the ratio  radian 180 . For
example, - 56 radians is equal to - 56 radians            180
                                                        radians     = -150.15 Of particular interest is the

fact  that  an  angle  which  measures  1  in  radian  measure  is  equal  to  180    57.2958.
                                                                                 

We summarize these conversions below.

Equation 10.1. Degree - Radian Conversion:

     To convert radian measure to degree measure, multiply by 180

                                                                                       radians

In light of Example 10.1.3 and Equation 10.1, the reader may well wonder what the allure of radian
measure is. The numbers involved are, admittedly, much more complicated than degree measure.
The answer lies in how easily angles in radian measure can be identified with real numbers. Consider
the Unit Circle, x2 +y2 = 1, as drawn below, the angle  in standard position and the corresponding
arc measuring s units in length. By definition, and the fact that the Unit Circle has radius 1, the

                               ss
radian measure of  is r = 1 = s so that, once again blurring the distinction between an angle
and its measure, we have  = s. In order to identify real numbers with oriented angles, we make
good use of this fact by essentially `wrapping' the real number line around the Unit Circle and
associating to each real number t an oriented arc on the Unit Circle with initial point (1, 0).

Viewing the vertical line x = 1 as another real number line demarcated like the y-axis, given a real
number t > 0, we `wrap' the (vertical) interval [0, t] around the Unit Circle in a counter-clockwise
fashion. The resulting arc has a length of t units and therefore the corresponding angle has radian
measure equal to t. If t < 0, we wrap the interval [t, 0] clockwise around the Unit Circle. Since
we have defined clockwise rotation as having negative radian measure, the angle determined by
this arc has radian measure equal to t. If t = 0, we are at the point (1, 0) on the x-axis which
corresponds to an angle with radian measure 0. In this way, we identify each real number t with
the corresponding angle with radian measure t.

  15Note that the negative sign indicates clockwise rotation in both systems, and so it is carried along accordingly.

          4

Solution.

1.  The    arc  associated  with      t=  3    is   the  arc  on  the    Unit  Circle   which  subtends      the  angle  3  in
                                          4                                                                              4

    radian   measure.    Since   4    is  8  of  a  revolution,      we  have  an  arc  which  begins    at  the  point  (1, 0)

    proceeds counter-clockwise up to midway through Quadrant II.

2. Since one revolution is 2 radians, and t = -2 is negative, we graph the arc which begins

    at (1, 0) and proceeds clockwise for one full revolution.

                                   y                                                              y

                                   1                                                              1

                                               1x                                                        1x

                                 t = 34                                                 t = -2

3. Like t = -2, t = -2 is negative, so we begin our arc at (1, 0) and proceed clockwise around

    the  unit   circle.  Since           3.14  and         1.57,     we  find  that  rotating  2  radians    clockwise   from
                                                    2

    the point (1, 0) lands us in Quadrant III. To more accurately place the endpoint, we proceed

    as  we  did  in  Example     10.1.1,     successively     halving    the   angle    measure   until  we  find  5     1.96
                                                                                                                   8

    which tells us our arc extends just a bit beyond the quarter mark into Quadrant III.

4. Since 117 is positive, the arc corresponding to t = 117 begins at (1, 0) and proceeds counter-

     clockwise. As 117 is much greater than 2, we wrap around the Unit Circle several times

     before  finally  reaching  our  endpoint.  We  approximate       117  as  18.62  which   tells  us  we  complete
                                                                      2
                                                                           5
     18  revolutions  counter-clockwise  with   0.62,  or  just  shy  of   8  of  a  revolution  to  spare.  In  other

     words, the terminal side of the angle which measures 117 radians in standard position is just

     short of being midway through Quadrant III.

                                y                                                     y

                      t = -2                                                         t = 117

10.1.1 Applications of Radian Measure: Circular Motion

Now that we have paired angles with real numbers via radian measure, a whole world of applications
awaits us. Our first excursion into this realm comes by way of circular motion. Suppose an object
is moving as pictured below along a circular path of radius r from the point P to the point Q in
an amount of time t.

                                                                       Q

                                                                        s
                                                                   
                                                                        rP

Here s represents a displacement so that s > 0 means the object is traveling in a counter-clockwise
direction and s < 0 indicates movement in a clockwise direction. Note that with this convention

                                                                                  s
the formula we used to define radian measure, namely  = r , still holds since a negative value
of s incurred from a clockwise displacement matches the negative we assign to  for a clockwise
rotation. In Physics, the average velocity of the object, denoted v and read as `v-bar', is defined
as the average rate of change of the position of the object with respect to time.16 As a result, we

  16See Definition 2.3 in Section 2.1 for a review of this concept.
10.1 Angles and their Measure                                                                                        707

have v = time displacement = st . The quantity v has units of time length and conveys two ideas: the direction
in which the object is moving and how fast the position of the object is changing. The contribution
of direction in the quantity v is either to make it positive (in the case of counter-clockwise motion)
or negative (in the case of clockwise motion), so that the quantity |v| quantifies how fast the object
is moving - it is the speed of the object. Measuring  in radians we have  = s thus s = r and

                                                                                                        r

                                              v = s = r = r · 
                                                       tt              t

The quantity  is called the average angular velocity of the object. It is denoted by  and is
                   t

read `omega-bar'. The quantity  is the average rate of change of the angle  with respect to time
and thus has units time radians . If  is constant throughout the duration of the motion, then it can be
shown17 that the average velocities involved, namely v and , are the same as their instantaneous

counterparts, v and , respectively. In this case, v is simply called the `velocity' of the object and
is the instantaneous rate of change of the position of the object with respect to time.18 Similarly,

 is called the `angular velocity' and is the instantaneous rate of change of the angle with respect

to time.

If the path of the object were `uncurled' from a circle to form a line segment, then the velocity of
the object on that line segment would be the same as the velocity on the circle. For this reason,
the quantity v is often called the linear velocity of the object in order to distinguish it from the
angular velocity, . Putting together the ideas of the previous paragraph, we get the following.

Equation 10.2. Velocity for Circular Motion: For an object moving on a circular path of
radius r with constant angular velocity , the (linear) velocity of the object is given by v = r.

We need to talk about units here. The units of v are time length , the units of r are length only, and
the units of  are time radians . Thus the left hand side of the equation v = r has units time length , whereas
                                                          time length·radians .
the  right  hand  side  has  units  length ·  radians  =                         The  supposed  contradiction  in    units  is
                                               time

resolved by remembering that radians are a dimensionless quantity and angles in radian measure

are identified with real numbers so that the units         length·radians        reduce to the units  time length .  We are
                                                                 time

long overdue for an example.

Example 10.1.5. Assuming that the surface of the Earth is a sphere, any point on the Earth can
be thought of as an object traveling on a circle which completes one revolution in (approximately)
24 hours. The path traced out by the point during this 24 hour period is the Latitude of that point.
Lakeland Community College is at 41.628 north latitude, and it can be shown19 that the radius of
the earth at this Latitude is approximately 2960 miles. Find the linear velocity, in miles per hour,
of Lakeland Community College as the world turns.

Solution. To use the formula v = r, we first need to compute the angular velocity . The earth

makes  one  revolution  in   24  hours,  and  one      revolution  is  2         radians,  so    =  2 radians  =     12 hours  ,
                                                                                                     24 hours

17You guessed it, using Calculus . . .
18See the discussion on Page 161 for more details on the idea of an `instantaneous' rate of change.
19We will discuss how we arrived at this approximation in Example 10.2.6.
708                                                           Foundations of Trigonometry

where, once again, we are using the fact that radians are real numbers and are dimensionless. (For
simplicity's sake, we are also assuming that we are viewing the rotation of the earth as counter-
clockwise so  > 0.) Hence, the linear velocity is

     v = 2960 miles ·   775 miles
                                                    12 hours  hour

It is worth noting that the quantity  1 revolution  in Example 10.1.5 is called the  ordinary frequency
                                        24 hours

of the motion and is usually denoted by the variable f . The ordinary frequency is a measure of

how often an object makes a complete cycle of the motion. The fact that  = 2f suggests that 

is also a frequency. Indeed, it is called the angular frequency of the motion. On a related note,
the quantity T = 1 is called the period of the motion and is the amount of time it takes for the

                        f
object to complete one cycle of the motion. In the scenario of Example 10.1.5, the period of the

motion is 24 hours, or one day.

The concepts of frequency and period help frame the equation v = r in a new light. That is, if 
is fixed, points which are farther from the center of rotation need to travel faster to maintain the
same angular frequency since they have farther to travel to make one revolution in one period's
time. The distance of the object to the center of rotation is the radius of the circle, r, and is
the `magnification factor' which relates  and v. We will have more to say about frequencies and
periods in Section 11.1. While we have exhaustively discussed velocities associated with circular
motion, we have yet to discuss a more natural question: if an object is moving on a circular path
of radius r with a fixed angular velocity (frequency) , what is the position of the object at time t?
The answer to this question is the very heart of Trigonometry and is answered in the next section.

     fast is the edge of the yo-yo spinning in miles per hour? Round your answer to two decimal
     places.

51. How many revolutions per minute would the yo-yo in exercise 50 have to complete if the edge
     of the yo-yo is to be spinning at a rate of 42 miles per hour? Round your answer to two
     decimal places.

52. In the yo-yo trick `Around the World,' the performer throws the yo-yo so it sweeps out a
     vertical circle whose radius is the yo-yo string. If the yo-yo string is 28 inches long and the
     yo-yo takes 3 seconds to complete one revolution of the circle, compute the speed of the yo-yo
     in miles per hour. Round your answer to two decimal places.

53. A computer hard drive contains a circular disk with diameter 2.5 inches and spins at a rate
     of 7200 RPM (revolutions per minute). Find the linear speed of a point on the edge of the
     disk in miles per hour.

54. A rock got stuck in the tread of my tire and when I was driving 70 miles per hour, the rock
     came loose and hit the inside of the wheel well of the car. How fast, in miles per hour, was
     the rock traveling when it came out of the tread? (The tire has a diameter of 23 inches.)

55. The Giant Wheel at Cedar Point is a circle with diameter 128 feet which sits on an 8 foot tall
     platform making its overall height is 136 feet. (Remember this from Exercise 17 in Section
     7.2?) It completes two revolutions in 2 minutes and 7 seconds.20 Assuming the riders are at
     the edge of the circle, how fast are they traveling in miles per hour?

56. Consider the circle of radius r pictured below with central angle , measured in radians, and

     subtended arc of length s. Prove that the area of the shaded sector is A = 12 r2.

     (Hint:  Use  the  proportion            A         =  circumference of the circle s .)

the given central angles and radii.

57.  =  , r = 12  58.  = 5 , r = 100  59.  = 330, r = 9.3
           6                  4       62.  = 1, r = 117

60.  = , r = 1    61.  = 240, r = 5

63. Imagine a rope tied around the Earth at the equator. Show that you need to add only 2 feet
     of length to the rope in order to lift it one foot above the ground around the entire equator.
     (You do NOT need to know the radius of the Earth to show this.)

64. With the help of your classmates, look for a proof that  is indeed a constant.

10.2 The Unit Circle: Cosine and Sine

In Section 10.1.1, we introduced circular motion and derived a formula which describes the linear

velocity of an object moving on a circular path at a constant angular velocity. One of the goals of

this section is describe the position of such an object. To that end, consider an angle  in standard

position and let P denote the point where the terminal side of  intersects the Unit Circle. By

associating the point P with the angle , we are assigning a position on the Unit Circle to the angle

. The x-coordinate of P is called the cosine of , written cos(), while the y-coordinate of P is

called the sine of , written sin().1 The reader is encouraged to verify that these rules used to

match an angle with its cosine and sine do, in fact, satisfy the definition of a function. That is, for

each angle , there is only one associated value of cos() and only one associated value of sin().

                     y                                                             y

Solution.

1. To find cos (270) and sin (270), we plot the angle  = 270 in standard position and find

the  point  on  the  terminal  side  of    which  lies  on  the  Unit  Circle.  Since  270  represents  3  of  a
                                                                                                        4

counter-clockwise revolution, the terminal side of  lies along the negative y-axis. Hence, the

point we seek is (0, -1) so that cos (270) = 0 and sin (270) = -1.

2. The angle  = - represents one half of a clockwise revolution so its terminal side lies on the
   negative x-axis. The point on the Unit Circle that lies on the negative x-axis is (-1, 0) which
   means cos(-) = -1 and sin(-) = 0.

    1The etymology of the name `sine' is quite colorful, and the interested reader is invited to research it; the `co' in
`cosine' is explained in Section 10.4.

3. When we sketch  = 45 in standard position, we see that its terminal does not lie along

any of the coordinate axes which makes our job of finding the cosine and sine values a bit

more difficult. Let P (x, y) denote the point on the terminal side of  which lies on the Unit

Circle. By definition, x = cos (45) and y = sin (45). If we drop a perpendicular line segment

from P to the x-axis, we obtain a 45 - 45 - 90 right triangle whose legs have lengths x

and y units. From Geometry,2 we get y = x. Since P (x, y) lies on the Unit Circle, we have
                                                                                                           
x2 + y2 = 1. Substituting y = x into this equation yields 2x2 = 1, or x = ± 12 = ± 22 .

Since P (x, y) lies in the first quadrant, x > 0, so x = cos (45) =            2   and  with  y  =  x  we  have
                     
y = sin (45) = 22 .

4.  As before, the terminal side of        =      does not lie on any of the coordinate axes, so we proceed
                                               6

    using a triangle approach. Letting P (x, y) denote the point on the terminal side of  which

    lies on the Unit Circle, we drop a perpendicular line segment from P to the x-axis to form

    a 30 - 60 - 90 right triangle.            After     a  bit           of  Geometry3      we  find  y  =     1  so  sin      = 12 .
                                                                                                               2            6

    Since  P (x, y)  lies  on  the   Unit  Circle,  we  substitute           y  =  2  into               =  1  to  get      =        or

non-quadrantal angles, the task was much more involved. In these latter cases, we made good
use of the fact that the point P (x, y) = (cos(), sin()) lies on the Unit Circle, x2 + y2 = 1. If
we substitute x = cos() and y = sin() into x2 + y2 = 1, we get (cos())2 + (sin())2 = 1. An
unfortunate4 convention, which the authors are compelled to perpetuate, is to write (cos())2 as
cos2() and (sin())2 as sin2(). Rewriting the identity using this convention results in the following
theorem, which is without a doubt one of the most important results in Trigonometry.

 Theorem 10.1. The Pythagorean Identity: For any angle , cos2() + sin2() = 1.

The moniker `Pythagorean' brings to mind the Pythagorean Theorem, from which both the Distance
Formula and the equation for a circle are ultimately derived.5 The word `Identity' reminds us that,
regardless of the angle , the equation in Theorem 10.1 is always true. If one of cos() or sin() is
known, Theorem 10.1 can be used to determine the other, up to a (±) sign. If, in addition, we know
where the terminal side of  lies when in standard position, then we can remove the ambiguity of
the (±) and completely determine the missing value as the next example illustrates.

Example 10.2.2. Using the given information about , find the indicated value.

1. If  is a Quadrant II angle with sin() = 35 , find cos().

                                            
                   3                        55 ,
2.    If    <<     2     with    cos() = -        find  sin().

3. If sin() = 1, find cos().

Solution.

1.    When    we   substitute     sin()  =  3    into   The  Pythagorean     Identity,   cos2() + sin2()   =      1,  we
                                            5
              cos2()         9          Solving, we find cos() = ± 45 .
      obtain             +   25   = 1.                                       Since       is a Quadrant II angle, its

      terminal side, when plotted in standard position, lies in Quadrant II. Since the x-coordinates

      are negative in Quadrant II, cos() is too. Hence, cos() = - 45 .

                                                                                                     
2. Substituting cos() = - 55 into cos2() + sin2() = 1 gives sin() = ± 25 = ± 2 5 5 . Since we

      are given that  <  < 32 , we know  is a Quadrant III angle. Hence both its sine and cosine

                                                                                 

      are negative and we conclude sin() = - 2 5 5 .

3. When we substitute sin() = 1 into cos2() + sin2() = 1, we find cos() = 0.

Another tool which helps immensely in determining cosines and sines of angles is the symmetry

inherent in the Unit Circle. Suppose, for instance, we wish to know the cosine and sine of  = 56 .

We plot  in standard position below and, as usual, let P (x, y) denote the point on the terminal

side  of    which  lies  on  the  Unit  Circle.  Note   that  the  terminal  side  of    lies     radians  short  of  one
                                                                                               6

half revolution. In Example 10.2.1, we determined that cos                   =      3  and  sin      = 12 . This means
                                                                   6               2              6

In  the  above              scenario,  the  angle     is  called  the  reference    angle                   for  the  angle  56 .         In  general,  for

a non-quadrantal angle , the reference angle for  (usually denoted ) is the acute angle made

between the terminal side of  and the x-axis. If  is a Quadrant I or IV angle,  is the angle

between the terminal side of  and the positive x-axis; if  is a Quadrant II or III angle,  is

the angle between the terminal side of  and the negative x-axis. If we let P denote the point

(cos(), sin()), then P lies on the Unit Circle. Since the Unit Circle possesses symmetry with

respect to the x-axis, y-axis and origin, regardless of where the terminal side of  lies, there is a

point Q symmetric with P which determines 's reference angle,  as seen below.

We have just outlined the proof of the following theorem.

 Theorem 10.2. Reference Angle Theorem. Suppose  is the reference angle for . Then
 cos() = ± cos() and sin() = ± sin(), where the choice of the (±) depends on the quadrant
 in which the terminal side of  lies.

In light of Theorem 10.2, it pays to know the cosine and sine values for certain common angles. In
the table below, we summarize the values which we consider essential and must be memorized.

1. We begin by plotting  = 225 in standard position and find its terminal side overshoots the

   negative x-axis to land in Quadrant III. Hence, we obtain 's reference angle  by subtracting:

The reader may have noticed that when expressed in radian measure, the reference angle for a

non-quadrantal angle is easy to spot. Reduced fraction multiples of  with a denominator of 6

have      as  a  reference  angle,   those  with  a  denominator  of  4  have     as  their  reference  angle,  and
       6                                                                       4

                                        Important Points on the Unit Circle

    6For once, we have something convenient about using radian measure in contrast to the abstract theoretical
nonsense about using them as a `natural' way to match oriented angles with real numbers!
10.2 The Unit Circle: Cosine and Sine                                                                725

The next example summarizes all of the important ideas discussed thus far in the section.
Example 10.2.4. Suppose  is an acute angle with cos() = 513 .

1. Find sin() and use this to plot  in standard position.

2. Find the sine and cosine of the following angles:

    (a)  =  +           (b)  = 2 -                        (c)  = 3 -           (d)  =     +
                                                                                       2

Solution.

1.  Proceeding  as  in  Example  10.2.2,  we  substitute  cos()  =  5   into  cos2() + sin2()  =  1  and
                                                                    13
    find sin() = ± 12 13 . Since  is an acute (and therefore Quadrant I) angle, sin() is positive.
    Hence, sin() = 13 12 . To plot  in standard position, we begin our rotation on the positive
    x-axis to the ray which contains the point (cos(), sin()) = 513 , 12 13 .

                                                         Sketching 

2. (a) To find the cosine and sine of  =  + , we first plot  in standard position. We can
          imagine the sum of the angles + as a sequence of two rotations: a rotation of  radians
          followed by a rotation of  radians.7 We see that  is the reference angle for , so by
          The Reference Angle Theorem, cos() = ± cos() = ± 513 and sin() = ± sin() = ± 12 13 .
          Since the terminal side of  falls in Quadrant III, both cos() and sin() are negative,
          hence, cos() = - 513 and sin() = - 12 13 .

7Since  +  =  + ,  may be plotted by reversing the order of rotations given here. You should do this.

(c) Taking a cue from the previous problem, we rewrite  = 3 -  as  = 3 + (-). The
     angle 3 represents one and a half revolutions counter-clockwise, so that when we `back
     up'  radians, we end up in Quadrant II. Using the Reference Angle Theorem, we get
     cos() = - 513 and sin() = 13 12 .

     angle here is not , so The Reference Angle Theorem is not immediately applicable.

     (It's important that you see why this is the case. Take a moment to think about this

     before reading on.) Let Q(x, y) be the point on the terminal side of  which lies on the

     Unit Circle so that x = cos() and y = sin(). Once we graph  in standard position,

     we use the fact that equal angles subtend equal chords to show that the dotted lines in
     the figure below are equal. Hence, x = cos() = - 12 13 . Similarly, we find y = sin() = 513 .

Our next example asks us to solve some very basic trigonometric equations.8

Example 10.2.5. Find all of the angles which satisfy the given equation.

1. cos() = 1                                2. sin() = - 1                           3. cos() = 0.
                2                                             2

Solution. Since there is no context in the problem to indicate whether to use degrees or radians,
we will default to using radian measure in our answers to each of these problems. This choice will
be justified later in the text when we study what is known as Analytic Trigonometry. In those
sections to come, radian measure will be the only appropriate angle measure so it is worth the time
to become "fluent in radians" now.

1. If cos() = 12 , then the terminal side of , when plotted in standard position, intersects the
   Unit Circle at x = 12 . This means  is a Quadrant I or IV angle with reference angle 3 .

                                                                                                     1
                               3                                                                     2

                                                                                                  3

     One solution in Quadrant I is  = 3 , and since all other Quadrant I solutions must be
                      3 ,                              for integers k.9
     coterminal with       we find       =  3   +  2k                      Proceeding similarly for the Quadrant

     IV  case,  we  find  the  solution     to    cos()  =  1    here  is  53 ,  so  our  answer  in    this  Quadrant  is
                                                            2
          5
       =  3  +  2k  for   integers   k.

2. If sin() = - 12 , then when  is plotted in standard position, its terminal side intersects the
   Unit Circle at y = - 12 . From this, we determine  is a Quadrant III or Quadrant IV angle
   with reference angle 6 .

    8We will study trigonometric equations more formally in Section 10.7. Enjoy these relatively straightforward
exercises while they last!

    9Recall in Section 10.1, two angles in radian measure are coterminal if and only if they differ by an integer multiple
of 2. Hence to describe all angles coterminal with a given angle, we add 2k for integers k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . .

In Quadrant III, one solution is 76 , so we capture all Quadrant III solutions by adding integer
                               7                                                             11
multiples     of  2:     =     6  + 2k.     In  Quadrant            IV,   one  solution  is   6    so  all  the  solutions       here

are  of  the  form       =  11    +   2k  for   integers     k.

3. The angles with cos() = 0 are quadrantal angles whose terminal sides, when plotted in

standard position, lie along the y-axis.

While,   technically     speaking,        isn't         a  reference     angle  we  can  nonetheless        use  it  to  find    our
                                      2
                                                                                                                         
answers.    If    we   follow  the   procedure          set  forth  in  the  previous    examples,     we   find     =   2       + 2k

and      =    3   + 2k      for   integers,    k.       While this solution is correct, it can be shortened to
              2
     
  =  2   + k      for  integers   k.  (Can   you        see  why    this  works  from    the  diagram?)

One of the key items to take from Example 10.2.5 is that, in general, solutions to trigonometric
equations consist of infinitely many answers. To get a feel for these answers, the reader is encouraged
to follow our mantra from Chapter 9 - that is, `When in doubt, write it out!' This is especially
important when checking answers to the exercises. For example, another Quadrant IV solution to
sin() = - 12 is  = - 6 . Hence, the family of Quadrant IV answers to number 2 above could just
have easily been written  = - 6 + 2k for integers k. While on the surface, this family may look

different  than  the  stated  solution  of    =  11  +  2k  for  integers  k,  we  leave  it  to  the  reader  to  show
                                                  6

they represent the same list of angles.

10.2.1 Beyond the Unit Circle

We began the section with a quest to describe the position of a particle experiencing circular motion.

In defining the cosine and sine functions, we assigned to each angle a position on the Unit Circle. In

this subsection, we broaden our scope to include circles of radius r centered at the origin. Consider

for the moment the acute angle  drawn below in standard position. Let Q(x, y) be the point on

the terminal side of  which lies on the circle x2 + y2 = r2, and let P (x , y ) be the point on the

terminal side of  which lies on the Unit Circle. Now consider dropping perpendiculars from P and

Q to create two right triangles, OP A and OQB. These triangles are similar,10 thus it follows

that  x  =  r  = r, so x = rx  and, similarly, we find y = ry .       Since, by definition, x          = cos() and
      x     1

y = sin(), we get the coordinates of Q to be x = r cos() and y = r sin(). By reflecting these

points through the x-axis, y-axis and origin, we obtain the result for all non-quadrantal angles ,

and we leave it to the reader to verify these formulas hold for the quadrantal angles.

                      y                                          y

                                  Q (x, y)

                                                                                          Q(x, y) = (r cos(), r sin())

                            P (x , y )

                                              rx                 1
                                                                              P (x , y )
                                     1

                                                                    

                                                            O         A(x , 0) B(x, 0)                         x

Not only can we describe the coordinates of Q in terms of cos() and sin() but since the radius of
the circle is r = x2 + y2, we can also express cos() and sin() in terms of the coordinates of Q.
These results are summarized in the following theorem.

Theorem 10.3. If Q(x, y) is the point on the terminal side of an angle , plotted in standard
position, which lies on the circle x2 + y2 = r2 then x = r cos() and y = r sin(). Moreover,

                      cos() = x =             x and sin() = y =                      y
                                  r           x2 + y2                 r            x2 + y2

10Do you remember why?
10.2 The Unit Circle: Cosine and Sine                                                                 731

Note that in the case of the Unit Circle we have r =                 x2 + y2 = 1, so Theorem 10.3 reduces to
our definitions of cos() and sin().

Example 10.2.6.

1. Suppose that the terminal side of an angle , when plotted in standard position, contains the
   point Q(4, -2). Find sin() and cos().

2. In Example 10.1.5 in Section 10.1, we approximated the radius of the earth at 41.628 north
   latitude to be 2960 miles. Justify this approximation if the radius of the Earth at the Equator
   is approximately 3960 miles.

Solution.

                                                                                    
1.  Using  Theorem  10.3          with  x  =  4  and  y  =  -2,  we  find  r=  (4)2 + (-2)2 = 20 = 2 5 so

                                                                             
    that cos() = xr = 24 5 = 2 5 5 and sin() = yr = - 225 = - 55 .

2. Assuming the Earth is a sphere, a cross-section through the poles produces a circle of radius
   3960 miles. Viewing the Equator as the x-axis, the value we seek is the x-coordinate of the
   point Q(x, y) indicated in the figure below.

                                  y                                            y

                                                                                          Q (x, y)
           -4 -2
                             -2                                                    41.628

                                                                                                  3960 x

                                                    Q(4, -2)

                    -4

    The terminal side of  contains Q(4, -2)                          A point on the Earth at 41.628N

    Using Theorem 10.3, we get x = 3960 cos (41.628). Using a calculator in `degree' mode, we
    find 3960 cos (41.628)  2960. Hence, the radius of the Earth at North Latitude 41.628 is

    approximately 2960 miles.

Theorem 10.3 gives us what we need to describe the position of an object traveling in a circular

path of radius r with constant angular velocity . Suppose that at time t, the object has swept

out an angle measuring  radians. If we assume that the object is at the point (r, 0) when t = 0,

the  angle    is  in  standard  position.  By  definition,     =     which  we  rewrite  as    = t.  According
                                                                  t

to Theorem 10.3, the location of the object Q(x, y) on the circle is found using the equations

x = r cos() = r cos(t) and y = r sin() = r sin(t). Hence, at time t, the object is at the point

(r cos(t), r sin(t)). We have just argued the following.

Equation 10.3. Suppose an object is traveling in a circular path of radius r centered at the
origin with constant angular velocity . If t = 0 corresponds to the point (r, 0), then the x and

                                      Equations for Circular Motion

Example 10.2.7. Suppose we are in the situation of Example 10.1.5. Find the equations of motion
of Lakeland Community College as the earth rotates.
Solution. From Example 10.1.5, we take r = 2960 miles and and  = 12 hours  . Hence, the equations
of motion are x = r cos(t) = 2960 cos 12 t and y = r sin(t) = 2960 sin 12 t , where x and y are
measured in miles and t is measured in hours.

In addition to circular motion, Theorem 10.3 is also the key to developing what is usually called
`right triangle' trigonometry.11 As we shall see in the sections to come, many applications in
trigonometry involve finding the measures of the angles in, and lengths of the sides of, right triangles.
Indeed, we made good use of some properties of right triangles to find the exact values of the cosine
and sine of many of the angles in Example 10.2.1, so the following development shouldn't be that
much of a surprise. Consider the generic right triangle below with corresponding acute angle .
The side with length a is called the side of the triangle adjacent to ; the side with length b is
called the side of the triangle opposite ; and the remaining side of length c (the side opposite the

right angle) is called the hypotenuse. We now imagine drawing this triangle in Quadrant I so that
the angle  is in standard position with the adjacent side to  lying along the positive x-axis.

                                                                                                                                          y

                                                                                                                    x
                         a

According to the Pythagorean Theorem, a2 + b2 = c2, so that the point P (a, b) lies on a circle of

radius  c.  Theorem  10.3  tells  us  that   cos()  =  a  and  sin()  =  bc ,  so  we  have  determined  the  cosine
                                                       c

and sine of  in terms of the lengths of the sides of the right triangle. Thus we have the following

theorem.

Theorem 10.4. Suppose  is an acute angle residing in a right triangle. If the length of the

side adjacent to  is a, the length of the side opposite  is b, and the length of the hypotenuse
is c, then cos() = a and sin() = b .
                     c                c

Example 10.2.8. Find the measure of the missing angle and the lengths of the missing sides of:

                                                    30
                                                        7

Solution. The first and easiest task is to find the measure of the missing angle. Since the sum of

angles of a triangle is 180, we know that the missing angle has measure 180 - 30 - 90 = 60.

We now proceed to find the lengths of the remaining two sides of the triangle. Let c denote the

length of the hypotenuse of the triangle. By Theorem 10.4, we have cos (30) = 7c , or c = cos(30) 7 .
                                                                                             
                     32 ,                                                                 14   3.
Since cos (30) =           we  have,  after  the  usual   fraction  gymnastics,    c   =    3      At this point, we

have two ways to proceed to find the length of the side opposite the 30 angle, which we'll denote
b. We know the length of the adjacent side is 7 and the length of the hypotenuse is 14 3 3 , so we

could use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side and solve (7)2 + b2 =                                14 3      for b.
                                                                                                                  3

Alternatively, we could use Theorem 10.4, namely that sin (30) = bc . Choosing the latter, we find

                                                                                    b = 7 3 3
                                                    c = 14 3 3

We close this section by noting that we can easily extend the functions cosine and sine to real

numbers by identifying a real number t with the angle  = t radians. Using this identification, we

define cos(t) = cos() and sin(t) = sin(). In practice this means expressions like cos() and sin(2)

can be found by regarding the inputs as angles in radian measure or real numbers; the choice is

the reader's. If we trace the identification of real numbers t with angles  in radian measure to its

roots on page 704, we can spell out this correspondence more precisely. For each real number t, we

associate an oriented arc t units in length with initial point (1, 0) and endpoint P (cos(t), sin(t)).

                             y                                                                y

                             1                                                                1

                                            t                                                         P (cos(t), sin(t))
                                 =t                                                               =t

                                               1x                                                       1x

In the same way we studied polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions, we will
study the trigonometric functions f (t) = cos(t) and g(t) = sin(t). The first order of business is to
find the domains and ranges of these functions. Whether we think of identifying the real number
t with the angle  = t radians, or think of wrapping an oriented arc around the Unit Circle to
find coordinates on the Unit Circle, it should be clear that both the cosine and sine functions are
defined for all real numbers t. In other words, the domain of f (t) = cos(t) and of g(t) = sin(t)
is (-, ). Since cos(t) and sin(t) represent x- and y-coordinates, respectively, of points on the
Unit Circle, they both take on all of the values between -1 an 1, inclusive. In other words, the
range of f (t) = cos(t) and of g(t) = sin(t) is the interval [-1, 1]. To summarize:
10.2 The Unit Circle: Cosine and Sine                                                                          735

   Theorem 10.5. Domain and Range of the Cosine and Sine Functions:

         · The function f (t) = cos(t)                     · The function g(t) = sin(t)
            - has domain (-, )                                - has domain (-, )
            - has range [-1, 1]                               - has range [-1, 1]

Suppose, as in the Exercises, we are asked to solve an equation such as sin(t) = - 12 . As we have
already mentioned, the distinction between t as a real number and as an angle  = t radians is often

blurred. Indeed, we solve sin(t) = - 12 in the exact same manner12 as we did in Example 10.2.5
number 2. Our solution is only cosmetically different in that the variable used is t rather than :

t  =  7  + 2k  or  t  =  11  + 2k  for  integers,  k.  We  will  study  the  cosine  and  sine  functions  in  greater
      6                   6

detail in Section 10.5. Until then, keep in mind that any properties of cosine and sine developed

in the following sections which regard them as functions of angles in radian measure apply equally

well if the inputs are regarded as real numbers.

  12Well, to be pedantic, we would be technically using `reference numbers' or `reference arcs' instead of `reference
angles' - but the idea is the same.

In Exercises 59 - 64, assume that  is an acute angle in a right triangle and use Theorem 10.4 to
find the requested side.

59. If  = 12 and the side adjacent to  has length 4, how long is the hypotenuse?
60. If  = 78.123 and the hypotenuse has length 5280, how long is the side adjacent to ?
61. If  = 59 and the side opposite  has length 117.42, how long is the hypotenuse?
62. If  = 5 and the hypotenuse has length 10, how long is the side opposite ?
63. If  = 5 and the hypotenuse has length 10, how long is the side adjacent to ?
64. If  = 37.5 and the side opposite  has length 306, how long is the side adjacent to ?

In Exercises 65 - 68, let  be the angle in standard position whose terminal side contains the given
point then compute cos() and sin().

In Exercises 69 - 72, find the equations of motion for the given scenario. Assume that the center of
the motion is the origin, the motion is counter-clockwise and that t = 0 corresponds to a position
along the positive x-axis. (See Equation 10.3 and Example 10.1.5.)

69. A point on the edge of the spinning yo-yo in Exercise 50 from Section 10.1.
     Recall: The diameter of the yo-yo is 2.25 inches and it spins at 4500 revolutions per minute.

70. The yo-yo in exercise 52 from Section 10.1.
     Recall: The radius of the circle is 28 inches and it completes one revolution in 3 seconds.

71. A point on the edge of the hard drive in Exercise 53 from Section 10.1.
     Recall: The diameter of the hard disk is 2.5 inches and it spins at 7200 revolutions per minute.

72. A passenger on the Big Wheel in Exercise 55 from Section 10.1.

     Recall: The diameter is 128 feet and completes 2 revolutions in 2 minutes, 7 seconds.

73. Consider the numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Take the square root of each of these numbers, then
     divide each by 2. The resulting numbers should look hauntingly familiar. (See the values in
     the table on 722.)

74. Let  and  be the two acute angles of a right triangle. (Thus  and  are complementary
     angles.) Show that sin() = cos() and sin() = cos(). The fact that co-functions of
     complementary angles are equal in this case is not an accident and a more general result will
     be given in Section 10.4.

75. In the scenario of Equation 10.3, we assumed that at t = 0, the object was at the point (r, 0).
     If this is not the case, we can adjust the equations of motion by introducing a `time delay.' If
     t0 > 0 is the first time the object passes through the point (r, 0), show, with the help of your
     classmates, the equations of motion are x = r cos((t - t0)) and y = r sin((t - t0)).

10.3 The Six Circular Functions and Fundamental Identities

In section 10.2, we defined cos() and sin() for angles  using the coordinate values of points on
the Unit Circle. As such, these functions earn the moniker circular functions.1 It turns out that
cosine and sine are just two of the six commonly used circular functions which we define below.

 Definition 10.2. The Circular Functions: Suppose  is an angle plotted in standard position
 and P (x, y) is the point on the terminal side of  which lies on the Unit Circle.

       The cosine of , denoted cos(), is defined by cos() = x.

       The sine of , denoted sin(), is defined by sin() = y.

       The secant of , denoted sec(), is defined by sec() = 1 , provided x = 0.
                                                                                   x

       The cosecant of , denoted csc(), is defined by csc() = 1 , provided y = 0.
                                                                                      y

       The tangent of , denoted tan(), is defined by tan() = y , provided x = 0.
                                                                                      x

       The cotangent of , denoted cot(), is defined by cot() = x , provided y = 0.
                                                                                         y

While we left the history of the name `sine' as an interesting research project in Section 10.2, the
names `tangent' and `secant' can be explained using the diagram below. Consider the acute angle 
below in standard position. Let P (x, y) denote, as usual, the point on the terminal side of  which
lies on the Unit Circle and let Q(1, y ) denote the point on the terminal side of  which lies on the
vertical line x = 1.

                                                              y

                                Q(1, y ) = (1, tan())

        1
                      P (x, y)

        

     O    A(x, 0) B(1, 0)                              x

    1In Theorem 10.4 we also showed cosine and sine to be functions of an angle residing in a right triangle so we
could just as easily call them trigonometric functions. In later sections, you will find that we do indeed use the phrase
`trigonometric function' interchangeably with the term `circular function'.
10.3 The Six Circular Functions and Fundamental Identities                                                             745

The word `tangent' comes from the Latin meaning `to touch,' and for this reason, the line x = 1

is called a tangent line to the Unit Circle since it intersects, or `touches', the circle at only one

point, namely (1, 0). Dropping perpendiculars from P and Q creates a pair of similar triangles

OP A and OQB.                Thus   y  =  1  which gives y  =    y  = tan(), where this last equality comes from
                                    y     x                      x

applying Definition 10.2. We have just shown that for acute angles , tan() is the y-coordinate of

the point on the terminal side of  which lies on the line x = 1 which is tangent to the Unit Circle.

Now the word `secant' means `to cut', so a secant line is any line that `cuts through' a circle at two

points.2 The line containing the terminal side of  is a secant line since it intersects the Unit Circle

in Quadrants I and III. With the point P lying on the Unit Circle, the length of the hypotenuse

of OP A is 1. If we let h denote the length of the hypotenuse of OQB, we have from similar

triangles  that  h  =  1x ,  or  h  =  1  =  sec().  Hence  for  an  acute  angle  ,  sec()  is  the  length  of  the  line
                 1                     x

segment which lies on the secant line determined by the terminal side of  and `cuts off' the tangent

line x = 1. Not only do these observations help explain the names of these functions, they serve as

the basis for a fundamental inequality needed for Calculus which we'll explore in the Exercises.

Of the six circular functions, only cosine and sine are defined for all angles. Since cos() = x and
sin() = y in Definition 10.2, it is customary to rephrase the remaining four circular functions in
terms of cosine and sine. The following theorem is a result of simply replacing x with cos() and y
with sin() in Definition 10.2.

Theorem 10.6. Reciprocal and Quotient Identities:

 sec() = 1 , provided cos() = 0; if cos() = 0, sec() is undefined.
               cos()

 csc() = 1 , provided sin() = 0; if sin() = 0, csc() is undefined.
               sin()

 tan() = sin() , provided cos() = 0; if cos() = 0, tan() is undefined.
               cos()

 cot() = cos() , provided sin() = 0; if sin() = 0, cot() is undefined.
               sin()

It is high time for an example.

Example 10.3.1. Find the indicated value, if it exists.

1. sec (60)                                  2. csc 74                                3. cot(3)

4. tan (), where  is any angle coterminal with 32 .
                                     

5. cos (), where csc() = - 5 and  is a Quadrant IV angle.

6. sin (), where tan() = 3 and  <  < 32 .

2Compare this with the definition given in Section 2.1.

Solution.

1.   According     to  Theorem  10.6,    sec (60) =    cos(60) 1 .  Hence,  sec (60) =    1    = 2.
                                                                                        (1/2)

                                                                          2
                  7    = - 22 , csc      7          17 = 1          = -  = - 2.
2. Since sin      4                      4  =   sin( 4 ) - 2/2              2

3. Since  = 3 radians is not one of the `common angles' from Section 10.2, we resort to the

   calculator for a decimal approximation. Ensuring that the calculator is in radian mode, we
   find cot(3) = sin(3) cos(3)  -7.015.

4.   If  is coterminal with     3  ,  then  cos()   =  cos  3       = 0 and sin() = sin  3     = -1. Attempting
                                2                           2                            2

     to compute tan() = cos() sin() results in 0-1 , so tan() is undefined.

                                                                                
                                            1         5 so sin() = - 15 = - 55 . As we saw in Section 10.2,
5.   We are given that csc() =           sin()  =-

     we can use the Pythagorean Identity, cos2() + sin2() = 1, to find cos() by knowing sin().
                                                2                                                    
     Substituting, we get cos2() + - 55 = 1, which gives cos2() = 45 , or cos() = ± 2 5 5 . Since
                                                                    
      is a Quadrant IV angle, cos() > 0, so cos() = 5 2 5 .

6. If tan() = 3, then cos() sin() = 3. Be careful - this does NOT mean we can take sin() = 3 and

     cos() = 1. Instead, from cos() sin() = 3 we get: sin() = 3 cos(). To relate cos() and sin(), we

     once again employ the Pythagorean Identity, cos2() + sin2() = 1. Solving sin() = 3 cos()

     for  cos(),  we   find  cos()    =  1  sin().  Substituting    this  into  the  Pythagorean  Identity,  we  find
                                         3                                               
                             2
     sin2() +     1                                         2         9                  3 10                    3
                   3 sin() = 1. Solving, we get sin () = 10 so sin() = ± 10 . Since  <  < 2 ,
                                                                                                     
      is a Quadrant III angle. This means sin() < 0, so our final answer is sin() = - 3 10 10 .

While the Reciprocal and Quotient Identities presented in Theorem 10.6 allow us to always reduce
problems involving secant, cosecant, tangent and cotangent to problems involving cosine and sine,
it is not always convenient to do so.3 It is worth taking the time to memorize the tangent and
cotangent values of the common angles summarized below.

    3As we shall see shortly, when solving equations involving secant and cosecant, we usually convert back to cosines
and sines. However, when solving for tangent or cotangent, we usually stick with what we're dealt.

                                                                  undefined
                                                        2

Coupling Theorem 10.6 with the Reference Angle Theorem, Theorem 10.2, we get the following.

 Theorem 10.7. Generalized Reference Angle Theorem. The values of the circular
 functions of an angle, if they exist, are the same, up to a sign, of the corresponding circu-
 lar functions of its reference angle. More specifically, if  is the reference angle for , then:
 cos() = ± cos(), sin() = ± sin(), sec() = ± sec(), csc() = ± csc(), tan() = ± tan()
 and cot() = ± cot(). The choice of the (±) depends on the quadrant in which the terminal
 side of  lies.

We put Theorem 10.7 to good use in the following example.

Example 10.3.2. Find all angles which satisfy the given equation.

1. sec() = 2                                                                                     3. cot() = -1.
                                              2. tan() = 3

Solution.

1.  To   solve  sec() = 2,        we  convert   to  cosines   and       get     1     =2     or  cos() =   12 .  This  is  the    exact
                                                                             cos()
                                                                                                                               
    same   equation     we  solved    in  Example       10.2.5,   number       1,  so  we  know   the  answer    is:     =     3  + 2k

    or     =  5  +   2k     for  integers   k.
              3

2. From the table of common values, we see tan 3 = 3. According to Theorem 10.7, we know
                                      

   the solutions to tan() = 3 must, therefore, have a reference angle of 3 . Our next task is

    to determine in which quadrants the solutions to this equation lie. Since tangent is defined

    as  the   ratio  y  of  points    (x, y)  on  the   Unit  Circle    with       x  =  0,  tangent   is  positive    when       x  and
                     x

    y have the same sign (i.e., when they are both positive or both negative.) This happens in

    Quadrants    I   and    III.  In  Quadrant      I,  we   get  the   solutions:       =       + 2k  for  integers       k,  and   for
                                                                                             3
                                         4
    Quadrant     III,   we  get       =  3  + 2k        for  integers   k.     While     these   descriptions    of  the   solutions

    are  correct,    they   can   be  combined      into     one  list  as     =      + k    for  integers  k.   The   latter     form
                                                                                   3

    of the solution is best understood looking at the geometry of the situation in the diagram

    below.4

3.   From  the     table  of  common       values,               we       see  that     has   a  cotangent    of   1,     which     means  the
                                                                                     4
     solutions to cot() = -1 have a reference angle of 4 . To find the quadrants in which our
                                                                 x
     solutions lie,  we note that cot() =                        y    for a point (x, y) on the Unit Circle where y                    = 0.  If

     cot() is negative, then x and y must have different signs (i.e., one positive and one negative.)

     Hence,    our  solutions    lie  in  Quadrants                   II  and  IV.   Our  Quadrant     II  solution       is    =   3  +  2k,
                                                                                                                                    4
                                                7
     and  for  Quadrant   IV,    we   get    =  4                + 2k     for  integers   k.  Can   these  lists  be      combined?    Indeed

     they  can  -   one  such    way  to  capture                all  the  solutions    is:     =   3  + k    for  integers     k.
                                                                                                    4

                                                              x                                                                     x

We have already seen the importance of identities in trigonometry. Our next task is to use use the

Reciprocal and Quotient Identities found in Theorem 10.6 coupled with the Pythagorean Identity

found in Theorem 10.1 to derive new Pythagorean-like identities for the remaining four circular
functions. Assuming cos() = 0, we may start with cos2() + sin2() = 1 and divide both sides
by cos2() to obtain 1 + cos2() sin2() = cos2() 1 . Using properties of exponents along with the Reciprocal
and Quotient Identities, this reduces to 1 + tan2() = sec2(). If sin() = 0, we can divide both
sides of the identity cos2() + sin2() = 1 by sin2(), apply Theorem 10.6 once again, and obtain
cot2() + 1 = csc2(). These three Pythagorean Identities are worth memorizing and they, along

with some of their other common forms, are summarized in the following theorem.

Theorem 10.8. The Pythagorean Identities:

1. cos2() + sin2() = 1.
   Common Alternate Forms:

         1 - sin2() = cos2()
         1 - cos2() = sin2()

2. 1 + tan2() = sec2(), provided cos() = 0.
   Common Alternate Forms:

         sec2() - tan2() = 1
         sec2() - 1 = tan2()

3. 1 + cot2() = csc2(), provided sin() = 0.
   Common Alternate Forms:

             csc2() - cot2() = 1
             csc2() - 1 = cot2()

Trigonometric identities play an important role in not just Trigonometry, but in Calculus as well.
We'll use them in this book to find the values of the circular functions of an angle and solve equations
and inequalities. In Calculus, they are needed to simplify otherwise complicated expressions. In
the next example, we make good use of the Theorems 10.6 and 10.8.

Example 10.3.3. Verify the following identities. Assume that all quantities are defined.

1. 1 = sin()                                                 2. tan() = sin() sec()
    csc()
                                                             4. sec() = 1
3. (sec() - tan())(sec() + tan()) = 1                            1 - tan() cos() - sin()
5. 6 sec() tan() = 3 - 3
                                                             6. sin() = 1 + cos()
                          1 - sin() 1 + sin()                    1 - cos() sin()

Solution. In verifying identities, we typically start with the more complicated side of the equation
and use known identities to transform it into the other side of the equation.

1.  To  verify     1   = sin(),  we  start  with  the  left  side.  Using  csc() =  sin() 1 ,  we  get:
                csc()

                                               1 = 11 = sin(),
                                            csc() sin()

    which is what we were trying to prove.

2.   Starting    with  the  right  hand  side  of  tan() = sin() sec(),  we                      use  sec() =     1      and   find:
                                                                                                               cos()

                                   sin() sec() = sin() 1 = sin() = tan(),
                                                              cos() cos()

   where the last equality is courtesy of Theorem 10.6.

3. Expanding the left hand side of the equation gives: (sec() - tan())(sec() + tan()) =
   sec2() - tan2(). According to Theorem 10.8, sec2() - tan2() = 1. Putting it all together,

                          (sec() - tan())(sec() + tan()) = sec2() - tan2() = 1.

4. While both sides of our last identity contain fractions, the left side affords us more opportu-

     nities  to  use  our  identities.5  Substituting  sec() =     1   and  tan() =                   cos() sin() ,  we  get:
                                                                cos()

                                         1             1

                 sec() = cos() = cos() · cos()
                 1 - tan()         1 - sin() 1 - sin() cos()

                                         cos()         cos()

                                         1 (cos())                                                    1        (cos())
                            = cos() =                                                                 sin()
                                                                                                      cos()
                                   1 - sin() (cos()) (1)(cos()) -
                                         cos()

                            = 1,
                                 cos() - sin()

     which is exactly what we had set out to show.

5. The right hand side of the equation seems to hold more promise. We get common denomina-
   tors and add:

                 3-3 =                                 3(1 + sin()) - 3(1 - sin())
             1 - sin() 1 + sin()                   (1 - sin())(1 + sin()) (1 + sin())(1 - sin())

                                            = 1 - sin2 3 + 3 sin() () - 1 - sin2 3 - 3 sin() ()

                                            = 1 - sin2 (3 + 3 sin()) - (3 - 3 sin()) ()

                                              = 1 - sin2 6 sin()()

5Or, to put to another way, earn more partial credit if this were an exam question!
10.3 The Six Circular Functions and Fundamental Identities            751

At this point, it is worth pausing to remind ourselves of our goal. We wish to trans-
form this expression into 6 sec() tan(). Using a reciprocal and quotient identity, we find
6 sec() tan() = 6 cos() cos() 1 sin() . In other words, we need to get cosines in our denomina-
tor. Theorem 10.8 tells us 1 - sin2() = cos2() so we get:

3 1 - sin() - 3 1 + sin() = 1 - sin2 6 sin()() = cos2 6 sin() ()

           =6 1            sin() = 6 sec() tan()
                    cos()  cos()

6. It is debatable which side of the identity is more complicated. One thing which stands out
   is that the denominator on the left hand side is 1 - cos(), while the numerator of the right
   hand side is 1 + cos(). This suggests the strategy of starting with the left hand side and
   multiplying the numerator and denominator by the quantity 1 + cos():

sin() = sin() · (1 + cos()) = sin()(1 + cos())
1 - cos()  (1 - cos()) (1 + cos()) (1 - cos())(1 + cos())

           = 1 - cos2 sin()(1 + cos()) () = sin2 sin()(1 + cos()) ()
                $sin$($)(1 + cos()) 1 + cos()

           = $sin$($) sin() = sin()

In Example 10.3.3 number 6 above, we see that multiplying 1 - cos() by 1 + cos() produces a
difference of squares that can be simplified to one term using Theorem 10.8. Thisis exactly the
same kind of phenomenon that occurs when we multiply expressions such as 1 - 2 by 1 + 2
or 3 - 4i by 3 + 4i. (Can you recall instances from Algebra where we did such things?) For this
reason, the quantities (1 - cos()) and (1 + cos()) are called `Pythagorean Conjugates.' Below is
a list of other common Pythagorean Conjugates.

                                              Pythagorean Conjugates
       1 - cos() and 1 + cos(): (1 - cos())(1 + cos()) = 1 - cos2() = sin2()

       1 - sin() and 1 + sin(): (1 - sin())(1 + sin()) = 1 - sin2() = cos2()

       sec() - 1 and sec() + 1: (sec() - 1)(sec() + 1) = sec2() - 1 = tan2()

       sec()-tan() and sec()+tan(): (sec()-tan())(sec()+tan()) = sec2()-tan2() = 1

       csc() - 1 and csc() + 1: (csc() - 1)(csc() + 1) = csc2() - 1 = cot2()

       csc() - cot() and csc() + cot(): (csc() - cot())(csc() + cot()) = csc2() - cot2() = 1

Verifying trigonometric identities requires a healthy mix of tenacity and inspiration. You will need
to spend many hours struggling with them just to become proficient in the basics. Like many
things in life, there is no short-cut here - there is no complete algorithm for verifying identities.
Nevertheless, a summary of some strategies which may be helpful (depending on the situation) is
provided below and ample practice is provided for you in the Exercises.

                                       Strategies for Verifying Identities
       Try working on the more complicated side of the identity.

       Use the Reciprocal and Quotient Identities in Theorem 10.6 to write functions on one side
         of the identity in terms of the functions on the other side of the identity. Simplify the
         resulting complex fractions.

       Add rational expressions with unlike denominators by obtaining common denominators.

       Use the Pythagorean Identities in Theorem 10.8 to `exchange' sines and cosines, secants
         and tangents, cosecants and cotangents, and simplify sums or differences of squares to one
         term.

       Multiply numerator and denominator by Pythagorean Conjugates in order to take advan-
         tage of the Pythagorean Identities in Theorem 10.8.

       If you find yourself stuck working with one side of the identity, try starting with the other
         side of the identity and see if you can find a way to bridge the two parts of your work.

10.3.1 Beyond the Unit Circle

In Section 10.2, we generalized the cosine and sine functions from coordinates on the Unit Circle
to coordinates on circles of radius r. Using Theorem 10.3 in conjunction with Theorem 10.8, we
generalize the remaining circular functions in kind.

Theorem 10.9. Suppose Q(x, y) is the point on the terminal side of an angle  (plotted in
standard position) which lies on the circle of radius r, x2 + y2 = r2. Then:

      sec() = r =      x2 + y2 , provided x = 0.
                    x    x

      csc() = r =      x2 + y2 , provided y = 0.
                    y    y

      tan() = y , provided x = 0.
                    x

      cot() = x , provided y = 0.

Example 10.3.4.

1. Suppose the terminal side of , when plotted in standard position, contains the point Q(3, -4).
   Find the values of the six circular functions of .

2. Suppose  is a Quadrant IV angle with cot() = -4. Find the values of the five remaining
   circular functions of .

Solution.

                                                                                       
   1. Since x = 3 and y = -4, r = x2 + y2 = (3)2 + (-4)2 = 25 = 5. Theorem 10.9 tells us

       cos() = 35 , sin() = - 45 , sec() = 53 , csc() = - 54 , tan() = - 43 and cot() = - 34 .

2. In order to use Theorem 10.9, we need to find a point Q(x, y) which lies on the terminal side

of , when  is plotted in standard position. We have that cot() = -4 = xy , and since  is a

Quadrant IV angle, we also know x > 0 and y < 0. Viewing -4 = 4-1 , we may choose6 x = 4
                                                                                    
and y = -1 so that r =                      x2 + y2 =       (4)2 + (-1)2 = 17. ApplyingTheorem 10.9 once

                                                   
more, we find cos() = 417 = 4 1717 , sin() = - 117 = - 1177 , sec() = 417 , csc() = -17

and tan() = - 14 .

We may also specialize Theorem 10.9 to the case of acute angles  which reside in a right triangle,
as visualized below.

                                                            c
                                                                                   b

                                                          

                                                            a

Theorem 10.10. Suppose  is an acute angle residing in a right triangle. If the length of the

side adjacent to  is a, the length of the side opposite  is b, and the length of the hypotenuse

is c, then          tan() = b               sec() = c                csc() = c          cot() = a
                                a                       a                        b                  b

The following example uses Theorem 10.10 as well as the concept of an `angle of inclination.' The
angle of inclination (or angle of elevation) of an object refers to the angle whose initial side is some
kind of base-line (say, the ground), and whose terminal side is the line-of-sight to an object above
the base-line. This is represented schematically below.

6We  may    choose  any  values  x  and  y  so  long  as  x > 0,  y  <0  and  x  = -4.  For  example,  we  could  choose  x=8
                                                                              y

side of  is the portion of the line with slope - 41 which extends from the origin into Quadrant IV.

Example 10.3.5.

   1. The angle of inclination from a point on the ground 30 feet away to the top of Lakeland's
       Armington Clocktower7 is 60. Find the height of the Clocktower to the nearest foot.

   2. In order to determine the height of a California Redwood tree, two sightings from the ground,
       one 200 feet directly behind the other, are made. If the angles of inclination were 45 and
       30, respectively, how tall is the tree to the nearest foot?

Solution.

   1. We can represent the problem situation using a right triangle as shown below. If we let h
       denote the height of the tower, then Theorem 10.10 gives tan (60) = h30 . From this we get
                         
       h = 30 tan (60 ) = 30 3  51.96. Hence, the Clocktower is approximately 52 feet tall.

                                                                         h ft.

                                                          60
                                                           30 ft.

2. Sketching the problem situation below, we find ourselves with two unknowns: the height h of

    the tree and the distance x from the base of the tree to the first observation point.

7Named in honor of Raymond Q. Armington, Lakeland's Clocktower has been a part of campus since 1972.

                                    Finding the height of a California Redwood

Using        Theorem   10.10,       we   get  a  pair  of  equations:    tan (45)      =  h  and  tan (30)   =   x+200 h .  Since
                                                                                          x

tan (45) = 1, the first equation gives                     h  = 1, or x = h.           Substituting this into the second
                                                           x                                                     

equation     gives        h     =   tan (30)      =    33 . Clearing fractions, we get 3h = (h + 200)                 3. The
                       h+200

result is a linear equation for h, so we proceed to expand the right hand side and gather all

the terms involving h to one side.

                                                                                  
                                                       3h = (h + 200) 3
                                                                                  
                                                       3h = h 3 + 200 3
                                                                         
                                              3h - h 3 = 200 3
                                                                         
                                              (3 - 3)h = 200 3
                                                                         
                                                                  200 3
                                                           h=              273.20

Hence, the tree is approximately 273 feet tall.

As we did in Section 10.2.1, we may consider all six circular functions as functions of real numbers.

At this stage, there are three equivalent ways to define the functions sec(t), csc(t), tan(t) and

cot(t) for real numbers t. First, we could go through the formality of the wrapping function on

page 704 and define these functions as the appropriate ratios of x and y coordinates of points on

the Unit Circle; second, we could define them by associating the real number t with the angle

 = t radians so that the value of the trigonometric function of t coincides with that of ; lastly,

we could simply define them using the Reciprocal and Quotient Identities as combinations of the

functions f (t) = cos(t) and g(t) = sin(t). Presently, we adopt the last approach. We now set about

determining the domains and ranges of the remaining four circular functions. Consider the function

F (t) = sec(t) defined as F (t) = sec(t) = cos(t) 1 . We know F is undefined whenever cos(t) = 0. From
                                                                                    
Example 10.2.5 number 3, we know cos(t) = 0 whenever t =                            2  +  k   for  integers  k.  Hence, our

domain  for  F (t)  =  sec(t),  in  set  builder  notation    is  {t  :  t  =     + k, for   integers  k}.   To  get  a     better
                                                                               2

understanding what set of real numbers we're dealing with, it pays to write out and graph this

set. Running through a few values of k, we find the domain to be {t : t = ± 2 , ± 32 , ± 52 , . . .}.
Graphing this set on the number line we get
756                                                                                    Foundations of Trigonometry

                                       - 25 - 23 - 2 0 2                        3           5

                                                                                 2          2

Using interval notation to describe this set, we get

             . . .  - 5 , - 3  - 3 , -   -  ,    , 3  3 , 5  . . .
                           22                   22                      22           22                 22

This is cumbersome, to say the least! In order to write this in a more compact way, we note that

from the set-builder description of the domain, the kth point excluded from the domain, which we'll

call  xk,  can  be  found  by  the     formula  xk  =      +    k  .  (We  are  using      sequence   notation     from     Chapter    9.)
                                                       2
Getting a common denominator and factoring out the  in the numerator, we get xk = 2 (2k+1) . The

domain consists of the intervals determined by successive points xk: (xk, xk + 1) = 2 (2k+1) , 2 (2k+3) .

In order to capture all of the intervals in the domain, k must run through all of the integers, that

is, k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . . The way we denote taking the union of infinitely many intervals like this is

to use what we call in this text extended interval notation. The domain of F (t) = sec(t) can

now be written as

                                                        (2k + 1) , (2k + 3)
                                              k=-             2                 2

The reader should compare this notation with summation notation introduced in Section 9.2, in
particular the notation used to describe geometric series in Theorem 9.2. In the same way the
index k in the series 

                                                               ark-1

                                                                                k=1

can never equal the upper limit , but rather, ranges through all of the natural numbers, the index

k in the union                                   
                                              k=-
                                                        (2k + 1) , (2k + 3)
                                                              2                 2

can never actually be  or -, but rather, this conveys the idea that k ranges through all of the

integers. Now that we have painstakingly determined the domain of F (t) = sec(t), it is time to

discuss the range. Once again, we appeal to the definition F (t) = sec(t) = cos(t) 1 . The range of

f (t) = cos(t) is [-1, 1], and since F (t) = sec(t) is undefined when cos(t) = 0, we split our discussion

into two cases: when 0 < cos(t)  1 and when -1  cos(t) < 0. If 0 < cos(t)  1, then we can

divide  the  inequality    cos(t)      1  by  cos(t)   to  obtain     sec(t)  =        1       1.   Moreover,      using    the   notation
                                                                                    cos(t)

introduced      in  Section  4.2,  we  have   that  as  cos(t)          0+,  sec(t)  =         1      very   1     (+)      very  big  (+).
                                                                                            cos(t)
                                                                                                            small

In other words, as cos(t)  0+, sec(t)  . If, on the other hand, if -1  cos(t) < 0, then dividing

by  cos(t)  causes  a  reversal    of  the  inequality    so  that    sec(t)  =       1        -1.  In  this  case,     as  cos(t)     0-,
                                                                                   sec(t)

sec(t) =       1               1        very big (-), so that as cos(t)  0-, we get sec(t)  -.                                      Since
            cos(t)
                       very small (-)

f (t) = cos(t) admits all of the values in [-1, 1], the function F (t) = sec(t) admits all of the values
in (-, -1]  [1, ). Using set-builder notation, the range of F (t) = sec(t) can be written as
{u : u  -1 or u  1}, or, more succinctly,8 as {u : |u|  1}.9 Similar arguments can be used
to determine the domains and ranges of the remaining three circular functions: csc(t), tan(t) and
cot(t). The reader is encouraged to do so. (See the Exercises.) For now, we gather these facts into
the theorem below.

    8Using Theorem 2.4 from Section 2.4.
    9Notice we have used the variable `u' as the `dummy variable' to describe the range elements. While there is no
mathematical reason to do this (we are describing a set of real numbers, and, as such, could use t again) we choose
u to help solidify the idea that these real numbers are the outputs from the inputs, which we have been calling t.

We close this section with a few notes about solving equations which involve the circular functions.

First, the discussion on page 735 in Section 10.2.1 concerning solving equations applies to all six

circular functions, not just f (t) = cos(t) and g(t) = sin(t). In particular, to solve the equation

cot(t) = -1 for real numbers t, we can use the same thought process we used in Example 10.3.2,

number 3 to solve cot() = -1 for angles  in radian measure - we just need to remember to write

our answers using the variable t as opposed to . Next, it is critical that you know the domains

and ranges of the six circular functions so that you know which equations have no solutions. For

example,  sec(t)  =  1  has  no  solution  because  1  is  not  in  the  range  of  secant.  Finally,  you  will  need  to
                     2                              2

review the notions of reference angles and coterminal angles so that you can see why csc(t) = -42

has an infinite set of solutions in Quadrant III and another infinite set of solutions in Quadrant IV.

10.3 The Six Circular Functions and Fundamental Identities  761

In Exercises 70 - 75, use Theorem 10.10 to answer the question. Assume that  is an angle in a
right triangle.

  70. If  = 30 and the side opposite  has length 4, how long is the side adjacent to ?
  71. If  = 15 and the hypotenuse has length 10, how long is the side opposite ?
  72. If  = 87 and the side adjacent to  has length 2, how long is the side opposite ?
  73. If  = 38.2 and the side opposite  has lengh 14, how long is the hypoteneuse?
  74. If  = 2.05 and the hypotenuse has length 3.98, how long is the side adjacent to ?
  75. If  = 42 and the side adjacent to  has length 31, how long is the side opposite ?

76. A tree standing vertically on level ground casts a 120 foot long shadow. The angle of elevation
     from the end of the shadow to the top of the tree is 21.4. Find the height of the tree to the
     nearest foot. With the help of your classmates, research the term umbra versa and see what
     it has to do with the shadow in this problem.

77. The broadcast tower for radio station WSAZ (Home of "Algebra in the Morning with Carl
     and Jeff") has two enormous flashing red lights on it: one at the very top and one a few
     feet below the top. From a point 5000 feet away from the base of the tower on level ground
     the angle of elevation to the top light is 7.970 and to the second light is 7.125. Find the
     distance between the lights to the nearest foot.

78. On page 753 we defined the angle of inclination (also known as the angle of elevation) and in
     this exercise we introduce a related angle - the angle of depression (also known as the angle
     of declination). The angle of depression of an object refers to the angle whose initial side is
     a horizontal line above the object and whose terminal side is the line-of-sight to the object
     below the horizontal. This is represented schematically below.

horizontal       observer
               

                               object

                   The angle of depression from the horizontal to the object is 

(a) Show that if the horizontal is above and parallel to level ground then the angle of
     depression (from observer to object) and the angle of inclination (from object to observer)
     will be congruent because they are alternate interior angles.

     (b) From a firetower 200 feet above level ground in the Sasquatch National Forest, a ranger
          spots a fire off in the distance. The angle of depression to the fire is 2.5. How far away
          from the base of the tower is the fire?

     (c) The ranger in part 78b sees a Sasquatch running directly from the fire towards the
          firetower. The ranger takes two sightings. At the first sighting, the angle of depression
          from the tower to the Sasquatch is 6. The second sighting, taken just 10 seconds later,
          gives the the angle of depression as 6.5. How far did the Saquatch travel in those 10
          seconds? Round your answer to the nearest foot. How fast is it running in miles per
          hour? Round your answer to the nearest mile per hour. If the Sasquatch keeps up this
          pace, how long will it take for the Sasquatch to reach the firetower from his location at
          the second sighting? Round your answer to the nearest minute.

79. When I stand 30 feet away from a tree at home, the angle of elevation to the top of the tree
     is 50 and the angle of depression to the base of the tree is 10. What is the height of the
     tree? Round your answer to the nearest foot.

80. From the observation deck of the lighthouse at Sasquatch Point 50 feet above the surface of
     Lake Ippizuti, a lifeguard spots a boat out on the lake sailing directly toward the lighthouse.
     The first sighting had an angle of depression of 8.2 and the second sighting had an angle of
     depression of 25.9. How far had the boat traveled between the sightings?

81. A guy wire 1000 feet long is attached to the top of a tower. When pulled taut it makes a 43
     angle with the ground. How tall is the tower? How far away from the base of the tower does
     the wire hit the ground?

10.4 Trigonometric Identities

In Section 10.3, we saw the utility of the Pythagorean Identities in Theorem 10.8 along with the
Quotient and Reciprocal Identities in Theorem 10.6. Not only did these identities help us compute
the values of the circular functions for angles, they were also useful in simplifying expressions
involving the circular functions. In this section, we introduce several collections of identities which
have uses in this course and beyond. Our first set of identities is the `Even / Odd' identities.1

Theorem 10.12. Even / Odd Identities: For all applicable angles ,

      cos(-) = cos()            sin(-) = - sin()             tan(-) = - tan()

      sec(-) = sec()            csc(-) = - csc()             cot(-) = - cot()

In light of the Quotient and Reciprocal Identities, Theorem 10.6, it suffices to show cos(-) = cos()
and sin(-) = - sin(). The remaining four circular functions can be expressed in terms of cos()
and sin() so the proofs of their Even / Odd Identities are left as exercises. Consider an angle 
plotted in standard position. Let 0 be the angle coterminal with  with 0  0 < 2. (We can
construct the angle 0 by rotating counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis to the terminal side
of  as pictured below.) Since  and 0 are coterminal, cos() = cos(0) and sin() = sin(0).

                      y                                            y

                         1                                                      1

     0                                                      0

                            1           P (cos(0), sin(0))                         1x
                               x

                                     Q(cos(-0), sin(-0))

                                                  -0

We now consider the angles - and -0. Since  is coterminal with 0, there is some integer k so
that  = 0 + 2 · k. Therefore, - = -0 - 2 · k = -0 + 2 · (-k). Since k is an integer, so is
(-k), which means - is coterminal with -0. Hence, cos(-) = cos(-0) and sin(-) = sin(-0).
Let P and Q denote the points on the terminal sides of 0 and -0, respectively, which lie on the
Unit Circle. By definition, the coordinates of P are (cos(0), sin(0)) and the coordinates of Q are
(cos(-0), sin(-0)). Since 0 and -0 sweep out congruent central sectors of the Unit Circle, it

    1As mentioned at the end of Section 10.2, properties of the circular functions when thought of as functions of
angles in radian measure hold equally well if we view these functions as functions of real numbers. Not surprisingly,
the Even / Odd properties of the circular functions are so named because they identify cosine and secant as even
functions, while the remaining four circular functions are odd. (See Section 1.6.)
10.4 Trigonometric Identities                                                      771

follows that the points P and Q are symmetric about the x-axis. Thus, cos(-0) = cos(0) and
sin(-0) = - sin(0). Since the cosines and sines of 0 and -0 are the same as those for  and
-, respectively, we get cos(-) = cos() and sin(-) = - sin(), as required. The Even / Odd
Identities are readily demonstrated using any of the `common angles' noted in Section 10.2. Their
true utility, however, lies not in computation, but in simplifying expressions involving the circular
functions. In fact, our next batch of identities makes heavy use of the Even / Odd Identities.

 Theorem 10.13. Sum and Difference Identities for Cosine: For all angles  and ,

 cos( + ) = cos() cos() - sin() sin()

 cos( - ) = cos() cos() + sin() sin()

We first prove the result for differences. As in the proof of the Even / Odd Identities, we can reduce

the proof for general angles  and  to angles 0 and 0, coterminal with  and , respectively,

each of which measure between 0 and 2 radians. Since  and 0 are coterminal, as are  and 0,

it follows that  -  is coterminal with 0 - 0. Consider the case below where 0  0.

                    y                                 y

P (cos(0), sin(0))                                    1
                                                               A(cos(0 - 0), sin(0 - 0))

                    0 - 0          Q(cos(0), sin(0))

                         0         1x                       0 - 0  B(1, 0) x
                                0                     O

                    O

Since the angles P OQ and AOB are congruent, the distance between P and Q is equal to the
distance between A and B.2 The distance formula, Equation 1.1, yields

      (cos(0) - cos(0))2 + (sin(0) - sin(0))2 = (cos(0 - 0) - 1)2 + (sin(0 - 0) - 0)2

Squaring both sides, we expand the left hand side of this equation as

      (cos(0) - cos(0))2 + (sin(0) - sin(0))2 = cos2(0) - 2 cos(0) cos(0) + cos2(0)
                                                                     + sin2(0) - 2 sin(0) sin(0) + sin2(0)

                                                                = cos2(0) + sin2(0) + cos2(0) + sin2(0)
                                                                     -2 cos(0) cos(0) - 2 sin(0) sin(0)

    2In the picture we've drawn, the triangles P OQ and AOB are congruent, which is even better. However, 0 - 0
could be 0 or it could be , neither of which makes a triangle. It could also be larger than , which makes a triangle,
just not the one we've drawn. You should think about those three cases.
772                                                Foundations of Trigonometry

From the Pythagorean Identities, cos2(0) + sin2(0) = 1 and cos2(0) + sin2(0) = 1, so
       (cos(0) - cos(0))2 + (sin(0) - sin(0))2 = 2 - 2 cos(0) cos(0) - 2 sin(0) sin(0)

Turning our attention to the right hand side of our equation, we find

 (cos(0 - 0) - 1)2 + (sin(0 - 0) - 0)2 = cos2(0 - 0) - 2 cos(0 - 0) + 1 + sin2(0 - 0)
                                                         = 1 + cos2(0 - 0) + sin2(0 - 0) - 2 cos(0 - 0)

Once again, we simplify cos2(0 - 0) + sin2(0 - 0) = 1, so that

                      (cos(0 - 0) - 1)2 + (sin(0 - 0) - 0)2 = 2 - 2 cos(0 - 0)

Putting it all together, we get 2 - 2 cos(0) cos(0) - 2 sin(0) sin(0) = 2 - 2 cos(0 - 0), which
simplifies to: cos(0 - 0) = cos(0) cos(0) + sin(0) sin(0). Since  and 0,  and 0 and  - 
and 0 - 0 are all coterminal pairs of angles, we have cos( - ) = cos() cos() + sin() sin().
For the case where 0  0, we can apply the above argument to the angle 0 - 0 to obtain the
identity cos(0 - 0) = cos(0) cos(0) + sin(0) sin(0). Applying the Even Identity of cosine, we
get cos(0 - 0) = cos(-(0 - 0)) = cos(0 - 0), and we get the identity in this case, too.

To get the sum identity for cosine, we use the difference formula along with the Even/Odd Identities

  cos( + ) = cos( - (-)) = cos() cos(-) + sin() sin(-) = cos() cos() - sin() sin()
We put these newfound identities to good use in the following example.
Example 10.4.1.

   1. Find the exact value of cos (15).
   2. Verify the identity: cos 2 -  = sin().
Solution.

1. In order to use Theorem 10.13 to find cos (15), we need to write 15 as a sum or difference
   of angles whose cosines and sines we know. One way to do so is to write 15 = 45 - 30.

     cos (15) = cos (45 - 30)

     = cos (45) cos (30) + sin (45) sin (30)
                                                 
     = 2 3+ 2 1
     2                                        2  22

          
     = 6+ 2

2. In a straightforward application of Theorem 10.13, we find

                          cos  -       = cos  cos () + sin  sin ()
                                2                   2              2

                                       = (0) (cos()) + (1) (sin())

                                       = sin()

The identity verified in Example 10.4.1, namely, cos 2 -  = sin(), is the first of the celebrated

`cofunction' identities. These identities were first hinted at in Exercise 74 in Section 10.2. From

sin() = cos     -  ,  we  get:
             2

                          sin  -  = cos  -  -                   = cos(),
                                2               22

which says, in words, that the `co'sine of an angle is the sine of its `co'mplement. Now that these

identities have been established for cosine and sine, the remaining circular functions follow suit.

The remaining proofs are left as exercises.

Theorem 10.14. Cofunction Identities: For all applicable angles ,

 cos          -    = sin()          sec          -     = csc()         tan   -  = cot()
 sin         2     = cos()          csc         2      = sec()         cot  2   = tan()
              -                                  -                           -
             2                                  2                           2

With the Cofunction Identities in place, we are now in the position to derive the sum and difference
formulas for sine. To derive the sum formula for sine, we convert to cosines using a cofunction
identity, then expand using the difference formula for cosine

                      sin( + ) = cos  - ( + )
                                                  2

                                = cos         - -
                                             2

                                = cos  -  cos() + sin  -  sin()
                                             2                  2

                                = sin() cos() + cos() sin()

We can derive the difference formula for sine by rewriting sin( - ) as sin( + (-)) and using
the sum formula and the Even / Odd Identities. Again, we leave the details to the reader.

                                 12

2. If  is a Quadrant II angle with sin() = 513 , and  is a Quadrant III angle with tan() = 2,
   find sin( - ).

3. Derive a formula for tan( + ) in terms of tan() and tan().

Solution.

1.   As in Example 10.4.1, we need to write the angle    19  as a sum or difference of common angles.
                                                         12

     The denominator of 12 suggests a combination of angles with denominators 3 and 4. One

     such combination is  19  =  4  +  4 .  Applying  Theorem  10.15,    we   get
                          12     3

                 sin 19              = sin 4 + 
                        12                       34

                                     = sin 4 cos  + cos 4 sin 
                                              3          4               3         4
                                                                            
                                     = - 3 2 + -1 2
                                              2       2        22

                                            
                                     = - 6- 2

                                                4

2. In order to find sin( - ) using Theorem 10.15, we need to find cos() and both cos()

     and sin(). To find cos(), we use the Pythagorean Identity cos2() + sin2() = 1. Since

     sin() = 513 , we have cos2() +    5    2 = 1, or cos() = ± 12 13 .  Since  is a Quadrant II angle,
                                       13
     cos() = - 12 13 . We now set about finding cos() and sin(). We have several ways to proceed,
     but the Pythagorean Identity 1 + tan2() = sec2() is a quick way to get sec(), and hence,
     cos(). With tan() = 2, we get 1 + 22 = sec2() so that sec() = ± 5. Since  is a
     Quadrant III angle, we choose sec() = -5 so cos() = sec1() = -1 5 = - 55 . We now need

     to determine sin(). We could use The Pythagorean Identity cos2() + sin2() = 1, but we

     opt instead to use a quotient identity. From tan() = cos() sin() , we have sin() = tan() cos()
                                            
     so we get sin() = (2) - 55 = - 2 5 5 . We now have all the pieces needed to find sin( - ):

                          sin( - ) = sin() cos() - cos() sin()
                                                                              
                                     = 5 - 5 - - 12 - 2 5
                                              13 5             13             5

                                     = - 29 5
                                              65

   3. We can start expanding tan( + ) using a quotient identity and our sum formulas
                                      tan( + ) = sin( + )
                                                             cos( + )
                                                       = sin() cos() + cos() sin()
                                                             cos() cos() - sin() sin()

       Since tan() = cos() sin() and tan() = cos() sin() , it looks as though if we divide both numerator and
       denominator by cos() cos() we will have what we want

                                                                                                   1
                            tan( + ) = sin() cos() + cos() sin() cos() cos() - sin() sin() · cos() cos() 1

                                                                                           cos() cos()

                                                   sin() cos() + cos() sin()
                                             = cos() cos() cos() cos()

                                                   cos() cos() - sin() sin()
                                                   cos() cos() cos() cos()
                                                   sin()$co$s($$) $co$s($$) sin()
                                                   cos()$co$s($$) + $co$s($$) cos()
                                             = $co$s($$)$co$s($$) sin() sin()
                                                  $co$s($$)$co$s($$) - cos() cos()

                                             = tan() + tan()
                                                  1 - tan() tan()

       Naturally, this formula is limited to those cases where all of the tangents are defined.

The formula developed in Exercise 10.4.2 for tan( +) can be used to find a formula for tan( -)
by rewriting the difference as a sum, tan(+(-)), and the reader is encouraged to fill in the details.
Below we summarize all of the sum and difference formulas for cosine, sine and tangent.

 Theorem 10.16. Sum and Difference Identities: For all applicable angles  and ,

       cos( ± ) = cos() cos()  sin() sin()

       sin( ± ) = sin() cos() ± cos() sin()
       tan( ± ) = tan() ± tan()

                           1  tan() tan()
In the statement of Theorem 10.16, we have combined the cases for the sum `+' and difference `-'
of angles into one formula. The convention here is that if you want the formula for the sum `+' of
776                         Foundations of Trigonometry

two angles, you use the top sign in the formula; for the difference, `-', use the bottom sign. For
example,

                                            tan( - ) = tan() - tan()
                                                              1 + tan() tan()

If we specialize the sum formulas in Theorem 10.16 to the case when  = , we obtain the following
`Double Angle' Identities.

 Theorem 10.17. Double Angle Identities: For all applicable angles ,
                       cos2() - sin2()

       cos(2) =  2 cos2() - 1
                          1 - 2 sin2()

       sin(2) = 2 sin() cos()

       tan(2) = 1 - tan2 2 tan()()

The three different forms for cos(2) can be explained by our ability to `exchange' squares of cosine
and sine via the Pythagorean Identity cos2() + sin2() = 1 and we leave the details to the reader.
It is interesting to note that to determine the value of cos(2), only one piece of information is
required: either cos() or sin(). To determine sin(2), however, it appears that we must know
both sin() and cos(). In the next example, we show how we can find sin(2) knowing just one
piece of information, namely tan().

Example 10.4.3.

1. Suppose P (-3, 4) lies on the terminal side of  when  is plotted in standard position. Find
   cos(2) and sin(2) and determine the quadrant in which the terminal side of the angle 2
   lies when it is plotted in standard position.

2. If sin() = x for - 2    2 , find an expression for sin(2) in terms of x.

3. Verify the identity: sin(2) = 1 + tan2 2 tan()() .

4. Express cos(3) as a polynomial in terms of cos().

Solution.

1. Using Theorem 10.3 from Section 10.2 with x = -3 and y = 4, we find r = x2 + y2 = 5.

     Hence, cos() = - 35 and sin() = 45 . Applying Theorem 10.17, we get cos(2) = cos2() -
                     2-     2 = - 257 , and sin(2) = 2 sin() cos() = 2
     sin2() =  - 35      4                                              4  - 35 = - 24 25 . Since both
                         5                                              5

     cosine and sine of 2 are negative, the terminal side of 2, when plotted in standard position,

     lies in Quadrant III.

2. If your first reaction to `sin() = x' is `No it's not, cos() = x!' then you have indeed learned

something, and we take comfort in that. However, context is everything. Here, `x' is just a

variable - it does not necessarily represent the x-coordinate of the point on The Unit Circle

which lies on the terminal side of , assuming  is drawn in standard position. Here, x

represents the quantity sin(), and what we wish to know is how to express sin(2) in terms

of x. We will see more of this kind of thing in Section 10.6, and, as usual, this is something we

need for Calculus. Since sin(2) = 2 sin() cos(), we need to write cos() in terms of x to finish

the problem. We substitute x = sin() into the Pythagorean Identity, cos2() + sin2() = 1,
to get cos2() + x2 = 1, or cos() = ± 1 - x2. Since - 2    2 , cos()  0, and thus
                                                 
cos() = 1 - x2. Our final answer is sin(2) = 2 sin() cos() = 2x 1 - x2.

3. We start with the right hand side of the identity and note that 1 + tan2() = sec2(). From
   this point, we use the Reciprocal and Quotient Identities to rewrite tan() and sec() in terms
   of cos() and sin():

  2 tan()                      2 tan()  2 sin()  = 2 sin() cos2()
                                        cos()           cos()
  1 + tan2() = sec2() =
                                        1

                                        cos2()

                               sin()    $
           =2                  $ $co$s() cos() = 2 sin() cos() = sin(2)
                               $co$s()

4. In Theorem 10.17, one of the formulas for cos(2), namely cos(2) = 2 cos2() - 1, expresses
   cos(2) as a polynomial in terms of cos(). We are now asked to find such an identity for
   cos(3). Using the sum formula for cosine, we begin with

                                     cos(3) = cos(2 + )
                                                 = cos(2) cos() - sin(2) sin()

Our ultimate goal is to express the right hand side in terms of cos() only. We substitute
cos(2) = 2 cos2() - 1 and sin(2) = 2 sin() cos() which yields

                      cos(3) = cos(2) cos() - sin(2) sin()
                                  = 2 cos2() - 1 cos() - (2 sin() cos()) sin()
                                  = 2 cos3() - cos() - 2 sin2() cos()

Finally, we exchange sin2() for 1 - cos2() courtesy of the Pythagorean Identity, and get

                         cos(3) = 2 cos3() - cos() - 2 sin2() cos()
                                     = 2 cos3() - cos() - 2 1 - cos2() cos()
                                     = 2 cos3() - cos() - 2 cos() + 2 cos3()
                                     = 4 cos3() - 3 cos()

and we are done.
778                                                     Foundations of Trigonometry

In the last problem in Example 10.4.3, we saw how we could rewrite cos(3) as sums of powers of
cos(). In Calculus, we have occasion to do the reverse; that is, reduce the power of cosine and
sine. Solving the identity cos(2) = 2 cos2() - 1 for cos2() and the identity cos(2) = 1 - 2 sin2()
for sin2() results in the aptly-named `Power Reduction' formulas below.

 Theorem 10.18. Power Reduction Formulas: For all angles ,

       cos2() = 1 + cos(2)
                             2

       sin2() = 1 - cos(2)
                             2

Example 10.4.4. Rewrite sin2() cos2() as a sum and difference of cosines to the first power.
Solution. We begin with a straightforward application of Theorem 10.18

     sin2() cos2() =                       1 - cos(2)   1 + cos(2)
                                                 2            2

                                       = 1 1 - cos2(2)
                                            4

                                       = 1 - 1 cos2(2)
                                            44

Next, we apply the power reduction formula to cos2(2) to finish the reduction

     sin2() cos2() = 1 - 1 cos2(2)
                               44

                                       = 1 - 1 1 + cos(2(2))
                                              44        2

                                       = 1 - 1 - 1 cos(4)
                                            488

                                       = 1 - 1 cos(4)
                                            88

Another application of the Power Reduction Formulas is the Half Angle Formulas. To start, we

apply the Power Reduction Formula to cos2  
                                           2

     cos2  = 1 + cos 2 2                          = 1 + cos() .
                                    2         2            2

We can obtain a formula for cos        by extracting square roots. In a similar fashion, we may obtain
                                 2

a half angle formula for sine, and by using a quotient formula, obtain a half angle formula for

tangent. We summarize these formulas below.
10.4 Trigonometric Identities                                                                                      779

Theorem 10.19. Half Angle Formulas: For all applicable angles ,

     cos  = ± 1 + cos()
             2                 2

     sin  = ± 1 - cos()
           2               2

     tan  = ± 1 - cos()
             2          1 + cos()

where the choice of ± depends on the quadrant in which the terminal side of  lies.
                                                                                                       2

Example 10.4.5.

1. Use a half angle formula to find the exact value of cos (15).

2.  Suppose     -       0  with     cos()   =  -    3  .  Find  sin        .
                                                    5                   2

3. Use the identity given in number 3 of Example 10.4.3 to derive the identity

                                               tan  = sin()
                                                      2 1 + cos()

Solution.

1.  To  use  the  half  angle  formula,    we  note       that  15   =     30  and  since  15  is  a  Quadrant  I  angle,
                                                                            2

    its cosine is positive. Thus we have

                         cos (15) = + 1 + cos (30) =

    Back in Example 10.4.1, we foundcos(15) by using the difference formula for cosine. In that

    expressions are equal.

3. Instead of our usual approach to verifying identities, namely starting with one side of the

     equation and trying to transform it into the other, we will start with the identity we proved

     in number 3 of Example 10.4.3 and manipulate it into the identity we are asked to prove. The
     identity we are asked to start with is sin(2) = 1+tan2() 2 tan() . If we are to use this to derive an

     identity for tan     ,  it  seems  reasonable  to  proceed  by     replacing   each  occurrence  of    with  
                       2                                                                                          2

                                        sin  2          =        2 tan  
                                                 2                      2

                                                                        2
                                                              1 + tan 2

                                             sin() =             2 tan  
                                                                        2

                                                                        2

     We now have the sin() we need, but we somehow need to get a factor of 1 + cos() involved.

     To get cosines involved, recall that 1 + tan2            = sec2          .  We continue to manipulate our
                                                           2            2

Our next batch of identities, the Product to Sum Formulas,3 are easily verified by expanding each
of the right hand sides in accordance with Theorem 10.16 and as you should expect by now we leave
the details as exercises. They are of particular use in Calculus, and we list them here for reference.

 Theorem 10.20. Product to Sum Formulas: For all angles  and ,

       cos() cos() =   1  [cos(  -  )   +  cos(  +  )]
                       2

       sin() sin() =   1  [cos(  -  )   -  cos(  +  )]
                       2

       sin() cos() =   1  [sin(  -  )   +  sin(  +  )]
                       2

    3These are also known as the Prosthaphaeresis Formulas and have a rich history. The authors recommend that
you conduct some research on them as your schedule allows.

Related to the Product to Sum Formulas are the Sum to Product Formulas, which we will have
need of in Section 10.7. These are easily verified using the Product to Sum Formulas, and as such,
their proofs are left as exercises.

 Theorem 10.21. Sum to Product Formulas: For all angles  and ,

 cos() + cos() = 2 cos  +  cos  - 
                 2                        2

 cos() - cos() = -2 sin  +  sin  - 
                               2             2

 sin() ± sin() = 2 sin  ±  cos   
                 2                        2

Example 10.4.6.

1. Write cos(2) cos(6) as a sum.
2. Write sin() - sin(3) as a product.

Solution.

1. Identifying  = 2 and  = 6, we find

                 cos(2) cos(6)         =  1  [cos(2  -  6)    +  cos(2  +  6)]
                                          2

                                       =  1  cos(-4)    +  1  cos(8)
                                          2                2

                                       =  1  cos(4)  +  1  cos(8),
                                          2             2

where the last equality is courtesy of the even identity for cosine, cos(-4) = cos(4).

2. Identifying  =  and  = 3 yields

                 sin() - sin(3) = 2 sin  - 3 cos  + 3
                                                     2                  2

                                       = 2 sin (-) cos (2)

                                       = -2 sin () cos (2) ,

where the last equality is courtesy of the odd identity for sine, sin(-) = - sin().

The reader is reminded that all of the identities presented in this section which regard the circular
functions as functions of angles (in radian measure) apply equally well to the circular (trigonometric)
functions regarded as functions of real numbers. In Exercises 38 - 43 in Section 10.5, we see how some
of these identities manifest themselves geometrically as we study the graphs of the these functions.
In the upcoming Exercises, however, you need to do all of your work analytically without graphs.

10.5 Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions

In this section, we return to our discussion of the circular (trigonometric) functions as functions of
real numbers and pick up where we left off in Sections 10.2.1 and 10.3.1. As usual, we begin our
study with the functions f (t) = cos(t) and g(t) = sin(t).

10.5.1 Graphs of the Cosine and Sine Functions

From Theorem 10.5 in Section 10.2.1, we know that the domain of f (t) = cos(t) and of g(t) = sin(t)
is all real numbers, (-, ), and the range of both functions is [-1, 1]. The Even / Odd Identities
in Theorem 10.12 tell us cos(-t) = cos(t) for all real numbers t and sin(-t) = - sin(t) for all
real numbers t. This means f (t) = cos(t) is an even function, while g(t) = sin(t) is an odd
function.1 Another important property of these functions is that for coterminal angles  and ,
cos() = cos() and sin() = sin(). Said differently, cos(t+2k) = cos(t) and sin(t+2k) = sin(t)
for all real numbers t and any integer k. This last property is given a special name.

 Definition 10.3. Periodic Functions: A function f is said to be periodic if there is a real
 number c so that f (t + c) = f (t) for all real numbers t in the domain of f . The smallest positive
 number p for which f (t + p) = f (t) for all real numbers t in the domain of f , if it exists, is called
 the period of f .

We have already seen a family of periodic functions in Section 2.1: the constant functions. However,
despite being periodic a constant function has no period. (We'll leave that odd gem as an exercise
for you.) Returning to the circular functions, we see that by Definition 10.3, f (t) = cos(t) is
periodic, since cos(t + 2k) = cos(t) for any integer k. To determine the period of f , we need to
find the smallest real number p so that f (t + p) = f (t) for all real numbers t or, said differently,
the smallest positive real number p such that cos(t + p) = cos(t) for all real numbers t. We know
that cos(t + 2) = cos(t) for all real numbers t but the question remains if any smaller real number
will do the trick. Suppose p > 0 and cos(t + p) = cos(t) for all real numbers t. Then, in particular,
cos(0 + p) = cos(0) so that cos(p) = 1. From this we know p is a multiple of 2 and, since the
smallest positive multiple of 2 is 2 itself, we have the result. Similarly, we can show g(t) = sin(t)
is also periodic with 2 as its period.2 Having period 2 essentially means that we can completely
understand everything about the functions f (t) = cos(t) and g(t) = sin(t) by studying one interval
of length 2, say [0, 2].3

One last property of the functions f (t) = cos(t) and g(t) = sin(t) is worth pointing out: both of
these functions are continuous and smooth. Recall from Section 3.1 that geometrically this means
the graphs of the cosine and sine functions have no jumps, gaps, holes in the graph, asymptotes,

    1See section 1.6 for a review of these concepts.
    2Alternatively, we can use the Cofunction Identities in Theorem 10.14 to show that g(t) = sin(t) is periodic with
period 2 since g(t) = sin(t) = cos 2 - t = f 2 - t .
    3Technically, we should study the interval [0, 2),4since whatever happens at t = 2 is the same as what happens
at t = 0. As we will see shortly, t = 2 gives us an extra `check' when we go to graph these functions.
    4In some advanced texts, the interval of choice is [-, ).

corners or cusps. As we shall see, the graphs of both f (t) = cos(t) and g(t) = sin(t) meander nicely
and don't cause any trouble. We summarize these facts in the following theorem.

 Theorem 10.22. Properties of the Cosine and Sine Functions

In the chart above, we followed the convention established in Section 1.6 and used x as the indepen-
dent variable and y as the dependent variable.5 This allows us to turn our attention to graphing
the cosine and sine functions in the Cartesian Plane. To graph y = cos(x), we make a table as we
did in Section 1.6 using some of the `common values' of x in the interval [0, 2]. This generates a
portion of the cosine graph, which we call the `fundamental cycle' of y = cos(x).

A few things about the graph above are worth mentioning. First, this graph represents only part
of the graph of y = cos(x). To get the entire graph, we imagine `copying and pasting' this graph
end to end infinitely in both directions (left and right) on the x-axis. Secondly, the vertical scale
here has been greatly exaggerated for clarity and aesthetics. Below is an accurate-to-scale graph of
y = cos(x) showing several cycles with the `fundamental cycle' plotted thicker than the others. The

    5The use of x and y in this context is not to be confused with the x- and y-coordinates of points on the Unit Circle
which define cosine and sine. Using the term `trigonometric function' as opposed to `circular function' can help with
that, but one could then ask, "Hey, where's the triangle?"

graph of y = cos(x) is usually described as `wavelike' - indeed, many of the applications involving
the cosine and sine functions feature modeling wavelike phenomena.

As with the graph of y = cos(x), we provide an accurately scaled graph of y = sin(x) below with
the fundamental cycle highlighted.

                                                                                          y

                                                                                                         x

                                     An accurately scaled graph of y = sin(x).

It is no accident that the graphs of y = cos(x) and y = sin(x) are so similar. Using a cofunction
identity along with the even property of cosine, we have

                         sin(x) = cos  - x = cos - x -                        = cos x - 
                                       2                            2                        2

Recalling Section 1.7, we see from this formula that the graph of y = sin(x) is the result of shifting

the  graph  of  y  =  cos(x)  to  the  right     units.  A  visual  inspection  confirms  this.
                                              2

Now that we know the basic shapes of the graphs of y = cos(x) and y = sin(x), we can use
Theorem 1.7 in Section 1.7 to graph more complicated curves. To do so, we need to keep track of
10.5 Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions                                                                793

the movement of some key points on the original graphs. We choose to track the values x = 0, 2 , ,

2  and  2.  These    `quarter  marks'  correspond  to  quadrantal  angles,  and  as  such,     mark  the  location

of the zeros and the local extrema of these functions over exactly one period. Before we begin our

next example, we need to review the concept of the `argument' of a function as first introduced

in Section 1.4. For the function f (x) = 1 - 5 cos(2x - ), the argument of f is x. We shall have

occasion, however, to refer to the argument of the cosine, which in this case is 2x - . Loosely

stated, the argument of a trigonometric function is the expression `inside' the function.

Example 10.5.1. Graph one cycle of the following functions. State the period of each.

   1. f (x) = 3 cos  x-    +1                          2.  g(x) =     1  sin(  -  2x)  +    3
                        2                                             2                     2

Solution.

   1. We set the argument of the cosine, 2 x- , equal to each of the values: 0, 2 , , 32 , 2 and
      solve for x. We summarize the results below.

                                                         a x- 2 = a x
                                                         0 x- 2 = 0 1
                                                         2 2  x- = 2 2
                                                          x- 2 =  3
                                                        2 2 3 x- = 23 4
                                                       2 x- 2 = 2 5

   Next, we substitute each of these x values into f (x) = 3 cos            x-         + 1 to determine the
                                                                               2

   One cycle is graphed on [1, 5] so the period is the length of that interval which is 4.

   2. Proceeding as above, we set the argument of the sine,  - 2x, equal to each of our quarter
      marks and solve for x.

                                                  2  - 2x =   2 4

                                                    - 2x =  0

                                            2  - 2x = 2 - 2

     We now find the corresponding y-values on the graph by substituting each of these x-values

     into  g(x)  =  1  sin(  - 2x) +  32 .  Once  again,  we  connect  the   dots   in  a  wavelike  fashion.

The functions in Example 10.5.1 are examples of sinusoids. Roughly speaking, a sinusoid is
the result of taking the basic graph of f (x) = cos(x) or g(x) = sin(x) and performing any of
the transformations6 mentioned in Section 1.7. Sinusoids can be characterized by four properties:
period, amplitude, phase shift and vertical shift. We have already discussed period, that is, how
long it takes for the sinusoid to complete one cycle. The standard period of both f (x) = cos(x) and
g(x) = sin(x) is 2, but horizontal scalings will change the period of the resulting sinusoid. The
amplitude of the sinusoid is a measure of how `tall' the wave is, as indicated in the figure below.
The amplitude of the standard cosine and sine functions is 1, but vertical scalings can alter this.

    6We have already seen how the Even/Odd and Cofunction Identities can be used to rewrite g(x) = sin(x) as a
transformed version of f (x) = cos(x), so of course, the reverse is true: f (x) = cos(x) can be written as a transformed
version of g(x) = sin(x). The authors have seen some instances where sinusoids are always converted to cosine
functions while in other disciplines, the sinusoids are always written in terms of sine functions. We will discuss the
applications of sinusoids in greater detail in Chapter 11. Until then, we will keep our options open.
10.5 Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions                                                                              795

                                    amplitude

                                                                      baseline

                                                        period

The phase shift of the sinusoid is the horizontal shift experienced by the fundamental cycle. We

have  seen  that  a  phase  (horizontal)  shift  of     to  the  right  takes    f (x)  =  cos(x)  to  g(x)  =  sin(x)  since
                                                     2
cos x - 2                                                                        
            =     sin(x).  As  the  reader  can  verify,    a  phase  shift  of  2  to  the  left  takes  g(x)  =  sin(x)  to

f (x) = cos(x). The vertical shift of a sinusoid is exactly the same as the vertical shifts in Section

1.7. In most contexts, the vertical shift of a sinusoid is assumed to be 0, but we state the more

general case below. The following theorem, which is reminiscent of Theorem 1.7 in Section 1.7,

shows how to find these four fundamental quantities from the formula of the given sinusoid.

Theorem 10.23. For  > 0, the functions

                     C(x) = A cos(x + ) + B and S(x) = A sin(x + ) + B

       have period 2                                              have phase shift - 
                                                                                            

       have amplitude |A|                                         have vertical shift B

We note that in some scientific and engineering circles, the quantity  mentioned in Theorem 10.23
is called the phase of the sinusoid. Since our interest in this book is primarily with graphing
sinusoids, we focus our attention on the horizontal shift -  induced by .

The proof of Theorem 10.23 is a direct application of Theorem 1.7 in Section 1.7 and is left to the
reader. The parameter , which is stipulated to be positive, is called the (angular) frequency of
the sinusoid and is the number of cycles the sinusoid completes over a 2 interval. We can always
ensure  > 0 using the Even/Odd Identities.7 We now test out Theorem 10.23 using the functions
f and g featured in Example 10.5.1. First, we write f (x) in the form prescribed in Theorem 10.23,

                           f (x) = 3 cos x -  + 1 = 3 cos  x + -  + 1,
                                            2                           2               2

7Try using the formulas in Theorem 10.23 applied to C(x) = cos(-x + ) to see why we need  > 0.
796                                                                                                   Foundations of Trigonometry

so that A = 3,  = 2 ,  = - 2 and B = 1. According to Theorem 10.23, the period of f is
                                                                                                                          - /2 -/2
2  =  2        =  4,  the  amplitude  is    |A|   =            |3|  =  3,    the      phase  shift       is  -         =            =  1  (indicating
      /2

a shift to the right 1 unit) and the vertical shift is B = 1 (indicating a shift up 1 unit.) All of

these match with our graph of y = f (x). Moreover, if we start with the basic shape of the cosine

graph, shift it 1 unit to the right, 1 unit up, stretch the amplitude to 3 and shrink the period

to 4, we will have reconstructed one period of the graph of y = f (x). In other words, instead of

tracking the five `quarter marks' through the transformations to plot y = f (x), we can use five

other pieces of information: the phase shift, vertical shift, amplitude, period and basic shape of the

cosine curve. Turning our attention now to the function g in Example 10.5.1, we first need to use

the odd property of the sine function to write it in the form required by Theorem 10.23

g(x) = 1 sin( - 2x) + 3 = 1 sin(-(2x - )) + 3 = - 1 sin(2x - ) + 3 = - 1 sin(2x + (-)) + 3
         2                 22                                                22                                     22                                2

We find A = - 12 ,  = 2,  = - and B = 32 .                                            The    period   is    then       2  = , the amplitude is
                                                                                                                       2
- 12     12 ,                         - -2                                                            
      =        the  phase  shift  is        =  2               (indicating      a     shift  right    2  units)        and  the  vertical  shift  is  up

32 . Note that, in this case, all of the data match our graph of y = g(x) with the exception of the
phase shift. Instead of the graph starting at x = 2 , it ends there. Remember, however, that the

graph presented in Example 10.5.1 is only one portion of the graph of y = g(x). Indeed, another

complete cycle begins at x = 2 , and this is the cycle Theorem 10.23 is detecting. The reason for the
discrepancy is that, in order to apply Theorem 10.23, we had to rewrite the formula for g(x) using

the odd property of the sine function. Note that whether we graph y = g(x) using the `quarter

marks' approach or using the Theorem 10.23, we get one complete cycle of the graph, which means

we have completely determined the sinusoid.

Example 10.5.2. Below is the graph of one complete cycle of a sinusoid y = f (x).

   2. Find a sine function whose graph matches the graph of y = f (x).

Solution.

   1. We fit the data to a function of the form C(x) = A cos(x + ) + B. Since one cycle is

      graphed over the interval [-1, 5], its period is 5 - (-1) = 6. According to Theorem 10.23,

      6 = 2 , so that  = 3 . Next, we see that the phase shift is -1, so we have -  = -1, or
       =  = 3 . To find the amplitude, note that the range of the sinusoid is - 32 , 52 . As a result,
                                 1         52 -     - 32      = 21 (4) = 2. Finally, to determine the vertical shift, we
      the  amplitude  A     =    2

      average  the   endpoints             of  the  range     to  find  B    =     1                   52 +   - 32     = 21 (1) = 12 . Our final answer is
                                                                                   2
      C(x) = 2 cos 3 x + 3 + 12 .

   2. Most of the work to fit the data to a function of the form S(x) = A sin(x + ) + B is done.

      The period, amplitude and vertical shift are the same as before with  = 3 , A = 2 and
      B = 12 . The trickier part is finding the phase shift. To that end, we imagine extending the

      graph of the given sinusoid as in the figure below so that we can identify a cycle beginning

      at   27 , 21 . Taking the phase shift to be 72 , we get -  = 72 , or  = - 72  = - 72                                                                  = - 76 .
                                                                                                                                                         3
      Hence, our answer is S(x) = 2 sin 3 x - 76 + 12 .

                                                    Extending the graph of y = f (x).

Note that each of the answers given in Example 10.5.2 is one choice out of many possible answers.

For example, when fitting a sine function to the data, we could have chosen to start at 21 , 21 taking
                                                              1           - 6                                                                         3 x - 6  + 12 .
A  =  -2.  In  this  case,  the  phase         shift      is  2  so    =           for                 an    answer    of      S(x)     =  -2 sin

Alternatively, we could have extended the graph of y = f (x) to the left and considered a sine

function starting at - 52 , 12 , and so on. Each of these formulas determine the same sinusoid curve
and their formulas are all equivalent using identities. Speaking of identities, if we use the sum

identity for cosine, we can expand the formula to yield

               C(x) = A cos(x + ) + B = A cos(x) cos() - A sin(x) sin() + B.
798                                                           Foundations of Trigonometry

Similarly, using the sum identity for sine, we get

             S(x) = A sin(x + ) + B = A sin(x) cos() + A cos(x) sin() + B.

Making these observations allows us to recognize (and graph) functions as sinusoids which, at first

glance, don't appear to fit the forms of either C(x) or S(x).
                                                                              

Example 10.5.3. Consider the function f (x) = cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x). Find a formula for f (x):

1. in the form C(x) = A cos(x + ) + B for  > 0

2. in the form S(x) = A sin(x + ) + B for  > 0

Check your answers analytically using identities and graphically using a calculator.
Solution.

1. The key to this problem is to use the expanded forms of the sinusoid formulas and match up
   corresponding coefficients. Equating f (x) = cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x) with the expanded form of
   C(x) = A cos(x + ) + B, we get

                                    
                       cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x) = A cos(x) cos() - A sin(x) sin() + B

     It should be clear that we can take  = 2 and B = 0 to get

                                  
                     cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x) = A cos(2x) cos() - A sin(2x) sin()

     To determine A and , a bit more work is involved. We get started by equating the coefficients

     of the trigonometric functions on either side of the equation. On the left hand side, the

     coefficient of cos(2x) is 1, while on the right hand side, it is A cos(). Since this equation

     is to hold for all real numbers, we must have8 that A cos() = 1. Similarly, we find by
     equating the coefficients of sin(2x) that A sin() = 3. What we have here is a system

     of nonlinear equations! We can temporarily eliminate the dependence on  by using the

     Pythagorean Identity.  We     know  cos2() + sin2()   =  1,  so  multiplying               this  by  A2  gives
                                                                                                           
     A2 cos2()+A2 sin2() = A2. Since A cos() = 1 and A sin() =            3,          we  get A2   =  12+(    3)2 =
                                                                                              
     4 or A = ±2. Choosing A = 2, we have 2 cos() = 1 and 2 sin() = 3 or, after some
                               1                 32 . One such angle  which satisfies this criteria is
     rearrangement,  cos()  =  2  and  sin()  =

     =  3 .  Hence, one way to write f (x) as a sinusoid is f (x) = 2 cos             2x  +     .  We can easily
                                                                                             3

     check our answer using the sum formula for cosine

                            f (x)  =   2 cos  2x  +  
                                                     3

                                   =   2 cos(2x) cos       - sin(2x) sin  
                                                        3                 3
                                                                  
                                   = 2 cos(2x) 1 2 - sin(2x) 23
                                   = cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x)

8This should remind you of equation coefficients of like powers of x in Section 8.6.
10.5 Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions                        799

                                                                          
2. Proceeding as before, we equate f (x) = cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x) with the expanded form of

   S(x) = A sin(x + ) + B to get

             
cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x) = A sin(x) cos() + A cos(x) sin() + B

Once again, we may take  = 2 and B = 0 so that

                                    
                      cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x) = A sin(2x) cos() + A cos(2x) sin()

We equate9 the coefficients of cos(2x) on either side and get A sin() = 1 and A cos() = -3.
Using A2 cos2() + A2 sin2() = A2 as before, we get A = ±2, and again we choose A =2.

                                                   1 3
This means 2 sin() = 1, or sin() = 2 , and 2 cos() = - 3, which means cos() = - 2 .
One such angle which meets these criteria is  = 56 . Hence, we have f (x) = 2 sin 2x + 56 .
Checking our work analytically, we have

f (x) = 2 sin 2x + 56

=  2 sin(2x) cos                            5   + cos(2x) sin  5
                                            6                  6
                       
              - 32                                         1
=  2 sin(2x)                                    + cos(2x)  2

= cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x)

Graphing the three formulas for f (x) result in the identical curve, verifying our analytic work.

It is important to note that in order for the technique presented in Example 10.5.3 to fit a function
into one of the forms in Theorem10.23, the arguments of the cosine and sinefunction much match.
That is, while f (x) = cos(2x) - 3 sin(2x) is a sinusoid, g(x) = cos(2x) - 3 sin(3x) is not.10 It
is also worth mentioning that, had we chosen A = -2 instead of A = 2 as we worked through
Example 10.5.3, our final answers would have looked different. The reader is encouraged to rework
Example 10.5.3 using A = -2 to see what these differences are, and then for a challenging exercise,
use identities to show that the formulas are all equivalent. The general equations to fit a function
of the form f (x) = a cos(x) + b sin(x) + B into one of the forms in Theorem 10.23 are explored
in Exercise 35.

10.5.2 Graphs of the Secant and Cosecant Functions

We now turn our attention to graphing y = sec(x). Since sec(x) = cos(x) 1 , we can use our table

of values for the graph of y = cos(x) and take reciprocals. We know from Section 10.3.1 that the

domain of F (x) = sec(x) excludes all odd multiples of 2 , and sure enough, we run into trouble at
                    3
x  =  2  and  x  =  2     since  cos(x)  =  0  at    these   values.  Using                               the     notation  introduced    in  Section  4.2,

we have that as x  2 -, cos(x)  0+, so sec(x)  . (See Section 10.3.1 for a more detailed
analysis.) Similarly, we find that as x  2 +, sec(x)  -; as x  23 -, sec(x)  -; and as
x  23 +, sec(x)  . This means we have a pair of vertical asymptotes to the graph of y = sec(x),
                    32 .                                                                                                                   also.11
x=    2  and  x=          Since  cos(x)  is    periodic      with  period                              2,  it  follows  that   sec(x)  is           Below

                                                The graph of y = sec(x).

  11Provided sec() and sec() are defined, sec() = sec() if and only if cos() = cos(). Hence, sec(x) inherits its
period from cos(x).

  12In Section 10.3.1, we argued the range of F (x) = sec(x) is (-, -1]  [1, ). We can now see this graphically.

As one would expect, to graph y = csc(x) we begin with y = sin(x) and take reciprocals of the
corresponding y-values. Here, we encounter issues at x = 0, x =  and x = 2. Proceeding with
the usual analysis, we graph the fundamental cycle of y = csc(x) below along with the dotted graph
of y = sin(x) for reference. Since y = sin(x) and y = cos(x) are merely phase shifts of each other,
so too are y = csc(x) and y = sec(x).

Once again, our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1 is verified geometrically in the graph of
y = G(x) = csc(x).

                                                The graph of y = csc(x).

Note that, on the intervals between the vertical asymptotes, both F (x) = sec(x) and G(x) = csc(x)
are continuous and smooth. In other words, they are continuous and smooth on their domains.13
The following theorem summarizes the properties of the secant and cosecant functions. Note that

  13Just like the rational functions in Chapter 4 are continuous and smooth on their domains because polynomials are
continuous and smooth everywhere, the secant and cosecant functions are continuous and smooth on their domains
since the cosine and sine functions are continuous and smooth everywhere.

all of these properties are direct results of them being reciprocals of the cosine and sine functions,
respectively.

                                                                         k=-

      The function G(x) = csc(x)

          - is continuous and smooth on its domain

          - has period 2

In the next example, we discuss graphing more general secant and cosecant curves.
Example 10.5.4. Graph one cycle of the following functions. State the period of each.

   1. f (x) = 1 - 2 sec(2x)                                 2. g(x) = csc( - x) - 5
Solution.                                                                          3

1. To graph y = 1 - 2 sec(2x), we follow the same procedure as in Example 10.5.1. First, we set

     the  argument  of  secant,  2x,  equal  to  the    `quarter  marks'  0,  2 ,  ,  3  and  2  and  solve  for  x.
                                                                                      2

                                                    a 2x = a x

                                                    0 2x = 0 0

                                                    2 2x =   2 4

                                                            2x =     
                                                                     2

                                                    32 2x = 3 3 2 4

                                                    2 2x = 2 
10.5 Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions                                  803

Next, we substitute these x values into f (x). If f (x) exists, we have a point on the graph;
otherwise, we have found a vertical asymptote. In addition to these points and asymptotes,
we have graphed the associated cosine curve - in this case y = 1 - 2 cos(2x) - dotted in the
picture below. Since one cycle is graphed over the interval [0, ], the period is  - 0 = .

                                                                                                      y

2. Proceeding as before, we set the argument of cosecant in g(x) = 3 csc(-x)-5 equal to the
   quarter marks and solve for x.

                        a  - x = a x

                        0  - x = 0 1
                        2  - x =  1 2 2
                          - x =  0

                       2  - x = 2 -1

Substituting these x-values into g(x), we generate the graph below and find the period to be
1 - (-1) = 2. The associated sine curve, y = 3 sin(-x)-5 , is dotted in as a reference.

                                                                                                                    y

Before moving on, we note that it is possible to speak of the period, phase shift and vertical shift of
secant and cosecant graphs and use even/odd identities to put them in a form similar to the sinusoid
forms mentioned in Theorem 10.23. Since these quantities match those of the corresponding cosine
and sine curves, we do not spell this out explicitly. Finally, since the ranges of secant and cosecant
are unbounded, there is no amplitude associated with these curves.

10.5.3 Graphs of the Tangent and Cotangent Functions

Finally, we turn our attention to the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions. When con-

structing a table of values for the tangent function, we see that J(x) = tan(x) is undefined at

x=      and x =  32 , in accordance with our findings in Section 10.3.1.        As x    2 -, sin(x)  1-

                                         sin(x)
and  cos(x)    0+,  so  that  tan(x)  =  cos(x)      producing  a  vertical  asymptote  at  x  =  2 .  Using  a

similar analysis, we get that as x  2 +, tan(x)  -; as x  23 -, tan(x)  ; and as x  23 +,
tan(x)  -. Plotting this information and performing the usual `copy and paste' produces:

                                                                                                          y

From the graph, it appears as if the tangent function is periodic with period . To prove that this
is the case, we appeal to the sum formula for tangents. We have:

                           tan(x + ) = tan(x) + tan() = tan(x) + 0 = tan(x),
                                             1 - tan(x) tan() 1 - (tan(x))(0)

which tells us the period of tan(x) is at most . To show that it is exactly , suppose p is a

positive real number so that tan(x + p) = tan(x) for all real numbers x. For x = 0, we have

tan(p) = tan(0 + p) = tan(0) = 0, which means p is a multiple of . The smallest positive multiple

of  is  itself, so we have established the result. We take as our fundamental cycle for y = tan(x)

the interval      - 2 , 2  ,  and  use  as  our  `quarter  marks'  x  =   - 2 ,  - 4 ,  0,     and   2 .  From  the  graph,  we
                                                                                            4

see confirmation of our domain and range work in Section 10.3.1.

It should be no surprise that K(x) = cot(x) behaves similarly to J(x) = tan(x). Plotting cot(x)
over the interval [0, 2] results in the graph below.

                                                                                                          y

From these data, it clearly appears as if the period of cot(x) is , and we leave it to the reader

to prove this.14 We take as one fundamental cycle the interval (0, ) with quarter marks: x = 0,

4 ,  2 ,  3  and  .  A     more  complete   graph  of  y   =  cot(x)  is    below,  along      with  the     fundamental  cycle

highlighted as usual. Once again, we see the domain and range of K(x) = cot(x) as read from the

graph matches with what we found analytically in Section 10.3.1.

  14Certainly, mimicking the proof that the period of tan(x) is an option; for another approach, consider transforming
tan(x) to cot(x) using identities.

10.24, each of the results below can be traced back to properties of the cosine and sine functions
and the definition of the tangent and cotangent functions as quotients thereof.

     - has domain   x:x=          + k,  k  is  an  integer           (2k + 1) , (2k + 3)

                                                            =

                                                                k=-

Example 10.5.5. Graph one cycle of the following functions. Find the period.

1. f (x) = 1 - tan      x  .                                      2. g(x) = 2 cot                x  +    + 1.

Solution.

1. We proceed as we have in all of the previous graphing examples by setting the argument of

    tangent in f (x) = 1 - tan        x  ,  namely   x2 ,  equal  to  each  of    the   `quarter         marks'     - 2 ,  - 4 ,  0,  
                                      2                                                                                               4
    and 2 , and solving for x.

                                                    a x2 = a x
                                                  -  x 2 2 = - 2 -
                                                  -  x 4 2 = - 4 - 2

                                                    0 x2 = 0 0
                                                    4 2  x = 4 2  
                                                     x 2 2 = 2 

    Substituting these x-values into f (x), we find points on the graph and the vertical asymptotes.

                                                                                                                            y

                                                                                                         2

                      undefined

                                                                      One cycle of y = 1 - tan                   x    .
                                                                                                                 2

    We see that the period is  - (-) = 2.

2.  The    `quarter  marks'   for  the  fundamental        cycle  of  the  cotangent      curve         are  0,  4 ,  2 ,  3  and     .
                                                                                                                           4
                                                                               
    To graph g(x) = 2 cot     2    x  +     + 1,  we  begin  by       setting  2  x  +           equal   to  each     quarter  mark

    and solving for x.

     We find the period to be 0 - (-2) = 2.

As with the secant and cosecant functions, it is possible to extend the notion of period, phase shift
and vertical shift to the tangent and cotangent functions as we did for the cosine and sine functions
in Theorem 10.23. Since the number of classical applications involving sinusoids far outnumber
those involving tangent and cotangent functions, we omit this. The ambitious reader is invited to
formulate such a theorem, however.

      = - .

36. Let  be an angle measured in radians and let P (a, b) be a point on the terminal side of 
     when it is drawn in standard position. Use Theorem 10.3 and the sum identity for sine in
     Theorem 10.15 to show that f (x) = a sin(x) + b cos(x) + B (with  > 0) can be rewritten
     as f (x) = a2 + b2 sin(x + ) + B.

In Exercises 44 - 50, graph the function with the help of your calculator and discuss the given
questions with your classmates.

44. f (x) = cos(3x) + sin(x). Is this function periodic? If so, what is the period?

45. f (x) = x sin(x) . What appears to be the horizontal asymptote of the graph?

46. f (x) = x sin(x). Graph y = ±x on the same set of axes and describe the behavior of f .

47. f (x) = sin  1  . What's happening as x  0?
                 x

48. f (x) = x - tan(x). Graph y = x on the same set of axes and describe the behavior of f .

49. f (x) = e-0.1x (cos(2x) + sin(2x)). Graph y = ±e-0.1x on the same set of axes and describe
     the behavior of f .

50. f (x) = e-0.1x (cos(2x) + 2 sin(x)). Graph y = ±e-0.1x on the same set of axes and describe
     the behavior of f .

51. Show that a constant function f is periodic by showing that f (x + 117) = f (x) for all real
     numbers x. Then show that f has no period by showing that you cannot find a smallest
     number p such that f (x + p) = f (x) for all real numbers x. Said another way, show that
     f (x + p) = f (x) for all real numbers x for ALL values of p > 0, so no smallest value exists to
     satisfy the definition of `period'.

10.6 The Inverse Trigonometric Functions

As the title indicates, in this section we concern ourselves with finding inverses of the (circular)
trigonometric functions. Our immediate problem is that, owing to their periodic nature, none of
the six circular functions is one-to-one. To remedy this, we restrict the domains of the circular
functions in the same way we restricted the domain of the quadratic function in Example 5.2.3 in
Section 5.2 to obtain a one-to-one function. We first consider f (x) = cos(x). Choosing the interval
[0, ] allows us to keep the range as [-1, 1] as well as the properties of being smooth and continuous.

                                                                                          y

                                                                                                                                        x

                           Restricting the domain of f (x) = cos(x) to [0, ].

Recall from Section 5.2 that the inverse of a function f is typically denoted f -1. For this reason,

some textbooks use the notation f -1(x) = cos-1(x) for the inverse of f (x) = cos(x). The obvious

pitfall here is our convention of writing (cos(x))2 as cos2(x), (cos(x))3 as cos3(x) and so on. It

is  far  too  easy  to  confuse  cos-1(x)  with     1    =  sec(x)  so  we  will  not                                     use  this  notation  in  our
                                                 cos(x)

text.1 Instead, we use the notation f -1(x) = arccos(x), read `arc-cosine of x'. To understand the

`arc' in `arccosine', recall that an inverse function, by definition, reverses the process of the original

function. The function f (t) = cos(t) takes a real number input t, associates it with the angle

 = t radians, and returns the value cos(). Digging deeper,2 we have that cos() = cos(t) is the

x-coordinate of the terminal point on the Unit Circle of an oriented arc of length |t| whose initial

point is (1, 0). Hence, we may view the inputs to f (t) = cos(t) as oriented arcs and the outputs as

x-coordinates on the Unit Circle. The function f -1, then, would take x-coordinates on the Unit

Circle and return oriented arcs, hence the `arc' in arccosine. Below are the graphs of f (x) = cos(x)

and f -1(x) = arccos(x), where we obtain the latter from the former by reflecting it across the line

y = x, in accordance with Theorem 5.3.

We restrict g(x) = sin(x) in a similar manner, although the interval of choice is - 2 , 2 .

                                                                                          y

It should be no surprise that we call g-1(x) = arcsin(x), which is read `arc-sine of x'.

We list some important facts about the arccosine and arcsine functions in the following theorem.

Everything in Theorem 10.26 is a direct consequence of the facts that f (x) = cos(x) for 0  x  

and  F (x)  =  arccos(x)           are  inverses  of      each  other  as       are  g(x)  =        sin(x)    for  - 2     x         and

G(x) = arcsin(x). It's about time for an example.

Example 10.6.1.

1. Find the exact values of the following.

                                                                          (d) arcsin - 12

     (c) arccos - 22

     (e) arccos       cos                                                    (f) arccos       cos   11

     (g) cos arccos - 35                                                  (h) sin arccos - 35

2. Rewrite the following as algebraic expressions of x and state the domain on which the equiv-
   alence is valid.

     (a) tan (arccos (x))                                                 (b) cos (2 arcsin(x))

1.   (a) To find arccos              1  , we need to find the real number t (or, equivalently, an angle measuring

                                                                                              12 .

            criteria, so arccos         1   = 3 .
                                        2

     (b) The value of arcsin                2     is  a   real  number    t     between             and    2  with  sin(t)  =

                                                                       
            number we seek is t = 4 . Hence, arcsin 22 = 4 .

     (c) The number t = arccos                                                                                                    

                                                - 22      lies in the interval [0, ] with cos(t) = - 22 . Our answer

          is arccos - 22 = 34 .

     (d) To find arcsin - 12 , we seek the number t in the interval - 2 , 2 with sin(t) = - 12 . The
            answer is t = - 6 so that arcsin - 12                         
                                                                =      -  6  .

     (e)    Since  0                 ,  we  could     simply    invoke    Theorem          10.26    to     get  arccos  cos          = 6 .
                           6                                                                                                   6

            However, in order to make sure we understand why this is the case, we choose to work

            the example through usingthe definition of arccosine. Working from the inside out,
                                                       3                              3
            arccos    cos       6       = arccos      2   . Now, arccos              2    is the real number t with 0  t  

                                   
                                   32 . We find t = 6 , so that arccos                              = 6 .

           the previous problem, we know arccos                     2                                   cos        6

     (g) One way to simplify cos arccos - 35 is to use Theorem 10.26 directly. Since - 35 is
          between -1 and 1, we have that cos arccos - 35 = - 35 and we are done. However, as
          before, to really understand why this cancellation occurs, we let t = arccos - 35 . Then,
          by definition, cos(t) = - 35 . Hence, cos arccos - 35 = cos(t) = - 35 , and we are finished
          in (nearly) the same amount of time.

     (h) As in the previous example, we let t = arccos - 35 so that cos(t) = - 35 for some t where
                                                                                                                          
           0     t    .   Since      cos(t)  <  0,  we  can  narrow     this  down      a  bit  and  conclude     that    2         <  t  <  ,

           so that t corresponds to an angle in Quadrant II. In terms of t, then, we need to find

           sin arccos - 35 = sin(t). Using the Pythagorean Identity cos2(t) + sin2(t) = 1, we get
            - 35 2 + sin2(t) = 1 or sin(t) = ± 45 . Since t corresponds to a Quadrants II angle, we
           choose sin(t) = 45 . Hence, sin arccos - 35 = 45 .

2. (a) We begin this problem in the same manner we began the previous two problems. To

           help us see the forest for the trees, we let t = arccos(x), so our goal is to find a way to

           express tan (arccos (x)) = tan(t) in terms of x. Since t = arccos(x), we know cos(t) = x

           where 0  t  , but since we are after an expression for tan(t), we know we need to

           throw out t =             from consideration.            Hence, either 0  t <                or        < t   so that,
                                  2                                                                  2         2
           geometrically, t corresponds to an angle in Quadrant I or Quadrant II. One approach3

           to finding tan(t) is to use the quotient identity tan(t) = cos(t) sin(t) . Substituting cos(t) = x

           into the Pythagorean Identity cos2(t) + sin2(t) = 1 gives x2 + sin2(t) = 1, from which we
           get sin(t) = ± 1 - x2. Since t corresponds to angles in Quadrants I and II, sin(t)  0,
           so we choose sin(t) = 1 - x2. Thus,

                                                                                
                                                    tan(t) = sin(t) = 1 - x2
                                                                    cos(t)           x

           To determine the values of x for which this equivalence is valid, we consider our sub-

           stitution t = arccos(x). Since the domain of arccos(x) is [-1, 1], we know we must

           restrict -1  x  1. Additionally, since we had to discard t = 2 , we need to discard
                                                                        
                                                                          1-x2
           x = cos 2 = 0. Hence, tan (arccos (x)) = x is valid for x in [-1, 0)  (0, 1].

     (b) We proceed as in the previous problem by writing t = arcsin(x) so that t lies in the

           interval - 2 , 2 with sin(t) = x. We aim to express cos (2 arcsin(x)) = cos(2t) in terms
           of x. Since cos(2t) is defined everywhere, we get no additional restrictions on t as we did

           in the previous problem. We have three choices for rewriting cos(2t): cos2(t) - sin2(t),

           2 cos2(t) - 1 and 1 - 2 sin2(t). Since we know x = sin(t), it is easiest to use the last form:

                                     cos (2 arcsin(x)) = cos(2t) = 1 - 2 sin2(t) = 1 - 2x2

3Alternatively,  we   could  use  the  identity:    1 + tan2(t)  =  sec2(t).  Since  x  =  cos(t),  sec(t)  =     1    =  x1 .  The    reader
                                                                                                               cos(t)

is invited to work through this approach to see what, if any, difficulties arise.

               To find the restrictions on x, we once again appeal to our substitution t = arcsin(x).
               Since arcsin(x) is defined only for -1  x  1, the equivalence cos (2 arcsin(x)) = 1-2x2

               is valid only on [-1, 1].

A few remarks about Example 10.6.1 are in order. Most of the common errors encountered in

dealing with the inverse circular functions come from the need to restrict the domains of the

original functions so that they are one-to-one. One instance of this phenomenon is the fact that

arccos    cos  11           =     as  opposed        to  6 11 .  This  is  the  exact  same   phenomenon    discussed    in  Section
                6              6

5.2 when we saw (-2)2 = 2 as opposed to -2. Additionally, even though the expression we

arrived at in part 2b above, namely 1 - 2x2, is defined for all real numbers, the equivalence

cos (2 arcsin(x)) = 1 - 2x2 is valid for only -1  x  1. This is akin to the fact that while the
                                                                                2

expression x is defined for all real numbers, the equivalence ( x) = x is valid only for x  0. For

this reason, it pays to be careful when we determine the intervals where such equivalences are valid.

The next pair of functions we wish to discuss are the inverses of tangent and cotangent, which

are named arctangent and arccotangent, respectively. First, we restrict f (x) = tan(x) to its

fundamental cycle on - 2 , 2 to obtain f -1(x) = arctan(x). Among other things, note that the
                                        - 2

Next, we restrict g(x) = cot(x) to its fundamental cycle on (0, ) to obtain g-1(x) = arccot(x).
Once again, the vertical asymptotes x = 0 and x =  of the graph of g(x) = cot(x) become the
horizontal asymptotes y = 0 and y =  of the graph of g-1(x) = arccot(x). We show these graphs
on the next page and list some of the basic properties of the arctangent and arccotangent functions.

                                                                 (d) sin arctan - 34

         (c) cot(arccot(-5))

2. Rewrite the following as algebraic expressions of x and state the domain on which the equiv-
   alence is valid.

    (a) tan(2 arctan(x))                                         (b) cos(arccot(2x))

Solution.

1. (a) We know arctan(3) is the real number t between -    2 and 2 with tan(t) = 3. We find
          t = 3 , so arctan( 3) = 3 .  

    (b) The real number t = arccot(- 3) lies in the interval (0, ) with cot(t) = - 3. We get
          arccot(- 3) = 56 .

    (c) We can apply Theorem 10.27 directly and obtain cot(arccot(-5)) = -5. However,

           working it through provides us with yet another opportunity to understand why this

           is the case. Letting t = arccot(-5), we have that t belongs to the interval (0, ) and

           cot(t) = -5. Hence, cot(arccot(-5)) = cot(t) = -5.

    (d) We start simplifying sin arctan - 34 by letting t = arctan - 34 . Then tan(t) = - 34 for
         some - 2 < t < 2 . Since tan(t) < 0, we know, in fact, - 2 < t < 0. One way to proceed
         is to use The Pythagorean Identity, 1+cot2(t) = csc2(t), since this relates the reciprocals

           of tan(t) and sin(t) and is valid for all t under consideration.4 From tan(t) = - 34 , we
           get cot(t) = - 43 . Substituting, we get 1 + - 43 2 = csc2(t) so that csc(t) = ± 53 . Since
           - 2 < t < 0, we choose csc(t) = - 53 , so sin(t) = - 35 . Hence, sin arctan - 34                         3
                                                                                                             =   -  5  .

2.  (a)    If  we  let  t = arctan(x),     then  - 2  <t<        and  tan(t) = x.  We    look  for  a  way   to  express
                                                              2

           tan(2 arctan(x)) = tan(2t) in terms of x. Before we get started using identities, we note

           that    tan(2t)  is  undefined  when      2t =     + k  for  integers   k.  Dividing   both  sides    of    this
                                                           2
                                                                                                       2 k,
           equation     by  2   tells  us  we  need   to  exclude  values  of  t  where  t  =  4  +          where     k  is

           an integer. The only members of this family which lie in - 2 , 2 are t = ± 4 , which
           means the values of t under consideration are - 2 , - 4  - 4 , 4  4 , 2 . Returning

           to arctan(2t), we note the double angle identity tan(2t) = 1-tan2(t) 2 tan(t) , is valid for all the

           values of t under consideration, hence we get

                                tan(2 arctan(x)) = tan(2t) = 1 - tan2 2 tan(t)(t) = 1 - x2 2x

    4It's always a good idea to make sure the identities used in these situations are valid for all values t under
consideration. Check our work back in Example 10.6.1. Were the identities we used there valid for all t under
consideration? A pedantic point, to be sure, but what else do you expect from this book?

     To find where this equivalence is valid we check back with our substitution t = arctan(x).

     Since the domain of arctan(x) is all real numbers, the only exclusions come from the

     values of t we discarded earlier, t = ± 4 . Since x = tan(t), this means we exclude
     x = tan ± 4                                                                    2x
                   = ±1.   Hence,     the  equivalence   tan(2 arctan(x)) =       1-x2  holds  for  all  x  in

     (-, -1)  (-1, 1)  (1, ).

     (b) To get started, we let t = arccot(2x) so that cot(t) = 2x where 0 < t < . In terms

     of t, cos(arccot(2x)) = cos(t), and our goal is to express the latter in terms of x. Since

     cos(t) is always defined, there are no additional restrictions on t, so we can begin using

     identities to relate cot(t) to cos(t). The identity cot(t) = sin(t) cos(t) is valid for t in (0, ),

     so our strategy is to obtain sin(t) in terms of x, then write cos(t) = cot(t) sin(t). The

     identity 1 + cot2(t) = csc2(t) holds for all t in (0, ) and relates cot(t) and csc(t) = sin(t) 1 .
                                                                                    
     Substituting  cot(t)  = 2x,  we  get  1 + (2x)2  =  csc2(t),  or  csc(t)  =  ± 4x2 + 1.   Since     t  is

     between 0 and , csc(t) > 0, so csc(t) = 4x2 + 1 which gives sin(t) =  1 4x2+1 . Hence,

                   cos(arccot(2x)) = cos(t) = cot(t) sin(t) =  2x
                                                                            4x2 + 1

     Since arccot(2x) is defined for all real numbers x and we encountered no additional
     restrictions on t, we have cos (arccot(2x)) =  2x 4x2+1 for all real numbers x.

The last two functions to invert are secant and cosecant. A portion of each of their graphs, which
were first discussed in Subsection 10.5.2, are given below with the fundamental cycles highlighted.

     y                                                                            y

                                           x                                                                x

     The graph of y = sec(x).                                      The graph of y = csc(x).

It is clear from the graph of secant that we cannot find one single continuous piece of its graph
which covers its entire range of (-, -1]  [1, ) and restricts the domain of the function so that it
is one-to-one. The same is true for cosecant. Thus in order to define the arcsecant and arccosecant
functions, we must settle for a piecewise approach wherein we choose one piece to cover the top
of the range, namely [1, ), and another piece to cover the bottom, namely (-, -1]. There are
two generally accepted ways make these choices which restrict the domains of these functions so
that they are one-to-one. One approach simplifies the Trigonometry associated with the inverse
functions, but complicates the Calculus; the other makes the Calculus easier, but the Trigonometry
less so. We present both points of view.

10.6.1 Inverses of Secant and Cosecant: Trigonometry Friendly Approach

In this subsection, we restrict the secant and cosecant functions to coincide with the restrictions
on cosine and sine, respectively. For f (x) = sec(x), we restrict the domain to 0, 2  2 ,

                                  switch x and y coordinates

Note that for both arcsecant and arccosecant, the domain is (-, -1]  [1, ). Taking a page
from Section 2.2, we can rewrite this as {x : |x|  1}. This is often done in Calculus textbooks, so
we include it here for completeness. Using these definitions, we get the following properties of the
arcsecant and arccosecant functions.

Solution.

1.  (a) Using Theorem 10.28, we have arcsec(2) = arccos                          1  = 3 .
                                                                                 2

    (b) Once again, Theorem 10.28 comes to our aid giving arccsc(-2) = arcsin - 12                                        =  -     .
                                                                                                                                6

    (c)    Since    5    doesn't    fall   between  0  and      or     and   ,      we  cannot   use  the        inverse  property
                    4                                        2      2

           stated in Theorem 10.28. We can, nevertheless, begin by working `inside out' which
                                    5          = arcsec(-2) = arccos - 22 = 43 .
           yields arcsec       sec  4

    (d) One way to begin to simplify cot (arccsc (-3)) is to let t = arccsc(-3). Then, csc(t) = -3

           and, since this is negative, we have that t lies in the interval                          -     ,  0  .  We are after
                                                                                                        2
           cot (arccsc (-3)) = cot(t), so we use the Pythagorean Identity 1 + cot2(t) = csc2(t).
           Substituting, we have 1 + cot2(t) = (-3)2, or cot(t) = ± 8 = ±2 2. Since - 2  t < 0,
                                                                       
           cot(t) < 0, so we get cot (arccsc (-3)) = -2 2.

2. (a) We begin simplifying tan(arcsec(x)) by letting t = arcsec(x). Then, sec(t) = x for t in

           0, 2  2 ,  , and we seek a formula for tan(t). Since tan(t) is defined for all t values
          under consideration, we have no additional restrictions on t. To relate sec(t) to tan(t), we

          use the identity 1 + tan2(t) = sec2(t). This is valid for all values of t under consideration,
          and when we substitute sec(t) = x, we get 1 + tan2(t) = x2. Hence, tan(t) = ± x2 - 1.

          If t belongs to 0, 2 then tan(t)  0; if, on the the other hand, t belongs to 2 ,  then
          tan(t)  0. As a result, we get a piecewise defined function for tan(t)

                                               tan(t) =                      if  0      t  <  
                                                                 x2 - 1,                      2

                                                                             if     <   t     
                                                             - x2 - 1,           2

           Now we need to determine what these conditions on t mean for x. Since x = sec(t),

           when     0    t  <  2 ,  x      1,  and  when     <  t     ,   x    -1.      Since    we  encountered    no       further
                                                          2

           restrictions on t, the equivalence below holds for all x in (-, -1]  [1, ).

                                           tan(arcsec(x)) =                               if x  1
                                                                        x2 - 1,         if x  -1

                                                                      
                                                                    - x2 - 1,

    (b) To simplify cos(arccsc(4x)), we start by letting t = arccsc(4x). Then csc(t) = 4x for t in

           -     ,  0    0, 2  , and we now set about finding an expression for cos(arccsc(4x)) = cos(t).
              2

           Since cos(t) is defined for all t, we do not encounter any additional restrictions on t.

           From csc(t) = 4x, we get sin(t) = 14x , so to find cos(t), we can make use if the identity
                                                                                                     2 = 1. Solving, we get
           cos2(t) + sin2(t)   =       1.  Substituting   sin(t)   =  1   gives  cos2(t) +       1
                                                                      4x                         4x

                                                                                 
                                                             16x2 - 1 = ± 16x2 - 1
                                               cos(t) = ±       16x2                    4|x|

                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                            16-x2
           Since t belongs to - 2 , 0  0, 2 , we know cos(t)  0, so we choose cos(t) = 4|x| .

           (The absolute values here are necessary, since x could be negative.) To find the values for
830                                                               Foundations of Trigonometry

        which this equivalence is valid, we look back at our original substution, t = arccsc(4x).

        Since the domain of arccsc(x) requires its argument x to satisfy |x|  1, the domain of

Solution.

1.   (a) Since 2  1, we may invoke Theorem 10.29 to get arcsec(2) = arccos                         1  = 3 .
                                                                                                   2

     (b) Unfortunately, -2 is not greater to or equal to 1, so we cannot apply Theorem 10.29 to

          arccsc(-2) and convert this into an arcsine problem. Instead, we appeal to the definition.
          The real number t = arccsc(-2) lies in 0, 2  , 32 and satisfies csc(t) = -2. The t
          we're after is t = 76 , so arccsc(-2) = 76 .

     (c)   Since   5  lies  between    and  32 ,   we  may       apply   Theorem         10.29  directly  to  simplify
                   4
                        5     = 54 . We encourage the reader to work this through using the defini-
           arcsec  sec  4

           tion as we have done in the previous examples to see how it goes.

     (d) To simplify cot (arccsc (-3)) we let t = arccsc (-3) so that cot (arccsc (-3)) = cot(t).

           We know csc(t) = -3, and since this is negative, t lies in , 32 . Using the identity
                                                                                                          
           1 + cot2(t) = csc2(t), we find 1 + cot2(t) = (-3)2 so that cot(t) = ± 8 = ±2 2. Since
           t is in the interval , 32 , we know cot(t) > 0. Our answer is cot (arccsc (-3)) = 2 2.

2. (a) We begin simplifying tan(arcsec(x)) by letting t = arcsec(x). Then, sec(t) = x for t in
           0, 2  , 32 , and we seek a formula for tan(t). Since tan(t) is defined for all t values
          under consideration, we have no additional restrictions on t. To relate sec(t) to tan(t), we
          use the identity 1 + tan2(t) = sec2(t). This is valid for all values of t under consideration,
          and when we substitute sec(t) = x, we get 1 + tan2(t) = x2. Hence, tan(t) = ± x2 - 1.
          Since t lies in 0, 2  , 32 , tan(t)  0, so we choose tan(t) = x2 - 1. Since we found
                                                                                               
          no additional restrictions on t, the equivalence tan(arcsec(x)) = x2 - 1 holds for all x

          in the domain of t = arcsec(x), namely (-, -1]  [1, ).

     (b) To simplify cos(arccsc(4x)), we start by letting t = arccsc(4x). Then csc(t) = 4x for t in

           0, 2  , 32 , and we now set about finding an expression for cos(arccsc(4x)) = cos(t).

           Since cos(t) is defined for all t, we do not encounter any additional restrictions on t.

           From csc(t) = 4x, we get sin(t) = 14x , so to find cos(t), we can make use if the identity
                                                                                               2 = 1. Solving, we get
           cos2(t) + sin2(t)  =  1.  Substituting  sin(t)  =  1   gives     cos2(t) +    1
                                                              4x                         4x

                                                                            
                                                       16x2 - 1 = ± 16x2 - 1
                                       cos(t) = ±      16x2                     4|x|

                                                                                       16x2-1

           If t lies in 0, 2 , then cos(t)  0, and we choose cos(t) = 4|x| . Otherwise, t belongs
                                                                                         
                   3                                                                       16x2-1
           to , 2 in which case cos(t)  0, so, we choose cos(t) = - 4|x| This leads us to a

           (momentarily) piecewise defined function for cos(t)

                                            
                                             16x2 - 1
                                             4|x| ,                      if  0      t    
                                                                                         2
                                     cos(t) =  16x2 - 1
                                            -                     ,     if    <  t     3

           We now see what these restrictions mean in terms of x. Since 4x = csc(t), we get that
           for 0  t  2 , 4x  1, or x  14 . In this case, we can simplify |x| = x so

                                                               
                                        cos(t) = 16x2 - 1 = 16x2 - 1

           Similarly, for  < t  32 , we get 4x  -1, or x  - 14 . In this case, |x| = -x, so we also

           get                                                          

                   cos(t) = - 16x2 - 1 = - 16x2 - 1 = 16x2 - 1

           Hence, in all cases, cos(arccsc(4x)) = 4x , and this equivalence is valid for all x in

10.6.3 Calculators and the Inverse Circular Functions.

In the sections to come, we will have need to approximate the values of the inverse circular functions.
On most calculators, only the arcsine, arccosine and arctangent functions are available and they
are usually labeled as sin-1, cos-1 and tan-1, respectively. If we are asked to approximate these
values, it is a simple matter to punch up the appropriate decimal on the calculator. If we are asked
for an arccotangent, arcsecant or arccosecant, however, we often need to employ some ingenuity, as
our next example illustrates.

Example 10.6.5.

1. Use a calculator to approximate the following values to four decimal places.

(a) arccot(2)                  (b) arcsec(5)            (c) arccot(-2)        (d) arccsc - 3
                                                                                                2

2. Find the domain and range of the following functions. Check your answers using a calculator.

(a) f (x) =  - arccos x                 (b) f (x) = 3 arctan (4x).      (c) f (x) = arccot x + 
                2              5                                                                  2

Solution.

1. (a) Since 2 > 0, we can use the property listed in Theorem 10.27 to rewrite arccot(2) as

           arccot(2) = arctan  1  .  In `radian' mode, we find arccot(2) = arctan  1   0.4636.
                               2                                                   2

(b) Since 5  1, we can use the property from either Theorem 10.28 or Theorem 10.29 to

     (c) Since the argument -2 is negative, we cannot directly apply Theorem 10.27 to help us

     find arccot(-2). Let t = arccot(-2). Then t is a real number such that 0 < t < 

     and  cot(t) = -2.  Moreover,  since  cot(t) < 0,  we  know     < t < .     Geometrically,  this
                                                                 2

     means t corresponds to a Quadrant II angle  = t radians. This allows us to proceed

     using a `reference angle' approach. Consider , the reference angle for , as pictured

     below. By definition,  is an acute angle so 0 <  < 2 , and the Reference Angle
     Theorem, Theorem 10.2, tells us that cot() = 2. This means  = arccot(2) radians.

     Since the argument of arccotangent is now a positive 2, we can use Theorem 10.27 to get

      = arccot(2) = arctan  1  radians. Since  =  -  =  - arctan             1   2.6779 radians,
                            2                                                2

     we get arccot(-2)  2.6779.

     Another way to attack the problem is to use arctan - 12 . By definition, the real number
     t = arctan - 12 satisfies tan(t) = - 12 with - 2 < t < 2 . Since tan(t) < 0, we know
     more specifically that - 2 < t < 0, so t corresponds to an angle  in Quadrant IV. To
     find the value of arccot(-2), we once again visualize the angle  = arccot(-2) radians

     and note that it is a Quadrant II angle with tan() = - 12 . This means it is exactly 
     units away from , and we get  =  +  =  + arctan - 12  2.6779 radians. Hence,
     as before, arccot(-2)  2.6779.

get arccsc - 32 = arcsin - 23  -0.7297. If, on the other hand, the range of arccosecant

t = arccsc - 32 . Then t is a real number with csc(t) = - 32 . Since csc(t) < 0, we have
that  <   32 , so t corresponds to a Quadrant III angle, . As above, we let  be
                                                                         32 ,                             3

2. (a) Since the domain of F (x) = arccos(x) is -1  x  1, we can find the domain of

     f (x)  =     -  arccos        x  by setting the argument of the arccosine, in this case x5 , between
               2                   5
                                        x
     -1  and   1.  Solving     -1       5        1  gives   -5      x       5,  so  the  domain      is  [-5, 5].  To   determine

     the range of f , we take a cue from Section 1.7. Three `key' points on the graph of

     F (x) = arccos(x) are (-1, ), 0, 2 and (1, 0) . Following the procedure outlined in
                                                                                               5, 2
     Theorem 1.7, we track these points to                      -5,  -   2   , (0, 0) and            . Plotting these values

     tells us that the range5 of f is - 2 , 2 . Our graph confirms our results.

     (b) To find the domain and range of f (x) = 3 arctan (4x), we note that since the domain

     of F (x) = arctan(x) is all real numbers, the only restrictions, if any, on the domain of

     f (x) = 3 arctan (4x) come from the argument of the arctangent, in this case, 4x. Since

     4x is defined for all real numbers, we have established that the domain of f is all real

     numbers. To determine the range of f , we can, once again, appeal to Theorem 1.7.

     Choosing our `key' point to be (0, 0) and tracking the horizontal asymptotes y = - 2
     and y = 2 , we find that the graph of y = f (x) = 3 arctan (4x) differs from the graph of
     y = F (x) = arctan(x) by a horizontal compression by a factor of 4 and a vertical stretch

     by a factor of 3. It is the latter which affects the range, producing a range of - 32 , 32 .
     We confirm our findings on the calculator below.

     y = f (x) =  - arccos x                                                    y = f (x) = 3 arctan (4x)

     (c) To find the domain of g(x) = arccot                x     + , we proceed as above. Since the domain of
                                                            2
                                                         x
     G(x)   =  arccot(x)       is  (-, ),           and  2  is  defined      for  all  x,  we  get   that   the  domain      of  g  is

     (-, ) as well. As for the range, we note that the range of G(x) = arccot(x), like that

     of F (x) = arctan(x), is limited by a pair of horizontal asymptotes, in this case y = 0

     and y = . Following Theorem 1.7, we graph y = g(x) = arccot                                         x      +  starting with
                                                                                                         2

     y = G(x) = arccot(x) and first performing a horizontal expansion by a factor of 2 and

     following that with a vertical shift upwards by . This latter transformation is the one

     which affects the range, making it now (, 2). To check this graphically, we encounter

     a bit of a problem, since on many calculators, there is no shortcut button corresponding

     to the arccotangent function. Taking a cue from number 1c, we attempt to rewrite

     g(x) = arccot      x      + in terms of the arctangent function. Using Theorem 10.27, we have
                        2
                     x                     2             x
     that arccot     2  = arctan           x     when    2  >   0,  or,  in  this   case,  when  x   >      0.  Hence,  for  x   >  0,

     we have g(x) = arctan            2    + .      When       x  <  0,  we     can  use   the  same     argument      in  number

Hence, for x < 0, g(x) =  + arctan  2     +  = arctan       2  + 2. What about x = 0? We
                                    x                       x

know g(0) = arccot(0) +  = , and neither of the formulas for g involving arctangent

will produce this result.6 Hence, in order to graph y = g(x) on our calculators, we need

to write it as a piecewise defined function:

                                           arctan x + 2, if x < 0

                                                         x

We show the input and the result below.

y = g(x) in terms of arctangent               y = g(x) = arccot     x          +

The inverse trigonometric functions are typically found in applications whenever the measure of an
angle is required. One such scenario is presented in the following example.

Example 10.6.6. 7 The roof on the house below has a `6/12 pitch'. This means that when viewed
from the side, the roof line has a rise of 6 feet over a run of 12 feet. Find the angle of inclination
from the bottom of the roof to the top of the roof. Express your answer in decimal degrees, rounded
to the nearest hundredth of a degree.

the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 6 feet and 12 feet. Using Theorem 10.10, we

10.6.4 Solving Equations Using the Inverse Trigonometric Functions.

In  Sections   10.2     and   10.3,       we  learned    how   to   solve   equations   like   sin()     =  1    for  angles      and
                                                                                                            2

tan(t) = -1 for real numbers t. In each case, we ultimately appealed to the Unit Circle and relied

on the fact that the answers corresponded to a set of `common angles' listed on page 724. If, on

the   other  hand,      we    had    been     asked  to  find  all  angles  with   sin()    =   1    or  solve   tan(t)  =    -2  for
                                                                                                3

real numbers t, we would have been hard-pressed to do so. With the introduction of the inverse

trigonometric functions, however, we are now in a position to solve these equations. A good parallel

to keep in mind is how the square root function can be used to solve certain quadratic equations.

The     equation    x2  =  4  is  a  lot  like  sin()  =  1  in  that  it  has  friendly,  `common       value'  answers  x   =   ±2.
                                                          2
The equation x2 = 7, on the other hand, is a lot like sin() = 13 . We know8 there are answers, but
we can't express them using `friendly' numbers.9 To solve x2 = 7, we make use of the square root
function and write x = ± 7. We can certainly approximate these answers using a calculator, but
as far as exact answers go, we leave them as x = ± 7. In the same way, we will use the arcsine

function to solve sin() = 13 , as seen in the following example.

Example 10.6.7. Solve the following equations.

    1. Find all angles  for which sin() = 13 .

    2. Find all real numbers t for which tan(t) = -2

    3.  Solve  sec(x)      =  -   5  for x.
                                  3

Solution.

    1. If sin() = 13 , then the terminal side of , when plotted in standard position, intersects the
       Unit Circle at y = 13 . Geometrically, we see that this happens at two places: in Quadrant I
       and Quadrant II. If we let  denote the acute solution to the equation, then all the solutions

    8How do we know this again?                                                               

    9This is all, of course, a matter of opinion. For the record, the authors find ± 7 just as `nice' as ±2.

functions to express our answers.             The real number t = arcsin        3  is defined so it satisfies

0  <  t  <     with  sin(t)  =  13 .  Hence,    =  arcsin   1  radians. Since the solutions in Quadrant I

are all coterminal with , we get part of our solution to be  =  + 2k = arcsin                      3    + 2k

for integers k. Turning our attention to Quadrant II, we get one solution to be  - . Hence,

the Quadrant II solutions are  =  -  + 2k =  - arcsin                1    + 2k, for integers k.
                                                                     3

2. We may visualize the solutions to tan(t) = -2 as angles  with tan() = -2. Since tangent

is negative only in Quadrants II and IV, we focus our efforts there.

                           y                                                       y

                           1                                                       1

                                            1                                                      1

                                                         x                                              x
                                   = arctan(-2) radians
                                                                                                 

Since -2 isn't the tangent of any of the `common angles', we need to use the arctangent

function to express our answers. The real number t = arctan(-2) satisfies tan(t) = -2 and
- 2 < t < 0. If we let  = arctan(-2) radians, we see that all of the Quadrant IV solutions
840                                                                       Foundations of Trigonometry

     to tan() = -2 are coterminal with . Moreover, the solutions from Quadrant II differ by
     exactly  units from the solutions in Quadrant IV, so all the solutions to tan() = -2 are of
     the form  =  + k = arctan(-2) + k for some integer k. Switching back to the variable t,
     we record our final answer to tan(t) = -2 as t = arctan(-2) + k for integers k.

3.   The  last  equation  we  are  asked  to  solve,  sec(x)  =  -  5  ,  poses  two  immediate  problems.  First,
                                                                    3

     we are not told whether or not x represents an angle or a real number. We assume the latter,

     but note that we will use angles and the Unit Circle to solve the equation regardless. Second,

     as we have mentioned, there is no universally accepted range of the arcsecant function. For

     that reason, we adopt the advice given in Section 10.3 and convert this to the cosine problem

     cos(x) = - 35 . Adopting an angle approach, we consider the equation cos() = - 35 and note
     that our solutions lie in Quadrants II and III. Since - 35 isn't the cosine of any of the `common
     angles', we'll need to express our solutions in terms of the arccosine function. The real number

     t = arccos - 35  is defined so that         < t <  with cos(t) = - 35 .          If we let  = arccos   - 35
                                              2

     radians, we see that  is a Quadrant II angle. To obtain a Quadrant III angle solution,

     we may simply use - = - arccos - 35 . Since all angle solutions are coterminal with 
     or -, we get our solutions to cos() = - 35 to be  =  + 2k = arccos - 35 + 2k or
      = - + 2k = - arccos - 35 + 2k for integers k. Switching back to the variable x, we
     record our final answer to sec(x) = - 53 as x = arccos - 35 + 2k or x = - arccos - 35 + 2k
     for integers k.

                              y                                                       y

                              1                                                       1
                                       = arccos - 35 radians                                   = arccos - 35 radians
                                                 1x
                                                                                                         1x

The reader is encouraged to check the answers found in Example 10.6.7 - both analytically and
with the calculator (see Section 10.6.3). With practice, the inverse trigonometric functions will
become as familiar to you as the square root function. Speaking of practice . . .

     (a) Clearly AOB and BCD are right triangles because the line through O and A and
          the line through C and D are perpendicular to the x-axis. Use the distance formula to
          show that BAD is also a right triangle (with BAD being the right angle) by showing
          that the sides of the triangle satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.

     (b) Use AOB to show that  = arctan(1)

     (c) Use BAD to show that  = arctan(2)

     (d) Use BCD to show that  = arctan(3)

     (e) Use the fact that O, B and C all lie on the x-axis to conclude that  +  +  = . Thus
          arctan(1) + arctan(2) + arctan(3) = .

  10The equivalence for x = ±1 can be verified independently of the derivation of the formula, but Calculus is required
to fully understand what is happening at those x values. You'll see what we mean when you work through the details
of the identity for tan(2t). For now, we exclude x = ±1 from our answer.

10.7 Trigonometric Equations and Inequalities

In Sections 10.2, 10.3 and most recently 10.6, we solved some basic equations involving the trigono-
metric functions. Below we summarize the techniques we've employed thus far. Note that we use
the neutral letter `u' as the argument1 of each circular function for generality.

        Strategies for Solving Basic Equations Involving Trigonometric Functions

         To solve cos(u) = c or sin(u) = c for -1  c  1, first solve for u in the interval [0, 2) and
           add integer multiples of the period 2. If c < -1 or of c > 1, there are no real solutions.

         To solve sec(u) = c or csc(u) = c for c  -1 or c  1, convert to cosine or sine, respectively,
           and solve as above. If -1 < c < 1, there are no real solutions.

         To solve tan(u) = c for any real number c, first solve for u in the interval - 2 , 2 and add
           integer multiples of the period .

         To solve cot(u) = c for c = 0, convert to tangent and solve as above. If c = 0, the solution

           to   cot(u)   =  0   is  u  =      +   k    for     integers   k.
                                          2

Using   the     above    guidelines,      we      can  comfortably        solve    sin(x)  =  1    and  find    the  solution    x  =      + 2k
                                                                                              2                                         6
            5                                                                                                      12 ?
or  x   =   6   + 2k     for    integers      k.  How      do   we  solve     something      like  sin(3x)      =        Since  this  equation

has    the  form   sin(u)       =   12 ,  we  know     the     solutions      take  the  form    u   =      + 2k     or   u  =   5  + 2k      for
                                                                                                        6                        6
                                                                                                                                5
integers k.        Since the argument of sine here is 3x, we have 3x =                               6  +   2k     or    3x  =  6   +   2k    for

integers    k.  To  solve      for  x,    we  divide       both     sides2  of  these  equations     by     3,  and  obtain     x  =       +  23 k
                                                                                                                                      18
            5      23 k
or  x   =   18  +        for   integers       k.  This     is  the  technique       employed     in  the   example       below.

Solution.

                                                       
                                                            3               5                        7
    1.  The     solutions      to   cos(u)    =   -        2   are  u  =    6   +   2k   or  u   =   6    +  2k      for  integers    k.   Since

        the     argument      of    cosine    here     is  2x,  this   means    2x  =    5   + 2k       or  2x  =    7    + 2k     for  integers
                                                                                         6                           6
        k. Solving for x gives x = 5 12 + k or x = 7 12 + k for integers k. To check these answers

        analytically, we substitute them into the original equation. For any integer k we have

                            cos 2 5 12 + k                 = cos 56 + 2k

                                                                                         (the period of cosine is 2)
                                                                     6

                                                           = - 32

     Similarly, we find cos 2 7 12 + k                                                                               

                                                    = cos 76 + 2k = cos 76 = - 32 . To determine

     which of our solutions lie in [0, 2), we substitute integer values for k. The solutions we

     keep come from the values of k = 0 and k = 1 and are x =                          12 5 ,  12 7 ,  17  and  12 19 .  Using a
                                                                                                       12

     calculator,   we     graph   y  =  cos(2x)  and     y  =   -   3  over    [0, 2)  and     examine     where     these        two
                                                                   2

     graphs intersect. We see that the x-coordinates of the intersection points correspond to the

     decimal representations of our exact answers.

                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                  2
2. Since this equation has the form csc(u) =                        2, we rewrite this as sin(u) =               2       and    find

     u  =     + 2k    or  u  =    3  + 2k  for  integers    k.  Since  the  argument   of      cosecant    here  is      1  x  -    ,
           4                      4                                                                                      3

                                     1 x -  =  + 2k or 1 x -  = 3 + 2k

     To  solve  1  x  -    =      + 2k,  we  first  add       to  both    sides

                                                      1 x =  + 2k +

     A common error is to treat the `2k' and `' terms as `like' terms and try to combine them
     when they are not.3 We can, however, combine the `' and ` 4 ' terms to get

                                                        1 x = 5 + 2k
                                                        34
     We now finish by multiplying both sides by 3 to get

                                           x = 3 5 + 2k = 15 + 6k
                                                    4                       4

     Solving the other equation, 13 x -  = 34 + 2k produces x = 21 4 + 6k for integers k. To
     check the first family of answers, we substitute, combine line terms, and simplify.

              csc 1 15 3 4 + 6k -            =      csc  5    +   2k   -  
                                                         4

                                             =      csc     +   2k
                                                         4

                                             =      csc                          (the period of cosecant is 2)
                                                         4

                                             =2

     The   family  x  =    21   + 6k    checks  similarly.      Despite   having   infinitely  many        solutions,       we  find
                            4

     that none of them lie in [0, 2). To verify this graphically, we use areciprocal identity to
     rewrite the cosecant as a sine and we find that y =                        1      and y = 2 do not intersect at

                                                                               1
                                                                          sin( 3 x-)

     all over the interval [0, 2).

3.  Since cot(3x) = 0 has the form cot(u) = 0,                      we know u =              +  k,     so,   in this case,   3x =        +  k
                                                                                          2                                           2

    for  integers     k.  Solving  for   x      yields  x  =    6   +        Checking        our  answers,       we    get

                      cot 3 6 + 3 k               =     cot         +  k
                                                                2

                                                  =     cot                     (the period of cotangent is )
                                                                2

                                                  =0

    As k runs through the integers, we obtain six answers, corresponding to k = 0 through k = 5,

    which   lie   in  [0, 2):  x   =    6 ,  2 ,  56 ,  7   ,   3   and      6 11 .  To   confirm  these        graphically,  we    must    be
                                                        6       2
    careful. On many calculators, there is no function button for cotangent. We choose4 to use

    the quotient identity cot(3x) = sin(3x) cos(3x) . Graphing y = sin(3x) cos(3x) and y = 0 (the x-axis), we see
    that the x-coordinates of the intersection points approximately match our solutions.

4. The complication in solving an equation like sec2(x) = 4 comes not from the argument of

    secant, which is just x, but rather, the fact the secant is being squared. To get this equation

    to look like one of the forms listed on page 857, we extract square roots to get sec(x) = ±2.

    Converting to cosines, we have cos(x) = ± 12 .                              For  cos(x)     =      12 ,  we  get   x  =      + 2k       or
                                                                                                                              3
         5                                        For cos(x) = - 12 , we get x =                  2                          4
    x=   3    +   2k      for  integers      k.                                                   3    +     2k    or  x  =  3   +  2k      for

    integers k. If we take a step back and think of these families of solutions geometrically, we

    see we are finding the measures of all angles with a reference angle of 3 . As a result, these
                                                                                                                                    2
    solutions     can     be  combined       and    we  may     write     our   solutions     as   x   =     3  +  k   and   x  =   3    +  k

    for integers k. To check the first family of solutions, we note that, depending on the integer

    k, sec        +   k       doesn't always equal sec                    .     However, it is true that for all integers k,
              3                                                        3
                                   
    sec  3  +    k     = ± sec     3    = ±2. (Can you show this?) As a result,

                                                 sec2      +    k         = ± sec 3 2
                                                        3                 = (±2)2

                                                                          =4

    The same holds for the family x = 23 + k. The solutions which lie in [0, 2) come from
                                                                    3 ,   23 ,  4         53 .

5. The equation tan          x    = -3 has the form tan(u) = -3, whose solution is u = arctan(-3)+k.

             x
     Hence,  2   =  arctan(-3) + k,       so  x  =  2 arctan(-3) + 2k  for  integers    k.   To  check,    we  note

             tan 2 2 arctan(-3)+2k        = tan (arctan(-3) + k)

                                          = tan (arctan(-3))           (the period of tangent is )

                                          = -3                                  (See Theorem 10.27)

     To determine which of our answers lie in the interval [0, 2), we first need to get an idea of

     the value of 2 arctan(-3). While we could easily find an approximation using a calculator,5

     we proceed analytically. Since -3 < 0, it follows that - 2 < arctan(-3) < 0. Multiplying
     through by 2 gives - < 2 arctan(-3) < 0. We are now in a position to argue which of the

     solutions x = 2 arctan(-3) + 2k lie in [0, 2). For k = 0, we get x = 2 arctan(-3) < 0,

     so we discard this answer and all answers x = 2 arctan(-3) + 2k where k < 0. Next, we

     turn our attention to k = 1 and get x = 2 arctan(-3) + 2. Starting with the inequality

     - < 2 arctan(-3) < 0, we add 2 and get  < 2 arctan(-3) + 2 < 2. This means

     x = 2 arctan(-3) + 2 lies in [0, 2). Advancing k to 2 produces x = 2 arctan(-3) + 4. Once

     again, we get from - < 2 arctan(-3) < 0 that 3 < 2 arctan(-3) + 4 < 4. Since this is

     outside the interval [0, 2), we discard x = 2 arctan(-3) + 4 and all solutions of the form

     x = 2 arctan(-3) + 2k for k > 2. Graphically, we see y = tan            x          and y = -3 intersect only
                                                                             2

     once on [0, 2) at x = 2 arctan(-3) + 2  3.7851.

6. To solve sin(2x) = 0.87, we first note that it has the form sin(u) = 0.87, which has the family

     of solutions u = arcsin(0.87) + 2k or u =  - arcsin(0.87) + 2k for integers k. Since the

     argument of sine here is 2x, we get 2x = arcsin(0.87) + 2k or 2x =  - arcsin(0.87) + 2k

     which   gives  x  =  1  arcsin(0.87) + k      or  x  =     -  1  arcsin(0.87) + k  for  integers  k.  To  check,

get   a  better             estimate     of         -  1  arcsin(0.87).            From      the    inequality       0   <     1  arcsin(0.87)   <    4 ,
                                               2       2                                                                       2
                                                                                                                         1                       4 ,
we    first    multiply         through           by   -1     and      then     add    2     to     get  2  >     2  -   2  arcsin(0.87)      >       or

   <        -   1  arcsin(0.87)             <  2 .  Proceeding         with     the    usual        arguments,       we  find     the   only  solutions
4     2         2
                                                                                                                                  1
which       lie    in    [0, 2)    correspond             to  k    =      0  and    k  =        1,  namely     x     =   2  -     2  arcsin(0.87)  and

x=    3      -     1  arcsin(0.87).            All     told,  we   have         found  four         solutions  to    sin(2x) = 0.87        in  [0, 2):
      2            2
      1                                     1                                             1                                    3        1
x  =  2  arcsin(0.87),             x  =     2  arcsin(0.87) + ,              x  =  2  -   2  arcsin(0.87)      and      x   =  2     -  2  arcsin(0.87).

By graphing y = sin(2x) and y = 0.87, we confirm our results.

                      y = tan         x     and y = -3                                              y = sin(2x) and y = 0.87

862                                                   Foundations of Trigonometry

Each of the problems in Example 10.7.1 featured one trigonometric function. If an equation involves
two different trigonometric functions or if the equation contains the same trigonometric function
but with different arguments, we will need to use identities and Algebra to reduce the equation to
the same form as those given on page 857.

Example 10.7.2. Solve the following equations and list the solutions which lie in the interval
[0, 2). Verify your solutions on [0, 2) graphically.

1. 3 sin3(x) = sin2(x)                                2. sec2(x) = tan(x) + 3

3. cos(2x) = 3 cos(x) - 2                             4. cos(3x) = 2 - cos(x)
                                                                       
5. cos(3x) = cos(5x)
                                                      6. sin(2x) = 3 cos(x)
7. sin(x) cos  x  + cos(x) sin  x  =1                                
               2                2
                                                      8. cos(x) - 3 sin(x) = 2

Solution.

1. We resist the temptation to divide both sides of 3 sin3(x) = sin2(x) by sin2(x) (What goes
   wrong if you do?) and instead gather all of the terms to one side of the equation and factor.

                             3 sin3(x) = sin2(x)

                  3 sin3(x) - sin2(x) = 0

               sin2(x)(3 sin(x) - 1) = 0              Factor out sin2(x) from both terms.

     We get sin2(x) = 0 or 3 sin(x) - 1 = 0. Solving for sin(x), we find sin(x) = 0 or sin(x) = 13 .
     The solution to the first equation is x = k, with x = 0 and x =  being the two solutions

     which lie in [0, 2). To solve sin(x) = 13 , we use the arcsine function to get x = arcsin  1  +2k
                                                                                                3
                          1
     or x =  - arcsin     3  + 2k for integers k. We find the two solutions here which lie in [0, 2)

     to be x = arcsin  1     and x =  - arcsin  1  .  To check graphically, we plot y = 3(sin(x))3 and
                       3                        3
     y = (sin(x))2 and find the x-coordinates of the intersection points of these two curves. Some

     extra zooming is required near x = 0 and x =  to verify that these two curves do in fact

     intersect four times.6

2. Analysis of sec2(x) = tan(x) + 3 reveals two different trigonometric functions, so an identity
   is in order. Since sec2(x) = 1 + tan2(x), we get

                             sec2(x) = tan(x) + 3

                             1 + tan2(x) = tan(x) + 3 (Since sec2(x) = 1 + tan2(x).)

               tan2(x) - tan(x) - 2 = 0

                             u2 - u - 2 = 0           Let u = tan(x).

                       (u + 1)(u - 2) = 0

    6Note that we are not counting the point (2, 0) in our solution set since x = 2 is not in the interval [0, 2). In
the forthcoming solutions, remember that while x = 2 may be a solution to the equation, it isn't counted among
the solutions in [0, 2).
10.7 Trigonometric Equations and Inequalities                                                                 863

This gives u = -1 or u = 2. Since u = tan(x), we have tan(x) = -1 or tan(x) = 2. From

tan(x) = -1, we get x = - 4 + k for integers k. To solve tan(x) = 2, we employ the
arctangent function and get x = arctan(2) + k for integers k. From the first set of solutions,

we  get  x  =  3  and  x  =   7  as  our  answers   which  lie  in  [0, 2).   Using  the  same   sort  of  argument
               4              4

we saw in Example 10.7.1, we get x = arctan(2) and x =  + arctan(2) as answers from our

second set of solutions which lie in [0, 2). Using a reciprocal identity, we rewrite the secant

as  a  cosine  and  graph  y  =       1     and  y  =  tan(x) + 3   to  find  the  x-values  of  the  points  where
                                 (cos(x))2

they intersect.

       y = 3(sin(x))3 and y = (sin(x))2                             y  =       1     and  y  =   tan(x) + 3
                                                                          (cos(x))2

3. In the equation cos(2x) = 3 cos(x) - 2, we have the same circular function, namely cosine, on
   both sides but the arguments differ. Using the identity cos(2x) = 2 cos2(x) - 1, we obtain a

   `quadratic in disguise' and proceed as we have done in the past.

                              cos(2x) = 3 cos(x) - 2

                       2 cos2(x) - 1 = 3 cos(x) - 2 (Since cos(2x) = 2 cos2(x) - 1.)

            2 cos2(x) - 3 cos(x) + 1 = 0

                       2u2 - 3u + 1 = 0                                                 Let u = cos(x).

                    (2u - 1)(u - 1) = 0

This gives u =      1  or u = 1.     Since u = cos(x), we get cos(x) =               1  or cos(x) = 1.     Solving
                    2                                                                2
            12 , we get x =                         53 + 2k
cos(x) =                      3  +   2k     or x =              for integers k.      From cos(x) = 1, we get

x = 2k for integers k. The answers which lie in [0, 2) are x = 0, 3 , and 53 . Graphing

y = cos(2x) and y = 3 cos(x) - 2, we find, after a little extra effort, that the curves intersect

in three places on [0, 2), and the x-coordinates of these points confirm our results.

4. To solve cos(3x) = 2 - cos(x), we use the same technique as in the previous problem. From
   Example 10.4.3, number 4, we know that cos(3x) = 4 cos3(x) - 3 cos(x). This transforms the

   equation into a polynomial in terms of cos(x).

                                            cos(3x) = 2 - cos(x)

                           4 cos3(x) - 3 cos(x) = 2 - cos(x)

                       2 cos3(x) - 2 cos(x) - 2 = 0

                                     4u3 - 2u - 2 = 0                     Let u = cos(x).
864                                                                              Foundations of Trigonometry

     To solve 4u3 - 2u - 2 = 0, we need the techniques in Chapter 3 to factor 4u3 - 2u - 2 into
     (u - 1) 4u2 + 4u + 2 . We get either u - 1 = 0 or 4u2 + 2u + 2 = 0, and since the discriminant
     of the latter is negative, the only real solution to 4u3 - 2u - 2 = 0 is u = 1. Since u = cos(x),
     we get cos(x) = 1, so x = 2k for integers k. The only solution which lies in [0, 2) is x = 0.
     Graphing y = cos(3x) and y = 2 - cos(x) on the same set of axes over [0, 2) shows that the
     graphs intersect at what appears to be (0, 1), as required.

     y = cos(2x) and y = 3 cos(x) - 2                                         y = cos(3x) and y = 2 - cos(x)

5. While we could approach cos(3x) = cos(5x) in the same manner as we did the previous two

     problems, we choose instead to showcase the utility of the Sum to Product Identities. From

     cos(3x) = cos(5x), we get cos(5x) - cos(3x) = 0, and it is the presence of 0 on the right

     hand side that indicates a switch to a product would be a good move.7 Using Theorem 10.21,

     we have that cos(5x) - cos(3x) = -2 sin                5x+3x     sin       5x-3x    = -2 sin(4x) sin(x). Hence,
                                                               2                   2

     the equation cos(5x) = cos(3x) is equivalent to -2 sin(4x) sin(x) = 0. From this, we get

     sin(4x) = 0 or sin(x) = 0. Solving sin(4x) = 0 gives x = 4 k for integers k, and the solution
     to sin(x) = 0 is x = k for integers k. The second set of solutions is contained in the first set

     of solutions,8 so our final solution to cos(5x) = cos(3x) is x = 4 k for integers k. There are
                                                                      4 ,  2 ,  34 ,     54 ,  3         74 .
     eight  of  these  answers  which  lie  in  [0, 2):  x  =     0,                  ,        2    and        Our  plot  of  the

     graphs of y = cos(3x) and y = cos(5x) below (after some careful zooming) bears this out.

                                                     
6. In examining the equation sin(2x) = 3 cos(x), not only do we have different circular func-

     tions involved, namely sine and cosine, we also have different arguments to contend with,

     namely 2x and x. Using the identity sin(2x) = 2 sin(x) cos(x) makes all of the arguments the

     same and we proceed as we would solving any nonlinear equation - gather all of the nonzero

     terms on one side of the equation and factor.

                                                          
                                         sin(2x) = 3 cos(x)
                                2 sin(x) cos(x) = 3 cos(x) (Since sin(2x) = 2 sin(x) cos(x).)
                2 sin(x) cos(x) - 3 cos(x) = 0
                      cos(x)(2 sin(x) - 3) = 0

                                                            
                                                            32 .                                                    
     from which we get cos(x) = 0 or sin(x) =                     From cos(x) = 0,             we obtain x =        2  + k    for
                                
                                32 ,                                             23 + 2k
     integers k. From sin(x) =         we   get  x  =    3  +  2k     or   x  =                for  integers   k.  The  answers

which  lie   in  [0, 2)   are  x=    2 ,  32 ,     and  23 .  We   graph  y  = sin(2x)  and     y                and,
                                                3                                                  = 3 cos(x)

after some careful zooming, verify our answers.

          y = cos(3x) and y = cos(5x)                                                          
                                                                   y = sin(2x) and y = 3 cos(x)

7. Unlike the previous problem, there seems to be no quick way to get the circular functions or

their arguments to match in the equation sin(x) cos                x      + cos(x) sin  x       = 1. If we stare at
                                                                   2                    2

it long enough, however, we realize that the left hand side is the expanded form of the sum

formula for sin x + x2 . Hence, our original equation is equivalent to sin 32 x = 1. Solving,
                       43 k                                                                                         53 .
we  find  x  =   3  +        for  integers  k.     Two  of  these  solutions  lie  in  [0, 2):  x  =  3  and  x  =

Graphing y = sin(x) cos           x  + cos(x) sin       x   and y = 1 validates our solutions.

8. With the absence of double angles or squares, there doesn't seem to be much we can do.
   However, since the arguments of the cosine and sine are the same, we can rewrite the left
   hand side of this equation as a sinusoid.9 To fit f (x) = cos(x) - 3 sin(x) to the form
   A sin(t + ) + B, we use what we learned in Example 10.5.3 and find A = 2, B = 0,  = 1
   and  = 56 . Hence, we can rewrite the equation cos(x) - 3 sin(x) = 2 as 2 sin x + 56 = 2,
   or sin x + 56 = 1. Solving the latter, we get x = - 3 + 2k for integers k. Only one of
   these solutions, x = 53 , which corresponds to k = 1, lies in [0, 2). Geometrically, we see
                           
   that y = cos(x) - 3 sin(x) and y = 2 intersect just once, supporting our answer.

    y = sin(x) cos     x     + cos(x) sin       x  and y = 1                           
                       2                        2                     y = cos(x) - 3 sin(x) and y = 2

We repeat here the advice given when solving systems of nonlinear equations in section 8.7 - when
it comes to solving equations involving the trigonometric functions, it helps to just try something.

    9We are essentially `undoing' the sum / difference formula for cosine or sine, depending on which form we use, so
this problem is actually closely related to the previous one!

Next, we focus on solving inequalities involving the trigonometric functions. Since these functions
are continuous on their domains, we may use the sign diagram technique we've used in the past to
solve the inequalities.10

Example 10.7.3. Solve the following inequalities on [0, 2). Express your answers using interval
notation and verify your answers graphically.

1. 2 sin(x)  1                              2. sin(2x) > cos(x)                               3. tan(x)  3

Solution.

1. We begin solving 2 sin(x)  1 by collecting all of the terms on one side of the equation and

     zero on the other to get 2 sin(x) - 1  0. Next, we let f (x) = 2 sin(x) - 1 and note that our

     original inequality is equivalent to solving f (x)  0. We now look to see where, if ever, f is

     undefined and where f (x) = 0. Since the domain of f is all real numbers, we can immediately

     set about finding the zeros of f . Solving f (x) = 0, we have 2 sin(x) - 1 = 0 or sin(x) = 12 .
                                                                 5
     The   solutions  here   are   x  =  6  + 2k      and  x  =  6   + 2k        for  integers     k.  Since     we  are  restricting

     our   attention  to     [0, 2),  only  x=        and    x=      5   are    of  concern      to  us.  Next,      we  choose    test
                                                   6                 6

     values in [0, 2) other than the zeros and determine if f is positive or negative there. For

     x  =  0  we  have   f (0)  =   -1,    for  x  =     we   get    f          = 1 and for x =  we get f () = -1.
                                                      2                    2

     Since our original inequality is equivalent to f (x)  0, we are looking for where the function

     is negative (-) or 0, and we get the intervals 0, 6  56 , 2 . We can confirm our answer
     graphically by seeing where the graph of y = 2 sin(x) crosses or is below the graph of y = 1.

                    (-) 0 (+) 0 (-)

                                                                                    y = 2 sin(x) and y = 1

2. We first rewrite sin(2x) > cos(x) as sin(2x) - cos(x) > 0 and let f (x) = sin(2x) - cos(x).

     Our original inequality is thus equivalent to f (x) > 0. The domain of f is all real numbers,

     so we can advance to finding the zeros of f . Setting f (x) = 0 yields sin(2x) - cos(x) = 0,

     which, by way of the double angle identity for sine, becomes 2 sin(x) cos(x) - cos(x) = 0 or

     cos(x)(2 sin(x)-1)      =  0.    From  cos(x)    =  0,  we  get    x  =     +    k  for  integers    k  of  which    only  x  =  
                                                                              2                                                       2
                 3                                                                            1                           
     and   x  =  2  lie  in  [0, 2).   For  2 sin(x) - 1      =  0,  we    get  sin(x)   =    2  which    gives  x   =    6  + 2k     or

     x  =  5  + 2k    for    integers  k.   Of  those,   only    x   =     and   x  =    5    lie  in  [0, 2).   Next,    we    choose
           6                                                            6                6

our   test  values.  For   x=0    we    find    f (0) = -1;   when   x=     4  we  get  f  4
                                                     
            3              3      = -1 + 22 =          22-2 ; when x =  we have f () = 1, and lastly, for
for  x  =   4  we  get  f  4                         

x = 74 we get f 74 = -1 - 22 = -2- 2 2 . We see f (x) > 0 on 6 , 2  56 , 32 , so this is

our answer. We can use the calculator to check that the graph of y = sin(2x) is indeed above

the graph of y = cos(x) on those intervals.

3. Proceeding as in the last two problems, we rewrite tan(x)  3 as tan(x) - 3  0 and let

f (x) = tan(x) - 3.        We     note  that     on  [0, 2),  f  is  undefined     at   x  =     and  32 ,  so  those
                                                                                              2
values will need the usual disclaimer on the sign diagram.11 Moving along to zeros, solving

f (x) = tan(x) - 3 = 0 requires the arctangent function. We find x = arctan(3) + k for

integers k and of these, only x = arctan(3) and x = arctan(3) +  lie in [0, 2). Since

3  >  0,  we   know  0  <  arctan(3)    <        which  allows   us  to  position  these   zeros  correctly  on  the
                                             2

sign diagram. To choose test values, we begin with x = 0 and find f (0) = -3. Finding a

convenient test value in the interval            arctan(3),         is a bit more challenging. Keep in mind
                                                              2
that the arctangent function is increasing and is bounded above by 2 . This means that
the number x = arctan(117) is guaranteed12 to lie between arctan(3) and 2 . We see that

f (arctan(117)) = tan(arctan(117)) - 3 = 114. For our next test value, we take x =  and

find f () = -3. To find our next test value, we note that since arctan(3) < arctan(117) < 2 ,
it follows13 that arctan(3) +  < arctan(117) +  < 32 . Evaluating f at x = arctan(117) + 
yields f (arctan(117) + ) = tan(arctan(117) + ) - 3 = tan(arctan(117)) - 3 = 114. We

choose    our  last  test  value  to  be  x   =  7   and  find   f   7   = -4. Since we want f (x)  0, we
                                                 4                   4
                                                                         3
see that our answer is        arctan(3),      2      arctan(3)   +   ,   2  .  Using the graphs of y = tan(x)

and y = 3, we see when the graph of the former is above (or meets) the graph of the latter.

Our next example puts solving equations and inequalities to good use - finding domains of functions.
Example 10.7.4. Express the domain of the following functions using extended interval notation.14

1.   f (x) = csc  2x  +               2. f (x) = sin(x)                 3. f (x) = 1 - cot(x)
                         3                          2 cos(x) - 1

Solution.

1. To find the domain of f (x) = csc 2x + 3 , we rewrite f in terms of sine as f (x) = 1 sin(2x+  . 3 )
   Since the sine function is defined everywhere, our only concern comes from zeros in the denom-

     inator.  Solving sin   2x  +     = 0, we get x = - 6 + 2 k for integers k. In set-builder notation,
                                   3
     our domain is x : x = - 6 + 2 k for integers k . To help visualize the domain, we follow the
     old mantra `When in doubt, write it out!' We get x : x = - 6 , 26 , - 46 , 56 , - 76 , 86 , . . . ,

     where we have kept the denominators 6 throughout to help see the pattern. Graphing the

     situation on a numberline, we have

                                      - 76 - 46 - 6  2            5  8

                                                      6           6  6

     Proceeding as we did on page 756 in Section 10.3.1, we let xk denote the kth number excluded
                                                      (3k-1)
     from the domain and we have xk   = - 6  + 2 k =       6         for integers k.  The intervals which

     comprise the domain are of the form (xk, xk + 1) = 6 (3k-1) , 6 (3k+2) as k runs through the

     integers. Using extended interval notation, we have that the domain is

                                           (3k - 1) , (3k + 2)
                                      k=-    6                    6

     We can check our answer by substituting in values of k to see that it matches our diagram.

14See page 756 for details about this notation.

2. Since the domains of sin(x) and cos(x) are all real numbers, the only concern when finding

the domain of f (x) = 2 cos(x)-1 sin(x) is division by zero so we set the denominator equal to zero and

solve.  From  2 cos(x)-1  =  0  we   get  cos(x)  =  1  so  that  x  =     +  2  k  or  x  =  53 +2k      for  integers
                                                     2                  3
                                                                                           5
k. Using set-builder notation, the domain is         x  :  x  =  3  +   2k  and x   =      3  +  2k  for  integers  k    ,

or x : x = ± 3 , ± 53 , ± 73 , ± 11 3 , . . . , so we have

                      - 11 3 - 73 - 53 - 3                           5      7       11

                                                            3        3        3         3

Unlike the previous example, we have two different families of points to consider, and we
present two ways of dealing with this kind of situation. One way is to generalize what we
did in the previous example and use the formulas we found in our domain work to describe
the intervals. To that end, we let ak = 3 + 2k = 3 (6k+1) and bk = 35 + 2k = 3 (6k+5) for
integers k. The goal now is to write the domain in terms of the a's an b's. We find a0 = 3 ,
a1 = 73 , a-1 = - 53 , a2 = 13 3 , a-2 = - 11 3 , b0 = 53 , b1 = 11 3 , b-1 = - 3 , b2 = 17 3 and
b-2 = - 73 . Hence, in terms of the a's and b's, our domain is

        . . . (a-2, b-2)  (b-2, a-1)  (a-1, b-1)  (b-1, a0)  (a0, b0)  (b0, a1)  (a1, b1)  . . .

If we group these intervals in pairs, (a-2, b-2)  (b-2, a-1), (a-1, b-1)  (b-1, a0), (a0, b0)  (b0, a1)
and so forth, we see a pattern emerge of the form (ak, bk)  (bk, ak + 1) for integers k so that
our domain can be written as

          (6k + 1) (6k + 5) (6k + 5) (6k + 7)
           (ak, bk)  (bk, ak + 1) =                  3, 3  3, 3

k=-                                  k=-

A second approach to the problem exploits the periodic nature of f . Since cos(x) and sin(x)

have period 2, it's not too difficult to show the function f repeats itself every 2 units.15

This means if we can find a formula for the domain on an interval of length 2, we can express

the entire domain by translating our answer left and right on the x-axis by adding integer

multiples of 2. One such interval that arises from our domain work is 3 , 37 . The portion
of the domain here is 3 , 35  35 , 37 . Adding integer multiples of 2, we get the family of
                      5              53 + 2k, 73 + 2k
intervals  3  +  2k,  3  +  2k                                    for integers k. We leave it to the reader

to show that getting common denominators leads to our previous answer.

  15This doesn't necessarily mean the period of f is 2. The tangent function is comprised of cos(x) and sin(x), but
its period is half theirs. The reader is invited to investigate the period of f .

3. To find the domain of f (x) = 1 - cot(x), we first note that, due to the presence of the

     cot(x) term, x = k for integers k. Next, we recall that for the square root to be defined, we

     need 1-cot(x)  0. Unlike the inequalities we solved in Example 10.7.3, we are not restricted

     here to a given interval. Our strategy is to solve this inequality over (0, ) (the same interval

     which generates a fundamental cycle of cotangent) and then add integer multiples of the

     period, in this case, . We let g(x) = 1 - cot(x) and set about making a sign diagram for g

     over the interval (0, ) to find where g(x)  0. We note that g is undefined for x = k for

     integers k, in particular, at the endpoints of our interval x = 0 and x = . Next, we look

     for the zeros of g.     Solving g(x) = 0, we get cot(x) = 1 or x =                     +  k  for   integers  k  and
                                                                                         4
                                  4 ,                                                                      2 ,
     only one of these,      x=        lies in (0, ).   Choosing the test values x =           6  and x =         we get
          
     g 6 = 1 - 3, and g 2 = 1.

                                                              4

     We find g(x)  0 on 4 ,  . Adding multiples of the period we get our solution to consist of

     the intervals        +  k,   +    k   =      4 (4k+1) , (k + 1) . Using extended interval notation, we
                       4

     express our final answer as

Solution.

1.   To  solve  arcsin(2x)   =   3 ,   we  first  note  that     is  in  the  range  of  the   arcsine  function  (so  a
                                                              3

     solution exists!) Next, we exploit the inverse property of sine and arcsine from Theorem 10.26
10.7 Trigonometric Equations and Inequalities                                                                871

                           arcsin(2x)       =     
                                                  3
                                                        
                    sin (arcsin(2x))        =     sin   3

                                                  
                                                   3
                                       2x =       2           Since sin(arcsin(u)) = u

                                                  
                                         x = 34

                                                                                                       
Graphing y = arcsin(2x) and the horizontal line y = 3 , we see they intersect at                        3
                                                                                                       4     0.4430.

2. Our first step in solving 4 arccos(x) - 3 = 0 is to isolate the arccosine. Doing so, we get

arccos(x)  =  34 .  Since  3  is  in  the  range  of    arccosine,  we    may  apply  Theorem        10.26
                           4

                           arccos(x)        =     3
                                                  4

                    cos (arccos(x))         =  cos      3
                                                        4
                                                  
                                       x = - 22
                                                              Since cos(arccos(u)) = u

                                                                                                   
                                                                                                    2
The  calculator  confirms  y  =   4 arccos(x) - 3         crosses   y  =  0  (the  x-axis)  at  -  2       -0.7071.

     y     =  arcsin(2x)   and    y   =                                      y = 4 arccos(x) - 3
                                         3

3. From 3 arcsec(2x - 1) +  = 2, we get arcsec(2x - 1) = 3 . As we saw in Section 10.6,
   there are two possible ranges for the arcsecant function. Fortunately, both ranges contain 3 .
   Applying Theorem 10.28 / 10.29, we get

                           arcsec(2x - 1)      =     
                                                     3

                    sec(arcsec(2x - 1))        =     sec   
                                                           3

                                  2x - 1 = 2                     Since sec(arcsec(u)) = u

                                           x = 32

To check using our calculator, we need to graph y = 3 arcsec(2x - 1) + . To do so, we make

use of the identity arcsec(u) = arccos         1  from Theorems 10.28 and 10.29.16 We see the graph
                                               u

of y = 3 arccos       1    +      and  the  horizontal     line  y  =  2  intersect  at  3  =   1.5.
                    2x-1                                                                 2

  16Since we are checking for solutions where arcsecant is positive, we know u = 2x - 1  1, and so the identity
applies in both cases.

4. With the presence of both arctan2(x) ( = (arctan(x))2) and arctan(x), we substitute u =

   arctan(x). The equation 4 arctan2(x) - 3 arctan(x) - 2 = 0 becomes 4u2 - 3u - 2 = 0.

   Factoring,17 we get (4u + )(u - ) = 0, so u = arctan(x) = - 4 or u = arctan(x) = . Since
   - 4 is in the range of arctangent, but  is not, we only get solutions from the first equation.
   Using Theorem 10.27, we get

           arctan(x) = - 4                                  Since tan(arctan(u)) = u.
     tan(arctan(x)) = tan - 4

                      x = -1

     The calculator verifies our result.

     y = 3 arcsec(2x - 1) +  and y = 2                      y = 4 arctan2(x) - 3 arctan(x) - 2

5. Since the inverse trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains, we can solve in-

     equalities featuring these functions using sign diagrams. Since all of the nonzero terms of

     2 - 4 arccos2(x) < 0 are on one side of the inequality, we let f (x) = 2 - 4 arccos2(x) and

     note the domain of f is limited by the arccos(x) to [-1, 1]. Next, we find the zeros of f by set-

     ting f (x) = 2 - 4 arccos2(x) = 0. We get arccos(x) = ± 2 , and since the range of arccosine is
     [0, ], we focus our attention on arccos(x) = 2 . Using Theorem 10.26, we get x = cos  
                                                                                           2  =0

     as our only zero. Hence, we have two test intervals, [-1, 0) and (0, 1]. Choosing test values

     x = ±1, we get f (-1) = -32 < 0 and f (1) = 2 > 0. Since we are looking for where

     f (x) = 2 - 4 arccos2(x) < 0, our answer is [-1, 0). The calculator confirms that for these

     values of x, the graph of y = 2 - 4 arccos2(x) is below y = 0 (the x-axis.)

6. To begin, we rewrite 4 arccot(3x) >  as 4 arccot(3x) -  > 0. We let f (x) = 4 arccot(3x) - ,

and note the domain of f is all real numbers, (-, ). To find the zeros of f , we set

f (x)  =  4 arccot(3x) -   =  0  and   solve.  We   get  arccot(3x)     =   4 ,  and     since     is  in  the  range    of
                                                                                                4

arccotangent, we may apply Theorem 10.27 and solve

                           arccot(3x)  =       
                                               4

                   cot(arccot(3x))     =       cot

                                   3x = 1                    Since cot(arccot(u)) = u.

                                       x = 13

Next, we make a sign diagram for f . Since the domain of f is all real numbers, and there is

only one zero of f , x = 13 , we have two test intervals,          -,       1    and     13 ,  . Ideally, we wish
                                                                            3

to find test values x in these intervals so that arccot(4x) corresponds to one of our oft-used

`common'  angles.  After   a  bit  of  computation,18    we     choose   x  =    0  for  x  <   1  and  for  x  >  13 ,  we
                                                                                                3

choose x = 33 . We find f (0) =  > 0 and f                3  = - 3 < 0. Since we are looking for where
                                                         3

f (x) = 4 arccot(3x) -  > 0, we get our answer               -,    1  .    To    check   graphically,      we   use      the
                                                                   3

11.1 Applications of Sinusoids

In the same way exponential functions can be used to model a wide variety of phenomena in nature,1
the cosine and sine functions can be used to model their fair share of natural behaviors. In section
10.5, we introduced the concept of a sinusoid as a function which can be written either in the form
C(x) = A cos(x+)+B for  > 0 or equivalently, in the form S(x) = A sin(x+)+B for  > 0.
At the time, we remained undecided as to which form we preferred, but the time for such indecision
is over. For clarity of exposition we focus on the sine function2 in this section and switch to the
independent variable t, since the applications in this section are time-dependent. We reintroduce
and summarize all of the important facts and definitions about this form of the sinusoid below.

                         Properties of the Sinusoid S(t) = A sin(t + ) + B
       The amplitude is |A|
       The angular frequency is  and the ordinary frequency is f = 

                                                                                                    2
       The period is T = 1 = 2

                                    f
       The phase is  and the phase shift is - 

                                                                 
       The vertical shift or baseline is B

Along with knowing these formulas, it is helpful to remember what these quantities mean in context.
The amplitude measures the maximum displacement of the sine wave from its baseline (determined
by the vertical shift), the period is the length of time it takes to complete one cycle of the sinusoid,
the angular frequency tells how many cycles are completed over an interval of length 2, and the
ordinary frequency measures how many cycles occur per unit of time. The phase indicates what

    1See Section 6.5.
    2Sine haters can use the co-function identity cos 2 -  = sin() to turn all of the sines into cosines.

angle  corresponds to t = 0, and the phase shift represents how much of a `head start' the sinusoid
has over the un-shifted sine function. The figure below is repeated from Section 10.5.

In Section 10.1.1, we introduced the concept of circular motion and in Section 10.2.1, we developed
formulas for circular motion. Our first foray into sinusoidal motion puts these notions to good use.
Example 11.1.1. Recall from Exercise 55 in Section 10.1 that The Giant Wheel at Cedar Point
is a circle with diameter 128 feet which sits on an 8 foot tall platform making its overall height 136
feet. It completes two revolutions in 2 minutes and 7 seconds. Assuming that the riders are at the
edge of the circle, find a sinusoid which describes the height of the passengers above the ground t
seconds after they pass the point on the wheel closest to the ground.
Solution. We sketch the problem situation below and assume a counter-clockwise rotation.3

                                                                                                                          

                                                                                                                      Q

                                                          h
                                                                                       P

                                                                                   O
    3Otherwise, we could just observe the motion of the wheel from the other side.
11.1 Applications of Sinusoids                                                                                                                883

We know from the equations given on page 732 in Section 10.2.1 that the y-coordinate for counter-

clockwise motion on a circle of radius r centered at the origin with constant angular velocity

(frequency)  is given by y = r sin(t). Here, t = 0 corresponds to the point (r, 0) so that , the

angle measuring the amount of rotation, is in standard position. In our case, the diameter of the

wheel is 128 feet, so the radius is r = 64 feet. Since the wheel completes two revolutions in 2

minutes and 7 seconds (which is 127 seconds) the period T                     =  12 (127) =                      127        seconds.     Hence, the
                                                                                                                  2
                                 2      4
angular frequency is  =          T  =   127    radians per second.       Putting these two pieces of information

together, we have that y = 64 sin 127 4 t describes the y-coordinate on the Giant Wheel after t

seconds, assuming it is centered at (0, 0) with t = 0 corresponding to the point Q. In order to find

an expression for h, we take the point O in the figure as the origin. Since the base of the Giant

Wheel ride is 8 feet above the ground and the Giant Wheel itself has a radius of 64 feet, its center

is 72 feet above the ground. To account for this vertical shift upward,4 we add 72 to our formula

for y to obtain the new formula h = y + 72 = 64 sin 127 4 t + 72. Next, we need to adjust things so
that t = 0 corresponds to the point P instead of the point Q. This is where the phase comes into

play.  Geometrically,   we   need   to  shift  the  angle    in  the  figure  back                               radians.   From  Section  10.2.1,
                                                                                                              2
we know  = t = 4 127 t, so we (temporarily) write the height in terms of  as h = 64 sin () + 72.
                                                                          - 2                                               4 127 t - 2
Subtracting    2  from    gives  the  final  answer  h(t)    =   64 sin          + 72 = 64 sin                                           + 72. We

can check the reasonableness of our answer by graphing y = h(t) over the interval 0, 127 2 .

                                                                                                           2

A few remarks about Example 11.1.1 are in order. First, note that the amplitude of 64 in our

answer corresponds to the radius of the Giant Wheel. This means that passengers on the Giant

Wheel never stray more than 64 feet vertically from the center of the Wheel, which makes sense.

Second,   the  phase  shift  of  our  answer   works  out    to  be     /2    =  127                             = 15.875.  This  represents  the
                                                                      4/127       8

`time delay' (in seconds) we introduce by starting the motion at the point P as opposed to the

point Q. Said differently, passengers which `start' at P take 15.875 seconds to `catch up' to the

point Q.

Our next example revisits the daylight data first introduced in Section 2.5, Exercise 6b.

4We are readjusting our `baseline' from y = 0 to y = 72.

     The data certainly appear sinusoidal,5 but when it comes down to it, fitting a sinusoid to

     data manually is not an exact science. We do our best to find the constants A, ,  and B

     so that the function H(t) = A sin(t + ) + B closely matches the data. We first go after

     the vertical shift B whose value determines the baseline. In a typical sinusoid, the value of B

     is  the  average  of  the  maximum  and  minimum  values.  So  here  we  take  B  =  3.3+21.8  =  12.55.
                                                                                               2

     Next is the amplitude A which is the displacement from the baseline to the maximum (and

     minimum) values. We find A = 21.8 - 12.55 = 12.55 - 3.3 = 9.25. At this point, we have

     H(t) = 9.25 sin(t + ) + 12.55. Next, we go after the angular frequency . Since the data

     collected is over the span of a year (12 months), we take the period T = 12 months.6 This

    5Okay, it appears to be the `' shape we saw in some of the graphs in Section 2.2. Just humor us.
    6Even though the data collected lies in the interval [1, 12], which has a length of 11, we need to think of the data
point at t = 1 as a representative sample of the amount of daylight for every day in January. That is, it represents
H(t) over the interval [0, 1]. Similarly, t = 2 is a sample of H(t) over [1, 2], and so forth.

means  =  2  =  2   =  6 .  The last quantity to find is the phase .  Unlike the previous
          T     12
example, it is easier in this case to find the phase shift -  . Since we picked A > 0, the phase
shift corresponds to the first value of t with H(t) = 12.55 (the baseline value).7 Here, we

choose t = 3, since its corresponding H value of 12.4 is closer to 12.55 than the next value,

15.9, which corresponds to t = 4.  Hence, -  = 3, so  = -3 = -3             = - 2 . We have
                                                                      6
H(t) = 9.25 sin 6 t - 2 + 12.55. Below is a graph of our data with the curve y = H(t).

2. Using the `SinReg' command, we graph the calculator's regression below.

       While both models seem to be reasonable fits to the data, the calculator model is possibly
       the better fit. The calculator does not give us an r2 value like it did for linear regressions
       in Section 2.5, nor does it give us an R2 value like it did for quadratic, cubic and quartic
       regressions as in Section 3.1. The reason for this, much like the reason for the absence of R2
       for the logistic model in Section 6.5, is beyond the scope of this course. We'll just have to
       use our own good judgment when choosing the best sinusoid model.

11.1.1 Harmonic Motion

One of the major applications of sinusoids in Science and Engineering is the study of harmonic
motion. The equations for harmonic motion can be used to describe a wide range of phenomena,
from the motion of an object on a spring, to the response of an electronic circuit. In this subsection,
we restrict our attention to modeling a simple spring system. Before we jump into the Mathematics,
there are some Physics terms and concepts we need to discuss. In Physics, `mass' is defined as a
measure of an object's resistance to straight-line motion whereas `weight' is the amount of force
(pull) gravity exerts on an object. An object's mass cannot change,8 while its weight could change.

    7See the figure on page 882.
    8Well, assuming the object isn't subjected to relativistic speeds . . .
886                                              Applications of Trigonometry

An object which weighs 6 pounds on the surface of the Earth would weigh 1 pound on the surface
of the Moon, but its mass is the same in both places. In the English system of units, `pounds' (lbs.)
is a measure of force (weight), and the corresponding unit of mass is the `slug'. In the SI system,
the unit of force is `Newtons' (N) and the associated unit of mass is the `kilogram' (kg). We convert
between mass and weight using the formula9 w = mg. Here, w is the weight of the object, m is the
mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. In the English system, g = 32 second2 feet , and in the SI
system, g = 9.8 second2 meters . Hence, on Earth a mass of 1 slug weighs 32 lbs. and a mass of 1 kg weighs
9.8 N.10 Suppose we attach an object with mass m to a spring as depicted below. The weight of
the object will stretch the spring. The system is said to be in `equilibrium' when the weight of the
object is perfectly balanced with the restorative force of the spring. How far the spring stretches
to reach equilibrium depends on the spring's `spring constant'. Usually denoted by the letter k,
the spring constant relates the force F applied to the spring to the amount d the spring stretches
in accordance with Hooke's Law11 F = kd. If the object is released above or below the equilibrium
position, or if the object is released with an upward or downward velocity, the object will bounce
up and down on the end of the spring until some external force stops it. If we let x(t) denote the
object's displacement from the equilibrium position at time t, then x(t) = 0 means the object is at
the equilibrium position, x(t) < 0 means the object is above the equilibrium position, and x(t) > 0
means the object is below the equilibrium position. The function x(t) is called the `equation of
motion' of the object.12

        x(t) = 0 at the     x(t) < 0 above the    x(t) > 0 below the
     equilibrium position  equilibrium position  equilibrium position

If we ignore all other influences on the system except gravity and the spring force, then Physics
tells us that gravity and the spring force will battle each other forever and the object will oscillate
indefinitely. In this case, we describe the motion as `free' (meaning there is no external force causing
the motion) and `undamped' (meaning we ignore friction caused by surrounding medium, which
in our case is air). The following theorem, which comes from Differential Equations, gives x(t) as
a function of the mass m of the object, the spring constant k, the initial displacement x0 of the

    9This is a consequence of Newton's Second Law of Motion F = ma where F is force, m is mass and a is acceleration.
In our present setting, the force involved is weight which is caused by the acceleration due to gravity.

  10Note that 1 pound = 1 second2 slug foot and 1 Newton = 1 second2 kg meter .
  11Look familiar? We saw Hooke's Law in Section 4.3.1.
  12To keep units compatible, if we are using the English system, we use feet (ft.) to measure displacement. If we
are in the SI system, we measure displacement in meters (m). Time is always measured in seconds (s).
11.1 Applications of Sinusoids                                                                                     887

object and initial velocity v0 of the object. As with x(t), x0 = 0 means the object is released from
the equilibrium position, x0 < 0 means the object is released above the equilibrium position and
x0 > 0 means the object is released below the equilibrium position. As far as the initial velocity v0
is concerned, v0 = 0 means the object is released `from rest,' v0 < 0 means the object is heading
upwards and v0 > 0 means the object is heading downwards.13

Theorem 11.1. Equation for Free Undamped Harmonic Motion: Suppose an object of
mass m is suspended from a spring with spring constant k. If the initial displacement from the
equilibrium position is x0 and the initial velocity of the object is v0, then the displacement x
from the equilibrium position at time t is given by x(t) = A sin(t + ) where

 =             k and A =       x20 +          v0 2
               m                              

 A sin() = x0 and A cos() = v0.

It is a great exercise in `dimensional analysis' to verify that the formulas given in Theorem 11.1

work  out  so  that      has   units  1  and  A  has  units  ft.  or  m,  depending   on    which  system  we  choose.
                                      s

Example 11.1.3. Suppose an object weighing 64 pounds stretches a spring 8 feet.

1. If the object is attached to the spring and released 3 feet below the equilibrium position from
   rest, find the equation of motion of the object, x(t). When does the object first pass through
   the equilibrium position? Is the object heading upwards or downwards at this instant?

2. If the object is attached to the spring and released 3 feet below the equilibrium position with
   an upward velocity of 8 feet per second, find the equation of motion of the object, x(t). What
   is the longest distance the object travels above the equilibrium position? When does this first
   happen? Confirm your result using a graphing utility.

Solution. In order to use the formulas in Theorem 11.1, we first need to determine the spring
constant k and the mass of the object m. To find k, we use Hooke's Law F = kd. We know the
object weighs 64 lbs. and stretches the spring 8 ft.. Using F = 64 and d = 8, we get 64 = k · 8, or
k = 8 lbs. ft. . To find m, we use w = mg with w = 64 lbs. and g = 32 fts2. . We get m = 2 slugs. We can
now proceed to apply Theorem 11.1.

1. With k = 8 and m = 2, we get  =                    km =        8   =  2.  We  are  told  that  the  object  is  released
                                                                  2

      3 feet below the equilibrium position `from rest.' This means x0 = 3 and v0 = 0. Therefore,
      A = x20 + v0 2 = 32 + 02 = 3. To determine the phase , we have A sin() = x0,
                                                                                      
      which    in  this  case  gives  3 sin() = 3     so  sin() = 1.      Only   =    2  and  angles   coterminal  to   it

  13The sign conventions here are carried over from Physics. If not for the spring, the object would fall towards the
ground, which is the `natural' or `positive' direction. Since the spring force acts in direct opposition to gravity, any
movement upwards is considered `negative'.
888                                                                                    Applications of Trigonometry

     satisfy this condition, so we pick14 the phase to be  = 2 . Hence, the equation of motion
                                   
     is x(t) = 3 sin        2t  +  2  .   To find when the object passes through the equilibrium position we

     solve x(t) = 3 sin         2t    +         = 0. Going through the usual analysis we find t = - 4 + 2 k for
                                         2

     integers k. Since we are interested in the first time the object passes through the equilibrium

     position,      we  look    for   the   smallest        positive  t  value  which  in  this  case  is  t  =        0.78  seconds
                                                                                                                 4

     after the start of the motion. Common sense suggests that if we release the object below the

     equilibrium position, the object should be traveling upwards when it first passes through it.

     To check this answer, we graph one cycle of x(t). Since our applied domain in this situation

     is  t     0,   and  the    period      of  x(t)    is  T  =   2  =  2  =   ,  we   graph    x(t)  over   the      interval  [0, ].
                                                                         2

     Remembering that x(t) > 0 means the object is below the equilibrium position and x(t) < 0

     means the object is above the equilibrium position, the fact our graph is crossing through the

     t-axis    from  positive      x  to    negative    x   at  t  =     confirms  our  answer.
                                                                      4

2. The only difference between this problem and the previous problem is that we now release

     the object with an upward velocity of 8 fts . We still have  = 2 and x0 = 3, but now
     we have v0 = -8, the negative indicating the velocity is directed upwards. Here, we get

     A = x02 + v0 2 = 32 + (-4)2 = 5. From A sin() = x0, we get 5 sin() = 3 which gives

     sin() = 35 . From A cos() = v0, we get 10 cos() = -8, or cos() = - 45 . This means
     that  is a Quadrant II angle which we can describe in terms of either arcsine or arccosine.

     Since x(t) is expressed in terms of sine, we choose to express  =  - arcsin                                       3  .  Hence,
                                                                                                                       5
                                                     3
     x(t) = 5 sin        2t +    - arcsin            5      . Since the amplitude of x(t) is 5, the object will travel

     at most 5 feet above the equilibrium position. To find when this happens, we solve the

     equation x(t) = 5 sin            2t +       - arcsin          3     = -5, the negative once again signifying that
                                                                   5

     the object is above the equilibrium position. Going through the usual machinations, we get

     t   =  1  arcsin    3  +        +   k      for  integers     k.  The smallest of these values occurs when k = 0,

     answer using the calculator, we graph y = 5 sin                        2x +    - arcsin      3        on a graphing utility
                                                                                                  5

It is possible, though beyond the scope of this course, to model the effects of friction and other
external forces acting on the system.15 While we may not have the Physics and Calculus background

  14For confirmation, we note that A cos() = v0, which in this case reduces to 6 cos() = 0.
  15Take a good Differential Equations class to see this!
11.1 Applications of Sinusoids                                                             889

to derive equations of motion for these scenarios, we can certainly analyze them. We examine three
cases in the following example.

Example 11.1.4.

1. Write x(t) = 5e-t/5 cos(t) + 5e-t/53 sin(t) in the form x(t) = A(t) sin(t + ). Graph x(t)

using a graphing utility.

                                             
2. Write x(t) = (t + 3) 2 cos(2t) + (t + 3) 2 sin(2t) in the form x(t) = A(t) sin(t + ). Graph

x(t) using a graphing utility.

3. Find the period of x(t) = 5 sin(6t) - 5 sin (8t). Graph x(t) using a graphing utility.

Solution.

   1. We start rewriting x(t) = 5e-t/5 cos(t) + 5e-t/53 sin(t) by factoring out 5e-t/5 from both
                                                         

       terms to get x(t) = 5e-t/5 cos(t) + 3 sin(t) . We convert what's left in parentheses to

       the required form using the formulas introduced in Exercise 36 from Section 10.5. We find
        cos(t) + 3 sin(t) = 2 sin t + 3 so that x(t) = 10e-t/5 sin t + 3 . Graphing this on the
       calculator as y = 10e-x/5 sin x + 3 reveals some interesting behavior. The sinusoidal nature
       continues indefinitely, but it is being attenuated. In the sinusoid A sin(x + ), the coefficient
       A of the sine function is the amplitude. In the case of y = 10e-x/5 sin x + 3 , we can think
       of the function A(x) = 10e-x/5 as the amplitude. As x  , 10e-x/5  0 which means the
       amplitude continues to shrink towards zero. Indeed, if we graph y = ±10e-x/5 along with
       y = 10e-x/5 sin x + 3 , we see this attenuation taking place. This equation corresponds to
       the motion of an object on a spring where there is a slight force which acts to `damp', or slow

       the motion. An example of this kind of force would be the friction of the object against the

       air. In this model, the object oscillates forever, but with smaller and smaller amplitude.

y = 10e-x/5 sin x + 3                          y = 10e-x/5 sin x + 3 , y = ±10e-x/5

                                               
2. Proceeding asin the first example, we factor out (t + 3) 2 from each term in the function
x(t) = (t + 3) 2 cos(2t) + (t + 3) 2 sin(2t) to get x(t) = (t + 3) 2(cos(2t) + sin(2t)). We find
(cos(2t) + sin(2t)) =  2 sin    2t  +     , so x(t) = 2(t + 3) sin  2t  +     .  Graphing this on the
                                       4                                   4
                                          
calculator as y = 2(x + 3) sin  2x     +  4  , we find the sinusoid's amplitude growing.   Since our

amplitude function here is A(x) = 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6, which continues to grow without bound
890                                                       Applications of Trigonometry

     as x  , this is hardly surprising. The phenomenon illustrated here is `forced' motion.
     That is, we imagine that the entire apparatus on which the spring is attached is oscillating
     as well. In this case, we are witnessing a `resonance' effect - the frequency of the external
     oscillation matches the frequency of the motion of the object on the spring.16

     y = 2(x + 3) sin  2x  +                              y = 2(x + 3) sin         2x  +  
                              4                                                           4

                                                          y = ±2(x + 3)

3. Last, but not least, we come to x(t) = 5 sin(6t) - 5 sin(8t). To find the period of this function,

     we need to determine the length of the smallest interval on which both f (t) = 5 sin(6t) and

     g(t) = 5 sin(8t) complete a whole number of cycles. To do this, we take the ratio of their

     frequencies and reduce to lowest terms:  6  =  34 .  This tells us that for every 3 cycles f  makes,
                                              8

     g makes 4. In other words, the period of x(t) is three times the period of f (t) (which is

     four times the period of g(t)), or . We graph y = 5 sin(6x) - 5 sin(8x) over [0, ] on the

     calculator to check this. This equation of motion also results from `forced' motion, but here

     the frequency of the external oscillation is different than that of the object on the spring.

     Since the sinusoids here have different frequencies, they are `out of sync' and do not amplify

     each other as in the previous example. Taking things a step further, we can use a sum to

     product identity to rewrite x(t) = 5 sin(6t) - 5 sin(8t) as x(t) = -10 sin(t) cos(7t). The lower

     frequency factor in this expression, -10 sin(t), plays an interesting role in the graph of x(t).

     Below we graph y = 5 sin(6x) - 5 sin(8x) and y = ±10 sin(x) over [0, 2]. This is an example

   1. The sounds we hear are made up of mechanical waves. The note `A' above the note `middle
       C' is a sound wave with ordinary frequency f = 440 Hertz = 440 second cycles . Find a sinusoid which
       models this note, assuming that the amplitude is 1 and the phase shift is 0.

       f = 60 Hertz. Find a sinusoid which models this voltage. Assume that the phase is 0.

3. The London Eye is a popular tourist attraction in London, England and is one of the largest
   Ferris Wheels in the world. It has a diameter of 135 meters and makes one revolution (counter-
   clockwise) every 30 minutes. It is constructed so that the lowest part of the Eye reaches ground
   level, enabling passengers to simply walk on to, and off of, the ride. Find a sinsuoid which
   models the height h of the passenger above the ground in meters t minutes after they board
   the Eye at ground level.

4. On page 732 in Section 10.2.1, we found the x-coordinate of counter-clockwise motion on a
   circle of radius r with angular frequency  to be x = r cos(t), where t = 0 corresponds to
   the point (r, 0). Suppose we are in the situation of Exercise 3 above. Find a sinsusoid which
   models the horizontal displacement x of the passenger from the center of the Eye in meters
   t minutes after they board the Eye. Here we take x(t) > 0 to mean the passenger is to the
   right of the center, while x(t) < 0 means the passenger is to the left of the center.

5. In Exercise 52 in Section 10.1, we introduced the yo-yo trick `Around the World' in which
   a yo-yo is thrown so it sweeps out a vertical circle. As in that exercise, suppose the yo-yo
   string is 28 inches and it completes one revolution in 3 seconds. If the closest the yo-yo ever
   gets to the ground is 2 inches, find a sinsuoid which models the height h of the yo-yo above
   the ground in inches t seconds after it leaves its lowest point.

7. Consider the pendulum below. Ignoring air resistance, the angular displacement of the pen-
   dulum from the vertical position, , can be modeled as a sinusoid.18

                                                      

     The amplitude of the sinusoid is the same as the initial angular displacement, 0, of the
     pendulum and the period of the motion is given by

                                          T = 2 l
                                                      g

     where l is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

          things so (0) = 0.

     Seth-Thomas  clock  to  ensure  the  period  of  the  pendulum  is  1  of  a  second.  Assuming  the
                                                                         2
     initial displacement of the pendulum is 15, find a sinusoid which models the displace-

     ment of the pendulum  as a function of time, t, in seconds.

11.2 The Law of Sines

Trigonometry literally means `measuring triangles' and with Chapter 10 under our belts, we are
more than prepared to do just that. The main goal of this section and the next is to develop
theorems which allow us to `solve' triangles - that is, find the length of each side of a triangle
and the measure of each of its angles. In Sections 10.2, 10.3 and 10.6, we've had some experience
solving right triangles. The following example reviews what we know.

Example 11.2.1. Given a right triangle with a hypotenuse of length 7 units and one leg of length
4 units, find the length of the remaining side and the measures of the remaining angles. Express
the angles in decimal degrees, rounded to the nearest hundreth of a degree.
Solution. For definitiveness, we label the triangle below.

                                             c=7          
                                                                a

                                                   

                                             b=4

To find the length of the missing side a, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to get a2 + 42 = 72
which then yields a = 33 units. Now that all three sides of the triangle are known, there are

several ways we can find  using the inverse trigonometric functions. To decrease the chances of

propagating error, however, we stick to using the data given to us in the problem. In this case, the

lengths 4 and 7 were given, so we want to relate these to . According to Theorem 10.4, cos() = 47 .
                                         4  radians. Converting to degrees, we find   55.15. Now
Since  is an acute angle,  = arccos      7

that we have the measure of angle , we could find the measure of angle  using the fact that 

and  are complements so  +  = 90. Once again, we opt to use the data given to us in the

problem.  According  to  Theorem  10.4,  we  have  that  sin()     =  4  so    =  arcsin  4  radians and we
                                                                      7                   7
have   34.85.

A few remarks about Example 11.2.1 are in order. First, we adhere to the convention that a lower
case Greek letter denotes an angle1 and the corresponding lowercase English letter represents the
side2 opposite that angle. Thus, a is the side opposite , b is the side opposite  and c is the side
opposite . Taken together, the pairs (, a), (, b) and (, c) are called angle-side opposite pairs.
Second, as mentioned earlier, we will strive to solve for quantities using the original data given in
the problem whenever possible. While this is not always the easiest or fastest way to proceed, it

    1as well as the measure of said angle
    2as well as the length of said side
11.2 The Law of Sines                                                                                    897

minimizes the chances of propagated error.3 Third, since many of the applications which require
solving triangles `in the wild' rely on degree measure, we shall adopt this convention for the time
being.4 The Pythagorean Theorem along with Theorems 10.4 and 10.10 allow us to easily handle
any given right triangle problem, but what if the triangle isn't a right triangle? In certain cases,
we can use the Law of Sines to help.

 Theorem 11.2. The Law of Sines: Given a triangle with angle-side opposite pairs (, a),
 (, b) and (, c), the following ratios hold

                                       sin() = sin() = sin()
                                       a           b          c

or, equivalently,

                                          a=b=c
                                       sin() sin() sin()

The proof of the Law of Sines can be broken into three cases. For our first case, consider the

triangle ABC below, all of whose angles are acute, with angle-side opposite pairs (, a), (, b)

and (, c). If we drop an altitude from vertex B, we divide the triangle into two right triangles:

ABQ and BCQ. If we call the length of the altitude h (for height), we get from Theorem 10.4

that  sin() =  h  and  sin() =  h  so  that  h = c sin() = a sin().     After  some  rearrangement   of  the
               c                a
last equation, we get a sin() = c sin() . If we drop an altitude from vertex A, we can proceed as above
using the triangles ABQ and ACQ to get b sin() = c sin() , completing the proof for this case.
                   B                                    B                                  B

         c                a                  c             ha                              Q
                                                                                  c
                                                           
                                                                                         h
                                                                                                   

A b CA                                                  Q CA b C

For our next case consider the triangle ABC below with obtuse angle . Extending an altitude

from vertex A gives two right triangles, as in the previous case: ABQ and            ACQ. Proceeding
as before, we get h = b sin() and h = c sin() so that b sin() = c sin() .

Dropping an altitude from vertex B also generates two right triangles, ABQ and BCQ. We

know that sin( ) =  h  so that h  = c sin( ).  Since   = 180 - , sin( ) = sin(), so in fact,
                    c

we have h = c sin(). Proceeding to  BCQ, we get sin() =  h  so h  = a sin().  Putting this
                                                         a
together with the previous equation, we get c sin() = a sin() , and we are finished with this case.

The remaining case is when ABC is a right triangle. In this case, the Law of Sines reduces to
the formulas given in Theorem 10.4 and is left to the reader. In order to use the Law of Sines to
solve a triangle, we need at least one angle-side opposite pair. The next example showcases some
of the power, and the pitfalls, of the Law of Sines.

1.  = 120, a = 7 units,  = 45                  2.  = 85,  = 30, c = 5.25 units

3.  = 30, a = 1 units, c = 4 units             4.  = 30, a = 2 units, c = 4 units

5.  = 30, a = 3 units, c = 4 units             6.  = 30, a = 4 units, c = 4 units

Solution.

   1. Knowing an angle-side opposite pair, namely  and a, we may proceed in using the Law of
       Sines. Since  = 45, we use sin(45) b = sin(120) 7 so b = sin(120) 7 sin(45) = 3 7 6  5.72 units. Now that
       we have two angle-side pairs, it is time to find the third. To find , we use the fact that the
       sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180. Hence,  = 180 - 120 - 45 = 15.
       To find c, we have no choice but to used the derived value  = 15, yet we can minimize the
       propagation of error here by using the given angle-side opposite pair (, a). The Law of Sines
       gives us sin(15) c = sin(120) 7 so that c = sin(120) 7 sin(15)  2.09 units.5

   2. In this example, we are not immediately given an angle-side opposite pair, but as we have
       the measures of  and , we can solve for  since  = 180 - 85 - 30 = 65. As in the
       previous example, we are forced to use a derived value in our computations since the only

    5The exact value of sin(15) could be found using the difference identity for sine or a half-angle formula, but that
                                                                                                                 7 sin(15)

becomes unnecessarily messy for the discussion at hand. Thus "exact" here means sin(120) .
11.2 The Law of Sines                                                                                                 899

angle-side   pair  available  is  (, c).  The  Law  of  Sines  gives      a        =    sin(65) 5.25 .  After    the  usual
                                                                      sin(85)

rearrangement, we get a = sin(65) 5.25 sin(85)  5.77 units. To find b we use the angle-side pair (, c)

which yields sin(30) b = sin(65) 5.25 hence b = sin(65) 5.25 sin(30)  2.90 units.

                                                                          = 30

                                                               c = 5.25                                 a  5.77

        c  2.09     = 120             = 15                                = 85                = 65

3. Since we are given (, a) and c, we use the Law of Sines to find the measure of . We start
   with 4 sin() = 1 sin(30) and get sin() = 4 sin (30) = 2. Since the range of the sine function is
   [-1, 1], there is no real number with sin() = 2. Geometrically, we see that side a is just too

   short to make a triangle. The next three examples keep the same values for the measure of

    and the length of c while varying the length of a. We will discuss this case in more detail

   after we see what happens in those examples.

4. In this case, we have the measure of  = 30, a = 2 and c = 4. Using the Law of Sines,
   we get 4 sin() = 2 sin(30) so sin() = 2 sin (30) = 1. Now  is an angle in a triangle which
   also contains  = 30. This means that  must measure between 0 and 150 in order

to fit inside the triangle with . The only angle that satisfies this requirement and has

sin() = 1 is  = 90. In other words, we have a right triangle. We find the measure of 

to  be    =  180   - 30  -    90  =  60   and  then     determine  b  using        the  Law  of         Sines.   We find
    2 sin(60)      
b = sin(30) = 2 3  3.46 units. In this case, the side a is precisely long enough to form a
unique right triangle.

                 c=4                      a=1

                                                                         c=4                  = 60 a = 2

5. Proceeding as we have in the previous two examples, we use the Law of Sines to find . In this
   case, we have 4 sin() = 3 sin(30) or sin() = 3 4 sin(30) = 32 . Since  lies in a triangle with  = 30,
900                                                                                Applications of Trigonometry

     we must have that 0 <  < 150. There are two angles  that fall in this range and have

     sin() = 23 :  = arcsin                2  radians  41.81 and  =  - arcsin                     2     radians  138.19. At

     this point, we pause to see if it makes sense that we actually have two viable cases to consider.

     As we have discussed, both candidates for  are `compatible' with the given angle-side pair

     (, a) = (30, 3) in that both choices for  can fit in a triangle with  and both have a sine of

     23 . The only other given piece of information is that c = 4 units. Since c > a, it must be true
     that , which is opposite c, has greater measure than  which is opposite a. In both cases,

      > , so both candidates for  are compatible with this last piece of given information as

     well. Thus have two triangles on our hands. In the case  = arcsin                               2  radians  41.81, we
                                                                                                     3
     find6   180 - 30 - 41.81 = 108.19. Using the Law of Sines with the angle-side opposite
     pair (, a) and , we find b  sin(30) 3 sin(108.19)  5.70 units. In the case  =  - arcsin 32 radians

      138.19, we repeat the exact same steps and find   11.81 and b  1.23 units.7 Both

     triangles are drawn below.

                                                                                                             11.81

                       c=4              108.19                 a=3                                c=4

                           = 30                      41.81                      = 30                            a=3
                                                                                       b  1.23            138.19

                                      b  5.70

6. For this last problem, we repeat the usual Law of Sines routine to find that 4 sin() = 4 sin(30) so
   that sin() = 12 . Since  must inhabit a triangle with  = 30, we must have 0 <  < 150.
   Since the measure of  must be strictly less than 150, there is just one angle which satisfies
   both required conditions, namely  = 30. So  = 180 - 30 - 30 = 120 and, using the

                                                               4 sin(120)

   Law of Sines one last time, b = sin(30) = 4 3  6.93 units.

                                              c=4               = 120                        a=4

                                                 = 30                               = 30

                                                                      b  6.93

Some remarks about Example 11.2.2 are in order. We first note that if we are given the measures
of two of the angles in a triangle, say  and , the measure of the third angle  is uniquely

6To      find  an  exact  expression  for  ,  we   convert  everything  back   to  radians:    = 30  =     radians,    = arcsin  2
                                                                                                        6                        3
               180                                                   2     5             2   radians  108.19.
radians  and        =     radians.  Hence,      =    -  6  - arcsin  3  =   6  - arcsin  3

7An exact answer for  in this case is  = arcsin             2  -        radians   11.81.

determined using the equation  = 180 -  - . Knowing the measures of all three angles of a
triangle completely determines its shape. If in addition we are given the length of one of the sides
of the triangle, we can then use the Law of Sines to find the lengths of the remaining two sides
to determine the size of the triangle. Such is the case in numbers 1 and 2 above. In number 1,
the given side is adjacent to just one of the angles - this is called the `Angle-Angle-Side' (AAS)
case.8 In number 2, the given side is adjacent to both angles which means we are in the so-called
`Angle-Side-Angle' (ASA) case. If, on the other hand, we are given the measure of just one of the
angles in the triangle along with the length of two sides, only one of which is adjacent to the given
angle, we are in the `Angle-Side-Side' (ASS) case.9 In number 3, the length of the one given side a
was too short to even form a triangle; in number 4, the length of a was just long enough to form a
right triangle; in 5, a was long enough, but not too long, so that two triangles were possible; and
in number 6, side a was long enough to form a triangle but too long to swing back and form two.
These four cases exemplify all of the possibilities in the Angle-Side-Side case which are summarized
in the following theorem.

 Theorem 11.3. Suppose (, a) and (, c) are intended to be angle-side pairs in a triangle where
 , a and c are given. Let h = c sin()

       If a < h, then no triangle exists which satisfies the given criteria.

       If a = h, then  = 90 so exactly one (right) triangle exists which satisfies the criteria.

       If h < a < c, then two distinct triangles exist which satisfy the given criteria.

       If a  c, then  is acute and exactly one triangle exists which satisfies the given criteria

Theorem 11.3 is proved on a case-by-case basis. If a < h, then a < c sin(). If a triangle were
to exist, the Law of Sines would have c sin() = a sin() so that sin() = a c sin() > aa = 1, which is
impossible. In the figure below, we see geometrically why this is the case.

  ca                                       c
                            h = c sin()                           a = h = c sin()

                                         

a < h, no triangle                       a = h,  = 90

Simply put, if a < h the side a is too short to connect to form a triangle. This means if a  h,
we are always guaranteed to have at least one triangle, and the remaining parts of the theorem

    8If this sounds familiar, it should. From high school Geometry, we know there are four congruence conditions for
triangles: Angle-Angle-Side (AAS), Angle-Side-Angle (ASA), Side-Angle-Side (SAS) and Side-Side-Side (SSS). If we
are given information about a triangle that meets one of these four criteria, then we are guaranteed that exactly one
triangle exists which satisfies the given criteria.

    9In more reputable books, this is called the `Side-Side-Angle' or SSA case.
902                                                         Applications of Trigonometry

tell us what kind and how many triangles to expect in each case. If a = h, then a = c sin() and
the Law of Sines gives a sin() = c sin() so that sin() = a c sin() = aa = 1. Here,  = 90 as required.
Moving along, now suppose h < a < c. As before, the Law of Sines10 gives sin() = a c sin() . Since
h < a, c sin() < a or a c sin() < 1 which means there are two solutions to sin() = a c sin() : an
acute angle which we'll call 0, and its supplement, 180 - 0. We need to argue that each of
these angles `fit' into a triangle with . Since (, a) and (0, c) are angle-side opposite pairs, the
assumption c > a in this case gives us 0 > . Since 0 is acute, we must have that  is acute as
well. This means one triangle can contain both  and 0, giving us one of the triangles promised in
the theorem. If we manipulate the inequality 0 >  a bit, we have 180 - 0 < 180 -  which gives
(180 - 0) +  < 180. This proves a triangle can contain both of the angles  and (180 - 0),
giving us the second triangle predicted in the theorem. To prove the last case in the theorem, we
assume a  c. Then   , which forces  to be an acute angle. Hence, we get only one triangle
in this case, completing the proof.

One last comment before we use the Law of Sines to solve an application problem. In the Angle-
Side-Side case, if you are given an obtuse angle to begin with then it is impossible to have the two
triangle case. Think about this before reading further.

Example 11.2.3. Sasquatch Island lies off the coast of Ippizuti Lake. Two sightings, taken 5 miles
apart, are made to the island. The angle between the shore and the island at the first observation
point is 30 and at the second point the angle is 45. Assuming a straight coastline, find the
distance from the second observation point to the island. What point on the shore is closest to the
island? How far is the island from this point?

Solution. We sketch the problem below with the first observation point labeled as P and the

second as Q. In order to use the Law of Sines to find the distance d from Q to the island, we first

need to find the measure of  which is the angle opposite the side of length 5 miles. To that end,

we note that the angles  and 45 are supplemental, so that  = 180 - 45 = 135. We can now

find    =  180 - 30 -   =  180 - 30 - 135  =  15.  By  the  Law          of  Sines,  we  have      d    =      5
                                                                                               sin(30)     sin(15)

which gives d = sin(15) 5 sin(30)  9.66 miles. Next, to find the point on the coast closest to the island,

which we've labeled as C, we need to find the perpendicular distance from the island to the coast.11

10Remember, we have already argued that a triangle exists in this case!
11Do you see why C must lie to the right of Q?
11.2 The Law of Sines                                                                          903

Let x denote the distance from the second observation point Q to the point C and let y denote the

distance from C to the island. Using Theorem 10.4, we get sin (45) = dy . After some rearranging,
                                  
                                   2
we find y = d sin (45)  9.66      2    6.83 miles. Hence, the island is approximately 6.83 miles

from the coast. To find the distance from Q to C, we note that  = 180 - 90 - 45 = 45 so

by symmetry,12 we get x = y  6.83 miles. Hence, the point on the shore closest to the island is

approximately 6.83 miles down the coast from the second observation point.

We close this section with a new formula to compute the area enclosed by a triangle. Its proof uses
the same cases and diagrams as the proof of the Law of Sines and is left as an exercise.

Theorem 11.4. Suppose (, a), (, b) and (, c) are the angle-side opposite pairs of a triangle.
Then the area A enclosed by the triangle is given by

                           A = 1 bc sin() = 1 ac sin() = 1 ab sin()

Example 11.2.4. Find the area of the triangle in Example 11.2.2 number 1.

Solution. From our work in Example 11.2.2 number 1, we have all three angles and all three sides

to work with.  However, to minimize propagated error, we choose A =  1   ac  sin(  )  from  Theorem
                                                                     2
11.4 because it uses the most pieces of given information. We are given a = 7 and  = 45, and we

calculated c = sin(120) 7 sin(15) . Using these values, we find A = 21 (7) sin(120) 7 sin(15) sin (45) = 5.18 square

units. The reader is encouraged to check this answer against the results obtained using the other

formulas in Theorem 11.4.

In Exercises 1 - 20, solve for the remaining side(s) and angle(s) if possible. As in the text, (, a),
(, b) and (, c) are angle-side opposite pairs.

  21. Find the area of the triangles given in Exercises 1, 12 and 20 above.

(Another Classic Application: Grade of a Road) The grade of a road is much like the pitch of a
roof (See Example 10.6.6) in that it expresses the ratio of rise/run. In the case of a road, this ratio
is always positive because it is measured going uphill and it is usually given as a percentage. For
example, a road which rises 7 feet for every 100 feet of (horizontal) forward progress is said to have
a 7% grade. However, if we want to apply any Trigonometry to a story problem involving roads
going uphill or downhill, we need to view the grade as an angle with respect to the horizontal. In
Exercises 22 - 24, we first have you change road grades into angles and then use the Law of Sines
in an application.

  22. Using a right triangle with a horizontal leg of length 100 and vertical leg with length 7,
       show that a 7% grade means that the road (hypotenuse) makes about a 4 angle with the
       horizontal. (It will not be exactly 4, but it's pretty close.)

  23. What grade is given by a 9.65 angle made by the road and the horizontal?13

  13I have friends who live in Pacifica, CA and their road is actually this steep. It's not a nice road to drive.
11.2 The Law of Sines                                                                           905

24. Along a long, straight stretch of mountain road with a 7% grade, you see a tall tree standing
     perfectly plumb alongside the road.14 From a point 500 feet downhill from the tree, the angle
     of inclination from the road to the top of the tree is 6. Use the Law of Sines to find the
     height of the tree. (Hint: First show that the tree makes a 94 angle with the road.)

(Another Classic Application: Bearings) In the next several exercises we introduce and work with

the navigation tool known as bearings. Simply put, a bearing is the direction you are heading

according to a compass. The classic nomenclature for bearings, however, is not given as an angle in

standard position, so we must first understand the notation. A bearing is given as an acute angle

of rotation (to the east or to the west) away from the north-south (up and down) line of a compass
rose. For example, N40E (read "40 east of north") is a bearing which is rotated clockwise 40

from due north. If we imagine standing at the origin in the Cartesian Plane, this bearing would
have us heading into Quadrant I along the terminal side of  = 50. Similarly, S50W would point
into Quadrant III along the terminal side of  = 220 because we started out pointing due south
(along  = 270) and rotated clockwise 50 back to 220. Counter-clockwise rotations would be
found in the bearings N60W (which is on the terminal side of  = 150) and S27E (which lies
along the terminal side of  = 297). These four bearings are drawn in the plane below.

                       N60W           N
                                                N40E

                                 60 40

                       W                              E

                       S50W      50 27

                                            S27E
                                     S

The cardinal directions north, south, east and west are usually not given as bearings in the fashion
described above, but rather, one just refers to them as `due north', `due south', `due east' and `due
west', respectively, and it is assumed that you know which quadrantal angle goes with each cardinal
direction. (Hint: Look at the diagram above.)

25. Find the angle  in standard position with 0   < 360 which corresponds to each of the
     bearings given below.

(a) due west           (b) S83E  (c) N5.5E                                       (d) due south

14The word `plumb' here means that the tree is perpendicular to the horizontal.

26. The Colonel spots a campfire at a of bearing N42E from his current position. Sarge, who
     is positioned 3000 feet due east of the Colonel, reckons the bearing to the fire to be N20W
     from his current position. Determine the distance from the campfire to each man, rounded
     to the nearest foot.

27. A hiker starts walking due west from Sasquatch Point and gets to the Chupacabra Trailhead
     before she realizes that she hasn't reset her pedometer. From the Chupacabra Trailhead she
     hikes for 5 miles along a bearing of N53W which brings her to the Muffin Ridge Observatory.
     From there, she knows a bearing of S65E will take her straight back to Sasquatch Point.
     How far will she have to walk to get from the Muffin Ridge Observatory to Sasquach Point?
     What is the distance between Sasquatch Point and the Chupacabra Trailhead?

28. The captain of the SS Bigfoot sees a signal flare at a bearing of N15E from her current
     location. From his position, the captain of the HMS Sasquatch finds the signal flare to be at
     a bearing of N75W. If the SS Bigfoot is 5 miles from the HMS Sasquatch and the bearing
     from the SS Bigfoot to the HMS Sasquatch is N50E, find the distances from the flare to each
     vessel, rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile.

29. Carl spies a potential Sasquatch nest at a bearing of N10E and radios Jeff, who is at a bearing
     of N50E from Carl's position. From Jeff's position, the nest is at a bearing of S70W. If Jeff
     and Carl are 500 feet apart, how far is Jeff from the Sasquatch nest? Round your answer to
     the nearest foot.

30. A hiker determines the bearing to a lodge from her current position is S40W. She proceeds
     to hike 2 miles at a bearing of S20E at which point she determines the bearing to the lodge
     is S75W. How far is she from the lodge at this point? Round your answer to the nearest
     hundredth of a mile.

31. A watchtower spots a ship off shore at a bearing of N70E. A second tower, which is 50 miles
     from the first at a bearing of S80E from the first tower, determines the bearing to the ship
     to be N25W. How far is the boat from the second tower? Round your answer to the nearest
     tenth of a mile.

32. Skippy and Sally decide to hunt UFOs. One night, they position themselves 2 miles apart on
     an abandoned stretch of desert runway. An hour into their investigation, Skippy spies a UFO
     hovering over a spot on the runway directly between him and Sally. He records the angle of
     inclination from the ground to the craft to be 75 and radios Sally immediately to find the
     angle of inclination from her position to the craft is 50. How high off the ground is the UFO
     at this point? Round your answer to the nearest foot. (Recall: 1 mile is 5280 feet.)

15See Example 10.1.1 in Section 10.1 for a review of the DMS system.

33. The angle of depression from an observer in an apartment complex to a gargoyle on the
     building next door is 55. From a point five stories below the original observer, the angle of
     inclination to the gargoyle is 20. Find the distance from each observer to the gargoyle and
     the distance from the gargoyle to the apartment complex. Round your answers to the nearest
     foot. (Use the rule of thumb that one story of a building is 9 feet.)

34. Prove that the Law of Sines holds when ABC is a right triangle.

35. Discuss with your classmates why knowing only the three angles of a triangle is not enough
     to determine any of the sides.

36. Discuss with your classmates why the Law of Sines cannot be used to find the angles in the
     triangle when only the three sides are given. Also discuss what happens if only two sides and
     the angle between them are given. (Said another way, explain why the Law of Sines cannot
     be used in the SSS and SAS cases.)

37. Given  = 30 and b = 10, choose four different values for a so that

      (a) the information yields no triangle
      (b) the information yields exactly one right triangle
      (c) the information yields two distinct triangles
      (d) the information yields exactly one obtuse triangle

     Explain why you cannot choose a in such a way as to have  = 30, b = 10 and your choice
     of a yield only one triangle where that unique triangle has three acute angles.

38. Use the cases and diagrams in the proof of the Law of Sines (Theorem 11.2) to prove the
     area formulas given in Theorem 11.4. Why do those formulas yield square units when four
     quantities are being multiplied together?

11.3 The Law of Cosines

In Section 11.2, we developed the Law of Sines (Theorem 11.2) to enable us to solve triangles in
the `Angle-Angle-Side' (AAS), the `Angle-Side-Angle' (ASA) and the ambiguous `Angle-Side-Side'
(ASS) cases. In this section, we develop the Law of Cosines which handles solving triangles in the
`Side-Angle-Side' (SAS) and `Side-Side-Side' (SSS) cases.1 We state and prove the theorem below.

 Theorem 11.5. Law of Cosines: Given a triangle with angle-side opposite pairs (, a), (, b)
 and (, c), the following equations hold

        a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos() b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos()  c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos()
or, solving for the cosine in each equation, we have

     cos() = b2 + c2 - a2   cos() = a2 + c2 - b2           cos() = a2 + b2 - c2
                       2bc                    2ac                            2ab

To prove the theorem, we consider a generic triangle with the vertex of angle  at the origin with
side b positioned along the positive x-axis.

                            B = (c cos(), c sin())

                                        c                  a
                                                           C = (b, 0)
                            

                            A = (0, 0)             b

From this set-up, we immediately find that the coordinates of A and C are A(0, 0) and C(b, 0).
From Theorem 10.3, we know that since the point B(x, y) lies on a circle of radius c, the coordinates

    1Here, `Side-Angle-Side' means that we are given two sides and the `included' angle - that is, the given angle is
adjacent to both of the given sides.
11.3 The Law of Cosines                                                                                         911

of B are B(x, y) = B(c cos(), c sin()). (This would be true even if  were an obtuse or right angle
so although we have drawn the case when  is acute, the following computations hold for any angle
 drawn in standard position where 0 <  < 180.) We note that the distance between the points
B and C is none other than the length of side a. Using the distance formula, Equation 1.1, we get

           a = (c cos() - b)2 + (c sin() - 0)2

           a2 =                                                    2

                 (c cos() - b)2 + c2 sin2()

           a2 = (c cos() - b)2 + c2 sin2()

           a2 = c2 cos2() - 2bc cos() + b2 + c2 sin2()

           a2 = c2 cos2() + sin2() + b2 - 2bc cos()

           a2 = c2(1) + b2 - 2bc cos()                                Since cos2() + sin2() = 1

           a2 = c2 + b2 - 2bc cos()

The remaining formulas given in Theorem 11.5 can be shown by simply reorienting the triangle
to place a different vertex at the origin. We leave these details to the reader. What's important
about a and  in the above proof is that (, a) is an angle-side opposite pair and b and c are the
sides adjacent to  - the same can be said of any other angle-side opposite pair in the triangle.
Notice that the proof of the Law of Cosines relies on the distance formula which has its roots in the
Pythagorean Theorem. That being said, the Law of Cosines can be thought of as a generalization
of the Pythagorean Theorem. If we have a triangle in which  = 90, then cos() = cos (90) = 0
so we get the familiar relationship c2 = a2 + b2. What this means is that in the larger mathematical
sense, the Law of Cosines and the Pythagorean Theorem amount to pretty much the same thing.2

Example 11.3.1. Solve the following triangles. Give exact answers and decimal approximations
(rounded to hundredths) and sketch the triangle.

1.  = 50, a = 7 units, c = 2 units                                    2. a = 4 units, b = 7 units, c = 5 units

Solution.

   1. We are given the lengths of two sides, a = 7 and c = 2, and the measure of the included
       angle,  = 50. With no angle-side opposite pair to use, we apply the Law of Cosines. We
       get b2 = 72 + 22 - 2(7)(2) cos (50) which yields b = 53 - 28 cos (50)  5.92 units. In
       order to determine the measures of the remaining angles  and , we are forced to used the
       derived value for b. There are two ways to proceed at this point. We could use the Law of
       Cosines again, or, since we have the angle-side opposite pair (, b) we could use the Law of
       Sines. The advantage to using the Law of Cosines over the Law of Sines in cases like this
       is that unlike the sine function, the cosine function distinguishes between acute and obtuse
       angles. The cosine of an acute is positive, whereas the cosine of an obtuse angle is negative.
       Since the sine of both acute and obtuse angles are positive, the sine of an angle alone is not

    2This shouldn't come as too much of a shock. All of the theorems in Trigonometry can ultimately be traced back
to the definition of the circular functions along with the distance formula and hence, the Pythagorean Theorem.

     enough to determine if the angle in question is acute or obtuse. Since both authors of the

     textbook prefer the Law of Cosines, we proceed with this method first. When using the Law

     of Cosines, it's always best to find the measure of the largest unknown angle first, since this

     will give us the obtuse angle of the triangle if there is one. Since the largest angle is opposite
     the longest side, we choose to find  first. To that end, we use the formula cos() = 2bc b2+c2-a2
     and substitute a = 7, b = 53 - 28 cos (50) and c = 2. We get3

                cos() =  2 - 7 cos (50)
                         53 - 28 cos (50)

     Since  is an angle in a triangle, we know the radian measure of  must lie between 0 and 
     radians. This matches the range of the arccosine function, so we have

      = arccos  2 - 7 cos (50)    radians  114.99
                53 - 28 cos (50)

     At this point, we could find  using  = 180 -  -   180 - 114.99 - 50 = 15.01,
     that is if we trust our approximation for . To minimize propagation of error, however, we
     could use the Law of Cosines again,4 in this case using cos() = 2ab a2+b2-c2 . Plugging in a = 7,
     b = 53 - 28 cos (50) and c = 2, we get  = arccos   7-2 cos(50) radians  15.01. We

                                                                                                           53-28 cos(50 )

     sketch the triangle below.

           = 50          a=7

     c=2          114.99   15.01
                              b  5.92

    As we mentioned earlier, once we've determined b it is possible to use the Law of Sines to
    find the remaining angles. Here, however, we must proceed with caution as we are in the
    ambiguous (ASS) case. It is advisable to first find the smallest of the unknown angles, since
    we are guaranteed it will be acute.5 In this case, we would find  since the side opposite 
    is smaller than the side opposite the other unknown angle, . Using the angle-side opposite
    pair (, b), we get 2 sin() = 53-28 cos(50 sin(50) ) . The usual calculations produces   15.01 and
     = 180 -  -   180 - 50 - 15.01 = 114.99.

2. Since all three sides and no angles are given, we are forced to use the Law of Cosines. Following
    our discussion in the previous problem, we find  first, since it is opposite the longest side,
    b. We get cos() = 2ac a2+c2-b2 = - 51 , so we get  = arccos - 51 radians  101.54. As in

3after simplifying . . .
4Your instructor will let you know which procedure to use. It all boils down to how much you trust your calculator.
5There can only be one obtuse angle in the triangle, and if there is one, it must be the largest.

the previous problem, now that we have obtained an angle-side opposite pair (, b), we could

proceed using the Law of Sines. The Law of Cosines, however, offers us a rare opportunity

to find the remaining angles using only the data given to us in the statement of the problem.

Using this, we get  = arccos  5  radians  44.42 and  = arccos  29  radians  34.05.
                              7                                35

                                            101.54

                              c=5                       a=4

                                   34.05         44.42

                                          b=7

We note that, depending on how many decimal places are carried through successive calculations,
and depending on which approach is used to solve the problem, the approximate answers you
obtain may differ slightly from those the authors obtain in the Examples and the Exercises. A
great example of this is number 2 in Example 11.3.1, where the approximate values we record for
the measures of the angles sum to 180.01, which is geometrically impossible. Next, we have an
application of the Law of Cosines.

Example 11.3.2. A researcher wishes to determine the width of a vernal pond as drawn below.
From a point P , he finds the distance to the eastern-most point of the pond to be 950 feet, while
the distance to the western-most point of the pond from P is 1000 feet. If the angle between the
two lines of sight is 60, find the width of the pond.

                                                                               1000 feet

                                                                      60
                                                    950 feet

                                                                            P

Solution. We are given the lengths of two sides and the measure of an included angle, so we may
apply the Law of Cosines to find the length of the missing side opposite the given angle. Calling
this length w(for width), we get w2 = 9502 + 10002 - 2(950)(1000) cos (60) = 952500 from which
we get w = 952500  976 feet.

In Section 11.2, we used the proof of the Law of Sines to develop Theorem 11.4 as an alternate
formula for the area enclosed by a triangle. In this section, we use the Law of Cosines to derive
another such formula - Heron's Formula.

Theorem 11.6. Heron's Formula: Suppose a, b and c denote the lengths of the three sides

of    a  triangle.  Let  s  be     the  semiperimeter   of  the  triangle,  that  is,  let  s  =  1  (a  +  b  +  c).  Then  the
                                                                                                  2

area A enclosed by the triangle is given by

                                            A = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

We prove Theorem 11.6 using Theorem 11.4. Using the convention that the angle  is opposite the

side  c,  we  have  A  =    1  ab  sin(  )  from  Theorem   11.4.  In  order  to  simplify     computations,           we  start  by
                            2
manipulating the expression for A2.

                            A2 =            1 2 ab sin()
                                            2

                                   = 1 a2b2 sin2()
                                        4

                                   = a2b2 1 - cos2()             since sin2() = 1 - cos2().
                                          4

The Law of Cosines tells us cos() = 2ab a2+b2-c2 , so substituting this into our equation for A2 gives

          A2 = a2b2 1 - cos2()
                       4

              = a2b2 1 - a2 + b2 - c2 2
                         4                  2ab

                       a2b2             a2 + b2 - c2 2

            = 16

            = (c - (a - b))(c + (a - b))((a + b) - c)((a + b) + c)                           difference of squares.
                                                16

            = (b + c - a)(a + c - b)(a + b - c)(a + b + c)
                                           16

            = (b + c - a) · (a + c - b) · (a + b - c) · (a + b + c)

At this stage, we recognize the last factor as the semiperimeter, s = 12 (a + b + c) = 2 a+b+c . To
complete the proof, we note that

                         (s - a) = a + b + c - a = a + b + c - 2a = b + c - a
                                               2                            2                2

Similarly,  we  find  (s - b)  =  a+c-b     and   (s - c)    =   2 a+b-c .  Hence,  we  get
                                     2

                      A2 = (b + c - a) · (a + c - b) · (a + b - c) · (a + b + c)
                                         2                 2                   2             2

                         = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)s

so that A = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) as required.

We close with an example of Heron's Formula.

Example 11.3.3. Find the area enclosed of the triangle in Example 11.3.1 number 2.

Solution.   We  are   given    a  =  4,  b  =  7  and  c  =  5.  Using      these  values,  we  find  s  =  1  (4  +  7  +  5)  =  8,
                                                                                                            2

(s - a) = 8 - 4 = 4, (s - b) = 8 - 7 = 1 and (s - c) = 8- 5 = 3. Using Heron's Formula, we get
A = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = (8)(4)(1)(3) = 96 = 4 6  9.80 square units.

11.4 Polar Coordinates

In Section 1.1, we introduced the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane as a means of
assigning ordered pairs of numbers to points in the plane. We defined the Cartesian coordinate
plane using two number lines - one horizontal and one vertical - which intersect at right angles at a
point we called the `origin'. To plot a point, say P (-3, 4), we start at the origin, travel horizontally
to the left 3 units, then up 4 units. Alternatively, we could start at the origin, travel up 4 units,
then to the left 3 units and arrive at the same location. For the most part, the `motions' of the
Cartesian system (over and up) describe a rectangle, and most points can be thought of as the
corner diagonally across the rectangle from the origin.1 For this reason, the Cartesian coordinates
of a point are often called `rectangular' coordinates. In this section, we introduce a new system for
assigning coordinates to points in the plane - polar coordinates. We start with an origin point,
called the pole, and a ray called the polar axis. We then locate a point P using two coordinates,
(r, ), where r represents a directed distance from the pole2 and  is a measure of rotation from
the polar axis. Roughly speaking, the polar coordinates (r, ) of a point measure `how far out' the
point is from the pole (that's r), and `how far to rotate' from the polar axis, (that's ).

                                                       y

            P (-3, 4)                                               P (r, )

                               -4

For example, if we wished to plot the point P with polar coordinates 4, 56 , we'd start at the pole,
                                                                    5
move  out   along  the  polar  axis        4  units,  then  rotate  6     radians  counter-clockwise.

                                                                                P 4, 56

                                                     = 56

We may also visualize this process by thinking of the rotation first.3 To plot P 4, 56 this way,
            5
we  rotate  6  counter-clockwise              from  the     polar  axis,  then  move     outwards  from  the  pole  4  units.

    1Excluding, of course, the points in which one or both coordinates are 0.
    2We will explain more about this momentarily.
    3As with anything in Mathematics, the more ways you have to look at something, the better. The authors

encourage the reader to take time to think about both approaches to plotting points given in polar coordinates.

Essentially  we    are      locating  a  point   on  the  terminal  side  of  5  which  is  4  units  away     from  the  pole.
                                                                              6

              = 56                                            = 56

If r < 0, we begin by moving in the opposite direction on the polar axis from the pole. For example,

to plot Q    -3.5,          we have
                    4

        r = -3.5                                      = 4    Pole                                     Pole

                                                                                                   4

If  we  interpret  the      angle    first,  we  rotate      radians,  then   move  back    through   the      pole  3.5  units.
                                                          4
Here we are locating a point 3.5 units away from the pole on the terminal side of 54 , not 4 .

                             = 4                                     = 4

                   Pole                                      Pole                                     Pole

                                                                                    Q   -3.5,  
                                                                                               4

As you may have guessed,  < 0 means the rotation away from the polar axis is clockwise instead
of counter-clockwise. Hence, to plot R 3.5, - 34 we have the following.

                            r = 3.5

                   Pole                                      Pole                                     Pole

                                                              = - 34

                                                                                    R 3.5, - 34

From an `angles first' approach, we rotate - 34 then move out 3.5 units from the pole. We see that
R is the point on the terminal side of  = - 34 which is 3.5 units from the pole.

                   Pole                                        Pole                                      Pole

The points Q and R above are, in fact, the same point despite the fact that their polar coordinate
representations are different. Unlike Cartesian coordinates where (a, b) and (c, d) represent the
same point if and only if a = c and b = d, a point can be represented by infinitely many polar
coordinate pairs. We explore this notion more in the following example.

Example 11.4.1. For each point in polar coordinates given below plot the point and then give
two additional expressions for the point, one of which has r > 0 and the other with r < 0.

1. P (2, 240)                 2. P -4, 76                     3. P 117, - 52                   4. P  -3,  -  
                                                                                                             4

Solution.

1. Whether we move 2 units along the polar axis and then rotate 240 or rotate 240 then move
   out 2 units from the pole, we plot P (2, 240) below.

                               = 240

                        Pole                                                    Pole

                                                                    P (2, 240)

We now set about finding alternate descriptions (r, ) for the point P . Since P is 2 units from

the pole, r = ±2. Next, we choose angles  for each of the r values. The given representation
for P is (2, 240) so the angle  we choose for the r = 2 case must be coterminal with 240.
(Can you see why?) One such angle is  = -120 so one answer for this case is (2, -120). For

the case r = -2, we visualize our rotation starting 2 units to the left of the pole. From this
position, we need only to rotate  = 60 to arrive at location coterminal with 240. Hence,
our answer here is (-2, 60). We check our answers by plotting them.

               Pole                                                      = 60            Pole
                     = -120

           P (2, -120)                                                       P (-2, 60)

2. We plot  -4, 76      by  first  moving  4  units  to  the  left  of  the  pole  and   then  rotating  7   radians.
                                                                                                         6
Since r = -4 < 0, we find our point lies 4 units from the pole on the terminal side of 6 .

                                                                                                          P -4, 76

                        Pole                                                       Pole

     To find alternate descriptions for P , we note that the distance from P to the pole is 4 units, so

     any representation (r, ) for P must have r = ±4. As we noted above, P lies on the terminal
     side of 6 , so this, coupled with r = 4, gives us 4, 6 as one of our answers. To find a different
     representation for P with r = -4, we may choose any angle coterminal with the angle in the
     original representation of P -4, 76 . We pick - 56 and get -4, - 56 as our second answer.

                                                P 4, 6                  = - 56    P -4, - 56

3. To plot P 117, - 52 , we move along the polar axis 117 units from the pole and rotate
                5
     clockwise  2  radians  as  illustrated  below.

                   Pole                                                Pole

     Since P is 117 units from the pole, any representation (r, ) for P satisfies r = ±117. For the

     r = 117 case, we can take  to be any angle coterminal with - 52 . In this case, we choose
      = 32 , and get 117, 32 as one answer. For the r = -117 case, we visualize moving left 117
                                                                                                   
     units from the pole and then rotating through an angle         to reach P .  We find that  =  2

     satisfies this requirement, so our second answer is  -117,     .

Now that we have had some practice with plotting points in polar coordinates, it should come as
no surprise that any given point expressed in polar coordinates has infinitely many other represen-
tations in polar coordinates. The following result characterizes when two sets of polar coordinates
determine the same point in the plane. It could be considered as a definition or a theorem, depend-
ing on your point of view. We state it as a property of the polar coordinate system.

                    Equivalent Representations of Points in Polar Coordinates
 Suppose (r, ) and (r ,  ) are polar coordinates where r = 0, r = 0 and the angles are measured
 in radians. Then (r, ) and (r ,  ) determine the same point P if and only if one of the following
 is true:

       r = r and  =  + 2k for some integer k

       r = -r and  =  + (2k + 1) for some integer k

 All polar coordinates of the form (0, ) represent the pole regardless of the value of .

The key to understanding this result, and indeed the whole polar coordinate system, is to keep in
mind that (r, ) means (directed distance from pole, angle of rotation). If r = 0, then no matter
how much rotation is performed, the point never leaves the pole. Thus (0, ) is the pole for all
924                                                           Applications of Trigonometry

values of . Now let's assume that neither r nor r is zero. If (r, ) and (r ,  ) determine the same
point P then the (non-zero) distance from P to the pole in each case must be the same. Since this
distance is controlled by the first coordinate, we have that either r = r or r = -r. If r = r, then
when plotting (r, ) and (r ,  ), the angles  and  have the same initial side. Hence, if (r, ) and
(r ,  ) determine the same point, we must have that  is coterminal with . We know that this
means  =  + 2k for some integer k, as required. If, on the other hand, r = -r, then when
plotting (r, ) and (r ,  ), the initial side of  is rotated  radians away from the initial side of
. In this case,  must be coterminal with  + . Hence,  =  +  + 2k which we rewrite as
 =  + (2k + 1) for some integer k. Conversely, if r = r and  =  + 2k for some integer k, then
the points P (r, ) and P (r ,  ) lie the same (directed) distance from the pole on the terminal sides
of coterminal angles, and hence are the same point. Now suppose r = -r and  =  + (2k + 1)
for some integer k. To plot P , we first move a directed distance r from the pole; to plot P , our
first step is to move the same distance from the pole as P , but in the opposite direction. At this
intermediate stage, we have two points equidistant from the pole rotated exactly  radians apart.
Since  =  + (2k + 1) = ( + ) + 2k for some integer k, we see that  is coterminal to ( + )
and it is this extra  radians of rotation which aligns the points P and P .

Next, we marry the polar coordinate system with the Cartesian (rectangular) coordinate system.
To do so, we identify the pole and polar axis in the polar system to the origin and positive x-axis,
respectively, in the rectangular system. We get the following result.

 Theorem 11.7. Conversion Between Rectangular and Polar Coordinates: Suppose P
 is represented in rectangular coordinates as (x, y) and in polar coordinates as (r, ). Then

      x = r cos() and y = r sin()
      x2 + y2 = r2 and tan() = y (provided x = 0)

                                            x

In the case r > 0, Theorem 11.7 is an immediate consequence of Theorem 10.3 along with the
quotient identity tan() = cos() sin() . If r < 0, then we know an alternate representation for (r, )

is (-r,  + ). Since cos( + ) = - cos() and sin( + ) = - sin(), applying the theorem to

(-r,  + ) gives x = (-r) cos( + ) = (-r)(- cos()) = r cos() and y = (-r) sin( + ) =

(-r)(- sin()) = r sin().  Moreover,  x2 + y2  = (-r)2  = r2,  and  y  = tan( + ) = tan(),  so  the
                                                                   x

theorem is true in this case, too. The remaining case is r = 0, in which case (r, ) = (0, ) is the

pole. Since the pole is identified with the origin (0, 0) in rectangular coordinates, the theorem in

this case amounts to checking `0 = 0.' The following example puts Theorem 11.7 to good use.

Solution.

1. Even though we are not explicitly told to do so, we can avoid many common mistakes by taking
   the time to plot the points before we do any calculations. Plotting P 2, -2 3 shows that
   it lies in Quadrant IV. With x = 2 and y = -23, we get r2 = x2 + y2 = (2)2 + -23 2 =

4 + 12 = 16 so r = ±4. Since we are asked for r  0, we choose r = 4. To find , we have
                   y         -2 3                                                                  3 , and since P
that tan() =       x    =       2     = - 3.     This tells us  has a reference angle of

lies in Quadrant IV, we know  is a Quadrant IV angle. We are asked to have 0   < 2,

so we choose  = 53 . Hence, our answer is 4, 53 . To check, we convert (r, ) = 4, 53
                                                                                                5  = 4 12
back to rectangular coordinates and we find x = r cos() = 4 cos                                 3                = 2 and
                                                                
                             5   = 4 - 32
y = r sin() = 4 sin          3                   = -2           3, as required.

2. The point Q(-3, -3) lies in Quadrant III. Using x = y = -3, we get r2 = (-3)2+ (-3)2 = 18
   so r = ± 18 = ±3 2. Since we are asked for r  0, we choose r = 3 2. We find

tan() =        -3  = 1, which means  has a reference angle of                       4 .  Since Q lies in Quadrant III,
               -3
we choose  = 54 , which satisfies the requirement that 0   < 2. Our final answer is
                5                                                               5  2
(r, ) = 3 2, 4 . To check, we find x = r cos() = (3 2) cos 4 = (3 2) - 2 = -3
                              5  2
and y = r sin() = (3 2) sin 4 = (3 2) - 2 = -3, so we are done.

           P has rectangular coordinates (2, -2 3)                   Q has polar coordinates 3 2, 54

                 P has polar coordinates 4, 53

3. The point R(0, -3) lies along the negative y-axis. While we could go through the usual

computations4 to find the polar form of R, in this case we can find the polar coordinates of R

using the definition. Since the pole is identified with the origin, we can easily tell the point R

is 3 units from the pole, which means in the polar representation (r, ) of R we know r = ±3.

Since      we  require  r    0,  we   choose  r  =  3.          Concerning  ,  the  angle    =  3  satisfies  0             <  2
                                                                                                2

4Since x = 0, we would have to determine  geometrically.

     with its terminal side along the negative y-axis, so our answer is 3, 32 . To check, we note
                               3                                                     3
     x = r cos() = 3 cos       2      = (3)(0) = 0 and y = r sin() = 3 sin           2     = 3(-1) = -3.

4. The point S(-3, 4) lies in Quadrant II. With x = -3 and y = 4, we get r2 = (-3)2 +(4)2 = 25

     so r = ±5. As usual, we choose r = 5  0 and proceed to determine . We have tan() =

     y  =   4  =  - 43 ,  and  since  this  isn't  the      tangent  of  one  the  common  angles,  we  resort   to  using
     x     -3

     the arctangent function. Since  lies in Quadrant II and must satisfy 0   < 2, we choose

      =  - arctan         4    radians. Hence, our answer is (r, ) =               5,  - arctan  4       (5, 2.21). To

     check our answers requires a bit of tenacity since we need to simplify expressions of the form:

     cos    - arctan      4    and sin       - arctan       4  . These are good review exercises and are hence

     left to the reader. We find cos         - arctan          3                      - arctan      3      =  5  ,  so  that

     x = r cos() = (5) - 35       = -3 and y = r sin() = (5)                  4  = 4 which confirms our answer.

Now that we've had practice converting representations of points between the rectangular and polar
coordinate systems, we now set about converting equations from one system to another. Just as
we've used equations in x and y to represent relations in rectangular coordinates, equations in the
variables r and  represent relations in polar coordinates. We convert equations between the two
systems using Theorem 11.7 as the next example illustrates.

Solution.

1. One strategy to convert an equation from rectangular to polar coordinates is to replace every
   occurrence of x with r cos() and every occurrence of y with r sin() and use identities to
   simplify. This is the technique we employ below.

(a) We start by substituting x = r cos() and y = sin() into (x-3)2+y2 = 9 and simplifying.

     With no real direction in which to proceed, we follow our mathematical instincts and
     see where they take us.5

                                   (r cos() - 3)2 + (r sin())2 = 9

                   r2 cos2() - 6r cos() + 9 + r2 sin2() = 9

                        r2 cos2() + sin2() - 6r cos() = 0 Subtract 9 from both sides.

                                                          r2 - 6r cos() = 0 Since cos2() + sin2() = 1

                                                         r(r - 6 cos()) = 0                                       Factor.

           We get r = 0 or r = 6 cos(). From Section 7.2 we know the equation (x - 3)2 + y2 = 9

           describes a circle, and since r = 0 describes just a point (namely the pole/origin), we
           choose r = 6 cos() for our final answer.6

(b) Substituting x = r cos() and y = r sin() into y = -x gives r sin() = -r cos().

           Rearranging, we get r cos() + r sin() = 0 or r(cos() + sin()) = 0. This gives r = 0 or

           cos() + sin() = 0. Solving the latter equation for , we get  = - 4 + k for integers
           k. As we did in the previous example, we take a step back and think geometrically.

           We know y = -x describes a line through the origin. As before, r = 0 describes the

           origin, but nothing else. Consider the equation  = - 4 . In this equation, the variable
           r is free,7 meaning it can assume any and all values including r = 0. If we imagine

           plotting     points  (  r,  -     )  for  all  conceivable     values   of   r  (positive,   negative  and   zero),  we
                                          4
           are essentially drawing the line containing the terminal side of  = - 4 which is none
           other than y = -x. Hence, we can take as our final answer  = - 4 here.8

(c) We substitute x = r cos() and y = r sin() into y = x2 and get r sin() = (r cos())2, or

           r2 cos2() - r sin() = 0. Factoring, we get r(r cos2() - sin()) = 0 so that either r = 0

           or r cos2() = sin(). We can solve the latter equation for r by dividing both sides of

           the equation by cos2(), but as a general rule, we never divide through by a quantity

           that may be 0. In this particular case, we are safe since if cos2() = 0, then cos() = 0,

           and for the equation r cos2() = sin() to hold, then sin() would also have to be 0.

           Since there are no angles with both cos() = 0 and sin() = 0, we are not losing any

5Experience is the mother of all instinct, and necessity is the mother of invention. Study this example and see

what techniques are employed, then try your best to get your answers in the homework to match Jeff's.

6Note  that  when  we   substitute       =      into  r   = 6 cos(),  we  recover  the  point  r  = 0,  so  we  aren't  losing  anything
                                             2

by disregarding r = 0.

7See Section 8.1.

8We could take it to be any of  = - 4 + k for integers k.
928                                                                                   Applications of Trigonometry

              information by dividing both sides of r cos2() = sin() by cos2(). Doing so, we get
              r = cos2() sin() , or r = sec() tan(). As before, the r = 0 case is recovered in the solution
              r = sec() tan() (let  = 0), so we state the latter as our final answer.

2. As a general rule, converting equations from polar to rectangular coordinates isn't as straight

       forward as the reverse process. We could solve r2 = x2 + y2 for r to get r = ± x2 + y2

       and    solving       tan()  =      y    requires   the   arctangent       function  to  get     =  arctan     y   + k for

       integers k. Neither of these expressions for r and  are especially user-friendly, so we opt for

       a second strategy - rearrange the given polar equation so that the expressions r2 = x2 + y2,

       r cos()     =    x,   r sin()  =   y   and/or  tan()        =  y  present  themselves.
                                                                      x

          (a) Starting with r = -3, we can square both sides to get r2 = (-3)2 or r2 = 9. We may now

              substitute r2 = x2 + y2 to get the equation x2 + y2 = 9. As we have seen,9 squaring an

              equation does not, in general, produce an equivalent equation. The concern here is that

              the equation r2 = 9 might be satisfied by more points than r = -3. On the surface, this

              appears to be the case since r2 = 9 is equivalent to r = ±3, not just r = -3. However,

              any point with polar coordinates (3, ) can be represented as (-3,  + ), which means

              any point (r, ) whose polar coordinates satisfy the relation r = ±3 has an equivalent10

              representation which satisfies r = -3.                                                                          
                                                                                                                           = 3.
       (b)    We   take      the  tangent      of   both  sides    the   equation     =  4  to  get  tan()  =   tan     4
                                                    y                                    3                              3
                                      y
              Since tan() = x , we get x = 3 or y = x 3. Of course, we pause a moment to wonder
                                                                   4                                                     points.11
              if,  geometrically,         the  equations        =  3     and  y  =  x3   generate    the  same  set  of

              The same argument presented in number 1b applies equally well here so we are done.

          (c) Once again, we need to manipulate r = 1 - cos() a bit before using the conversion

               formulas given in Theorem 11.7. We could square both sides of this equation like we did
               in part 2a above to obtain an r2 on the left hand side, but that does nothing helpful for
               the right hand side. Instead, we multiply both sides by r to obtain r2 = r - r cos().
               We now have an r2 and an r cos() in the equation, which we can easily handle, but
               we also have another r to deal with. Rewriting the equation as r = r2 + r cos()
               and squaring both sides yields r2 = r2 + r cos() 2. Substituting r2 = x2 + y2 and
               r cos() = x gives x2 + y2 = x2 + y2 + x 2. Once again, we have performed some

9Exercise 5.3.1 in Section 5.3, for instance . . .

10Here, `equivalent' means they represent the same point in the plane. As ordered pairs, (3, 0) and (-3, ) are

different, but when interpreted as polar coordinates, they correspond to the same point in the plane. Mathematically

speaking, relations are sets of ordered pairs, so the equations r2 = 9 and r = -3 represent different relations since

they correspond to different sets of ordered pairs. Since polar coordinates were defined geometrically to describe the

location of points in the plane, however, we concern ourselves only with ensuring that the sets of points in the plane

generated by two equations are the same. This was not an issue, by the way, when we first defined relations as sets

of points in the plane in Section 1.2. Back then, a point in the plane was identified with a unique ordered pair given

by its Cartesian coordinates.                                                                                              

11In addition to taking the tangent of both sides of an equation (There are infinitely many solutions to tan() = 3,
and    =  4   is  only  one  of  them!),  we  also  went  from  y  =     3, in which x cannot be 0, to y = x 3 in which we assume
           3                                                    x

x can be 0.

algebraic maneuvers which may have altered the set of points described by the original
equation. First, we multiplied both sides by r. This means that now r = 0 is a viable
solution to the equation. In the original equation, r = 1 - cos(), we see that  = 0 gives
r = 0, so the multiplication by r doesn't introduce any new points. The squaring of
both sides of this equation is also a reason to pause. Are there points with coordinates
(r, ) which satisfy r2 = r2 + r cos() 2 but do not satisfy r = r2 + r cos()? Suppose
(r ,  ) satisfies r2 = r2 + r cos() 2. Then r = ± (r )2 + r cos( ) . If we have that
r = (r )2+r cos( ), we are done. What if r = - (r )2 + r cos( ) = -(r )2-r cos( )?
We claim that the coordinates (-r ,  + ), which determine the same point as (r ,  ),
satisfy r = r2 + r cos(). We substitute r = -r and  =  +  into r = r2 + r cos() to
see if we get a true statement.

                        ?  2
                        -r = (-r ) + (-r cos( + ))

- -(r )2 - r cos( )     ?  (r )2 - r cos( + )       Since r = -(r )2 - r cos( )

                        =

(r )2 + r cos( )        ?  (r )2 - r (- cos( ))     Since cos( + ) = - cos( )

                        =

(r )2 + r cos( ) = (r )2 + r cos( )

Since both sides worked out to be equal, (-r ,  + ) satisfies r = r2 + r cos() which
means that any point (r, ) which satisfies r2 = r2 + r cos() 2 has a representation

which satisfies r = r2 + r cos(), and we are done.

In practice, much of the pedantic verification of the equivalence of equations in Example 11.4.3 is
left unsaid. Indeed, in most textbooks, squaring equations like r = -3 to arrive at r2 = 9 happens
without a second thought. Your instructor will ultimately decide how much, if any, justification is
warranted. If you take anything away from Example 11.4.3, it should be that relatively nice things
in rectangular coordinates, such as y = x2, can turn ugly in polar coordinates, and vice-versa. In the
next section, we devote our attention to graphing equations like the ones given in Example 11.4.3
number 2 on the Cartesian coordinate plane without converting back to rectangular coordinates.
If nothing else, number 2c above shows the price we pay if we insist on always converting to back
to the more familiar rectangular coordinate system.

11.5 Graphs of Polar Equations

In this section, we discuss how to graph equations in polar coordinates on the rectangular coordinate
plane. Since any given point in the plane has infinitely many different representations in polar
coordinates, our `Fundamental Graphing Principle' in this section is not as clean as it was for
graphs of rectangular equations on page 23. We state it below for completeness.

                  The Fundamental Graphing Principle for Polar Equations
The graph of an equation in polar coordinates is the set of points which satisfy the equation.
That is, a point P (r, ) is on the graph of an equation if and only if there is a representation of
P , say (r ,  ), such that r and  satisfy the equation.

Our first example focuses on some of the more structurally simple polar equations.

Example 11.5.1. Graph the following polar equations.

1. r = 4                         3.  = 54                        4.  = - 32
          2. r = -3 2

Solution. In each of these equations, only one of the variables r and  is present making the other
variable free.1 This makes these graphs easier to visualize than others.

1. In the equation r = 4,  is free. The graph of this equation is, therefore, all points which
   have a polar coordinate representation (4, ), for any choice of . Graphically this translates
   into tracing out all of the points 4 units away from the origin. This is exactly the definition
   of circle, centered at the origin, with a radius of 4.

          y                                                   y

                                                          4

             >0

                              x                       -4                            4x

             <0

                                                          -4

          In r = 4,  is free                              The graph of r = 4

                                                                              
2. Once again we have  being free in the equation r = -3 2. Plotting all of the points of the

    form (-3 2, ) gives us a circle of radius 3 2 centered at the origin.

3. In the equation  = 54 , r is free, so we plot all of the points with polar representation r, 54 .
                                                                                                                                           5
What  we  find  is  that  we  are   tracing  out                                 the  line  which  contains  the  terminal  side  of    =  4

          In  = 54 , r is free                                                                         The  graph  of    =  5

4. As in the previous example, the variable r is free in the equation  = - 32 . Plotting r, - 32
   for various values of r shows us that we are tracing out the y-axis.

   In  = - 32 , r is free                                    The graph of  = - 32

Hopefully, our experience in Example 11.5.1 makes the following result clear.

Theorem 11.8. Graphs of Constant r and : Suppose a and  are constants, a = 0.

       The graph of the polar equation r = a on the Cartesian plane is a circle centered at the
         origin of radius |a|.

       The graph of the polar equation  =  on the Cartesian plane is the line containing the
         terminal side of  when plotted in standard position.

Suppose we wish to graph r = 6 cos(). A reasonable way to start is to treat  as the independent
variable, r as the dependent variable, evaluate r = f () at some `friendly' values of  and plot the
resulting points.2 We generate the table below.

 r = 6 cos()          (r, )                                                     y

2For a review of these concepts and this process, see Sections 1.4 and 1.6.
11.5 Graphs of Polar Equations                                                                               941

Despite having nine ordered pairs, we get only four distinct points on the graph. For this reason,
we employ a slightly different strategy. We graph one cycle of r = 6 cos() on the r-plane3 and use
it to help graph the equation on the xy-plane. We see that as  ranges from 0 to 2 , r ranges from 6
to 0. In the xy-plane, this means that the curve starts 6 units from the origin on the positive x-axis
( = 0) and gradually returns to the origin by the time the curve reaches the y-axis ( = 2 ). The
arrows drawn in the figure below are meant to help you visualize this process. In the r-plane, the

arrows are drawn from the -axis to the curve r = 6 cos(). In the xy-plane, each of these arrows

starts at the origin and is rotated through the corresponding angle , in accordance with how we

plot polar coordinates. It is a less-precise way to generate the graph than computing the actual

function values, but it is markedly faster.

                                                                                                          2

Next, we repeat the process as  ranges from     to .       Here, the r values are all negative.           This
                                             2

means that in the xy-plane, instead of graphing in Quadrant II, we graph in Quadrant IV, with all

of the angle rotations starting from the negative x-axis.

                                                             runs  from     to

As  ranges from  to 32 , the r values are still negative, which means the graph is traced out in
Quadrant I instead of Quadrant III. Since the |r| for these values of  match the r values for  in

    3The graph looks exactly like y = 6 cos(x) in the xy-plane, and for good reason. At this stage, we are just graphing
the relationship between r and  before we interpret them as polar coordinates (r, ) on the xy-plane.

0, 2 , we have that the curve begins to retrace itself at this point. Proceeding further, we find
              3
that  when    2             2,    we         retrace  the  portion  of  the  curve  in  Quadrant   IV    that  we                            first  traced

out  as            .  The         reader     is  invited   to  verify  that  plotting  any  range  of    outside                             the    interval
         2
[0, ] results in retracting some portion of the curve.4 We present the final graph below.

                                                                                                        3 6x

              r = 6 cos() in the r-plane

Example 11.5.2. Graph the following polar equations.

1. r = 4 - 2 sin()                           2. r = 2 + 4 cos()         3. r = 5 sin(2)                  4. r2 = 16 cos(2)

Solution.

1. We first plot the fundamental cycle of r = 4 - 2 sin() on the r-axes. To help us visualize
   what is going on graphically, we divide up [0, 2] into the usual four subintervals 0, 2 , 2 ,  ,
     , 32 and 32 , 2 , and proceed as we did above. As  ranges from 0 to 2 , r decreases from
   4 to 2. This means that the curve in the xy-plane starts 4 units from the origin on the positive

   x-axis and gradually pulls in towards the origin as it moves towards the positive y-axis.

                            r                                                                  y

                      6                                                                                  runs  from                          0  to  
                                                                                                                                                    2

                                                                                                                                          x
                      4

                      2

                                  2  32 2 

4The graph of r = 6 cos() looks suspiciously like a circle, for good reason. See number 1a in Example 11.4.3.

Next,  as     runs    from     to  ,   we  see  that  r  increases  from    2   to  4.  Picking   up   where                                   we  left

off, we gradually pull the graph away from the origin until we reach the negative x-axis.

Over the interval , 32 , we see that r increases from 4 to 6. On the xy-plane, the curve
sweeps out away from the origin as it travels from the negative x-axis to the negative y-axis.

                   r                                                                      y

Finally,  as    takes  on   values  from   3    to  2,   r  decreases     from  6   back  to  4.  The  graph                                   on      the

We leave it to the reader to verify that plotting points corresponding to values of  outside
the interval [0, 2] results in retracing portions of the curve, so we are finished.

       r = 4 - 2 sin() in the r-plane

2. The first thing to note when graphing r = 2 + 4 cos() on the r-plane over the interval

[0, 2] is that the graph crosses through the -axis. This corresponds to the graph of the

curve passing through the origin in the xy-plane, and our first task is to determine when this

happens. Setting r = 0 we get 2 + 4 cos() = 0, or cos() = - 12 . Solving for  in [0, 2]
             2                                   43 .
gives    =   3  and                           =         Since  these  values   of    are  important     geometrically,  we       break  the

interval [0, 2] into six subintervals: 0, 2 , 2 , 23 , 23 ,  , , 43 , 34 , 23 and 32 , 2 . As
 ranges from 0 to 2 , r decreases from 6 to 2. Plotting this on the xy-plane, we start 6 units

out from the origin on the positive x-axis and slowly pull in towards the positive y-axis.

On the interval 2 , 32 , r decreases from 2 to 0, which means the graph is heading into (and
will eventually cross through) the origin. Not only do we reach the origin when  = 23 , a

          On the interval 23 ,  , r ranges from 0 to -2. Since r  0, the curve passes through the

          towards the positive x-axis.6 Since |r| is increasing from 0 to 2, the curve pulls away from

          the origin to finish at a point on the positive x-axis.

          Next, as  progresses from  to 43 , r ranges from -2 to 0. Since r  0, we continue our
          graph in the first quadrant, heading into the origin along the line  = 43 .

6Recall that one way to visualize plotting polar coordinates (r, ) with r < 0 is to start the rotation from the left

side  of  the  pole  -  in  this  case,   the   negative  x-axis.  Rotating   between      2   and                radians      from  the  negative  x-axis  in
                                                                                            3

this  case  determines      the   region    between  the  line    =   3  and  the  x-axis  in                   Quadrant  IV.

3. As usual, we start by graphing a fundamental cycle of r = 5 sin(2) in the r-plane, which in

   this case, occurs as  ranges from 0 to . We partition our interval into subintervals to help
   us with the graphing, namely 0, 4 , 4 , 2 , 2 , 43 and 34 ,  . As  ranges from 0 to 4 , r
   increases from 0 to 5. This means that the graph of r = 5 sin(2) in the xy-plane starts at
   the origin and gradually sweeps out so it is 5 units away from the origin on the line  = 4 .

Next, we see that r decreases from 5 to 0 as  runs through 4 , 2 , and furthermore, r is
                                     2 .

As     runs  from                       to  34 ,  r  becomes  negative  and     ranges  from   0  to  -5.  Since  r     0,  the  curve
                                     2

pulls away from the negative y-axis into Quadrant IV.

Even though we have finished with one complete cycle of r = 5 sin(2), if we continue plotting

beyond  = , we find that the curve continues into the third quadrant! Below we present a

graph of a second cycle of r = 5 sin(2) which continues on from the first. The boxed labels

on the -axis correspond to the portions with matching labels on the curve in the xy-plane.

4. Graphing r2 = 16 cos(2) is complicated by the r2, so we solve to get r = ± 16 cos(2) =

   ±4 cos(2). How do we sketch such a curve? First off, we sketch a fundamental period

   of r = cos(2) which we have dotted in the figure below. When cos(2) < 0, cos(2) is
   undefined, so we don't have any values on the interval 4 , 43 . On the intervals which remain,
   cos(2) ranges from 0 to 1, inclusive. Hence, cos(2) ranges from 0 to 1 as well.7 From

   this, we know r = ±4 cos(2) ranges continuously from 0 to ±4, respectively. Below we

   graph both r = 4 cos(2) and r = -4 cos(2) on the r plane and use them to sketch the
   corresponding pieces of the curve r2 = 16 cos(2) in the xy-plane. As we have seen in earlier

    7Owing to the relationship between y = x and y = x over [0, 1], we also know  cos(2)  cos(2) wherever the
former is defined.

A few remarks are in order. First, there is no relation, in general, between the period of the function
f () and the length of the interval required to sketch the complete graph of r = f () in the xy-
plane. As we saw on page 941, despite the fact that the period of f () = 6 cos() is 2, we sketched
the complete graph of r = 6 cos() in the xy-plane just using the values of  as  ranged from 0
to . In Example 11.5.2, number 3, the period of f () = 5 sin(2) is , but in order to obtain the
complete graph of r = 5 sin(2), we needed to run  from 0 to 2. While many of the `common'
polar graphs can be grouped into families,9 the authors truly feel that taking the time to work
through each graph in the manner presented here is the best way to not only understand the polar

    8In this case, we could have generated the entire graph by using just the plot r = 4 cos(2), but graphed over
the interval [0, 2] in the r-plane. We leave the details to the reader.

    9Numbers 1 and 2 in Example 11.5.2 are examples of `limac¸ons,' number 3 is an example of a `polar rose,' and
number 4 is the famous `Lemniscate of Bernoulli.'

coordinate system, but also prepare you for what is needed in Calculus. Second, the symmetry
seen in the examples is also a common occurrence when graphing polar equations. In addition to
the usual kinds of symmetry discussed up to this point in the text (symmetry about each axis and
the origin), it is possible to talk about rotational symmetry. We leave the discussion of symmetry
to the Exercises. In our next example, we are given the task of finding the intersection points of
polar curves. According to the Fundamental Graphing Principle for Polar Equations on page 938,
in order for a point P to be on the graph of a polar equation, it must have a representation P (r, )
which satisfies the equation. What complicates matters in polar coordinates is that any given point
has infinitely many representations. As a result, if a point P is on the graph of two different polar
equations, it is entirely possible that the representation P (r, ) which satisfies one of the equations
does not satisfy the other equation. Here, more than ever, we need to rely on the Geometry as
much as the Algebra to find our solutions.

Example 11.5.3. Find the points of intersection of the graphs of the following polar equations.

1. r = 2 sin() and r = 2 - 2 sin()            2. r = 2 and r = 3 cos()

3. r = 3 and r = 6 cos(2)                     4. r = 3 sin     and r = 3 cos

Solution.

1. Following the procedure in Example 11.5.2, we graph r = 2 sin() and find it to be a circle

   centered at the point with rectangular coordinates (0, 1) with a radius of 1. The graph of
   r = 2 - 2 sin() is a special kind of limac¸on called a `cardioid.'10

     It appears as if there are three intersection points: one in the first quadrant, one in the second
     quadrant, and the origin. Our next task is to find polar representations of these points. In

     order for a point P to be on the graph of r = 2 sin(), it must have a representation P (r, )

     which satisfies r = 2 sin(). If P is also on the graph of r = 2-2 sin(), then P has a (possibly

     different) representation P (r ,  ) which satisfies r = 2 sin( ). We first try to see if we can

     find any points which have a single representation P (r, ) that satisfies both r = 2 sin() and

     r = 2 - 2 sin(). Assuming such a pair (r, ) exists, then equating11 the expressions for r

     gives  2 sin() = 2 - 2 sin()     or  sin() =     12 .  From     this,   we  get    =     + 2k    or     =  5     + 2k
                                                                                           6                    6
                                                                                                  = 2 12
     for integers k.   Plugging       =  6  into r = 2 sin(), we get r = 2 sin                6              = 1, which

     is also the value we obtain when we substitute it into r = 2 - 2 sin(). Hence, 1, 6 is one

     representation for the point of intersection in the first quadrant. For the point of intersection

     in the second quadrant, we try  = 56 . Both equations give us the point 1, 56 , so this is
     our answer here. What about the origin? We know from Section 11.4 that the pole may be

     represented as (0, ) for any angle . On the graph of r = 2 sin(), we start at the origin when

      = 0 and return to it at  = , and as the reader can verify, we are at the origin exactly

     when  = k for integers k. On the curve r = 2 - 2 sin(), however, we reach the origin when

       =  2 ,  and  more  generally,  when    =       + 2k         for  integers  k.  There   is  no  integer   value  of  k
                                                   2
                       
     for  which  k  =  2  +  2k  which      means  while        the  origin  is  on  both  graphs,    the  point  is  never

     reached simultaneously. In any case, we have determined the three points of intersection to

     be 1, 6 , 1, 56 and the origin.

2. As before, we make a quick sketch of r = 2 and r = 3 cos() to get feel for the number and
   location of the intersection points. The graph of r = 2 is a circle, centered at the origin, with
   a radius of 2. The graph of r = 3 cos() is also a circle - but this one is centered at the point
   with rectangular coordinates 32 , 0 and has a radius of 32 .

                                                                y

                                            r = 2 and r = 3 cos()

     We have two intersection points to find, one in Quadrant I and one in Quadrant IV. Pro-
     ceeding as above, we first determine if any of the intersection points P have a represen-
     tation (r, ) which satisfies both r = 2 and r = 3 cos(). Equating these two expressions
     for r, we get cos() = 23 . To solve this equation, we need the arccosine function. We get

results algebraically and geometrically.

3. Proceeding as above, we first graph r = 3 and r = 6 cos(2) to get an idea of how many

   intersection points to expect and where they lie. The graph of r = 3 is a circle centered at
   the origin with a radius of 3 and the graph of r = 6 cos(2) is another four-leafed rose.12

                                   r = 3 and r = 6 cos(2)

It appears as if there are eight points of intersection - two in each quadrant. We first look to

see if there any points P (r, ) with a representation that satisfies both r = 3 and r = 6 cos(2).

For  these  points,  6 cos(2) = 3  or  cos(2) =            12 .  Solving,  we  get    =     + k  or    =  5  + k
                                                                                         6                6

for integers k. Out of all of these solutions, we obtain just four distinct points represented

by 3, 6 , 3, 56 , 3, 76 and 3, 11 6 . To determine the coordinates of the remaining four
points, we have to consider how the representations of the points of intersection can differ. We

know from Section 11.4 that if (r, ) and (r ,  ) represent the same point and r = 0, then either

r = r or r = -r . If r = r , then  = +2k, so one possibility is that an intersection point P

has a representation (r, ) which satisfies r = 3 and another representation (r, +2k) for some

integer, k which satisfies r = 6 cos(2). At this point,13 if we replace every occurrence of  in

the equation r = 6 cos(2) with (+2k) and then see if, by equating the resulting expressions

for r, we get any more solutions for . Since cos(2( + 2k)) = cos(2 + 4k) = cos(2) for

every integer k, however, the equation r = 6 cos(2( + 2k)) reduces to the same equation

we had before, r = 6 cos(2), which means we get no additional solutions. Moving on to

the case where r = -r , we have that  =  + (2k + 1) for integers k. We look to see

if we can find points P which have a representation (r, ) that satisfies r = 3 and another,

  12See Example 11.5.2 number 3.
  13The authors have chosen to replace  with  + 2k in the equation r = 6 cos(2) for illustration purposes only. We
could have just as easily chosen to do this substitution in the equation r = 3. Since there is no  in r = 3, however,
this case would reduce to the previous case instantly. The reader is encouraged to follow this latter procedure in the
interests of efficiency.

     (-r,  + (2k + 1)), that satisfies r = 6 cos(2). To do this, we substitute14 (-r) for r and

     ( + (2k + 1)) for  in the equation r = 6 cos(2) and get -r = 6 cos(2( + (2k + 1))).

     Since cos(2( + (2k + 1))) = cos(2 + (2k + 1)(2)) = cos(2) for all integers k, the equation

     -r = 6 cos(2( + (2k + 1))) reduces to -r = 6 cos(2), or r = -6 cos(2). Coupling this

     equation   with  r  =   3  gives  -6 cos(2)     =  3  or   cos(2)  =  - 12 .  We  get     =     + k  or    =  2  + k.
                                                                                                  3                3
     From these solutions, we obtain15 the remaining four intersection points with representations

     -3,     ,     -3, 23 ,     -3, 43    and    -3, 53 , which we can readily check graphically.

4. As usual,       we begin by graphing r            =  3 sin          and r   =   3 cos       .     Using the techniques
                                                                   2                        2

     presented in Example 11.5.2, we find that we need to plot both functions as  ranges from

     0 to 4 to obtain the complete graph. To our surprise and/or delight, it appears as if these

     two equations describe the same curve!

                                appear to determine the same curve in the xy-plane

     To verify this incredible claim,16 we need to show that, in fact, the graphs of these two

     equations intersect at all points on the plane. Suppose P has a representation (r, ) which

     satisfies both r = 3 sin             and r = 3 cos            .   Equating these two expressions for r gives
                                       2                        2
                                      = 3 cos 2 . While normally we discourage dividing by a variable
     the equation 3 sin         2

     expression (in case it could be 0), we note here that if 3 cos                       = 0, then for our equation
                                                                                       2
                      
     to hold, 3 sin   2      = 0 as well. Since no angles have both cosine and sine equal to zero,

     we are safe to divide both sides of the equation 3 sin                        = 3 cos           by 3 cos      to get
                                                                               2                  2             2
                                             
     tan  2     =  1  which     gives     =  2  + 2k       for  integers   k.  From these solutions, however, we

14Again, we could have easily chosen to substitute these into r = 3 which would give -r = 3, or r = -3.
15We obtain these representations by substituting the values for  into r = 6 cos(2), once again, for illustration

purposes. Again, in the interests of efficiency, we could `plug' these values for  into r = 3 (where there is no ) and

get the list of points: 3, 3 , 3, 23 , 3, 34 and 3, 35 . While it is not true that 3, 3 represents the same point
as -3, 3 , we still get the same set of solutions.
16A quick sketch of r = 3 sin                        
                                   2  and r = 3 cos  2  in the r-plane will convince you that, viewed as functions of r,

these are two different animals.

get only one intersection point which can be represented by 2 3 2 , 2 . We now investigate

other representations for the intersection points. Suppose P is an intersection point with

a representation (r, ) which satisfies r = 3 sin                        and the same point P has a different
                                                                     2
representation (r,  + 2k) for some integer k which satisfies r = 3 cos 2 . Substituting
                                                1                           
into the latter, we get r = 3 cos               2  [  +  2k]      = 3 cos   2  +  k    .  Using the sum formula for

cosine, we expand 3 cos               +  k  = 3 cos            cos(k) - 3 sin             sin (k) = ±3 cos             ,  since
                                 2                          2                     2                                 2

sin(k) = 0 for all integers k, and cos (k) = ±1 for all integers k. If k is an even integer,

we get the same equation r = 3 cos                       as before.     If k is odd, we get r = -3 cos                 .  This
                                                   2                                                                2
                                                                                                      
latter expression for r leads to the equation 3 sin                  2  = -3 cos       2  , or tan    2  = -1. Solving,
                                                                                                         
we get  = - 2 + 2k for integers k, which gives the intersection point 3 2 2 , - 2 . Next,

we assume P      has a representation (r, ) which satisfies r = 3 sin                              and a representation
                                                                                             2
                                                                  
(-r,  + (2k + 1)) which satisfies r = 3 cos                       2  for some integer k. Substituting (-r) for

r and ( + (2k + 1)) in for  into r = 3 cos                           gives -r = 3 cos        1  [ + (2k + 1)]          .  Once
                                                                  2                          2

again, we use the sum formula for cosine to get

            cos  1  [  +   (2k  +     1)]       = cos 2 + 2 (2k+1)
                 2

                                                = cos 2 cos 2 (2k+1) - sin 2 sin 2 (2k+1)

                                                =     ± sin    
                                                               2

where the last equality is true since cos 2 (2k+1) = 0 and sin 2 (2k+1) = ±1 for integers k.

Hence, -r = 3 cos       1  [  +    (2k   +  1)]       can be rewritten as r = ±3 sin               .  If we choose k = 0,
                        2                                                                       2

then sin  (2k+1)       = sin             = 1, and the equation -r = 3 cos              1  [  +  (2k   +  1)]     in this case
               2                   2                                                   2

reduces to -r = -3 sin                , or r = 3 sin           which is the other equation under consideration!
                                2                        2
                                                                                                                             
What  this  means   is  that    if    a  polar  representation       (r, )  for   the  point    P  satisfies  r  =  3  sin(  2  ),

then the representation (-r,  + ) for P                     automatically satisfies r = 3 cos                 .  Hence the
                                                                                                         2
equations r = 3 sin( 2 ) and r = 3 cos( 2 ) determine the same set of points in the plane.

Our work in Example 11.5.3 justifies the following.

To find the points of intersection of the graphs of two polar equations E1 and E2:

 Sketch the graphs of E1 and E2. Check to see if the curves intersect at the origin (pole).

 Solve for pairs (r, ) which satisfy both E1 and E2.

 Substitute ( + 2k) for  in either one of E1 or E2 (but not both) and solve for pairs (r, )
   which satisfy both equations. Keep in mind that k is an integer.

Solution. Our first step in these problems is to sketch the graphs of the polar equations involved
to get a sense of the geometric situation. Since all of the equations in this example are found in
either Example 11.5.2 or Example 11.5.3, most of the work is done for us.

1. We know from Example 11.5.2 number 3 that the graph of r = 5 sin(2) is a rose. Moreover,

     we know from our work there that as 0    2 , we are tracing out the `leaf' of the rose
     which lies in the first quadrant. The inequality 0  r  5 sin(2) means we want to capture

     all of the points between the origin (r = 0) and the curve r = 5 sin(2) as  runs through

     0, 2 . Hence, the region we seek is the leaf itself.

2. We know from Example 11.5.3 number 3 that r = 3 and r = 6 cos(2) intersect at  = 6 , so
   the region that is being described here is the set of points whose directed distance r from the

   origin is at least 3 but no more than 6 cos(2) as  runs from 0 to 6 . In other words, we are
   looking at the points outside or on the circle (since r  3) but inside or on the rose (since

     r  6 cos(2)). We shade the region below.

3. From Example 11.5.2 number 2, we know that the graph of r = 2 + 4 cos() is a lima¸con

whose  `inner       loop'     is  traced    out  as    runs      through    the  given   values  2    to  43 .           Since   the  values
                                                                                                 3

r takes on in this interval are non-positive, the inequality 2 + 4 cos()  r  0 makes sense,

and we are looking for all of the points between the pole r = 0 and the lima¸con as  ranges

over the interval 32 , 34 . In other words, we shade in the inner loop of the lima¸con.

4. We have two regions described here connected with the union symbol `.' We shade each

in turn and find our final answer by combining the two. In Example 11.5.3, number 1, we

found that the curves r = 2 sin() and r = 2 - 2 sin() intersect when  = 6 . Hence, for the
                                                                   
first region,       (r, ) | 0        r      2 sin(), 0             6     , we are shading the region between the origin

(r = 0) out to the circle (r = 2 sin()) as  ranges from 0 to 6 , which is the angle of intersection
                                                                                                                           
of the two curves. For the second region,                        (r, ) | 0      r    2  -   2 sin(),  6                    2  ,  picks up

where  it  left  off  at          and    continues   to   2 .  In  this  case,  however,    we   are  shading              from  the  origin
                              6

these two regions together gives us our final answer.

While the authors truly believe that graphing polar curves by hand is fundamental to your under-
standing of the polar coordinate system, we would be derelict in our duties if we totally ignored
the graphing calculator. Indeed, there are some important polar curves which are simply too dif-
ficult to graph by hand and that makes the calculator an important tool for your further studies
in Mathematics, Science and Engineering. We now give a brief demonstration of how to use the
graphing calculator to plot polar curves. The first thing you must do is switch the MODE of your
calculator to POL, which stands for "polar".

This changes the "Y=" menu as seen above in the middle. Let's plot the polar rose given by
r = 3 cos(4) from Exercise 8 above. We type the function into the "r=" menu as seen above on
the right. We need to set the viewing window so that the curve displays properly, but when we
look at the WINDOW menu, we find three extra lines.

In order for the calculator to be able to plot r = 3 cos(4) in the xy-plane, we need to tell it not
only the dimensions which x and y will assume, but we also what values of  to use. From our
previous work, we know that we need 0    2, so we enter the data you see above. (I'll say
more about the -step in just a moment.) Hitting GRAPH yields the curve below on the left which
doesn't look quite right. The issue here is that the calculator screen is 96 pixels wide but only 64
pixels tall. To get a true geometric perspective, we need to hit ZOOM SQUARE (seen below in
the middle) to produce a more accurate graph which we present below on the right.

In function mode, the calculator automatically divided the interval [Xmin, Xmax] into 96 equal
subintervals. In polar mode, however, we must specify how to split up the interval [min, max]
using the step. For most graphs, a step of 0.1 is fine. If you make it too small then the calculator
takes a long time to graph. It you make it too big, you get chunky garbage like this.

You will need to experiment with the settings in order to get a nice graph. Exercises 51 - 60 give
you some curves to graph using your calculator. Notice that some of them have explicit bounds on
 and others do not.

     the polar rose r = sin(n) has for any natural number n. Replace sine with cosine and repeat
     the investigation. How many petals does r = cos(n) have for each natural number n?

Looking back through the graphs in the section, it's clear that many polar curves enjoy various
forms of symmetry. However, classifying symmetry for polar curves is not as straight-forward as it
was for equations back on page 26. In Exercises 62 - 64, we have you and your classmates explore
some of the more basic forms of symmetry seen in common polar curves.

62. Show that if f is even17 then the graph of r = f () is symmetric about the x-axis.

(a) Show that f () = 2 + 4 cos() is even and verify that the graph of r = 2 + 4 cos() is
     indeed symmetric about the x-axis. (See Example 11.5.2 number 2.)

(b) Show that f () = 3 sin     is not even, yet the graph of r = 3 sin     is symmetric about
                            2                                           2

the x-axis. (See Example 11.5.3 number 4.)

63. Show that if f is odd18 then the graph of r = f () is symmetric about the origin.

(a) Show that f () = 5 sin(2) is odd and verify that the graph of r = 5 sin(2) is indeed
     symmetric about the origin. (See Example 11.5.2 number 3.)

(b) Show that f () = 3 cos     is not odd, yet the graph of r = 3 cos      is symmetric about
                            2                                           2

the origin. (See Example 11.5.3 number 4.)

64. Show that if f ( - ) = f () for all  in the domain of f then the graph of r = f () is
     symmetric about the y-axis.

      (a) For f () = 4 - 2 sin(), show that f ( - ) = f () and the graph of r = 4 - 2 sin() is
           symmetric about the y-axis, as required. (See Example 11.5.2 number 1.)

17Recall that this means f (-) = f () for  in the domain of f .
18Recall that this means f (-) = -f () for  in the domain of f .

     symmetric about the y-axis. (See Example 11.5.2 number 3.)

In Section 1.7, we discussed transformations of graphs. In Exercise 65 we have you and your
classmates explore transformations of polar graphs.

65. For Exercises 65a and 65b below, let f () = cos() and g() = 2 - sin().

     (a) Using your graphing calculator, compare the graph of r = f () to each of the graphs of
          r = f  + 4 , r = f  + 34 , r = f  - 4 and r = f  - 34 . Repeat this process
          for g(). In general, how do you think the graph of r = f ( + ) compares with the

          graph of r = f ()?

     (b) Using your graphing calculator, compare the graph of r = f () to each of the graphs of
          r = 2f (), r = 12 f (), r = -f () and r = -3f (). Repeat this process for g(). In
          general, how do you think the graph of r = k · f () compares with the graph of r = f ()?

          (Does it matter if k > 0 or k < 0?)

66. In light of Exercises 62 - 64, how would the graph of r = f (-) compare with the graph of
     r = f () for a generic function f ? What about the graphs of r = -f () and r = f ()? What
     about r = f () and r = f ( - )? Test out your conjectures using a variety of polar functions
     found in this section with the help of a graphing utility.

67. With the help of your classmates, research cardioid microphones.

68. Back in Section 1.2, in the paragraph before Exercise 53, we gave you this link to a fascinating

11.6 Hooked on Conics Again

In this section, we revisit our friends the Conic Sections which we began studying in Chapter 7.

Our first task is to formalize the notion of rotating axes so this subsection is actually a follow-up

to Example 8.3.3 in Section 8.3.  In that example, we saw that the graph of y =  2  is actually a
                                                                                 x
hyperbola. More specifically, it is the hyperbola obtained by rotating the graph of x2 - y2 = 4

counter-clockwise through a 45 angle. Armed with polar coordinates, we can generalize the process

of rotating axes as shown below.

11.6.1 Rotation of Axes

Consider the x- and y-axes below along with the dashed x - and y -axes obtained by rotating the x-
and y-axes counter-clockwise through an angle  and consider the point P (x, y). The coordinates
(x, y) are rectangular coordinates and are based on the x- and y-axes. Suppose we wished to find
rectangular coordinates based on the x - and y -axes. That is, we wish to determine P (x , y ). While
this seems like a formidable challenge, it is nearly trivial if we use polar coordinates. Consider the
angle  whose initial side is the positive x -axis and whose terminal side contains the point P .

                                                                                           y

                                  y P (x, y) = P (x , y ) x

                                  
                                               
                                                    

                                                                             x

We relate P (x, y) and P (x , y ) by converting them to polar coordinates. Converting P (x, y) to
polar coordinates with r > 0 yields x = r cos( + ) and y = r sin( + ). To convert the point
P (x , y ) into polar coordinates, we first match the polar axis with the positive x -axis, choose the
same r > 0 (since the origin is the same in both systems) and get x = r cos() and y = r sin().
Using the sum formulas for sine and cosine, we have

x = r cos( + )

= r cos() cos() - r sin() sin() Sum formula for cosine

= (r cos()) cos() - (r sin()) sin()

= x cos() - y sin()                  Since x = r cos() and y = r sin()

Similarly, using the sum formula for sine we get y = x sin() + y cos(). These equations enable us
to easily convert points with x y -coordinates back into xy-coordinates. They also enable us to easily
convert equations in the variables x and y into equations in the variables in terms of x and y .1 If
we want equations which enable us to convert points with xy-coordinates into x y -coordinates, we
need to solve the system

            x cos() - y sin() = x
            x sin() + y cos() = y

for x and y . Perhaps the cleanest way2 to solve this system is to write it as a matrix equation.
Using the machinery developed in Section 8.4, we write the above system as the matrix equation
AX = X where

         A = cos() - sin() , X = x , X = x
         sin() cos()                y  y

Since det(A) = (cos())(cos()) - (- sin())(sin()) = cos2() + sin2() = 1, the determinant of
A is not zero so A is invertible and X = A-1X. Using the formula given in Equation 8.2 with

det(A) = 1, we find

            A-1 = cos() sin()
                        - sin() cos()

so that

            X = A-1X

         x=           cos() sin() x

         y   - sin() cos() y

         x = x cos() + y sin()
         y   -x sin() + y cos()

From which we get x = x cos() + y sin() and y = -x sin() + y cos(). To summarize,

Theorem 11.9. Rotation of Axes: Suppose the positive x and y axes are rotated counter-
clockwise through an angle  to produce the axes x and y , respectively. Then the coordinates
P (x, y) and P (x , y ) are related by the following systems of equations

         x = x cos() - y sin() and  x = x cos() + y sin()
         y = x sin() + y cos()      y = -x sin() + y cos()

We put the formulas in Theorem 11.9 to good use in the following example.

    1Sound familiar? In Section 11.4, the equations x = r cos() and y = r sin() make it easy to convert points
from polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates, and they make it easy to convert equations from rectangular
coordinates into polar coordinates.

    2We could, of course, interchange the roles of x and x , y and y and replace  with - to get x and y in terms
of x and y, but that seems like cheating. The matrix A introduced here is revisited in the Exercises.

  1. Let P (x, y) = (2, -4) and find P (x , y ). Check your answer algebraically and graphically.
  2. Convert the equation 21x2 + 10xy3 + 31y2 = 144 to an equation in x and y and graph.

Solution.

  1. If P (x, y) = (2, -4) then x = 2 and y = -4. Using these values for x and y along with

        =      ,  Theorem  11.9  gives    x  = x cos() + y sin() = 2 cos            + (-4) sin                           which simplifies
            3                                                                 3                                 3

        to x = 1 - 2 3. Similarly, y = -x sin() + y cos() = (-2) sin 3 + (-4) cos 3 which
                                                                                                             
        gives y = - 3 - 2 = -2 - 3. Hence P (x , y ) = 1 - 2 3, -2 - 3 . To check our answer
                                                                                                                            
        algebraically, we use the formulas in Theorem 11.9 to convert P (x , y ) = 1 - 2 3, -2 - 3

        back into x and y coordinates. We get

                                       x = x cos() - y sin()
                                           = (1 - 23) cos 3 - (-2 - 3) sin 3
                                           = 21 - 3 - -3 - 23
                                           =2

        Similarly, using y = x sin() + y cos(), we obtain y = -4 as required. To check our answer
        graphically, we sketch in the x -axis and y -axis to see if the new coordinates P (x , y ) =
         1 - 2 3, -2 - 3  (-2.46, -3.73) seem reasonable. Our graph is below.

  2. To convert the equation 21x2 +10xy3+31y2 =144 to an equation in the variables x and y ,
                                                         x  -y     3                                                        = 2 x 3 + 2y
        we substitute x = x cos     3     - y sin  3  =  2            and  y  =  x  sin                      3  + y cos  3

     and simplify. While this is by no means a trivial task, it is nothing more than a hefty dose
     of Beginning Algebra. We will not go through the entire computation, but rather, the reader
     should take the time to do it. Start by verifying that

      2 (x )2 x y 3 3(y )2         (x )23 x y (y )23                                                     2 3(x )2 x y 3 (y )2
     x= 4 - 2 + 4 ,         xy = 4 - 2 - 4 ,                                                            y= 4 + 2 + 4

     To our surprise and delight, the equation 21x2 + 10xy3 + 31y2 = 144 in xy-coordinates

     reduces to 36(x )2 + 16(y )2 = 144, or 4 (x )2 + 9 (y )2 = 1 in x y -coordinates. The latter is an
     ellipse centered at (0, 0) with vertices along the y -axis with (x y -coordinates) (0, ±3) and

     whose minor axis has endpoints with (x y -coordinates) (±2, 0). We graph it below.

                                                                                                     3

                                                                                                        x

                                                 21x2 + 10xy3 + 31y2 = 144

The elimination of the troublesome `xy' term from the equation 21x2 + 10xy3 + 31y2 = 144 in
Example 11.6.1 number 2 allowed us to graph the equation by hand using what we learned in
Chapter 7. It is natural to wonder if we can always do this. That is, given an equation of the form
Ax2 +Bxy +Cy2 +Dx+Ey +F = 0, with B = 0, is there an angle  so that if we rotate the x and y-
axes counter-clockwise through that angle , the equation in the rotated variables x and y contains
no x y term? To explore this conjecture, we make the usual substitutions x = x cos() - y sin()
and y = x sin() + y cos() into the equation Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 and set the
coefficient of the x y term equal to 0. Terms containing x y in this expression will come from the
first three terms of the equation: Ax2, Bxy and Cy2. We leave it to the reader to verify that

                  x2 = (x )2 cos2() - 2x y cos() sin() + (y )2 sin()
                  xy = (x )2 cos() sin() + x y cos2() - sin2() - (y )2 cos() sin()
                  y2 = (x )2 sin2() + 2x y cos() sin() + (y )2 cos2()
11.6 Hooked on Conics Again                                                                                         977

The contribution to the x y -term from Ax2 is -2A cos() sin(), from Bxy it is B cos2() - sin2() ,
and from Cy2 it is 2C cos() sin(). Equating the x y -term to 0, we get

-2A cos() sin() + B cos2() - sin2() + 2C cos() sin() = 0
                                -A sin(2) + B cos(2) + C sin(2) = 0 Double Angle Identities

From this, we get B cos(2) = (A - C) sin(2), and our goal is to solve for  in terms of the

coefficients A, B and C. Since we are assuming B = 0, we can divide both sides of this equation

by B. To solve for  we would like to divide both sides of the equation by sin(2), provided of

course that we have assurances that sin(2) = 0. If sin(2) = 0, then we would have B cos(2) = 0,

and since B = 0, this would force cos(2) = 0. Since no angle  can have both sin(2) = 0 and

cos(2)  =  0,  we  can  safely  assume3  sin(2)  =   0.  We  get  cos(2)   =  B A-C ,  or  cot(2)  =   B A-C .  We  have
                                                                  sin(2)
just proved the following theorem.

Theorem 11.10. The equation Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 with B = 0 can be

transformed into an equation in variables x and y without any x y terms by rotating the x-
and y- axes counter-clockwise through an angle  which satisfies cot(2) = B A-C .

We put Theorem 11.10 to good use in the following example.

Example 11.6.2. Graph the following equations.
   1. 5x2 + 26xy + 5y2 - 16x2 + 16y2 - 104 = 0

2. 16x2 + 24xy + 9y2 + 15x - 20y = 0

Solution.

1. Since the equation 5x2 + 26xy + 5y2 - 16x2 + 16y2 - 104 = 0 is already given to us

in the form required by Theorem 11.10, we identify A = 5, B = 26 and C = 5 so that

cot(2) =           A-C  =  5-5  = 0.  This means cot(2) = 0 which gives                =        + 2 k  for integers k.
                     B      26                                                               4                      

We         choose    =     so   that  our  rotation  equations    are   x  =  x2   -   y2    and   y   =  x2    +   2 y 2 .
                        4                                                       2        2                  2

The reader should verify that

               x2 = (x )2 - x y + (y )2 ,        xy = (x )2 - (y )2 ,         y2 = (x )2 + x y + (y )2
                        2                  2             2           2                 2                  2

Making the other substitutions, we get that 5x2 + 26xy + 5y2 - 16x2 + 16y2 - 104 = 0

reduces to 18(x )2 - 8(y )2 + 32y - 104 = 0, or 4 (x )2 - 9 (y -2)2 = 1. The latter is the equation

of a hyperbola centered at the x y -coordinates (0, 2) opening in the x direction with vertices

(±2, 2) (in x y -coordinates) and asymptotes y               =    ±  3  x  + 2.  We graph it below.
                                                                     2

3The reader is invited to think about the case sin(2) = 0 geometrically. What happens to the axes in this case?

2. From 16x2 + 24xy + 9y2 + 15x - 20y = 0, we get A = 16, B = 24 and C = 9 so that

        cot(2) = 724 . Since this isn't one of the values of the common angles, we will need to use
        inverse functions. Ultimately, we need to find cos() and sin(), which means we have two

        options. If we use the arccotangent function immediately, after the usual calculations we

        get  = 12 arccot         7      .  To get cos() and sin() from this, we would need to use half angle
                                 24
        identities. Alternatively, we can start with cot(2) = 724 , use a double angle identity, and
        then go after cos() and sin(). We adopt the second approach. From cot(2) = 724 , we have
                                                                                                                                2 tan()
        tan(2) =       247 .  Using the double angle identity for tangent, we have                                             1-tan2()     =   247 , which

        gives 24 tan2() + 14 tan() - 24 = 0. Factoring, we get 2(3 tan() + 4)(4 tan() - 3) = 0 which

        gives tan() = - 43 or tan() = 34 . While either of these values of tan() satisfies the equation
        cot(2) = 724 , we choose tan() = 34 , since this produces an acute angle,4  = arctan                                                        3

        find the rotation equations, we need cos() = cos                            arctan      3     and sin() = sin                       arctan        3   .
                                                                                                4                                                         4
                                                                                                      4                               35 .
        Using  the  techniques          developed  in  Section    10.6       we     get  cos()  =     5  and  sin()                =        Our    rotation

        equations   are       x  =   x  cos() - y  sin()       =  4x         - 53y  and  y      =  x  sin() + y                cos()        =   3x     + 54y .
                                                                   5                                                                             5
        As usual, we now substitute these quantities into 16x2 + 24xy + 9y2 + 15x - 20y = 0 and

        simplify. As a first step, the reader can verify

        x2 = 16(x )2 - 24x y + 9(y )2 ,            xy = 12(x )2 + 7x y - 12(y )2 ,                       y2 = 9(x )2 + 24x y + 16(y )2

        Once the dust settles, we get 25(x )2 - 25y = 0, or y = (x )2, whose graph is a parabola
        opening along the positive y -axis with vertex (0, 0). We graph this equation below.

4As usual, there are infinitely many solutions to tan() = 43 .                      We choose the acute angle  = arctan                             3  .  The

reader  is  encouraged  to    think  about  why  there  is  always       at  least  one  acute  answer   to  cot(2) =                B      and    what   this

means geometrically in terms of what we are trying to accomplish by rotating the axes. The reader is also encouraged

to keep a sharp lookout for the angles which satisfy tan() = - 34 in our final graph. (Hint:                                   3   - 34 = -1.)

11.6 Hooked on Conics Again                                                                            979

We note that even though the coefficients of x2 and y2 were both positive numbers in parts 1 and 2
of Example 11.6.2, the graph in part 1 turned out to be a hyperbola and the graph in part 2 worked
out to be a parabola. Whereas in Chapter 7, we could easily pick out which conic section we were
dealing with based on the presence (or absence) of quadratic terms and their coefficients, Example
11.6.2 demonstrates that all bets are off when it comes to conics with an xy term which require
rotation of axes to put them into a more standard form. Nevertheless, it is possible to determine
which conic section we have by looking at a special, familiar combination of the coefficients of the
quadratic terms. We have the following theorem.

 Theorem 11.11. Suppose the equation Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 describes a
 non-degenerate conic section.a

    If B2 - 4AC > 0 then the graph of the equation is a hyperbola.
    If B2 - 4AC = 0 then the graph of the equation is a parabola.
    If B2 - 4AC < 0 then the graph of the equation is an ellipse or circle.

  aRecall that this means its graph is either a circle, parabola, ellipse or hyperbola. See page 497.

As you may expect, the quantity B2 -4AC mentioned in Theorem 11.11 is called the discriminant

of the conic section. While we will not attempt to explain the deep Mathematics which produces this

`coincidence', we will at least work through the proof of Theorem 11.11 mechanically to show that it
is true.5 First note that if the coefficient B = 0 in the equation Ax2 +Bxy +Cy2 +Dx+Ey +F = 0,

Theorem 11.11 reduces to the result presented in Exercise 34 in Section 7.5, so we proceed here

under the assumption that B = 0. We rotate the xy-axes counter-clockwise through an angle

  which  satisfies  cot(2)  =  A-C  to  produce  an  equation  with  no  x y -term  in  accordance     with
                                 B
Theorem 11.10: A (x )2 + C(y )2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0. In this form, we can invoke Exercise 34

in Section 7.5 once more using the product A C . Our goal is to find the product A C in terms of

the coefficients A, B and C in the original equation. To that end, we make the usual substitutions
x = x cos() - y sin() y = x sin() + y cos() into Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0. We
leave it to the reader to show that, after gathering like terms, the coefficient A on (x )2 and the
coefficient C on (y )2 are

                            A = A cos2() + B cos() sin() + C sin2()

                            C = A sin2() - B cos() sin() + C cos2()

In order to make use of the condition cot(2) = B A-C , we rewrite our formulas for A and C using
the power reduction formulas. After some regrouping, we get

                                2A = [(A + C) + (A - C) cos(2)] + B sin(2)
                                2C = [(A + C) - (A - C) cos(2)] - B sin(2)
Next, we try to make sense of the product

(2A )(2C ) = {[(A + C) + (A - C) cos(2)] + B sin(2)} {[(A + C) - (A - C) cos(2)] - B sin(2)}

   5We hope that someday you get to see why this works the way it does.
980                                                                      Applications of Trigonometry

We break this product into pieces. First, we use the difference of squares to multiply the `first'
quantities in each factor to get

[(A + C) + (A - C) cos(2)] [(A + C) - (A - C) cos(2)] = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 cos2(2)

Next, we add the product of the `outer' and `inner' quantities in each factor to get

                -B sin(2) [(A + C) + (A - C) cos(2)]
                +B sin(2) [(A + C) - (A - C) cos(2)] = -2B(A - C) cos(2) sin(2)

The product of the `last' quantity in each factor is (B sin(2))(-B sin(2)) = -B2 sin2(2). Putting
all of this together yields

      4A C = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 cos2(2) - 2B(A - C) cos(2) sin(2) - B2 sin2(2)

From  cot(2)  =  B A-C ,  we  get  cos(2)  =  B A-C ,  or  (A-C) sin(2)  =  B cos(2).  We  use  this  substitution
                                   sin(2)

twice along with the Pythagorean Identity cos2(2) = 1 - sin2(2) to get

      4A C    = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 cos2(2) - 2B(A - C) cos(2) sin(2) - B2 sin2(2)
              = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 1 - sin2(2) - 2B cos(2)B cos(2) - B2 sin2(2)
              = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 + (A - C)2 sin2(2) - 2B2 cos2(2) - B2 sin2(2)
              = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 + [(A - C) sin(2)]2 - 2B2 cos2(2) - B2 sin2(2)
              = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 + [B cos(2)]2 - 2B2 cos2(2) - B2 sin2(2)
              = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 + B2 cos2(2) - 2B2 cos2(2) - B2 sin2(2)
              = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 - B2 cos2(2) - B2 sin2(2)
              = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 - B2 cos2(2) + sin2(2)
              = (A + C)2 - (A - C)2 - B2
              = A2 + 2AC + C2 - A2 - 2AC + C2 - B2
              = 4AC - B2

Hence, B2 - 4AC = -4A C , so the quantity B2 - 4AC has the opposite sign of A C . The result
now follows by applying Exercise 34 in Section 7.5.

Example 11.6.3. Use Theorem 11.11 to classify the graphs of the following non-degenerate conics.

   1. 21x2 + 10xy3 + 31y2 = 144
   2. 5x2 + 26xy + 5y2 - 16x2 + 16y2 - 104 = 0

3. 16x2 + 24xy + 9y2 + 15x - 20y = 0

Solution. This is a straightforward application of Theorem 11.11.

1. We have A = 21, B = 103 and C = 31 so B2 - 4AC = (103)2 - 4(21)(31) = -2304 < 0.
   Theorem 11.11 predicts the graph is an ellipse, which checks with our work from Example
   11.6.1 number 2.

2. Here, A = 5, B = 26 and C = 5, so B2 - 4AC = 262 - 4(5)(5) = 576 > 0. Theorem 11.11
   classifies the graph as a hyperbola, which matches our answer to Example 11.6.2 number 1.

3. Finally, we have A = 16, B = 24 and C = 9 which gives 242 - 4(16)(9) = 0. Theorem 11.11
   tells us that the graph is a parabola, matching our result from Example 11.6.2 number 2.

11.6.2 The Polar Form of Conics

In this subsection, we start from scratch to reintroduce the conic sections from a more unified
perspective. We have our `new' definition below.

 Definition 11.1. Given a fixed line L, a point F not on L, and a positive number e, a conic
 section is the set of all points P such that

                                             the distance from P to F = e
                                             the distance from P to L
 The line L is called the directrix of the conic section, the point F is called a focus of the conic
 section, and the constant e is called the eccentricity of the conic section.

We have seen the notions of focus and directrix before in the definition of a parabola, Definition 7.3.
There, a parabola is defined as the set of points equidistant from the focus and directrix, giving an
eccentricity e = 1 according to Definition 11.1. We have also seen the concept of eccentricity before.
It was introduced for ellipses in Definition 7.5 in Section 7.4, and later extended to hyperbolas in
Exercise 31 in Section 7.5. There, e was also defined as a ratio of distances, though in these cases
the distances involved were measurements from the center to a focus and from the center to a
vertex. One way to reconcile the `old' ideas of focus, directrix and eccentricity with the `new' ones
presented in Definition 11.1 is to derive equations for the conic sections using Definition 11.1 and
compare these parameters with what we know from Chapter 7. We begin by assuming the conic
section has eccentricity e, a focus F at the origin and that the directrix is the vertical line x = -d
as in the figure below.

                                                                                           y

                             d  r cos()

                                          P (r, )

                                     r

                                        

                                O=F                x

x = -d
982                                                                    Applications of Trigonometry

Using a polar coordinate representation P (r, ) for a point on the conic with r > 0, we get

                                   e = the distance from P to F = r
                                         the distance from P to L d + r cos()

so that r = e(d + r cos()). Solving this equation for r, yields
                                                      r = ed
                                                            1 - e cos()

At this point, we convert the equation r = e(d + r cos()) back into a rectangular equation in the
variables x and y. If e > 0, but e = 1, the usual conversion process outlined in Section 11.4 gives6

                             1 - e2 2                e2d 2 1 - e2 2
                              e2d2               x-         2 + 2 2 y =1
                                                     1-e             ed

We leave it to the reader to show if 0 < e < 1, this is the equation of an ellipse centered at 2 12-e2 e2d , 0
with major axis along the x-axis. Using the notation from Section 7.4, we have a2 = e d (1-e2)2 and

b2 = 1e-2de22 , so the major axis has length 12-eed2 and the minor axis has length 2ed 1-e2 . Moreover, we find
that one focus is (0, 0) and working through the formula given in Definition 7.5 gives the eccentricity

to be e, as required. If e > 1, then the equation generates a hyperbola with center 1-e2 e2d , 0 whose

transverse axis lies along the x-axis. Since such hyperbolas have the form a2 (x-h)2 - b2 y2 = 1, we need
to take the opposite reciprocal of the coefficient of y2 to find b2. We get7 a2 = (1-e2)2 e2d2 = (e2-1)2 e2d2 and

b2 = - e2d2 1-e2 = ee22d2 -1 , so the transverse axis has length 2e2ed-1 and the conjugate axis has length 2ee2d-1 .
Additionally, we verify that one focus is at (0, 0), and the formula given in Exercise 31 in Section

7.5 gives the eccentricity is e in this case as well.       If e = 1,  the equation r =       ed         reduces to
                                                                                         1-e cos()

r = 1-cos() d which gives the rectangular equation y2 = 2d x + d2 . This is a parabola with vertex

-   d  ,  0  opening to the right. In the language of Section 7.3, 4p = 2d so p = d2 , the focus is (0, 0),
    2

the focal diameter is 2d and the directrix is x = -d, as required. Hence, we have shown that in all

cases, our `new' understanding of `conic section', `focus', `eccentricity' and `directrix' as presented

in Definition 11.1 correspond with the `old' definitions given in Chapter 7.

Before we summarize our findings, we note that in order to arrive at our general equation of a conic

r = 1-e cos() ed , we assumed that the directrix was the line x = -d for d > 0. We could have just as
easily chosen the directrix to be x = d, y = -d or y = d. As the reader can verify, in these cases

we  obtain   the  forms  r=  1+e cos() ed ,  r=       ed    and  r=  1+e sin() ed ,  respectively.  The  key  thing  to
                                                 1-e sin()
remember is that in any of these cases, the directrix is always perpendicular to the major axis of

an ellipse and it is always perpendicular to the transverse axis of the hyperbola. For parabolas,

knowing the focus is (0, 0) and the directrix also tells us which way the parabola opens. We have

established the following theorem.

    6Turn r = e(d + r cos()) into r = e(d + x) and square both sides to get r2 = e2(d + x)2. Replace r2 with x2 + y2,
expand (d + x)2, combine like terms, complete the square on x and clean things up.

    7Since e > 1 in this case, 1 - e2 < 0. Hence, we rewrite 1 - e2 2 = e2 - 1 2 to help simplify things later on.

Theorem 11.12. Suppose e and d are positive numbers. Then

      the    graph      of  r=         ed        is  the  graph      of  a  conic    section  with     directrix    x = -d.
                                  1-e cos()

      the    graph      of  r=         ed        is  the  graph      of  a  conic    section  with     directrix    x = d.
                                  1+e cos()

      the    graph      of  r=         ed        is  the  graph      of  a  conic    section  with     directrix    y  = -d.
                                  1-e sin()

      the    graph      of  r=         ed        is  the  graph      of  a  conic    section  with     directrix    y  = d.
                                  1+e sin()

In each case above, (0, 0) is a focus of the conic and the number e is the eccentricity of the conic.

      If  0  <   e  <   1,  the    graph     is  an      ellipse  whose     major    axis    has      length   2ed     and    whose    minor
                                                                                                              1-e2

      axis has length 2ed 1-e2

     If e = 1, the graph is a parabola whose focal diameter is 2d.

      If  e  >   1,     the  graph      is   a   hyperbola           whose    transverse      axis    has     length    2ed      and  whose
                                                                                                                       e2-1

      conjugate axis has length 2ee2d-1 .

We test out Theorem 11.12 in the next example.

Example 11.6.4. Sketch the graphs of the following equations.

1. r = 4                                             2. r = 12                                         3. r = 6
         1 - sin()                                            3 - cos()                                         1 + 2 sin()

Solution.

1. From r = 1-sin() 4 , we first note e = 1 which means we have a parabola on our hands. Since
   ed = 4, we have d = 4 and considering the form of the equation, this puts the directrix

     at y = -4. Since the focus is at (0, 0), we know that the vertex is located at the point

     (in rectangular coordinates) (0, -2) and must open upwards. With d = 4, we have a focal

     diameter       of  2d  =  8,  so   the  parabola         contains      the  points  (±4, 0).      We     graph    r   =       4       below.
                                                                                                                              1-sin()

2.   We   first  rewrite       r  =      12          in  the  form     found     in  Theorem      11.12,      namely       r  =  1-(1/3) cos() 4 .
                                     3-cos()

     Since   e  =   1   satisfies    0  <   e  <     1,  we   know     that   the    graph   of  this  equation        is  an    ellipse.  Since
                    3

     ed = 4, we have d = 12 and, based on the form of the equation, the directrix is x = -12.

     This means that the ellipse has its major axis along the x-axis. We can find the vertices

     of the ellipse by finding the points of the ellipse which lie on the x-axis. We find r(0) = 6

     and r() = 3 which correspond to the rectangular points (-3, 0) and (6, 0), so these are our

     vertices. The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the vertices, which in this case is 32 , 0 .8
                                                                  3                           32 , 0
     We   know      one     focus  is   (0, 0),   which       is  2  from   the  center               and this allows us to find the

8As   a  quick  check,  we   have  from    Theorem        11.12   the  major  axis   should  have     length   2ed  =    (2)(4)  = 9.
                                                                                                              1-e2     1-(1/3)2

     other focus (3, 0), even though we are not asked to do so. Finally, we know from Theorem
     11.12  that  the  length  of  the       minor      axis   is  2ed           =      4     2 = 6 3 which means the endpoints

                             r = 1-sin() 4

3. From r =             6    we    get            e  =  2  >   1  so  the        graph  is    a  hyperbola.      Since ed = 6, we get
                  1+2 sin()
     d = 3, and from the form of the equation, we know the directrix is y = 3. This means the

     transverse axis of the hyperbola lies along the y-axis, so we can find the vertices by looking

     where the hyperbola intersects the y-axis. We find r                                        = 2 and r     3  = -6. These two
                                                                                           2                   2

     points correspond to the rectangular points (0, 2) and (0, 6) which puts the center of the

     hyperbola at (0, 4). Since one focus is at (0, 0), which is 4 units away from the center, we

     know the other focus is at (0, 8). According to Theorem 11.12, the conjugate axis has a length
     of 2ed 2 =  2 (2)(6) = 43. Putting this together with the location of the vertices, we get that
         e -1          2 -1                                                                

     the asymptotes of the hyperbola have slopes ± 2 = ± 33 . Since the center of the hyperbola
                                                                                 23

In light of Section 11.6.1, the reader may wonder what the rotated form of the conic sections would

look like in polar form. We know from Exercise 65 in Section 11.5 that replacing  with ( - ) in

an expression r = f () rotates the graph of r = f () counter-clockwise by an angle . For instance,

to graph r = 1-sin4(-  all we need to do is rotate the graph of r = 4 ) 1-s4in() , which we obtained in
Example  11.6.4    number    1,  counter-clockwise   by              radians,  as  shown    below.

Using rotations, we can greatly simplify the form of the conic sections presented in Theorem 11.12,
since any three of the forms given there can be obtained from the fourth by rotating through some
multiple of 2 . Since rotations do not affect lengths, all of the formulas for lengths Theorem 11.12
remain intact. In the theorem below, we also generalize our formula for conic sections to include
circles centered at the origin by extending the concept of eccentricity to include e = 0. We conclude
this section with the statement of the following theorem.

 Theorem 11.13. Given constants > 0, e  0 and , the graph of the equation

                                                 r = 1 - e cos( - )
is a conic section with eccentricity e and one focus at (0, 0).

 If e = 0, the graph is a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius .

 If e = 0, then the conic has a focus at (0, 0) and the directrix contains the point with polar

coordinates (-d, ) where d = e .

11.7 Polar Form of Complex Numbers

In this section, we return to our study of complex numbers which were first introduced in Section
3.4. Recall that a complex number is a number of the form z = a + bi where a and b are real
numbers and i is the imaginary unit defined by i = -1. The number a is called the real part of
z, denoted Re(z), while the real number b is called the imaginary part of z, denoted Im(z). From
Intermediate Algebra, we know that if z = a + bi = c + di where a, b, c and d are real numbers,
then a = c and b = d, which means Re(z) and Im(z) are well-defined.1 To start off this section,
we associate each complex number z = a + bi with the point (a, b) on the coordinate plane. In
this case, the x-axis is relabeled as the real axis, which corresponds to the real number line as
usual, and the y-axis is relabeled as the imaginary axis, which is demarcated in increments of the
imaginary unit i. The plane determined by these two axes is called the complex plane.

The Complex Plane

Since the ordered pair (a, b) gives the rectangular coordinates associated with the complex number
z = a + bi, the expression z = a + bi is called the rectangular form of z. Of course, we could just
as easily associate z with a pair of polar coordinates (r, ). Although it is not as straightforward
as the definitions of Re(z) and Im(z), we can still give r and  special names in relation to z.

 Definition 11.2. The Modulus and Argument of Complex Numbers: Let z = a + bi be
 a complex number with a = Re(z) and b = Im(z). Let (r, ) be a polar representation of the
 point with rectangular coordinates (a, b) where r  0.

       The modulus of z, denoted |z|, is defined by |z| = r.

       The angle  is an argument of z. The set of all arguments of z is denoted arg(z).

       If z = 0 and - <   , then  is the principal argument of z, written  = Arg(z).

    1`Well-defined' means that no matter how we express z, the number Re(z) is always the same, and the number
Im(z) is always the same. In other words, Re and Im are functions of complex numbers.

Some remarks about Definition 11.2 are in order. We know from Section 11.4 that every point in
the plane has infinitely many polar coordinate representations (r, ) which means it's worth our
time to make sure the quantities `modulus', `argument' and `principal argument' are well-defined.
Concerning the modulus, if z = 0 then the point associated with z is the origin. In this case, the
only r-value which can be used here is r = 0. Hence for z = 0, |z| = 0 is well-defined. If z = 0,
then the point associated with z is not the origin, and there are two possibilities for r: one positive
and one negative. However, we stipulated r  0 in our definition so this pins down the value of |z|
to one and only one number. Thus the modulus is well-defined in this case, too.2 Even with the
requirement r  0, there are infinitely many angles  which can be used in a polar representation
of a point (r, ). If z = 0 then the point in question is not the origin, so all of these angles  are
coterminal. Since coterminal angles are exactly 2 radians apart, we are guaranteed that only one
of them lies in the interval (-, ], and this angle is what we call the principal argument of z,
Arg(z). In fact, the set arg(z) of all arguments of z can be described using set-builder notation as
arg(z) = {Arg(z) + 2k | k is an integer}. Note that since arg(z) is a set, we will write `  arg(z)'
to mean ` is in3 the set of arguments of z'. If z = 0 then the point in question is the origin,
which we know can be represented in polar coordinates as (0, ) for any angle . In this case, we
have arg(0) = (-, ) and since there is no one value of  which lies (-, ], we leave Arg(0)
undefined.4 It is time for an example.

Example 11.7.1. For each of the following complex numbers find Re(z), Im(z), |z|, arg(z) and
Arg(z). Plot z in the complex plane.

                2. z = -2 + 4i  3. z = 3i  4. z = -117
1. z = 3 - i

Solution.

                                
1. For z = 3 - i = 3 + (-1)i, we have Re(z) = 3 and Im(z) = -1. To find |z|, arg(z)
     and Arg(z), we need to find a polar representation (r, ) with r  0 for the point P ( 3, -1)
     associated with z. We know r2 = ( 3)2 + (-1)2 = 4, so r = ±2. Since we require r  0,

     we choose r = 2, so |z| = 2. Next, we find a corresponding angle . Since r > 0 and P lies
     in Quadrant IV,  is a Quadrant IV angle. We know tan() = -13 = - 33 , so  = - 6 + 2k
     for integers k. Hence, arg(z) = - 6 + 2k | k is an integer . Of these values, only  = - 6
     satisfies the requirement that - <   , hence Arg(z) = - 6 .

2. The complex number z = -2 + 4i has Re(z) = -2, Im(z) = 4, and is associated with the
   point P (-2, 4). Our next task is to find a polar representation (r,) for P where r  0.
   Running through the usual calculations gives r = 2 5, so |z| = 2 5. To find , we get
   tan() = -2, and since r > 0 and P lies in Quadrant II, we know  is a Quadrant II angle.
   We find  =  + arctan(-2) + 2k, or, more succinctly  =  - arctan(2) + 2k for integers
   k. Hence arg(z) = { - arctan(2) + 2k | k is an integer}. Only  =  - arctan(2) satisfies
   the requirement - <   , so Arg(z) =  - arctan(2).

2In case you're wondering, the use of the absolute value notation |z| for modulus will be explained shortly.
3Recall the symbol being used here, `,' is the mathematical symbol which denotes membership in a set.
4If we had Calculus, we would regard Arg(0) as an `indeterminate form.' But we don't, so we won't.

3. We rewrite z = 3i as z = 0 + 3i to find Re(z) = 0 and Im(z) = 3. The point in the plane

which corresponds to z is (0, 3) and while we could go through the usual calculations to find

the required polar form of this point, we can almost `see' the answer. The point (0, 3) lies 3

units away from the origin on the positive y-axis.  Hence,     r = |z| = 3 and  =     + 2k  for
                                                                                   2
                                                            and Arg(z) = 2 .
integers k. We get arg(z) =  2  +  2k  |k  is  an  integer

4. As in the previous problem, we write z = -117 = -117 + 0i so Re(z) = -117 and Im(z) = 0.
   The number z = -117 corresponds to the point (-117, 0), and this is another instance where
   we can determine the polar form `by eye'. The point (-117, 0) is 117 units away from the
   origin along the negative x-axis. Hence, r = |z| = 117 and  =  + 2 = (2k + 1)k for
   integers k. We have arg(z) = {(2k + 1) | k is an integer}. Only one of these values,  = ,
   just barely lies in the interval (-, ] which means and Arg(z) = . We plot z along with
   the other numbers in this example below.

    z = -2 + 4i                                       Imaginary Axis
z = -117                                       4i
                                               3i z = 3i
                                               2i

                                                i

-117                               -2 -1           1234               Real Axis
                                            -i              

                                                      z = 3-i

Now that we've had some practice computing the modulus and argument of some complex numbers,
it is time to explore their properties. We have the following theorem.

 Theorem 11.14. Properties of the Modulus: Let z and w be complex numbers.

       |z| is the distance from z to 0 in the complex plane
       |z|  0 and |z| = 0 if and only if z = 0
       |z| = Re(z)2 + Im(z)2
       Product Rule: |zw| = |z||w|
       Power Rule: |zn| = |z|n for all natural numbers, n
       Quotient Rule: z = |z| , provided w = 0

                                  w |w|
To prove the first three properties in Theorem 11.14, suppose z = a + bi where a and b are real
numbers. To determine |z|, we find a polar representation (r, ) with r  0 for the point (a, b). From
Section 11.4, we know r2 = a2 + b2 so that r = ± a2 + b2. Since we require r  0, then it must be
that r = a2 + b2, which means |z| = a2 + b2. Using the distance formula, we find the distance
994                                                                         Applications of Trigonometry

from  (0, 0)  to  (a, b)  is  also              establishing    the  first  property.5  For  the  second  property,  note
                                      a2 + b2,

that since |z| is a distance, |z|  0. Furthermore, |z| = 0 if and only if the distance from z to 0 is

0, and the latter happens if and only if z = 0, which is whatwe were asked to show.6 For the third
property, we note that since a = Re(z) and b = Im(z), z = a2 + b2 = Re(z)2 + Im(z)2.

To prove the product rule, suppose z = a + bi and w = c + di for real numbers a, b, c and d. Then
zw = (a + bi)(c + di). After the usual arithmetic7 we get zw = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i. Therefore,

      |zw| = (ac - bd)2 + (ad + bc)2
                  
                  = a2c2 - 2abcd + b2d2 + a2d2 + 2abcd + b2c2 Expand
                  
                  = a2c2 + a2d2 + b2c2 + b2d2                               Rearrange terms

                  = a2 (c2 + d2) + b2 (c2 + d2)                             Factor

                  = (a2 + b2) (c2 + d2)                                     Factor
                                                                            Product Rule for Radicals
                  = a2 + b2 c2 + d2

                  = |z||w|                                                  Definition of |z| and |w|

Hence |zw| = |z||w| as required.

Now that the Product Rule has been established, we use it and the Principle of Mathematical
Induction8 to prove the power rule. Let P (n) be the statement |zn| = |z|n. Then P (1) is true since
 z1 = |z| = |z|1. Next, assume P (k) is true. That is, assume zk = |z|k for some k  1. Our job
is to show that P (k + 1) is true, namely zk+1 = |z|k+1. As is customary with induction proofs,

we first try to reduce the problem in such a way as to use the Induction Hypothesis.

                                    zk+1 = zkz Properties of Exponents
                                              = zk |z| Product Rule
                                              = |z|k|z| Induction Hypothesis
                                              = |z|k+1 Properties of Exponents

Hence, P (k + 1) is true, which means |zn| = |z|n is true for all natural numbers n.
Like the Power Rule, the Quotient Rule can also be established with the help of the Product Rule.
We assume w = 0 (so |w| = 0) and we get

                                      z = (z) 1
                                      w                      w

                                                = |z| 1              Product Rule.
                                                          w

    5Since the absolute value |x| of a real number x can be viewed as the distance from x to 0 on the number line,

this first property justifies the notation |z| for modulus. We leave it to the reader to show that if z is real, then the

definition of modulus coincides with absolute value so the notation |z| is unambiguous.
    6This may be considered by some to be a bit of a cheat, so we work through the underlying Algebra to see this is

true. We know |z| = 0 if and only if a2 + b2 = 0 if and only if a2 + b2 = 0, which is true if and only if a = b = 0.

The latter happens if and only if z = a + bi = 0. There.
    7See Example 3.4.1 in Section 3.4 for a review of complex number arithmetic.
    8See Section 9.3 for a review of this technique.

Hence, the proof really boils down to showing        1  = |w|1 . This is left as an exercise.
                                                     w

Next, we characterize the argument of a complex number in terms of its real and imaginary parts.

Theorem 11.15. Properties of the Argument: Let z be a complex number.

 If Re(z) = 0 and   arg(z), then tan() = Re(z) Im(z) .

 If Re(z) = 0 and Im(z) > 0, then arg(z) =                 +  2k  |k  is  an  integer    .

 If Re(z) = 0 and Im(z) < 0, then arg(z) = - 2 + 2k | k is an integer .

 If Re(z) = Im(z) = 0, then z = 0 and arg(z) = (-, ).

To prove Theorem 11.15, suppose z = a + bi for real numbers a and b. By definition, a = Re(z) and
b = Im(z), so the point associated with z is (a, b) = (Re(z), Im(z)). From Section 11.4, we know
that if (r, ) is a polar representation for (Re(z), Im(z)), then tan() = Re(z) Im(z) , provided Re(z) = 0.
If Re(z) = 0 and Im(z) > 0, then z lies on the positive imaginary axis. Since we take r > 0, we
have that  is coterminal with 2 , and the result follows. If Re(z) = 0 and Im(z) < 0, then z lies
on the negative imaginary axis, and a similar argument shows  is coterminal with - 2 . The last
property in the theorem was already discussed in the remarks following Definition 11.2.

Our next goal is to completely marry the Geometry and the Algebra of the complex numbers. To
that end, consider the figure below.

                                                           Imaginary Axis

                                                              (a, b)  z = a + bi  (r, )

                               bi
                                                                  2 =r

                                                         2 +b
                                                           a

                                                  |z| =

                                             arg(z)           a Real Axis
                               0

Polar coordinates, (r, ) associated with z = a + bi with r  0.

We know from Theorem 11.7 that a = r cos() and b = r sin(). Making these substitutions for a
and b gives z = a + bi = r cos() + r sin()i = r [cos() + i sin()]. The expression `cos() + i sin()'
is abbreviated cis() so we can write z = rcis(). Since r = |z| and   arg(z), we get

Definition 11.3. A Polar Form of a Complex Number: Suppose z is a complex number
and   arg(z). The expression:

                               |z|cis() = |z| [cos() + i sin()]

is called a polar form for z.

Since there are infinitely many choices for   arg(z), there infinitely many polar forms for z, so
we used the indefinite article `a' in Definition 11.3. It is time for an example.

Example 11.7.2.

1. Find the rectangular form of the following complex numbers. Find Re(z) and Im(z).

     (a) z = 4cis  2       (b) z = 2cis - 34             (c) z = 3cis(0)             (d) z = cis         
                   3                                                                                     2

2. Use the results from Example 11.7.1 to find a polar form of the following complex numbers.

                           (b) z = -2 + 4i               (c) z = 3i                  (d) z = -117
     (a) z = 3 - i

Solution.

1. The key to this problem is to write out cis() as cos() + i sin().

     (a) By definition, z = 4cis      2  = 4 cos 23 + i sin 23         . After some simplifying, we get
                                      3

           z = -2 + 2i 3, so that Re(z) = -2 and Im(z) = 2 3.

     (b) Expanding, we get z = 2cis - 34 = 2 cos - 34 + i sin - 34 . From this, we find
                                         
           z = - 2 - i 2, so Re(z) = - 2 = Im(z).

     (c) We get z = 3cis(0) = 3 [cos(0) + i sin(0)] = 3. Writing 3 = 3 + 0i, we get Re(z) = 3 and
          Im(z) = 0, which makes sense seeing as 3 is a real number.

     (d) Lastly, we have z = cis         = cos        + i sin      = i. Since i = 0 + 1i, we get Re(z) = 0
                                      2         2               2

           and Im(z) = 1. Since i is called the `imaginary unit,' these answers make perfect sense.

2. To write a polar form of a complex number z, we need two pieces of information: the modulus
   |z| and an argument (not necessarily the principal argument) of z. We shamelessly mine our
   solution to Example 11.7.1 to find what we need.

     (a) For z = 3 - i, |z| = 2 and  = - 6 , so z = 2cis - 6 . We can check our answer by
                                                                                            
           converting it back to rectangular form to see that it simplifies to z = 3 - i.
                                                                                     
     (b) For z = -2 + 4i, |z| = 2 5 and  =  - arctan(2). Hence, z = 2 5cis( - arctan(2)).

           It is a good exercise to actually show that this polar form reduces to z = -2 + 4i.

     (c) For z = 3i, |z| = 3 and  = 2 . In this case, z = 3cis 2 . This can be checked
                                                                                                      
           geometrically.  Head  out  3  units  from  0  along  the  positive  real  axis.  Rotating  2  radians

           counter-clockwise lands you exactly 3 units above 0 on the imaginary axis at z = 3i.

     (d) Last but not least, for z = -117, |z| = 117 and  = . We get z = 117cis(). As with
          the previous problem, our answer is easily checked geometrically.
11.7 Polar Form of Complex Numbers                                                                      997

The following theorem summarizes the advantages of working with complex numbers in polar form.

 Theorem 11.16. Products, Powers and Quotients Complex Numbers in Polar Form:
 Suppose z and w are complex numbers with polar forms z = |z|cis() and w = |w|cis(). Then

       Product Rule: zw = |z||w|cis( + )
       Power Rule (DeMoivre's Theorem) : zn = |z|ncis(n) for every natural number n
       Quotient Rule: z = |z| cis( - ), provided |w| = 0

                                 w |w|

The proof of Theorem 11.16 requires a healthy mix of definition, arithmetic and identities. We first
start with the product rule.

                               zw = [|z|cis()] [|w|cis()]
                                      = |z||w| [cos() + i sin()] [cos() + i sin()]

We now focus on the quantity in brackets on the right hand side of the equation.

[cos() + i sin()] [cos() + i sin()] = cos() cos() + i cos() sin()
                                                      + i sin() cos() + i2 sin() sin()

            = cos() cos() + i2 sin() sin() Rearranging terms
                 + i sin() cos() + i cos() sin()

            = (cos() cos() - sin() sin()) Since i2 = -1
                 + i (sin() cos() + cos() sin()) Factor out i

            = cos( + ) + i sin( + )                                                     Sum identities

            = cis( + )                                                                  Definition of `cis'

Putting this together with our earlier work, we get zw = |z||w|cis( + ), as required.

Moving right along, we next take aim at the Power Rule, better known as DeMoivre's Theorem.9
We proceed by induction on n. Let P (n) be the sentence zn = |z|ncis(n). Then P (1) is true, since
z1 = z = |z|cis() = |z|1cis(1 · ). We now assume P (k) is true, that is, we assume zk = |z|kcis(k)
for some k  1. Our goal is to show that P (k + 1) is true, or that zk+1 = |z|k+1cis((k + 1)). We
have

zk+1 = zkz                          Properties of Exponents

= |z|kcis(k) (|z|cis()) Induction Hypothesis

= |z|k|z| cis(k + ) Product Rule

= |z|k+1cis((k + 1))

9Compare this proof with the proof of the Power Rule in Theorem 11.14.
998                                             Applications of Trigonometry

Hence, assuming P (k) is true, we have that P (k + 1) is true, so by the Principle of Mathematical
Induction, zn = |z|ncis(n) for all natural numbers n.

The last property in Theorem 11.16 to prove is the quotient rule. Assuming |w| = 0 we have

                                 z = |z|cis()
                                 w    |w|cis()

                                      = |z| cos() + i sin()
                                             |w| cos() + i sin()

Next, we multiply both the numerator and denominator of the right hand side by (cos() - i sin())
which is the complex conjugate of (cos() + i sin()) to get

                 z=              |z| cos() + i sin() · cos() - i sin()
                 w               |w| cos() + i sin() cos() - i sin()

If we let the numerator be N = [cos() + i sin()] [cos() - i sin()] and simplify we get

N = [cos() + i sin()] [cos() - i sin()]

     = cos() cos() - i cos() sin() + i sin() cos() - i2 sin() sin() Expand

     = [cos() cos() + sin() sin()] + i [sin() cos() - cos() sin()] Rearrange and Factor

     = cos( - ) + i sin( - )                                            Difference Identities

     = cis( - )                                                         Definition of `cis'

If we call the denominator D then we get

     D = [cos() + i sin()] [cos() - i sin()]

     = cos2() - i cos() sin() + i cos() sin() - i2 sin2() Expand

     = cos2() - i2 sin2()                                         Simplify

     = cos2() + sin2()                                            Again, i2 = -1

     =1                                                           Pythagorean Identity

Putting it all together, we get

                 z=              |z| cos() + i sin() · cos() - i sin()
                 w               |w| cos() + i sin() cos() - i sin()

                 = |z| cis( - )
                                 |w|      1

                 = |z| cis( - )
                      |w|

and we are done. The next example makes good use of Theorem 11.16.

Solution. In order to use Theorem 11.16, we need to write z and w in polar form. For z = 2 3+2i,
we find |z| = (23)2 + (2)2 = 16 = 4. If   arg(z), we know tan() = Im(z) Re(z) = 22 3 3 = 3 . Since

                                              
z lies in Quadrant I, we have  = 6 + 2k for integers k. Hence, z = 4cis 6 . For w = -1 + i 3,
we have |w| = (-1)2 + (3)2  = 2. For an argument  of w, we have tan() = 3  -1 = - 3. Since

w  lies  in  Quadrant    II,    =   2   +   2k  for  integers        k  and  w  =    2cis  2    . We can now proceed.
                                    3                                                      3

   1. We get zw =             4cis          2cis 23  = 8cis 6 + 23 = 8cis 56 = 8 cos 56 + i sin 56 .
                                    6

         After simplifying, we get zw = -4 3 + 4i.

   2. We use DeMoivre's Theorem which yields w5 =                               2cis    2    5 = 25cis 5 · 23     = 32cis 10 3 .
                                                                                        3                                 
                10                          43 , we get w5 = 32                      4              4     = -16 - 16i 3.
         Since   3     is coterminal with                                    cos     3     + i sin  3

                                                 z     4cis    (     )       4        2                                    
   3. Last, but not least, we have = 2 = 2 cis 6 - 3 = 2cis - 2 . Since - 2 is a6

                                                w      2cis  (3)

         quadrantal angle, we can `see' the rectangular form by moving out 2 units along the positive

         real  axis,   then   rotating      radians    clockwise        to   arrive   at   the  point  2  units  below  0  on  the
                                         2
                                                                             z
         imaginary     axis.  The   long   and  short  of  it  is    that    w  =  -2i.

Some remarks are in order. First, the reader may not be sold on using the polar form of complex

numbers to multiply complex numbers - especially if they aren't given in polar form to begin with.

Indeed, a lot of work was needed to convert the numbers z and w in Example 11.7.3 into polar form,

compute their product, and convert backto rectangular form - certainly more work than is required
to multiply out zw = (2 3 + 2i)(-1 + i 3) the old-fashioned way. However, Theorem 11.16 pays

huge dividends when computing powers of complex numbers. Consider how we computed w5 above

and compare that to using the Binomial Theorem, Theorem 9.4, to accomplish the same feat by
expanding (-1 + i 3)5. Division is tricky in the best of times, and we saved ourselves a lot of

time  and      effort  using  Theorem     11.16  to  find  and       simplify     z   using  their  polar  forms  as  opposed  to
                                                                                  w

starting with 2 3+2i , rationalizing the denominator, and so forth.
                -1+i 3

There is geometric reason for studying these polar forms and we would be derelict in our duties if

we did not mention the Geometry hidden in Theorem 11.16. Take the product rule, for instance. If

z = |z|cis() and w = |w|cis(), the formula zw = |z||w|cis( + ) can be viewed geometrically as

a two step process. The multiplication of |z| by |w| can be interpreted as magnifying10 the distance

|z| from z to 0, by the factor |w|. Adding the argument of w to the argument of z can be interpreted

geometrically as a rotation of  radians counter-clockwise.11 Focusing on z and w from Example

11.7.3, we can arrive at the product zw by plotting z, doubling its distance from 0 (since |w| = 2),

and  rotating    2  radians      counter-clockwise.       The  sequence     of  diagrams         below  attempts    to   describe

Our last goal of the section is to reverse DeMoivre's Theorem to extract roots of complex numbers.

Definition 11.4. Let z and w be complex numbers. If there is a natural number n such that
wn = z, then w is an nth root of z.

Unlike Definition 5.4 in Section 5.3, we do not specify one particular prinicpal nth root, hence the
use of the indefinite article `an' as in `an nth root of z'. Using this definition, both 4 and -4 are

12Again, assuming |w| > 1.
13Again, assuming  > 0.
11.7 Polar Form of Complex Numbers                                                             1001

                                                                                  
square roots of 16, while 16 means the principal square root of 16 as in 16 = 4. Suppose we

wish to find all complex third (cube) roots of 8. Algebraically, we are trying to solve w3 = 8. We
know that there is only one real solution to this equation, namely w = 3 8 = 2, but if we take the

time to rewrite this equation as w3 - 8 = 0 and factor, we get (w - 2) w2 + 2w + 4 = 0. The
                                                                         

quadratic factor gives two more cube roots w = -1 ± i 3, for a total of three cube roots of 8. In

accordance with Theorem 3.14, since the degree of p(w) = w3 - 8 is three, there are three complex

zeros, counting multiplicity. Since we have found three distinct zeros, we know these are all of the

zeros, so there are exactly three distinct cube roots of 8. Let us now solve this same problem using

the machinery developed in this section. To do so, we express z = 8 in polar form. Since z = 8 lies

8 units away on the positive real axis, we get z = 8cis(0). If we let w = |w|cis() be a polar form

of w, the equation w3 = 8 becomes

                                       w3 = 8
                            (|w|cis())3 = 8cis(0)
                            |w|3cis(3) = 8cis(0) DeMoivre's Theorem

The complex number on the left hand side of the equation corresponds to the point with polar

coordinates |w|3, 3 , while the complex number on the right hand side corresponds to the point

with polar coordinates (8, 0). Since |w|  0, so is |w|3, which means |w|3, 3 and (8, 0) are

two polar representations corresponding to the same complex number, both with positive r values.

From Section 11.4, we know |w|3 = 8 and 3 = 0 + 2k for integers k. Since |w| is a real number,
we solve |w|3 = 8 by extracting the principal cube root to get |w| = 3 8 = 2. As for , we get

  =  2k  for  integers  k.  This  produces  three  distinct  points  with  polar  coordinates  corresponding  to
      3
k = 0, 1 and 2: specifically (2, 0), 2, 23 and 2, 43 . These correspond to the complex numbers
                            2                      4
w0 = 2cis(0), w1 = 2cis     3     and w2 = 2cis    3  , respectively.  Writing these out in rectangular form
                                                      
yields w0 = 2, w1 = -1 + i 3 and w2 = -1 - i 3. While this process seems a tad more involved

than our previous factoring approach, this procedure can be generalized to find, for example, all of

the fifth roots of 32. (Try using Chapter 3 techniques on that!) If we start with a generic complex

number in polar form z = |z|cis() and solve wn = z in the same manner as above, we arrive at the

following theorem.

 Theorem 11.17. The nth roots of a Complex Number: Let z = 0 be a complex number
 with polar form z = rcis(). For each natural number n, z has n distinct nth roots, which we
 denote by w0, w1, . . . , wn - 1, and they are given by the formula

                                                wk = n rcis  + 2 k
                                                                   nn

The proof of Theorem 11.17 breaks into to two parts: first, showing that each wk is an nth root, and
second, showing that the set {wk | k = 0, 1, . . . , (n - 1)} consists of n different complex numbers.
To show wk is an nth root of z, we use DeMoivre's Theorem to show (wk)n = z.
1002                                                             Applications of Trigonometry

                   (wk)n = n rcis n + n2 k n                     DeMoivre's Theorem
                             = ( n r)n cis n · n + n2 k
                             = rcis ( + 2k)

Since k is a whole number, cos( + 2k) = cos() and sin( + 2k) = sin(). Hence, it follows that
cis( + 2k) = cis(), so (wk)n = rcis() = z, as required. To show that the formula in Theorem

11.17 generates n distinct numbers, we assume n  2 (ornelse there is nothing to prove) and note
that the modulus of each of the wk is the same, namely r. Therefore, the only way any two of

these polar forms correspond to the same number is if their arguments are coterminal - that is, if

the arguments differ by an integer multiple of 2. Suppose k and j are whole numbers between 0

and (n - 1), inclusive, with k = j. Since k and j are different, let's assume for the sake of argument

that k > j. Then   n + 2n k -      n + 2n j   = 2   k-j  .  For this to be an integer multiple of 2,
                                                     n

(k - j) must be a multiple of n. But because of the restrictions on k and j, 0 < k - j  n - 1.

(Think this through.) Hence, (k - j) is a positive number less than n, so it cannot be a multiple

of n. As a result, wk and wj are different complex numbers, and we are done. By Theorem 3.14,

we know there at most n distinct solutions to wn = z, and we have just found all of them. We

illustrate Theorem 11.17 in the next example.

Example 11.7.4. Use Theorem 11.17 to find the following:
                                                   

   1. both square roots of z = -2 + 2i 3

2. the four fourth roots of z = -16
                                        

3. the three cube roots of z = 2 + i 2

4. the five fifth roots of z = 1.

Solution.

1. We start by writing z = -2 + 2i3 = 4cis 32 . To use Theorem 11.17, we identify r = 4,
           2
        =  3  and  n = 2.  We  know  that  z  has   two  square  roots,  and  in  keeping  with  the  notation
                                                                         
                                                                                  (2/3) 2                    
      in Theorem 11.17, we'll call them w0 and w1. We get w0 = 4cis 2 + 2 (0) = 2cis 3
      and w1 = 4cis 2 (2/3) + 22 (1) = 2cis 34 . In rectangular form, the two square roots of
                                              
      z are w0 = 1 + i 3 and w1 = -1 - i 3. We can check our answers by squaring them and
      showing that we get z = -2 + 2i 3.

2. Proceeding as above, we get z = -16 = 16cis(). With r = 16,  =  and n = 4, we get the
      four fourth roots of z to be w0 =    4 16cis  4 + 24 (0)   = 2cis       , w1 =  4 16cis    4 + 24 (1)  =
      2cis 43 , w2 = 4 16cis 4 + 42 (2) = 2cis 45 and w3 = 4 16cis 4 + 42 (3) = 2cis 47 .4

                                                                                                      
      Convertingtheseto rectangular form gives w0 = 2+i 2, w1 = - 2+i 2, w2 = - 2-i 2
      and w3 = 2 - i 2.
11.7 Polar Form of Complex Numbers                                                                                           1003

3. For z = 2+i2, we have z = 2cis 4 . With r = 2,  = 4 and n = 3 the usual computations
                     3                         3          9       3            3                      3       17
yield w0 = 2cis 12 , w1 = 2cis 12 = 2cis 4 and w2 = 2cis 12 . If we were

to convert these to rectangular form, we would need to use either the Sum and Difference

Identities in Theorem 10.16 or the Half-Angle Identities in Theorem 10.19 to evaluate w0 and

w2. Since we are not explicitly told to do so, we leave this as a good, but messy, exercise.

4. To find the five fifth roots of 1, we write 1 = 1cis(0). We have r = 1,  = 0 and n = 5.
Since         5 1 = 1, the roots are w0 = cis(0) = 1, w1 = cis                     2     , w2 = cis      4    , w3 = cis  6    and
                                                                                   5                     5                5
                  8
w4 = cis          5  . The situation here is even graver than in the previous example, since we have

not developed any identities to help us determine the cosine or sine of 25 . At this stage, we

could approximate our answers using a calculator, and we leave this as an exercise.

Now that we have done some computations using Theorem 11.17, we take a step back to look

at things geometrically. Essentially, Theorem 11.17 says that to find the nth roots of a complex

number, we first take the nth root of the modulus and divide the argument by n. This gives the

first root w0.    Each  succeessive     root   is     found   by  adding       2   to the argument, which amounts to
                                                                               n
                  2
rotating  w0  by  n  radians.   This    results       in  n   roots,   spaced  equally   around       the     complex  plane.  As

an example of this, we plot our answers to number 2 in Example 11.7.4 below.

We have only glimpsed at the beauty of the complex numbers in this section. The complex plane
is without a doubt one of the most important mathematical constructs ever devised. Coupled with
Calculus, it is the venue for incredibly important Science and Engineering applications.14 For now,
the following exercises will have to suffice.

79. According to Theorem 3.16 in Section 3.4, the polynomial p(x) = x4 + 4 can be factored
     into the product linear and irreducible quadratic factors. In Exercise 28 in Section 8.7, we
     showed you how to factor this polynomial into the product of two irreducible quadratic factors
     using a system of non-linear equations. Now that we can compute the complex fourth roots
     of -4 directly, we can simply apply the Complex Factorization Theorem, Theorem 3.14, to
     obtain the linear factorization p(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))(x - (-1 + i))(x - (-1 - i)).
     By multiplying the first two factors together and then the second two factors together, thus
     pairing up the complex conjugate pairs of zeros Theorem 3.15 told us we'd get, we have
     that p(x) = (x2 - 2x + 2)(x2 + 2x + 2). Use the 12 complex 12th roots of 4096 to factor
     p(x) = x12 - 4096 into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors.

           that wj = cis(2 - ) is indeed an nth root of unity.

83. Another way to express the polar form of a complex number is to use the exponential function.
     For real numbers t, Euler's Formula defines eit = cos(t) + i sin(t).

11.8 Vectors

As we have seen numerous times in this book, Mathematics can be used to model and solve
real-world problems. For many applications, real numbers suffice; that is, real numbers with the
appropriate units attached can be used to answer questions like "How close is the nearest Sasquatch
nest?" There are other times though, when these kinds of quantities do not suffice. Perhaps it is
important to know, for instance, how close the nearest Sasquatch nest is as well as the direction in
which it lies. (Foreshadowing the use of bearings in the exercises, perhaps?) To answer questions
like these which involve both a quantitative answer, or magnitude, along with a direction, we use
the mathematical objects called vectors.1 A vector is represented geometrically as a directed line
segment where the magnitude of the vector is taken to be the length of the line segment and the
direction is made clear with the use of an arrow at one endpoint of the segment. When referring to
vectors in this text, we shall adopt2 the `arrow' notation, so the symbol v is read as `the vector v'.
Below is a typical vector v with endpoints P (1, 2) and Q (4, 6). The point P is called the initial
point or tail of v and the point Q is called the terminal point or head of v. Since we can reconstruct

                                                         --
v completely from P and Q, we write v = P Q, where the order of points P (initial point) and Q
(terminal point) is important. (Think about this before moving on.)

                         Q (4, 6)

      P (1, 2)

                     --
                v = PQ

While it is true that P and Q completely determine v, it is important to note that since vectors are
defined in terms of their two characteristics, magnitude and direction, any directed line segment
with the same length and direction as v is considered to be the same vector as v, regardless of its
initial point. In the case of our vector v above, any vector which moves three units to the right
and four up3 from its initial point to arrive at its terminal point is considered the same vector as v.
The notation we use to capture this idea is the component form of the vector, v = 3, 4 , where the
first number, 3, is called the x-component of v and the second number, 4, is called the y-component
of v. If we wanted to reconstruct v = 3, 4 with initial point P (-2, 3), then we would find the
terminal point of v by adding 3 to the x-coordinate and adding 4 to the y-coordinate to obtain the
terminal point Q (1, 7), as seen below.

    1The word `vector' comes from the Latin vehere meaning `to convey' or `to carry.'
    2Other textbook authors use bold vectors such as v. We find that writing in bold font on the chalkboard is
inconvenient at best, so we have chosen the `arrow' notation.
    3If this idea of `over' and `up' seems familiar, it should. The slope of the line segment containing v is 34 .

              v = 3, 4 with initial point P (-2, 3).

The component form of a vector is what ties these very geometric objects back to Algebra and
ultimately Trigonometry. We generalize our example in our definition below.

 Definition 11.5. Suppose v is represented by a directed line segment with initial point P (x0, y0)
 and terminal point Q (x1, y1). The component form of v is given by

                                                    --
                                              v = P Q = x1 - x0, y1 - y0

Using the language of components, we have that two vectors are equal if and only if their corre-
sponding components are equal. That is, v1, v2 = v1, v2 if and only if v1 = v1 and v2 = v2.
(Again, think about this before reading on.) We now set about defining operations on vectors.
Suppose we are given two vectors v and w. The sum, or resultant vector v + w is obtained as
follows. First, plot v. Next, plot w so that its initial point is the terminal point of v. To plot the
vector v + w we begin at the initial point of v and end at the terminal point of w. It is helpful to
think of the vector v + w as the `net result' of moving along v then moving along w.

                                                  w
                         v+w

                                                                                    v

                                                                             v, w, and v + w

Our next example makes good use of resultant vectors and reviews bearings and the Law of Cosines.4

Example 11.8.1. A plane leaves an airport with an airspeed5 of 175 miles per hour at a bearing
of N40E. A 35 mile per hour wind is blowing at a bearing of S60E. Find the true speed of the
plane, rounded to the nearest mile per hour, and the true bearing of the plane, rounded to the
nearest degree.

    4If necessary, review page 905 and Section 11.3.
    5That is, the speed of the plane relative to the air around it. If there were no wind, plane's airspeed would be the
same as its speed as observed from the ground. How does wind affect this? Keep reading!

Solution: For both the plane and the wind, we are given their speeds and their directions. Coupling
speed (as a magnitude) with direction is the concept of velocity which we've seen a few times before
in this textbook.6 We let v denote the plane's velocity and w denote the wind's velocity in the
diagram below. The `true' speed and bearing is found by analyzing the resultant vector, v + w.
From the vector diagram, we get a triangle, the lengths of whose sides are the magnitude of v,
which is 175, the magnitude of w, which is 35, and the magnitude of v + w, which we'll call c.
From the given bearing information, we go through the usual geometry to determine that the angle
between the sides of length 35 and 175 measures 100.

          N                       v                                            N
               40                          v+w                                                                       35

                                                                                                             100

                                                                                   175

                                                                                               c

                                                                               40

                                                    E                                                                    E
                 w                                                             60
          60

From the Law of Cosines, we determine c = 31850 - 12250 cos(100)  184, which means the

true speed of the plane is (approximately) 184 miles per hour. To determine the true bearing

of the plane, we need to determine the angle . Using the Law of Cosines once more,7 we find
          c2+29400
cos()  =     350c   so  that      11.  Given           the  geometry  of  the  situation,  we  add    to  the               given  40

and find the true bearing of the plane to be (approximately) N51E.

Our next step is to define addition of vectors component-wise to match the geometric action.8

Definition 11.6. Suppose v = v1, v2 and w = w1, w2 . The vector v + w is defined by

                                               v + w = v1 + w1, v2 + w2

                                                                    --
Example 11.8.2. Let v = 3, 4 and suppose w = P Q where P (-3, 7) and Q(-2, 5). Find v + w
and interpret this sum geometrically.

Solution. Before can add the vectors using Definition 11.6, we need to write w in component form.
Using Definition 11.5, we get w = -2 - (-3), 5 - 7 = 1, -2 . Thus

    6See Section 10.1.1, for instance.
    7Or, since our given angle, 100, is obtuse, we could use the Law of Sines without any ambiguity here.
    8Adding vectors `component-wise' should seem hauntingly familiar. Compare this with how matrix addition was
defined in section 8.3. In fact, in more advanced courses such as Linear Algebra, vectors are defined as 1 × n or n × 1
matrices, depending on the situation.
11.8 Vectors                                   1015

              v+w =           3, 4 + 1, -2
                        =     3 + 1, 4 + (-2)
                        =     4, 2

To visualize this sum, we draw v with its initial point at (0, 0) (for convenience) so that its terminal
point is (3, 4). Next, we graph w with its initial point at (3, 4). Moving one to the right and two
down, we find the terminal point of w to be (4, 2). We see that the vector v + w has initial point
(0, 0) and terminal point (4, 2) so its component form is 4, 2 , as required.

In order for vector addition to enjoy the same kinds of properties as real number addition, it is
necessary to extend our definition of vectors to include a `zero vector', 0 = 0, 0 . Geometrically,
0 represents a point, which we can think of as a directed line segment with the same initial and
terminal points. The reader may well object to the inclusion of 0, since after all, vectors are supposed
to have both a magnitude (length) and a direction. While it seems clear that the magnitude of
0 should be 0, it is not clear what its direction is. As we shall see, the direction of 0 is in fact
undefined, but this minor hiccup in the natural flow of things is worth the benefits we reap by
including 0 in our discussions. We have the following theorem.

 Theorem 11.18. Properties of Vector Addition

       Commutative Property: For all vectors v and w, v + w = w + v.

       Associative Property: For all vectors u, v and w, (u + v) + w = u + (v + w).

       Identity Property: The vector 0 acts as the additive identity for vector addition. That
         is, for all vectors v,
                                                        v + 0 = 0 + v = v.

       Inverse Property: Every vector v has a unique additive inverse, denoted -v. That is,
         for every vector v, there is a vector -v so that

                                                   v + (-v) = (-v) + v = 0.
1016                   Applications of Trigonometry

The properties in Theorem 11.18 are easily verified using the definition of vector addition.9 For
the commutative property, we note that if v = v1, v2 and w = w1, w2 then

                                             v + w = v1, v2 + w1, w2
                                                        = v1 + w1, v2 + w2
                                                        = w1 + v1, w2 + v2
                                                        = w+v

Geometrically, we can `see' the commutative property by realizing that the sums v + w and w + v
are the same directed diagonal determined by the parallelogram below.

      v
                    w

                                                                                     v

                        Demonstrating the commutative property of vector addition.

The proofs of the associative and identity properties proceed similarly, and the reader is encouraged
to verify them and provide accompanying diagrams. The existence and uniqueness of the additive
inverse is yet another property inherited from the real numbers. Given a vector v = v1, v2 , suppose
we wish to find a vector w = w1, w2 so that v + w = 0. By the definition of vector addition, we
have v1 + w1, v2 + w2 = 0, 0 , and hence, v1 + w1 = 0 and v2 + w2 = 0. We get w1 = -v1 and
w2 = -v2 so that w = -v1, -v2 . Hence, v has an additive inverse, and moreover, it is unique
and can be obtained by the formula -v = -v1, -v2 . Geometrically, the vectors v = v1, v2 and
-v = -v1, -v2 have the same length, but opposite directions. As a result, when adding the
vectors geometrically, the sum v + (-v) results in starting at the initial point of v and ending back
at the initial point of v, or in other words, the net result of moving v then -v is not moving at all.

      v
                   -v

Using the additive inverse of a vector, we can define the difference of two vectors, v - w = v + (-w).
If v = v1, v2 and w = w1, w2 then

    9The interested reader is encouraged to compare Theorem 11.18 and the ensuing discussion with Theorem 8.3 in
Section 8.3 and the discussion there.
11.8 Vectors                                                        1017

                                        v - w = v + (-w)
                                                   = v1, v2 + -w1, -w2
                                                   = v1 + (-w1) , v2 + (-w2)
                                                   = v1 - w1, v2 - w2

In other words, like vector addition, vector subtraction works component-wise. To interpret the
vector v - w geometrically, we note

w + (v - w) = w + (v + (-w)) Definition of Vector Subtraction

              = w + ((-w) + v) Commutativity of Vector Addition

              =v                   Definition of Additive Identity

This means that the `net result' of moving along w then moving along v - w is just v itself. From
the diagram below, we see that v - w may be interpreted as the vector whose initial point is the
terminal point of w and whose terminal point is the terminal point of v as depicted below. It is also
worth mentioning that in the parallelogram determined by the vectors v and w, the vector v - w
is one of the diagonals - the other being v + w.

                              v-w                 v
              w                                                  w

                         v                         v-w

                                           v

Next, we discuss scalar multiplication - that is, taking a real number times a vector. We define
scalar multiplication for vectors in the same way we defined it for matrices in Section 8.3.

 Definition 11.7. If k is a real number and v = v1, v2 , we define kv by

                                               kv = k v1, v2 = kv1, kv2

Scalar multiplication by k in vectors can be understood geometrically as scaling the vector (if k > 0)
or scaling the vector and reversing its direction (if k < 0) as demonstrated below.
1018                                                                     Applications of Trigonometry

Note that, by definition 11.7, (-1)v = (-1) v1, v2 = (-1)v1, (-1)v2 = -v1, -v2 = -v. This,
and other properties of scalar multiplication are summarized below.

 Theorem 11.19. Properties of Scalar Multiplication

 Associative Property: For every vector v and scalars k and r, (kr)v = k(rv).

 Identity Property: For all vectors v, 1v = v.

 Additive Inverse Property: For all vectors v, -v = (-1)v.

 Distributive Property of Scalar Multiplication over Scalar Addition:    For every
   vector v and scalars k and r,
                                                 (k + r)v = kv + rv

 Distributive Property of Scalar Multiplication over Vector Addition: For all
   vectors v and w and scalars k,

                                 k(v + w) = kv + kw

 Zero Product Property: If v is vector and k is a scalar, then

                                         kv = 0 if and only if k = 0 or v = 0

The proof of Theorem 11.19, like the proof of Theorem 11.18, ultimately boils down to the definition
of scalar multiplication and properties of real numbers. For example, to prove the associative
property, we let v = v1, v2 . If k and r are scalars then

The remaining properties are proved similarly and are left as exercises.
Our next example demonstrates how Theorem 11.19 allows us to do the same kind of algebraic
manipulations with vectors as we do with variables - multiplication and division of vectors notwith-
standing. If the pedantry seems familiar, it should. This is the same treatment we gave Example
8.3.1 in Section 8.3. As in that example, we spell out the solution in excruciating detail to encourage
the reader to think carefully about why each step is justified.

Example 11.8.3. Solve 5v - 2 (v + 1, -2 ) = 0 for v.

Solution.

              5v - 2 (v + 1, -2 ) = 0

              5v + (-1) [2 (v + 1, -2 )] = 0

              5v + [(-1)(2)] (v + 1, -2 ) = 0

              5v + (-2) (v + 1, -2 ) = 0

              5v + [(-2)v + (-2) 1, -2 ] = 0

              5v + [(-2)v + (-2)(1), (-2)(-2) ] = 0

              [5v + (-2)v] + -2, 4 = 0

              (5 + (-2))v + -2, 4 = 0

              3v + -2, 4 = 0

              (3v + -2, 4 ) + (- -2, 4 ) = 0 + (- -2, 4 )

              3v + [ -2, 4 + (- -2, 4 )] = 0 + (-1) -2, 4

                 3v + 0 = 0 + (-1)(-2), (-1)(4)

A vector whose initial point is (0, 0) is said to be in standard position. If v = v1, v2 is plotted
in standard position, then its terminal point is necessarily (v1, v2). (Once more, think about this
before reading on.)

Plotting a vector in standard position enables us to more easily quantify the concepts of magnitude
and direction of the vector. We can convert the point (v1, v2) in rectangular coordinates to a pair
(r, ) in polar coordinates where r  0. The magnitude of v, which we said earlier was length
of the directed line segment, is r = v21 + v22 and is denoted by v . From Section 11.4, we
know v1 = r cos() = v cos() and v2 = r sin() = v sin(). From the definition of scalar
multiplication and vector equality, we get

                                             v=     v1, v2
                                                 =   v cos(), v sin()
                                                 =  v cos(), sin()

This motivates the following definition.

Definition 11.8. Suppose v is a vector with component form v = v1, v2 . Let (r, ) be a polar
representation of the point with rectangular coordinates (v1, v2) with r  0.

 The magnitude of v, denoted v , is given by v = r = v21 + v22

 If v = 0, the (vector) direction of v, denoted v^ is given by v^ = cos(), sin()

Taken together, we get v = v cos(), v sin() .

A few remarks are in order. First, we note that if v = 0 then even though there are infinitely
many angles  which satisfy Definition 11.8, the stipulation r > 0 means that all of the angles are
coterminal. Hence, if  and  both satisfy the conditions of Definition 11.8, then cos() = cos( )
and sin() = sin( ), and as such, cos(), sin() = cos( ), sin( ) making v^ is well-defined.10 If
v = 0, then v = 0, 0 , and we know from Section 11.4 that (0, ) is a polar representation for
the origin for any angle . For this reason, ^0 is undefined. The following theorem summarizes the
important facts about the magnitude and direction of a vector.

 Theorem 11.20. Properties of Magnitude and Direction: Suppose v is a vector.

 v  0 and v = 0 if and only if v = 0
 For all scalars k, k v = |k| v .

 If v = 0 then v = v v^, so that v^ =               1  v.
                                                    v

The proof of the first property in Theorem 11.20 is a direct consequence of the definition of v .
If v = v1, v2 , then v = v21 + v22 which is by definition greater than or equal to 0. Moreover,

   v21 + v22 = 0 if and only of v21 + v22 = 0 if and only if v1 = v2 = 0. Hence, v = 0 if and only if
v = 0, 0 = 0, as required.

The second property is a result of the definition of magnitude and scalar multiplication along with
a propery of radicals. If v = v1, v2 and k is a scalar then

  10If this all looks familiar, it should. The interested reader is invited to compare Definition 11.8 to Definition 11.2
in Section 11.7.

                 = |k| v

The equation v = v v^ in Theorem 11.20 is a consequence of the definitions of v and v^ and was

worked out in the discussion just prior to Definition 11.8 on page 1020. In words, the equation

v = v v^ says that any given vector is the product of its magnitude and its direction - an important

concept to keep in mind when studying and using vectors. The equation v^ =              1  v is a result of
                                                                                        v

solving v =  v v^ for v^ by multiplying11 both sides of the equation by  1  and using the properties
                                                                         v
of Theorem 11.19. We are overdue for an example.

Example 11.8.4.

1. Find the component form of the vector v with v = 5 so that when v is plotted in standard
   position, it lies in Quadrant II and makes a 60 angle12 with the negative x-axis.
                       

2. For v = 3, -3 3 , find v and , 0   < 2 so that v = v cos(), sin() .

3. For the vectors v = 3, 4 and w = 1, -2 , find the following.

(a) v^             (b) v - 2 w                    (c) v - 2w                        (d) w^

Solution.

1. We are told that v = 5 and are given information about its direction, so we can use the

formula v = v v^ to get the component form of v. To determine v^, we appeal to Definition

11.8. We are told that v lies in Quadrant II and makes a 60 angle with the negative x-axis,

so the polar form of the terminal point of v, when plotted in standard position is (5, 120).
                                                                                    
                                                                            - 12 ,   3
(See the diagram below.) Thus v^ = cos (120) , sin (120) =                          2   , so v =  v v^ =

                 
5 - 12 , 32 = - 52 , 5 3 2 .

11Of course, to go from v = v v^ to v^ =  1  v, we are essentially `dividing both sides' of the equation by the
                                          v

scalar v . The authors encourage the reader, however, to work out the details carefully to gain an appreciation of

the properties in play.
  12Due to the utility of vectors in `real-world' applications, we will usually use degree measure for the angle when

giving the vector's direction. However, since Carl doesn't want you to forget about radians, he's made sure there are

examples and exercises which use them.

      (3, -3 3) is a point in Quadrant IV,  is a Quadrant IV angle. Hence, we pick  = 3 . We
                                                               5         5
      may check our answer by verifying v =  3, -3 3  =6  cos  3  , sin  3  .

3. (a) Since we are given the component form of v, we'll use the formula v^ =      1  v. For
                                                                                   v

      v = 3, 4 , we have v = 3 + 4 = 25 = 5. Hence, v^ = 5 3, 4 = 5 , 5 .

      (b) We know from our work above that v = 5, so to find v -2 w , we need only find w .
           Since w = 1, -2 , we get w = 12 + (-2)2 = 5. Hence, v - 2 w = 5 - 2 5.

      (c) In the expression v -2w , notice that the arithmetic on the vectors comes first, then the

           magnitude. Hence, our first step is to find the component form of the vector v - 2w. We
           get v - 2w = 3, 4 - 2 1, -2 = 1, 8 . Hence, v - 2w = 1, 8 = 12 + 82 = 65.
      (d) To find w^ , we first need w^. Using the formula w^ = w1 w along with w = 5,

      which we found the in the previous problem, we get w^ = 1 1, -2 = 1 , - 2 =
                                                                     5             5  5

                                  5 2               25 2       5 + 20 = 1 = 1.
      55 , - 2 5 5 . Hence, w^ =
                                  5 + -5 =                     25 25

The process exemplified by number 1 in Example 11.8.4 above by which we take information about
the magnitude and direction of a vector and find the component form of a vector is called resolving
a vector into its components. As an application of this process, we revisit Example 11.8.1 below.

Example 11.8.5. A plane leaves an airport with an airspeed of 175 miles per hour with bearing
N40E. A 35 mile per hour wind is blowing at a bearing of S60E. Find the true speed of the plane,
rounded to the nearest mile per hour, and the true bearing of the plane, rounded to the nearest
degree.
Solution: We proceed as we did in Example 11.8.1 and let v denote the plane's velocity and w
denote the wind's velocity, and set about determining v + w. If we regard the airport as being
11.8 Vectors                                                                              1023

at the origin, the positive y-axis acting as due north and the positive x-axis acting as due east,

we see that the vectors v and w are in standard position and their directions correspond to the
angles 50 and -30, respectively. Hence, the component form of v = 175 cos(50), sin(50) =
 175 cos(50), 175 sin(50) and the component form of w = 35 cos(-30), 35 sin(-30) . Since we
have no convenient way to express the exact values of cosine and sine of 50, we leave both vectors
in terms of cosines and sines.13 Adding corresponding components, we find the resultant vector
v + w = 175 cos(50) + 35 cos(-30), 175 sin(50) + 35 sin(-30) . To find the `true' speed of the

plane, we compute the magnitude of this resultant vector

v + w = (175 cos(50) + 35 cos(-30))2 + (175 sin(50) + 35 sin(-30))2  184

Hence, the `true' speed of the plane is approximately 184 miles per hour. To find the true bear-

ing, we need to find the angle  which corresponds to the polar form (r, ), r > 0, of the point
(x, y) = (175 cos(50) + 35 cos(-30), 175 sin(50) + 35 sin(-30)). Since both of these coordinates
are positive,14 we know  is a Quadrant I angle, as depicted below. Furthermore,

                                     y 175 sin(50) + 35 sin(-30)
                tan() = =                     ,
                                     x 175 cos(50 ) + 35 cos(-30 )

so using the arctangent function, we get   39. Since, for the purposes of bearing, we need the

angle between v +w and the positive y-axis, we take the complement of  and find the `true' bearing
of the plane to be approximately N51E.

If v is a unit vector, then necessarily, v = v v^ = 1 · v^ = v^. Conversely, we leave it as an exercise15

to show that v^ =  1  v is a unit vector for any nonzero vector v. In practice, if v is a unit
                   v

vector we write it as v^ as opposed to v because we have reserved the `^' notation for unit vectors.

The process of multiplying a nonzero vector by the factor    1  to produce a unit vector is called

`normalizing the vector,' and the resulting vector v^ is called the `unit vector in the direction of

v'. The terminal points of unit vectors, when plotted in standard position, lie on the Unit Circle.

(You should take the time to show this.) As a result, we visualize normalizing a nonzero vector v
as shrinking16 its terminal point, when plotted in standard position, back to the Unit Circle.

Of all of the unit vectors, two deserve special mention.

Definition 11.10. The Principal Unit Vectors:

       The vector ^i is defined by ^i = 1, 0

       The vector ^ is defined by ^i = 0, 1

We can think of the vector ^i as representing the positive x-direction, while ^ represents the positive
y-direction. We have the following `decomposition' theorem.17

 Theorem 11.21. Principal Vector Decomposition Theorem: Let v be a vector with
 component form v = v1, v2 . Then v = v1^i + v2^.

The proof of Theorem 11.21 is straightforward. Since ^i = 1, 0 and ^ = 0, 1 , we have from the
definition of scalar multiplication and vector addition that

                        v1^i + v2^ = v1 1, 0 + v2 0, 1 = v1, 0 + 0, v2 = v1, v2 = v                1  v . Use
                                                                                                   v
  15One proof uses the properties of scalar multiplication and magnitude. If v = 0, consider v^ =
the fact that v  0 is a scalar and consider factoring.

We conclude this section with a classic example which demonstrates how vectors are used to model
forces. A `force' is defined as a `push' or a `pull.' The intensity of the push or pull is the magnitude
of the force, and is measured in Netwons (N) in the SI system or pounds (lbs.) in the English
system.18 The following example uses all of the concepts in this section, and should be studied in
great detail.

Example 11.8.6. A 50 pound speaker is suspended from the ceiling by two support braces. If one
of them makes a 60 angle with the ceiling and the other makes a 30 angle with the ceiling, what
are the tensions on each of the supports?
Solution. We represent the problem schematically below and then provide the corresponding
vector diagram.

                                                                                                  T2
                                                                                                            60
                                                                                                    30

    50 lbs.                                                                                             w

We have three forces acting on the speaker: the weight of the speaker, which we'll call w, pulling
the speaker directly downward, and the forces on the support rods, which we'll call T1 and T2
(for `tensions') acting upward at angles 60 and 30, respectively. We are looking for the tensions
on the support, which are the magnitudes T1 and T2 . In order for the speaker to remain
stationary,19 we require w + T1 + T2 = 0. Viewing the common initial point of these vectors as the

  18See also Section 11.1.1.
  19This is the criteria for `static equilbrium'.
1026                                                           Applications of Trigonometry

origin and the dashed line as the x-axis, we use Theorem 11.20 to get component representations
for the three vectors involved. We can model the weight of the speaker as a vector pointing directly
downwards with a magnitude of 50 pounds. That is, w = 50 and w^ = -^ = 0, -1 . Hence,
w = 50 0, -1 = 0, -50 . For the force in the first support, we get

                           T1 =    T1 cos (60) , sin (60)
                                =
                                                      
                                      T1 , T1 3
                                      2            2

For the second support, we note that the angle 30 is measured from the negative x-axis, so the
angle needed to write T2 in component form is 150. Hence

                           T2 =    T2 cos (150) , sin (150)
                                =
                                              
                                   - T2 3 , T2
                                           2          2

The requirement w + T1 + T2 = 0 gives us this vector equation.

                                                         w + T1 + T2 = 0

                            T1 ,                            
                             2     T1 3    + - T2 3 , T2
      0, -50 +             T1 -                          2      2          = 0, 0
                           2         2                                     = 0, 0
                                                   
                                           T1 3 + T2 - 50
                                   T2 3 ,       2           2
                                      2

Equating the corresponding components of the vectors on each side, we get a system of linear
equations in the variables T1 and T2 .

                                                         
                 (E1)                      T1 - T2 3 = 0
                 (E2)                 2 2
                                   T1 3 + T2 - 50 = 0
                                   2               2

                                                                                        3+
                                                                           (  T2    3)      T2
From (E1), we get T1 = T2    3.   Substituting  that  into    (E2)  gives         2         2   - 50 = 0
                                                                                        
which yields 2 T2 - 50 = 0. Hence, T2 = 25 pounds and T1 = T2 3 = 25 3 pounds.

61. Two drunken college students have filled an empty beer keg with rocks and tied ropes to it in
     order to drag it down the street in the middle of the night. The stronger of the two students
     pulls with a force of 100 pounds at a heading of N77E and the other pulls at a heading of
     S68E. What force should the weaker student apply to his rope so that the keg of rocks heads
     due east? What resultant force is applied to the keg? Round your answer to the nearest
     pound.

62. Emboldened by the success of their late night keg pull in Exercise 61 above, our intrepid young
     scholars have decided to pay homage to the chariot race scene from the movie `Ben-Hur' by
     tying three ropes to a couch, loading the couch with all but one of their friends and pulling
     it due west down the street. The first rope points N80W, the second points due west and
     the third points S80W. The force applied to the first rope is 100 pounds, the force applied
     to the second rope is 40 pounds and the force applied (by the non-riding friend) to the third
     rope is 160 pounds. They need the resultant force to be at least 300 pounds otherwise the
     couch won't move. Does it move? If so, is it heading due west?

63. Let v = v1, v2 be any non-zero vector. Show that 1 v has length 1.

64. We say that two non-zero vectors v and w are parallel if they have same or opposite directions.
     That is, v = 0 and w = 0 are parallel if either v^ = w^ or v^ = -w^. Show that this means
     v = kw for some non-zero scalar k and that k > 0 if the vectors have the same direction and
     k < 0 if they point in opposite directions.

65. The goal of this exercise is to use vectors to describe non-vertical lines in the plane. To that
     end, consider the line y = 2x - 4. Let v0 = 0, -4 and let s = 1, 2 . Let t be any real
     number. Show that the vector defined by v = v0 + ts, when drawn in standard position, has
     its terminal point on the line y = 2x - 4. (Hint: Show that v0 + ts = t, 2t - 4 for any real
     number t.) Now consider the non-vertical line y = mx + b. Repeat the previous analysis with
     v0 = 0, b and let s = 1, m . Thus any non-vertical line can be thought of as a collection of
     terminal points of the vector sum of 0, b (the position vector of the y-intercept) and a scalar
     multiple of the slope vector s = 1, m .

11.9 The Dot Product and Projection

In Section 11.8, we learned how add and subtract vectors and how to multiply vectors by scalars.
In this section, we define a product of vectors. We begin with the following definition.

 Definition 11.11. Suppose v and w are vectors whose component forms are v = v1, v2 and
 w = w1, w2 . The dot product of v and w is given by

                                       v · w = v1, v2 · w1, w2 = v1w1 + v2w2

For example, let v = 3, 4 and w = 1, -2 . Then v · w = 3, 4 · 1, -2 = (3)(1) + (4)(-2) = -5.
Note that the dot product takes two vectors and produces a scalar. For that reason, the quantity
v·w is often called the scalar product of v and w. The dot product enjoys the following properties.

 Theorem 11.22. Properties of the Dot Product

       Commutative Property: For all vectors v and w, v · w = w · v.

       Distributive Property: For all vectors u, v and w, u · (v + w) = u · v + u · w.

       Scalar Property: For all vectors v and w and scalars k, (kv) · w = k(v · w) = v · (kw).

       Relation to Magnitude: For all vectors v, v · v = v 2.
Like most of the theorems involving vectors, the proof of Theorem 11.22 amounts to using the
definition of the dot product and properties of real number arithmetic. To show the commutative
property for instance, let v = v1, v2 and w = w1, w2 . Then

      v · w = v1, v2 · w1, w2    Definition of Dot Product
              = v1w1 + v2w2      Commutativity of Real Number Multiplication
              = w1v1 + w2v2      Definition of Dot Product
              = w1, w2 · v1, v2
              = w·v

The distributive property is proved similarly and is left as an exercise.
For the scalar property, assume that v = v1, v2 and w = w1, w2 and k is a scalar. Then

      (kv) · w = (k v1, v2 ) · w1, w2

      = kv1, kv2 · w1, w2              Definition of Scalar Multiplication

      = (kv1)(w1) + (kv2)(w2) Definition of Dot Product

      = k(v1w1) + k(v2w2)              Associativity of Real Number Multiplication

      = k(v1w1 + v2w2)                 Distributive Law of Real Numbers

      = k v1, v2 · w1, w2              Definition of Dot Product

      = k(v · w)

We leave the proof of k(v · w) = v · (kw) as an exercise.
11.9 The Dot Product and Projection                                                     1035

For the last property, we note that if v = v1, v2 , then v · v = v1, v2 · v1, v2 = v21 + v22 = v 2,
where the last equality comes courtesy of Definition 11.8.
The following example puts Theorem 11.22 to good use. As in Example 11.8.3, we work out the
problem in great detail and encourage the reader to supply the justification for each step.

Example 11.9.1. Prove the identity: v - w 2 = v 2 - 2(v · w) + w 2.
Solution. We begin by rewriting v - w 2 in terms of the dot product using Theorem 11.22.

Hence,            v - w 2 = (v - w) · (v - w)
                               = (v + [-w]) · (v + [-w])
                               = (v + [-w]) · v + (v + [-w]) · [-w]
                               = v · (v + [-w]) + [-w] · (v + [-w])
                               = v · v + v · [-w] + [-w] · v + [-w] · [-w]
                               = v · v + v · [(-1)w] + [(-1)w] · v + [(-1)w] · [(-1)w]
                               = v · v + (-1)(v · w) + (-1)(w · v) + [(-1)(-1)](w · w)
                               = v · v + (-1)(v · w) + (-1)(v · w) + w · w
                               = v · v - 2(v · w) + w · w
                               = v 2 - 2(v · w) + w 2

        v - w 2 = v 2 - 2(v · w) + w 2 as required.

If we take a step back from the pedantry in Example 11.9.1, we see that the bulk of the work is
needed to show that (v -w)·(v -w) = v ·v -2(v ·w)+w·w. If this looks familiar, it should. Since the
dot product enjoys many of the same properties enjoyed by real numbers, the machinations required
to expand (v - w) · (v - w) for vectors v and w match those required to expand (v - w)(v - w) for
real numbers v and w, and hence we get similar looking results. The identity verified in Example
11.9.1 plays a large role in the development of the geometric properties of the dot product, which
we now explore.

Suppose v and w are two nonzero vectors. If we draw v and w with the same initial point, we define
the angle between v and w to be the angle  determined by the rays containing the vectors v and
w, as illustrated below. We require 0    . (Think about why this is needed in the definition.)

               v  w                             v

            w                          v

                                     

        =0           0<<                  w
                                             =

The following theorem gives us some insight into the geometric role the dot product plays.

 Theorem 11.23. Geometric Interpretation of Dot Product: If v and w are nonzero
 vectors then v · w = v w cos(), where  is the angle between v and w.
1036                                                                  Applications of Trigonometry

We prove Theorem 11.23 in cases. If  = 0, then v and w have the same direction. It follows1 that
there is a real number k > 0 so that w = kv. Hence, v · w = v · (kv) = k(v · v) = k v 2 = k v v .
Since k > 0, k = |k|, so k v = |k| v = kv by Theorem 11.20. Hence, k v v = v (k v ) =

 v kv = v w . Since cos(0) = 1, we get v · w = k v v = v w = v w cos(0), proving
that the formula holds for  = 0. If  = , we repeat the argument with the difference being w = kv
where k < 0. In this case, |k| = -k, so k v = -|k| v = - kv = - w . Since cos() = -1, we
get v · w = - v w = v w cos(), as required. Next, if 0 <  < , the vectors v, w and v - w
determine a triangle with side lengths v , w and v - w , respectively, as seen below.

            w v-w                                                                   v-w

                                          v                        w            
                        

                                                                                    v

The Law of Cosines yields v - w 2 = v 2 + w 2 - 2 v w cos(). From Example 11.9.1,
we know v - w 2 = v 2 - 2(v · w) + w 2. Equating these two expressions for v - w 2 gives

 v 2 + w 2 -2 v w cos() = v 2 -2(v·w)+ w 2 which reduces to -2 v w cos() = -2(v·w),

or v · w = v w cos(), as required. An immediate consequence of Theorem 11.23 is the following.

Theorem 11.24. Let v and w be nonzero vectors and let  the angle between v and w. Then

                           = arccos          v·w             = arccos(v^ · w^)
                                             vw

We obtain the formula in Theorem 11.24 by solving the equation given in Theorem 11.23 for . Since

v and w are nonzero, so are v and w . Hence, we may divide both sides of v · w = v w cos()

by v  w  to get cos() =    v·w  .  Since 0           by definition, the values of        exactly match the
                          vw

range of the arccosine function. Hence,  = arccos             v·w  . Using Theorem 11.22, we can rewrite
                                                             vw

v w v·w = 1v v · 1w w = v^ · w^, giving us the alternative formula  = arccos(v^ · w^).

We are overdue for an example.

Example 11.9.2. Find the angle between the following pairs of vectors.

                                
1. v = 3, -3 3 , and w = - 3, 1

2. v = 2, 2 , and w = 5, -5

3. v = 3, -4 , and w = 2, 1

Solution. We use the formula  = arccos        v·w    from Theorem 11.24 in each case below.

   2. For v = 2, 2 and w = 5, -5 , we find v · w = 2, 2 · 5, -5 = 10 - 10 = 0. Hence, it doesn't

     matter what v and w are,2  = arccos           v·w          = arccos(0) = 2 .

     of the common angles, we leave our answer as  = arccos              25  .

The vectors v = 2, 2 , and w = 5, -5 in Example 11.9.2 are called orthogonal and we write

v    w,  because the angle between them is     radians  =  90.  Geometrically,  when orthogonal vectors
                                            2

are sketched with the same initial point, the lines containing the vectors are perpendicular.

                              v and w are orthogonal, v  w

We state the relationship between orthogonal vectors and their dot product in the following theorem.

   Theorem 11.25. The Dot Product Detects Orthogonality: Let v and w be nonzero
   vectors. Then v  w if and only if v · w = 0.

To prove Theorem 11.25, we first assume v and w are nonzero vectors with v  w. By definition,

the angle between v and w is 2 . By Theorem 11.23, v · w =              v    w  cos         = 0. Conversely,
                                                                                     2

if v and w are nonzero vectors and v · w = 0, then Theorem 11.24 gives  = arccos                  v·w             =
                                                                                                 vw

arccos     0  = arccos(0) = 2 , so v  w. We can use Theorem 11.25 in the following example
         vw

to provide a different proof about the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines.3

Example 11.9.3. Let L1 be the line y = m1x + b1 and let L2 be the line y = m2x + b2. Prove that
L1 is perpendicular to L2 if and only if m1 · m2 = -1.

Solution. Our strategy is to find two vectors: v1, which has the same direction as L1, and v2,
which has the same direction as L2 and show v1  v2 if and only if m1m2 = -1. To that end, we
substitute x = 0 and x = 1 into y = m1x + b1 to find two points which lie on L1, namely P (0, b1)

   2Note that there is no `zero product property' for the dot product since neither v nor w is 0, yet v · w = 0.
   3See Exercise 2.1.1 in Section 2.1.

and Q(1, m1 + b1). We let v1 = P Q = 1 - 0, (m1 + b1) - b1 = 1, m1 , and note that since v1 is
determined by two points on L1, it may be viewed as lying on L1. Hence it has the same direction
as L1. Similarly, we get the vector v2 = 1, m2 which has the same direction as the line L2. Hence,
L1 and L2 are perpendicular if and only if v1  v2. According to Theorem 11.25, v1  v2 if and
only if v1 · v2 = 0. Notice that v1 · v2 = 1, m1 · 1, m2 = 1 + m1m2. Hence, v1 · v2 = 0 if and only
if 1 + m1m2 = 0, which is true if and only if m1m2 = -1, as required.

While Theorem 11.25 certainly gives us some insight into what the dot product means geometrically,

there is more to the story of the dot product. Consider the two nonzero vectors v and w drawn

with a common initial point O below. For the moment, assume that the angle between v and w,

which we'll denote , is acute. We wish to develop a formula for the vector p, indicated below,

which is called the orthogonal projection of v onto w. The vector p is obtained geometrically

as follows: drop a perpendicular from the terminal point T of v to the vector w and call the point
                                                                       --

of intersection R. The vector p is then defined as p = OR. Like any vector, p is determined by its

magnitude p and its direction p^ according to the formula p = p p^. Since we want p^ to have the

same direction as w, we have p^ = w^. To determine p , we make use of Theorem 10.4 as applied
to the right triangle ORT . We find cos() = vp , or p = v cos(). To get things in terms of
just v and w, we use Theorem 11.23 to get p = v cos() = v w w cos() = w v·w . Using Theorem

11.22,  we  rewrite  v·w  =v·  1w w = v · w^. Hence, p = v · w^, and since p^ = w^, we now have a
                      w

formula for p completely in terms of v and w, namely p = p p^ = (v · w^)w^.

            v                     vT                    T

                                                     v

                               w                  w

                                               R                               R
            O
                                           --                   p
                                      p = OR         O

                                  O

Now suppose that the angle  between v and w is obtuse, and consider the diagram below. In this
case, we see that p^ = -w^ and using the triangle ORT , we find p = v cos( ). Since  + = ,
it follows that cos( ) = - cos(), which means p = v cos( ) = - v cos(). Rewriting this
last equation in terms of v and w as before, we get p = -(v · w^). Putting this together with
p^ = -w^, we get p = p p^ = -(v · w^)(-w^) = (v · w^)w^ in this case as well.

If  the  angle  between  v  and  w  is     then  it  is  easy  to  show4  that  p = 0.          Since  v  w  in  this  case,
                                        2

v · w = 0. It follows that v · w^ = 0 and p = 0 = 0w^ = (v · w^)w^ in this case, too. This gives us

Definition 11.12. Let v and w be nonzero vectors. The orthogonal projection of v onto
w, denoted projw(v) is given by projw(v) = (v · w^)w^.

Definition 11.12 gives us a good idea what the dot product does. The scalar v · w^ is a measure
of how much of the vector v is in the direction of the vector w and is thus called the scalar
projection of v onto w. While the formula given in Definition 11.12 is theoretically appealing,
because of the presence of the normalized unit vector w^, computing the projection using the formula
projw(v) = (v · w^)w^ can be messy. We present two other formulas that are often used in practice.

Theorem 11.26. Alternate Formulas for Vector Projections: If v and w are nonzero
vectors then

                               projw(v) = (v · w^)w^ = w 2 v · w w = v · w w · w w

The proof of Theorem 11.26, which we leave to the reader as an exercise, amounts to using the

formula w^ =    1  w and properties of the dot product. It is time for an example.
                w

Example 11.9.4. Let v = 1, 8 and w = -1, 2 . Find p = projw(v), and plot v, w and p in
standard position.

Solution. We find v · w = 1, 8 · -1, 2 = (-1) + 16 = 15 and w · w = -1, 2 · -1, 2 = 1 + 4 = 5.
Hence, p = v·w w·w w = 155 -1, 2 = -3, 6 . We plot v, w and p below.

       In this case, the point R coincides with the point O, so p = OR = OO = 0.

Suppose we wanted to verify that our answer p in Example 11.9.4 is indeed the orthogonal projection
of v onto w. We first note that since p is a scalar multiple of w, it has the correct direction, so
what remains to check is the orthogonality condition. Consider the vector q whose initial point is
the terminal point of p and whose terminal point is the terminal point of v.

From the definition of vector arithmetic, p + q = v, so that q = v - p. In the case of Example 11.9.4,
v = 1, 8 and p = -3, 6 , so q = 1, 8 - -3, 6 = 4, 2 . Then q·w = 4, 2 · -1, 2 = (-4)+4 = 0,
which shows q  w, as required. This result is generalized in the following theorem.

 Theorem 11.27. Generalized Decomposition Theorem: Let v and w be nonzero vectors.
 There are unique vectors p and q such that v = p + q where p = kw for some scalar k, and
 q · w = 0.

Note that if the vectors p and q in Theorem 11.27 are nonzero, then we can say p is parallel 5 to
w and q is orthogonal to w. In this case, the vector p is sometimes called the `vector component
of v parallel to w' and q is called the `vector component of v orthogonal to w.' To prove Theorem
11.27, we take p = projw(v) and q = v - p. Then p is, by definition, a scalar multiple of w. Next,
we compute q · w.

Hence, q · w = 0, as required. At this point, we have shown that the vectors p and q guaranteed
by Theorem 11.27 exist. Now we need to show that they are unique. Suppose v = p + q = p + q
where the vectors p and q satisfy the same properties described in Theorem 11.27 as p and q.
Then p - p = q - q, so w · (p - p ) = w · (q - q) = w · q - w · q = 0 - 0 = 0. Hence,
w · (p - p ) = 0. Now there are scalars k and k so that p = kw and p = k w. This means
w · (p - p ) = w · (kw - k w) = w · ([k - k ]w) = (k - k )(w · w) = (k - k ) w 2. Since w = 0,
 w 2 = 0, which means the only way w · (p - p ) = (k - k ) w 2 = 0 is for k - k = 0, or k = k .
This means p = kw = k w = p . With q - q = p - p = p - p = 0, it must be that q = q as
well. Hence, we have shown there is only one way to write v as a sum of vectors as described in
Theorem 11.27.

We close this section with an application of the dot product. In Physics, if a constant force F is
exerted over a distance d, the work W done by the force is given by W = F d. Here, we assume the
force is being applied in the direction of the motion. If the force applied is not in the direction of
the motion, we can use the dot product to find the work done. Consider the scenario below where
the constant force F is applied to move an object from the point P to the point Q.

        P                            Q

To find the work W done in this scenario, we need to find how much of the force F is in the
                                --
direction of the motion P Q. This is precisely what the dot product F · P Q represents. Since
           --                                       --                -- --
the distance the object travels is P Q , we get W = (F · P Q) P Q . Since P Q = P Q P Q,
--  --               --                      --
W = (F · P Q) P Q = F · ( P Q P Q) = F · P Q = F P Q cos(), where  is the angle between
                                           --
the applied force F and the trajectory of the motion P Q. We have proved the following.

vector P Q. The work W done by F is given by

Example 11.9.5. Taylor exerts a force of 10 pounds to pull her wagon a distance of 50 feet over
level ground. If the handle of the wagon makes a 30 angle with the horizontal, how much work
did Taylor do pulling the wagon? Assume Taylor exerts the force of 10 pounds at a 30 angle for

the duration of the 50 feet.

Solution. There are two ways to attack this problem. One way is to find the vectors F and P Q

                                                                    --
mentioned in Theorem 11.28 and compute W = F · P Q. To do this, we assume the origin is at the

point where the handle of the wagon meets the wagon and the positive x-axis lies along the dashed

line in the figure above. Since the force applied is a constant 10 pounds, we have F = 10. Since

it  is  being  applied  at  a  constant  angle  of    = 30  with  respect  to  the  positive  x-axis,  Definition
                                                        
11.8 gives us F = 10 cos(30, sin(30) = 5 3, 5 . Since the wagon is being pulled along 50
                                                                            --
feet in the positive direction, the displacement vector is P Q = 50^i = 50 1, 0 = 50, 0 . We get
        --                                      
W = F · P Q = 5 3, 5 · 50, 0 = 250 3. Since force is measured in pounds and distance is
                                         
measured in feet, we get W = 250 3 foot-pounds. Alternatively, we can use the formulation
               --                                                 
W = F P Q cos() to get W = (10 pounds)(50 feet) cos (30 ) = 250 3 foot-pounds of work.

21. A force of 1500 pounds is required to tow a trailer. Find the work done towing the trailer
     along a flat stretch of road 300 feet. Assume the force is applied in the direction of the motion.

     wagon across the yard. If she maintains a 15 angle between the handle of the wagon and
     the horizontal, compute how much work Taylor does pulling her wagon 25 feet. Round your
     answer to two decimal places.

24. In Exercise 61 in Section 11.8, two drunken college students have filled an empty beer keg
     with rocks which they drag down the street by pulling on two attached ropes. The stronger
     of the two students pulls with a force of 100 pounds on a rope which makes a 13 angle with
     the direction of motion. (In this case, the keg was being pulled due east and the student's
     heading was N77E.) Find the work done by this student if the keg is dragged 42 feet.

25. Find the work done pushing a 200 pound barrel 10 feet up a 12.5 incline. Ignore all forces
     acting on the barrel except gravity, which acts downwards. Round your answer to two decimal
     places.
     HINT: Since you are working to overcome gravity only, the force being applied acts directly
     upwards. This means that the angle between the applied force in this case and the motion of
     the object is not the 12.5 of the incline!

27. Finish the proof of the scalar property of the dot product in Theorem 11.22.

28. Use the identity in Example 11.9.1 to prove the Parallelogram Law

      v 2+ w 2= 1           v+w 2+ v-w 2
                         2

29. We know that |x + y|  |x| + |y| for all real numbers x and y by the Triangle Inequality
     established in Exercise 36 in Section 2.2. We can now establish a Triangle Inequality for
     vectors. In this exercise, we prove that u + v  u + v for all pairs of vectors u and v.

      (a) (Step 1) Show that u + v 2 = u 2 + 2u · v + v 2.

      (b) (Step 2) Show that |u · v|  u v . This is the celebrated Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.6
           (Hint: To show this inequality, start with the fact that |u · v| = | u v cos() | and use
           the fact that | cos()|  1 for all .)

      (c) (Step 3) Show that u + v 2 = u 2 + 2u · v + v 2  u 2 + 2|u · v| + v 2  u 2 +
           2 u v + v 2 = ( u + v )2.

      (d) (Step 4) Use Step 3 to show that u + v  u + v for all pairs of vectors u and v.

      (e) As an added bonus, we can now show that the Triangle Inequality |z + w|  |z| + |w|
           holds for all complex numbers z and w as well. Identify the complex number z = a + bi
           with the vector u = a, b and identify the complex number w = c + di with the vector
           v = c, d and just follow your nose!

11.10 Parametric Equations

As we have seen in Exercises 53 - 56 in Section 1.2, Chapter 7 and most recently in Section 11.5,
there are scores of interesting curves which, when plotted in the xy-plane, neither represent y as a
function of x nor x as a function of y. In this section, we present a new concept which allows us
to use functions to study these kinds of curves. To motivate the idea, we imagine a bug crawling
across a table top starting at the point O and tracing out a curve C in the plane, as shown below.

          y         P (x, y) = (f (t), g(t))

      2
      1          2345x

              1

The curve C does not represent y as a function of x because it fails the Vertical Line Test and it
does not represent x as a function of y because it fails the Horizontal Line Test. However, since
the bug can be in only one place P (x, y) at any given time t, we can define the x-coordinate of P
as a function of t and the y-coordinate of P as a (usually, but not necessarily) different function of
t. (Traditionally, f (t) is used for x and g(t) is used for y.) The independent variable t in this case
is called a parameter and the system of equations

                                                          x = f (t)
                                                          y = g(t)

is called a system of parametric equations or a parametrization of the curve C.1 The
parametrization of C endows it with an orientation and the arrows on C indicate motion in the
direction of increasing values of t. In this case, our bug starts at the point O, travels upwards to
the left, then loops back around to cross its path2 at the point Q and finally heads off into the
first quadrant. It is important to note that the curve itself is a set of points and as such is devoid
of any orientation. The parametrization determines the orientation and as we shall see, different
parametrizations can determine different orientations. If all of this seems hauntingly familiar,
it should. By definition, the system of equations {x = cos(t), y = sin(t) parametrizes the Unit
Circle, giving it a counter-clockwise orientation. More generally, the equations of circular motion
{x = r cos(t), y = r sin(t) developed on page 732 in Section 10.2.1 are parametric equations
which trace out a circle of radius r centered at the origin. If  > 0, the orientation is counter-
clockwise; if  < 0, the orientation is clockwise. The angular frequency  determines `how fast' the

    1Note the use of the indefinite article `a'. As we shall see, there are infinitely many different parametric represen-
tations for any given curve.

    2Here, the bug reaches the point Q at two different times. While this does not contradict our claim that f (t) and
g(t) are functions of t, it shows that neither f nor g can be one-to-one. (Think about this before reading on.)

object moves around the circle. In particular, the equations x = 2960 cos 12 t , y = 2960 sin 12 t
that model the motion of Lakeland Community College as the earth rotates (see Example 10.2.7 in

Section 10.2) parameterize a circle of radius 2960 with a counter-clockwise rotation which completes

one revolution as t runs through the interval [0, 24). It is time for another example.

Example 11.10.1. Sketch the curve described by  x = t2 - 3 for t  -2.
                                                y = 2t - 1

Solution. We follow the same procedure here as we have time and time again when asked to graph

anything new - choose friendly values of t, plot the corresponding points and connect the results

in a pleasing fashion. Since we are told t  -2, we start there and as we plot successive points, we

draw an arrow to indicate the direction of the path for increasing values of t.

The curve sketched out in Example 11.10.1 certainly looks like a parabola, and the presence of
the t2 term in the equation x = t2 - 3 reinforces this hunch. Since the parametric equations

 x = t2 - 3, y = 2t - 1 given to describe this curve are a system of equations, we can use the
technique of substitution as described in Section 8.7 to eliminate the parameter t and get an
equation involving just x and y. To do so, we choose to solve the equation y = 2t - 1 for t to
get t = 2 y+1 . Substituting this into the equation x = t2 - 3 yields x = 2 y+1 - 2 3 or, after some
rearrangement, (y + 1)2 = 4(x + 3). Thinking back to Section 7.3, we see that the graph of this
equation is a parabola with vertex (-3, -1) which opens to the right, as required. Technically
speaking, the equation (y + 1)2 = 4(x + 3) describes the entire parabola, while the parametric
equations x = t2 - 3, y = 2t - 1 for t  -2 describe only a portion of the parabola. In this case,3
we can remedy this situation by restricting the bounds on y. Since the portion of the parabola we
want is exactly the part where y  -5, the equation (y + 1)2 = 4(x + 3) coupled with the restriction
y  -5 describes the same curve as the given parametric equations. The one piece of information
we can never recover after eliminating the parameter is the orientation of the curve.

Eliminating the parameter and obtaining an equation in terms of x and y, whenever possible,
can be a great help in graphing curves determined by parametric equations. If the system of
parametric equations contains algebraic functions, as was the case in Example 11.10.1, then the
usual techniques of substitution and elimination as learned in Section 8.7 can be applied to the

    3We will have an example shortly where no matter how we restrict x and y, we can never accurately describe the
curve once we've eliminated the parameter.

system {x = f (t), y = g(t) to eliminate the parameter. If, on the other hand, the parametrization
involves the trigonometric functions, the strategy changes slightly. In this case, it is often best
to solve for the trigonometric functions and relate them using an identity. We demonstrate these
techniques in the following example.

Example 11.10.2. Sketch the curves described by the following parametric equations.

1.    x = t3  2 for -1  t  1                     3. x = sin(t) for 0 < t < 
                                                        y = csc(t)
      y = 2t

2.    x = e-t                                    4. x = 1 + 3 cos(t) y = 2 sin(t) for 0  t  23
              -2t for t  0
      y=e

Solution.

1. To get a feel for the curve described by the system x = t3, y = 2t2 we first sketch the

      graphs of x = t3 and y = 2t2 over the interval [-1, 1]. We note that as t takes on values

      in the interval [-1, 1], x = t3 ranges between -1 and 1, and y = 2t2 ranges between 0

      and 2. This means that all of the action is happening on a portion of the plane, namely

      {(x, y) | - 1  x  1, 0  y  2}. Next, we plot a few points to get a sense of the position

      and orientation of the curve. Certainly, t = -1 and t = 1 are good values to pick since

      these are the extreme values of t. We also choose t = 0, since that corresponds to a relative

      minimum4 on the graph of y = 2t2. Plugging in t = -1 gives the point (-1, 2), t = 0 gives

      (0, 0) and t = 1 gives (1, 2). More generally, we see that x = t3 is increasing over the entire

      interval [-1, 1] whereas y = 2t2 is decreasing over the interval [-1, 0] and then increasing

      over [0, 1]. Geometrically, this means that in order to trace out the path described by the

      parametric equations, we start at (-1, 2) (where t = -1), then move to the right (since x is

      increasing) and down (since y is decreasing) to (0, 0) (where t = 0). We continue to move

      to the right (since x is still increasing) but now move upwards (since y is now increasing)

      until we reach (1, 2) (where t = 1). Finally, to get a good sense of the shape of the curve, we
      eliminate the parameter. Solving x = t3 for t, we get t = 3 x. Substituting this into y = 2t2
      gives y = 2(3 x)2 = 2x2/3. Our experience in Section 5.3 yields the graph of our final answer

      below.

                          x                      y                      y

                      -1           -1                     -1

                                                    1  t                     1                  x

              x = t3, -1  t  1     y = 2t2, -1  t  1      x = t3, y = 2t2 , -1  t  1

2. For the system x = 2e-t, y = e-2t for t  0, we proceed as in the previous example and

graph x = 2e-t and y = e-2t over the interval [0, ). We find that the range of x in this

case is (0, 2] and the range of y is (0, 1]. Next, we plug in some friendly values of t to get a

sense of the orientation of the curve. Since t lies in the exponent here, `friendly' values of t

involve natural logarithms. Starting with t = ln(1) = 0 we get5 (2, 1), for t = ln(2) we get

 1, 14 and for t = ln(3) we get 32 , 91 . Since t is ranging over the unbounded interval [0, ),
we take the time to analyze the end behavior of both x and y. As t  , x = 2e-t  0+

and y = e-2t  0+ as well. This means the graph of x = 2e-t, y = e-2t approaches the

point (0, 0). Since both x = 2e-t and y = e-2t are always decreasing for t  0, we know

that our final graph will start at (2, 1) (where t = 0), and move consistently to the left (since

x is decreasing) and down (since y is decreasing) to approach the origin. To eliminate the

parameter, one way to proceed is to solve x = 2e-t for t to get t = - ln                           x          .  Substituting
                                                                                                   2
this for t in y = e-2t gives y = e-2(- ln(x/2)) = e2 ln(x/2) = eln(x/2)2 = x 2 2 = x2 4 . Or, we could
recognize that y = e-2t = e-t 2, and since x = 2e-t means e-t = x2 , we get y = 2x 2 = 4x2
this way as well. Either way, the graph of x = 2e-t, y = e-2t for t  0 is a portion of the

parabola  y    =  x2  which       starts  at  the  point    (2, 1)  and  heads  towards,  but   never         reaches,6  (0, 0).

3. For the system {x = sin(t), y = csc(t) for 0 < t < , we start by graphing x = sin(t) and

y = csc(t) over the interval (0, ). We find that the range of x is (0, 1] while the range of

y  is [1, ).   Plotting a few friendly points, we see that t =                        gives the point            12 , 2 , t = 2
                                                                                   6
                            5                             12 , 2 . Since t = 0 and t =  aren't included in the
gives  (1, 1)  and    t  =  6     returns     us   to

domain for t, (because y = csc(t) is undefined at these t-values), we analyze the behavior of

the system as t approaches 0 and . We find that as t  0+ as well as when t  -, we get

x = sin(t)  0+ and y = csc(t)  . Piecing all of this information together, we get that for

t near 0, we have points with very small positive x-values, but very large positive y-values.

As t ranges through the interval 0, 2 , x = sin(t) is increasing and y = csc(t) is decreasing.
                                                                                                   12 , 2                 
This means that we are moving to the right and downwards, through                                             when  t  =  6  to

(1, 1) when t = 2 . Once t = 2 , the orientation reverses, and we start to head to the left,

since x = sin(t) is now decreasing, and up, since y = csc(t) is now increasing. We pass back

through   12 , 2  when         t  =  5    back    to   the  points    with  small  positive  x-coordinates          and   large

      positive y-coordinates. To better explain this behavior, we eliminate the parameter. Using a

      reciprocal identity, we write y = csc(t) = sin(t) 1 . Since x = sin(t), the curve traced out by this

      parametrization is a portion of the graph of y = 1x . We now can explain the unusual behavior
      as t  0+ and t  - - for these values of t, we are hugging the vertical asymptote x = 0 of

      the graph of y = 1x . We see that the parametrization given above traces out the portion of

                x = sin(t), 0 < t <                        y = csc(t), 0 < t <                         {x = sin(t), y = csc(t) , 0 < t < 

4.    Proceeding         as   above,         we    set  about    graphing         {x = 1 + 3 cos(t),          y  = 2 sin(t)        for  0t             3      by
                                                                                                                                                       2
      first graphing x = 1 + 3 cos(t) and y = 2 sin(t) on the interval 0, 32 . We see that x ranges
                                                                                                       2 ,         3
      from  -2     to    4  and     y  ranges       from   -2  to   2.  Plugging         in  t  =  0,         and  2  gives        the     points      (4, 0),

      (1, 2), (-2, 0) and (1, -2), respectively. As t ranges from 0 to 2 , x = 1 + 3 cos(t) is decreasing,

      while y = 2 sin(t) is increasing. This means that we start tracing out our answer at (4, 0) and

      continue     moving        to    the     left  and   upwards      towards        (1, 2).  For           t    ,  x      is  decreasing,        as    is  y,
                                                                                                       2

      so the motion is still right to left, but now is downwards from (1, 2) to (-2, 0). On the interval

       , 32 , x begins to increase, while y continues to decrease. Hence, the motion becomes left
      to right but continues downwards, connecting (-2, 0) to (1, -2). To eliminate the parameter

      here, we note that the trigonometric functions involved, namely cos(t) and sin(t), are related

      by the Pythagorean Identity cos2(t) + sin2(t) = 1. Hence, we solve x = 1 + 3 cos(t) for cos(t)

      to get cos(t) = 3 x-1 , and we solve y = 2 sin(t) for sin(t) to get sin(t) = 2y . Substituting these
      expressions into cos2(t)+sin2(t) = 1 gives 3 x-1 2 + 2y 2 = 1, or 9 (x-1)2 + 4y2 = 1. From Section
      7.4, we know that the graph of this equation is an ellipse centered at (1, 0) with vertices at

      (-2, 0) and (4, 0) with a minor axis of length 4. Our parametric equations here are tracing

      out three-quarters of this ellipse, in a counter-clockwise direction.

11.10 Parametric Equations  1053

Now that we have had some good practice sketching the graphs of parametric equations, we turn
to the problem of finding parametric representations of curves. We start with the following.

                                    Parametrizations of Common Curves

       To parametrize y = f (x) as x runs through some interval I, let x = t and y = f (t) and let
         t run through I.

       To parametrize x = g(y) as y runs through some interval I, let x = g(t) and y = t and let
         t run through I.

       To parametrize a directed line segment with initial point (x0, y0) and terminal point (x1, y1),
         let x = x0 + (x1 - x0)t and y = y0 + (y1 - y0)t for 0  t  1.

       To parametrize a2 (x-h)2 + b2 (y-k)2 = 1 where a, b > 0, let x = h + a cos(t) and y = k + b sin(t)
         for 0  t < 2. (This will impart a counter-clockwise orientation.)

The reader is encouraged to verify the above formulas by eliminating the parameter and, when
indicated, checking the orientation. We put these formulas to good use in the following example.

Example 11.10.3. Find a parametrization for each of the following curves and check your answers.

   1. y = x2 from x = -3 to x = 2

   2. y = f -1(x) where f (x) = x5 + 2x + 1

   3. The line segment which starts at (2, -3) and ends at (1, 5)

   4. The circle x2 + 2x + y2 - 4y = 4

   5. The left half of the ellipse 4x2 + 9y2 = 1

Solution.

   1. Since y = x2 is written in the form y = f (x), we let x = t and y = f (t) = t2. Since x = t, the
       bounds on t match precisely the bounds on x so we get x = t, y = t2 for -3  t  2. The
       check is almost trivial; with x = t we have y = t2 = x2 as t = x runs from -3 to 2.

   2. We are told to parametrize y = f -1(x) for f (x) = x5 + 2x + 1 so it is safe to assume that
       f is one-to-one. (Otherwise, f -1 would not exist.) To find a formula y = f -1(x), we follow
       the procedure outlined on page 384 - we start with the equation y = f (x), interchange x and
       y and solve for y. Doing so gives us the equation x = y5 + 2y + 1. While we could attempt
       to solve this equation for y, we don't need to. We can parametrize x = f (y) = y5 + 2y + 1
       by setting y = t so that x = t5 + 2t + 1. We know from our work in Section 3.1 that since
       f (x) = x5 + 2x + 1 is an odd-degree polynomial, the range of y = f (x) = x5 + 2x + 1 is
       (-, ). Hence, in order to trace out the entire graph of x = f (y) = y5 + 2y + 1, we need to
       let y run through all real numbers. Our final answer to this problem is x = t5 + 2t + 1, y = t
       for - < t < . As in the previous problem, our solution is trivial to check.7

    7Provided you followed the inverse function theory, of course.

3. To parametrize line segment which starts at (2, -3) and ends at (1, 5), we make use of the
   formulas x = x0 +(x1 -x0)t and y = y0 +(y1 -y0)t for 0  t  1. While these equations at first
   glance are quite a handful,8 they can be summarized as `starting point + (displacement)t'.
   To find the equation for x, we have that the line segment starts at x = 2 and ends at x = 1.
   This means the displacement in the x-direction is (1 - 2) = -1. Hence, the equation for x is
   x = 2 + (-1)t = 2 - t. For y, we note that the line segment starts at y = -3 and ends at
   y = 5. Hence, the displacement in the y-direction is (5 - (-3)) = 8, so we get y = -3 + 8t.
   Our final answer is {x = 2 - t, y = -3 + 8t for 0  t  1. To check, we can solve x = 2 - t
   for t to get t = 2 - x. Substituting this into y = -3 + 8t gives y = -3 + 8t = -3 + 8(2 - x),
   or y = -8x + 13. We know this is the graph of a line, so all we need to check is that it starts
   and stops at the correct points. When t = 0, x = 2 - t = 2, and when t = 1, x = 2 - t = 1.
   Plugging in x = 2 gives y = -8(2) + 13 = -3, for an initial point of (2, -3). Plugging in
   x = 1 gives y = -8(1) + 13 = 5 for an ending point of (1, 5), as required.

4. In order to use the formulas above to parametrize the circle x2 +2x+y2 -4y = 4, we first need
   to put it into the correct form. After completing the squares, we get (x + 1)2 + (y - 2)2 = 9,
   or 9 (x+1)2 + 9 (y-2)2 = 1. Once again, the formulas x = h + a cos(t) and y = k + b sin(t) can be
   a challenge to memorize, but they come from the Pythagorean Identity cos2(t) + sin2(t) = 1.
   In the equation 9 (x+1)2 + 9 (y-2)2 = 1, we identify cos(t) = 3 x+1 and sin(t) = 3 y-2 . Rearranging
   these last two equations, we get x = -1 + 3 cos(t) and y = 2 + 3 sin(t). In order to complete
   one revolution around the circle, we let t range through the interval [0, 2). We get as our final
   answer {x = -1 + 3 cos(t), y = 2 + 3 sin(t) for 0  t < 2. To check our answer, we could
   eliminate the parameter by solving x = -1 + 3 cos(t) for cos(t) and y = 2 + 3 sin(t) for sin(t),
   invoking a Pythagorean Identity, and then manipulating the resulting equation in x and y
   into the original equation x2 + 2x + y2 - 4y = 4. Instead, we opt for a more direct approach.
   We substitute x = -1 + 3 cos(t) and y = 2 + 3 sin(t) into the equation x2 + 2x + y2 - 4y = 4
   and show that the latter is satisfied for all t such that 0  t < 2.

      x2 + 2x + y2 - 4y = 4

      (-1 + 3 cos(t))2 + 2(-1 + 3 cos(t)) + (2 + 3 sin(t))2 - 4(2 + 3 sin(t))              ?  4

                                                                                           =

      1 - 6 cos(t) + 9 cos2(t) - 2 + 6 cos(t) + 4 + 12 sin(t) + 9 sin2(t) - 8 - 12 sin(t)  ?  4

                                                                                           =

      9 cos2(t) + 9 sin2(t) - 5                                                            ?  4

                                                                                           =

      9 cos2(t) + sin2(t) - 5                                                              ?  4

                                                                                           =

                         ?

      9 (1) - 5 = 4

      4=4

    Now that we know the parametric equations give us points on the circle, we can go through
    the usual analysis as demonstrated in Example 11.10.2 to show that the entire circle is covered
    as t ranges through the interval [0, 2).

8Compare and contrast this with Exercise 65 in Section 11.8.
11.10 Parametric Equations                                                                       1055

5. In the equation 4x2 + 9y2 = 1, we can either use the formulas above or think back to the
   Pythagorean Identity to get x = 2 cos(t) and y = 3 sin(t). The normal range on the parameter

in this case is 0  t < 2, but since we are interested in only the left half of the ellipse, we

restrict t to the values which correspond to Quadrant II and Quadrant III angles, namely

   t       32 .  Our final answer is {x = 2 cos(t), y = 3 sin(t)  for     t   32 .       Substituting
2                                                                      2
x = 2 cos(t) and y = 3 sin(t) into 4x2 + 9y2 = 1 gives 4 4 cos2(t) + 9 9 sin2(t) = 1, which reduces
to the Pythagorean Identity cos2(t) + sin2(t) = 1. This proves that the points generated by

the parametric equations {x = 2 cos(t), y = 3 sin(t) lie on the ellipse 4x2 + 9y2 = 1. Employing
                                                                                                   3
the  techniques  demonstrated  in  Example  11.10.2,  we  find  that   the  restriction  2    t    2

generates the left half of the ellipse, as required.

We note that the formulas given on page 1053 offer only one of literally infinitely many ways to
parametrize the common curves listed there. At times, the formulas offered there need to be altered
to suit the situation. Two easy ways to alter parametrizations are given below.

                                        Adjusting Parametric Equations

       Reversing Orientation: Replacing every occurrence of t with -t in a parametric de-
         scription for a curve (including any inequalities which describe the bounds on t) reverses
         the orientation of the curve.

 Shift of Parameter: Replacing every occurrence of t with (t - c) in a parametric de-
   scription for a curve (including any inequalities which describe the bounds on t) shifts the
   start of the parameter t ahead by c units.

We demonstrate these techniques in the following example.
Example 11.10.4. Find a parametrization for the following curves.

1. The curve which starts at (2, 4) and follows the parabola y = x2 to end at (-1, 1). Shift the
   parameter so that the path starts at t = 0.

2. The two part path which starts at (0, 0), travels along a line to (3, 4), then travels along a
   line to (5, 0).

3. The Unit Circle, oriented clockwise, with t = 0 corresponding to (0, -1).

Solution.

1. We can parametrize y = x2 from x = -1 to x = 2 using the formula given on Page 1053 as
     x = t, y = t2 for -1  t  2. This parametrization, however, starts at (-1, 1) and ends at

   (2, 4). Hence, we need to reverse the orientation. To do so, we replace every occurrence of t
   with -t to get x = -t, y = (-t)2 for -1  -t  2. After simplifying, we get x = -t, y = t2

   for -2  t  1. We would like t to begin at t = 0 instead of t = -2. The problem here is

   that the parametrization we have starts 2 units `too soon', so we need to introduce a `time
   delay' of 2. Replacing every occurrence of t with (t - 2) gives x = -(t - 2), y = (t - 2)2 for
   -2  t - 2  1. Simplifying yields x = 2 - t, y = t2 - 4t + 4 for 0  t  3.

2. When parameterizing line segments, we think: `starting point + (displacement)t'. For the
   first part of the path, we get {x = 3t, y = 4t for 0  t  1, and for the second part
   we get {x = 3 + 2t, y = 4 - 4t for 0  t  1. Since the first parametrization leaves off
   at t = 1, we shift the parameter in the second part so it starts at t = 1. Our current
   description of the second part starts at t = 0, so we introduce a `time delay' of 1 unit
   to the second set of parametric equations. Replacing t with (t - 1) in the second set of
   parametric equations gives {x = 3 + 2(t - 1), y = 4 - 4(t - 1) for 0  t - 1  1. Simplify-
   ing yields {x = 1 + 2t, y = 8 - 4t for 1  t  2. Hence, we may parametrize the path as
   {x = f (t), y = g(t) for 0  t  2 where

                  f (t) =         3t, for 0  t  1              and g(t) =          4t, for 0  t  1
                             1 + 2t, for 1  t  2                              8 - 4t, for 1  t  2

3. We know that {x = cos(t), y = sin(t) for 0  t < 2 gives a counter-clockwise parametrization

      of the Unit Circle with t = 0 corresponding to (1, 0), so the first order of business is to reverse

      the orientation. Replacing t with -t gives {x = cos(-t), y = sin(-t) for 0  -t < 2,

      which simplifies9 to {x = cos(t), y = - sin(t) for -2 < t  0. This parametrization gives

      a clockwise orientation, but t = 0 still corresponds to the point (1, 0); the point (0, -1) is

      reached when t = - 32 . Our strategy is to first get the parametrization to `start' at the
      point (0, -1) and then shift the parameter accordingly so the `start' coincides with t = 0.

      We know that any interval of length 2 will parametrize the entire circle, so we keep the

      equations {x = cos(t), y = - sin(t) , but start the parameter t at - 32 , and find the upper
      bound by adding 2 so - 32  t < 2 . The reader can verify that {x = cos(t), y = - sin(t)
           - 32       
      for         t<  2    traces  out      the  Unit  Circle  clockwise   starting  at  the  point  (0, -1).                                                   We  now

      shift  the  parameter  by    introducing   a     `time   delay'  of  3  units  by  replacing   every  occurrence
                                                                           2
      of t with t - 32 . We get x = cos t - 32 , y = - sin t - 32 for - 32  t - 32 < 2 . This
      simplifies10 to {x = - sin(t), y = - cos(t) for 0  t < 2, as required.

We put our answer to Example 11.10.4 number 3 to good use to derive the equation of a cycloid.
Suppose a circle of radius r rolls along the positive x-axis at a constant velocity v as pictured below.
Let  be the angle in radians which measures the amount of clockwise rotation experienced by the

Our goal is to find parametric equations for the coordinates of the point P (x, y) in terms of .
From our work in Example 11.10.4 number 3, we know that clockwise motion along the Unit
Circle starting at the point (0, -1) can be modeled by the equations {x = - sin(), y = - cos()
for 0   < 2. (We have renamed the parameter `' to match the context of this problem.) To
model this motion on a circle of radius r, all we need to do11 is multiply both x and y by the
factor r which yields {x = -r sin(), y = -r cos() . We now need to adjust for the fact that the
circle isn't stationary with center (0, 0), but rather, is rolling along the positive x-axis. Since the
velocity v is constant, we know that at time t, the center of the circle has traveled a distance vt
down the positive x-axis. Furthermore, since the radius of the circle is r and the circle isn't moving
vertically, we know that the center of the circle is always r units above the x-axis. Putting these two
facts together, we have that at time t, the center of the circle is at the point (vt, r). From Section
10.1.1, we know v = rt , or vt = r. Hence, the center of the circle, in terms of the parameter ,
is (r, r). As a result, we need to modify the equations {x = -r sin(), y = -r cos() by shifting
the x-coordinate to the right r units (by adding r to the expression for x) and the y-coordinate
up r units12 (by adding r to the expression for y). We get {x = -r sin() + r, y = -r cos() + r ,
which can be written as {x = r( - sin()), y = r(1 - cos()) . Since the motion starts at  = 0
and proceeds indefinitely, we set   0.

We end the section with a demonstration of the graphing calculator.

Example 11.10.5. Find the parametric equations of a cycloid which results from a circle of radius
3 rolling down the positive x-axis as described above. Graph your answer using a calculator.

Solution. We have r = 3 which gives the equations {x = 3(t - sin(t)), y = 3(1 - cos(t)) for t  0.
(Here we have returned to the convention of using t as the parameter.) Sketching the cycloid by
hand is a wonderful exercise in Calculus, but for the purposes of this book, we use a graphing utility.
Using a calculator to graph parametric equations is very similar to graphing polar equations on a
calculator.13 Ensuring that the calculator is in `Parametric Mode' and `radian mode' we enter the
equations and advance to the `Window' screen.

As always, the challenge is to determine appropriate bounds on the parameter, t, as well as for
x and y. We know that one full revolution of the circle occurs over the interval 0  t < 2, so

11If  we  replace  x  with  x  and  y  with  y  in  the  equation  for  the  Unit  Circle  x2 + y2  = 1,  we  obtain  rx 2 +  ry 2 = 1
                            r                r
which reduces to x2 + y2 = r2. In the language of Section 1.7, we are stretching the graph by a factor of r in both

the x- and y-directions. Hence, we multiply both the x- and y-coordinates of points on the graph by r.
  12Does this seem familiar? See Example 11.1.1 in Section 11.1.
  13See page 959 in Section 11.5.
1058                                    Applications of Trigonometry

it seems reasonable to keep these as our bounds on t. The `Tstep' seems reasonably small - too
large a value here can lead to incorrect graphs.14 We know from our derivation of the equations of
the cycloid that the center of the generating circle has coordinates (r, r), or in this case, (3t, 3).
Since t ranges between 0 and 2, we set x to range between 0 and 6. The values of y go from the
bottom of the circle to the top, so y ranges between 0 and 6.

Below we graph the cycloid with these settings, and then extend t to range from 0 to 6 which
forces x to range from 0 to 18 yielding three arches of the cycloid. (It is instructive to note
that keeping the y settings between 0 and 6 messes up the geometry of the cycloid. The reader is
invited to use the Zoom Square feature on the graphing calculator to see what window gives a true
geometric perspective of the three arches.)

       using the techniques presented in Section 11.5 and then graphing the parametric equations
       you found using a graphing utility.

  42. Use your results from Exercises 3 and 4 in Section 11.1 to find the parametric equations which

Suppose an object, called a projectile, is launched into the air. Ignoring everything except the force
gravity, the path of the projectile is given by15

                                           for 0  t  T
 x = v0 cos() t
 y = - 1 gt2 + v0 sin() t + s0

            2

where v0 is the initial speed of the object,  is the angle from the horizontal at which the projectile
is launched,16 g is the acceleration due to gravity, s0 is the initial height of the projectile above the

ground and T is the time when the object returns to the ground. (See the figure below.)

                            y

43. Carl's friend Jason competes in Highland Games Competitions across the country. In one

     event, the `hammer throw', he throws a 56 pound weight for distance. If the weight is released
     6 feet above the ground at an angle of 42 with respect to the horizontal with an initial speed

     of 33 feet per second, find the parametric equations for the flight of the hammer. (Here, use
     g = 32 fts2. .) When will the hammer hit the ground? How far away will it hit the ground?
     Check your answer using a graphing utility.

44. Eliminate the parameter in the equations for projectile motion to show that the path of the
     projectile follows the curve

                                       g sec2() 2
                               y = - 2 x + tan()x + s0

                                          2v0

Use the vertex formula (Equation 2.4) to show the maximum height of the projectile is

y=                             v20 sin2()  + s0 when x =  v20 sin(2)

                               2g                         2g

15A nice mix of vectors and Calculus are needed to derive this.
16We've seen this before. It's the angle of elevation which was defined on page 753.

45. In another event, the `sheaf toss', Jason throws a 20 pound weight for height. If the weight
     is released 5 feet above the ground at an angle of 85 with respect to the horizontal and the

     sheaf reaches a maximum height of 31.5 feet, use your results from part 44 to determine how
     fast the sheaf was launched into the air. (Once again, use g = 32 fts2. .)

46. Suppose  = 2 . (The projectile was launched vertically.) Simplify the general parametric
                                                          m
      formula  given  for  y(t)  above  using  g  =  9.8  s2  and  compare  that  to  the  formula  for  s(t)  given

      in Exercise 25 in Section 2.3. What is x(t) in this case?

In Exercises 47 - 52, we explore the hyperbolic cosine function, denoted cosh(t), and the hyper-
bolic sine function, denoted sinh(t), defined below:

                           cosh(t) = et + e-t and sinh(t) = et - e-t
                                               2                            2

47. Using a graphing utility as needed, verify that the domain of cosh(t) is (-, ) and the
     range of cosh(t) is [1, ).

48. Using a graphing utility as needed, verify that the domain and range of sinh(t) are both
     (-, ).

49. Show that {x(t) = cosh(t), y(t) = sinh(t) parametrize the right half of the `unit' hyperbola
     x2 - y2 = 1. (Hence the use of the adjective `hyperbolic.')

50. Compare the definitions of cosh(t) and sinh(t) to the formulas for cos(t) and sin(t) given in
     Exercise 83f in Section 11.7.

51. Four other hyperbolic functions are waiting to be defined: the hyperbolic secant sech(t),
     the hyperbolic cosecant csch(t), the hyperbolic tangent tanh(t) and the hyperbolic cotangent
     coth(t). Define these functions in terms of cosh(t) and sinh(t), then convert them to formulas
     involving et and e-t. Consult a suitable reference (a Calculus book, or this entry on the
     hyperbolic functions) and spend some time reliving the thrills of trigonometry with these
     `hyperbolic' functions.

52. If these functions look familiar, they should. Enjoy some nostalgia and revisit Exercise 35 in
     Section 6.5, Exercise 47 in Section 6.3 and the answer to Exercise 38 in Section 6.4.

40. The parametric equations for the inverse are    x = t3 + 3t - 4 for -  < t < 
                                                    y=t

41. r = 6 cos(2) translates to  x = 6 cos(2) cos() for 0   < 2.
                                y = 6 cos(2) sin()

42. The parametric equations which describe the locations of passengers on the London Eye are

      x = 67.5 cos 15 t - 2 = 67.5 sin 15 t                  for -  < t < 
      y = 67.5 sin 15 t - 2 + 67.5 = 67.5 - 67.5 cos 15 t

43. The parametric equations for the hammer throw are             x = 33 cos(42)t for
                                                                  y = -16t2 + 33 sin(42)t + 6

      t  0. To find when the hammer hits the ground, we solve y(t) = 0 and get t  -0.23 or

      1.61. Since t  0, the hammer hits the ground after approximately t = 1.61 seconds after

      it was launched into the air. To find how far away the hammer hits the ground, we find

      x(1.61)  39.48 feet from where it was thrown into the air.

45. We solve y =  v20 sin2()  + s0 =  v20 sin2(85)  + 5 = 31.5 to get v0 = ±41.34. The initial speed

                  2g                  2(32)

      of the sheaf was approximately 41.34 feet per second.
