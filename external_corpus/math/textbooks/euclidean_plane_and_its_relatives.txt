Introduction

This book is meant to be rigorous, conservative, elementary, and mini-
malist. At the same time, it includes about the maximum what students
can absorb in one semester.

    Approximately one-third of the material used to be covered in high
school, but not anymore.

    The present book is based on the courses given by the author at the
Pennsylvania State University as an introduction to the foundations of
geometry. The lectures were oriented to sophomore and senior university
students. These students already had a calculus course. In particular,
they are familiar with real numbers and continuity. It makes it possible
to cover the material faster and in a more rigorous way than it could be
done in high school.

Prerequisite

The students should be familiar with the following topics:
     Elementary set theory: , , , \, , ×.
     Real numbers: intervals, inequalities, algebraic identities.
     Limits, continuous functions, and the intermediate value theorem.
     Standard functions: absolute value, natural logarithm, exponential
       function. Occasionally, trigonometric functions are used, but these
       parts can be ignored.
     Chapter 14 uses basic vector algebra.
     To read Chapter 16, it is better to have some previous experience
       with the scalar product, also known as dot product.
     To read Chapter 18, it is better to have some previous experience
       with complex numbers.

Overview

We use the so-called metric approach introduced by Birkhoff. It means
that we define the Euclidean plane as a metric space that satisfies a list of
properties (axioms). This way we minimize the tedious parts which are
unavoidable in the more classical Hilbert's approach. At the same time,
the students have a chance to learn basic geometry of metric spaces.

    Here is a dependency graph of the chapters.

    In (1) we give all the definitions necessary to formulate the axioms;
it includes metric space, lines, angle measure, continuous maps, and con-
gruent triangles.

    Further, we do Euclidean geometry: (2) Axioms and immediate corol-
laries; (3) Half-planes and continuity; (4) Congruent triangles; (5) Circles,
motions, perpendicular lines; (6) Similar triangles and (7) Parallel lines

   these are the first two chapters where we use Axiom V, an equivalent
of Euclid's parallel postulate. In (8) we give the most classical theorem
of triangle geometry; this chapter is included mainly as an illustration.

    In the following two chapters we discuss the geometry of circles on the
Euclidean plane: (9) Inscribed angles; (10) Inversion. It will be used to
construct the model of the hyperbolic plane.

    Further, we discuss non-Euclidean geometry: (11) Neutral geometry
geometry without the parallel postulate; (12) Conformal disc model this
is a construction of the hyperbolic plane, an example of a neutral plane
which is not Euclidean. In (13) we discuss geometry of the constructed
hyperbolic plane this is the highest point in the book.

    In the remaining chapters, we discuss some additional topics: (14)
Affine geometry; (15) Projective geometry; (16) Spherical geometry; (17)
Projective model of the hyperbolic plane; (18) Complex coordinates; (19)
Geometric constructions; (20) Area. The proofs in these chapters are not
completely rigorous.

    We encourage the use of visual assignments at the author's website.

Preliminaries

What is the axiomatic approach?

In the axiomatic approach, one defines the plane as anything that satis-
fies a given list of properties. These properties are called axioms. The
axiomatic system for the theory is like the rules for a game. Once the
axiom system is fixed, a statement is considered to be true if it follows
from the axioms and nothing else is considered to be true.

    The formulations of the first axioms were not rigorous at all. For
example, Euclid described a line as breadthless length and a straight line
as a line that lies evenly with the points on itself. On the other hand,
these formulations were sufficiently clear so that one mathematician could
understand the other.

    The best way to understand an axiomatic system is to make one by
yourself. Look around and choose a physical model of the Euclidean plane;
imagine an infinite and perfect surface of a chalkboard. Now try to collect
the key observations about this model. Assume for now that we have an
intuitive understanding of such notions as line and point.

  (i) We can measure distances between points.
  (ii) We can draw a unique line that passes thru two given points.
 (iii) We can measure angles.
 (iv) If we rotate or shift we will not see the difference.
  (v) If we change the scale we will not see the difference.
These observations are good to start with. Further we will develop the
language to reformulate them rigorously.

What is a model?

The Euclidean plane can be defined rigorously the following way:
    Define a point in the Euclidean plane as a pair of real numbers (x, y)

and define the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) by the
following formula:

                                  (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2.

    That is it! We gave a numerical model of the Euclidean plane; it builds
the Euclidean plane from real numbers while the latter is assumed to be
known.

    Shortness is the main advantage of the model approach, but it is not
intuitively clear why we define points and the distances this way.

    On the other hand, the observations made in the previous section
are intuitively obvious this is the main advantage of the axiomatic
approach.

    Another advantage lies in the fact that the axiomatic approach is
easily adjustable. For example, we may remove one axiom from the list, or
exchange it to another axiom. We will do such modifications in Chapter 11
and further.

Metric spaces

The notion of metric space provides a rigorous way to say: "we can mea-
sure distances between points". That is, instead of (i) on page 9, we can
say "Euclidean plane is a metric space".

1.1. Definition. Let X be a nonempty set and d be a function that
returns a real number d(A, B) for any pair A, B  X . Then d is called
metric on X if for any A, B, C  X , the following conditions are satisfied:

  (a) Positiveness:
                                           d(A, B) 0.

(b) A = B if and only if

                          d(A, B) = 0.

(c) Symmetry:

                          d(A, B) = d(B, A).

(d) Triangle inequality:

               d(A, C) d(A, B) + d(B, C).

A metric space is a set with a metric on it. More formally, a metric space
is a pair (X , d) where X is a set and d is a metric on X .

    The elements of X are called points of the metric space. Given two
points A, B  X , the value d(A, B) is called distance from A to B.
                                                                                             11

Examples

     Discrete metric. Let X be an arbitrary set. For any A, B  X , set
       d(A, B) = 0 if A = B and d(A, B) = 1 otherwise. The metric d is
       called discrete metric on X .

     Real line. Set of all real numbers (R) with metric d defined by
                                       d(A, B) := |A - B|.

1.2. Exercise. Show that d(A, B) = |A - B|2 is not a metric on R.
     Metrics on the plane. Suppose that R2 denotes the set of all pairs
       (x, y) of real numbers. Assume A = (xA, yA) and B = (xB, yB).
       Consider the following metrics on R2:
            Euclidean metric, denoted by d2, and defined as
                             d2(A, B) = (xA - xB )2 + (yA - yB)2.

            Manhattan metric, denoted by d1 and defined as
                                d1(A, B) = |xA - xB | + |yA - yB|.

            Maximum metric, denoted by d and defined as
                            d(A, B) = max{|xA - xB|, |yA - yB|}.

1.3. Exercise. Prove that the following functions are metrics on R2:
(a) d1; (b) d2; (c) d.

Shortcut for distance

Most of the time, we study only one metric on space. Therefore, we will
not need to name the metric each time.

    Given a metric space X , the distance between points A and B will be
further denoted by

                                  AB or dX (A, B);
the latter is used only if we need to emphasize that A and B are points
of the metric space X .

    For example, the triangle inequality can be written as

                                    AC AB + BC.
    For the multiplication, we will always use " ·", so AB could not be
confused with A·B.
1.4. Exercise. Show that the inequality

                        AB + P Q AP + AQ + BP + P Q
holds for any four points A, B, P , Q in a metric space.
12  CHAPTER 1. PRELIMINARIES

Isometries, motions, and lines

In this section, we define lines in a metric space. Once it is done the
sentence "We can draw a unique line that passes thru two given points."
becomes rigorous; see (ii) on page 9.

    Recall that a map f : X  Y is a bijection if it gives an exact pairing
of the elements of two sets. Equivalently, f : X  Y is a bijection if it
has an inverse; that is, a map g : Y  X such that g(f (A)) = A for any
A  X and f (g(B)) = B for any B  Y.

    Let X and Y be two metric spaces and dX , dY be their metrics. A
map

                                         f: X Y

is called distance-preserving if

                             dY (f (A), f (B)) = dX (A, B)

for any A, B  X .
    A bijective distance-preserving map is called an isometry.
    Two metric spaces are called isometric if there exists an isometry from

one to the other.
    The isometry from a metric space to itself is also called a motion of

the space.

1.5. Exercise. Show that any distance-preserving map is injective; that
is, if f : X  Y is a distance-preserving map, then f (A) = f (B) for any
pair of distinct points A, B  X .

1.6. Exercise. Show that if f : R  R is a motion of the real line, then
either (a) f (x) = f (0) + x for any x  R, or (b) f (x) = f (0) - x for any
x  R.

1.7. Exercise. Prove that (R2, d1) is isometric to (R2, d).

1.8. Advanced exercise. Describe all the motions of the Manhattan
plane, defined on page 11.

    If X is a metric space and Y is a subset of X , then a metric on Y
can be obtained by restricting the metric from X . In other words, the
distance between two points of Y is defined to be the distance between
these points in X . This way any subset of a metric space can be also
considered as a metric space.

1.9. Definition. A subset  of metric space is called a line, if it is
isometric to the real line.
                                                                                             13

    A triple of points that lie on one line is called collinear. Note that if A,
B, and C are collinear, AC AB and AC BC, then AC = AB + BC.

    Some metric spaces have no lines; for example, discrete metrics. The
picture shows examples of lines on the Manhattan plane (R2, d1).

1.10. Exercise. Consider the graph y = |x| in R2. In which of the
following spaces (a) (R2, d1), (b) (R2, d2), (c) (R2, d) does it form a
line? Why?

1.11. Exercise. Show that any motion maps a line to a line.

Half-lines and segments

Assume there is a line  passing thru two distinct points P and Q. In
this case, we might denote  as (P Q). There might be more than one line
thru P and Q, but if we write (P Q) we assume that we made a choice of
such line.

    We will denote by [P Q) the half-line that starts at P and contains Q.
Formally speaking, [P Q) is a subset of (P Q) which corresponds to [0, )
under an isometry f : (P Q)  R such that f (P ) = 0 and f (Q) > 0.

    The subset of line (P Q) between P and Q is called the segment be-
tween P and Q and denoted by [P Q]. Formally, the segment can be
defined as the intersection of two half-lines: [P Q] = [P Q)  [QP ).
1.12. Exercise. Show that

  (a) if X  [P Q), then QX = |P X - P Q|;
  (b) if X  [P Q], then QX + XQ = P Q.
14                              CHAPTER 1. PRELIMINARIES

Angles

Our next goal is to introduce angles and angle measures; after that,

the statement "we can measure angles" will become rigorous; see (iii)

on page 9.

    An ordered pair of half-lines that start at the same point is called an

angle. The angle AOB (also denoted by AOB) is the pair of half-lines

[OA) and [OB). In this case, the point O is called the vertex of the angle.

    Intuitively, the angle measure tells how much one has to rotate the

first half-line counterclockwise, so it gets the position of the second half-

line of the angle. The full turn is assumed to be 2·; it corresponds to

the angle measure in radians.1

    The angle measure of AOB is denoted by AOB; it is a real number

in the interval (-, ].

               The notations AOB and AOB look similar; they

    B          also have close but different meanings which better

               not be confused. For example, the equality AOB =

               AOB means that [OA) = [OA) and [OB) =

               = [OB); in particular, O = O. On the other hand,

O A the equality AOB = AOB means only equality
                      of two real numbers; in this case, O may be distinct

               from O.

    Here is the first property of angle measure which will become a part

of the axiom.

    Given a half-line [OA) and   (-, ] there is a unique half-line

[OB) such that AOB = .

Reals modulo 2·

Consider three half-lines starting from the same point, [OA), [OB), and
[OC). They make three angles AOB, BOC, and AOC, so the value
AOC should coincide with the sum AOB + BOC up to full rotation.
This property will be expressed by the formula

                              AOB + BOC  AOC,

where "" is a new notation which we are about to introduce. The last
identity will become a part of the axioms.

    We will write    (mod 2·), or briefly

                                            

    1For a while you may think that  is a positive real number that measures the size
of a half turn in certain units. Its concrete value   3.14 will not be important for a
long time.

if  =  + 2··n for some integer n. In this case, we say

              " is equal to  modulo 2·".

For example,

              -    3·  and  1  ·       - 32  ·.
                            2

The introduced relation "" behaves as an equality sign, but

              · · ·   - 2·     + 2·   + 4·  . . . ;

that is, if the angle measures differ by full turn, then they are considered
to be the same.

    With "", we can do addition, subtraction, and multiplication with
integer numbers without getting into trouble. That is, if

                 and   ,

then

       +    + ,  -    -  and n·  n·

for any integer n. But "" does not in general respect multiplication with
non-integer numbers; for example,

                -  but  1   ·    - 12  ·.
                        2

1.13. Exercise. Show that 2·  0 if and only if   0 or   .

Continuity

The angle measure is also assumed to be continuous. Namely, the follow-
ing property of angle measure will become a part of the axioms:

    The function
                                 : (A, O, B)  AOB

is continuous at any triple of points (A, O, B) such that O = A and O = B
and AOB = .

    To explain this property, we need to extend the notion of continuity to
the functions between metric spaces. The definition is a straightforward
generalization of the standard definition for real-to-real functions.

    Further, let X and Y be two metric spaces, and dX , dY be their metrics.
    A map f : X  Y is called continuous at point A  X if for any  > 0
there is  > 0, such that

                   dX (A, A) <   dY (f (A), f (A)) < .
16  CHAPTER 1. PRELIMINARIES

(Informally it means that sufficiently small changes of A result in arbi-
trarily small changes of f (A).)

    A map f : X  Y is called continuous if it is continuous at every point
A  X.

    One may define a continuous map of several variables the same way.
Assume f (A, B, C) is a function that returns a point in the space Y for
a triple of points (A, B, C) in the space X . The map f might be defined
only for some triples in X .

    Assume f (A, B, C) is defined. Then, we say that f is continuous at
the triple (A, B, C) if for any  > 0 there is  > 0 such that

                          dY (f (A, B, C), f (A, B, C)) < .

if dX (A, A) < , dX (B, B) < , and dX (C, C) < .

1.14. Exercise. Let X be a metric space.
  (a) Let A  X be a fixed point. Show that the function

                                        f (B) := dX (A, B)

       is continuous at any point B.
  (b) Show that dX (A, B) is continuous at any pair A, B  X .

1.15. Exercise. Let X , Y, and Z be metric spaces. Assume that the
functions f : X  Y and g : Y  Z are continuous at any point, and
h = g  f is their composition; that is, h(A) = g(f (A)) for any A  X .
Show that h : X  Z is continuous at any point.

1.16. Exercise. Show that any distance-preserving map is continuous
at any point.

Congruent triangles

Our next goal is to give a rigorous meaning for (iv) on page 9. To do
this, we introduce the notion of congruent triangles so instead of "if we
rotate or shift we will not see the difference" we say that for triangles, the
side-angle-side congruence holds; that is, two triangles are congruent if
they have two pairs of equal sides and the same angle measure between
these sides.

    An ordered triple of distinct points in a metric space X , say A, B, C,
is called a triangle ABC (briefly ABC). Note that the triangles ABC
and ACB are considered as different.

    Two triangles ABC and ABC are called congruent (it can be written
as ABC = ABC) if there is a motion f : X  X such that

                   A = f (A), B = f (B) and C = f (C).
                                                                17

    Let X be a metric space, and f, g : X  X be two motions. Note that
the inverse f -1 : X  X , as well as the composition f  g : X  X , are
also motions.

    It follows that "=" is an equivalence relation; that is, any triangle
congruent to itself, and the following two conditions hold:

     If ABC = ABC, then ABC = ABC.
     If ABC = ABC and ABC = ABC, then

                                     ABC = ABC.

    Note that if ABC = ABC, then AB = AB, BC = BC and
CA = CA.

    For a discrete metric, as well as some other metrics, the converse
also holds. The following example shows that it does not hold in the
Manhattan plane:

Example. Consider three points A = (0, 1), B = (1, 0), and C = (-1, 0)
on the Manhattan plane (R2, d1). Note that

              d1(A, B) = d1(A, C) = d1(B, C) = 2.

On one hand,  ABC = ACB.

Indeed, the map (x, y)  (-x, y) is a motion of (R2, d1) that sends A 
 A, B  C, and C  B.

    On the other hand,

              ABC  BCA.

Indeed, arguing by contradiction, assume that ABC = BCA; that is,
there is a motion f of (R2, d1) that sends A  B, B  C, and C  A.

    We say that M is a midpoint of A and B if AAAA

d1(A, M )  =  d1(B, M )  =  1  ·  d1  (A,  B  ).
                            2

Note that a point M is a midpoint of A and B if C               B

and only if f (M ) is a midpoint of B and C.

The set of midpoints for A and B is infinite, it contains all points (t, t)

for t  [0, 1] (it is the gray segment on the picture above). On the other

hand, the midpoint for B and C is unique (it is the black point on the

picture). Thus, the map f cannot be bijective a contradiction.
Chapter 2

Axioms

A system of axioms appears already in Euclid's "Elements" the most
successful and influential textbook ever written.

    The systematic study of geometries as axiomatic systems was triggered
by the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. The branch of mathematics,
emerging this way, is called "Foundations of geometry".

    The most popular system of axioms was proposed in 1899 by David
Hilbert. This is also the first rigorous system by modern standards. It
contains twenty axioms in five groups, six "primitive notions", and three
"primitive terms"; these are not defined in terms of previously defined
concepts.

    Later many different systems were proposed. It is worth mentioning
the system of Alexandr Alexandrov [2] which is very intuitive and ele-
mentary, the system of Friedrich Bachmann [3] based on the concept of
symmetry, and the system of Alfred Tarski [18] a minimalist system
designed for analysis using mathematical logic.

    We will use another system which is very close to the one proposed
by George Birkhoff [5]. This system is based on the key observations
(i)-(v) listed on page 9. The axioms use the notions of metric space,
lines, angles, triangles, equalities modulo 2· (), the continuity of maps
between metric spaces, and the congruence of triangles (=). All this is
discussed in the preliminaries.

    Our system is built upon metric spaces. In particular, we use real
numbers as a building block. By that reason our approach is not purely
axiomatic we build the theory upon something else; it resembles a
model-based introduction to Euclidean geometry discussed on page 10.
We used this approach to minimize the tedious parts which are unavoid-
able in purely axiomatic foundations.

                                              18
                                                                                             19

The axioms

  I. The Euclidean plane is a metric space with at least two points.
 II. There is one and only one line, that contains any two given

     distinct points P and Q in the Euclidean plane.
III. Any angle AOB in the Euclidean plane defines a real number

     in the interval (-, ]. This number is called the angle measure
     of AOB and denoted by AOB. It satisfies the following
     conditions:

     (a) Given a half-line [OA) and   (-, ], there is a unique
           half-line [OB), such that AOB = .

     (b) For any points A, B, and C, distinct from O we have

                               AOB + BOC  AOC.

(c) The function

                   : (A, O, B)  AOB

           is continuous at any triple of points (A, O, B), such that
           O = A and O = B and AOB = .

IV. In the Euclidean plane, we have ABC = ABC if and only
     if

AB = AB, AC = AC, and CAB = ±CAB.

V. If for two triangles ABC, ABC in the Euclidean plane and for
    k > 0 we have

        B  [AB),    C  [AC),
      AB = k·AB,  AC = k·AC,

then

BC = k·BC, ABC = ABC, ACB = ACB.

From now on, we can use no information about the Euclidean plane that
does not follow from the five axioms above.

2.1. Exercise. Show that there are (a) an infinite set of points, (b) an
infinite set of lines on the plane.
20                         CHAPTER 2. AXIOMS

Lines and half-lines

2.2. Proposition.  Any two distinct lines intersect at most at one
point.

Proof. Assume that two lines  and m intersect at two distinct points P
and Q. Applying Axiom II, we get that  = m.

2.3. Exercise. Suppose A  [OA) and A = O. Show that
                                      [OA) = [OA).

2.4. Proposition. Given r  0 and a half-line [OA) there is a unique
A  [OA) such that OA = r.

Proof. According to the definition of half-line, there is an isometry

                                    f : [OA)  [0, ),

such that f (O) = 0. By the definition of isometry, OA = f (A) for any
A  [OA). Thus, OA = r if and only if f (A) = r.

    Since isometry has to be bijective, the statement follows.

Zero angle

2.5. Proposition. AOA = 0 for any A = O.

Proof. According to Axiom IIIb,

                              AOA + AOA  AOA.

Subtract AOA from both sides, we get that AOA  0.
    By Axiom III, - < AOA ; therefore AOA = 0.

2.6. Exercise. Assume AOB = 0. Show that [OA) = [OB).

2.7. Proposition.  For any A and B distinct from O, we have
                        AOB  -BOA.

Proof. According to Axiom IIIb,

                              AOB + BOA  AOA

By Proposition 2.5, AOA = 0. Hence the result.

         A statement marked with " " if Axiom V was not used in its proof. Ignore this
mark for a while; it will be important in Chapter 11, see page 81.
                                                               21

Straight angle

If AOB = , we say that AOB is a straight angle. Note that by
Proposition 2.7, if AOB is straight, then so is BOA.

    We say that the point O lies between points A and B, if O = A,
O = B, and O  [AB].

2.8. Theorem. The angle AOB is straight if and only if O lies between
A and B.

Proof. By Proposition 2.4, we may assume
that OA = OB = 1.

"If " part. Assume O lies between A and B. B    O           A

Set  = AOB.

Applying Axiom IIIa, we get a half-line [OA) such that  = BOA.

By Proposition 2.4, we can assume that OA = 1. According to Axiom IV,

             AOB = BOA.

Suppose that f denotes the corresponding motion of the plane; that is, f

is a motion such that f (A) = B, f (O) = O, and f (B) = A.

Then

                                                

(AB) = f ((AB))  f (O) = O.                                 A

                                          B     O

Therefore, both lines (AB) and (AB) con-                    A
tain B and O. By Axiom II, (AB) = (AB).

By the definition of the line, (AB) contains exactly two points A and

B on distance 1 from O. Since OA = 1 and A = B, we get that A = A.

By Axiom IIIb and Proposition 2.5, we get that

             2· = AOB + BOA =
                  = AOB + BOA 
                   AOA =
                  =0

Therefore, by Exercise 1.13,  is either 0 or .
    Since [OA) = [OB), we have that  = 0, see Exercise 2.6. Therefore,

 = .

"Only if " part. Suppose that AOB = . Consider the line (OA) and
choose a point B on (OA) so that O lies between A and B.

    From above, we have that AOB = . Applying Axiom IIIa, we get
that [OB) = [OB). In particular, O lies between A and B.
22                           CHAPTER 2. AXIOMS

    A triangle ABC is called degenerate if A, B, and C lie on one line.
The following corollary is just a reformulation of Theorem 2.8.

2.9. Corollary. A triangle is degenerate if and only if one of its angles
is equal to  or 0. Moreover, in a degenerate triangle, the angle measures
are 0, 0, and .

2.10. Exercise. Show that three distinct points A, O, and B lie on one
line if and only if

                                      2·AOB  0.

2.11. Exercise. Let A, B and C be three points distinct from O. Show
that B, O and C lie on one line if and only if

                                 2·AOB  2·AOC.

2.12. Exercise. Show that there is a nondegenerate triangle.

Vertical angles

A pair of angles AOB and AOB is called vertical if the point O lies
between A and A and between B and B at the same time.

2.13. Proposition. The vertical angles have equal measures.

Proof. Assume that the angles AOB and AOB are vertical. Note that
AOA and BOB are straight. Therefore, AOA = BOB = .

                            It follows that

A B            0 = AOA - BOB 
B O A             AOB + BOA - BOA - AOB 
                  AOB - AOB.

Since - < AOB   and - < AOB  , we get that AOB =
= AOB.

2.14. Exercise. Assume O is the midpoint for both segments [AB] and
[CD]. Prove that AC = BD.
Chapter 3

Half-planes

This chapter contains long proofs of intuitively evident statements. It is
okay to skip it, but make sure you know definitions of positive/negative
angles and that your intuition agrees with 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, 3.12, and 3.17.

Sign of an angle

The positive and negative angles can be visualized as counterclockwise
and clockwise directions; formally, they are defined the following way:

     The angle AOB is called positive if 0 < AOB < ;
     The angle AOB is called negative if AOB < 0.
    Note that according to the above definitions the straight angle, as well
as the zero angle, are neither positive nor negative.

3.1. Exercise. Show that AOB is positive if and only if BOA is
negative.

3.2. Lemma. Let AOB be straight. Then AOX is positive if and
only if BOX is negative.

Proof. Set  = AOX and  = BOX. Since AOB is straight,

              -   .

    It follows that  =    = 0 and  = 0   = . In these two
cases, the sign of AOX and BOX are undefined.

    In the remaining cases we have that || <  and || < . If  and 
have the same sign, then | - | < ; the latter contradicts . Hence the
statement follows.

             23
24                     CHAPTER 3. HALF-PLANES

3.3. Exercise. Assume that the angles ABC and ABC have the same
sign and

                                2·ABC  2·ABC.

Show that ABC = ABC.

Intermediate value theorem

3.4. Intermediate value theorem. Let f : [a, b]  R be a continuous

function. Assume f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, then f (t0) = 0 for
some t0  [a, b].

    The intermediate value theorem is assumed f (b)
to be known; it should be covered in any cal-
                                                     a
culus course. We will use only the following
                                                        t0
corollary:                                                  b

3.5. Corollary. Assume that for any t  f (a)

 [0, 1] we have three points in the plane Ot,

At, and Bt, such that

(a) Each function t  Ot, t  At, and t  Bt is continuous.

(b) For any t  [0, 1], the points Ot, At, and Bt do not lie on one line.

Then A0O0B0 and A1O1B1 have the same sign.

Proof. Consider the function f (t) = AtOtBt.
    Since the points Ot, At, and Bt do not lie on one line, Theorem 2.8

implies that f (t) = AtOtBt = 0 nor  for any t  [0, 1].
    Therefore, by Axiom IIIc and Exercise 1.15, f is a continuous function.

By the intermediate value theorem, f (0) and f (1) have the same sign;
hence the result follows.

                                                     Q Q P
3.6. Lemma. Assume Q  [P Q) and Q = P .
Then for any X / (P Q) the angles P QX and
P QX have the same sign.

Proof. By Proposition 2.4, for any t  [0, 1] there
is a unique point Qt  [P Q) such that

              P Qt = (1 - t)·P Q + t·P Q.
                                                                 25

Note that the map t  Qt is continuous,

Q0 = Q,                                 Q1 = Q

and for any t  [0, 1], we have that P = Qt.

    Applying Corollary 3.5, for Pt = P , Qt, and Xt = X, we get that
P QX has the same sign as P QX.

3.7. Signs of angles of a triangle. In arbitrary nondegenerate tri-
angle ABC, the angles ABC, BCA, and CAB have the same sign.

Proof. Choose a point Z  (AB) so that A lies                  C
between B and Z.                                        B AZ

    According to Lemma 3.6, the angles ZBC and
ZAC have the same sign.

    Note that ABC = ZBC and

                  ZAC + CAB  .

Therefore, CAB has the same sign as ZAC which in turn has the same
sign as ABC = ZBC.

    Repeating the same argument for BCA and CAB, we get the re-
sult.

3.8. Lemma. Assume [XY ] does not intersect (P Q), then the angles
P QX and P QY have the same sign.

The proof is nearly identical to the one above.            X

Proof. According to Proposition 2.4, for any t  [0, 1]

there is a point Xt  [XY ], such that                         Y

XXt = t·XY.                                             Q     P

Note that the map t  Xt is continuous. Moreover,
X0 = X, X1 = Y , and Xt / (QP ) for any t  [0, 1].

    Applying Corollary 3.5, for Pt = P , Qt = Q, and Xt, we get that
P QX has the same sign as P QY .

Half-planes

3.9. Proposition. Assume X, Y / (P Q). Then the angles P QX and
P QY have the same sign if and only if [XY ] does not intersect (P Q).
26                                 CHAPTER 3. HALF-PLANES

        X Proof. The if-part follows from Lemma 3.8.

                     Assume [XY ] intersects (P Q); suppose that Z

    PQ           Z denotes the point of intersection. Without loss of generality, we can assume Z = P .
                            Note that Z lies between X and Y . According

                     to Lemma 3.2, P ZX and P ZY have opposite

                 Y signs. It proves the statement if Z = Q.

                     If Z = Q, then ZQX and QZX have oppo-

site signs by 3.7. In the same way, we get that ZQY and QZY have

opposite signs.

    If Q lies between Z and P , then by Lemma 3.2 two pairs of angles

P QX, ZQX and P QY , ZQY have opposite signs. It follows that

P QX and P QY have opposite signs as required.

    In the remaining case [QZ) = [QP ) and therefore P QX = ZQX

and P QY = ZQY . Therefore again P QX and P QY have opposite

signs as required.

3.10. Corollary. The complement of a line (P Q) in the plane can be
presented in a unique way as a union of two disjoint subsets called half-
planes such that

  (a) Two points X, Y / (P Q) lie in the same half-plane if and only if
       the angles P QX and P QY have the same sign.

  (b) Two points X, Y / (P Q) lie in the same half-plane if and only if
       [XY ] does not intersect (P Q).

    We say that X and Y lie on one side of (P Q) if

they lie in one of the half-planes of (P Q) and we say               B

that P and Q lie on the opposite sides of  if they lie

in the different half-planes of .                       A O

3.11. Exercise. Suppose that the angles AOB and
AOB are vertical and B / (OA). Show that the line B
                                                                  A
(AB) does not intersect the segment [AB].

    Consider the triangle ABC. The segments [AB], [BC], and [CA] are
called sides of the triangle.

3.12. Pasch's theorem. Assume line  does not            B
pass thru any vertex of a triangle. Then it intersects          
either two or zero sides of the triangle.

Proof. Assume that line  intersects side [AB] of the

triangle ABC and does not pass thru A, B, and C.                     C

    By Corollary 3.10, the vertices A and B lie on A

opposite sides of .

    The vertex C may lie on the same side with A and on the opposite
side with B or the other way around. By Corollary 3.10, in the first case,
 intersects side [BC] and does not intersect [AC]; in the second case, 
intersects side [AC] and does not intersect [BC]. Hence the statement
follows.

3.13. Exercise. Show that two points X, Y /                  X

/ (P Q) lie on the same side of (P Q) if and only

if the angles P XQ and P Y Q have the same sign.               Y

3.14. Exercise. Let ABC be a nondegenerate             P          Q
triangle, A  [BC] and B  [AC]. Show that the                C
segments [AA] and [BB] intersect.                                 A
                                                      B              B
3.15. Exercise. Assume that points X and Y lie
on opposite sides of the line (P Q). Show that the  A
half-line [P X) does not intersect [QY ).

3.16. Advanced exercise. Note that the following quantity

~ ABC =                                  if ABC = 

         -ABC if ABC < 

can serve as the angle measure; that is, the axioms hold if one exchanges
 to ~ everywhere.

    Show that  and ~ are the only possible angle measures on the plane.
    Show that without Axiom IIIc, this is no longer true.

Triangle with the given sides

Consider the triangle ABC. Set

a = BC,                         b = CA,             c = AB.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that

          a b c.

Then all three triangle inequalities for ABC hold if and only if

          c a + b.

The following theorem states that this is the only restriction on a, b, and c.

3.17. Theorem. Assume that 0 < a b c a + b. Then there is a
triangle with sides a, b, and c; that is, there is ABC such that a = BC,
b = CA, and c = AB.

       B                 The proof is given at the end of the section.
                         Assume r > 0 and  >  > 0. Consider the trian-
                     gle ABC such that AB = BC = r and ABC = .
                     The existence of such a triangle follows from Ax-
    r     r          iom IIIa and Proposition 2.4.
                         Note that according to Axiom IV, the values 
A s(, r) C           and r define the triangle ABC up to the congru-
                     ence. In particular, the distance AC depends only
                     on  and r. Set

                      s(, r) := AC.

3.18. Proposition. Given r > 0 and  > 0, there is  > 0 such that
                            0 <  <  = s(r, ) < .

Proof. Fix two points A and B such that AB = r.

                      Choose a point X such that ABX is pos-

                  X   itive. Let Y  [AX) be the point such that

                  Y   AY = 2 ; it exists by Proposition 2.4.

          C           Note that X and Y lie on the same side of
                   Z
       r              (AB); therefore, ABY is positive. Set  =

                  D   = ABY .

BrA                   Suppose 0 <  < ; by Axiom IIIa, we can

                      choose C so that ABC =  and BC = r.

Further we can choose a half-line [BZ) such that ABZ = 12 ·.
    Note that A and Y lie on opposite sides of (BZ) and ABZ 

 -CBZ. In particular, (BZ) intersects [AY ]; denote by D the point

of intersection.

    Since D lies between A and Y , we have that AD < AY .

    Since D lies on (BZ) we have that ABD  -CBD. By Axiom IV,
ABD = CBD. It follows that

                      s(r, ) = AC
                                  AD + DC =

                               = 2·AD <
                               < 2·AY =
                               =

3.19. Corollary. Fix a real number r > 0 and two distinct points A
and B. Then for any real number   [0, ], there is a unique point C
                                                        29

such that BC = r and ABC = . Moreover,   C is a continuous
map from [0, ] to the plane.

Proof. The existence and uniqueness of C follow from Axiom IIIa and
Proposition 2.4.

    Note that if 1 = 2, then

                               C1 C2 = s(r, |1 - 2|).

    By Proposition 3.18, the map   C is continuous.

Proof of Theorem 3.17. Fix the points A and B such that AB = c. Given
  [0, ], suppose that C denotes the point in the plane such that
BC = a and ABC = .

    According to Corollary 3.19, the map   C is continuous. There-
fore, the function b() = AC is continuous (formally, it follows from
Exercise 1.14 and Exercise 1.15).

    Note that b(0) = c - a and b() = c + a. Since c - a b c + a, by the
intermediate value theorem (3.4) there is 0  [0, ] such that b(0) = b,
hence the result.

    Given a positive real number r and a point O, the set  of all points
on distance r from O is called a circle with radius r and center O.

3.20. Exercise. Show that two circles in-
tersect if and only if

|R - r| d R + r,                            R  dddd  r

where R and r denote their radiuses, and d
   the distance between their centers.

Congruent triangles

Side-angle-side condition

Our next goal is to give conditions that guarantee congruence of two
triangles.

    One of such conditions is given in Axiom IV; it states that if two pairs
of sides of two triangles are equal, and the included angles are equal up
to sign, then the triangles are congruent. This axiom is also called side-
angle-side congruence condition, or briefly, SAS congruence condition.

Angle-side-angle condition

4.1. ASA condition. Assume that
      AB = AB, ABC = ±ABC, CAB = ±CAB

and ABC is nondegenerate. Then
                                  ABC = ABC.

    Note that for degenerate triangles the statement does not hold. For
example, consider one triangle with sides 1, 4, 5 and the other with sides
2, 3, 5.
Proof. According to Theorem 3.7, either

                                   ABC = ABC,
  CAB = CAB

                                              30
                                                               31

or
                                 ABC = -ABC,

  CAB = -CAB.

Further we assume that  holds; the case  is analogous.

Let C be the point on the half-line [AC) such               B

that AC = AC.
By Axiom IV, ABC = ABC. Applying Ax-

iom IV again, we get that

ABC = ABC = ABC.

By Axiom IIIa, [BC) = [BC). Hence C lies on A                  C C
(BC) as well as on (AC).

Since ABC is not degenerate, (AC) is distinct from (BC). Ap-

plying Axiom II, we get that C = C.
    Therefore, ABC = ABC = ABC.

Isosceles triangles

A triangle with two equal sides is called isosceles; the remaining side is
called the base.

4.2. Theorem.     Assume ABC is an isosceles triangle with the base
[AB]. Then                 ABC  -BAC.

Moreover, the converse holds if ABC is nondegenerate.

The following proof is due to Pappus of Alexandria.

Proof. Note that                                            C

CA = CB, CB = CA, ACB  -BCA.

By Axiom IV,

                  CAB = CBA.

Applying the theorem on the signs of angles of triangles A     B

(3.7) and Axiom IV again, we get that

                           BAC  -ABC.

    To prove the converse, we assume that CAB  -CBA. By ASA
condition (4.1), CAB = CBA. Therefore, CA = CB.

A triangle with three equal sides is called equilateral.

4.3. Exercise. Let ABC be an equilateral triangle. Show that

                  ABC = BCA = CAB.
32                     CHAPTER 4. CONGRUENT TRIANGLES

Side-side-side condition

4.4. SSS condition. ABC = ABC if
                 AB = AB, BC = BC and CA = CA.

    Note that this condition is valid for degenerate triangles as well.
Proof. Choose C so that AC = AC and BAC = BAC. Ac-
cording to Axiom IV,

                                  ABC = ABC.

    It will suffice to prove that

                 ABC = ABC.

The condition  trivially holds if C = C. Thus, it remains to consider

the case C = C.

                 Clearly, the corresponding sides of ABC and

    C            ABC are equal. Hence the triangles CAC

                 and CBC are isosceles. By Theorem 4.2, we

                 have

A            B                     ACC  -ACC,
                                   CCB  -CCB.

                  Adding them, we get that
    C 

                                    ACB  -ACB.

Applying Axiom IV again, we get .

4.5. Corollary. If AB + BC = AC, then B  [AC].

Proof. Since AB + BC = AC, we can choose B  [AC] such that

AB = AB; observe that BC = BC.

    We may assume that AB > 0 and BC > 0; otherwise, A = B or

B = C, and the statement follows. In this case, ABC = .

    By SSS,            ABC = ABC.

Therefore ABC = . By Theorem 2.8, B lies between A and C.

4.6. Advanced exercise. Let M be the midpoint of the side [AB] of
ABC and M  be the midpoint of the side [AB] of ABC. Assume
CA = CA, CB = CB, and CM  = CM . Prove that

                 ABC = ABC.

4.7. Exercise. Let ABC be an isosceles triangle        C
with the base [AB]. Suppose that CA = CB for some
points A  [BC] and B  [AC]. Show that               B     A

  (a) AAC = BBC;
  (b) ABB = BAA.

4.8. Exercise. Let ABC be a nondegenerate tri- A          B

angle and let f be a motion of the plane such that

          f (A) = A, f (B) = B, and f (C) = C.

    Show that f is the identity map; that is, f (X) = X for any point X
on the plane.

On side-side-angle and side-angle-angle

In each of the conditions SAS, ASA, and SSS we specify three correspond-
ing parts of the triangles. Let us discuss other triples of corresponding
parts.

    The first triple is called side-side-angle, or briefly SSA; it specifies two
sides and a non-included angle. This condition is not sufficient for con-
gruence; that is, there are two nondegenerate triangles ABC and ABC
such that

          AB = AB, BC = BC, BAC  ±BAC,

but ABC = ABC and AC = AC.                             B

We will not use this negative statement in the

sequel and therefore there is no need to prove it

formally. An example can be guessed from the

diagram.

The second triple is side-angle-angle, or

briefly SAA; it specifies one side and two an- A C        C

gles one of which is opposite to the side. This

provides a congruence condition; that is, if one of the triangles ABC

or ABC is nondegenerate and AB = AB, ABC  ±ABC,
BCA  ±BCA, then ABC = ABC.

The SAA condition will not be used directly in the sequel. One proof

of this condition can be obtained from ASA and the theorem on the sum

of angles of a triangle proved below (see 7.12). For a more direct proof,

see Exercise 11.6.

Another triple is called angle-angle-angle, or briefly AAA; by Axiom V,

it is not a congruence condition in the Euclidean plane, but in the hyper-

bolic plane it is; see 13.8.
Chapter 5

Perpendicular lines

Right, acute and obtuse angles

     If |AOB| = 2 , we say that AOB is right ;
     If |AOB| < 2 , we say that AOB is acute;
     If |AOB| > 2 , we say that AOB is obtuse.
    On the diagrams, the right angles will be marked
with a little square, as shown.
    If AOB is right, we say also that [OA) is perpendicular to [OB); it
will be written as [OA)  [OB).
    From Theorem 2.8, it follows that two lines (OA) and (OB) are ap-
propriately called perpendicular, if [OA)  [OB). In this case, we also
write (OA)  (OB).
5.1. Exercise. Assume point O lies between A and B and X = O. Show
that XOA is acute if and only if XOB is obtuse.

Perpendicular bisector

Assume M is the midpoint of the segment [AB]; that is, M  (AB) and
AM = M B.

    The line  that passes thru M and perpendicular to (AB), is called
the perpendicular bisector to the segment [AB].
5.2. Theorem. Given distinct points A and B, all points equidistant
from A and B and no others lie on the perpendicular bisector to [AB].

                                              34
                                                               35

Proof. Let M be the midpoint of [AB].

Assume P A = P B and P = M . According                      P

to SSS (4.4), AM P = BM P . Hence

          AM P = ±BM P.

Since A = B, we have "-" in the above formula.
Further,

           = AM B                                     A     MB

           AM P + P M B 

           2·AM P.

That is, AM P = ± 2 . Therefore, P lies on the perpendicular bisector.
    To prove the converse, suppose P is any point on the perpendicular

bisector to [AB] and P = M . Then AM P = ± 2 , BM P = ± 2 and
AM = BM . By SAS, AM P = BM P ; in particular, AP = BP .

5.3. Exercise. Let  be the perpendicular bisector to the segment [AB]
and X be an arbitrary point on the plane.

    Show that AX < BX if and only if X and A lie on the same side
from .

5.4. Exercise. Let ABC be a nondegenerate triangle. Show that
                       AC > BC  |ABC| > |CAB|.

Uniqueness of a perpendicular

5.5. Theorem. There is one and only one line that passes thru a given
point P and is perpendicular to a given line .

    According to the above theorem, there is a unique point Q   such
that (QP )  . This point Q is called the foot point of P on .

Proof. If P  , then both existence and uniqueness follow from Axiom III.

Existence for P  . Let A and B be two dis-                      P

tinct points of . Choose P  so that AP  = AP                
                                                                     B
and BAP   -BAP . According to Axiom IV,
AP B = AP B. In particular, AP = AP  and                        P

BP = BP.                                                 A

According to Theorem 5.2, A and B lie on

the perpendicular bisector to [P P ]. In particular,

(P P )  (AB) = .
36                 CHAPTER 5. PERPENDICULAR LINES

Uniqueness for P  . From above we can                                             P

choose a point P  in such a way that 

forms the perpendicular bisector to [P P ].                                    m

    Assume m   and m  P . Then m is Q                                                Q
[QQ] of ; in particular, P Q = P Q. a perpendicular bisector to some segment 

    Since  is the perpendicular bisector to

[P P ], we get that P Q = P Q and P Q =                                           P

= P Q. Therefore,

                   P Q = P Q = P Q = P Q.

By Theorem 5.2, P  lies on the perpendicular bisector to [QQ], which
is m. By Axiom II, m = (P P ).

Reflection across a line

Assume the point P and the line (AB) are given. To find the reflection
P  of P across (AB), one drops a perpendicular from P onto (AB), and

continues it to the same distance on the other side.
    According to Theorem 5.5, P  is uniquely determined by P .
    Note that P = P  if and only if P  (AB).

5.6. Proposition. Assume P  is a reflection of the point P across
(AB). Then AP  = AP and if A = P , then BAP   -BAP .

Proof. Note that if P  (AB), then P = P . By Corollary 2.9, BAP = 0

or . Hence the statement follows.

    P              If P / (AB), then P  = P . By the con-

                   struction of P , the line (AB) is a perpendic-

                   ular bisector of [P P ]. Therefore, according

                   to Theorem 5.2, AP  = AP and BP  = BP .
                   In particular, ABP  = ABP . Therefore,

A                  B BAP  = ±BAP .

                   Since P  = P and AP  = AP , we get that

                   BAP  = BAP . That is, we are left with

    P              the case

                                   BAP  = -BAP.

5.7. Corollary. The reflection across a line is a motion of the plane.
Moreover, if P QR is the reflection of P QR, then

                                  QP R  -QP R.

Proof. Note that the composition of two reflections across the same line
is the identity map. In particular, any reflection is a bijection.
                                                               37

  Fix a line (AB) and two points P and Q; de- R
note their reflections across (AB) by P  and Q.
Let us show that                                    PQ

                 P Q = P Q;                      A  B

that is, the reflection is distance-preserving,          P  Q
    Without loss of generality, we may assume    R

that the points P and Q are distinct from A
and B. By Proposition 5.6, we get that

  BAP   -BAP,                    BAQ  -BAQ,
      AP  = AP,                      AQ = AQ.

It follows that

                 P AQ  -P AQ.

By SAS, P AQ = P AQ and  follows. Moreover, we also get that

                 AP Q  ±AP Q.

From  and the theorem on the signs of angles of triangles (3.7) we get

                 AP Q  -AP Q.

    Repeating the same argument for a pair of points P and R, we get
that

                 AP R  -AP R.

Subtracting  from , we get that

                 QP R  -QP R.

5.8. Exercise. Show that any motion of the plane can be presented as a
composition of at most three reflections across lines.

    The motions of the plane can be divided into two types, direct and
indirect. The motion f is direct if

                                   QP R = QP R

for any P QR and P  = f (P ), Q = f (Q) and R = f (R); if instead we
have

38              CHAPTER 5. PERPENDICULAR LINES

for any P QR, then the motion f is called indirect.
    Indeed, by Corollary 5.7, any reflection is an indirect motion. Applying

the exercise above, any motion is a composition of reflections. If the
number of reflections is odd then the composition indirect; if the number
is even, then the motion is direct.

5.9. Exercise. Let X and Y be the reflections of P across the lines (AB)
and (BC) respectively. Show that

Perpendicular is shortest

5.10. Lemma.    Assume Q is the foot point of P on the line . Then
the inequality                  PX > PQ

holds for any point X on  distinct from Q.

    If P , Q, and  are as above, then P Q is called the distance from P
to .

Proof. If P  , then the result follows since P Q = 0. Further we assume

that P / .

                Let P  be the reflection of P across the line . Note

    P           that Q is the midpoint of [P P ] and  is the perpendic-

                ular bisector of [P P ]. Therefore

                           P X = P X and P Q = P Q = 12 ·P P 
      Q     X

    P                 Note that  meets [P P ] only at the point Q. There-
                 fore, X / [P P ]; by the triangle inequality and Corol-
                 lary 4.5,

                                          PX + PX > PP

                 and hence the result: P X > P Q.

5.11. Exercise. Assume ABC is right or obtuse. Show that

5.12. Exercise. Suppose that ABC has a right angle at C. Show that
for any X  [AC] the distance from X to (AB) is smaller than AB.

Circles

Recall that a circle with radius r and center O is the set of all points
on distance r from O. We say that a point P lies inside of the circle if
OP < r; if OP > r, we say that P lies outside of the circle.

5.13. Exercise. Let  be a circle and P / . Assume a line  is passing
thru the point P and intersects  at two distinct points, X and Y . Show
that P is inside  if and only if P lies between X and Y .

    A segment between two points on a circle is called a chord of the circle.
A chord passing thru the center of the circle is called its diameter.

5.14. Exercise. Assume two distinct circles  and  have a common
chord [AB]. Show that the line between centers of  and  forms a
perpendicular bisector to [AB].

5.15. Lemma.   A line and a circle can have at most two points of
intersection.

Proof. Assume A, B, and C are dis-        m
                                                         n
tinct points that lie on a line  and
a circle  with the center O. Then A B                            
OA = OB = OC; in particular, O                              C

lies on the perpendicular bisectors

m and n to [AB] and [BC] respec-

tively. Note that the midpoints of [AB] and [BC] are distinct. Therefore,

m and n are distinct. The latter contradicts the uniqueness of the per-

pendicular (Theorem 5.5).

5.16. Exercise. Show that two distinct circles can have at most two
points of intersection.

    In consequence of the above lemma, a line  and a circle  might have
2, 1, or 0 points of intersections. In the first two cases, the line is called
secant or tangent respectively; if P is the only point of intersection of 
and , we say that  is tangent to  at P .

    Similarly, according to Exercise 5.16, two distinct circles might have
2, 1 or 0 points of intersections. If P is the only point of intersection of
circles  and , we say that  is tangent to  at P ; we also assume that
circle is tangent to itself at any of its points.

5.17. Lemma. Let  be a line and  be a circle with the center O.
Assume P is a common point of  and . Then  is tangent to  at P if
and only if (P O)  .

Proof. Let Q be the foot point of O on .
40  CHAPTER 5. PERPENDICULAR LINES

    Assume P = Q. Let P  be the reflection of P across (OQ). Note
that P    and (OQ) is the perpendicular bisector of [P P ]. Therefore,
OP = OP . Hence P, P     ; that is,  is secant to .

    If P = Q, then according to Lemma 5.10, OP < OX for any point
X   distinct from P . Hence P is the only point in the intersection   ;
that is,  is tangent to  at P .

5.18. Exercise. Let  and  be two distinct circles with centers at O
and O respectively. Assume  meets  at a point P . Show that  is
tangent to  if and only if O, O, and P lie on one line.

5.19. Exercise. Let  and  be two distinct circles with centers at O
and O and radiuses r and r. Show that  is tangent to  if and only if

                         OO = r + r or OO = |r - r|.

5.20. Exercise. Assume three circles have two points in
common. Prove that their centers lie on one line.

Geometric constructions

A ruler-and-compass construction in the plane is a construction of points,
lines, and circles using only an idealized ruler and compass. These con-
struction problems provide a valuable source of exercises in geometry,
which we will use further in the book. In addition, Chapter 19 is devoted
completely to the subject.

    The idealized ruler can be used only to draw a line thru the given two
points. The idealized compass can be used only to draw a circle with a
given center and radius. That is, given three points A, B, and O we can
draw the set of all points on distance AB from O. We may also mark new
points in the plane, as well as on the constructed lines, circles, and their
intersections (assuming that such points exist).

    We can also look at the different sets of construction tools. For exam-
ple, we may only use the ruler or we may invent a new tool, say a tool
that produces a midpoint for any given two points.

    As an example, let us consider the following problem:

5.21. Construction of midpoint. Construct the midpoint of the given
segment [AB].

Construction.
   1. Construct the circle with center A that is passing thru B. Construct
       the circle with center B that is passing thru A. Mark both points
       of intersection of these circles, label them with P and Q.
                                                     41

2. Draw the line (P Q). Mark the point M of intersection of (P Q) and
   [AB]; this is the midpoint.

             B  P                PPPP
A                            B                 B

                A                         M
                              Q  A

                                               QQQQ

    Typically, you need to prove that the construction produces what was
expected. Here is a proof for the example above.

Proof. According to Theorem 5.2, (P Q) is the perpendicular bisector
to [AB]. Therefore, M = (AB)  (P Q) is the midpoint of [AB].

5.22. Exercise. Make a ruler-and-compass construction of a line thru
a given point that is perpendicular to a given line.

5.23. Exercise. Make a ruler-and-compass construction of the center of
a given circle.

5.24. Exercise. Make a ruler-and-compass construction of the lines tan-
gent to a given circle that pass thru a given point.

5.25. Exercise. Given two circles 1 and 2 and a segment [AB] make
a ruler-and-compass construction of a circle with the radius AB that is

tangent to each circle 1 and 2.

Similar triangles

Similar triangles

Two triangles ABC and ABC are called similar (briefly ABC 
 ABC) if (1) their sides are proportional; that is,

  AB = k·AB, BC = k·BC and CA = k·CA

for some k > 0, and (2) the corresponding angles are equal up to sign:

  ABC = ±ABC,

  BCA = ±BCA,

  CAB = ±CAB.

Remarks.
     According to 3.7, in the above three equalities, the signs can be
       assumed to be the same.
     If ABC  ABC with k = 1 in , then ABC = ABC.
     Note that "" is an equivalence relation. That is,
         (i) ABC  ABC for any ABC.
        (ii) If ABC  ABC, then

                                         ABC  ABC.

       (iii) If ABC  ABC and ABC  ABC, then

                                        ABC  ABC.

                                              42
                                                                                             43

    Using the new notation "", we can reformulate Axiom V:

6.1. Reformulation of Axiom V. If for the two triangles ABC,
ABC, and k > 0 we have B  [AB), C  [AC), AB = k·AB and
AC = k·AC, then ABC  ABC.

    In other words, the Axiom V provides a condition which guarantees
that two triangles are similar. Let us formulate three more such similarity
conditions.
6.2. Similarity conditions. Two triangles ABC and ABC are
similar if one of the following conditions holds:

    (SAS) For some constant k > 0 we have

                            AB = k·AB, AC = k·AC

                              and BAC = ±BAC.

    (AA) The triangle ABC is nondegenerate and

                 ABC = ±ABC, BAC = ±BAC.

    (SSS) For some constant k > 0 we have

                AB = k·AB, AC = k·AC, CB = k·CB.

    Each of these conditions is proved by applying Axiom V with the SAS,
ASA, and SSS congruence conditions respectively (see Axiom IV and the
conditions 4.1, 4.4).
Proof. Set k = AB AB . Choose points B  [AB) and C  [AC), so
that AB = k·AB and AC = k·AC. By Axiom V, ABC 
 ABC.

    Applying the SAS, ASA or SSS congruence condition, depending on
the case, we get that ABC = ABC. Hence the result.

    A bijection X  X from a plane to itself is called angle preserving
transformation if

                                   ABC = ABC

for any triangle ABC and its image ABC.

6.3. Exercise. Show that any angle-preserving transformation of the
plane multiplies all the distance by a fixed constant.

Pythagorean theorem

A triangle is called right if one of its angles is right. The side opposite
the right angle is called the hypotenuse. The sides adjacent to the right
angle are called legs.

6.4. Theorem. Assume ABC is a right triangle with the right angle
at C. Then

                                  AC2 + BC2 = AB2.

Proof. Let D be the foot point of C on (AB).

    According to Lemma 5.10,                       C

                AD < AC < AB

and                                           A    D        B
                 BD < BC < AB.

Therefore, D lies between A and B; in particular,

                AD + BD = AB.

    Note that by the AA similarity condition, we have

                ADC  ACB  CDB.

In particular,

 AD = AC and BD = BC .
                AC AB           BC BA

    Let us rewrite the two identities in :

                AC2 = AB·AD and BC2 = AB·BD.

Summing up these two identities and applying , we get that

                AC2 + BC2 = AB ·(AD + BD) = AB2.

    The idea in the proof above appears in the Elements [8, X.33], but
the proof given there [8, I.47] is different; it uses area method discussed
in Chapter 20.

6.5. Exercise. Assume A, B, C, and D are as in the proof above. Show

that
                                     CD2 = AD·BD.

    The following exercise is the converse to the Pythagorean theorem.
6.6. Exercise. Assume that ABC is a triangle such that

                                  AC2 + BC2 = AB2.
Prove that the angle at C is right.

Method of similar triangles

The proof of the Pythagorean theorem given above uses the method of
similar triangles. To apply this method, one has to search for pairs of
similar triangles and then use the proportionality of corresponding sides
and/or equalities of corresponding angles. Finding such pairs might be
tricky at first.

6.7. Exercise. Let ABC be a nondegenerate triangle A         B

and the points X, Y , and Z as on the diagram. Assume  Z

CAY  XBC. Find four pairs of similar triangles X

with these six points as the vertices and prove their     Y

similarity.                                            C

Ptolemy's inequality

A quadrangle is defined as an ordered quadruple of distinct points in the
plane. These 4 points are called vertices. The quadrangle ABCD will be
also denoted by ABCD.

    Given a quadrangle ABCD, the four segments [AB], [BC], [CD], and
[DA] are called sides of ABCD; the remaining two segments [AC] and
[BD] are called diagonals of ABCD.

6.8. Ptolemy's inequality. In any quadrangle, the product of diagonals
cannot exceed the sum of the products of its opposite sides; that is,

                       AC ·BD AB·CD + BC ·DA

for any ABCD.

    We will present a classical proof of this inequality using the method
of similar triangles with an additional construction. This proof is given
as an illustration it will not be used further in the sequel.

Proof. Consider the half-line [AX) such that

BAX = CAD. In this case, XAD = BAC A                         D

since adding BAX or CAD to the correspond-

ing sides produces BAD. We can assume that

             AX = AB ·AD.                              X
                      AC
                                              B              C

In this case, we have

             AX = AB ,       AX = AD .
             AD AC           AB AC
46                            CHAPTER 6. SIMILAR TRIANGLES

Hence

       BAX  CAD,                    XAD  BAC.

Therefore                           XD = AD ,
                   BX = AB ,        BC AC
                   CD AC

or, equivalently

       AC ·BX = AB·CD,              AC ·XD = BC ·AD.

Adding these two equalities we get

       AC ·(BX + XD) = AB·CD + BC ·AD.

It remains to apply the triangle inequality, BD BX + XD.

    Using the proof above together with Corollary 9.13, one can show that
the equality holds only if the vertices A, B, C, and D appear on a line or
a circle in the same cyclic order; see also 10.12 for another proof of the
equality case. Exercise 18.2 below suggests another proof of Ptolemy's
inequality using complex coordinates.

Parallel lines

Parallel lines

In consequence of Axiom II, any two distinct lines  and m
have either one point in common or none. In the first case
they are intersecting (briefly   m); in the second case, 
and m are said to be parallel (briefly,  m); in addition,
a line is always regarded as parallel to itself.

    To emphasize that two lines on a diagram are parallel we will mark
them with arrows of the same type.
7.1. Proposition. Let , m, and n be three lines. Assume that n  m
and m  . Then  n.

Proof. Assume the contrary; that is,   n. Then there is a point, say Z,
of intersection of  and n. Then by Theorem 5.5,  = n. Since any line is
parallel to itself, we have that  n a contradiction.

7.2. Theorem. For any point P and any line , there is a unique line
m that passes thru P and is parallel to .

    The above theorem has two parts, existence and uniqueness. In the
proof of uniqueness, we will use the method of similar triangles.
Proof; existence. Apply Theorem 5.5 two times, first to construct the line
n thru P that is perpendicular to , and second to construct the line n
thru P that is perpendicular to m. Then apply Proposition 7.1.
Uniqueness. If P  , then m =  by the definition of parallel lines.
Further we assume P / .

    Let us construct the lines n  P and m  P as in the proof of existence,
so m .

7.3. Corollary. Assume , m, and n are lines such that   m and
m n. Then  n.

Proof. Assume the contrary; that is,   n. Then there is a point P  n.
By Theorem 7.2, n =  a contradiction.

Therefore, according to the above corollary, " " is an equivalence relation.

  (i)  ;
  (ii) if  m, then m ;
 (iii) if  m and m n, then  n.

Reflection across a point

Fix a point O. If O is the midpoint of a line segment [XX], then we say
that X is a reflection of X across the point O.

    Note that the map X  X is uniquely defined; it is called a reflection
across O. In this case, O is called the center of reflection. We assume that
O = O; that is, O is a reflection of itself across itself. If the reflection
across O moves a set S to itself, then we say that S is centrally symmetric
with respect to O.

    Recall that any motion is either direct or indirect; that is, it either
preserves or reverts the signs of angles (see page 37).

7.6. Proposition. Any reflection across a point is a direct motion.

Proof. Observe that if X is a reflection of X across O, then X is a

reflection of X. In other words, the composition of the reflection with

itself is the identity map. In particular, any reflection across a point is a

bijection.

Fix two points X and Y ; let X and Y  be

their reflections across O. To check that the re-               X
flection is distance preserving, we need to show Y

that XY  = XY . O
    We may assume that X, Y , and O are distinct;

otherwise, the statement is trivial. By definition

of reflection across O, we have that OX = OX,                   Y

OY = OY , and the angles XOY and XOY  are X

vertical; in particular, XOY = XOY . By
SAS, XOY = XOY ; therefore XY  = XY .

Finally, the reflection across O cannot be indirect since XOY =

= XOY ; therefore it is a direct motion.

7.7. Exercise. Suppose AOB is right. Show that the composition of
reflections across the lines (OA) and (OB) is a reflection across O.

    Use this statement and Corollary 5.7 to build another proof of Propo-
sition 7.6.

7.8. Theorem. Let  be a line, Q  , and P is an ar-        P     m
bitrary point. Suppose O is the midpoint of [P Q]. Then
a line m passing thru P is parallel to  if and only if m     O
is a reflection of  across O.

Proof; "if " part. Assume m is a reflection of  across O. Suppose   m;
that is  and m intersect at a single point Z. Denote by Z be the reflection

of Z across O.

    Note that Z lies on both lines  and m. It follows that Z = Z or
equivalently Z = O. In this case, O   and therefore the reflection
of  across O is  itself; that is,  = m and in particular  m a
contradiction.

"Only-if " part. Let  be the reflection of  across O. According to the
"if" part of the theorem,  . Note that both lines  and m pass thru
P . By uniqueness of parallel lines (7.2), if m , then  = m; whence
the statement follows.

Transversal property

If the line t intersects each line  and m at one point,         A
then we say that t is a transversal to  and m. For         B
example, on the diagram, line (CB) is a transversal to
(AB) and (CD).                                                       C

7.9. Transversal property. (AB) (CD) if and only if

                   2·(ABC + BCD)  0.

Equivalently

           ABC + BCD  0 or ABC + BCD  .

Moreover, if (AB) = (CD), then in the first case, A and D lie on opposite
sides of (BC); in the second case, A and D lie on the same sides of (BC).

Proof; "only-if " part. Denote by O the midpoint of [BC].

  Assume (AB) (CD). According to Theorem 7.8, (CD) is a reflection

of (AB) across O.

  Let A be the reflection of A across O. Then              B            A

A  (CD) and by Proposition 7.6 we have that O

               ABO = ACO.

                                               A              CD

Note that

               ABO  ABC, ACO  -BCA.

Since A, C and D lie on one line, Exercise 2.11 implies that

                2·BCD  2·BCA.

Finally note that , , and  imply .

"If "-part. By Theorem 7.2 there is a unique line (CD) thru C that is
parallel to (AB). From the "only-if" part we know that  holds.

    On the other hand, there is a unique line (CD) such that  holds.
Indeed, suppose there are two such lines (CD) and (CD), then

              2·(ABC + BCD)  2·(ABC + BCD)  0.

Therefore 2·BCD  2·BCD and by Exercise 2.11, D  (CD), or
equivalently the line (CD) coincides with (CD).

    Therefore if  holds, then (CD) (AB).

    Finally, if (AB) = (CD) and A and D lie on the opposite sides of
(BC), then ABC and BCD have opposite signs. Therefore

                             - < ABC + BCD < .

Applying , we get ABC + BCD = 0.
    Similarly, if A and D lie on the same side of (BC), then ABC and

BCD have the same sign. Therefore

                            0 < |ABC + BCD| < 2·

and  implies that ABC + BCD  .

7.10. Exercise. Let ABC be a nondegenerate triangle, and P lies
between A and B. Suppose that a line  passes thru P and is parallel to
(AC). Show that  crosses the side [BC] at another point, say Q, and

In particular,  P B = QB .

7.12. Theorem. In any ABC, we have
                           ABC + BCA + CAB  .

Proof. First note that if ABC is degenerate, then the equality follows
from Corollary 2.9. Further we assume that ABC is nondegenerate.

    B     X      Let X be the reflection of C across the midpoint M
             of [AB]. By Proposition 7.6 BAX = ABC. Note
       M     that (AX) is a reflection of (CB) across M ; therefore
             by Theorem 7.8, (AX) (CB).
C      A
                 Since [BM ] and [M X] do not intersect (CA), the

             plying the transversal property for the transversal (CA)
             to (AX) and (CB), we get that

             BCA + CAX  .

    Since BAX = ABC, we have

The latter identity and  imply the theorem.

Parallelograms                                           B        C

A quadrangle ABCD in the Euclidean plane is called

nondegenerate if no three points from A, B, C, D lie     A     D

on one line.

A nondegenerate quadrangle is called a parallelogram if its opposite

sides are parallel.

7.18. Lemma. Any parallelogram is centrally symmetric with respect to
a midpoint of one of its diagonals.

    In particular, if ABCD is a parallelogram, then
  (a) its diagonals [AC] and [BD] intersect each other at their midpoints;
  (b) ABC = CDA;
  (c) AB = CD.

Proof. Let ABCD be a parallelogram. Denote

by M the midpoint of [AC].                            B           C

Since (AB) (CD), Theorem 7.8 implies that                   M

(CD) is a reflection of (AB) across M . In the

same way, (BC) is a reflection of (DA) across M .

Since ABCD is nondegenerate, it follows that

D is a reflection of B across M ; in other words, A            D

M is the midpoint of [BD].

The remaining statements follow since reflection across M is a direct

motion of the plane (see 7.6).

7.19. Exercise. Assume ABCD is a quadrangle such that

                                AB = CD = BC = DA.

Show that ABCD is a parallelogram.

    A quadrangle as in the exercise above is called a rhombus.
    A quadrangle ABCD is called a rectangle if the angles ABC, BCD,
CDA, and DAB are right. Note that according to the transversal prop-
erty (7.9), any rectangle is a parallelogram.
    A rectangle with equal sides is called a square.

7.20. Exercise. Show that the parallelogram ABCD is a rectangle if
and only if AC = BD.

7.21. Exercise. Show that the parallelogram ABCD is a rhombus if and
only if (AC)  (BD).

    Assume  m, and X, Y  m. Let X and Y  denote the foot points
of X and Y on . Note that XY Y X is a rectangle. By Lemma 7.18,
XX = Y Y . That is, any point on m lies at the same distance from .
This distance is called the distance between  and m.

Method of coordinates

The following exercise is important; it shows that our axiomatic definition
agrees with the model definition described on page 11.

7.22. Exercise. Let  and m be perpendicular lines in the Euclidean
plane. Given a point P , let P and Pm denote the foot points of P on

Chapter 8

Triangle geometry

Triangle geometry is the study of the properties of triangles, including
associated centers and circles.

    We discuss the most basic results in triangle geometry, mostly to show
that we have developed sufficient machinery to prove things.

Circumcircle and circumcenter

8.1. Theorem. Perpendicular bisectors to the sides of any nondegener-
ate triangle intersect at one point.

    The point of intersection of the perpendicular bisectors is called cir-
cumcenter. It is the center of the circumcircle of the triangle; that is, a
circle that passes thru all three vertices of the triangle. The circumcenter
of the triangle is usually denoted by O.

              Proof. Let ABC be nondegenerate. Let  and m

     A        be perpendicular bisectors to sides [AB] and [AC]

              respectively.

        m     Assume  and m intersect, let O =   m.

              Let us apply Theorem 5.2. Since O  , we have

     O that OA = OB and since O  m, we have that OA =
                    = OC. It follows that OB = OC; that is, O lies on

B          C  the perpendicular bisector to [BC].

              It remains to show that   m; assume the con-

              trary. Since   (AB) and m  (AC), we get

that (AC) (AB) (see Exercise 7.4). Therefore, by Theorem 5.5,

(AC) = (AB); that is, ABC is degenerate a contradiction.

                                                                                             57

8.2. Exercise. There is a unique circle that passes thru the vertices of
a given nondegenerate triangle in the Euclidean plane.

Altitudes and orthocenter

An altitude of a triangle is a line thru a vertex and perpendicular to the
line containing the opposite side. The term altitude may also be used for
the distance from the vertex to its foot point on the line containing the
opposite side.

8.3. Theorem. The three altitudes of any nondegenerate triangle inter-
sect in a single point.

    The point of intersection of altitudes is called orthocenter ; it is usually
denoted by H.

Proof. Fix a nondegenerate triangle ABC. Con-  m        
sider three lines , m, and n such that
                                               n A C
 (BC),  m (CA),                    n (AB),                           B
  A,    m  B,                      n  C.
                                               B     A

Since ABC is nondegenerate, no pair of the        C

lines , m, and n is parallel. Set

A = m  n, B = n  , C =   m.

    Note that ABAC, BCBA, and CBCA are parallelograms. Ap-
plying Lemma 7.18 we get that ABC is the median triangle of ABC;
that is, A, B, and C are the midpoints of [BC], [CA], and [AB] re-

spectively.
    By Exercise 7.4, (BC) (BC), the altitude from A is perpendicular

to [BC] and from above it bisects [BC].

    Hence the altitudes of ABC are also perpendicular bisectors of
ABC. Applying Theorem 8.1, we get that altitudes of ABC in-

tersect at one point.

8.4. Exercise. Assume H is the orthocenter of an acute triangle ABC.
Show that A is the orthocenter of HBC.

Medians and centroid

A median of a triangle is the segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of
the opposing side.
58                              CHAPTER 8. TRIANGLE GEOMETRY

8.5. Theorem. The three medians of any nondegenerate triangle inter-
sect in a single point. Moreover, the point of intersection divides each
median in the ratio 2:1.

    The point of intersection of medians is called the centroid of the tri-
angle; it is usually denoted by M . In the proof, we will apply exercises
3.14 and 7.10; their complete solutions are given in the hits.

Proof. Consider a nondegenerate triangle ABC. Let [AA] and [BB] be

its medians. According to Exercise 3.14, [AA] and [BB] have a point of

intersection; denote it by M .

    B  Draw a line  thru A parallel to (BB). Ap-

       plying Exercise 7.10 for BBC and , we get

                that  cross [BC] at some point X and
       A

    M CX = CA = 1 ;
                                            CB CB 2

A B X C that is, X is the midpoint of [CB].

                                    Since B is the midpoint of [AC] and X is the
midpoint of [BC], we get that

                                         AB = 2 .
                                         AX 3
    Applying Exercise 7.10 for XAA and the line (BB), we get that

       AM AB 2
                                =  =;
       AA AX 3

that is, M divides [AA] in the ratio 2:1.
    Note that  uniquely defines M on [AA]. Repeating the same argu-

ment for medians [AA] and [CC], we get that they intersect at M as

well, hence the result.

8.6. Exercise. Let ABCD be a nondegenerate quadrangle and X, Y ,
V , W be the midpoints of its sides [AB], [BC], [CD], and [DA]. Show
that XY V W is a parallelogram.

Angle bisectors

If ABX  -CBX, then we say that the line (BX) bisects ABC, or
the line (BX) is  bisector of ABC. If ABX   - CBX, then the
line (BX) is called the external bisector of ABC.
                                                                           59

    If ABA = ; that is, if B lies between                                C ctor
A and A, then the bisector of ABC is the             rnal
external bisector of ABC and the other            exte tor   bise
                                                bisec
way around.                                     B
                                                                   A
    Note that the bisector and the external

bisector are uniquely defined by the angle.

8.7. Exercise. Show that for any angle,
its bisector and external bisector are perpen-
dicular.

    The bisectors of ABC, BCA, and CAB of a nondegenerate tri-
angle ABC are called bisectors of the triangle ABC at vertices A, B, and
C respectively.

8.8. Lemma. Let ABC be a nondegenerate triangle. Assume that the
bisector at the vertex A intersects the side [BC] at the point D. Then

 AB = DB .
                                        AC DC

Proof. Let  be a line passing thru C that is parallel        A

to (AB). Note that   (AD); set

        E =   (AD).                                    C DB

  Note also that B and C lie on opposite sides

of (AD). Therefore, by the transversal property           E

(7.9),

        BAD = CED.

  Further, the angles ADB and EDC are vertical; in particular, by 2.13

        ADB = EDC.

    By the AA similarity condition, ABD  ECD. In particular,

 AB = DB .
                                        EC DC

    Since (AD) bisects BAC, we get that BAD = DAC. Together
with , it implies that CEA = EAC. By Theorem 4.2, ACE is
isosceles; that is,

                                         EC = AC.

Together with , it implies .

8.9. Exercise. Formulate and prove an analog of Lemma 8.8 for the
external bisector.

Equidistant property

Recall that distance from a line  to a point P is defined as the distance
from P to its foot point on ; see page 38.

8.10. Proposition. Assume ABC is not degenerate. Then a point
X lies on the bisector or external bisector of ABC if and only if X is
equidistant from the lines (AB) and (BC).

Proof. We can assume that X does not lie on the union of (AB) and
(BC). Otherwise, the distance to one of the lines vanish; in this case,
X = B is the only point equidistant from the two lines.

    Let Y and Z be the reflections of X across (AB) and (BC) respectively.
Note that

                                           Y = Z.

Otherwise, both lines (AB) and (BC) are perpendicular bisectors of [XY ],

that is, (AB) = (BC) which is impossible since ABC is not degenerate.

                       By Proposition 5.6,

    ZC                          XB = Y B = ZB.

         X Note that X is equidistant from (AB) and (BC) if
         and only if XY = XZ. Applying SSS and then SAS,
B

         we get that

      A                         XY = XZ.

                                            BXY = BXZ.
    Y

                                              XBY  ±BXZ.
    Since Y = Z, we get that XBY = BXZ; therefore

                       XBY = -BXZ.

    By Proposition 5.6, A lies on the bisector of XBY and B lies on the
bisector of XBZ; that is,

      2·XBA  XBY,                           2·XBC  XBZ.

By ,

                       2·XBA  -2·XBC.

The last identity means either

      XBA + XBC  0 or XBA + XBC  ,

and hence the result.

Incenter

8.11. Theorem. The angle bisectors of any nondegenerate triangle
intersect at one point.

    The point of intersection of bisectors is called the incenter of the
triangle; it is usually denoted by I. The point I lie at the same distance
from each side. In particular, it is the center of a circle tangent to each
side of the triangle. This circle is called the incircle and its radius is called
the inradius of the triangle.

Proof. Let ABC be a nondegenerate triangle.              C
    Note that the points B and C lie on opposite
                                                                A
sides of the bisector of BAC. Hence this bisector        IIII X
intersects [BC] at a point, say A.
                                                         Z  B
    Analogously, there is B  [AC] such that (BB)
bisects ABC.

    Applying Pasch's theorem (3.12) twice for the tri-
angles AAC and BBC, we get that [AA] and [BB] B
intersect. Suppose that I denotes the point of inter- Y
section.

    Let X, Y , and Z be the foot points of I on (BC),
(CA), and (AB) respectively. Applying Proposi- A
tion 8.10, we get that

                                     IY = IZ = IX.

From the same lemma, we get that I lies on the bisector or on the exterior

bisector of BCA.
    The line (CI) intersects [BB], the points B and B lie on opposite

sides of (CI). Therefore, the angles ICB and ICB have opposite signs.
Note that ICA = ICB. Therefore, (CI) cannot be the exterior bi-

sector of BCA. Hence the result.

XAA and XBB are right. Show that (XP )  (AB).

Solution. Set Y = (AB)  (XP ).
    Both angles XAA and XBB are right; therefore

                     2·XAA  2·XBB.

By Corollary 9.13, XAP B is inscribed. Applying this theorem again
we get that

By the same theorem  XAY A is inscribed, and
therefore,           2·XAA  2·XY A.

Since XAA is right, so is XY A. That is (XP )  (AB).

Arcs of circlines

A subset of a circle bounded by two points is called a circle arc.
    More precisely, suppose A, B, C are distinct points on a circle . The

circle arc ABC is the subset that includes the points A, C, as well as all
the points on  that lie with B on the same side of (AC).

    Points A and C are called endpoints of the circle arc ABC. There are
precisely two circle arcs of  with the given endpoints; they are opposite
to each other.

    Suppose X be another point on . By Corollary 9.13 we have that
2·AXC  2·ABC; that is,

             AXC  ABC or AXC  ABC + .

    Recall that X and B lie on the same side from

(AC) if and only if AXC and ABC have the

same sign (see Exercise 3.13). It follows that     C

     X lies on the arc ABC if and only if                                   X

             AXC  ABC;

     X lies on the arc opposite to ABC if                                A
                     AXC  ABC + .                      B

                                                              X

    Note that a circle arc ABC is defined if ABC is not degenerate. If

ABC is degenerate, then arc ABC is defined as a subset of line bounded

by A and C that contains B.

    More precisely, if B lies between A and

C, then the arc ABC is defined as the line            AB C

segment [AC]. If B lies on the extension

of [AC], then the arc ABC is defined as a X B A C Y

union of disjoint half-lines [AX) and [CY )

in (AC). In this case, the arcs ABC and ABC are called opposite to

each other.

    In addition, any half-line [AB) will be

regarded as an arc. If A lies between B X             A       B

and X, then [AX) will be called opposite

to [AB). This degenerate arc has only one endpoint A.

    It will be convenient to use the notion of circline, which means circle

or line. For example, any arc is a subset of a circline; we also may

use the term circline arc if we want to emphasize that the arc might be

degenerate. Note that for any three distinct points A, B, and C there is

a unique circline arc ABC.

    The following statement summarizes the discussion above.
                                                                                             69

9.19. Proposition. Let ABC be a circline arc and X be a point distinct
from A and C. Then

  (a) X lies on the arc ABC if and only if
                                        AXC = ABC;

  (b) X lies on the arc opposite to ABC if and only if
                                     AXC  ABC + ;

9.20. Exercise. Given an acute triangle ABC make a compass-and-
ruler construction of the point Z such that

                        AZB = BZC = CZA = ± 23 ·

9.21. Exercise. Suppose that point P lies on the circumcircle of an
equilateral triangle ABC and P A P B P C. Show that P A + P B =
= PC.

    A quadrangle ABCD is inscribed if all the points A, B, C, and D lie
on a circline . If the arcs ABC and ADC are opposite, then we say that
the points A, B, C, and D appear on  in the same cyclic order.

    This definition makes it possible to formulate the following refinement
of Corollary 9.13 which includes the degenerate quadrangles. It follows
directly from 9.19.

9.22. Proposition. A quadrangle ABCD is inscribed in a circline if
and only if

                 ABC = ADC or ABC  ADC + .

Moreover, the second identity holds if and only if the points A, B, C, D
appear on the circline in the same cyclic order.

Tangent half-lines

Suppose ABC is an arc of a circle . A half-line      A
[AX) is called tangent to the arc ABC at A if the                X

line (AX) is tangent to , and the points X and B   

lie on the same side of the line (AC).                 B

If the arc is formed by the line segment [AC],

then the half-line [AC) is considered to be tangent C
70  CHAPTER 9. INSCRIBED ANGLES

at A. If the arc is formed by a union of two half-
lines [AX) and [BY ) in (AC), then the half-line [AX) is considered to be
tangent to the arc at A.

9.23. Proposition. The half-line [AX) is tangent to the arc ABC if
and only if

                                 ABC + CAX  .

Proof. For a degenerate arc ABC, the statement is evident. Further we
assume the arc ABC is nondegenerate.

    Note that the tangent half-line to the arc ABC at A is uniquely de-
fined. Further, there is a unique half-line [AX) such that the equation
in the proposition holds. Therefore it is sufficient to prove the "only-if"
part.

                            If [AX) is tangent to the arc ABC, then by 9.1 and
       A X 9.2, we get that

C Therefore, either

              ABC + CAX  , or ABC + CAX  0.

    By the definition of tangent half-line, X and B lie on the same side
of (AC). By 3.10 and 3.7, the angles CAX, CAB, and ABC have the
same sign. In particular, ABC + CAX  0; that is, we are left with
the case

Inversion

Let  be the circle with center O and radius r. The inversion of a point
P in  is the point P   [OP ) such that

                                      OP ·OP  = r2.

In this case, the circle  will be called the circle of inversion and its

center O is called the center of inversion.

The inverse of O is undefined.

Note that if P is inside , then P  is outside and the other way around.

Further, P = P  if and only if P  .                         T

Note that the inversion maps P  back to P .

10.1. Exercise. Let  be a circle centered        O P           P

at O. Suppose that a line (P T ) is tangent to   
at T . Let P  be the foot point of T on (OP ).

    Show that P  is the inverse of P in .

10.2. Lemma. Let  be a circle with the center O. Assume A and B
are the inverses of A and B in . Then

                                   OAB  OBA.

Moreover,   AOB  -BOA,
            OBA  -OAB,

Proof. Let r be the radius of the circle of the inversion.

                             From SAS, we get that

                               OAB  OBA.

    Applying Theorem 3.7 and , we get .

10.3. Exercise. Let P  be the inverse of P in the circle . Assume that

P   = P .  Show  that   the  value   PX   is  the  same  for  all  X   .
                                     P X

    The converse to the exercise above also holds. Namely, given a positive

real number k = 1 and two distinct points P and P  the locus of points

X   such  that  PX   =  k  forms  a  circle   which  is  called  the  Apollonian  circle.
                P X
In this case, P  is inverse of P in the Apollonian circle.

10.4. Exercise. Let A, B, and C be the images of A, B, and C under

the inversion in the incircle of ABC. Show that the incenter of ABC

of a given point in a given circle.

Cross-ratio

The following theorem gives some quantities expressed in distances or
angles that do not change after inversion.

10.6. Theorem. Let ABCD and ABCD be two quadrangles such
that the points A, B, C, and D are the inverses of A, B, C, and D
respectively.

    Then
  (a)

                                    AB ·CD AB ·CD
                                    BC ·DA = BC ·DA .

                                                                                           73
(c) If the quadrangle ABCD is inscribed, then so is ABCD.

Proof; (a). Let O be the center of the inversion. According to Lemma 10.2,
AOB  BOA. Therefore,

                                        AB OA
                                       AB = OB .

Analogously,

BC OC               CD OC      DA OA
BC = OB ,           CD = OD ,  DA = OD .

Therefore,

AB BC CD DA OA OB OC OD
              ·     ·  ·       = · · · .
AB BC C D DA OB OC OD OA

Hence (a) follows.

(b). According to Lemma 10.2,

                  ABO  -BAO, OBC  -OCB,
  CDO  -DCO, ODA  -OAD.

By Axiom IIIb,                 DCB  DCO + OCB,
                               BAD  BAO + OAD.
     ABC  ABO + OBC,
     CDA  CDO + ODA,

Therefore, summing the four identities in , we get that
                   ABC + CDA  -(DCB + BAD).

Applying Axiom IIIb and Exercise 7.17, we get that

              ABC + CDA  -(BCD + DAB) 
                                           DCB + BAD.

Hence (b) follows.
(c). Follows by (b) and Corollary 9.13.
74  CHAPTER 10. INVERSION

Inversive plane and circlines

Let  be a circle with the center O and the radius r. Consider the
inversion in .

    Recall that the inverse of O is undefined. To deal with this problem
it is useful to add to the plane an extra point; it will be called the point
at infinity; we will denote it as . We can assume that  is inverse of
O and the other way around.

    The Euclidean plane with an added point at infinity is called the in-
versive plane.

    We will always assume that any line and half-line contains .
    Recall that circline means circle or line. Therefore we may say "if a
circline contains , then it is a line" or "a circline that does not contain
 is a circle".
    Note that according to Theorem 8.1, for any ABC there is a unique
circline that passes thru A, B, and C (if ABC is degenerate, then this
is a line and if not it is a circle).

10.7. Theorem. In the inversive plane, inverse of a circline is a cir-
cline.

Proof. Suppose that O denotes the center of the inversion and r its radius.

    Let  be a circline. Choose three distinct points A, B, and C on .
(If ABC is nondegenerate, then  is the circumcircle of ABC; if
ABC is degenerate, then  is the line passing thru A, B, and C.)

    Let A, B, and C denote the inverses of A, B, and C respectively.
Let  be the circline that passes thru A, B, and C.

    Assume D is a point of the inversive plane that is distinct from A, C,
O, and . Suppose that D denotes the inverse of D.

    By Theorem 10.6c, D   if and only if D  .
    It remains to prove that O       and     O  . We
will prove that

                                   = O  ;

the remaining implications can be proved along the same lines.
    If   , then  is a line; or, equivalently, for any  > 0, the circline

 contains a point P such that OP > r/. For the inversion P    of
P , we have that OP  = r2/OP < r·. That is, the circline  contains
points arbitrarily close to O. It follows that O  .

10.8. Exercise. Assume that the circle  is the inverse of the circle .
Suppose that Q denotes the center of  and Q denotes the inverse of Q.
Show that Q is not the center of .
                                                                    75

    Assume that a circumtool is a geometric                     
construction tool that produces a circline pass-           Q
ing thru any three given points.

10.9. Exercise. Show that with only a cir-         QQQQ
cumtool, it is impossible to construct the center

of a given circle.

10.10. Exercise. Show that for any pair of
tangent circles in the inversive plane, there is
an inversion that sends them to a pair of parallel lines.

10.11. Theorem. Consider the inversion of the inversive plane in the
circle  with the center O. Then

  (a) A line passing thru O is inverted into itself.
  (b) A line not passing thru O is inverted into a circle that passes thru

       O, and the other way around.
  (c) A circle not passing thru O is inverted into a circle not passing

       thru O.

Proof. In the proof, we use Theorem 10.7 without mentioning it.

(a). Note that if a line passes thru O, it contains both  and O. There-
fore, its inverse also contains  and O. In particular, the image is a line
passing thru O.

(b). Since any line  passes thru , its image  has to contain O. If the
line does not contain O, then   ; that is,  is not a line. Therefore,
 is a circle that passes thru O.

(c). If the circle  does not contain O, then its image  does not con-
tain . Therefore,  is a circle. Since    we get that   O. Hence
the result.

Method of inversion

Here is an application of inversion, which we include as an illustration;
we will not use it further in the book.
10.12. Ptolemy's identity. Let ABCD be an inscribed quadrangle.
Assume that the points A, B, C, and D appear on the circline in the
same order. Then

                           AB·CD + BC ·DA = AC ·BD.

Proof. Assume the points A, B, C, D lie on one line in this order.
76                                   CHAPTER 10. INVERSION

A xxxx B yyyy C zzzz D        Set x = AB, y = BC, z = CD. Note that
                              x·z + y·(x + y + z) = (x + y)·(y + z).

Since AC = x + y, BD = y + z, and DA = x + y + z, it proves the identity.

                              It remains to consider the case when the

A B C D quadrangle ABCD is inscribed in a circle,

                              say .

          BBBB  CCCC          The identity can be rewritten as
                                       AB·DC + BC ·AD = 1.

    AAAA

                              On the left-hand side we have two cross-

                              ratios. According to Theorem 10.6a, the left-

                O             hand side does not change if we apply an in-

                              version to each point.

    Consider an inversion in a circle centered at a point O that lies on 

between A and D. By Theorem 10.11, this inversion maps  to a line.

This reduces the problem to the case when A, B, C, and D lie on one

line, which was already considered.

    In the proof above, we rewrite Ptolemy's identity
in a form that is invariant with respect to inversion
and then apply an inversion which makes the state-
ment evident. The solution of the following exercise
is based on the same idea; one has to make a right
choice of inversion.

10.13. Exercise. Assume that four circles are mu-
tually tangent to each other. Show that four (among
six) of their points of tangency lie on one circline.

                                                                                   B

10.14. Advanced exercise. Assume that three cir-

cles tangent to each other and to two parallel lines as

shown in the picture.

    Show that the line passing thru A and B is also             A

tangent to two circles at A.

Perpendicular circles

Assume two circles  and  intersect at two points X and Y . Let  and
m be the tangent lines at X to  and  respectively. Analogously,  and
m be the tangent lines at Y to  and .

    From Exercise 9.26, we get that   m if and only if   m.
                                                       77

    We say that the circle  is perpendicular to the circle  (briefly   )
if they intersect and the lines tangent to the circles at one point (and
therefore, both points) of intersection are perpendicular.

    Similarly, we say that the circle  is perpendicular to the line  (briefly
  ) if    =  and  perpendicular to the tangent lines to 
at one point (and therefore, both points) of intersection. According to
Lemma 5.17, it happens only if the line  passes thru the center of .

    Now we can talk about perpendicular circlines.

10.15. Theorem. Assume  and  are distinct circles. Then    if
and only if the circle  coincides with its inversion in .

Proof. Suppose that  denotes the inverse of .                  
"Only if " part. Let O be the center of  and Q be  YQ

the center of . Let X and Y denote the points of

intersections of  and . According to Lemma 5.17,   OX

   if and only if (OX) and (OY ) are tangent 

to .

Since O = X, Lemma 5.10 implies that O lies

outside of . By Theorem 10.11c,  is a circle.

Note that  is also tangent to (OX) and (OY ) at X and Y respec-

tively. It follows that X and Y are the foot points of the center of  on

(OX) and (OY ). Therefore, both  and  have the center Q. Finally,

 = , since both circles pass thru X.

"If " part. Assume  = .
    Since  = , there is a point P that lies on , but not on . Let P  be

the inverse of P in . Since  = , we have that P   . In particular,
the half-line [OP ) intersects  at two points. By Exercise 5.13, O lies
outside of .

    As  has points inside and outside of , the circles  and  intersect.
The latter follows from Exercise 3.20.

    Let X be a point of their intersection. We need to show that (OX) is
tangent to ; that is, X is the only intersection point of (OX) and .

    Assume Z is another point of intersection of (OX) and . Since O is
outside of , the point Z lies on the half-line [OX).

    Suppose that Z denotes the inverse of Z in . Clearly, the three points
Z, Z, X lie on  and (OX). The latter contradicts Lemma 5.15.

    It is convenient to define the inversion in the line  as the reflection
across . This way we can talk about inversion in an arbitrary circline.

10.16. Corollary. Let  and  be distinct circlines in the inversive
plane. Then the inversion in  sends  to itself if and only if   .
78  CHAPTER 10. INVERSION

Proof. By Theorem 10.15, it is sufficient to consider the case when  or
 is a line.

    Assume  is a line, so the inversion in  is a reflection. In this case,
the statement follows from Corollary 5.7.

    If  is a line, then the statement follows from Theorem 10.11.

10.17. Corollary. Let P and P  be two distinct points such that P  is
the inverse of P in the circle . Assume that the circline  passes thru
P and P . Then   .

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that P is inside and P 
is outside . By Theorem 3.17,  intersects . Suppose that A denotes
a point of intersection.

    Suppose that  denotes the inverse of . Since A is a self-inverse,
the points A, P , and P  lie on . By Exercise 8.2,  =  and by
Theorem 10.15,   .

10.18. Corollary. Let P and Q be two distinct points inside the circle
. Then there is a unique circline  perpendicular to  that passes thru
P and Q.

Proof. Let P  be the inverse of the point P in the circle . According to
Corollary 10.17, the circline is passing thru P and Q is perpendicular to
 if and only if it passes thru P .

    Note that P  lies outside of . Therefore, the points P , P , and Q are
distinct.

    According to Exercise 8.2, there is a unique circline passing thru P ,
Q, and P . Hence the result.

10.19. Exercise. Let P , Q, P , and Q be points in the Euclidean plane.
Assume P  and Q are inverses of P and Q respectively. Show that the
quadrangle P QP Q is inscribed.

10.20. Exercise. Let 1 and 2 be two perpendicular circles with cen-
ters at O1 and O2 respectively. Show that the inverse of O1 in 2 coincides
with the inverse of O2 in 1.

10.21. Exercise. Three distinct circles 1, 2, and 3, intersect at
two points A and B. Assume that a circle  is perpendicular to 1 and
2. Show that   3.

    Let us consider two new construction tools: the circum-tool that con-
structs a circline thru three given points, and the inversion-tool a tool
that constructs an inverse of a given point in a given circline.
                                                                                             79

10.22. Exercise. Given two circles 1, 2 and a point P that does not
lie on the circles, use only circum-tool and inversion-tool to construct a
circline  that passes thru P , and perpendicular to both 1 and 2.

10.23. Advanced exercise. Given three disjoint circles 1, 2 and
3, use only circum-tool and inversion-tool to construct a circline  that
perpendicular to each circle 1, 2, and 3.

    Think what to do if two of the circles intersect.

Angles after inversion

10.24. Proposition. In the inversive plane, the inverse of an arc is an
arc.

Proof. Consider four distinct points A, B, C, and D; let A, B, C, and
D be their inverses. We need to show that D lies on the arc ABC if
and only if D lies on the arc ABC. According to Proposition 9.19, the
latter is equivalent to the following:

              ADC = ABC  ADC = ABC.

The latter follows from Theorem 10.6b.

    The following theorem states that the angle between arcs changes only
its sign after the inversion.

The angle between arcs can be defined as the angle

between its tangent half-lines at the common endpoint.

Therefore under inversion, the angles between arcs are pre-

served up to sign.                                            P
From Exercise 5.24, it follows that the angle between 2

This observation can be used to define the angle between a pair of curves
emerging from one point. It turns out that under inversion, angles be-
tween curves are also preserved up to sign.

Proof. Applying to Proposition 9.23,

     X1AX2  X1AC1 + C1AC2 + C2AX2 
                   ( - C1B1A) + C1AC2 + ( - AB2C2) 
                   -(C1B1A + AB2C2 + C2AC1) 
                   -(C1B1A + AB2C1) - (C1B2C2 + C2AC1).

In the same way, we get that

    Y1AY2           -(C1 B1 A       +     AB2 C1 )       -            +  C2 AC1 ).

    By Theorem 10.6b,

                C1B1A + AB2C1  -(C1 B1 A + AB2 C1 ),
               C1B2C2 + C2AC1  -(C1 B2 C2 + C2 AC1 )

and hence the result.

Neutral plane

Let us remove Axiom V from our axiomatic system (see page 19). This
way we define a new object called neutral plane or absolute plane. (In a
neutral plane, the Axiom V may or may not hold.)

    Clearly, any theorem in neutral geometry holds in Euclidean geometry.
In other words, the Euclidean plane is an example of a neutral plane. In
the next chapter, we will construct an example of a neutral plane that is
not Euclidean.

    In this book, the Axiom V was used starting from Chapter 6. There-
fore all the statements before hold in neutral geometry.

    It makes all the discussed results about half-planes, signs of angles,
congruence conditions, perpendicular lines, and reflections true in neutral
geometry. Recall that a statement above marked with " " (for example,
"Theorem. ") if it holds in any neutral plane and the same proof works.

    Let us give an example of a theorem in neutral geometry that admits
a simpler proof in Euclidean geometry.
11.1. Hypotenuse-leg congruence condition. Assume that trian-
gles ABC and ABC have right angles at C and C respectively, AB =
= AB and AC = AC. Then ABC = ABC.

Euclidean proof. By the Pythagorean theorem BC = BC. Then the
statement follows from the SSS congruence condition.

    The proof of the Pythagorean theorem used properties of similar tri-
angles, which in turn used Axiom V. Therefore this proof does not work
in a neutral plane.
Neutral proof. Suppose that D denotes the reflection of A across (BC)
and D denotes the reflection of A across (BC). Note that

      AD = 2·AC = 2·AC = AD, BD = BA = BA = BD.

82                          CHAPTER 11. NEUTRAL PLANE

    By SSS congruence condition (4.4), we get that    B

ABD = ABD.

    The statement follows since C is the midpoint of

[AD] and C is the midpoint of [AD].

11.2. Exercise. Give a proof of Exercise 8.12 that D C A
works in the neutral plane.

11.3. Exercise. Let ABCD be an inscribed quadrangle in the neutral
plane. Show that

                       ABC + CDA  BCD + DAB.

    Note that one cannot use Corollary 9.13 to solve the exercise above,
since it uses Theorems 9.1 and 9.2, which in turn uses Theorem 7.12.

Two angles of a triangle

In this section, we will prove a weaker form of Theorem 7.12 which holds
in any neutral plane.

11.4. Proposition. Let ABC be a nondegenerate triangle in the neu-
tral plane. Then

                               |CAB| + |ABC| < .

    Note that according to 3.7, the angles ABC, BCA, and CAB have
the same sign. Therefore, in the Euclidean plane, the theorem follows
immediately from Theorem 7.12.

          Proof. Let X be the reflection of C across the midpoint

    B     X M of [AB]. By Proposition 7.6 BAX = ABC and

          therefore

       M                    CAX  CAB + ABC.

                     Since [BM ] and [M X] do not intersect (CA), the

C      A  points B, M , and X lie on the same side of (CA). There-

          fore the angles CAB and CAX have the same sign. By

3.7, the angles CAB, ABC have the same sign; that is all angles in 

have the same sign.

    Note that CAX  ; otherwise, X would lie on (AC). Therefore

the identity  implies that

          |CAB| + |ABC| = |CAX| < .
                                                                                             83

11.5. Exercise. Assume A, B, C, and D are points in a neutral plane
such that

                               2·ABC + 2·BCD  0.
Show that (AB) (CD).

    Note that one cannot apply the transversal property (7.9).

11.6. Exercise. Prove the side-angle-angle congruence condition in the
neutral geometry.

    In other words, let ABC and ABC be two triangles in a neutral
plane; suppose that ABC is nondegenerate. Show that ABC =
= ABC if

    AB = AB, ABC = ±ABC and BCA = ±BCA.

    Note that in the Euclidean plane, the above exercise follows from
ASA and the theorem on the sum of angles of a triangle (7.12). However,
Theorem 7.12 cannot be used here, since its proof uses Axiom V. Later
(Theorem 13.7) we will show that Theorem 7.12 does not hold in a neutral
plane.

11.7. Exercise. Assume that point D lies between the vertices A and B
of ABC in a neutral plane. Show that

                             CD < CA or CD < CB.

Three angles of triangle

11.8. Proposition. Let ABC and ABC be two triangles in the
neutral plane such that AC = AC and BC = BC. Then

              AB < AB if and only if |ACB| < |ACB|.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may                 X

assume that A = A, C = C, and B                              B

ACB, ACB 0. In this case, we need

to show that

AB < AB  ACB < ACB.                                    C        A

Choose a point X so that

              ACX  =      1  ·  (  AC  B  +  AC B  ).
                          2

Note that
84                                              CHAPTER 11. NEUTRAL PLANE

     (CX) bisects BCB.
     (CX) is the perpendicular bisector of [BB].
     A and B lie on the same side of (CX) if and only if

                                       ACB < ACB.

From Exercise 5.3, A and B lie on the same side of (CX) if and only if
AB < AB. Hence the result.

11.9. Theorem. Let ABC be a triangle in the neutral plane. Then

                        |ABC| + |BCA| + |CAB| .

    The following proof is due to Legendre [12], earlier proofs were due to
Saccheri [16] and Lambert [11].

Proof. Set

        a = BC,                     b = CA,                c = AB,
         = CAB,                      = ABC,                 = BCA.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that , ,  0.

    A0   cccc   cccc
                   A1

    Fix a positive integer n. Consider the points A0, A1, . . . , An on the
half-line [BA), such that BAi = i·c for each i. (In particular, A0 =
= B and A1 = A.) Let us construct the points C1, C2, . . . , Cn, so that
AiAi-1Ci =  and Ai-1Ci = a for each i.

    By SAS, we have constructed n congruent triangles

          ABC = A1A0C1 = A2A1C2 = . . . = AnAn-1Cn.

    Set d = C1C2 and  = C2A1C1. Note that

                                     +  +  = .

By Proposition 11.4, we get that  0.
    By construction

                A1C1C2 = A2C2C3 = . . . = An-1Cn-1Cn.
                                                                                 85

In particular, CiCi+1 = d for each i.
    By repeated application of the triangle inequality, we get that

        n·c = A0An
                A0C1 + C1C2 + · · · + Cn-1Cn + CnAn =

             = a + (n - 1)·d + b.

In particular,

                  c  d       +  1  ·(a  +  b  -  d).
                                n

Since n is an arbitrary positive integer, the latter implies c                   d. By

Proposition 11.8, it is equivalent to

                                 .

From , the theorem follows.

11.10. Exercise. Let ABCD be a quadrangle in the neutral plane. Sup-
pose that the angles DAB and ABC are right. Show that AB CD.

Defect

The defect of triangle ABC is defined as

defect(ABC) :=  - |ABC| - |BCA| - |CAB|.

Note that Theorem 11.9 states that the defect of any triangle in a

neutral plane has to be nonnegative. According to Theorem 7.12, any

triangle in the Euclidean plane has zero defect.

11.11. Exercise. Let ABC be a nondegenerate tri-                              C

and B. Show that

defect(ABC) = defect(ADC) + defect(DBC). A D B

C across the midpoint M of [AB]. Show that
                                                                                    A

11.13. Exercise. Suppose that ABCD is a rectangle in a neutral plane;
that is, ABCD is a quadrangle with all right angles. Show that AB =

11.14. Advanced exercise. Show that if a neutral plane has a rectan-
gle, then all its triangles have zero defect.
86  CHAPTER 11. NEUTRAL PLANE

How to prove that something

cannot be proved

Many attempts were made to prove that any theorem in Euclidean geom-
etry holds in neutral geometry. The latter is equivalent to the statement
that Axiom V is a theorem in neutral geometry.

    Some of these attempts were accepted as proof for long periods, until
a mistake was found.

    There are many statements in neutral geometry that are equivalent to
the Axiom V. It means that if we exchange the Axiom V to any of these
statements, then we will obtain an equivalent axiomatic system.

    The following theorem provides a short list of such statements. We
are not going to prove it in the book.

11.15. Theorem. A neutral plane is Euclidean if and only if one of the
following equivalent conditions holds:

  (a) There is a line  and a point P /  such that there is only one line
       passing thru P and parallel to .

  (b) Every nondegenerate triangle can be circumscribed.
  (c) There exists a pair of distinct lines that lie at a bounded distance

       from each other.
  (d) There is a triangle with an arbitrarily large inradius.
  (e) There is a nondegenerate triangle with zero defect.
  (f ) There exists a quadrangle in which all the angles are right.

    It is hard to imagine a neutral plane that does not satisfy some of the
properties above. That is partly the reason for a large number of false
proofs; each used one of such statements by accident.

    Let us formulate the negation of (a) above as a new axiom; we label
it h-V as a hyperbolic version of Axiom V on page 19.

h-V. For any line  and any point P /  there are at least two lines
       that pass thru P and parallel to .

    By Theorem 7.2, a neutral plane that satisfies Axiom h-V is not Eu-
clidean. Moreover, according to Theorem 11.15 (which we do not prove)
in any non-Euclidean neutral plane, Axiom h-V holds.

    It opens a way to look for a proof by contradiction. Simply exchange
Axiom V to Axiom h-V and start to prove theorems in the obtained ax-
iomatic system. In the case if we arrive at a contradiction, we prove the
Axiom V in a neutral plane. This idea was growing since the 5th century;
the most notable results were obtained by Saccheri in [16].
                                                                                             87

    The system of axioms I-IV and h-V defines a new geometry which is
now called hyperbolic or Lobachevskian geometry. The more this geome-
try was developed, it became more and more believable that there is no
contradiction; that is, the system of axioms I-IV, and h-V is consistent.
In fact, the following theorem holds true:

11.16. Theorem. The hyperbolic geometry is consistent if and only if
so is the Euclidean geometry.

    The claims that hyperbolic geometry has no contradiction can be
found in private letters of Gauss, Schweikart, and Taurinus.1 They all
seem to be afraid to state it in public. For instance, in 1818 Gauss writes
to Gerling:

            . . . I am happy that you have the courage to express yourself
       as if you recognized the possibility that our parallels theory
       along with our entire geometry could be false. But the wasps
       whose nest you disturb will fly around your head.

    Lobachevsky came to the same conclusion independently. Unlike the
others, he dared to state it in public (and in print; see [13]). That cost
him serious troubles. A couple of years later, also independently, Bolyai
published his work (see [6]).

    It seems that Lobachevsky was the first who had a proof of Theo-
rem 11.16 altho its formulation required rigorous axiomatics which wes
not developed at his time. Later, Beltrami gave a cleaner proof of the
"if" part of the theorem. It was done by modeling points, lines, distances,
and angle measures of one geometry using some other objects in another
geometry. The same idea was used earlier by Lobachevsky; in [14, §34]
he modeled the Euclidean plane in the hyperbolic space.

    The proof of Beltrami is the subject of the next chapter.

Curvature

In a letter from 1824 Gauss writes:
            The assumption that the sum of the three angles is less

       than  leads to a curious geometry, quite different from ours
       but completely consistent, which I have developed to my en-
       tire satisfaction, so that I can solve every problem in it with
       the exception of a determination of a constant, which cannot
       be designated a priori. The greater one takes this constant,
       the nearer one comes to Euclidean geometry, and when it is
       chosen indefinitely large the two coincide. The theorems of

    1The oldest surviving letters were the Gauss letter to Gerling in 1816 and yet more
convincing letter dated 1818 of Schweikart sent to Gauss via Gerling.
88                    CHAPTER 11. NEUTRAL PLANE

       this geometry appear to be paradoxical and, to the uninitiated,
       absurd; but calm, steady reflection reveals that they contain
       nothing at all impossible. For example, the three angles of a
       triangle become as small as one wishes, if only the sides are
       taken large enuf; yet the area of the triangle can never exceed
       a definite limit, regardless how great the sides are taken, nor
       indeed can it ever reach it.
    In modernterminology, the constant that Gauss mentions can be ex-
pressed as 1/ -k, where k 0, is the so-called curvature of the neutral
plane, which we are about to introduce.
    The identity in Exercise 11.11 suggests that the defect of a triangle
should be proportional to its area.2
    In fact, for any neutral plane, there is a nonpositive real number k
such that

                       k· area(ABC) + defect(ABC) = 0

for any ABC. This number k is called the curvature of the plane.
    For example, by Theorem 7.12, the Euclidean plane has zero curvature.

By Theorem 11.9, the curvature of any neutral plane is nonpositive.
    It turns out that up to isometry, the neutral plane is characterized by

its curvature; that is, two neutral planes are isometric if and only if they
have the same curvature.

    In the next chapter, we will construct a hyperbolic plane; this is, an
example of a neutral plane with curvature k = -1.

    Any neutral planes, distinct from Euclidean, can be obtained by scal-
ing the metric on the hyperbolic plane. Indeed, if we scale the metric by
a positive factor c, the area changes by factor c2, while the defect stays
the same. Therefore, taking c = -k, we can get the neutral plane of
the given curvature k < 0. In other words, all the non-Euclidean neutral
planes become identical if we use r = 1/ -k as the unit of length.

    In Chapter 16, we discuss spherical geometry. Altho spheres are not
neutral planes, the spherical geometry is a close relative of Euclidean and
hyperbolic geometries.

    Nondegenerate spherical triangles have negative defects. Moreover, if
R is the radius of the sphere, then

     1  ·  area(ABC)  +  defect(ABC)  =  0
    R2

for any spherical triangle ABC. In other words, the sphere of the radius
R has the curvature k = R2 1 .

    2The area in the neutral plane is discussed briefly in the end of Chapter 20, but the
reader could also refer to an intuitive understanding of area measurement.
Chapter 12

Hyperbolic plane

    In this chapter, we use inversive geometry to construct the model of a
hyperbolic plane a neutral plane that is not Euclidean.

    Namely, we construct the so-called conformal disc model of the hyper-
bolic plane. This model was discovered by Beltrami [4]; it is often called
the Poincar´e disc model.

    The figure above shows the conformal disc model of the hyperbolic
plane which is cut into congruent triangles with angles 3 , 3 , and 4 .

90                        CHAPTER 12. HYPERBOLIC PLANE

Conformal disc model

In this section, we give new names for some objects in the Euclidean plane
which will represent lines, angle measures, and distances in the hyperbolic
plane.

Hyperbolic plane. Let us fix a circle on the Euclidean plane and call it
absolute. The set of points inside the absolute will be called the hyperbolic
plane (or h-plane).

    Note that the points on the absolute do not belong to the h-plane.
The points in the h-plane will be also called h-points.

    Often we will assume that the absolute is a unit circle.

Hyperbolic lines. The intersections of the h-plane with circlines per-

pendicular to the absolute are called hyperbolic lines or h-lines.

                                   By Corollary 10.18, there is a unique

        B                   h-line that passes thru the given two
    Q                       distinct h-points P and Q. This h-line
                            will be denoted by (P Q)h.

    h-plane                        The arcs of hyperbolic lines will

                            be called hyperbolic segments or h-

                     A      segments. An h-segment with endpoints

                            P and Q will be denoted by [P Q]h.

                                   The subset of an h-line on one side

                            from a point will be called a hyperbolic

half-line (or h-half-line). More precisely, an h-half-line is an intersection

of the h-plane with arc perpendicular to the absolute that has exactly one

of its endpoints in the h-plane. An h-half-line starting at P and passing

thru Q will be denoted by [P Q)h.

    If  is the circline containing the h-line (P Q)h, then the points of

intersection of  with the absolute are called ideal points of (P Q)h. (Note

that the ideal points of an h-line do not belong to the h-line.)

    An ordered triple of h-points, say (P, Q, R) will be called h-triangle

P QR and denoted by hP QR.

    Let us point out, that so far an h-line (P Q)h is just a subset of the

h-plane; below we will introduce h-distance and later we will show that

(P Q)h is a line for the h-distance in the sense of the Definition 1.9.

12.1. Exercise. Show that an h-line is uniquely determined by its ideal
points.

12.2. Exercise. Show that an h-line is uniquely determined by one of
its ideal points and one h-point on it.
                                                                                             91

12.3. Exercise. Show that the h-segment [P Q]h coincides with the Eu-
clidean segment [P Q] if and only if the line (P Q) passes thru the center
of the absolute.

Hyperbolic distance. Let P and Q be distinct h-points; let A and B
denote the ideal points of (P Q)h. Without loss of generality, we may
assume that on the Euclidean circline containing the h-line (P Q)h, the
points A, P, Q, B appear in the same order.

    Consider the function
                                  (P, Q) := AQ·P B .
                                                 AP ·QB

Note that the right-hand side is a cross-ratio; by Theorem 10.6 it is in-
variant under inversion. Set (P, P ) = 1 for any h-point P . Let us define
h-distance as the logarithm of ; that is,

                                   P Qh := ln[(P, Q)].

    The proof that P Qh is a metric on the h-plane will be given later. For
now, it is just a function that returns a real value P Qh for any pair of
h-points P and Q.

12.4. Exercise. Let O be the center of the absolute and the h-points O,
X, and Y lie on one h-line in the same order. Assume OX = XY . Prove
that OXh < XYh.

Hyperbolic angles. Consider three h-points P , Q, and R such that
P = Q and R = Q. The hyperbolic angle P QR (briefly hP QR) is an
ordered pair of h-half-lines [QP )h and [QR)h.

    Let [QX) and [QY ) be (Euclidean) half-lines that are tangent to [QP ]h
and [QR]h at Q. Then the hyperbolic angle measure (or h-angle measure)
of hP QR is denoted by hP QR and defined as XQY .

12.5. Exercise. Let  be an h-line and P be an h-point that does not lie
on . Show that there is a unique h-line passing thru P and perpendicular
to .

Plan of the proof

We defined all the h-notions needed in the formulation of the axioms I-IV
and h-V. It remains to show that all these axioms hold; this will be done
by the end of this chapter.

    Once we are done with the proofs, we get that the model provides an
example of a neutral plane; in particular, Exercise 12.5 can be proved the
same way as Theorem 5.5.
92                           CHAPTER 12. HYPERBOLIC PLANE

    Most importantly we will prove the "if"-part of Theorem 11.16.
    Indeed, any statement in hyperbolic geometry can be restated in the
Euclidean plane using the introduced h-notions. Therefore, if the system
of axioms I-IV, and h-V leads to a contradiction, then so does the system
axioms I-V.

Auxiliary statements

One may compare the conformal model with a telescope it makes it
possible to see the h-plane from the Euclidean plane. Continuing this
analogy further, we may say that the following lemma will be used to aim
the telescope at any particular point in the h-plane.

12.6. Lemma. Consider an h-plane with a unit circle as the absolute.
Let O be the center of the absolute and P be another h-point. Suppose
that P  denotes the inverse of P in the absolute. 

    Then the circle  with the center P  and radius 1-OP 2 OP is perpendic-
ular to the absolute. Moreover, O is the inverse of P in .

                                Proof. Follows by Exercise 10.20.

     T

                                Assume  is a circline that is perpen-

     O P P                      dicular to the absolute. Consider the in-
                                version X  X in , or if  is a line, set
                                X  X to be the reflection across .

                                The following observation says that

                                the map X  X respects all the notions

                                introduced in the previous section. To-

gether with the lemma above, it implies that in any problem that is for-

mulated entirely in h-terms we can assume that a given h-point lies in

the center of the absolute.

12.7. Main observation. The map X  X described above is a bijec-

tion from the h-plane to itself. Moreover, for any h-points P , Q, R such

that P = Q and Q = R, the following conditions hold:

(a) The h-line (P Q)h, h-half-line [P Q)h, and h-segment [P Q]h are trans-
     formed into (P Q)h, [P Q)h, and [P Q]h respectively.

(b)  (P , Q) = (P, Q)  and   P  Q      =  P  Qh.

(c) hP QR  -hP QR.                  h

    It is instructive to compare this observation with Proposition 5.6.

Proof. According to Theorem 10.15, the map sends the absolute to itself.
Note that the points on  do not move, it follows that points inside of
                                                          93

the absolute remain inside after the mapping. Whence the X  X is a
bijection from the h-plane to itself.

    Part (a) follows from 10.7 and 10.25.
    Part (b) follows from Theorem 10.6.
    Part (c) follows from Theorem 10.25.

12.8. Lemma. Assume that the absolute is a unit circle centered at O.
Given an h-point P , set x = OP and y = OPh. Then

                  1+x  and                        ey - 1
y = ln                                            x= y .
                  1-x                             e +1

    Observe that according to lemma, OPh   as OP  1. That is
if P approaches absolute in Euclidean sense, it escapes to infinity in the
h-sense.

Proof. Note that the h-line (OP )h forms a                       B
diameter of the absolute. If A and B are the      OP
ideal points as in the definition of h-distance,
then A

                    OA = OB = 1,
                    P A = 1 + x,
                    P B = 1 - x.

In particular,

                  y = ln AP ·BO = ln 1 + x .
                       P B·OA        1-x

    Taking the exponential function of the left and the right-hand side
and applying obvious algebra manipulations, we get that

                             ey - 1
                       x= y .

                             e +1

12.9. Lemma. Assume the points P , Q, and R appear on one h-line in
the same order. Then

                                  P Qh + QRh = P Rh.

Proof. Note that

                       P Qh + QRh = P Rh
94                           CHAPTER 12. HYPERBOLIC PLANE

is equivalent to        (P, Q)·(Q, R) = (P, R).


    Let A and B be the ideal points of (P Q)h. Without loss of generality,
we can assume that the points A, P , Q, R, and B appear in the same
order on the circline containing (P Q)h. Then

                      (P, Q)·(Q, R) = AQ·BP · AR·BQ =
                                               QB·P A RB·QA

                                           = AR·BP =
                                               RB·P A

                                           = (P, R).

Hence  follows.

    Let P be an h-point and  > 0. The set of all h-points Q such that
P Qh =  is called an h-circle with the center P and the h-radius .

12.10. Lemma. Any h-circle is a Euclidean circle that lies completely

in the h-plane.

    More precisely for any h-point P and  0 there is a ^            0 and a
point P^ such that

                             P Qh =   P^Q = ^

for any h-point Q.
    Moreover, if O is the center of the absolute, then
   1. O^ = O for any  and
   2. P^  (OP ) for any P = O.

Proof. According to Lemma 12.8, OQh =  if and only if

                                      e - 1
                        OQ = ^ =  .

                                      e +1

Therefore, the locus of h-points Q such that OQh =  is a Euclidean

circle, denote it by .

                        If P = O, then by Lemma 12.6 and the main

                        observation (12.7) there is an inversion that re-

                        spects all h-notions and sends O  P .

             P^         Let       be  the  inverse  of  .    Since the in-
    OP
                                
      Q
                        version preserves the h-distance, P Qh =  if and

                        only if Q  .                    

                        According  to  Theorem   10.7,       is  a  Euclidean

                        circle. Let P^ and ^ denote the Euclidean center

                        and radius of .
                                                                                       95

Finally,  note     that       reflects  to  itself  across  (OP );  that  is,  the  center

                            

P^ lies on (OP ).

12.11. Exercise. Assume P , P^, and O are as in the Lemma 12.10 and
P = O. Show that P^  [OP ].

Axiom I

Evidently, the h-plane contains at least two points. Therefore, to show
that Axiom I holds in the h-plane, we need to show that the h-distance
defined on page 91 is a metric on h-plane; that is, the conditions (a)-(d)
in Definition 1.1 hold for h-distance.

    The following claim says that the h-distance meets the conditions (a)
and (b).

12.12. Claim. Given the h-points P and Q, we have P Qh                              0 and
P Qh = 0 if and only if P = Q.

Proof. According to Lemma 12.6 and the main observation (12.7), we
may assume that Q is the center of the absolute. In this case

                              (Q, P ) = 1 + QP 1
                                            1 - QP

and therefore

                              QPh = ln[(Q, P )] 0.

Moreover, the equalities hold if and only if P = Q.

The following claim says that the h-distance meets Condition 1.1c.

12.13. Claim. For any h-points P and Q, we have P Qh = QPh.

Proof. Let A and B be ideal points of (P Q)h and A, P, Q, B appear on

the circline containing (P Q)h in the same order.

Then                                                                                B

               P Qh = ln AQ·BP =                                               Q
                            QB·P A
                                                                                P
                      = ln BP ·AQ =                                                    A
                            P A·QB

                      = QPh.

    The following claim shows, in particular, that the triangle inequality
(which is condition 1.1d) holds for h-distance.
96                          CHAPTER 12. HYPERBOLIC PLANE

12.14. Claim. Given a triple of h-points P , Q, and R, we have

                                  P Qh + QRh P Rh.

Moreover, the equality holds if and only if P , Q, and R lie on one h-line
in the same order.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that P is the center of
the absolute and P Qh QRh > 0.

    Suppose that  denotes the h-circle with the center Q and h-radius
 = QRh. Let S and T be the points of intersection of (P Q) and .

    By Lemma 12.9, P Qh QRh. Therefore, we can assume that the
points P , S, Q, and T appear on the h-line in the same order.

    According to Lemma 12.10,  is a Euclidean circle; suppose that Q^
denotes its Euclidean center. Note that Q^ is the Euclidean midpoint
of [ST ].

                                     By the Euclidean triangle inequality,

                            P T = P Q^ + Q^R P R

                          and the equality holds if and only if T = R.

                            By Lemma 12.8,

         S Q^               P Th = ln 1 + P T ,
P QT                                     1 - PT

       R                    P Rh = ln 1 + P R .
                                         1 - PR

                          Since the function f (x) = ln 1-x 1+x is increasing
                          for x  [0, 1), inequality  implies

                            P Th P Rh

                                and the equality holds if and only if T = R.
    Finally, applying Lemma 12.9 again, we get that

                          P Th = P Qh + QRh.

Hence the claim follows.

Axiom II

Note that once the following claim is proved, Axiom II follows from Corol-
lary 10.18.
                                               97

12.15. Claim. A subset of the h-plane is an h-line if and only if it
forms a line for the h-distance in the sense of Definition 1.9.

Proof. Let  be an h-line. Applying the main observation (12.7) we can
assume that  contains the center of the absolute. In this case,  is an
intersection of a diameter of the absolute and the h-plane. Let A and B
be the endpoints of the diameter.

    Consider the map  :   R defined as

                                      (X) = ln AX .
                                                   XB

Note that  :   R is a bijection.
    Further, if X, Y   and the points A, X, Y , and B appear on [AB]

in the same order, then

(Y ) - (X) = ln AY - ln AX = ln AY ·BX = XYh.
YB  XB  Y B·XB

    We proved that any h-line is a line for h-distance. The converse follows
from Claim 12.14.

Axiom III

Note that the first part of Axiom III follows directly from the definition
of the h-angle measure defined on page 91. It remains to show that h
satisfies the conditions IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc on page 19.

    The following two claims say that h satisfies IIIa and IIIb.
12.16. Claim. Given an h-half-line [OP )h and   (-, ], there is a
unique h-half-line [OQ)h such that hP OQ = .

12.17. Claim. For any h-points P , Q, and R distinct from an h-point
O, we have

                           hP OQ + hQOR  hP OR.

Proof of 12.16 and 12.17. Applying the main observation, we may assume
that O is the center of the absolute. In this case, for any h-point P = O,
the h-half-line [OP )h is the intersection of the Euclidean half-line [OP )
with h-plane. Hence the claims 12.16 and 12.17 follow from the axioms
IIIa and IIIb of the Euclidean plane.

    The following claim says that h satisfies IIIc.

12.18. Claim. The function

                               h : (P, Q, R)  hP QR
98                                  CHAPTER 12. HYPERBOLIC PLANE

is continuous at any triple of points (P, Q, R) such that Q = P , Q = R,
and hP QR = .

Proof. Suppose that O denotes the center of the absolute. We can assume
that Q is distinct from O.

    Suppose that Z denotes the inverse of Q in the absolute; suppose that
 denotes the circle perpendicular to the absolute and centered at Z.
According to Lemma 12.6, the point O is the inverse of Q in .

    Let P  and R denote the inversions in  of the points P and R re-
spectively. Note that the point P  is completely determined by Q and P .
Moreover, the map (Q, P )  P  is continuous at any pair of points (Q, P )
such that Q = O. The same is true for the map (Q, R)  R

    According to the main observation

                                hP QR  -hP OR.

Since hP OR = P OR and the maps (Q, P )  P , (Q, R)  R
are continuous, the claim follows from the corresponding axiom of the
Euclidean plane.

Axiom IV

The following claim says that Axiom IV holds in the h-plane.

12.19. Claim.          In the h-plane, we have hP QR = hP QR if and
only if

    QP        =  QPh,  QR        =  QRh  and  hP QR = ±P QR.

           h                  h

Proof. Applying the main observation, we can assume that Q and Q
coincide with the center of the absolute; in particular, Q = Q. In this

case,
                 P QR = hP QR = ±hP QR = ±P QR.

Since

                       QPh = QPh and QRh = QRh ,

Lemma 12.8 implies that the same holds for the Euclidean distances; that

is,
                           QP = QP  and QR = QR.

By SAS, there is a motion of the Euclidean plane that sends Q to itself,
P to P , and R to R.

    Note that the center of the absolute is fixed by the corresponding

motion. It follows that this motion gives also a motion of the h-plane; in
particular, the h-triangles hP QR and hP QR are h-congruent.
                                                               99

Axiom h-V

Finally, we need to check that the Axiom h-V on page 86 holds; that is,
we need to prove the following claim.

12.20. Claim. For any h-line  and any h-point
P /  there are at least two h-lines that pass thru
P and have no points of intersection with .

can assume that P is the center of the absolute.

    The remaining part of the proof can be guessed
from the picture.

12.21. Exercise. Show that in the h-plane there are 3 mutually paral-
lel h-lines such that any pair of these three lines lies on one side of the

Hyperbolic trigonometry

In this section, we give formulas for h-distance using hyperbolic functions.
One of these formulas will be used in the proof of the hyperbolic Pythag-
orean theorem (13.13).

    Recall that ch, sh, and th denote hyperbolic cosine, hyperbolic sine,
and hyperbolic tangent ; that is, the functions defined by

                          ch x := 2 ex+e-x , sh x := 2 ex-e-x ,

                                        th x := sh x ch x .
    These hyperbolic functions are analogous to sine and cosine and tan-
gent.

12.22. Exercise. Prove the following identities:

              ch x = sh x; sh x = ch x; (ch x)2 - (sh x)2 = 1.

12.23. Double-argument identities. The identities
      ch(2·x) = (ch x)2 + (sh x)2 and sh(2·x) = 2· sh x· ch x

hold for any real value x.

Geometry of the h-plane

In this chapter, we study the geometry of the plane described by the
conformal disc model. For briefness, this plane will be called the h-plane.

    We can work with this model directly from inside of the Euclidean
plane. We may also use the axioms of neutral geometry since they all
hold in the h-plane; the latter proved in the previous chapter.

Angle of parallelism

Let P be a point off an h-line . Drop a perpendicular (P Q)h from P to

; let Q be its foot point. Let  be the smallest value such that the h-line

(P Z)h with |hQP Z| =  does not intersect .

The value  is called the angle of parallelism of P to . Clearly, 

depends only on the h-distance s = P Qh. Further, (s)  /2 as s  0,

and (s)  0 as s  . (In Euclidean geometry, the angle of parallelism

is identically equal to /2.)

If , P , and Z are as above, then the h-line                  Z

m = (P Z)h is called asymptotically parallel to .

In other words, two h-lines are asymptotically                P Q
parallel if they share one ideal point. (In hyper-

bolic geometry, the term parallel lines is often                 

used for asymptotically parallel lines; we do not

follow this convention.)

Given P  , there are exactly two asymp-

totically parallel lines thru P to ; the remaining parallel lines are called

ultra parallel.

On the diagram, the two solid h-lines passing thru P are asymptoti-

cally parallel to ; the dashed h-line is ultra parallel to .

102            CHAPTER 13. GEOMETRY OF THE H-PLANE

13.1. Exercise. Show that two distinct h-lines  and m are ultraparallel
if and only if they have a common perpendicular; that is, there is an
h-line n such that n   and n  m.

13.2. Proposition. Let Q be the foot point of P on h-line . Then

                   P Qh = 21 · ln 1 + cos  1 - cos  ,

where  is the angle of parallelism of P to .

In particular, if P /  and  = |hXP Y | for some points X, Y  ,

then                  1 1 + cos 2

                   P Qh < 2 · ln  1 - cos 2      .

                         Proof. Applying a motion of the h-

                   B     plane if necessary, we may assume P

                         is the center of the absolute. Then the

                         h-lines thru P are the intersections of

               QX     Z Euclidean lines with the h-plane.
      P                           Let A and B denote the ideal

                         points of . Without loss of generality,

                   A     we may assume that AP B is posi-

                         tive. In this case,

                                  =  QP B              =  AP Q  =  1  ·    AP  B  .
                                                                   2

    Let Z be the center of the circle  containing the h-line . Set X
to be the point of intersection of the Euclidean segment [AB] and the
line (P Q).

    Note that, P X = cos . Therefore, by Lemma 12.8,

                      P Xh = ln 1-cos  1+cos  .

    Note that both angles P BZ and BXZ are right. Since the angle P ZB
is shared, ZBX  ZP B. In particular,

                      ZX·ZP = ZB2;

that is, X is the inverse of P in .
    The inversion in  is the reflection of the h-plane across . Therefore

                   P Qh = QXh =

                      =  1  ·  P  Xh  =

Proof. Let I and r be the h-incenter and h-inradius of hXY Z.
    Note that the h-angles XIY , Y IZ and ZIX have the same sign.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that all of them are positive
and therefore

                        hXIY + hY IZ + hZIX = 2·

    We can assume that hXIY                          2  ·;  if

104                 CHAPTER 13. GEOMETRY OF THE H-PLANE

Circles, horocycles, and equidistants

Note that according to Lemma 12.10, any h-circle is a Euclidean circle
that lies completely in the h-plane. Further, any h-line is an intersection
of the h-plane with the circle perpendicular to the absolute.

    In this section, we will describe the h-geometric meaning of the inter-
sections of the other circles with the h-plane.

    You will see that all these intersections have a perfectly round shape
in the h-plane.

    One may think of these curves as trajectories of a car with a fixed
position of the steering wheel. In the Euclidean plane, this way you
either run along a circle or along a line.

    In the hyperbolic plane, the picture is different. If you turn the steering
wheel to the far right, you will run along a circle. If you turn it less, at a
certain position of the wheel, you will never come back to the same point,
but the path will be different from the line. If you turn the wheel further
a bit, you start to run along a path that stays at some fixed distance from
an h-line.

Equidistants of h-lines. Consider the h-plane with the absolute .

Assume a circle  intersects  in two distinct points, A and B. Suppose

that g denotes the intersection of  with the h-plane.

                           Let us draw an h-line m with the ideal

        A                  points A and B. According to Exer-

              P            cise 12.1, m is uniquely defined.

                           Consider any h-line  perpendicular

                           to m; let  be the circle containing .

                 P         Note that   . Indeed, accord-

     m                     ing to Corollary 10.16, m and  invert

           g               to themselves in . It follows that A is
                           the inverse of B in . Finally, by Corol-
     B                     lary 10.17, we get that   .

                           Therefore, inversion in  sends both

m and g to themselves. For any two points P , P  g there is a choice

of  and  as above such that P  is the inverse of P in . By the main

observation (12.7) the inversion in  is a motion of the h-plane. Therefore,

all points of g lie at the same distance from m.

  In other words, g is the set of points that lie at a fixed h-distance and

on the same side of m.

  Such a curve g is called equidistant to h-line m. In Euclidean geometry,

the equidistant from a line is a line; apparently, in hyperbolic geometry,

the picture is different.

Horocycles. If the circle  touches the absolute from inside at one point
A, then the complement h = \{A} lies in the h-plane. This set is called
                                                                     105

a horocycle. It also has a perfectly round shape       in the sense  described
above.                                                  A            horocycle,

    The shape of a horocycle is between shapes of                  
circles and equidistants to h-lines. A horocycle       an h-circle,
might be considered as a limit of circles thru a
fixed point with the centers running to infinity
along a line. The same horocycle is a limit of
equidistants thru a fixed point to sequence of h-
lines that runs to infinity.

    Since any three points lie on a circline, we have
that any nondegenerate h-triangle is inscribed in
or equidistant.

13.6. Exercise. Find the leg of an isosceles right h-triangle inscribed in
a horocycle.

Hyperbolic triangles

13.7. Theorem. Any nondegenerate hyperbolic triangle has a positive
defect.

Proof. Fix an h-triangle ABC. According to
Theorem 11.9,

  defect(hABC) 0.                                      B
                                                           DC
It remains to show that in the case of equality,
hABC degenerates.                                         A

    Without loss of generality, we may assume
that A is the center of the absolute; in this case,
hCAB = CAB. Yet we may assume that

  hCAB, hABC, hBCA, ABC, BCA 0.

    Let D be an arbitrary point in [CB]h distinct from B and C. From
Proposition 9.23, we have

  ABC - hABC   - CDB  BCA - hBCA.

  From Exercise 7.14, we get that

  defect(hABC) = 2·( - CDB).

Therefore, if we have equality in , then CDB = . In particular,
the h-segment [BC]h coincides with the Euclidean segment [BC]. By
106                     CHAPTER 13. GEOMETRY OF THE H-PLANE

Exercise 12.3, the latter can happen only if the h-line (BC)h passes thru
the center of the absolute (A); that is, if hABC degenerates.

    The following theorem states, in particular, that nondegenerate hyper-
bolic triangles are congruent if their corresponding angles are equal. In
particular, in hyperbolic geometry, similar triangles have to be congruent.

13.8. AAA congruence condition. Two nondegenerate h-triangles
ABC and ABC are congruent if hABC = ±hABC, hBCA =
= ±hBCA and hCAB = ±hCAB.

Proof.  Note  that  if  ABh  =  AB ,      then  the  theorem  follows  from  ASA.

                                       h

                             Assume the contrary. Without loss of general-

  A                       ity, we may assume that ABh < ABh . Therefore,

                          we can choose the point B  [AB]h such that

                          AB        =  ABh.

                                 h
                             Choose an h-half-line [BX) so that

                 B   B                    hABX = hABC.
C                   ASA,
                          According to Exercise 11.5, (BX)h (BC)h.
C                             By Pasch's theorem (3.12), (BX)h inter-
    According to
                          sects [AC]h. Suppose that C denotes the point
                          of intersection.
                          hABC = hABC; in particular,

                    defect(hABC) = defect(hABC).

  Applying Exercise 11.11 twice, we get that

     defect(hABC) = defect(hABC)+

                          + defect(hBCC) + defect(hBCB).

By Theorem 13.7, all the defects have to be positive. Therefore
                      defect(hABC) > defect(hABC).

On the other hand,

      defect(hABC) = |hABC| + |hBCA| + |hCAB| =
                               = |hABC| + |hBCA| + |hCAB| =
                               = defect(hABC)

   a contradiction.

    Recall that a bijection from an h-plane to itself is called angle preserv-
ing if

                                  hABC = hABC
                                                                                           107

for any hABC and its image hABC.
13.9. Exercise. Show that any angle-preserving transformation of the
h-plane is a motion.

Conformal interpretation

Let us give another interpretation of the h-distance.

13.10. Lemma. Consider the h-plane with the unit circle centered at O
as the absolute. Fix a point P and let Q be another point in the h-plane.
Set x = P Q and y = P Qh. Then

                                      lim y =             2
                                                               2.
                                      x0 x 1 - OP

The above formula tells us that the h-distance from P to a nearby point

Q is almost proportional to the Euclidean distance with the coefficient

1-OP 2 2 .  The value (P ) =                 2       is called the conformal factor        of the
                                         1-OP 2
h-metric.

The         value    1   =  1  ·  (1  -  O  P  2  )  can  be  interpreted  as  the  speed  limit  at
                   (P )     2

the given point P . In this case, the h-distance is the minimal time needed

to travel from one point of the h-plane to another point.

Proof. If P = O, then by Lemma 12.8

 y = ln 1-x 1+x   2
                   x        x

as x  0.                                                                   O PZ
    If P = O, let Z denotes the inverse of P
                                                                                       Q
in the absolute. Suppose that  denotes the                                    Q
circle with the center Z perpendicular to the

absolute.

According to the main observation (12.7)

and Lemma 12.6, the inversion in  is a motion of the h-plane which
sends P to O. In particular, if Q denotes the inverse of Q in , then
OQh = P Qh.

    Set x = OQ. According to Lemma 10.2,

                                               x = OZ .
                                               x ZQ

Since Z is the inverse of P in the absolute, we have that P O·OZ = 1.

13.11. Proposition. The circumference of an h-circle of the h-radius r
is

                                          2·· sh r,

where sh r denotes the hyperbolic sine of r; that is,

                                             sh r := er - e-r .
                                                           2

Before we proceed with the proof, let us discuss the same problem in

the Euclidean plane.

The circumference of a circle in the Euclidean plane can be defined as

the limit of perimeters of regular n-gons inscribed in the circle as n  .

Namely, let us fix r > 0. Given a positive integer n, consider AOB

such  that  AOB    =        2·    and        OA     = OB  = r.   Set  xn  = AB.  Note  that  xn
                             n
is the side of a regular n-gon inscribed in the circle of radius r. Therefore,

the perimeter of the n-gon is n·xn.

                                                      The circumference of the circle with

                                  B the radius r might be defined as the limit

                                                                lim n·xn = 2··r.

                   2·                             (This limit can be taken as the definition
                                             A of .)
                         n  rrrr
                                                       In the following proof, we repeat the
            O                                     same construction in the h-plane.

                                           Proof. Without loss of generality, we can
                                           assume that the center O of the circle is
                                           the center of the absolute.

                                                By Lemma 12.8, the h-circle with the
h-radius r is the Euclidean circle with the center O and the radius

                                              er - 1
                                        a= r .

                                              e +1

    Let xn and yn denote the side lengths of the regular n-gons inscribed
in the circle in the Euclidean and hyperbolic plane respectively.
                                           109

  Note that xn  0 as n  . By Lemma 13.10,

         lim yn =  2
                      2.
         n xn 1 - a

    Applying , we get that the circumference of the h-circle can be found
the following way:

      lim n·yn = 2 2 · lim n·xn =
      n     1 - a n

         =  4··a   2=

            1-a

         =  4· · er +1 er-1  2=

            1 - er +1 er -1

         = 2·· er - e-r =
                      2

         = 2·· sh r.

13.12. Exercise. Let circumh(r) denote the circumference of the h-circle
of the h-radius r. Show that

                           circumh(r + 1) > 2· circumh(r)

for all r > 0.

Pythagorean theorem

Recall that ch denotes hyperbolic cosine; that is, the function defined by
                                      ch x := 2 ex+e-x .

13.13. Hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem. Assume that ACB is an
h-triangle with right angle at C. Set

      a = BCh, b = CAh and c = ABh.

Then

         ch c = ch a· ch b.

    The formula  will be proved by means of direct calculations. Before
giving the proof, let us discuss the limit cases of this formula.
110            CHAPTER 13. GEOMETRY OF THE H-PLANE

Note that ch x can be written using the Taylor expansion

               ch  x  =    1  +   1  ·x2  +   1   ·x4    +  .  .  .  .
                                  2           24

It follows that if a, b, and c are small, then

            1  +  1  ·c2      ch  c  =    ch  a·  ch  b  
                  2

                              (1  +  1    ·a2)·(1  +     1  ·b2)        
                                     2                   2

                              1  +   1  ·(a2  +   b2).
                                     2

In other words, the original Pythagorean theorem (6.4) is a limit case of

the hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem for small triangles.
    For large a and b the terms e-a, e-b, and e-a-b+ln 2 are neglectable.

In this case, we have the following approximations:

                  ch a· ch b  2ea · 2eb =
                              = ea+b-ln 2 
                                      2
                               ch(a + b - ln 2).

Therefore c  a + b - ln 2.

13.14. Exercise. Assume that ACB is an h-triangle with right angle
at C. Set a = BCh, b = CAh, and c = ABh. Show that

                           c + ln 2 > a + b.

      A                           In the proof of the hyperbolic Pythago-
     A                        rean theorem, we use the following formula
                              from Exercise 12.24:

                                     ch ABh =            AB ·AB + AB ·AB          ,

                      B                                                 AA ·BB  

     C   B

                              here A, B are h-points distinct from the
                              center of absolute and A, B are their in-

                              versions in the absolute. This formula is

                              derived in the hints.

Proof of 13.13. We assume that absolute is a unit circle. By the main
observation (12.7) we can assume that C is the center of absolute. Let A
and B denote the inverses of A and B in the absolute.

    Set x = BC, y = AC. By Lemma 12.8

         a = ln 1+x 1-x ,                             b = ln 1-y 1+y .
                                                                               111

Therefore

  ch a = 12 ·( 1+x 1-x + 1-x 1+x ) =       ch b = 21 ·( 1-y 1+y + 1+y 1-y ) =

                   1 + x2                         1 + y2

             =     1-x   2,                   =   1-y      2.

  Note that

           BC = 1x ,                          AC = 1y .

Therefore

           BB      =  1  - x,                 AA  =  1     - y.
                      x                              y

Since the triangles ABC, ABC, ABC, ABC are right, the original
Pythagorean theorem (6.4) implies

           AB =          x2 + y2,             AB =         1x2 + y2,
           AB =          x2 + 1y2 ,           AB =         x2 1 + y2 1 .

  According to Exercise 12.24,

           ch c =  AB ·AB + AB ·AB         =

                           AA ·BB    

                         x2 + y2 · 1x2 + 1y2 + 1x2 + y2 ·  x2 + 1y2
                  = ( y1 - y)·( x1 - x)                               =


                   x2 + y2 + 1 + x2 ·y2
             =                         2=
                   (1 - y )·(1 - x )2

                   1 + x2 1 + y2
             =           2·       2.

Affine geometry

Affine transformations

Affine geometry studies the so-called incidence structure of the Euclidean
plane. The incidence structure sees only which points lie on which lines
and nothing else; it does not directly see distances, angle measures, and
many other things.

    A bijection from the Euclidean plane to itself is called affine transfor-
mation if it maps lines to lines; that is, the image of any line is a line. So
we can say that affine geometry studies the properties of the Euclidean
plane preserved under affine transformations.
14.1. Exercise. Show that an affine transformation of the Euclidean
plane sends any pair of parallel lines to a pair of parallel lines.

    The observation below follows since the lines are defined using the
metric only.
14.2. Observation. Any motion of the Euclidean plane is an affine
transformation.

    The following exercise provides more general examples of affine trans-
formations.
14.3. Exercise. The following maps of a coordinate plane to itself are
affine transformations:

  (a) Shear map defined by (x, y)  (x + k·y, y) for a constant k.
  (b) Scaling defined by (x, y)  (a·x, a·y) for a constant a = 0.
  (c) x-scaling and y-scaling defined respectively by

                        (x, y)  (a·x, y), and (x, y)  (x, a·y)

       for a constant a = 0.

                                             112
                                                                        113

(d) A transformation defined by

                (x, y)  (a·x + b·y + r, c·x + d·y + s)

for  constants  a, b, c, d, r, z  such  that  the  matrix  (a   b)  is  invertible.

                                                             c  d

    From the fundamental theorem of affine geometry (14.11), it will follow
that any affine transformation can be written in the form (d).

    Recall that points are collinear if they lie on one line.

14.4. Exercise. Suppose P  P  is a bijection of the Euclidean plane
that maps collinear triples of points to collinear triples. Show that P  P 

maps noncollinear triples to noncollinear.
    Conclude that P  P  is an affine transformation.

Constructions

Let us consider geometric constructions with a ruler and a parallel tool ;
the latter makes it possible to draw a line thru a given point parallel to
a given line. By Exercisers 14.1, any construction with these two tools
is invariant with respect to affine transformations. For example, to solve
the following exercise, it is sufficient to prove that the midpoint of a given
segment can be constructed with a ruler and a parallel tool.

14.5. Exercise. Let M be the midpoint of segment [AB] in the Eu-
clidean plane. Assume that an affine transformation sends the points A,
B, and M to A, B, and M  respectively. Show that M  is the midpoint
of [AB].

    The following exercise will be used in the proof of Proposition 14.10.

14.6. Exercise. Assume that points with coordinates (0, 0), (1, 0), (a, 0),
and (b, 0) are given. Using a ruler and a parallel tool, construct points
with coordinates (a·b, 0) and (a + b, 0).

14.7. Exercise. Use ruler and parallel tool to construct the center of a
given circle.

    Note that the shear map (described in 14.3a) can change angles be-
tween lines almost arbitrarily. This observation can be used to prove the
impossibility of some constructions; here is one example:

14.8. Exercise. Show that with a ruler and a parallel tool one cannot
construct a line perpendicular to a given line.

Fundamental theorem of affine geometry

Further we assume knowledge of vector algebra; namely, multiplication
by a real number, addition, and the parallelogram rule.

14.9. Exercise. Show that affine transformations map parallelograms

to parallelograms. Conclude that if P  P  is an affine transformation,

then -- --                                   ---  ---
              XY = AB, if and only if X Y = A B .

14.10. Proposition. Let P  P  be an affine transformation of the
Euclidean plane. Then, for any triple of points O, X, P , we have

              -- --                          --- ---
              OP = t·OX if and only if O P = t·O X .

Proof. Observe that the affine transformations described in Exercise 14.3,

as well as all motions, satisfy the condition . Therefore a given affine

transformation P  P  satisfies  if and only if its composition with

motions and scalings satisfies .

  Applying this observation, we can reduce the problem to its partial

case. Namely, we may assume that O = O, X = X, the point O is the

origin of a coordinate system, and X has coordinates (1, 0).
                     -- --

    In this case, OP = t·OX if and only if P = (t, 0). Since O and X are

fixed, the transformation maps the x-axis to itself. That is, P  = (f (t), 0)
                                             ---  ---
for some function t  f (t), or, equivalently, O P = f (t)·O X . It remains

to show that

                                  f (t) = t

for any t.
    Since O = O and X = X, we get that f (0) = 0 and f (1) = 1.

Further, according to Exercise 14.6, we have that f (x·y) = f (x)·f (y) and
f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) for any x, y  R. By the algebraic lemma (proved

below, see 14.14), these conditions imply .

14.11. Fundamental theorem of affine geometry. Suppose an affine
transformation maps a nondegenerate triangle OXY to a triangle OXY .
Then OXY  is nondegenerate, and

     -- -- --                                ---  ---  ---
     OP = x·OX + y·OY if and only if O P = x·O X + y·O Y .

Proof. Since an affine transformation maps lines to lines, the triangle
OXY  is nondegenerate.
                                                                                     115

    If x = 0 or y = 0, then the second statement follows directly from the
proposition. Otherwise, consider points V and W defined by

                            -- -- -- --
                            OV = x·OX, OW = y·OY .

By the proposition,

                ---               ---         --- ---
                O V = x·O X ,                 O W = y·O Y .

     Note that

                -- -- --                                            W                P
                OP = OV + OW ,

or, equivalently, OV P W is a parallelogram. Ac- Y

cording to Exercise 14.1, OV P W  is a paral-

lelogram as well. Therefore                                     O       XV

14.12. Exercise. Show that any affine transformation is continuous.

    The following exercise provides the converse to Exercise 14.3d.

14.13. Exercise. Show that any affine transformation can be written in
coordinates as

                (x, y)  (a·x + b·y + r, c·x + d·y + s)

for  constants  a, b, c, d, r, s  such  that  the  matrix  (a   b)  is  invertible.

Algebraic lemma

The following lemma was used in the proof of Proposition 14.10.

14.14. Lemma. Assume f : R  R is a function such that for any
x, y  R we have

  (a) f (1) = 1,
  (b) f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y),
  (c) f (x·y) = f (x)·f (y).

    Then f is the identity function; that is, f (x) = x for any x  R.

    Note that we do not assume that f is continuous.
    A function f satisfying these three conditions is called a field auto-
morphism. Therefore, the lemma states that the identity function is the
116                                CHAPTER 14. AFFINE GEOMETRY

only automorphism of the field of real numbers. For the field of complex
numbers, the conjugation z  z¯ (see page 144) gives an example of a
nontrivial automorphism.

Proof. By (b) we have

            f (0) + f (1) = f (0 + 1).

By (a),                       f (0) + 1 = 1;
whence

                                   f (0) = 0.

  Applying (b) again, we get that

            0 = f (0) = f (x) + f (-x).

Therefore,

            f (-x) = -f (x) for any x  R.

  Applying (b) recurrently, we get that

            f (2) = f (1) + f (1) = 1 + 1 = 2;
            f (3) = f (2) + f (1) = 2 + 1 = 3;

                  ...

Together with , the latter implies that

            f (n) = n for any integer n.

    By (c)  f                 (m)  =  f  (  m  )·f  (n).
Therefore                                   n

 f ( mn ) = mn

for any rational number mn .                              
Assume a Therefore, [f ( 0. Then t a)]2 = f (he equa a)·f (tion x·x = a has a real solution x = a. a) = f (a). Hence f (a) 0. That is,

            a 0 = f (a) 0.

  Applying , we also get

            a 0 = f (a) 0.
                                                                        117

   Now assume f (a) = a for some a  R. Then there is a rational number

m  that  lies  between  a  and   f (a);  that  is,   the   numbers
n

                        x  =  a  -  m     and     y  =     f (a)  -  m
                                    n                                n

have opposite signs.
    By ,

                              y  +  m  =  f (a)   =
                                    n

                                       = f (x + mn ) =

                                       =  f  (x)  +  f  (  m  )  =
                                                           n

                                       = f (x) + mn ;

that is, f (x) = y. By  and  the values x and y cannot have opposite
signs a contradiction.

On inversive transformations

Recall that the inversive plane is the Euclidean plane with an added point
at infinity, denoted by . We assume that every line passes thru .
Recall that the term circline stands for circle or line.

    An inversive transformation is a bijection from the inversive plane
to itself that sends circlines to circlines. Inversive geometry studies the
circline incidence structure of the inversive plane (it sees which points lie
on which circlines and nothing else).

14.15. Theorem. A map from the inversive plane to itself is an inver-
sive transformation if and only if it can be presented as a composition of
inversions and reflections.

    Exercise 18.16 gives another description of inversive transformations
by means of complex coordinates.

Proof. Evidently, reflection is an inversive transformation it maps lines
to lines and circles to circles. According to Theorem 10.7, any inversion
is an inversive transformation as well. Therefore, the same holds for any
composition of inversions and reflections.

    To prove the converse, fix an inversive transformation .
    Assume () = . Recall that any circline passing thru  is a line.
If follows that  maps lines to lines; that is,  is an affine transformation
that also maps circles to circles.
    Note that any motion or scaling (defined in Exercise 14.3b) are affine
transformations that map circles to circles. Composing  with motions
and scalings, we can obtain another affine transformation  that maps a
118                                   CHAPTER 14. AFFINE GEOMETRY

given unit circle  to itself. By Exercise 14.7,  fixes the center, say O,

of the circle .

     Set P  = (P ). It follows that if OP = 1, then OP  = 1. By

Proposition 14.10, OP = OP  for any point P . Finally, by Exercise 14.9,
                 -- --                ---  ---
                                                                                     
we have that if XY = OP , then X Y = O P . It follows that XY = X Y

for any points X and Y ; that is,  is a motion.

     Summarizing the discussion above,  is a composition of motions and

scalings. Observe that any scaling is a composition of two inversions in

concentric circles. Recall that any motion is a composition of reflections

(see Exercise 5.8). Whence  is a composition of inversions and reflections.

     In the remaining case () = , set P = (). Consider an inver-

sion  in a circle with center P and set  =   . Note that (P ) = ;

therefore, () = . Since  and  are inversive, so is . From above

we get that  is a composition of reflections and inversions. Since  is

self-inverse, we get  =   ; therefore  is a composition of reflections

and inversions as well.

14.16. Exercise. Show that inversive transformations preserve the angle

between arcs up to sign.

     More   precisely,  assume  AB1 C1 ,  AB C        are  the   images  of  two  arcs

AB1C1, AB2C2 under an inversive transformation. Let  and  denote

the angle between the tangent half-lines to AB1C1 and AB2C2 at A and

respectively. Then

                                       = ±.

14.17. Exercise. Show that any reflection can be presented as a com-
position of three inversions.

    The exercise above implies a stronger version of Theorem 14.15; namely,
any inversive transformation is a composition of inversions no reflec-
tions needed.

Projective geometry

Projective completion

In the Euclidean plane, two distinct lines might have one or zero points
of intersection (in the latter case the lines are parallel). Our aim is to
extend the Euclidean plane by ideal points so that any two distinct lines
will have exactly one point of intersection.

    A collection of lines in the Euclidean plane is
called concurrent if they all intersect at a single
point or all of them pairwise parallel. A maximal
set of concurrent lines in the plane is called a pen-
cil. There are two types of pencils: central pencils
contain all lines passing thru a fixed point called
the center of the pencil and parallel pencils con-
tain pairwise parallel lines.

    Each point in the Euclidean plane uniquely de-
fines a central pencil with the center in it. Note
that any two lines completely determine the pencil
containing both.

    Let us add one ideal point for each parallel pen-
cil, and assume that all these ideal points lie on one
ideal line. We also assume that the ideal line be-
longs to each parallel pencil.

    We obtain the so-called real projective plane
(or projective completion of the original plane). It
comes with an incidence structure we say that three points lie on one
line if the corresponding pencils contain a common line. Projective ge-
ometry studies this incidence structure.

    Let us describe points of projective completion in coordinates. A par-

                                             119
120  CHAPTER 15. PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY

allel pencil contains the ideal line and the lines y = m·x + b with fixed
slope m; if m = , we assume that the lines are given by equations
x = a. Therefore the real projective plane contains every point (x, y) in
the coordinate plane plus the ideal line containing one ideal point Pm for
every slope m  R  {}.

Euclidean space

Let us repeat the construction of metric d2 (page 11) in space.
    Suppose that R3 denotes the set of all triples (x, y, z) of real numbers.

Assume A = (xA, yA, zA) and B = (xB, yB, zB) are arbitrary points in
R3. Define the metric on R3 the following way:

               AB := (xA - xB)2 + (yA - yB)2 + (zA - zB)2.

The obtained metric space is called Euclidean space.
    The subset of points in R3 is called plane if it can be described by an

equation
                                a·x + b·y + c·z + d = 0

for some constants a, b, c, and d such that at least one of the values a, b
or c is distinct from zero.

    It is straightforward to show the following:
     Any plane in the Euclidean space is isometric to the Euclidean plane.
     Any three points in the space lie on a plane.
     An intersection of two distinct planes (if it is nonempty) is a line in

       each of these planes.
    These statements make it possible to generalize many notions and
results from Euclidean plane geometry to the Euclidean space by applying
plane geometry in the planes of the space.

Space model

Let us identify the Euclidean plane with a plane  in the Euclidean space
R3 that does not pass thru the origin O. Denote by ^ the projective
completion of .

    Denote by  the set of all lines in the space thru O. Let us define
a bijection P  P between ^ and . If P  , then take the line
P = (OP ); if P is an ideal point of ^ , so it is defined by a parallel pencil
of lines, then take the line P thru O parallel to the lines in this pencil.

    Further, denote by  the set of all planes in the space thru O. In a
similar fashion, we can define a bijection    between lines in ^ and
. If a line  is not ideal, then take the plane  that contains  and O; if
                                                                                           121

the line  is ideal, then take  to be the plane thru O that is parallel to 
(that is,    = ).
15.1. Observation. Let P and  be a point and a line in the real pro-
jective plane. Then P   if and only if P  , where P and  denote the
line and plane defined by the constructed bijections.

Perspective projection

Consider two planes  and  in the Euclidean space. Let O be a point
that belongs neither to  nor .

  A perspective projection from  to 

with center O maps a point P   to the 
intersection point P  =   (OP ).                       

  In general, perspective projection is not

a bijection between the planes. Indeed, if               O

the line (OP ) is parallel to  (that is, if

(OP )   = ) then the perspective pro-

jection of P   is undefined. Also, if
(OP )  for P   , then the point P  is not an image of the per-

spective projection.

    For example, suppose O is the origin of (x, y, z)-coordinate space, and
the planes  and  are given by the equations z = 1 and x = 1 respec-
tively. Then the perspective projection from  to  can be written in

the coordinates as

                      (x,  y,  1)    (1,  y  ,  1  ).
                                          x     x

Indeed the coordinates have to be proportional; points on  have unit
z-coordinate, and points on  have unit z-coordinate.

    The perspective projection maps one plane to another. However, we
can identify the two planes by fixing a coordinate system in each. In this
case, we get a partially defined map from the plane to itself. We will keep
the name perspective transformation for such maps.

    For the described perspective projection; we may get the map

                       : (x, y)  ( 1x , xy ).

This map is undefined on the line x = 0. Also, points on this line are not

images of points under perspective projection.
    Denote by ^ and ^  the projective completions of  and  respec-

tively. Note that the perspective projection is a restriction of composition
of the two bijections ^    ^  constructed in the previous section.
122                     CHAPTER 15. PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY

By Observation 15.1, the perspective projection can be extended to a
bijection ^  ^  that sends lines to lines.1

    For example, to define an extension of the perspective projection  in
, we have to observe that

     The pencil of vertical lines x = a is mapped to itself.
     The ideal points defined by pencils of lines y = m·x + b are mapped

       to the point (0, m) and the other way around point (0, m) is
       mapped to the ideal point defined by the pencil of lines y = m·x+ b.

Projective transformations

A bijection from the real projective plane to itself that sends lines to lines
is called projective transformation.

    Note that any affine transformation defines a projective transforma-
tion on the corresponding real projective plane. We will call such pro-
jective transformations affine; these are projective transformations that
send the ideal line to itself.

    The extended perspective projection discussed in the previous section
provides another source of examples of projective transformations.

15.2. Theorem. Given a line  in the real projective plane, there is a

perspective projection that sends  to the ideal line.

Moreover, a perspective transformation is either affine or, in a suitable

coordinate system, it can be written as a composition of the extension of

perspective projection

                          :    (x,  y)    ( xy ,  1  )
                                                  y

and an affine transformation.

Proof. We may choose an (x, y)-coordinate system such that the line 
is defined by equation y = 0. Then the extension of  gives the needed
transformation.

    Fix a projective transformation . If  sends the ideal line to itself,
then it has to be affine. It proves the theorem in this case.

    Suppose  sends the ideal line to a line . Choose a perspective pro-
jection  as above. The composition    sends the ideal line to itself.
That is,  =    is affine. Note that  is self-inverse; therefore  =   

   hence the result.

    1A similar story happened with inversion. An inversion is not defined at its center;
moreover, the center is not an inverse of any point. To deal with this problem we
passed to the inversive plane which is the Euclidean plane extended by one ideal point.
The same strategy worked for perspective projection   , but this time we need
to add an ideal line.
                                                                                           123

15.3. Exercise. Let P  P  be (a) an affine transformation, (b) the
perspective projection defined by (x, y)  ( xy , 1y ), or (c) arbitrary projec-
tive transformation. Suppose P1, P2, P3, P4 lie on one line. Show that

                               P1P2 ·P3P4 P1P2 ·P3P4
                                              =    ;

                               P2P3 ·P4P1 P2P3 ·P4P1
that is, each of these maps preserves cross-ratio for quadruples of points
on one line.

Moving points to infinity

Theorem 15.2 makes it possible to take any                      Z
line in the projective plane and declare it to
be ideal. In other words, we can choose a pre-                        AAAA
ferred affine plane by removing one line from
the projective plane. This construction pro-                 A
vides a method for solving problems in projec-
tive geometry which will be illustrated by the  O                           BBBB
following classical example:                        BBBB

15.4. Desargues' theorem. Consider three                     C
concurrent lines (AA), (BB), and (CC) in                          X CCCC
the real projective plane. Set
                                                                Y
                 X = (BC)  (BC),
                 Y = (CA)  (CA),
                 Z = (AB)  (AB).

Then the points X, Y , and Z are collinear.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the line (XY ) is

ideal. If not, apply a perspective projection that sends the line (XY ) to

the ideal line.                                                       AAAA

That is, we can assume that

                                                          A

    (BC) (BC) and (CA) (CA)                     O               BBBB
and we need to show that                            BBBB

                                                          C

                 (AB) (AB).                                                 CCCC

    Assume that the lines (AA), (BB), and (CC) intersect at point O.
Since (BC) (BC), the transversal property (7.9) implies that OBC =
= OBC and OCB = OCB. By the AA similarity condition,
124         CHAPTER 15. PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY

OBC  OBC. In particular,

                                   OB OC
                                          = .

                                   OB OC
In the same way, we get that OAC  OAC and

            OA OC
                  = .

            OA OC

Therefore,  OA OB
                  = .

            OA OB

By the SAS similarity condition, we get that OAB  OAB; in
particular, OAB = ±OAB.

    Note that AOB = AOB. Therefore,

            OAB = OAB.

By the transversal property (7.9), we have (AB) (AB).
    The case (AA) (BB) (CC) is done similarly. In this case, the

quadrangles BBCC and AACC are parallelograms. Therefore,

            BB = CC = AA.

Hence BBAA is a parallelogram and (AB) (AB).

    Here is another classical theorem of projective geometry.

15.5. Pappus' theorem. Assume that two triples of points A, B, C,
and A, B, C are collinear. Suppose that points X, Y , Z are uniquely
defined by

X = (BC)  (BC), Y = (CA)  (CA), Z = (AB)  (AB).

Then the points X, Y , Z are collinear.

    Pappus' theorem can be proved the same way as Desargues' theorem.

Idea of the proof. Applying a perspective projection, we can assume that
Y and Z lie on the ideal line. It remains to show that X lies on the ideal
line.

    In other words, assuming that (AB) (AB) and (AC) (AC), we
need to show that (BC) (BC).

scribed above.                              A                C

15.10. Exercise. Show that the Euclidean       q                m
plane does not admit a duality.

15.11. Theorem. The real projective plane admits a duality.

Proof. Consider a plane  and a point O /  in the space; suppose that
^ denotes the corresponding real projective plane.

    Recall that  and  denote the set of all lines and planes passing thru
O. According to Observation 15.1, there are bijections P  P between
points of ^ and  and    between lines in ^ and  such that P   if
and only if P  .

    It remains to construct a bijection   L between  and  such that

     P    p  L

for any two lines P and L passing thru O.
    Set  to be the plane thru O that is perpendicular to L . Note that

both conditions  are equivalent to P  L ; hence the result follows.

15.12. Exercise. Consider the Euclidean plane with (x, y)-coordinates;
suppose that O denotes the origin. Given a point P = O with coordinates
(a, b) consider the line p given by the equation a·x + b·y = 1.

    Show that the correspondence P to p extends to a duality of the real
projective plane.

    Which line corresponds to O?
    Which point corresponds to the line a·x + b·y = 0?

    Duality says that lines and points have the same rights in terms of
incidence. It makes it possible to formulate an equivalent dual statement

    2The standard definition of duality is more general; we consider a special case which
is also called polarity.

to any statement in projective geometry. For example, the dual statement
for "the points X, Y , and Z lie on one line " would be the "lines x, y,
and z intersect at one point L". Let us formulate the dual statement for
Desargues' theorem 15.4.
15.13. Dual Desargues' theorem. Consider the collinear points X,
Y , and Z. Assume that

    X = (BC)  (BC), Y = (CA)  (CA), Z = (AB)  (AB).

Then the lines (AA), (BB), and (CC) are concurrent.
    In this theorem, the points X, Y , and Z are dual to the lines (AA),

(BB), and (CC) in the original formulation, and the other way around.
    Once Desargues' theorem is proved, applying duality (15.11) we get

the dual Desargues' theorem. Note that the dual Desargues' theorem is
the converse to the original Desargues' theorem 15.4.
15.14. Exercise. Formulate the dual Pappus' theorem (see 15.5).

15.15. Exercise. Solve the following construction problem
  (a) using dual Desargues' theorem;
  (b) using Pappus' theorem or its dual.

Problem. Given two parallel lines, construct a third parallel line thru a
given point with a ruler only.

Construction of a polar

In this section, we describe a powerful trick that can be used in the con-
structions with ruler.

    Assume  is a circle in the plane and P / . Draw two lines x and

                                     Z

                              XXXX

y thru P that intersect  at two pairs of points X, X and Y , Y . Let
Z = (XY )(XY ) and Z = (XY )(XY ). Consider the line p = (ZZ).

15.16. Claim. The constructed line p = (ZZ) does not depend on the
choice of the lines x and y.

    Moreover, P  p can be extended to a duality such that any point P
on the circle  corresponds to a line p tangent to  at P .

    We will not prove this claim, but the proof is not hard. If P lies
outside of , it can be done by moving P to infinity keeping  fixed as
a set. If P lies inside of , it can be done by moving P to the center
of . The existence of corresponding projective transformations follows
from the idea in Exercise 16.6.

    The line p is called the polar of the point P with respect to .
    The point P is called the pole of the line p with respect to .

15.17. Exercise. Revert the described construction. That is, given a
circle  and a line p that is not tangent to , construct a point P such
that the described construction for P and  produces the line p.

15.18. Exercise. Let p be the polar line of point P with respect to the
circle . Assume that p intersects  at points V and W . Show that the
lines (P V ) and (P W ) are tangent to .

    Come up with a ruler-only construction of the tangent lines to the
given circle  thru the given point P / .

15.19. Exercise. Assume two concentric circles  and  are given.
Construct the common center of  and  with a ruler only.

15.20. Exercise. Assume a line  and a circle  with its center O are
given. Suppose O / . Construct a perpendicular from O on  with a
ruler only.

Axioms

Note that the real projective plane described above satisfies the following
set of axioms:

  p-I. Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.
 p-II. Any two distinct lines pass thru a unique point.
p-III. There exist at least four points of which no three are collinear.

    Let us take these three axioms as a definition of the projective plane; so
the real projective plane discussed above becomes its particular example.
                                                                                           129

    There is an example of a projective plane that con-
tains exactly 3 points on each line. This is the so-called
Fano plane which you can see on the diagram; it con-
tains 7 points and 7 lines. This is an example of a
finite projective plane; that is, a projective plane with
finitely many points.

15.21. Exercise. Show that any line in a projective plane contains at
least three points.

    Consider the following dual analog of Axiom p-III:

  p-III. There exist at least four lines of which no three are concurrent.

15.22. Exercise. Show that Axiom p-III is equivalent to Axiom p-III.
That is,

                           p-I, p-II, and p-III imply p-III,

and

                           p-I, p-II, and p-III imply p-III.

    The exercise above shows that in the given axiomatic system, lines and
points have the same rights. One can switch everywhere words "point"
with "line", "pass thru" with "lies on", "collinear" with "concurrent" and we
get an equivalent set of axioms Axioms p-I and p-II convert into each
other, and the same happens with the pair p-III and p-III.

15.23. Exercise. Assume that one of the lines in a finite projective
plane contains exactly n + 1 points.

  (a) Show that each line contains exactly n + 1 points.
  (b) Show that the plane contains exactly n2 + n + 1 points.
  (c) Show that there is no projective plane with exactly 10 points.
  (d) Show that in any finite projective plane the number of points coin-

       cides with the number of lines.

    The number n in the above exercise is called order of finite projective
plane. For example, the Fano plane has order 2. Let us finish by stating
a famous open problem in finite geometry.

15.24. Conjecture. The order of any finite projective plane is a power
of a prime number.
Chapter 16

Spherical geometry

Spherical geometry studies the surface of a unit sphere. This geometry
has applications in cartography, navigation, and astronomy.

    The spherical geometry is a close relative of the Euclidean and hy-
perbolic geometries. Most of the theorems of hyperbolic geometry have
spherical analogs, but spherical geometry is easier to visualize.

Euclidean space

Recall that Euclidean space is the set R3 of all triples (x, y, z) of real
numbers such that the distance between a pair of points A = (xA, yA, zA)
and B = (xB, yB, zB) is defined by the following formula:

               AB := (xA - xB)2 + (yA - yB)2 + (zA - zB)2.

    The planes in the space are defined as the set of solutions of

                                a·x + b·y + c·z + d = 0

for real numbers a, b, c, and d such that at least one of the numbers a,
b or c is not zero. Any plane in the Euclidean space is isometric to the
Euclidean plane.

    A sphere in space is the direct analog of a circle in the plane. Formally,
sphere with center O and radius r is the set of points in the space that
lie at the distance r from O.

    Let A and B be two points on the unit sphere centered at O. The
spherical distance from A to B (briefly ABs) is defined as |AOB|.

    In spherical geometry, the role of lines play the great circles; that is,
the intersection of the sphere with a plane passing thru O.

                                             130
                                                                          131

    Note that the great circles do not form lines in the sense of Defini-
tion 1.9. Also, any two distinct great circles intersect at two antipodal
points. In particular, the sphere does not satisfy the axioms of the neutral
plane.

Pythagorean theorem

Here is an analog of the Pythagorean theorems (6.4 and 13.13) in spherical
geometry.

16.1. Spherical Pythagorean Theorem. Let sABC be a spherical
triangle with a right angle at C. Set a = BCs, b = CAs, and c = ABs.
Then

                                   cos c = cos a· cos b.

    In the proof, we will use the notion of the scalar product which we are

about to discuss.

    Let vA = (xA, yA, zA) and vB = (xB, yB, zB) denote the position
vectors of points A and B. The scalar product of the two vectors vA and
vB in R3 is defined as

               vA, vB := xA ·xB + yA ·yB + zA ·zB.

    Assume both vectors vA and vB are nonzero; suppose that  denotes
the angle measure between them. Then the scalar product can be ex-
pressed the following way:

                       vA, vB = |vA|·|vB |· cos ,

where

       |vA| =  x2   +  y2   +  zA2 ,  |vB| =       x2   +  y2   +  zB2 .

                 A       A                           B       B

    Now, assume that the points A and B lie on the unit sphere  in R3
centered at the origin. In this case, |vA| = |vB| = 1. By  we get that

                            cos ABs = vA, vB .

Proof of the spherical Pythagorean Theorem. Since the angle at C is right,
we can choose the coordinates in R3 so that vC = (0, 0, 1), vA lies in the
xz-plane, so vA = (xA, 0, zA), and vB lies in yz-plane, so vB = (0, yB, zB).

    Applying, , we get that

                                 zA = vC , vA = cos b,

                                 zB = vC , vB = cos a.
132  CHAPTER 16. SPHERICAL GEOMETRY

Applying,  and , we get that                   z
                                           CCCC
  cos c = vA, vB =
         = xA ·0 + 0·yB + zA ·zB =                  A
         = cos b· cos a.
                                    B

16.2. Exercise. Show that if sABC is x y
a spherical triangle with a right angle at C,
and ACs = BCs = 4 , then ABs = 3 .

Inversion of the space

The inversion in a sphere is defined the same way as we define the inversion
in a circle.

    Formally, let  be the sphere with the center O and radius r. The
inversion in  of a point P is the point P   [OP ) such that

                                      OP ·OP  = r2.

In this case, the sphere  will be called the sphere of inversion and its
center is called the center of inversion.

    We also add  to the space and assume that the center of inversion
is mapped to  and the other way around. The space R3 with the point
 will be called inversive space.

    The inversion of the space has many properties of the inversion of the
plane. Most important for us are the analogs of theorems 10.6, 10.7, 10.25
which can be summarized as follows:

16.3. Theorem. The inversion in the sphere has the following proper-
ties:

  (a) Inversion maps a sphere or a plane into a sphere or a plane.
  (b) Inversion maps a circle or a line into a circle or a line.
  (c) Inversion preserves the cross-ratio; that is, if A, B, C, and D

       are the inverses of the points A, B, C and D respectively, then

                                    AB ·CD AB ·CD
                                    BC ·DA = BC ·DA .

  (d) Inversion maps arcs into arcs.
  (e) Inversion preserves the absolute value of the angle measure between

       tangent half-lines to the arcs.
                                                                                           133

    We do not present the proofs here, but they nearly repeat the corre-
sponding proofs in plane geometry. To prove (a), you will need in addition
the following lemma; its proof is left to the reader.

16.4. Lemma. Let  be a subset of the Euclidean space that contains
at least two points. Fix a point O in the space.

    Then  is a sphere if and only if for any plane  passing thru O, the
intersection    is either empty set, one point set, or a circle.

    The following observation helps to reduce part (b) to part (a).

16.5. Observation. Any circle in the space is an intersection of two
spheres.

    Let us define a circular cone as a set formed by line
segments from a fixed point, called the tip of the cone,
to all the points on a fixed circle, called the base of the
cone; we always assume that the base does not lie in
the same plane as the tip. We say that the cone is right
if the center of the base circle is the foot point of the
tip on the base plane; otherwise, we call it oblique.

16.6. Exercise. Let K be an oblique circular cone. Show that there
is a plane  that is not parallel to the base plane of K such that the
intersection   K is a circle.

Stereographic projection

Consider the unit sphere  centered at                           N

the origin (0, 0, 0). This sphere can be                                        P
described by the equation x2 +y2 +z2 =                          

= 1.

  Suppose that  denotes the xy-

plane; it is defined by the equation z =                        O P

0. Clearly,  runs thru the center of .

    Let N = (0, 0, 1) and S = (0, 0, -1)                  
denote the "north" and "south" poles of                            S
; these are the points on the sphere

that have extremal distances to . Sup-

pose that  denotes the "equator" of ; The plane thru P , O, and S.

it is the intersection   .

  For any point P = S on , consider the line (SP ) in the space. This

line intersects  in exactly one point, denoted by P . Set S = .

  The map s : P  P  is called the stereographic projection from  to

  with  respect  to  the  south  pole.  The  inverse  of  this  map   -1 :  P      P  is

                                                                       s
134                                     CHAPTER 16. SPHERICAL GEOMETRY

called the stereographic projection from  to  with respect to the south

pole.

   In the same way, one can define the stereographic projections n and

-1    with    respect     to  the  north    pole  N.

 n Note that P = P  if and only if P  .

   Note that if  and  are as above, then the composition of the stere-

ographic      projections       s  :           and    -1  :        are  the  restrictions  to

                                                       s

 and  respectively of the inversion in the sphere  with the center S
and radius 2.

   From above and Theorem 16.3, it follows that the stereographic pro-

jection preserves the angles between arcs; more precisely the absolute value

of the angle measure between arcs on the sphere.

   This makes it particularly useful in cartography. A map of a big region

of earth cannot be done on a constant scale, but using a stereographic

projection, one can keep the angles between roads the same as on earth.

   In the following exercises, we assume that , , , , O, S, and N

are as above.

16.7. Exercise.               Show    that  n     -1,  the   composition  of  stereographic

                                                   s

projections from  to  from S, and from  to  from N is the inverse

of the plane  in .

16.8. Exercise. Show that a stereographic projection    sends the
great circles to plane circlines that intersect  at opposite points.

   The following exercise is analogous to Lemma 13.10.

16.9. Exercise. Fix a point P   and let Q be another point in . Let

P  and Q denote their stereographic projections to . Set x = P Q and

y  =  P    Q     .  Show  that
              s

                                        lim y =        2

Central projection

The central projection is analogous to the projective model of hyperbolic
plane which is discussed in Chapter 17.

    Let  be the unit sphere centered at the origin which will be denoted
by O. Suppose that + denotes the plane defined by the equation z = 1.
This plane is parallel to the xy-plane and it passes thru the north pole
N = (0, 0, 1) of .
                                                                   135

Recall that the northern hemisphere of , +        N             P

is the subset of points (x, y, z)   such that

z > 0. The northern hemisphere will be de-                      P

noted by +.                                    +

Given a point P  +, consider the half-            O

line [OP ). Suppose that P  denotes the in-

tersection of [OP ) and +. Note that if
P = (x, y, z), then P  = ( xz , yz , 1). It follows that P  P  is a bijec-
tion between + and +.

The described bijection +  + is called the central projection of

the hemisphere +.

Note that the central projection sends the intersections of the great

circles with + to the lines in +. The latter follows since the great

circles are intersections of  with planes passing thru the origin as well

as the lines in + are the intersection of + with these planes.

The following exercise is analogous to Exercise 17.5 in hyperbolic ge-

ometry.

16.10. Exercise. Let sABC be a nondegenerate spherical triangle.
Assume that the plane + is parallel to the plane passing thru A, B,
and C. Let A, B, and C denote the central projections of A, B and C.

  (a) Show that the midpoints of [AB], [BC], and [CA] are central

       projections of the midpoints of [AB]s, [BC]s, and [CA]s respectively.

  (b) Use part (a) to show that the medians of a spherical triangle inter-

       sect at one point.

Projective model

The projective model is another model of hyperbolic plane discovered by
Beltrami; it is often called Klein model. The projective and conformal
models are saying exactly the same thing but in two different languages.
Some problems in hyperbolic geometry admit simpler proof using the
projective model and others have simpler proof in the conformal model.
Therefore, it is worth knowing both.

Special bijection on the h-plane

Consider the conformal disc model with the absolute at the unit circle 

centered at O. Choose a coordinate system (x, y) on the plane with the

origin at O, so the circle  is described by the equation x2 + y2 = 1.

                              Let us think that our plane is the

                              coordinate xy-plane in the Euclidean

           N              space; denote it by . Let  be the unit
              P  sphere centered at O; it is described by

                          the equation

  OP                                        x2 + y2 + z2 = 1.

              P^              Set S = (0, 0, -1) and N = (0, 0, 1);
                              these are the south and north poles of .
                 S
The plane thru P , O, and S.      Consider stereographic projection
                                 from S; given point P   de-
                              note its image in . Note that the h-
                              plane is mapped to the northern hemi-
                              sphere; that is, to the set of points
                              (x, y, z) in  described by the inequal-
                              ity z > 0.

    For a point P    consider its foot point P^ on ; this is the closest
point to P .

    Note that the composition P  P   P^ of these two maps gives a
bijection from the h-plane to itself. Further, note that P = P^ if and only
if P   or P = O.
17.1. Exercise. Suppose that P  P^ is the bijection described above.
Assume that P is a point of h-plane distinct from the center of absolute
and Q is its inverse in the absolute. Show that the midpoint of [P Q] is
the inversion of P^ in the absolute.

17.2. Lemma. Let (P Q)h be an h-line with the ideal points A and B.
Then P^, Q^  [AB].

    Moreover,

                               AQ^ ·BP^ AQ·BP 2
Q  ^B·P^A = QB·P A .

In particular, if A, P, Q, B appear in the same order, then

                                 P Qh = 21 · ln AQ^ ·BP^ Q^B ·P^A .

Proof. Consider the stereographic projection    from the south
pole S. Note that it fixes A and B; denote by P  and Q the images of P
and Q;

    According to Theorem 16.3c,

                            AQ·BP AQ ·BP 
                            =  .
                            QB·P A Q B·P A

  By Theorem 16.3e, each circline in  that is perpendicular to  is

mapped to a circle in  that is still perpendicular to . It follows that the

stereographic projection sends (P Q)h to the intersection of the northern

hemisphere of  with a plane perpendicular to .
    Suppose that  denotes the plane; it contains the points A, B, P , P^

and the circle  =   . (It also contains Q and Q^ but we will not use

these points for a while.)                     P

138        CHAPTER 17. PROJECTIVE MODEL

    Since [AB] is the diameter of , by Corollary 9.8, the angle AP B is
right. Hence AP^P   AP B  P P^B. In particular

           AP  AP^ P P^
           BP  = P P^ = BP^ .

Therefore  AP^ =              AP  2
           BP^                BP .

In the same way, we get that

    The last statement follows from  and the definition of h-distance.

Projective model

The following picture illustrates the map P  P^ described in the previous
section if you take the picture on the left and apply the map P 
 P^, you get the picture on the right. The pictures are conformal and
projective models of the hyperbolic plane respectively. The map P  P^
is a "translation" from one to another.
                                   139

Conformal model  Projective model

    In the projective model, things look different; some become simpler,
other things become more complicated.

Lines. The h-lines in the projective model are chords of the absolute;
more precisely, chords without its endpoints.

    This observation can be used to transfer statements about lines and
points from the Euclidean plane to the h-plane. As an example let us
state a hyperbolic version of Pappus' theorem for h-plane.

17.4. Hyperbolic Pappus' theorem. Assume that two triples of h-
points A, B, C, and A, B, C in the h-plane are h-collinear. Suppose
that the h-points X, Y , and Z are defined by

X = (BC)h  (BC)h, Y = (CA)h  (CA)h, Z = (AB)h  (AB)h.

Then the points X, Y , Z are h-collinear.

    In the projective model, this statement follows immediately from the
original Pappus' theorem 15.5. The same can be done for Desargues' the-
orem 15.4. The same argument shows that the construction of a tangent
line with a ruler-only described in Exercise15.18 works in the h-plane as
well.

    On the other hand, note that it is not at all easy to prove this statement
using the conformal model.

Circles and equidistants. The h-circles and equidistants in the projec-
tive model are a certain type of ellipses and their open arcs.

    It follows since the stereographic projection sends circles on the plane
to circles on the unit sphere and the foot point projection of the circle
back to the plane is an ellipse. (One may define ellipse as a foot point
projection of a circle.)

Distance. Consider a pair of h-points P and Q. Let A and B be the
ideal points of the h-line in the projective model; that is, A and B are
the intersections of the Euclidean line (P Q) with the absolute.
140                  CHAPTER 17. PROJECTIVE MODEL

Then by Lemma 17.2,

 P Qh = 21 · ln AQ·BP QB ·P A ,

assuming the points A, P, Q, B appear on the line in the same order.

Angles. The angle measures in the projective

model are very different from the Euclidean an- A                     B
gles and it is hard to figure out by looking on
                                                   PQ
the picture. For example, all the intersecting

h-lines on the picture are perpendicular.

There are two useful exceptions:

 If O is the center of the absolute, then

                     hAOB = AOB.

     If O is the center of the absolute and OAB = ± 2 , then

                                   hOAB = OAB = ± 2 .

    To find the angle measure in the projective model, you may apply a
motion of the h-plane that moves the vertex of the angle to the center
of the absolute; once it is done the hyperbolic and Euclidean angles have
the same measure.

Motions. The motions of the h-plane in the conformal and projective
models are relevant to inversive transformations and projective transfor-
mation in the same way. Namely:

     Inversive transformations that preserve the h-plane describe motions
       of the h-plane in the conformal model.

     Projective transformations that preserve h-plane describe motions
       of the h-plane in the projective model.1

    The following exercise is a hyperbolic analog of Exercise 16.10. This
is the first example of a statement that admits an easier proof using the
projective model.

17.5. Exercise. Let P and Q be the points in h-plane that lie at the
same distance from the center of the absolute. Observe that in the projec-
tive model, h-midpoint of [P Q]h coincides with the Euclidean midpoint of
[P Q]h.

    Conclude that if an h-triangle is inscribed in an h-circle, then its me-
dians meet at one point.

    Recall that an h-triangle might be also inscribed in a horocycle or an
equidistant. Think how to prove the statement in this case.

    1The idea described in the solution of Exercise 16.6 and in the sketch of proof of
Theorem 19.13 can be used to construct many projective transformations of this type.
                                                                   141

17.6. Exercise. Let  and m are h-lines in the       m
projective model. Let s and t denote the Eu-                    s
clidean lines tangent to the absolute at the ideal
points of . Show that if the lines s, t, and the           
extension of m intersect at one point, then  and                t
m are perpendicular h-lines.

17.7. Exercise. Use the projective model to derive the formula for angle
of parallelism (Proposition 13.2).

17.8. Exercise. Use the projective model to find the inradius of the ideal
triangle.

    The projective model of h-plane can be used to give another proof of
the hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem (13.13).

    First, let us recall its statement:

  ch c = ch a· ch b,

where a = BCh, b = CAh, and c = ABh and hACB        is an  h-triangle
with a right angle at C.                              A
                                                                X
    Note that we can assume that A is the center            u Bs
of the absolute. Set s = BC, t = CA, u =                   tC
= AB. According to the Euclidean Pythagorean
theorem (6.4), we have

  u2 = s2 + t2.

It remains to express a, b, and c using s, u, and
t and show that  implies . Y

17.9. Advanced exercise. Finish the proof of
hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem (13.13) indicated above.

Bolyai's construction

Assume we need to construct a line thru P asymptotically parallel to the
given line  in the h-plane.

    If A and B are ideal points of  in the projective model, then we could
simply draw the Euclidean line (P A). However, the ideal points do not lie
in the h-plane; therefore there is no way to use them in the construction.

    In the following construction we assume that you know a compass-
and-ruler construction of the perpendicular line; see Exercise 5.22.
142                   CHAPTER 17. PROJECTIVE MODEL

17.10. Bolyai's construction.
   1. Drop a perpendicular from P to ; denote it by m. Let Q be the foot
       point of P on .
   2. Erect a perpendicular from P to m; denote it by n.
   3. Mark by R a point on  distinct from Q.
   4. Drop a perpendicular from R to n; denote it by k.
   5. Draw the circle  with center P and the radius QR. Mark by T a
       point of intersection of  with k.
   6. The line (P T )h is asymptotically parallel to .

17.11. Exercise. Explain what happens if one performs the Bolyai con-
struction in the Euclidean plane.

    To prove that Bolyai's construction gives the asymptotically parallel
line in the h-plane, it is sufficient to show the following:

17.12. Proposition. Assume P , Q, R, S, T are points in h-plane such
that

     S  (RT )h,
     (P Q)h  (QR)h,
     (P S)h  (P Q)h,
     (RT )h  (P S)h and
     (P T )h and (QR)h are asymptotically parallel.
Then QRh = P Th.

Proof. We will use the projective model. Without loss of generality, we
may assume that P is the center of the absolute. As it was noted on page
140, in this case, the corresponding Euclidean lines are also perpendicular;
that is, (P Q)  (QR), (P S)  (P Q), and (RT )  (P S).

    Let A be the common ideal point of (QR)h and (P T )h. Let B and C
denote the remaining ideal points of (QR)h and (P T )h respectively.

    Note that the Euclidean lines (P Q), (T R), and (CB) are parallel.
                                                       Therefore,

Applying the formula for h-distance , we get that QRh = P Th.
Chapter 18

Complex coordinates

In this chapter, we give an interpretation of inversive geometry using
complex coordinates. The results of this chapter lead to a deeper under-
standing of both concepts.

Complex numbers

Informally, a complex number is a number that can be put in the form

                 z = x + i·y,

where x and y are real numbers and i2 = -1.
    The set of complex numbers will be further denoted by C. If x, y, and

z are as in , then x is called the real part and y the imaginary part of
the complex number z. Briefly, it is written as

  x = Re z and y = Im z.

    On the more formal level, a complex number is a pair of real numbers
(x, y) with the addition and multiplication described below; the expression
x + i·y is only a convenient way to write the pair (x, y).

 (x1 + i·y1) + (x2 + i·y2) := (x1 + x2) + i·(y1 + y2);
        (x1 + i·y1)·(x2 + i·y2) := (x1 ·x2 - y1 ·y2) + i·(x1 ·y2 + y1 ·x2).

Complex coordinates

Recall that one can think of the Euclidean plane as the set of all pairs of
real numbers (x, y) equipped with the metric

                         AB = (xA - xB )2 + (yA - yB)2,

                 143
144                       CHAPTER 18. COMPLEX COORDINATES

where A = (xA, yA) and B = (xB, yB).
    One can pack the coordinates (x, y) of a point in one complex number

z = x + i·y. This way we get a one-to-one correspondence between points
of the Euclidean plane and C. Given a point Z = (x, y), the complex
number z = x + i·y is called the complex coordinate of Z.

    Note that if O, E, and I are points in the plane with complex coordi-
nates 0, 1, and i, then EOI = ± 2 . Further, we assume that EOI = 2 ;
if not, one has to change the direction of the y-coordinate.

Conjugation and absolute value

Let z = x + i·y; that is, z is a complex number with real part x and
imaginary part y. If y = 0, we say that the complex number z is real
and if x = 0 we say that z is imaginary. The set of points with real
(imaginary) complex coordinates is a line in the plane, which is called
real (respectively imaginary) line. The real line will be denoted as R.

    The complex number
                                        z¯ := x - i·y

is called the complex conjugate of z = x + i·y. Let Z and Z¯ be the points
in the plane with the complex coordinates z and z¯ respectively. Note that
the point Z¯ is the reflection of Z across the real line.

    It is straightforward to check that

 x = Re z = z + z¯, y = Im z = z - z¯, x2 + y2 = z ·z¯.
                    2                i·2

The  last  formula  in    makes  it  possible  to  express   the  quotient  w  of
                                                                            z
two complex numbers w and z = x + i·y:

                        wz = z ·z¯ 1 ·w·z¯ = x2+y2 1 ·w·z¯.

Note that

     z + w = z¯ + w¯, z - w = z¯ - w¯, z ·w = z¯·w¯, z/w = z¯/w¯.

That is, the complex conjugation respects all the arithmetic operations.
    The value
                                                                        
                |z| := x2 + y2 = (x + i·y)·(x - i·y) = z ·z¯

is called the absolute value of z. If |z| = 1, then z is called a unit complex
number.

18.1. Exercise. Show that |v·w| = |v|·|w| for any v, w  C.
                                                                  145

    Suppose that Z and W are points with complex coordinates z and w.
Note that

                 ZW = |z - w|.

The triangle inequality for the points with complex coordinates 0, v, and
v + w implies that

                                    |v + w| |v| + |w|

for any v, w  C; this inequality is also called triangle inequality.

18.2. Exercise. Use the identity

  u·(v - w) + v·(w - u) + w·(u - v) = 0

for u, v, w  C and the triangle inequality to prove Ptolemy's inequality
(6.8).

Euler's formula

Let  be a real number. The following identity is called Euler's formula:

                 ei· = cos  + i· sin .

In particular, ei· = -1 and ei· 2 = i.          ei· i
    Geometrically, Euler's formula means the                 

following: Assume that O and E are the points   0              1
with complex coordinates 0 and 1 respectively.
Assume

  OZ = 1 and EOZ  ,

then ei· is the complex coordinate of Z. In particular, the complex
coordinate of any point on the unit circle centered at O can be uniquely
expressed as ei· for some   (-, ].

Why should you think that  is true? The proof of Euler's identity
depends on the way you define the exponential function. If you never had
to apply the exponential function to an imaginary number, you may take
the right-hand side in  as the definition of the ei·.

    In this case, formally nothing has to be proved, but it is better to
check that ei· satisfies familiar identities. Mainly,

                 ei· ·ei· = ei·(+).
146                                  CHAPTER 18. COMPLEX COORDINATES

The latter can be proved using  and the following trigonometric formu-
las, which we assume to be known:

                      cos( + ) = cos · cos  - sin · sin ,
                      sin( + ) = sin · cos  + cos · sin .

    If you know the power series for the sine, cosine, and exponential
function, then the following might convince that the identity  holds:

     ei· = 1 + i· + (i·)2 + (i·)3 + (i·)4 + (i·)5 + · · · =
                                     2!  3!          4!            5!

                      = 1 + i· - 2 - i· 3 + 4 + i· 5 - · · · =
                                       2! 3! 4! 5!

                      = 1 - 2 + 4 - · · · + i·  - 3 + 5 - · · · =
                                2! 4!                    3! 5!

                      = cos  + i· sin .

Argument and polar coordinates

As before, we assume that O and E are the points with complex coordi-
nates 0 and 1 respectively.

    Let Z be a point distinct from O. Set  = OZ and  = EOZ. The
pair (, ) is called the polar coordinates of Z.

    If z is the complex coordinate of Z, then  = |z|. The value  is called
the argument of z (briefly,  = arg z). In this case,

                                z = ·ei· = ·(cos  + i· sin ).

                         z      Note that
                                            arg(z ·w)  arg z + arg w

only if the number

                         (v - u)·(z - w)

                         (v - w)·(z - u)

is real.

    The value (v-w)·(z-u) (v-u)·(w-z) is called the complex cross-ratio of u, w, v, and
z; it will be denoted by (u, w; v, z).

18.6. Exercise. Observe that the complex number z = 0 is real if and
only if arg z = 0 or ; in other words, 2· arg z  0.

    Use this observation to show that Theorem 18.5 is indeed a reformu-
lation of Corollary 9.13.

Method of complex coordinates

The following problem illustrates the method of complex coordinates.

18.7. Problem. Let OP V and OQW be isosceles right triangles

such that

                    V P O  =  OQW  =      
                                          2

and M be the midpoint of [V W ]. Assume P , Q, and M are distinct

points. Show that P M Q is an isosceles right triangle.

Solution. Choose the complex coordinates so that O is the origin; denote

by v, w, p, q, m the complex coordinates of the remaining points respec-

tively.
    Since OP V and OQW are isosceles and V P O = OQW = 2 ,

 and  imply that

           v - p = i·p,                   q - w = i·q.
148                           CHAPTER 18. COMPLEX COORDINATES

Therefore                                               O
                                                                         Q
           m  =  1  ·  (v  +  w)    =
                 2                           P

              = 1+i 2 ·p + 1-i 2 ·q.

    By straightforward computations, we get     V MW
that

                  p - m = i·(q - m).

In particular, |p - m| = |q - m| and arg q-m p-m = 2 ; that is, P M = QM
and QM P = 2 .

18.8. Exercise. Consider three squares with I A B C
common sides as on the diagram. Use the
method of complex coordinates to show that

     EOA + EOB + EOC = ± 2 .                    OE

18.9. Exercise. Check the following identity with six complex cross-
ratios:

                               (v, w; v, w)·(z, u; z, u)
     (u, w; v, z)·(u , w ; v , z ) =             .
                                       (u, v ; u , v)·(w, z ; w , z)

Use it together with Theorem 18.5 to prove that if U V W Z,            UV V U,
  V W W V , W ZZW , and ZU U Z are inscribed, then                    UV W Z

is inscribed as well.

18.10. Exercise. Suppose that points U , V and W lie on one side of

line (AB) and U AB  BV A  ABW . Denote by a, b, u, v, and

w the complex coordinates of A, B, U , V , and W respectively.
  (a) Show that u-a b-a = b-v a-v = a-b w-b = u-v w-v .
  (b) Conclude that U AB  BV A  ABW  U V W .
                                                                                           149

Fractional linear transformations

18.11. Exercise. Watch the video "M¨obius transformations revealed" by
Douglas Arnold and Jonathan Rogness. (It is available on YouTube.)

    The complex plane C extended by one ideal number  is called the
extended complex plane. It is denoted by C^ , so C^ = C  {}

    A fractional linear transformation or M¨obius transformation of C^ is a
function of one complex variable z that can be written as

                                     f (z) = a·z + b ,
                                               c·z + d

where the coefficients a, b, c, d are complex numbers satisfying a·d -
- b·c = 0. (If a·d - b·c = 0 the function defined above is a constant and
is not considered to be a fractional linear transformation.)

    In case c = 0, we assume that

f (-d/c) =  and f () = a/c;

and if c = 0 we assume

                        f () = .

Elementary transformations

The following three types of fractional linear transformations are called
elementary :

   1. z  z + w,
   2. z  w·z for w = 0,
   3. z  1z .

The geometric interpretations. Suppose that O denotes the point
with the complex coordinate 0.

    The first map z  z + w, corresponds to the so-called parallel trans-
lation of the Euclidean plane, its geometric meaning should be evident.

    The second map is called the rotational homothety with the center
at O. That is, the point O maps to itself and any other point Z maps to
a point Z such that OZ = |w|·OZ and ZOZ = arg w.

    The third map can be described as a composition of the inversion in
the unit circle centered at O and the reflection across R (the composition
can be taken in any order). Indeed, arg z  - arg 1z . Therefore,

                                    arg z = arg(1/z¯);
150                           CHAPTER 18. COMPLEX COORDINATES

that is, if the points Z and Z have complex coordinates z and 1/z¯, then

Z  [OZ). Clearly, OZ = |z| and OZ = |1/z¯| = |z|1 . Therefore, Z is

the inverse of Z in the unit circle centered at O.

  Finally,  1  =  (1/z¯)  is  the  complex  coordinate  of  the  reflection  of  Z
            z
across R.

18.12. Proposition. The map f : C^  C^ is a fractional linear transfor-
mation if and only if it can be expressed as a composition of elementary
transformations.

Proof; the "only if " part. Fix a fractional linear transformation
                             f (z) = a·z + b .
                                       c·z + d

Assume c = 0. Then

                    f (z) = a - a·d - b·c =
                              c c·(c·z + d)

                              = a - 2 a·d - b·c · d 1 .cc
                                                  z+ c

That is,

                          f (z) = f4  f3  f2  f1(z),

where f1, f2, f3, and f4 are the following elementary transformations:

            f1(z) = z + dc ,                      f2(z) = 1z ,
            f3(z) = - a·d- c2b·c ·z,              f4(z) = z + ac .

  If c = 0, then

                               f (z) = a·z + b .
                                            d

In this case, f (z) = f2  f1(z), where

               f1(z) = ad ·z,               f2(z) = z + bd .

"If " part. We need to show that by composing elementary transforma-
tions, we can only get fractional linear transformations. Note that it is
sufficient to check that the composition of a fractional linear transforma-
tion

                                     f (z) = a·z + b .
                                               c·z + d
                                                                                  151

with   any  elementary  transformation    z    z + w,     z    w·z,  and  z    1  is  a
                                                                               z
fractional linear transformation.

The latter is done by means of direct calculations.

                        a·(z + w) + b = a·z + (b + a·w) ,
                        c·(z + w) + d c·z + (d + c·w)

                        a·(w·z) + b = (a·w)·z + b ,
                        c·(w·z) + d (c·w)·z + d

                             a· z1 + b = b·z + a .1
                             c·  z  +  d  d·z + c

18.13. Corollary. The image of a circline under a fractional linear
transformation is a circline.

Proof. By Proposition 18.12, it is sufficient to check that each elementary

transformation sends a circline to a circline.

For the first and second elementary transformation, the latter is evi-

dent.

As     it   was  noted  above,  the  map  z    1   is  a  composition  of    inversion
                                               z
and reflection. By Theorem 10.11, the inversion sends a circline to a

circline. Hence the result.

18.14. Exercise. Show that the inverse of a fractional linear transfor-
mation is a fractional linear transformation.

18.15. Exercise. Given distinct values z0, z1, z  C^ , construct a frac-
tional linear transformation f such that

                   f (z0) = 0, f (z1) = 1 and f (z) = .

    Show that such a transformation is unique.

18.16. Exercise. Show that any inversion is a composition of the com-
plex conjugation and a fractional linear transformation.

    Use Theorem 14.15 to conclude that any inversive transformation is
either fractional linear transformation or a complex conjugate to a frac-
tional linear transformation.

Complex cross-ratio

Let u, v, w, and z be four distinct complex numbers.           Recall that the

complex number

                                 (u - w)·(v - z)

                                 (v - w)·(u - z)
152                 CHAPTER 18. COMPLEX COORDINATES

is called the complex cross-ratio of u, v, w, and z; it is denoted by

(u, v; w, z).

If one of the numbers u, v, w, z is , then the complex cross-ratio has

to be defined by taking the appropriate limit; in other words, we assume

that    =  1.  For  example,
      

                    (u, v; w, ) = (u - w) .
                                       (v - w)

    Assume that U , V , W , and Z are the points with complex coordinates
u, v, w, and z respectively. Note that

                    U W ·V Z = |(u, v; w, z)|,
                    V W ·UZ
               W U Z + ZV W = arg u - w + arg v - z 
                              u-z                v-w

                               arg(u, v; w, z).

These equations make it possible to reformulate Theorem 10.6 using the
complex coordinates the following way:

18.17. Theorem. Let U W V Z and U W V Z be two quadrangles such
that the points U , W , V , and Z are inverses of U , W , V , and Z respec-
tively. Assume u, w, v, z, u, w, v, and z are the complex coordinates
of U , W , V , Z, U , W , V , and Z respectively.

    Then
                              (u, v; w, z) = (u, v; w, z).

    The following exercise is a generalization of the theorem above. It has
a short solution using Proposition 18.12.

18.18. Exercise. Show that complex cross-ratios are invariant under
fractional linear transformations.

    That is, if a fractional linear transformation maps four distinct com-
plex numbers u, v, w, z to complex numbers u, v, w, z respectively, then

                              (u, v; w, z) = (u, v; w, z).

Schwarz-Pick theorem

The following theorem shows that the metric in the conformal disc model
naturally appears in other branches of mathematics. We do not give its
proof, but it can be found in any textbook on geometric complex analysis.

    Suppose that D denotes the unit disc in the complex plane centered
at 0; that is, a complex number z belongs to D if and only if |z| < 1.
                                                  153

    Let us use the disc D as an h-plane in the conformal disc model; the
h-distance between z, w  D will be denoted by dh(z, w); that is,

                                    dh(z, w) := ZWh,

where Z and W are h-points with complex coordinates z and w respec-
tively.

    A function f : D  C is called holomorphic if for every z  D there is
a complex number s such that

                           f (z + w) = f (z) + s·w + o(|w|).

In other words, f is complex-differentiable at any z  D. The complex
number s is called the derivative of f at z, or briefly s = f (z).

18.19. Schwarz-Pick theorem. Assume f : D  D is a holomorphic
function. Then

                               dh(f (z), f (w)) dh(z, w)

for any z, w  D.
    If the equality holds for one pair of distinct numbers z, w  D, then it

holds for any pair. In this case, f is a fractional linear transformation as
well as a motion of the h-plane.

18.20. Exercise. Show that if a fractional linear transformation f ap-
pears in the equality case of Schwarz-Pick theorem, then it can be written
as v·z + w¯

                                     f (z) = w·z + v¯ .
where v and w are complex constants such that |v| > |w|.

18.21. Exercise. Recall that hyperbolic tangent th is defined on page 99.

Show that  th[ 21 ·dh(z, w)] = z - w 1 - z ·w¯ .

Conclude that the inequality in Schwarz-Pick theorem can be rewritten as

            z - w                z-w ,
           1 - z ·w¯            1 - z ·w¯

where z = f (z) and w = f (w).

18.22. Exercise. Show that the Schwarz lemma stated below follows
from Schwarz-Pick theorem.

18.23. Schwarz lemma. Let f : D  D be a holomorphic function and
f (0) = 0. Then |f (z)| |z| for any z  D.

    Moreover, if equality holds for some z = 0, then there is a unit complex
number u such that f (z) = u·z for any z  D.

Geometric constructions

Geometric constructions have great pedagogical value as an introduction
to mathematical proofs. The geometric constructions were introduced at
the end of Chapter 5 and since that moment they were used everywhere
in the book.

    In this chapter, we briefly discuss classical geometric constructions.

Classical problems

In this section, we list a couple of classical construction problems; each
known for more than a thousand years.

    The solutions of the following two problems are quite nontrivial.
19.1. Problem of Brahmagupta. Construct an inscribed quadrangle
with given sides.

19.2. Problem of Apollonius. Construct a circle that is tangent to
three given circles.

    Several solutions of this problem based on different
ideas are presented in [9]. The following exercise is a
simplified version of the problem of Apollonius, which is
still nontrivial.
19.3. Exercise. Construct a circle that passes thru a
given point and is tangent to two intersecting lines.

    The following three problems cannot be solved in principle; that is,
the needed compass-and-ruler construction does not exist.
Doubling the cube. Construct the side of a new cube that has the
volume twice as big as the volume of a given cube.

                                             154
                                                                                           155

    In other words, given a segment of the length a, one needs to construct
a segment of length 3 2·a.

Squaring the circle. Construct a square with the same area as a given
circle.

    If r is the radius of the given circle, we need to construct a segment
of length ·r.

Angle trisection. Divide the given angle into three equal angles.

    In fact, there is no compass-and-ruler construction that trisects an-
gle with measure 3 . The existence of such a construction would imply
constructability of a regular 9-gon which is prohibited by the following
famous result:

    A regular n-gon inscribed in a circle with center O is a sequence of
points A1 . . . An on the circle such that

              AnOA1 = A1OA2 = · · · = An-1OAn = ± 2n ·.

The points A1, . . . , An are vertices, the segments [A1A2], . . . , [AnA1] are
sides and the remaining segments [AiAj] are diagonals of the n-gon.

    Construction of a regular n-gon, therefore, is reduced to the construc-
tion of an angle with size 2n ·.
19.4. Gauss-Wantzel theorem. A regular n-gon can be constructed
with a ruler and a compass if and only if n is the product of a power of 2
and any number of distinct Fermat primes.

    A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form 2k+1 for some integer k.
Only five Fermat primes are known today:

                                   3, 5, 17, 257, 65537.

For example,
     one can construct a regular 340-gon since 340 = 22·5·17 and 5, as
       well as 17, are Fermat primes;
     one cannot construct a regular 7-gon since 7 is not a Fermat prime;
     one cannot construct a regular 9-gon; altho 9 = 3·3 is a product of
       two Fermat primes, these primes are not distinct.
    The impossibility of these constructions was proved only in the 19th

century. The method used in the proofs is indicated in the next section.

Constructible numbers

In the classical compass-and-ruler constructions initial configuration can
be completely described by a finite number of points; each line is defined
156  CHAPTER 19. GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTIONS

by two points on it and each circle is described by its center and a point
on it (equivalently, you may describe a circle by three points on it).

    In the same way, the result of construction can be described by a finite
collection of points.

    We may always assume that the initial configuration has at least two
points; if not add one or two points to the configuration. Moreover,
applying a scaling to the whole plane, we can assume that the first two
points in the initial configuration lie at distance 1 from each other.

    In this case, we can choose a coordinate system, such that one of
the initial points is the origin (0, 0) and yet another initial point has the
coordinates (1, 0). In this coordinate system, the initial configuration of
n points is described by 2·n - 4 numbers their coordinates x3, y3, . . .
. . . , xn, yn.

    It turns out that the coordinates of any point constructed with a
compass and ruler can be written thru the numbers x3, y3, . . . , xn, yn using
the four arithmetic operations "+", "-", " ·", "/" and the square root " ".

    For example, assume we want to find the points X1 = (x1, y1) and
X2 = (x2, y2) of the intersections of a line passing thru A = (xA, yA) and
B = (xB, yB) and the circle with center O = (xO, yO) that passes thru
the point W = (xW , yW ). Let us write the equations of the circle and the
line in the coordinates (x, y):

              (x - xO)2 + (y - yO)2 = (xW - xO)2 + (yW - yO)2,

                  (x - xA)·(yB - yA) = (y - yA)·(xB - xA).

Note that coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of the points X1 and X2 are
solutions of this system. Expressing y from the second equation and
substituting the result in the first one, gives us a quadratic equation in x,
which can be solved using "+", "-", " ·", "/" and " " only.

    The same can be performed for the intersection of two circles. The
intersection of two lines is even simpler; it is described as a solution of
two linear equations and can be expressed using only four arithmetic
operations; the square root " " is not needed.

    On the other hand, it is easy to make compass-and-ruler constructions
that produce segments of the lengths a + b and a - b from two given
segments of lengths a > b. 

    To perform " ·", "/" and " " consider the following diagram: let [AB]
be a diameter of a circle; fix a point C on the circle and let D be the foot
point of C on [AB]. By Corollary 9.8, the angle ACB is right. Therefore

                            ABC  ACD  CBD.

It follows that AD·BD = CD2.

Using this diagram, one should guess a so-                    C

lution to the following exercise.

19.5. Exercise. Given two line segments with
a2 lengths a and b, give a ruler-and-compass con- A D B
struction of a segments with lengths b and


  a·b.

 Taking 1 for a or b above, we can produce                              
a, a2, 1b . Combining these constructions we can produce a·b = ( a·b)2,
ab = a· 1b . In other words we produced a compass-and-ruler calculator
which can do "+", "-", " ·", "/", and " ".

The discussion above gives a sketch of the proof of the following the-

orem:

19.6. Theorem. Assume that the initial configuration of geometric con-
struction is given by the points A1 = (0, 0), A2 = (1, 0), A3 = (x3, y3), . . .
. . . , An = (xn, yn). Then a point X = (x, y) can be constructed using a
compass-and-ruler construction if and only if both coordinates x and y can
be expressed from the integer numbers and x3, y3, x4, y4, . . . , xn, ynusing
the arithmetic operations "+", "-", " ·", "/", and the square root " ".

    The numbers that can be expressed fromthe given numbers using the
arithmetic operations and the square root " " are called constructible;
if the list of given numbers is not given, then we can only use the integers.

    The theorem above translates any compass-and-ruler construction
problem into a purely algebraic language. For example:

     The impossibility of a solution for doubling the cube problem states
       that 3 2 is not a constructible number. That is 3 2 cannot be ex-
                                                                           
       pressed thru integers using "+", "-", " ·", "/", and " ".

     The impossibility of a solution for squaring the circle states that
          , or equivalently , is not a constructible number.

     The Gauss-Wantzel theorem says for which integers n the number
       cos 2· n is constructible.

Some of these statements might look evident, but rigorous proofs require
some knowledge of abstract algebra (namely, field theory) which is out of
the scope of this book.

    In the next section, we discuss similar but simpler examples of impos-
sible constructions with an unusual tool.

19.7. Exercise.                                         

(a)    Show  that  diagonal  or  regular  pentagon  is  1+    5  times  larger  than
                                                           2
       its side.

(b) Use (a) to make a compass-and-ruler construction of a regular pen-

       tagon.

Constructions with a set-square

A set-square is a construction tool shown in the picture

it can produce a line thru a given point that makes

the  angles     or  ± 4  to  a  given  line  and  it  can  be  also
             2
used as a ruler; that is, it can produce a line thru a

given pair of points.

19.8. Exercise. Trisect a given segment with a set-square.

    Let us consider set-square constructions. Following the same lines as
in the previous section, we can define set-square constructible numbers
and prove the following analog of Theorem 19.6:

19.9. Theorem. Assume that the initial configuration of a geomet-

ric construction is given by the points A1 = (0, 0), A2 = (1, 0), A3 =
= (x3, y3), . . . , An = (xn, yn). Then a point X = (x, y) can be constructed
using a set-square construction if and only if both coordinates x and y can

be expressed from the integer numbers and x3, y3, x4, y4, . . . , xn, yn using
the arithmetic operations "+", "-", " ·", and "/" only.

    Let us apply this theorem to show the impossibility of some construc-
tions with a set-square.

    Note that if all the coordinates x3, y3, . . . , xn, yn are rational numbers,
then the theorem above implies that with a set-square, one can only con-
struct the points with rational coordinates. A point with both rational
coordinates is called rational, and if at least one of the coordinates is
irrational, then the point is called irrational.

19.10. Exercise. Show that an equilateral triangle in the Euclidean
plane has at least one irrational point.

    Conclude that with a set-square, one cannot construct an equilateral
triangle with a given base.

Verifications

Suppose we need to verify that a given configuration is defined by a certain
property. Is it possible to do this task by a geometric construction with
given tools? We assume that we can verify that two constructed points
coincide.

    Evidently, if a configuration is constructible, then it is verifiable
simply repeat the construction and check if the result is the same. Some
nonconstuctable configurations are verifiable. For example, it does not
pose a problem to verify that the given angle is trisected while it is im-
possible to trisect a given angle with ruler and compass. A regular 7-gon
                                                                                           159

provides another example of that type it is easy to verify, while Gauss-
Wantzel theorem states that it is impossible to construct with ruler and
compass.

    Since we did not prove the impossibility of angle trisection and Gauss-
Wantzel theorem, the following example might be more satisfactory. It is
based on Exercise 19.10 which states that it is impossible to construct an
equilateral with set-square only.

19.11. Exercise. Make a set-square construction verifying that a given
triangle is equilateral.

    This observation leads to a source of impossible constructions in a
stronger sense those that are even not verifiable.

    The following example is closely related to Exercise 10.9. Recall that
a circumtool produces a circle passing thru any given three points or a
line if all three points lie on one line.

Problem. Show that with a circumtool only, it is impossible to verify
that a given point is the center of a given circle . In particular, it is
impossible to construct the center with a circumtool only.

Remark. In geometric constructions, we allow to choose some free points,
say any point on the plane, or a point on a constructed line, or a point
that does not lie on a constructed line, or a point on a given line that
does not lie on a given circle, and so on.

    In principle, when you make such a free choice it is possible to make
a right construction by accident. Nevertheless, we do not accept such a
coincidence as true construction; we say that a construction produces the
center if it produces it for any free choices.

Solution. Arguing by contradiction, assume we have a verifying construc-
tion.

    Apply an inversion in a circle perpendicular to  to the whole con-
struction. According to Corollary 10.16, the circle  maps to itself. Since
the inversion sends a circline to a circline, we get that the whole construc-
tion is mapped to an equivalent construction; that is, a constriction with
a different choice of free points.

    According to Exercise 10.8, the inversion sends the center of  to
another point. However, this construction claims that this another point
is the center a contradiction.

    A similar example of impossible constructions for a ruler and a parallel
tool is given in Exercise 14.8.

    Let us discuss another example for a ruler-only construction. Note
that ruler-only constructions are invariant with respect to the projective
160  CHAPTER 19. GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTIONS

transformations. In particular, to solve the following exercise, it is suffi-
cient to construct a projective transformation that fixes two points and
moves their midpoint.

19.12. Exercise. Show that there is no ruler-only construction verifying
that a given point is a midpoint of a given segment. In particular, it is
impossible to construct the midpoint only with a ruler.

    The following theorem is a stronger version of the exercise above.

19.13. Theorem. There is no ruler-only construction verifying that a
given point is the center of a given circle. In particular, it is impossible
to construct the center only with a ruler.

    The proof uses the construction in Exercise 16.6.

Sketch of the proof. The same argument as in the problem above shows
that it is sufficient to construct a projective transformation that sends the
given circle  to a circle  such that the center of  is not the image of
the center of .

    Choose a circle  that lies in the plane  in the Euclidean space. By
Theorem 16.3, the inverse of a circle in a sphere is a circle or a line. Fix
a sphere  with the center O so that the inversion  of  is a circle and
the plane  containing  is not parallel to ; any sphere  in a general
position will do.

    Let Z and Z denote the centers of  and . Note that Z / (OZ).
It follows that the perspective projection    with center O sends 
to , but Z is not the image of Z.

Comparison of construction tools

We say that one set of tools is stronger than another if any configuration of
points that can be constructed with the second set can be constructed with
the first set as well. If in addition, there is a configuration constructible
with the first set, but not constructible with the second, then we say that
the first set is strictly stronger than the second. Otherwise (that is, if any
configuration that can be constructed with the first set can be constructed
with the second), we say that the sets of tools are equivalent.

    For example, Mohr-Mascheroni theorem states that compass alone is
equivalent to compass and ruler. Note that one may not construct a line
with a compass, but since we consider only configurations of points we do
not have to. One may think that a line is constructed if we construct two
points on it.

    For sure compass and ruler form a stronger set than compass alone.
Therefore Mohr-Mascheroni theorem will follow once we solve the follow-
ing two construction problems:
                                                                                           161

  (i) Given four points X, Y , P , and Q, construct the intersection of the
       lines (XY ) and (P Q) with compass only.

  (ii) Given four points X, Y , and a circle , construct the intersection
       of the lines (XY ) and  with compass only.

Indeed, once we have these two constructions, we can do every step of a
compass-and-ruler construction using a compass alone.

19.14. Exercise. Compare the following set of tools: (a) a ruler and
compass, (b) a set-square, and (c) a ruler and a parallel tool.

    Another classical example is the so-called Poncelet-Steiner theorem;
it states that the set of compass and ruler is equivalent to ruler alone,
provided that a single circle and its center are given.
Chapter 20

Area

Area will be defined as a function satisfying certain conditions (page 164).
The so-called Lebesgue measure gives an example of such a function. In
particular, the existence Lebesgue measure implies the existence of an area
function. This construction is included in any textbook in real analysis.

    Based solely on its existence, we develop the concept of area with no
cheating. We choose this approach since any rigorous introduction to area
is tedious. We do not want to cheat and at the same time we do not want
to waste your time; soon or later you will have to learn Lebesgue measure
if it is not done already.

Solid triangles

We say that the point X lies inside a nondegenerate    C

triangle ABC if the following three condition hold:       XB
     A and X lie on the same side of the line (BC);

 B and X lie on the same side of the line (CA); A
 C and X lie on the same side of the line (AB).

The set of all points inside ABC and on its sides [AB], [BC], [CA]

will be called solid triangle ABC and denoted by ABC.

20.1. Exercise. Show that any solid triangle is convex; that is, for any
pair of points X, Y  ABC, then the line segment [XY ] lies in ABC.

    The notations ABC and ABC look similar, they also have close
but different meanings, which better not to confuse. Recall that ABC
is an ordered triple of distinct points (see page 16), while ABC is an
infinite set of points.

    In particular, ABC = BAC for any triangle ABC. Indeed, any
point that belongs to the set ABC also belongs to the set BAC and

                 162
                                                                                           163

the other way around. On the other hand, ABC = BAC simply
because the ordered triple of points (A, B, C) is distinct from the ordered
triple (B, A, C).

    Note that ABC = BAC even if ABC  BAC, where congru-
ence of the sets ABC and BAC is understood the following way:

20.2. Definition. Two sets S and T in the plane are called congruent
(briefly S = T ) if T = f (S) for some motion f of the plane.

    If ABC is not degenerate and

                                  ABC = ABC,

then after relabeling the vertices of ABC we will have

                                  ABC = ABC.

    Indeed it is sufficient to show that if f is a motion that maps ABC
to ABC, then f maps each vertex of ABC to a vertex ABC.
The latter follows from the characterization of vertices of solid triangles
given in the following exercise:

20.3. Exercise. Let ABC be nondegenerate and X  ABC. Show
that X is a vertex of ABC if and only if there is a line  that intersects
ABC at the single point X.

Polygonal sets

Elementary set on the plane is a set of one of the following three types:
     one-point set;
     segment;
     solid triangle.
    A set in the plane is called polygonal if it can be

presented as a union of a finite collection of elementary
sets.

    Note that according to this definition, the empty
set  is a polygonal set. Indeed,  is a union of an empty collection of
elementary sets.

    A polygonal set is called degenerate if it can be presented as a union
of a finite collection of one-point sets and segments.

    If X and Y lie on opposite sides of the line (AB), then the union
AXB  BY A is a polygonal set which is called solid quadrangle
AXBY and denoted by AXBY . In particular, we can talk about solid
parallelograms, rectangles, and squares.
164  CHAPTER 20. AREA

                                        Typically a polygonal set admits many pre-
                                   sentations as a union of a finite collection of
                                   elementary sets. For example, if AXBY is a
                                   parallelogram, then

                AXBY = AXB  AY B = XAY  XBY.

20.4. Exercise. Show that a solid square is not degenerate.

20.5. Exercise. Show that a circle is not a polygonal set.

20.6. Claim. For any two polygonal sets P and Q, the union P  Q, as
well as the intersection P  Q, are also polygonal sets.

    A class of sets that is closed with respect to union and intersection is
called a ring of sets. The claim above, therefore, states that polygonal
sets in the plane form a ring of sets.

Informal proof. Let us present P and Q as a union of a finite collection
of elementary sets P1, . . . , Pk and Q1, . . . , Qn respectively.

                          Note that

                                 P  Q = P1  · · ·  Pk  Q1  · · ·  Qn.

                      Therefore, P  Q is polygonal.
                          Note that P Q is the union of sets PiQj for all i and

                      j. Therefore, in order to show that P  Q is polygonal,
                      it is sufficient to show that each Pi  Qj is polygonal for
any pair i, j.
    The diagram should suggest an idea for the proof of the latter state-
ment in case if Pi and Qj are solid triangles. The other cases are simpler;
a formal proof can be built on Exercise 20.1

Definition of area

Area is defined as a function P  area P that returns a nonnegative
real number area P for any polygonal set P and satisfying the following
conditions:

  (a) area K1 = 1 where K1 a solid square with unit side;
  (b) the conditions

                              P = Q  area P = area Q;
                              P  Q  area P area Q;
                     area P + area Q = area(P  Q) + area(P  Q)

       hold for any two polygonal sets P and Q.
                                                                                           165

    The first condition is called normalization; essentially it says that a
solid unit square is used as a unit to measure area. The three conditions
in (b) are called invariance, monotonicity, and additivity.

    The Lebesgue measure provides an example of area function; namely,
if one takes area of P to be its Lebesgue measure, then the function
P  area P satisfies the above conditions.

    The construction of the Lebesgue measure can be found in any text-
book on real analysis. We do not discuss it here.

    If the reader is not familiar with the Lebesgue measure, then he should
take the existence of area function as granted; it might be considered as
an additional axiom altho it follows from the axioms I-V.

Vanishing area and subdivisions

20.7. Proposition. Any one-point set, as well as any segment in the
Euclidean plane, have vanishing area.

Proof. Fix a line segment [AB]. Consider a sold square ABCD.

Note that given a positive integer n, there are n disjoint segments

[A1B1], . . . , [AnBn] in ABCD, such that each [AiBi] is congruent to

[AB] in the sense of the Definition 20.2.

Applying invariance, additivity, and mono-       B1 B2 . . . Bn

tonicity of the area function, we get that

n· area[AB] = area ([A1B1]  · · ·  [AnBn])
                   area( ABCD)

That is,

          area[AB]  1  ·  area(  ABCD)           A1 A2  ...        An
                    n

for any positive integer n. Therefore, area[AB]  0. On the other hand,
by definition of area, area[AB] 0, hence

                                 area[AB] = 0.

For any one-point set {A} we have that {A}  [AB]. Therefore,

                       0 area{A} area[AB] = 0.

Whence area{A} = 0.

20.8. Corollary. Any degenerate polygonal set has vanishing area.
166                                                       CHAPTER 20. AREA

Proof. Let P be a degenerate set, say

                 P = [A1B1]  · · ·  [AnBn]  {C1, . . . , Ck}.

Since area is nonnegative by definition, applying additivity several times,
we get that

                    area P     area[A1B1] + · · · + area[AnBn]+
                               + area{C1} + · · · + area{Ck}.

By Proposition 20.7, the right-hand side vanishes.
    On the other hand, area P 0, hence the result.

    We say that polygonal set P is subdivided into two polygonal sets
Q1, . . . , Qn if P = Q1 · · ·Qn and the intersection Qi Qj is degenerate
for any pair i and j. (Recall that according to Claim 20.6, the intersections
Qi  Qj are polygonal.)

20.9. Proposition. Assume polygonal sets P is subdivided into polygo-
nal sets Q1, . . . , Qn. Then

                          area P = area Q1 + · · · + area Qn.

Proof. Assume n = 2; by additivity of area,

  area P = area Q1 + area Q2 - area(Q1  Q2).                                          Q2
Since Q1  Q2 is degenerate, by Corollary 20.8,                            Q1

                              area(Q1  Q2) = 0.                                 R

    Applying this formula a few times we get the general case. Indeed, if
P is subdivided into Q1, . . . , Qn, then

             area P = area Q1 + area(Q2  · · ·  Qn) =
                      = area Q1 + area Q2 + area(Q3  · · ·  Qn) =
                         ..
                         .
                      = area Q1 + area Q2 + · · · + area Qn.

Remark. Two polygonal sets P and P are called equidecomposable if

they   admit  subdivisions     into      polygonal  sets  Q1, . . . , Qn  and  Q     ,  .  .  .  ,  Q  
                 =                                                                1                    n
                    Q
such   that  Qi           for  each  i.
                       i

According to the proposition, if P and P are equidecomposable, then

area P = area P. A converse to this statement also holds; namely, if two

nondegenerate polygonal sets have equal area, then they are equidecompos-

able.

The last statement was proved by William Wallace, Farkas Bolyai and

Paul Gerwien. The analogous statement in three dimensions, known as

Hilbert's third problem, is false; it was proved by Max Dehn.
                                                                        167

Area of solid rectangles

20.10. Theorem. A solid rectangle with sides a and b has area a·b.

20.11. Algebraic lemma. Assume that a function s returns a nonneg-
ative real number s(a, b) for any pair of positive real numbers (a, b) and
it satisfies the following identities:

                                  s(1, 1) = 1;
                             s(a, b + c) = s(a, b) + s(a, c)
                             s(a + b, c) = s(a, c) + s(b, c)

for any a, b, c > 0. Then

                              s(a, b) = a·b

for any a, b > 0.

     The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 14.14.

Proof. Note that if a > a and b > b then

                              s(a, b) s(a, b).

Indeed, since s returns nonnegative numbers, we get that

                    s(a, b) = s(a, b) + s(a - a, b)
                                s(a, b) =
                                s(a, b) + s(a, b - b)
                                s(a, b).

     Applying the second and third identity few times we get that

                    s(a, m·b) = s(m·a, b) = m·s(a, b)

for any positive integer m. Therefore

                    s( kl , mn ) = k·s( 1l , mn ) =

    Arguing by contradiction, assume s(a, b) = a·b for some pair of pos-
itive real numbers (a, b). We will consider two cases: s(a, b) > a·b and
s(a, b) < a·b.

    If s(a, b) > a·b, we can choose a positive integer n such that

                     s(a, b) > (a + n1 )·(b + 1n ).

Set k = a·n + 1 and m = b·n + 1; equivalently, k and m are positive
integers such that

     a < kn a + 1n and b < mn b + 1n .

By , we get that

                     s(a, b) s( kn , mn ) =
                             = kn · mn
                                 (a + n1 )·(b + 1n ),

which contradicts .

    The case s(a, b) < a·b is similar. Fix a positive integer n such that
a > 1n , b > 1n , and

                     s(a, b) < (a - n1 )·(b - 1n ).

Set k = a·n - 1 and m = b·n - 1; that is,

     a > kn a - 1n and b > mn b - 1n .

Applying  again, we get that

                     s(a, b) s( kn , mn ) =
                             = kn · mn
                                 (a - n1 )·(b - 1n ),

which contradicts .

Proof of Theorem 20.10. Suppose that Ra,b denotes the solid rectangle
with sides a and b. Set

                                   s(a, b) = area Ra,b.

    By definition of area, s(1, 1) = area(K) = 1. That is, the first identity
in the algebraic lemma holds.
                                                         169

    Note that the rectangle Ra+b,c can be sub-
divided into two rectangles congruent to Ra,c Rb,c Ra,c
and Rb,c. Therefore, by Proposition 20.9,

  area Ra+b,c = area Ra,c + area Rb,c        Ra+b,c

That is, the second identity in the algebraic lemma holds. The proof of
the third identity is similar.

    It remains to apply the algebraic lemma.

Area of solid parallelograms

20.12. Proposition. Let ABCD be a parallelogram in the Euclidean
plane, a = AB and h be the distance between the lines (AB) and (CD).
Then

                                 area( ABCD) = a·h.

Proof. Let A and B denote the foot points A B D C
of A and B on the line (CD).

  Note that ABBA is a rectangle with

sides a and h. By Proposition 20.10,

                                       A  B

  area( ABBA) = h·a.

  Without loss of generality, we may assume that ABCA contains
ABCD and ABBA. In this case, ABCA admits two subdivisions:

  ABCA = ABCD  AAD = ABBA  BBC.

    By Proposition 20.9,
             area( ABCD) + area(AAD) =

 = area( ABBA) + area(BBC).

    Note that  AAD = BBC.


Indeed, since the quadrangles ABBA and ABCD are parallelograms,
by Lemma 7.18, we have that AA = BB, AD = BC, and DC = AB =
= AB. It follows that AD = BC. Applying the SSS congruence

condition, we get .

    In particular,

               area(BBC) = area(AAD).

are two parallelograms such that B  [BC] and D 
 [CD]. Show that

           area( ABCD) = area( ABCD).

Area of solid triangles

20.14. Theorem. Let hA be the altitude from A in ABC and a = BC.

Then

        area(ABC)              =     1  ·  a  ·  h  A  .
                                     2

Proof. Draw the line m thru A that is parallel to (BC) and line n thru C
parallel to (AB). Note that the lines m and n are not parallel; denote by D
their point of intersection. By construction, ABCD is a parallelogram.

    Note that ABCD admits a subdivision into ABC and CDA.
Therefore,

        area( ABCD) = area(ABC) + area(CDA)

DnC         Since ABCD is a parallelogram, Lemma 7.18
        implies that

     m  AB = CD and BC = DA.

        Therefore, by the SSS congruence condition, we have
        B ABC = CDA. In particular
     A

        area(ABC) = area(CDA).

From above and Proposition 20.12, we get that

        area(ABC) = 12 · area( ABCD) =

        =  1             ·  h  A  ·  a
           2

20.15. Exercise. Let hA, hB, and hC denote the altitudes of ABC
from vertices A, B and C respectively. Note that from Theorem 20.14, it
follows that

                             hA ·BC = hB ·CA = hC ·AB.

is, M belongs to the solid parallelogram ABCD, but does not lie on its

rimeter;  that  is,  p  =  1  ·  (AB  + BC  + CA).  Show  that

                                 area(ABC) = p·r.

20.19. Exercise. Show that any polygonal set admits a subdivision into
a finite collection of solid triangles and a degenerate set. Conclude that
for any polygonal set, its area is uniquely defined.

Area method

In this section, we will give examples of slim proofs using the properties

of area. Note that these proofs are not truly elementary since the price

one pays to introduce the area function is high.

We start with the proof of the Pythagorean theorem.

In the Elements of Euclid, the Pythagorean theorem was           T
formulated as equality  below and the proof used a sim-                Kb
ilar technique.
                                                                T
Proof. We need to show that if a and b are legs and c is
                                                                Ka T T

the hypotenuse of a right triangle, then                        T      T

                              a2 + b2 = c2.                        Kc

    Suppose that T denotes the right solid triangle with T T

legs a and b and Kx the solid square with side x.
    Let us construct two subdivisions of Ka+b:
   1. Subdivide Ka+b into two solid squares congruent to Ka and Kb and
       4 solid triangles congruent to T , see the first diagram.
172                                              CHAPTER 20. AREA

  2. Subdivide Ka+b into one solid square congruent to Kc and 4 solid
     right triangles congruent to T , see the second diagram.

  Applying Proposition 20.9 few times, we get that

            area Ka+b = area Ka + area Kb + 4· area T =
                         = area Kc + 4· area T .

Therefore,

                   area Ka + area Kb = area Kc.

By Theorem 20.10,

                   area Kx = x2,

for any x > 0. Hence the statement follows.

20.20. Exercise. Build another proof of the Pythagorean
theorem based on the diagram.

    (In the notations above it shows a subdivision of Kc into
Ka-b and four copies of T if a > b.)

20.21. Exercise. Show that the sum of distances from a point to the
sides of an equilateral triangle is the same for all points inside the trian-
gle.

20.22. Claim. Assume that two triangles ABC and ABC in the Eu-

clidean plane have equal altitudes dropped from A and A respectively.

Then               area(ABC) = BC .
                    area(ABC) BC

    In particular, the same identity holds if A = A and the bases [BC]
and [BC] lie on one line.

Proof. Let h be the altitude. By Theorem 20.14,

            area(ABC) 12 ·h·BC BC
                   =1                        =   .
            area(ABC) 2 ·h·BC BC

    Now let us show how to use this claim to prove Lemma 8.8. First, let
us recall its statement:

Lemma 8.8. If ABC is nondegenerate and its angle bisector at A
intersects [BC] at the point D. Then

                   AB = DB .
                   AC DC
                                                                173

Proof. Applying Claim 20.22, we get that                     A

area(ABD) = BD .
area(ACD) CD

By Proposition 8.10 the triangles ABD and
ACD have equal altitudes from D. Applying C D                   B

Claim 20.22 again, we get that

               area(ABD) = AB
               area(ACD) AC

and hence the result.

    Suppose ABC is a nondegenerate triangle and A lies between B and
C. In this case, the line segment [AA] is called cevian1 of ABC at A.
The second statement in the following exercise is called Ceva's theorem.

20.23. Exercise. Let ABC be a nondegenerate triangle. Suppose its
cevians [AA], [BB] and [CC] intersect at one point X. Show that

area(ABX) AB                                       A
                   = ,                                  B

area(BCX) BC
                                                   X
                   = ,
area(CAX) C A                                B A                C
area(CAX) CA

                   = .
area(ABX) A B

Conclude that  AB ·CA ·BC = 1.
               BC ·AB ·CA

20.24. Exercise. Suppose that points L1,         L1 L2 L3 L4
L2, L3, L4 lie on a line  and points M1,                  O
M2, M3, M4 lie on a line m. Assume that the
lines (L1M1), (L2M2), (L3M3), and (L4M4)     M4 M3 M2 M1
pass thru a point O that does not lie on 

nor m.

  (a) Apply Claim 20.22 to show that

               area OLiLj = OLi ·OLj

   (b) Use (a) to prove that

                                 L1L2 ·L3L4 = M1M2 ·M3M4 ;
                                 L2L3 ·L4L1 M2M3 ·M4M1

        that is, the quadruples (L1, L2, L3, L4) and (M1, M2, M3, M4) have
        the same cross-ratio.

Area in the neutral planes and spheres

Area can be defined in the neutral planes and spheres. In the definition,
the solid unit square K1 has to be exchanged to a fixed nondegenerate
polygonal set U. One has to make such a change for good reason
hyperbolic plane and sphere have no squares.

    In this case, the set U plays the role of the unit measure for the area
and changing U will require conversion of area units.

                              According to the standard convention, the set U is
 A D taken so that on small scales area behaves like area

                         in the Euclidean plane. Say, if Ka denotes the solid
                         quadrangle ABCD with right angles at A, B, and
                         C such that AB = BC = a, then we may assume that

B              C                       1   ·  area  Ka    1  as    a  0.
                                       a2

    This convention works equally well for spheres and neutral planes,
including the Euclidean plane. In spherical geometry equivalently we

may assume that if r is the radius of the sphere, then the area of the
whole sphere is 4··r2.

    Recall that defect of triangle ABC is defined as

          defect(ABC) :=  - |ABC| - |BCA| - |CAB|.

It turns out that any neutral plane or sphere there is a real number k
such that

                    k· area(ABC) + defect(ABC) = 0

for any ABC.

   This number k is called curvature; k = 0 for the Euclidean plane,

k  =  -1  for  the  h-plane,  k  =  1  for    the   unit  sphere,  and  k  =  1   for  the
                                                                              r2
sphere of radius r.

   Since the angles of ideal triangle vanish, any ideal triangle in h-plane

has area . Similarly, in the unit sphere the area of equilateral triangle

with right angles has area 2 ; since whole sphere can be subdivided in
eight such triangles, we get that the area of unit sphere is 4·.
                                                                                           175

    The identity  can be used as an alternative way to introduce area
function; it works on spheres and all neutral planes, except for the Eu-
clidean plane.

Quadrable sets

A set S in the plane is called quadrable if for any  > 0 there are two
polygonal sets P and Q such that

                     P  S  Q and area Q - area P < .

    If S is quadrable, its area can be defined as the necessarily unique real
number s = area S such that the inequality

                                  area Q s area P

holds for any polygonal sets P and Q such that P  S  Q.

20.25. Exercise. Let D be the unit disc; that is, D is a set that contains
the unit circle  and all the points inside .

    Show that D is a quadrable set.

    Since D is quadrable, the expression area D makes sense and the con-
stant  can be defined as  = area D.

    It turns out that the class of quadrable sets is the largest class for
which the area function satisfying the conditions on page 164 is uniquely
defined.

    If you do not require uniqueness, then there are ways to extend area
function to all bounded sets. (A set in the plane is called bounded if it
lies inside of a circle.) On the sphere and hyperbolic plane, there is no
similar construction. If you wonder why, read about doubling the ball, a
paradox of Felix Hausdorff, Stefan Banach, and Alfred Tarski.
Hints

1.2. Check the triangle inequality for A = 0, B = 1 and C = 2.

1.3. Only the triangle inequality requires a proof the rest of the conditions in Defini-
tion 1.1 are evident. Let A = (xA, yA), B = (xB, yB), and C = (xC, yC). Set

                     x1 = xB - xA,                   y1 = yB - yA,
                     x2 = xC - xB,                   y2 = yC - yB .

(a). The inequality  d1(A, C) d1(A, B) + d1(B, C)
can be written as

                     |x1 + x2| + |y1 + y2| |x1| + |y1| + |x2| + |y2|.

The latter follows since |x1 + x2|  |x1| + |x2| and |y1 + y2|  |y1| + |y2|.
(b). The inequality

                     d2(A, C) d2(A, B) + d2(B, C)

can be written as

                     x1 + x2 2 + y1 + y2 2   x2   +  y2   +    x2   +  y22.

                                               1       1         2

Take the square of the left and the right-hand sides, simplify, take the square again and
simplify again. You should get the following inequality:

                                              0 (x1 ·y2 - x2 ·y1)2,

which is equivalent to  and evidently true.

(c). The inequality  d(A, C) d(A, B) + d(B, C)
can be written as

  max{|x1 + x2|, |y1 + y2|} max{|x1|, |y1|} + max{|x2|, |y2|}.

                                    176
                                                                           177

Without loss of generality, we may assume that

          max{|x1 + x2|, |y1 + y2|} = |x1 + x2|.

Further,

          |x1 + x2| |x1| + |x2| max{|x1|, |y1|} + max{|x2|, |y2|}.

Hence  follows.
1.4. Sum up four triangle inequalities.
1.5. If A = B, then dX (A, B) > 0. Since f is distance-preserving,

          dY (f (A), f (B)) = dX (A, B).

Therefore, dY (f (A), f (B)) > 0; hence f (A) = f (B).

1.6. Set f (0) = a and f (1) = b. Note that b = a + 1 or a - 1. Moreover, f (x) = a ± x and
at the same time, f (x) = b ± (x - 1) for any x.

     If b = a + 1, it follows that f (x) = a + x for any x.
     In the same way, if b = a - 1, it follows that f (x) = a - x for any x.

1.7. Show that the map (x, y)  (x + y, x - y) is an isometry (R2, d1)  (R2, d). That
is, you need to check if this map is bijective and distance-preserving.

1.8. First prove that two points A = (xA, yA) and B = (xB, yB) on the Manhattan plane
have a unique midpoint if and only if xA = xB or yA = yB; compare with the example on
page 17.

     Then use the above statement to prove that any motion of the Manhattan plane can
be written in one of the following two ways:

          (x, y)  (±x + a, ±y + b)  or          (x, y)  (±y + b, ±x + a),

for some fixed real numbers a and b. (In each case we have 4 choices of signs, so for a fixed
pair (a, b) we have 8 distinct motions.)

1.10. Assume three points A, B, and C lie on one line. Note that in this case one of the
triangle inequalities with the points A, B, and C becomes an equality.

     Set A = (-1, 1), B = (0, 0), and C = (1, 1). Show that for d1 and d2 all the triangle
inequalities with the points A, B, and C are strict. It follows that the graph is not a line.

     For d show that (x, |x|)  x gives the isometry of the graph to R. Conclude that
the graph is a line in (R2, d).

1.11. Spell the definitions of line and motion.

1.12. Fix an isometry f : (P Q)  R such that f (P ) = 0 and f (Q) = q > 0.
     Assume that f (X) = x. By the definition of the half-line X  [P Q) if and only if

x 0. Show that the latter holds if and only if |x - q| = |x| - |q| . Hence (a) follows.
     To prove(b), observe that X  [P Q] if and only if 0 x q. Show that the latter

holds if and only if |x - q| + |x| = |q|.

1.13. The equation 2·  0 means that 2· = 2·k· for some integer k. Therefore,

     Equivalently,  = 2·n· or  = (2·n + 1)· for some integer n. The first identity
means that   0 and the second means that   .

1.14. (a). By the triangle inequality, |f (A) - f (A)|  d(A, A). Therefore, we can take
 = .

(b). By the triangle inequality,

     |f (A, B) - f (A, B)|        |f (A, B) - f (A, B)| + |f (A, B) - f (A, B)|
                                  d(A, A) + d(B, B).

Therefore, we can take  = 2 .
1.15. Fix A  X and B  Y such that f (A) = B.

     Fix  > 0. Since g is continuous at B, there is a positive value 1 such that

                                dZ (g(B), g(B)) <  if dY (B, B) < 1.

Since f is continuous at A, there is 2 > 0 such that
                          dY (f (A), f (A)) < 1 if dX (A, A) < 2.

Since f (A) = B, we get that

     dZ (h(A), h(A)) <  if dX (A, A) < 2.

Hence the result.

2.1. By Axiom I, there are at least two points in the plane. Therefore, by Axiom II,
the plane contains a line. To prove (a), it remains to note that a line is an infinite set of
points. To prove (b) apply in addition Axiom III.

2.3. By Axiom II, (OA) = (OA). Therefore, the statement boils down to the following:
     Assume f : R  R is a motion of the line that sends 0  0 and one positive number

to a positive number, then f is an identity map.
     The latter follows from 1.6.

2.6. By Proposition 2.5, AOA = 0. It remains to apply Axiom IIIa.

2.10. Apply Proposition 2.5, Theorem 2.8 and 1.13.

2.11. By Axiom IIIb, 2·BOC  2·AOC - 2·AOB  0. By 1.13, it implies that
BOC is either 0 or . It remains to apply 2.6 and Theorem 2.8 respectively in these two
cases.

2.12. Fix two points A and B provided by Axiom I.
     Fix a real number 0 <  < . By Axiom IIIa there is a point C such that ABC = .
     Use Proposition 2.2 to show that ABC is nondegenerate.

2.14. Applying Proposition 2.13, we get that AOC = BOD. It remains to apply
Axiom IV.

3.1. Set  = AOB and  = BOA. Note that  =  if and only if  = . Otherwise,
 = -. Hence the result.

3.3. Set  = ABC,  = ABC. Since 2·  2·, 1.13 implies that    or   +.
In the latter case, the angles have opposite signs which is impossible.

     Since ,   (-, ], equality    implies  = .

3.11. Note that O and A lie on the same side of (AB). Analogously O and B lie on the
same side of (AB). Hence the result.

3.13. Apply Theorem 3.7 for P QX and P QY and then apply Corollary 3.10a.

3.14. We can assume that A = B, C and B = A, C; otherwise, the statement trivially

holds.
     Note that (BB) does not intersect [AC]. Applying Pasch's theorem (3.12) for AAC

and (BB), we get that (BB) intersects [AA]; denote the point of intersection by M .
     In the same way, we get that (AA) intersects [BB]; that is, M lies on [AA] and

[BB].

3.15. Assume that Z is the point of intersection.
     Note that Z = P and Z = Q. Therefore, Z / (P Q).
     Show that Z and X lie on one side of (P Q). Repeat the argument to show that Z

and Y lie on one side of (P Q). It follows that X and Y lie on the same side of (P Q) a
contradiction.

3.20. The "only-if" part follows from the triangle inequality. To prove the "if" part,
observe that Theorem 3.17 implies the existence of a triangle with sides r1, r2, and d. Use
this triangle to show that there is a point X such that O1X = r1 and O2X = r2, where
O1 and O2 are the centers of the corresponding circles.

4.3. Apply Theorem 4.2 twice.

4.6. Consider the points D and D, such that M is the midpoint o [CD] and M  is the
midpoint of [CD]. Show that BCD = BCD and use it to prove that ABC =

4.7. (a) Apply SAS.

(b) Use (a) and apply SSS.

4.8. Without loss of generality, we may assume that X is distinct from A, B, and C. Set
f (X) = X; assume X = X.

     Note that AX = AX, BX = BX, and CX = CX. By SSS we get that ABX =
= ±ABX. Since X = X, we get that ABX  -ABX. In the same way, we get
that CBX  -CBX. Subtracting these two identities from each other, we get that

ABC  -ABC. Conclude that ABC = 0 or . That is, ABC is degenerate a

contradiction.

5.1. By Axiom IIIb and Theorem 2.8, we have XOA - XOB             X
 . Since |XOA|, |XOB| , we get that |XOA| +                            Y
+ |XOB| = . Hence the statement follows.

5.3. Assume X and A lie on the same side of .

Note that A and B lie on opposite sides of . Therefore, by

Corollary 3.10, [AX] does not intersect  and [BX] intersects ; A           B

suppose that Y denotes the intersection point.
180                                                                         HINTS

     Note that BX = AY + Y X AX. Since X / , by Theorem 5.2 we have BX = BA.
Therefore BX > AX.

     This way we proved the "if" part. To prove the "only if" part, you need to switch A
and B and repeat the above argument.

5.4. Apply 5.3, Theorem 4.1, and 3.3.

5.8. Choose an arbitrary nondegenerate triangle ABC. Suppose that A^B^C^ denotes its
image after the motion.

     If A = A^, apply the reflection across the perpendicular bisector of [AA^]. This reflection
sends A to A^. Let B and C denote the reflections of B and C respectively.

     If B = B^, apply the reflection across the perpendicular bisector of [BB^]. This reflec-
tion sends B to B^. Note that A^B^ = A^B; that is, A^ lies on the perpendicular bisector.
Therefore, A^ reflects to itself. Suppose that C denotes the reflection of C.

     Finally, if C = C^, apply the reflection across (A^B^). Note that A^C^ = A^C and B^C^ =
= B^C; that is, (AB) is the perpendicular bisector of [CC^]. Therefore, this reflection
sends C to C^.

     Apply 4.8 to show that the composition of the constructed reflections coincides with
the given motion.

5.9. Note that XBA = ABP , P BC = CBY . Therefore,

              XBY  XBP + P BY  2·(ABP + P BC)  2·ABC.

5.11. If ABC is right, the statement follows from Lemma 5.10.      C

Therefore, we can assume that ABC is obtuse.                             X

     Draw a line (BD) perpendicular to (BA). Since ABC is obtuse,     B          A
the angles DBA and DBC have opposite signs.
                                                                         D
     By Corollary 3.10, A and C lie on opposite sides of (BD). In
particular, [AC] intersects (BD) at a point; denote it by X.

Note that AX < AC and by Lemma 5.10, AB AX.

5.12. Let Y be the foot point of X on (AB). Apply Lemma 5.10 to               C
show that XY < AX AC < AB.                                            X

5.13. Let O be the center of the circle. Note that we can assume A       Y       B

that O = P .

Assume P lies between X and Y . By 5.1, we can assume that OP X is right or

obtuse. By 5.11, OP < OX; that is, P lies inside .

If P does not lie between X and Y , we can assume that X lies between P and Y . Since

OX = OY , 5.11 implies that OXY is acute. Therefore, OXP is obtuse. Applying 5.11

again we get that OP > OX; that is, P lies outside .

5.14. Apply Theorem 5.2.

5.16. Use 5.14 and Theorem 5.5.

5.18. Let P  be the reflection of P across (OO). Note that P  lies on both circles and
P  = P if and only if P / (OO).

5.19. Apply 5.18.

6.3. By the AA similarity condition, the transformation multiplies the sides of any non-
degenerate triangle by some number that may depend on the triangle.

     Note that for any two nondegenerate triangles that share one side this number is the
same. Applying this observation to a chain of triangles leads to a solution.

6.5. Apply that ADC  CDB.

6.6. Apply the Pythagorean theorem (6.4) and the SSS congruence condition.

Apply the SAS similarity condition to show that ABC  Y XC.

Similarly, apply AA and equality of vertical angles to prove that AZX  BZY

and use SAS to show that ABZ  Y XZ.

7.4. Apply Proposition 7.1 to show that k m. By Corollary 7.3, k n  m n. The
latter contradicts that m  n.

7.5. Repeat the construction in 5.22 twice.                                     B  Q

7.10. Since  (AC), it cannot cross [AC]. By Pasch's theorem (3.12),
 has to cross another side of ABC. Therefore  crosses [BC]; denote       A
the point of intersection by Q.

     Use the transversal property (7.9) to show that BAC = BP Q.
The same argument shows that ACB = P QB; it remains to apply
the AA similarity condition.

7.11. Assume we need to trisect segment [AB]. Construct a line  = (AB) with four
points A, C1, C2, C3 such that C1 and C2 trisect [AC3]. Draw the line (BC3) and draw
parallel lines thru C1 and C2. The points of intersections of these two lines with (AB)
trisect the segment [AB].

     Note that AOX is isosceles and OXC is right. Applying

7.12 and 4.2 and simplifying, you should get 4·CAX  .

     Show that CAX has to be acute. It follows then that
CAX = ± 4 .

                                                                                            A
7.17. Apply Theorem 7.12 to ABC and BDA.

7.19. Since ABC is isosceles, CAB = BCA.
     By SSS, ABC = CDA. Therefore, ±DCA = BCA = CAB.
     Since D = C, we get "-" in the last formula. Use the transversal property (7.9) to

show that (AB) (CD). Repeat the argument to show that (AD) (BC)

7.20. By Lemma 7.18 and SSS, AC = BD if and only if ABC = ±BCD. By the
transversal property (7.9), ABC + BCD  .

XP Y is vertical to XP Y . If P is outside of  then [P X) = [P X) and [P Y ) = [P Y ).
In both cases we have that XP Y = XP Y .

According to Theorem 3.7, Y XP and P Y X have the same sign; therefore Y XP =

9.21. Show that P lies on the arc opposite from ACB; conclude that AP C = CP B =

     Choose a point A  [P C] such that P A = P A. Note that AP A is equilateral.
Prove and use that AAC = AP B.

9.24. If C  (AX), then the arc is the line segment [AC] or the union of two half-lines in
(AX) with vertices at A and C.

     Assume C / (AX). Let  be the perpendicular line dropped from A to (AX) and m
be the perpendicular bisector of [AC].

     Note that   m; set O =   m. Note that the circle with center O passing thru A is
also passing thru C and tangent to (AX).

     Note that one of the two arcs with endpoints A and C is tangent to [AX).
     The uniqueness follows from 9.23.

9.25. Use 9.23 and 7.12 to show that XAY = ACY . By Axiom IIIc, ACY  0 as
AY  0; hence the result.

9.26. Apply Proposition 9.23 twice.
     (Alternatively, apply Corollary 5.7 for the reflection across the perpendicular bisector

of [AC].)

9.20. Guess a construction from the diagram. To show that it
produces the needed point, apply Theorem 9.2.

10.1. By Lemma 5.17, OT P  is right. Therefore, OP T 
 OT P  and in particular OP ·OP  = OT 2 and hence the re-
sult.

10.3. Suppose that O denotes the center of . Assume that

Note that the inversion sends X and Y to themselves. By Lemma 10.2,

     OP X  OXP  and OP Y  OY P .

Therefore, P X P X = OX OP = OY OP = P Y P Y and hence the result.
10.4. By Lemma 10.2,

     It remains to apply the theorem on the sum of angles of triangle (7.12) to show that
(AI)  (BC), (BI)  (CA) and (CI)  (BA).

10.5. Guess the construction from the diagram (the two non-
intersecting lines on the diagram are parallel).

10.8. First show that for any r > 0 and for any real numbers
x, y distinct from 0,

     r2 = r2 + r2 /2
     (x + y)/2   xy

if and only if x = y.
     Suppose that  denotes the line passing thru Q, Q, and the center of the inversion O.

Choose an isometry   R that sends O to 0; assume x, y  R are the values of  for the

two points of intersection   ; note that x = y. Assume r is the radius of the circle of
inversion. Then the left-hand side above is the coordinate of Q and the right-hand side
is the coordinate of the center of .

10.9. A solution is given on page 159.

10.10. Apply an inversion in a circle with the center at the only point of intersection of
the circles; then use Theorem 10.11.

10.13. Label the points of tangency by X, Y ,                                XX    AAAA

These points are images of A, B, X, and Y un-                       A           B

A, B, X, and Y also lie on one circline.

10.14. Apply the inversion in a circle with cen-
ter A. Point A will go to infinity, the two circles
tangent at A will become parallel lines and the
two parallel lines will become circles tangent at A; see the diagram.

It remains to show that the dashed line (AB) is parallel to the other two lines.

10.19. Apply Theorem 10.6b, 7.17 and Theorem 9.2.

10.20. Suppose that T denotes a point of intersection of 1 and 2. Let P be the foot
point of T on (O1O2). Show that O1P T  O1T O2  T P O2. Conclude that P
coincides with the inverses of O1 in 2 and of O2 in 1.

10.21. Since   1 and   2, Corollary 10.16 implies that the circles 1 and 2 are
inverted in  to themselves. Conclude that A and B are inverses of each other.

     Since 3  A, B, Corollary 10.17 implies that 3  .

10.22. Let P1 and P2 be the inverses of P in 1 and 2. Apply Corollary 10.17 and
Theorem 10.15 to show that a circline  that passes thru P , P1, and P3 is a solution.

10.23. All circles that perpendicular to 1 and 2 pass thru a fixed point P . Try to
construct P .

     If two of the circles intersect, try to apply Corollary 10.26.

11.2. Suppose that D denotes the midpoint of [BC]. Assume (AD) is the angle bisector
at A.

     Let A  [AD) be the point distinct from A such that AD = AD. Note that CAD =

11.3. The statement is evident if A, B, C, and D lie on one line.
     In the remaining case, suppose that O denotes the circumcenter. Apply theorem about

isosceles triangle (4.2) to the triangles AOB, BOC, COD, DOA.
     (Note that in the Euclidean plane the statement follows from Corollary 9.13 and 7.17,

but one cannot use these statements in the neutral plane.)

11.5. Arguing by contradiction, assume 2·(ABC + BCD)  0, but (AB)  (CD). Let
Z be the point of intersection of (AB) and (CD).

     Note that 2·ABC  2·ZBC, and 2·BCD  2·BCZ.
     Apply Proposition 11.4 to ZBC and try to arrive at a contradiction.

11.6. Let C  [BC) be the point such that BC = BC.
Note that by SAS, ABC = ABC. Conclude that

BCA = BCA.

Therefore, it is sufficient to show that C = C. If C =

contradiction.

Use it to show that CAB = ACD and ACB = CAD. By ASA, ABC = CDA,

12.1. Let A and B be the ideal points of the h-line . Note that the center of the Euclidean
circle containing  lies at the intersection of the lines tangent to the absolute at the ideal
points of .

12.2. Assume A is an ideal point of the h-line  and P  . Suppose that P  denotes the
inverse of P in the absolute. By Corollary 10.16,  lies in the intersection of the h-plane
and the (necessarily unique) circline passing thru P , A, and P .

12.3. Let  and O denote the absolute and its center.

     Let  be the circline containing [P Q]h. Note that [P Q]h = [P Q] if and only if  is a
line.

     Suppose that P  denotes the inverse of P in . Note that O, P , and P  lie on one line.
     By the definition of h-line,   . By Corollary 10.16,  passes thru P and P .

Therefore,  is a line if and only if it passes thru O.

12.4. Assume that the absolute is a unit circle.
     Set a = OX = OY . Note that 0 < a < 21 , OXh = ln 1-a 1+a , and XYh = ln (1-2·a)·(1+a) (1+2·a)·(1-a) .

It remains to check that the inequalities
                                            1 < 1-a 1+a < (1-2·a)·(1+a) (1+2·a)·(1-a)

hold if 0 < a < 21 .

It remains to show that all this implies 0 < p^ < p.

12.21. Look at the diagram and think.

12.24. By Corollary 10.26 and Theorem 10.6, the right-hand
sides in the identities survive under an inversion in a circle per-
pendicular to the absolute.

     As usual, we assume that the absolute is a unit circle. Sup-
pose that O denotes the h-midpoint of [P Q]h. By the main
observation (12.7) we can assume that O is the center of the
absolute. In this case, O is also the Euclidean midpoint of
[P Q].1

     Set a = OP = OQ; in this case, we have

                 P Q = 2·a,                                       P P  = QQ = a1 - a,
                P Q = 2· a1 ,                                     P Q = QP  = a1 + a.

and                                                  (1+a)2             1+a
     Therefore              P Qh = ln (1-a)2 = 2· ln 1-a .

        ch[ 21 ·P Qh] = 21 ·( 1-a 1+a + 1+a 1-a ) =                          P Q ·P Q 1a + a         =
                       = 1-a2 1+a2 ;                                                  =1

Hence the part (a) follows. Similarly,

        sh[ 21 ·P Qh] = 21 · 1-a 1+a - 1+a 1-a =                             P Q·P Q  =1    2        =
                       = 1-a2 2·a ;

                                                                                      = 1-a2 2·a .

Hence the part (b) follows.
     The parts (c) and (d) follow from (a), (b), the definition of hyperbolic tangent, and

the double-argument identity for hyperbolic cosine, see 12.23.

13.1; "only-if " part. Suppose  and m are ultraparallel; that                        D                    A

line with ideal points A and C intersects the h-line with ideal                         M O Ln

points B and D. Denote by O their point of intersection.

O is the h-midpoint of L and M . Note that in this case  is the reflection of m across O in
the Euclidean sense. It follows that the ideal points of the h-lines  and m are symmetric
to each other. Therefore, if one pair of them coincides, then so is the other pair. By 12.1,

13.3. By the triangle inequality, the h-distance from B to (AC)h is at least 50. It remains

to estimate |hABC| using Proposition 13.2. The inequalities cos          1 - 110 ·2 for

|| <       and  e3  > 10   should  help  to  finish  the  proof.

13.5. Note that the angle of parallelism of B to (CD)h is bigger than 4 , and it converges
to     as  C Dh   .

    Applying Proposition 13.2, we get that

                                             1 + 1

Therefore, ln 1 + 2 is the optimal upper bound.

13.6. As usual, we assume that the absolute is a unit

circle.                                                               Q PB
     Let P QR be a hyperbolic triangle with a right angle A

at Q, such that P Qh = QRh and the vertices P , Q, and

R lie on a horocycle.

    Without loss of generality, we may assume that Q

is the center of the absolute. In this case, hP QR =

    Note that Euclidean circle passing thru P , Q, and R is tangent to the absolute. Con-

clude that P Q = 12 . Apply 12.8 to find P Qh.

13.9. Apply AAA-congruence condition (13.8).

13.12. Apply Proposition 13.11. Use that the function r  e-r is decreasing and e > 2.

13.14. Apply the hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem and the definition of hyperbolic cosine.
The following observations should help:

      x  ex is an increasing positive function.

      By the triangle inequality, we have -c a - b and -c b - a.

14.1. Assume the two distinct lines  and m are mapped to the intersecting lines  and m.
Suppose that P  denotes their point of intersection.

     Let P be the inverse image of P . By the definition of affine map, it has to lie on both

14.3. In each case check that the map is a bijection and apply 7.24.

14.4. Choose a line (AB).

collinear points to collinear, the three lines (AB), (AX), and (BX) are
mapped to (AB). Further, any line that connects a pair of points on
these three lines is also mapped to (AB). Use it to show that the whole
plane is mapped to (AB). The latter contradicts that the map is a

bijection.
     By assumption, if X  (AB), then X  (AB). From above the

converse holds as well. Use it to prove the second statement.

14.5. According to the remark before the exercise, it is sufficient

14.6. Let O, E, A, and B denote the points with the coordinates AAAA
(0, 0), (1, 0), (a, 0), and (b, 0) respectively.

     To construct a point W with the coordinates (0, a + b), try to

construct two parallelograms OAP Q and BW P Q.
     To construct Z with coordinates (0, a·b) choose a line (OE) = (OE) and try to

construct the points A  (OE) and Z  (OE) so that OEE  OAA and OEB

14.7. Draw two parallel chords [XX] and [Y Y ]. Set Z = (XY )  (XY ) and Z =
= (XY )  (XY ). Note that (ZZ) passes thru the center.

     Repeat the same construction for another pair of parallel chords. The center lies in
the intersection of the obtained lines.

14.8. Assume a construction produces two perpendicular lines. Apply a shear map that
changes the angle between the lines (see 14.3a).

     Note that it transforms the construction to the same construction for other free choices
of points. Therefore, this construction does not produce perpendicular lines in general.
(It might produce a perpendicular line only by a coincidence.)

14.9. Apply twice 14.1 and the parallelogram rule. (Note that the case if A, B, X, and
Y are collinear requires extra work.)

     To prove (c), apply (a), (b), and Theorem 15.2.

15.6. Assume that (AB) meets (AB) at O. Since (AB) (BA), we get that OAB 

 OBA and OA =  OB .

Similarly, since (AC)        (C A ),  we  get  that  OA  =  OA OC .

Therefore  OB    =           Applying  the  SAS  similarity  condition,  we  get      that  OB C

The case (AB) (AB) is similar.

15.7. Observe that the statement is equivalent to Pappus' theorem.

15.8. To do (a), suppose that the parallelogram is formed by the two pairs of parallel lines
(AB) (AB) and (BC) (BC) and  = (AC) in the notation of Desargues' theorem

     To do (b), suppose that the parallelogram is formed by the two pairs of parallel lines
(AB) (AB) and (BC) (BC) and  = (AC) in the notation of Pappus' theorem

15.9. Draw a = (KN ), b = (KL), c = (LM ), d = (M N ), mark P = b  d, and continue.

15.10. Assume there is a duality. Choose two distinct parallel lines  and m. Let L and
M be their dual points. Set s = (M L), then its dual point S has to lie on both  and m

   a contradiction.

15.12. Assume M = (a, b) and the line s is given by the equation p·x + q·y = 1. Then
M  s is equivalent to p·a + q·b = 1.

     The latter is equivalent to m  S where m is the line given by the equation a·x+b·y = 1
and S = (p, q).

     To extend this bijection to the whole projective plane, assume that (1) the ideal line
corresponds to the origin and (2) the ideal point given by the pencil of the lines b·x-a·y = c
for different values of c corresponds to the line given by the equation a·x + b·y = 0.

15.14. Assume one set of concurrent lines a, b, c, and another

set of concurrent lines a, b, c are given. Set                               P

     P = b  c,      Q = c  a,                  R = a  b,
     P  = b  c,     Q = c  a,                  R = a  b.

Then the lines (P P ), (QQ), and (RR) are concurrent.                                 P

(AA), (BB), and (CC) are concurrent. Since (AA) (BB), we get that (AA)
  (BB) (CC).
     Now assume that P is the given point and (RQ), (P R) are the given parallel lines.

Try to construct point Q as in the dual Pappus' theorem (see the solution of 15.14).

15.17. Suppose p = (QR); denote by q and r the dual lines produced by the construction.
Then, by Claim 15.16, P is the point of intersection of q and r.

15.18. The line v polar to V is tangent to . Since V  p, by Claim 15.16, we get that
P  v; that is, (P V ) = v. Hence the statement follows.

15.19. Choose a point P outside of the bigger circle.      Y
Construct the lines dual to P for both circles. Note that                   X

Axiom p-III. Given a line , we can assume that A / ; otherwise, permute the labels of
the points. Then by axioms p-I and p-II, the three lines (AB), (AC), and (AD) intersect
 at distinct points. In particular,  contains at least three points.

15.22. Let A, B, C, and D be the point provided by Axiom p-III. Show that the lines
(AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) satisfy Axiom p-III. The proof of the converse is similar.

15.23. Let  be a line with n + 1 points on it.
     By Axiom p-III, given any line m, there is a point P that does not lie on  nor on m.
     By axioms p-I and p-II, there is a bijection between the lines passing thru P and the

points on . In particular, exactly n + 1 lines passing thru P .
     In the same way, there is a bijection between the lines passing thru P and the points

on m. Hence (a) follows.
     Fix a point X. By Axiom p-I, any point Y in the plane lies in a unique line passing

thru X. From part (a), each such line contains X and yet n point. Hence (b) follows.
     To solve (c), show that the equation n2 + n + 1 = 10 does not admit an integer solution

and then apply part (b).
     To solve (d), count the number of lines crossing a given line using the part (a) and

apply (b).

16.2. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we get that

                      cos ABs = cos ACs · cos BCs = 21 .

Therefore, ABs = 3 .

    Alternatively, look at the tessellation of a hemisphere              A     B

16.6. Consider the inversion of the base in a sphere with
the center at the tip of the cone and apply Theorem 16.3.

16.7. Note that points on  do not move. Moreover, the

points inside  are mapped outside of  and the other

way around.

     Further, note that this map sends circles to circles; moreover, the perpendicular circles

are mapped to perpendicular circles. In particular, the circles perpendicular to  are

mapped to themselves.
     Consider arbitrary point P / . Suppose that P  denotes the inverse of P in .

Choose two distinct circles that pass thru P and P . According to Corollary 10.17, 1  
and 2  .

     Therefore, the inversion in  sends 1 to itself, and the same holds for 2.
     The image of P has to lie on 1 and 2. Since the image of P is distinct from P , we
get that it has to be P .

17.1. Let N , O, S, P , P , and P^ be as on the diagram on page 136.

    Note  that    OQ     =   1  and   therefore    we  need  to  show
                             x
that OP^ = 2/(x + 1x ). To do this, show and use that
SOP  SP N  P P^P and 2·SO = N S.

17.3. Consider the bijection P  P^ of the h-plane with
absolute . Note that P^  [AiBi] if and only if P  i.

17.5. The observation follows since the reflection across
the perpendicular bisector of [P Q] is a motion of the Eu-
clidean plane, and a motion of the h-plane as well.

     Without loss of generality, we may assume that the
center of the circumcircle coincides with the center of the

It remains to apply Theorem 8.5.

17.6. Let ^ and m^ denote the h-lines in the conformal model that correspond to  and m.
We need to show that ^  m^ as arcs in the Euclidean plane.

     The point Z, where s meets t, is the center of the circle  containing ^.
     If m¯ is passing thru Z, then the inversion in  exchanges the ideal points of ^. In
particular, ^ maps to itself. Hence the result.

17.7. Let Q be the foot point of P on the line and 
be the angle of parallelism. We can assume that P is the
center of the absolute. Therefore P Q = cos  and

     Let X and Y are the ideal points of (BC)h. Applying the Pythagorean theorem (6.4)

The later means that | u-a b-a | = | b-v a-v | = | a-b w-b |, and arg b-a u-a = arg a-v b-v = arg a-b w-b . It implies
the first two equalities in

To show the uniqueness, assume there is another fractional linear transformation g(z)

that meets the conditions. Then the composition h = g  f -1 is a fractional linear trans-

formation; set h(z) = c·z+d a·z+b .
     Note that h() = ; therefore, c = 0. Further, h(0) = 0 implies b = 0. Finally, since

h(1) = 1,  we  get  that  a  = 1.      Therefore,  h  is  the  identity ;  that  is,  h(z) = z  for  any  z.   It

     By the definition of inversion, arg(z - w) = arg(z - w) and |z - w|·|z - w| = r2. It

Proposition 18.12 to show that f commutes with the inversion z  1/z¯. In other words,

1/f (z) = f (1/z¯) or                  c¯·z¯ + d¯ a/z¯ + b
                                       a¯·z¯ + ¯b = c/z¯ + d

for any z  C^ . The latter identity leads to the required statement. The condition |w| < |v|

18.21. Note that the inverses of the points z and w have complex coordinates 1/z¯ and

19.5. To construct a·b: (1) construct points A, B, and D  [AB] such that AD = a

and BD = b; (2) construct the circle  on the diameter [AB]; (3) draw the line  thru D
perpendicular to (AB); (4) let C be an intersection of  and . Then DC = a·b.

The construction of b is analogous.

19.7, (a). Look at the diagram; show that the angles marked the A                      X     C

same way have the same angle measure. Conclude that XC = BC

and ABC  AXB. Therefore

     AB = AX = AC - AB = AC - 1.
     AC AB                  AB       AB

It remains to solve for AB AC .
(b). Choose two points P and Q and use the compass-and-ruler calculator to construct
two points V and W such that V W = 1+ 5 2 ·P Q. Then construct a pentagon with the
sides P Q and diagonals V W .

19.8. Note that with a set-square we can construct a line parallel to a given line thru the
given point. It remains to modify the construction in 14.5.

19.10. Assume that two vertices have rational coordinates, say (a1, b1) and (a2, b2). Find
the coordinates of the third vertex. Use that the number 3 is irrational to show that the
third vertex is an irrational point.

19.11. Observe that three perpendiculars on the diagram meet at one                       A

point if and only if the triangle is isosceles. Use this observation couple

of times to verify that the given triangle is equilateral.

19.12. Consider the perspective projection (x, y)  ( x1 , xy ) (see
page 121). Let A = (1, 1), B = (3, 1), and M = (2, 1). Note that BB
                                                                                   BB        CC
M is the midpoint of [AB].                                                                   CC

     Their images are A = (1, 1), B = ( 13 , 13 ), and M  = ( 12 , 12 ). Clearly,
M  is not the midpoint of [AB].

19.14. The set of ruler and compass is strictly stronger than a set-square which is strictly
stronger than a ruler and parallel tool. To prove it, use exercises 5.22, 14.8, 19.10, and
Proposition 7.1.

20.1. Assume the contrary; that is, there is a point W  [XY ] such that W / ABC.
     Without loss of generality, we may assume that W and A lie on the opposite sides of

the line (BC).
     It implies that both segments [W X] and [W Y ] intersect (BC). By Axiom II, W  (BC)

   a contradiction.

20.3. To prove the "only if" part, consider the line passing thru the vertex that is parallel
to the opposite side.

     To prove the "if" part, use Pasch's theorem (3.12).

20.4. Assume the contrary; that is, a solid square Q can be presented as a union of a
finite collection of segments [A1B1], . . . , [AnBn] and one-point sets {C1}, . . . , {Ck}.

     Note that Q contains an infinite number of mutually nonparallel segments. There-
fore, we can choose a segment [P Q] in Q that is not parallel to any of the segments
[A1B1], . . . , [AnBn].

     It follows that [P Q] has at most one common point with each of the sets [AiBi]
and {Ci}. Since [P Q] contains an infinite number of points, we arrive at a contradiction.

20.5. Show that among elementary sets only one-point sets can be subsets of a circle. It
remains to note that any circle contains an infinite number of points.

20.13. Suppose that E denotes the point of intersection of the lines (BC) and (CD).
     Use Proposition 20.12 to prove the following two identities:

           area( ABED) = area( ABCD),                                                                  D D C E

           area( ABED) = area( ABCD).                                                                              C

20.15. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the angles                                   A B
                                                                                                            B
ABC and BCA are acute.
                                                                                                          C
Let A and B denote the foot points of A and B on (BC) and

(AC) respectively. Note that hA = AA and hB = BB.

Note that AAC  BBC; indeed the angle at C is shared                                                B A
                                                                     AA
and the angles at A  and B  are right.            In particular      BB        =  AC    or,
                                                                                  BC
equivalently, hA ·BC = hB ·AC.

                                                                                                   A               B

20.16. Draw the line  thru M parallel to [AB] and [CD]; it subdi-                                  D                  C
vides ABCD into two solid parallelograms which will be denoted
by ABEF and CDF E. In particular,

     area( ABCD) = area( ABEF ) + area( CDF E).                                                    F               E
By Proposition 20.12 and Theorem 20.14 we get that
                                                                                                   A         M     B

                        area(ABM )                =  1  ·  area(     ABEF ),
                                                     2

                        area(CDM )                =  1  ·  area(     CDF E)
                                                     2

and hence the result.

20.17. Let hA and hC denote the distances from A and C to the line (BD) respectively.
According to Theorem 20.14,

           area(ABM )  =    1  ·  hA  ·  B  M  ;              area(BCM )                =    1  ·  hC  ·  B  M  ;
                            2                                                                2

           area(CDM )  =    1  ·  hC  ·  D  M  ;              area(ABM )                =    1  ·  hA  ·  D  M  .
                            2                                                                2

Therefore

           area(ABM )· area(CDM )                 =     1  ·  hA  ·  hC  ·  D  M  ·  B  M  =
                                                        4

                                                  = area(BCM )· area(DAM ).

20.18. Let I be the incenter of ABC. Note that ABC can be subdivided into IAB,
IBC, and ICA.

     It remains to apply Theorem 20.14 to each of these triangles and sum up the results.

20.19. Fix a polygonal set P. Without loss of generality, we may assume that P is a
union of a finite collection of solid triangles. Cut P along the extensions of the sides of all
the triangles, it subdivides P into convex polygons. Cutting each polygon by diagonals
from one vertex produces a subdivision into solid triangles.
200                                                                                                                   HINTS

20.20. Assuming a > b, we subdivided Qc into Qa-b and four triangles congruent to T .
Therefore

                                      area Qc = area Qa-b + 4· area T .

    According to Theorem 20.14, area T          =     1  ·  a  ·  b  .  Therefore, the identity  can be written
                                                      2
as
                                          c2 = (a - b)2 + 2·a·b.

Simplifying, we get the Pythagorean theorem.
     Case a = b is simpler. Case b > a can be done in the same way.

20.21. If X is a point inside of ABC, then ABC is subdivided into ABX, BCX,
and CAX. Therefore

            area(ABX) + area(BCX) + area(CAX) = area(ABC).

     Set a = AB = BC = CA. Let h1, h2, and h3 denote the distances from X to the sides
[AB], [BC], and [CA]. Then by Theorem 20.14,

     area(AB X )  =  1  ·  h1  ·  a,      area(B C X )         =        1  ·  h2  ·  a,         area(C AX )  =  1  ·  h3  ·  a.
                     2                                                  2                                       2

Therefore,

                                      h1  + h2  + h3  =  2  ·     area(AB                C  ).
                                                         a

20.23. Apply Claim 20.22 to show that

     area(ABB) area(AXB) AB
                           =                    =  .                                                  A
     area(BCB) area(XCB ) B C
                                                                                                           B
And observe that                                                                                C

     area(ABB) = area(ABX) + area(AXB),                                                         X

     area(BCB) = area(BCX) + area(XCB). B A C

It implies the first identity; the rest is analogous.

20.24. To prove (a), apply Claim 20.22 twice to the trian-
gles OLiLj , OLj Mi, and OMiMj .

     To prove part (b), use Claim 20.22 to rewrite the left-hand side using the areas of
triangles OL1L2, OL2L3, OL3L4, and OL4L1. Further, use part (a) to rewrite it using
areas of OM1M2, OM2M3, OM3M4, and OM4M1 and apply Claim 20.22 again to get the
right-hand side.

20.25. Let Pn and Qn be the solid regular n-gons so that  is inscribed in Qn and

circumscribed around Pn. Clearly, Pn  D  Qn.
     Show that aarreeaa QPnn = (cos n )2; in particular,

                                          area Pn  1 as n  .
                                          area Qn

Next show that area Qn < 100, say for all n 100.
     These two statements imply that (area Qn - area Pn)  0. Hence the result.
