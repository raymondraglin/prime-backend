Scalars and Vectors

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      Describe the difference between vector and scalar quantities.
      Identify the magnitude and direction of a vector.
      Explain the effect of multiplying a vector quantity by a scalar.
      Describe how one-dimensional vector quantities are added or subtracted.
      Explain the geometric construction for the addition or subtraction of vectors in a
      plane.
      Distinguish between a vector equation and a scalar equation.

Many familiar physical quantities can be specified completely by giving a single
number and the appropriate unit. For example, "a class period lasts 50 min" or "the gas
tank in my car holds 65 L" or "the distance between two posts is 100 m." A physical
quantity that can be specified completely in this manner is called a scalar quantity.
Scalar is a synonym of "number." Time, mass, distance, length, volume, temperature,
and energy are examples of scalar quantities.

Scalar quantities that have the same physical units can be added or subtracted according
to the usual rules of algebra for numbers. For example, a class ending 10 min earlier
than 50 min lasts 50 min - 10 min = 40 min. Similarly, a 60-cal serving of corn
followed by a 200-cal serving of donuts gives 60 cal + 200 cal = 260 cal of energy.
When we multiply a scalar quantity by a number, we obtain the same scalar quantity but
with a larger (or smaller) value. For example, if yesterday's breakfast had 200 cal of
energy and today's breakfast has four times as much energy as it had yesterday, then
today's breakfast has 4(200 cal) = 800 cal of energy. Two scalar quantities can also be
multiplied or divided by each other to form a derived scalar quantity. For example, if a
train covers a distance of 100 km in 1.0 h, its speed is 100.0 km/1.0 h = 27.8 m/s, where
the speed is a derived scalar quantity obtained by dividing distance by time.

Many physical quantities, however, cannot be described completely by just a single
number of physical units. For example, when the U.S. Coast Guard dispatches a ship or
a helicopter for a rescue mission, the rescue team must know not only the distance to the
distress signal, but also the direction from which the signal is coming so they can get to
its origin as quickly as possible. Physical quantities specified completely by giving a
number of units (magnitude) and a direction are called vector quantities. Examples of
vector quantities include displacement, velocity, position, force, and torque. In the
language of mathematics, physical vector quantities are represented by mathematical
objects called vectors ([link]). We can add or subtract two vectors, and we can multiply
a vector by a scalar or by another vector, but we cannot divide by a vector. The
operation of division by a vector is not defined.
     We draw a vector from the initial point or
   origin (called the "tail" of a vector) to the end

      or terminal point (called the "head" of a
   vector), marked by an arrowhead. Magnitude

       is the length of a vector and is always a
      positive scalar quantity. (credit "photo":

Let's examine vector algebra using a graphical method to be aware of basic terms and to
develop a qualitative understanding. In practice, however, when it comes to solving
physics problems, we use analytical methods, which we'll see in the next section.
Analytical methods are more simple computationally and more accurate than graphical
methods. From now on, to distinguish between a vector and a scalar quantity, we adopt
the common convention that a letter in bold type with an arrow above it denotes a
vector, and a letter without an arrow denotes a scalar. For example, a distance of 2.0 km,
which is a scalar quantity, is denoted by d = 2.0 km, whereas a displacement of 2.0 km

in some direction, which is a vector quantity, is denoted by d .

Suppose you tell a friend on a camping trip that you have discovered a terrific fishing
hole 6 km from your tent. It is unlikely your friend would be able to find the hole easily
unless you also communicate the direction in which it can be found with respect to your
campsite. You may say, for example, "Walk about 6 km northeast from my tent." The
key concept here is that you have to give not one but two pieces of information--
namely, the distance or magnitude (6 km) and the direction (northeast).

Displacement is a general term used to describe a change in position, such as during a
trip from the tent to the fishing hole. Displacement is an example of a vector quantity. If
you walk from the tent (location A) to the hole (location B), as shown in [link], the

vector D  , representing your displacement, is drawn as the arrow that originates at point
 AandendsatpointB.Thearrowheadmarkstheendofthevector.Thedirectionofthe

displacement vector D  is the direction of the arrow. The length of the arrow represents
the magnitude D of vector D  . Here, D = 6 km. Since the magnitude of a vector is its

length, which is a positive number, the magnitude is also indicated by placing the
absolute value notation around the symbol that denotes the vector; so, we can write

equivalently that D  D  . To solve a vector problem graphically, we need to draw the
vector D  to scale. For example, if we assume 1 unit of distance (1 km) is represented in

the drawing by a line segment of length u = 2 cm, then the total displacement in this
example is represented by a vector of length d = 6u = 6(2 cm) = 12 cm, as shown in
[link]. Notice that here, to avoid confusion, we used D = 6 km to denote the magnitude
of the actual displacement and d = 12 cm to denote the length of its representation in the
drawing.

    The displacement vector from point A (the initial
       position at the campsite) to point B (the final
      position at the fishing hole) is indicated by an

     arrow with origin at point A and end at point B.
   The displacement is the same for any of the actual
    paths (dashed curves) that may be taken between

                        points A and B.
  A displacement D  of magnitude 6 km

   is drawn to scale as a vector of length
       12 cm when the length of 2 cm
      represents 1 unit of displacement
         (which in this case is 1 km).

Suppose your friend walks from the campsite at A to the fishing pond at B and then
walks back: from the fishing pond at B to the campsite at A. The magnitude of the

displacement vector D  AB from A to B is the same as the magnitude of the displacement
vector D  BA from B to A (it equals 6 km in both cases), so we can write DAB = DBA.
However, vector D  AB is not equal to vector D  BA because these two vectors have
different directions: D  AB  D  BA. In [link], vector D  BA would be represented by a
vector with an origin at point B and an end at point A, indicating vector D  BA points to
the southwest, which is exactly 180° opposite to the direction of vector D  AB. We say
that vector D  BA is antiparallel to vector D  AB and write D  AB = -D  BA, where the

minus sign indicates the antiparallel direction.

Two vectors that have identical directions are said to be parallel vectors--meaning,

they are parallel to each other. Two parallel vectors A  and B  are equal, denoted by
A  = B  , if and only if they have equal magnitudes A  = B  . Two vectors with

directions perpendicular to each other are said to be orthogonal vectors. These relations
between vectors are illustrated in [link].

   are parallel and have identical magnitudes A = B. (e) A   B

    their directions differ by 90°--meaning, they are orthogonal.

Algebra of Vectors in One Dimension

Vectors can be multiplied by scalars, added to other vectors, or subtracted from other
vectors. We can illustrate these vector concepts using an example of the fishing trip seen
in [link].

       Displacement vectors for a fishing trip. (a) Stopping to rest at point C while
   walking from camp (point A) to the pond (point B). (b) Going back for the dropped

                  tackle box (point D). (c) Finishing up at the fishing pond.
Suppose your friend departs from point A (the campsite) and walks in the direction to
point B (the fishing pond), but, along the way, stops to rest at some point C located
three-quarters of the distance between A and B, beginning from point A ([link](a)). What

is his displacement vector D  AC when he reaches point C? We know that if he walks all
the way to B, his displacement vector relative to A is D  AB, which has magnitude

DAB = 6 km and a direction of northeast. If he walks only a 0.75 fraction of the total
distance, maintaining the northeasterly direction, at point C he must be
0.75DAB = 4.5 km away from the campsite at A. So, his displacement vector at the
rest point C has magnitude DAC = 4.5 km = 0.75DAB and is parallel to the

displacement vector D  AB. All of this can be stated succinctly in the form of the

following vector equation:
Equation:

                                     DAC = 0.75DAB.

In a vector equation, both sides of the equation are vectors. The previous equation is an

example of a vector multiplied by a positive scalar (number)  = 0.75. The result, D  AC

, of such a multiplication is a new vector with a direction parallel to the direction of the

original vector D  AB.

In general, when a vector A  is multiplied by a positive scalar , the result is a new
vector B  that is parallel to A  :

Note:
Equation:

           B  = A  .

The magnitude B  of this new vector is obtained by multiplying the magnitude A  of

the original vector, as expressed by the scalar equation:
B = ||A.Note:

In a scalar equation, both sides of the equation are numbers. [link] is a scalar equationEquation:

because the magnitudes of vectors are scalar quantities (and positive numbers). If the

scalar  is negative in the vector equation [link], then the magnitude B  of the new

vector is still given by [link], but the direction of the new vector B  is antiparallel to the
direction of A  . These principles are illustrated in [link](a) by two examples where the
length of vector A  is 1.5 units. When  = 2, the new vector B  = 2A  has length

B = 2A = 3.0 units (twice as long as the original vector) and is parallel to the original

vector. When  = -2, the new vector C  = -2A  has length C = | - 2|A = 3.0 units

(twice as long as the original vector) and is antiparallel to the original vector.

(b) Addition of two vectors (R  is called the resultant of vectors A 
  and B  ). (c) Subtraction of two vectors (D  is the difference of

The vector sum of two (or more) vectors is called the resultant vector or, for short, the
resultant. When the vectors on the right-hand-side of [link] are known, we can find thethe campsite and finds the box lying on the path at some point D only 1.2 km away from

resultant D  AD as follows:point C (see [link](b)). What is his displacement vector D  AD when he finds the box at
point D? What is his displacement vector D  DB from point D to the hole? We have
Equation:already established that at rest point C his displacement vector is D  AC = 0.75D  AB.

         DAD = DAC + DCD = 0.75DAB - 0.2 DAB = (0.75 - 0.2)DAB = 0.55DAB.Starting at point C, he walks southwest (toward the campsite), which means his new

When your friend finally reaches the pond at B, his displacement vector D  AB fromdisplacement vector D  CD from point C to point D is antiparallel to D  AB. Its magnitude
point A is the vector sum of his displacement vector D  AD from point A to point D andD  CD is DCD = 1.2 km = 0.2DAB, so his second displacement vector is
his displacement vector D  DB from point D to the fishing hole: D  AB = D  AD + D  DB
(see [link](c)). This means his displacement vector D  DB is the difference of twoD  CD = -0.2D  AB. His total displacement D  AD relative to the campsite is the vector
sum of the two displacement vectors: vector D  AC (from the campsite to the rest point)
vectors:and vector D  CD (from the rest point to the point where he finds his box):
Equation:

                           DDB = DAB - DAD = DAB + (-DAD).

Notice that a difference of two vectors is nothing more than a vector sum of two vectors

because  the  second  term  in  [link]  is  vector         (which  is  antiparallel  to  D  AD).

                                                    -D AD

When we substitute [link] into [link], we obtain the second displacement vector:

Equation:

D  DB = D  AB - D  AD = D  AB -  0.55DAB = (1.0 -  0.55)DAB =  0.45DAB.

This result means your friend walked DDB = 0.45DAB = 0.45(6.0 km) = 2.7 km
from the point where he finds his tackle box to the fishing hole.

When vectors A  and B  lie along a line (that is, in one dimension), such as in the
camping example, their resultant R  = A  + B  and their difference D  = A  - B  both

lie along the same direction. We can illustrate the addition or subtraction of vectors by
drawing the corresponding vectors to scale in one dimension, as shown in [link].

To illustrate the resultant when A  and B  are two parallel vectors, we draw them along

one line by placing the origin of one vector at the end of the other vector in head-to-tail
fashion (see [link](b)). The magnitude of this resultant is the sum of their magnitudes: R

= A + B. The direction of the resultant is parallel to both vectors. When vector A  is
antiparallel to vector B  , we draw them along one line in either head-to-head fashion

([link](c)) or tail-to-tail fashion. The magnitude of the vector difference, then, is the
absolute value D = |A - B| of the difference of their magnitudes. The direction of the

difference vector D  is parallel to the direction of the longer vector.

In general, in one dimension--as well as in higher dimensions, such as in a plane or in
space--we can add any number of vectors and we can do so in any order because the
addition of vectors is commutative,

Note:
Equation:

                                        A  + B  = B  + A  ,
and associative,

Note:
Equation:

                  (A  + B  ) + C  = A  + (B  + C  ).

Moreover, multiplication by a scalar is distributive:

Note:
Equation:

                     1A + 2A = (1 + 2)A.

We used the distributive property in [link] and [link].

When adding many vectors in one dimension, it is convenient to use the concept of a
unit vector. A unit vector, which is denoted by a letter symbol with a hat, such as u ^, has
a magnitude of one and does not have any physical unit so that u ^  u = 1. The only

role of a unit vector is to specify direction. For example, instead of saying vector D  AB

has a magnitude of 6.0 km and a direction of northeast, we can introduce a unit vector u ^

that points to the northeast and say succinctly that D  AB = (6.0 km)u ^. Then the

southwesterly direction is simply given by the unit vector -u ^. In this way, the
displacement of 6.0 km in the southwesterly direction is expressed by the vector
Equation:

                                 DBA = (-6.0 km)u ^.

Example:
A Ladybug Walker
A long measuring stick rests against a wall in a physics laboratory with its 200-cm end
at the floor. A ladybug lands on the 100-cm mark and crawls randomly along the stick.
It first walks 15 cm toward the floor, then it walks 56 cm toward the wall, then it walks
3 cm toward the floor again. Then, after a brief stop, it continues for 25 cm toward the
floor and then, again, it crawls up 19 cm toward the wall before coming to a complete
rest ([link]). Find the vector of its total displacement and its final resting position on the
stick.
Strategy
If we choose the direction along the stick toward the floor as the direction of unit vector
u ^, then the direction toward the floor is +u ^ and the direction toward the wall is -u ^.
The ladybug makes a total of five displacements:
Equation:

                              D1 = (15 cm)(+u ^),
                              D2 = (56 cm)(-u ^),
                              D3 = (3 cm)(+u ^),
                              D4 = (25 cm)(+u ^), and
                              D5 = (19 cm)(-u ^).

The total displacement D  is the resultant of all its displacement vectors.
      Five displacements of the ladybug. Note that in this schematic drawing,
      magnitudes of displacements are not drawn to scale. (credit "ladybug":

        modification of work by "Persian Poet Gal"/Wikimedia Commons)

Solution
The resultant of all the displacement vectors is
Equation:

D  = D  1 + D  2 + D  3 + D  4 + D  5

          = (15 cm)(+u ^) + (56 cm)(-u ^) + (3 cm)(+u ^) + (25 cm)(+u ^) + (19 cm)(-u ^)

          = (15 - 56 + 3 + 25 - 19)cmu ^

          = -32 cmu ^.

In this calculation, we use the distributive law given by [link]. The result reads that the
total displacement vector points away from the 100-cm mark (initial landing site)
toward the end of the meter stick that touches the wall. The end that touches the wall is
marked 0 cm, so the final position of the ladybug is at the (100 - 32)cm = 68-cm mark.

Algebra of Vectors in Two Dimensions

When vectors lie in a plane--that is, when they are in two dimensions--they can be
multiplied by scalars, added to other vectors, or subtracted from other vectors in
accordance with the general laws expressed by [link], [link], [link], and [link]. However,
the addition rule for two vectors in a plane becomes more complicated than the rule for
vector addition in one dimension. We have to use the laws of geometry to construct
resultant vectors, followed by trigonometry to find vector magnitudes and directions.
This geometric approach is commonly used in navigation ([link]). In this section, we
need to have at hand two rulers, a triangle, a protractor, a pencil, and an eraser for
drawing vectors to scale by geometric constructions.
     In navigation, the laws of geometry are used to draw resultant displacements on
                                            nautical maps.

For a geometric construction of the sum of two vectors in a plane, we follow the

parallelogram rule. Suppose two vectors A  and B  are at the arbitrary positions shown

in [link]. Translate either one of them in parallel to the beginning of the other vector, so
that after the translation, both vectors have their origins at the same point. Now, at the

end of vector A  we draw a line parallel to vector B  and at the end of vector B  we draw
a line parallel to vector A  (the dashed lines in [link]). In this way, we obtain a

parallelogram. From the origin of the two vectors we draw a diagonal that is the

resultant R  of the two vectors: R  = A  + B  ([link](a)). The other diagonal of this
parallelogram is the vector difference of the two vectors D  = A  - B  , as shown in
[link](b). Notice that the end of the difference vector is placed at the end of vector A  .
         The parallelogram rule for the addition of two vectors. Make the parallel
        translation of each vector to a point where their origins (marked by the dot)
   coincide and construct a parallelogram with two sides on the vectors and the other
   two sides (indicated by dashed lines) parallel to the vectors. (a) Draw the resultant

    vector R  along the diagonal of the parallelogram from the common point to the

      opposite corner. Length R of the resultant vector is not equal to the sum of the

   magnitudes of the two vectors. (b) Draw the difference vector D  = A  - B  along
   the diagonal connecting the ends of the vectors. Place the origin of vector D  at the

     end of vector B  and the end (arrowhead) of vector D  at the end of vector A  .

     Length D of the difference vector is not equal to the difference of magnitudes of
                                            the two vectors.

It follows from the parallelogram rule that neither the magnitude of the resultant vector
nor the magnitude of the difference vector can be expressed as a simple sum or
difference of magnitudes A and B, because the length of a diagonal cannot be expressed
as a simple sum of side lengths. When using a geometric construction to find

magnitudes R  and D  , we have to use trigonometry laws for triangles, which may

lead to complicated algebra. There are two ways to circumvent this algebraic
complexity. One way is to use the method of components, which we examine in the next
section. The other way is to draw the vectors to scale, as is done in navigation, and read
approximate vector lengths and angles (directions) from the graphs. In this section we
examine the second approach.

If we need to add three or more vectors, we repeat the parallelogram rule for the pairs of
vectors until we find the resultant of all of the resultants. For three vectors, for example,
we first find the resultant of vector 1 and vector 2, and then we find the resultant of this
resultant and vector 3. The order in which we select the pairs of vectors does not matter
because the operation of vector addition is commutative and associative (see [link] and
[link]). Before we state a general rule that follows from repetitive applications of the
parallelogram rule, let's look at the following example.
Suppose you plan a vacation trip in Florida. Departing from Tallahassee, the state
capital, you plan to visit your uncle Joe in Jacksonville, see your cousin Vinny in
Daytona Beach, stop for a little fun in Orlando, see a circus performance in Tampa, and
visit the University of Florida in Gainesville. Your route may be represented by five

displacement vectors A  , B  , C  , D  , and E , which are indicated by the red vectors in

[link]. What is your total displacement when you reach Gainesville? The total
displacement is the vector sum of all five displacement vectors, which may be found by
using the parallelogram rule four times. Alternatively, recall that the displacement
vector has its beginning at the initial position (Tallahassee) and its end at the final
position (Gainesville), so the total displacement vector can be drawn directly as an
arrow connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville (see the green vector in [link]). When we

use the parallelogram rule four times, the resultant R  we obtain is exactly this green
vector connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville: R  = A  + B  + C  + D  + E  .

      When we use the parallelogram rule four times, we obtain the resultant vector

    R  = A  + B  + C  + D  + E  , which is the green vector connecting Tallahassee

                                           with Gainesville.
Drawing the resultant vector of many vectors can be generalized by using the following

tail-to-head geometric construction. Suppose we want to draw the resultant vector R 
of four vectors A  , B  , C  , and D  ([link](a)). We select any one of the vectors as the first

vector and make a parallel translation of a second vector to a position where the origin
("tail") of the second vector coincides with the end ("head") of the first vector. Then, we
select a third vector and make a parallel translation of the third vector to a position
where the origin of the third vector coincides with the end of the second vector. We
repeat this procedure until all the vectors are in a head-to-tail arrangement like the one

shown in [link]. We draw the resultant vector R  by connecting the origin ("tail") of the

first vector with the end ("head") of the last vector. The end of the resultant vector is at
the end of the last vector. Because the addition of vectors is associative and
commutative, we obtain the same resultant vector regardless of which vector we choose
to be first, second, third, or fourth in this construction.

  Tail-to-head method for drawing the resultant vector R  = A  + B  + C  + D  .

   (a) Four vectors of different magnitudes and directions. (b) Vectors in (a) are
   translated to new positions where the origin ("tail") of one vector is at the end

      ("head") of another vector. The resultant vector is drawn from the origin
        ("tail") of the first vector to the end ("head") of the last vector in this
                                          arrangement.

Example:
Geometric Construction of the Resultant

The three displacement vectors A  , B  , and C  in [link] are specified by their magnitudes

A = 10.0, B = 7.0, and C = 8.0, respectively, and by their respective direction angles
with the horizontal direction  = 35°,  = -110°, and  = 30°. The physical units
of the magnitudes are centimeters. Choose a convenient scale and use a ruler and a

protractor to find the following vector sums: (a) R  = A  + B  , (b) D  = A  - B  , and
(c) S  = A  - 3B  + C  .

Strategy
In geometric construction, to find a vector means to find its magnitude and its direction
angle with the horizontal direction. The strategy is to draw to scale the vectors that
appear on the right-hand side of the equation and construct the resultant vector. Then,
use a ruler and a protractor to read the magnitude of the resultant and the direction
angle. For parts (a) and (b) we use the parallelogram rule. For (c) we use the tail-to-
head method.
Solution

For parts (a) and (b), we attach the origin of vector B  to the origin of vector A  , as

shown in [link], and construct a parallelogram. The shorter diagonal of this

parallelogram is the sum A  + B  . The longer of the diagonals is the difference A  - B  .

We use a ruler to measure the lengths of the diagonals, and a protractor to measure the

angles with the horizontal. For the resultant R  , we obtain R = 5.8 cm and R  0°. For
the difference D  , we obtain D = 16.2 cm and D = 49.3°, which are shown in [link].

                                   (finding the difference, blue).

For (c), we can start with vector -3B  and draw the remaining vectors tail-to-head as

shown in [link]. In vector addition, the order in which we draw the vectors is

unimportant, but drawing the vectors to scale is very important. Next, we draw vector S 

from the origin of the first vector to the end of the last vector and place the arrowhead

at the end of S . We use a ruler to measure the length of S , and find that its magnitude is

S = 36.9 cm. We use a protractor and find that its direction angle is S = 52.9°. This
solution is shown in [link].

Summary

      A vector quantity is any quantity that has magnitude and direction, such as
      displacement or velocity. Vector quantities are represented by mathematical objects
      called vectors.
      Geometrically, vectors are represented by arrows, with the end marked by an
      arrowhead. The length of the vector is its magnitude, which is a positive scalar. On
      a plane, the direction of a vector is given by the angle the vector makes with a
      reference direction, often an angle with the horizontal. The direction angle of a
      vector is a scalar.
      Two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same magnitudes and directions.
      Parallel vectors have the same direction angles but may have different magnitudes.
      Antiparallel vectors have direction angles that differ by 180°. Orthogonal vectors
      have direction angles that differ by 90°.
      When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, the result is another vector of a different
      length than the length of the original vector. Multiplication by a positive scalar
      does not change the original direction; only the magnitude is affected.
      Multiplication by a negative scalar reverses the original direction. The resulting
      vector is antiparallel to the original vector. Multiplication by a scalar is distributive.
      Vectors can be divided by nonzero scalars but cannot be divided by vectors.
      Two or more vectors can be added to form another vector. The vector sum is called
      the resultant vector. We can add vectors to vectors or scalars to scalars, but we
      cannot add scalars to vectors. Vector addition is commutative and associative.
      To construct a resultant vector of two vectors in a plane geometrically, we use the
      parallelogram rule. To construct a resultant vector of many vectors in a plane
      geometrically, we use the tail-to-head method.

Coordinate Systems and Components of a Vector

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      Describe vectors in two and three dimensions in terms of their components, using unit vectors
      along the axes.
      Distinguish between the vector components of a vector and the scalar components of a vector.
      Explain how the magnitude of a vector is defined in terms of the components of a vector.
      Identify the direction angle of a vector in a plane.
      Explain the connection between polar coordinates and Cartesian coordinates in a plane.

Vectors are usually described in terms of their components in a coordinate system. Even in
everyday life we naturally invoke the concept of orthogonal projections in a rectangular coordinate
system. For example, if you ask someone for directions to a particular location, you will more
likely be told to go 40 km east and 30 km north than 50 km in the direction 37° north of east.

In a rectangular (Cartesian) xy-coordinate system in a plane, a point in a plane is described by a

pair of coordinates (x, y). In a similar fashion, a vector A  in a plane is described by a pair of its
vector coordinates. The x-coordinate of vector A  is called its x-component and the y-coordinate of
vector A  is called its y-component. The vector x-component is a vector denoted by A  x. The
vector y-component is a vector denoted by A  y. In the Cartesian system, the x and y vector

components of a vector are the orthogonal projections of this vector onto the x- and y-axes,
respectively. In this way, following the parallelogram rule for vector addition, each vector on a
Cartesian plane can be expressed as the vector sum of its vector components:
Equation:

                                         A  = A  x + A  y.

As illustrated in [link], vector A  is the diagonal of the rectangle where the x-component A  x is the
side parallel to the x-axis and the y-component A  y is the side parallel to the y-axis. Vector
component A  x is orthogonal to vector component A  y.
    Vector A  in a plane in the Cartesian coordinate system is the

     vector sum of its vector x- and y-components. The x-vector

    component A  x is the orthogonal projection of vector A  onto
      the x-axis. The y-vector component A  y is the orthogonal

    projection of vector A  onto the y-axis. The numbers Ax and

     Ay that multiply the unit vectors are the scalar components

                                of the vector.

It  is  customary  to  denote  the  positive  direction  on   the  x-axis            by   the  unit  vector   ^  and  the  positive
                                                                                                              i

direction  on  the  y-axis  by  the  unit  vector  ^j.  Unit  vectors            of  the  axes,  ^  and  ^j,  define  two
                                                                                                 i

orthogonal directions in the plane. As shown in [link], the x- and y- components of a vector can

now be written in terms of the unit vectors of the axes:

Equation:

                                                     ^

                                                        Ax = Axi

                                                    {
                                                                              ^
                                                       Ay = Ay j.

The vectors A  x and A  y defined by [link] are the vector components of vector A  . The numbers
Ax and Ay that define the vector components in [link] are the scalar components of vector A  .

Combining [link] with [link], we obtain the component form of a vector:

Note:
Equation:

                                                   ^       ^
                                           A = Ax i + Ay j.

If we know the coordinates b(xb, yb) of the origin point of a vector (where b stands for
"beginning") and the coordinates e(xe, ye) of the end point of a vector (where e stands for "end"),
we can obtain the scalar components of a vector simply by subtracting the origin point coordinates
from the end point coordinates:

Note:
Equation:

                                                       Ax = xe - xb
                                                   {

                                                       Ay = ye - yb.

Example:
Displacement of a Mouse Pointer
A mouse pointer on the display monitor of a computer at its initial position is at point (6.0 cm, 1.6
cm) with respect to the lower left-side corner. If you move the pointer to an icon located at point
(2.0 cm, 4.5 cm), what is the displacement vector of the pointer?
Strategy
The origin of the xy-coordinate system is the lower left-side corner of the computer monitor.

Therefore,  the  unit  vector  ^  on  the  x-axis  points  horizontally  to  the  right  and  the  unit  vector  ^  on
                               i                                                                                 j

the y-axis points vertically upward. The origin of the displacement vector is located at point b(6.0,

1.6) and the end of the displacement vector is located at point e(2.0, 4.5). Substitute the

coordinates of these points into [link] to find the scalar components Dx and Dy of the

displacement vector D  . Finally, substitute the coordinates into [link] to write the displacement

vector in the vector component form.

Solution

We identify xb = 6.0, xe = 2.0, yb = 1.6, and ye = 4.5, where the physical unit is 1 cm. The

scalar x- and y-components of the displacement vector are

Equation:

                       Dx             = xe - xb = (2.0 - 6.0)cm = -4.0 cm,
                       Dy             = ye - yb = (4.5 - 1.6)cm = +2.9 cm.

The vector component form of the displacement vector is
Equation:

                 ^                    ^            ^                  ^           ^           ^
                 D = Dxi + Dyj = (-4.0 cm)i + (2.9 cm)j = (-4.0i + 2.9j)cm.
This solution is shown in [link].

     The graph of the displacement vector. The vector points from the
                     origin point at b to the end point at e.

Significance

Notice that the physical unit--here, 1 cm--can be placed either with each component

immediately before the unit vector or globally for both components, as in [link]. Often, the latter

way is more convenient because it is simpler.

The   vector  x-component  D  x  =             ^  =                ^   of  the  displacement  vector  has  the  magnitude
                                    -4.0i            4.0(-i)

D  x =      - 4.0   ^  = 4.0 because the magnitude of the unit vector is                      ^  = 1. Notice, too, that
                    i                                                                         i

the direction of the x-component is -^i, which is antiparallel to the direction of the +x-axis; hence,

the x-component vector D  x points to the left, as shown in [link]. The scalar x-component of

vector D  is Dx = -4.0.

Similarly,  the  vector  y-component  D  y        =             ^  of  the  displacement  vector  has  magnitude
                                                     +2.9j

D  y  =  2.9     ^  = 2.9 because the magnitude of the unit vector is                     ^   = 1. The direction of the
                 j                                                                        j

y-component is +^j, which is parallel to the direction of the +y-axis. Therefore, the y-component

vector D  y points up, as seen in [link]. The scalar y-component of vector D  is Dy = +2.9. The
displacement vector D  is the resultant of its two vector components.

The vector component form of the displacement vector [link] tells us that the mouse pointer has

been moved on the monitor 4.0 cm to the left and 2.9 cm upward from its initial position.

When we know the scalar components Ax and Ay of a vector A  , we can find its magnitude A and

its direction angle A. The direction angle--or direction, for short--is the angle the vector forms
with the positive direction on the x-axis. The angle A is measured in the counterclockwise
direction from the +x-axis to the vector ([link]). Because the lengths A, Ax, and Ay form a right
triangle, they are related by the Pythagorean theorem:

Note:
Equation:

                                     2         2      2        A = A2 + A2.

                                     A = Ax + Ay                              x    y

This equation works even if the scalar components of a vector are negative. The direction angle A
of a vector is defined via the tangent function of angle A in the triangle shown in [link]:

Note:
Equation:

                                                      tan  =   Ay
                                                               Ax
     When the vector lies either in the first quadrant or in the
     fourth quadrant, where component Axis positive (Figure
    2.19), the direction angle A in Equation 2.16) is identical

                               to the angle .

When the vector lies either in the first quadrant or in the fourth quadrant, where component Ax is
positive ([link]), the angle  in [link] is identical to the direction angle A. For vectors in the
fourth quadrant, angle  is negative, which means that for these vectors, direction angle A is
measured clockwise from the positive x-axis. Similarly, for vectors in the second quadrant, angle 
is negative. When the vector lies in either the second or third quadrant, where component Ax is
negative, the direction angle is A =  + 180° ([link]).
Scalar components of a vector may be positive or negative. Vectors
 in the first quadrant (I) have both scalar components positive and
vectors in the third quadrant have both scalar components negative.
For vectors in quadrants II and III, the direction angle of a vector is

                              A =  + 180°.

Magnitude and Direction of the Displacement Vector
You move a mouse pointer on the display monitor from its initial position at point (6.0 cm, 1.6
cm) to an icon located at point (2.0 cm, 4.5 cm). What are the magnitude and direction of the
displacement vector of the pointer?
Strategy

In [link], we found the displacement vector D  of the mouse pointer (see [link]). We identify its

scalar components Dx = -4.0 cm and Dy = +2.9 cm and substitute into [link] and [link] to

find the magnitude D and direction D, respectively.
Solution

The magnitude of vector D  is

Equation:

D = D2 + D2 =  2 2 (-4.0 cm) + (2.9 cm) =  2 2 (4.0) + (2.9) cm = 4.9 cm.

                  Dx        -4.0 cm

Vector D  lies in the second quadrant, so its direction angle is

Equation:

                         D =  + 180° = -35.9° + 180° = 144.1°.

In many applications, the magnitudes and directions of vector quantities are known and we need to
find the resultant of many vectors. For example, imagine 400 cars moving on the Golden Gate
Bridge in San Francisco in a strong wind. Each car gives the bridge a different push in various
directions and we would like to know how big the resultant push can possibly be. We have already
gained some experience with the geometric construction of vector sums, so we know the task of
finding the resultant by drawing the vectors and measuring their lengths and angles may become
intractable pretty quickly, leading to huge errors. Worries like this do not appear when we use
analytical methods. The very first step in an analytical approach is to find vector components
when the direction and magnitude of a vector are known.

Let us return to the right triangle in [link]. The quotient of the adjacent side Ax to the hypotenuse
A is the cosine function of direction angle A, Ax/A = cos A, and the quotient of the opposite
side Ay to the hypotenuse A is the sine function of A, Ay/A = sin A. When magnitude A and
direction A are known, we can solve these relations for the scalar components:

Note:
Equation:
                                             Ax = A cos A

   {                                                       .

                                             Ay = A sin A

When calculating vector components with [link], care must be taken with the angle. The direction
angle A of a vector is the angle measured counterclockwise from the positive direction on the x-
axis to the vector. The clockwise measurement gives a negative angle.

Example:
Components of Displacement Vectors
A rescue party for a missing child follows a search dog named Trooper. Trooper wanders a lot
and makes many trial sniffs along many different paths. Trooper eventually finds the child and the
story has a happy ending, but his displacements on various legs seem to be truly convoluted. On
one of the legs he walks 200.0 m southeast, then he runs north some 300.0 m. On the third leg, he
examines the scents carefully for 50.0 m in the direction 30° west of north. On the fourth leg,
Trooper goes directly south for 80.0 m, picks up a fresh scent and turns 23° west of south for
150.0 m. Find the scalar components of Trooper's displacement vectors and his displacement
vectors in vector component form for each leg.
Strategy
Let's adopt a rectangular coordinate system with the positive x-axis in the direction of geographic

east, with the positive y-direction pointed to geographic north. Explicitly, the unit vector ^i of the

x-axis points east and the unit vector ^j of the y-axis points north. Trooper makes five legs, so there
are five displacement vectors. We start by identifying their magnitudes and direction angles, then
we use [link] to find the scalar components of the displacements and [link] for the displacement
vectors.
Solution
On the first leg, the displacement magnitude is L1 = 200.0 m and the direction is southeast. For
direction angle 1 we can take either 45° measured clockwise from the east direction or
45° + 270° measured counterclockwise from the east direction. With the first choice,
1 = -45°. With the second choice, 1 = +315°. We can use either one of these two angles.
The components are
Equation:

L1x = L1 cos 1 = (200.0 m) cos 315° = 141.4 m,
L1y = L1 sin 1 = (200.0 m) sin 315° = -141.4 m.

The displacement vector of the first leg is
Equation:

^                                            ^  ^             ^
L1 = L1x i + L1y j = (141.4i - 141.4j) m.

On the second leg of Trooper's wanderings, the magnitude of the displacement is L2 = 300.0 m
and the direction is north. The direction angle is 2 = +90°. We obtain the following results:
Equation:
L2x = L2 cos 2 = (300.0 m) cos 90° = 0.0 ,

L2y = L2 sin 2 = (300.0 m) sin 90° = 300.0 m,

^     ^     ^
L2 = L2x i + L2y j = (300.0 m)j.

On the third leg, the displacement magnitude is L3 = 50.0 m and the direction is 30° west of
north. The direction angle measured counterclockwise from the eastern direction is
3 = 30° + 90° = +120°. This gives the following answers:
Equation:

L3x = L3 cos 3 = (50.0 m) cos 120° = -25.0 m,

L3y = L3 sin 3 = (50.0 m) sin 120° = +43.3 m,

^  ^     ^                        ^
L3 = L3x i + L3y j = (-25.0i + 43.3j)m.

On the fourth leg of the excursion, the displacement magnitude is L4 = 80.0 m and the direction
is south. The direction angle can be taken as either 4 = -90° or 4 = +270°. We obtain
Equation:

L4x = L4 cos 4 = (80.0 m) cos (-90°) = 0 ,

L4y = L4 sin 4 = (80.0 m) sin (-90°) = -80.0 m,

^  ^        ^
L4 = L4x i + L4y j = (-80.0 m)j.

On the last leg, the magnitude is L5 = 150.0 m and the angle is 5 = -23° + 270° = +247°
(23° west of south), which gives
Equation:

L5x = L5 cos 5 = (150.0 m) cos 247° = -58.6 m,

L5y = L5 sin 5 = (150.0 m) sin 247° = -138.1 m,

^  ^     ^                        ^

Polar Coordinates

To describe locations of points or vectors in a plane, we need two orthogonal directions. In the

Cartesian  coordinate  system  these  directions  are  given  by  unit  vectors  ^  and  ^  along  the  x-axis  and
                                                                                 i       j

the y-axis, respectively. The Cartesian coordinate system is very convenient to use in describing

displacements and velocities of objects and the forces acting on them. However, it becomes

cumbersome when we need to describe the rotation of objects. When describing rotation, we

usually work in the polar coordinate system.

In the polar coordinate system, the location of point P in a plane is given by two polar
coordinates ([link]). The first polar coordinate is the radial coordinate r, which is the distance of
point P from the origin. The second polar coordinate is an angle  that the radial vector makes
with some chosen direction, usually the positive x-direction. In polar coordinates, angles are
measured in radians, or rads. The radial vector is attached at the origin and points away from the
origin to point P. This radial direction is described by a unit radial vector ^r. The second unit vector

^t is a vector orthogonal to the radial direction ^r. The positive +^t direction indicates how the angle
 changes in the counterclockwise direction. In this way, a point P that has coordinates (x, y) in
the rectangular system can be described equivalently in the polar coordinate system by the two
polar coordinates (r, ). [link] is valid for any vector, so we can use it to express the x- and y-

coordinates of vector r. In this way, we obtain the connection between the polar coordinates and

rectangular coordinates of point P:

Note:
Equation:

                                         x = r cos 

                                      {                       .

                                         y = r sin 
     Using polar coordinates, the unit vector ^r defines the
  positive direction along the radius r (radial direction) and,

     orthogonal to it, the unit vector ^t defines the positive
                direction of rotation by the angle .

Example:
Polar Coordinates
A treasure hunter finds one silver coin at a location 20.0 m away from a dry well in the direction
20° north of east and finds one gold coin at a location 10.0 m away from the well in the direction
20° north of west. What are the polar and rectangular coordinates of these findings with respect
to the well?
Strategy
The well marks the origin of the coordinate system and east is the +x-direction. We identify radial
distances from the locations to the origin, which are rS = 20.0 m (for the silver coin) and
rG = 10.0 m (for the gold coin). To find the angular coordinates, we convert 20° to radians:
20° = 20/180 = /9. We use [link] to find the x- and y-coordinates of the coins.
Solution
The angular coordinate of the silver coin is S = /9, whereas the angular coordinate of the gold
coin is G =  - /9 = 8/9. Hence, the polar coordinates of the silver coin are
(rS , S ) = (20.0 m, /9) and those of the gold coin are (rG, G) = (10.0 m, 8/9). We
substitute these coordinates into [link] to obtain rectangular coordinates. For the gold coin, the
coordinates are
Equation:
         xG = rG cos G = (10.0 m) cos 8/9 = -9.4 m                       (xG , yG ) = (-9.4 m, 3.4 m).
     {

         yG = rG sin G = (10.0 m) sin 8/9 = 3.4 m

For the silver coin, the coordinates are
Equation:

         xS = rS cos S = (20.0 m) cos /9 = 18.9 m                        (xS , yS ) = (18.9 m, 6.8 m).
     {

         yS = rS sin S = (20.0 m) sin /9 = 6.8 m

Vectors in Three Dimensions

To specify the location of a point in space, we need three coordinates (x, y, z), where coordinates x
and y specify locations in a plane, and coordinate z gives a vertical position above or below the
plane. Three-dimensional space has three orthogonal directions, so we need not two but three unit
vectors to define a three-dimensional coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate system, the

first two unit vectors are the unit vector of the x-axis ^i and the unit vector of the y-axis ^j. The third

unit vector k ^ is the direction of the z-axis ([link]). The order in which the axes are labeled, which
is the order in which the three unit vectors appear, is important because it defines the orientation of

the  coordinate  system.  The  order  x-y-z,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  order  ^  -  ^  -  k ^,  defines  the
                                                                                     i     j

standard right-handed coordinate system (positive orientation).
    Three unit vectors define a Cartesian system in three-
       dimensional space. The order in which these unit

    vectors appear defines the orientation of the coordinate
    system. The order shown here defines the right-handed

                              orientation.

In  three-dimensional     space,  vector  A   has  three   vector  components:     the  x-component         A  x  =        ^

                                                                                                                     A x i,

which  is  the  part  of  vector  A   along  the  x-axis;  the  y-component  A  y  =          ^  which  is  the   part  of  A 

                                                                                        A y j,

along the y-axis; and the z-component A  z = Azk ^, which is the part of the vector along the z-axis.

A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components ([link]):

Note:
Equation:

                                             ^                  ^  ^
                                             A = Ax i + Ay j + Az k.

If we know the coordinates of its origin b(xb, yb, zb) and of its end e(xe, ye, ze), its scalar
components are obtained by taking their differences: Ax and Ay are given by [link] and the z-
component is given by

Note:
Equation:

                                                   Az = ze - zb.

Magnitude A is obtained by generalizing [link] to three dimensions:

Note:
Equation:

                                             A = A2 + A2 + A2.

This expression for the vector magnitude comes from applying the Pythagorean theorem twice. As

seen     in  [link],  the  diagonal  in  the  xy-plane  has  length  A2                +  A2       and  its  square  adds   to  the  square

                                                                                    x           y

      2  to  give  A2.  Note  that  when  the  z-component   is  zero,  the            vector      lies  entirely  in  the  xy-plane  and

its description is reduced to two dimensions.

    A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum
                 of its three vector components.

Takeoff of a Drone
During a takeoff of IAI Heron ([link]), its position with respect to a control tower is 100 m above
the ground, 300 m to the east, and 200 m to the north. One minute later, its position is 250 m
above the ground, 1200 m to the east, and 2100 m to the north. What is the drone's displacement
vector with respect to the control tower? What is the magnitude of its displacement vector?

Strategy
We take the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system as the control tower. The direction of the

+x-axis  is  given  by  unit  vector    ^  to  the  east,  the  direction  of  the  +y-axis  is  given  by  unit  vector  ^  to
                                        i                                                                                 j

the north, and the direction of the +z-axis is given by unit vector k ^, which points up from the
ground. The drone's first position is the origin (or, equivalently, the beginning) of the
displacement vector and its second position is the end of the displacement vector.
Solution
We identify b(300.0 m, 200.0 m, 100.0 m) and e(1200 m, 2100 m, 250 m), and use [link] and
[link] to find the scalar components of the drone's displacement vector:
Equation:

                           Dx = xe - xb = 1200.0 m - 300.0 m = 900.0 m,

                           Dy = ye - yb = 2100.0 m - 200.0 m = 1900.0 m,
                           

                                Dz = ze - zb = 250.0 m - 100.0 m = 150.0 m.

We substitute these components into [link] to find the displacement vector:
Equation:

D   =         ^         ^         ^  =  900.0  m^i +  1900.0    m^j +  150.0   mk ^  =  (0.90^i +  1.90^j +       0.15k ^)  km.
       Dxi +     Dyj +     Dzk

We substitute into [link] to find the magnitude of the displacement:

Summary

    Vectors are described in terms of their components in a coordinate system. In two dimensions
    (in a plane), vectors have two components. In three dimensions (in space), vectors have three
    components.
    A vector component of a vector is its part in an axis direction. The vector component is the
    product of the unit vector of an axis with its scalar component along this axis. A vector is the
    resultant of its vector components.
    Scalar components of a vector are differences of coordinates, where coordinates of the origin
    are subtracted from end point coordinates of a vector. In a rectangular system, the magnitude
    of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.
    In a plane, the direction of a vector is given by an angle the vector has with the positive x-
    axis. This direction angle is measured counterclockwise. The scalar x-component of a vector
    can be expressed as the product of its magnitude with the cosine of its direction angle, and
    the scalar y-component can be expressed as the product of its magnitude with the sine of its
    direction angle.
    In a plane, there are two equivalent coordinate systems. The Cartesian coordinate system is

    defined  by     unit  vectors        ^  and  ^    along  the  x-axis  and   the  y-axis,  respectively.  The  polar
                                         i       j

    coordinate system is defined by the radial unit vector ^r, which gives the direction from the

    origin, and a unit vector ^t, which is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the radial direction.

An airplane is flying at an airspeed of 200 miles per hour headed on a SE
bearing of 140°. A north wind (from north to south) is blowing at 16.2
miles per hour, as shown in [link]. What are the ground speed and actual
bearing of the plane?
Ground speed refers to the speed of a plane relative to the ground. Airspeed
refers to the speed a plane can travel relative to its surrounding air mass.
These two quantities are not the same because of the effect of wind. In an
earlier section, we used triangles to solve a similar problem involving the
movement of boats. Later in this section, we will find the airplane's
groundspeed and bearing, while investigating another approach to problems
of this type. First, however, let's examine the basics of vectors.

A Geometric View of Vectors

A vector is a specific quantity drawn as a line segment with an arrowhead
at one end. It has an initial point, where it begins, and a terminal point,
where it ends. A vector is defined by its magnitude, or the length of the
line, and its direction, indicated by an arrowhead at the terminal point.
Thus, a vector is a directed line segment. There are various symbols that
distinguish vectors from other quantities:

      Lower case, boldfaced type, with or without an arrow on top such as v,
     u, w, v, u , w .
      Given initial point P and terminal point Q, a vector can be represented

      as P Q. The arrowhead on top is what indicates that it is not just a line,
      but a directed line segment.
      Given an initial point of (0, 0) and terminal point (a, b), a vector may
      be represented as a, b.

This last symbol a, b has special significance. It is called the standard
position. The position vector has an initial point (0, 0) and a terminal point
(a, b). To change any vector into the position vector, we think about the
change in the x-coordinates and the change in the y-coordinates. Thus, if the

initial point of a vector CD is C (x1, y1) and the terminal point is
D (x2, y2), then the position vector is found by calculating
Equation:
                                                         AB = x2 - x1 , y2 - y1 
                                                         = a, b

In [link], we see the original vector CD and the position vector AB.

Note:
Properties of Vectors
A vector is a directed line segment with an initial point and a terminal
point. Vectors are identified by magnitude, or the length of the line, and
direction, represented by the arrowhead pointing toward the terminal point.
The position vector has an initial point at (0, 0) and is identified by its
terminal point (a, b).

Example:
Exercise:
Problem:
Find the Position Vector
Consider the vector whose initial point is P (2, 3) and terminal point
is Q (6, 4). Find the position vector.
Solution:
The position vector is found by subtracting one x-coordinate from the
other x-coordinate, and one y-coordinate from the other y-coordinate.
Thus
Equation:

                                                           v = 6 - 2, 4 - 3
                                                           = 4, 1

The position vector begins at (0, 0) and terminates at (4, 1). The
graphs of both vectors are shown in [link].

We see that the position vector is 4, 1.
Example:

   Problem:
   Drawing a Vector with the Given Criteria and Its Equivalent
   Position Vector

   Find the position vector given that vector v has an initial point at
   (-3, 2) and a terminal point at (4, 5), then graph both vectors in the
   same plane.

   Solution:

   The position vector is found using the following calculation:
   Equation:

                                                            v = 4 - (-3), 5 - 2
                                                                 = 7, 3

   Thus, the position vector begins at (0, 0) and terminates at (7, 3). See
   [link].

Finding Magnitude and Direction

To work with a vector, we need to be able to find its magnitude and its
direction. We find its magnitude using the Pythagorean Theorem or the
distance formula, and we find its direction using the inverse tangent
function.
Note:
Magnitude and Direction of a Vector
Given a position vector v = a, b, the magnitude is found by

|v| = a2 + b2. The direction is equal to the angle formed with the x-axis,

or with the y-axis, depending on the application. For a position vector, the

direction is found by tan  = ( ) b   = tan-1 ( ) b , as illustrated in
         a  a

[link].

Two vectors v and u are considered equal if they have the same magnitude
and the same direction. Additionally, if both vectors have the same position
vector, they are equal.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding the Magnitude and Direction of a Vector

   Find the magnitude and direction of the vector with initial point
   P (-8, 1) and terminal point Q (-2, -5). Draw the vector.

   Solution:

   First, find the position vector.
   Equation:

                                                         u = -2, -(-8), -5-1
                                                             = 6, -6
We use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the magnitude.
Equation:

                               2  2
                  u = (6) + (-6)

          = 72
          = 62

The direction is given as
Equation:

                           -6        -1
          tan  =               = -1   = tan (-1)
                           6

          = -45°

However, the angle terminates in the fourth quadrant, so we add 360°
to obtain a positive angle. Thus, -45° + 360° = 315°. See [link].

Example:
Exercise:
   Problem:
   Showing That Two Vectors Are Equal

   Show that vector v with initial point at (5, -3) and terminal point at
   (-1, 2) is equal to vector u with initial point at (-1, -3) and
   terminal point at (-7, 2). Draw the position vector on the same grid
   as v and u. Next, find the magnitude and direction of each vector.

   Solution:

   As shown in [link], draw the vector v starting at initial (5, -3) and
   terminal point (-1, 2). Draw the vector u with initial point (-1, -3)
   and terminal point (-7, 2). Find the standard position for each.

   Next, find and sketch the position vector for v and u. We have
   Equation:

                                                     v = -1 - 5, 2 - (-3)
                                                         = -6, 5

                                                     u = -7 - (-1), 2 - (-3)
                                                         = -6, 5

   Since the position vectors are the same, v and u are the same.

   An alternative way to check for vector equality is to show that the
   magnitude and direction are the same for both vectors. To show that
   the magnitudes are equal, use the Pythagorean Theorem.
   Equation:
              2            2
v = (-1 - 5) + (2 - (-3))

2             2
= (-6) + (5)

= 36 + 25
= 61

                 2            2
u = (-7 - (-1)) + (2 - (-3))

2             2
= (-6) + (5)

= 36 + 25
= 61

As the magnitudes are equal, we now need to verify the direction.
Using the tangent function with the position vector gives
Equation:

           5        -1     5
tan  = -   = tan (- )
           6               6

= -39.8°

However, we can see that the position vector terminates in the second
quadrant, so we add 180°. Thus, the direction is

-39.8° + 180° = 140.2°.
Performing Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication

Now that we understand the properties of vectors, we can perform
operations involving them. While it is convenient to think of the vector u
= x, y as an arrow or directed line segment from the origin to the point
(x, y), vectors can be situated anywhere in the plane. The sum of two
vectors u and v, or vector addition, produces a third vector u+ v, the
resultant vector.

To find u + v, we first draw the vector u, and from the terminal end of u, we
drawn the vector v. In other words, we have the initial point of v meet the
terminal end of u. This position corresponds to the notion that we move
along the first vector and then, from its terminal point, we move along the
second vector. The sum u + v is the resultant vector because it results from
addition or subtraction of two vectors. The resultant vector travels directly
from the beginning of u to the end of v in a straight path, as shown in [link].

Vector subtraction is similar to vector addition. To find u - v, view it as u +
(-v). Adding -v is reversing direction of v and adding it to the end of u. The
new vector begins at the start of u and stops at the end point of -v. See
[link] for a visual that compares vector addition and vector subtraction
using parallelograms.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Adding and Subtracting Vectors
   Given u = 3, -2 and v = -1, 4, find two new vectors u + v, and
   u - v.
Solution:
To find the sum of two vectors, we add the components. Thus,
Equation:

                                                 u + v = 3, -2 + -1, 4
                                                 = 3 + (-1), -2 + 4
                                                 = 2, 2

See [link](a).
To find the difference of two vectors, add the negative components of
v to u. Thus,
Equation:

                                            u + (-v) = 3, -2 + 1, -4
                                            = 3 + 1, -2 + (-4)
                                            = 4, -6

See [link](b).

          (a) Sum of two vectors (b) Difference of two vectors
Multiplying By a Scalar

While adding and subtracting vectors gives us a new vector with a different
magnitude and direction, the process of multiplying a vector by a scalar, a
constant, changes only the magnitude of the vector or the length of the line.
Scalar multiplication has no effect on the direction unless the scalar is
negative, in which case the direction of the resulting vector is opposite the
direction of the original vector.

Note:
Scalar Multiplication
Scalar multiplication involves the product of a vector and a scalar. Each
component of the vector is multiplied by the scalar. Thus, to multiply v
= a, b by k, we have
Equation:

                                                                       kv = ka, kb

Only the magnitude changes, unless k is negative, and then the vector
reverses direction.

Example:
Exercise:

                                 2

Solution:

See [link] for a geometric interpretation. If v = 3, 1, then
Equation:
          3v = 3  3, 3  1

          = 9, 3

          1       1  1
             v =   3,  1
          2       2  2

             3  1
          = , 
             2  2

          -v = -3, -1

Analysis

Notice that the vector 3v is three times the length of v,  1  v is half the
                                                           2

length of v, and -v is the same length of v, but in the opposite direction.

   Using Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication to Find a New
   Vector
   Given u = 3, -2 and v = -1, 4, find a new vector w = 3u + 2v.
   Solution:
   First, we must multiply each vector by the scalar.
   Equation:

                                                                     3u = 3 3, -2
                                                                     = 9, -6
                                                                     2v = 2 -1, 4
                                                                     = -2, 8

   Then, add the two together.
   Equation:

                                                              w = 3u + 2v
                                                              = 9, -6 + -2, 8
                                                              = 9 - 2, -6 + 8
                                                              = 7, 2

   So, w = 7, 2.
Finding Component Form

In some applications involving vectors, it is helpful for us to be able to
break a vector down into its components. Vectors are comprised of two
components: the horizontal component is the x direction, and the vertical
component is the y direction. For example, we can see in the graph in [link]
that the position vector 2, 3 comes from adding the vectors v1 and v2. We
have v1 with initial point (0, 0) and terminal point (2, 0).
Equation:

                                                                v1 = 2 - 0, 0 - 0
                                                                = 2, 0

We also have v2 with initial point (0, 0) and terminal point (0, 3).
Equation:

                                                                v2 = 0 - 0, 3 - 0
                                                                = 0, 3

Therefore, the position vector is
Equation:

                                                                  v = 2 + 0, 3 + 0
                                                                  = 2, 3

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the magnitude of v1 is 2, and the
magnitude of v2 is 3. To find the magnitude of v, use the formula with the
position vector.
Equation:
                                  v  =  |v1 |2                          +              2

                                                                           |v2 |

                              = 22 + 32

                              = 13

The magnitude of v is 13. To find the direction, we use the tangent

function tan     y

              =     .

                 x

Equation:

                                                               v2

                              tan  =

                                                               v1

                                                               3

   Problem:
   Finding the Components of the Vector
   Find the components of the vector v with initial point (3, 2) and
   terminal point (7, 4).
   Solution:
   First find the standard position.
   Equation:

                                                                  v = 7 - 3, 4 - 2

   See the illustration in [link].

   The horizontal component is v1 = 4, 0 and the vertical component
   is v2 = 0, 2 .

Finding the Unit Vector in the Direction of v
In addition to finding a vector's components, it is also useful in solving
problems to find a vector in the same direction as the given vector, but of
magnitude 1. We call a vector with a magnitude of 1 a unit vector. We can
then preserve the direction of the original vector while simplifying
calculations.

Unit vectors are defined in terms of components. The horizontal unit vector
is written as i = 1, 0 and is directed along the positive horizontal axis.
The vertical unit vector is written as j = 0, 1 and is directed along the
positive vertical axis. See [link].

Note:

The Unit Vectors

If v is a nonzero vector, then   v   is a unit vector in the direction of v. Any
                                |v|

vector divided by its magnitude is a unit vector. Notice that magnitude is

always a scalar, and dividing by a scalar is the same as multiplying by the

reciprocal of the scalar.

Example:
Exercise:
   Problem:
   Finding the Unit Vector in the Direction of v

   Find a unit vector in the same direction as v = -5, 12 .

   Solution:

   First, we will find the magnitude.
   Equation:

                                    2               2
                       v = (-5) + (12)

                       = 25 + 144
                       = 169
                       = 13

Then we divide each component by |v |, which gives a unit vector in
the same direction as v:
Equation:

                        v       5         12
                       |v|                       j

Performing Operations with Vectors in Terms of i and j

So far, we have investigated the basics of vectors: magnitude and direction,
vector addition and subtraction, scalar multiplication, the components of
vectors, and the representation of vectors geometrically. Now that we are
familiar with the general strategies used in working with vectors, we will
represent vectors in rectangular coordinates in terms of i and j.

Note:
Vectors in the Rectangular Plane
Given a vector v with initial point P = (x1, y1) and terminal point
Q = (x2, y2 ), v is written as
Equation:

                                                     v = (x2 - x1 )i + (y2 - y1 )j

The position vector from (0, 0) to (a, b), where (x2 - x1) = a and
(y2 - y1) = b, is written as v = ai + bj. This vector sum is called a linear
combination of the vectors i and j.
The magnitude of v = ai + bj is given as |v| = a2 + b2. See [link].

                                                    = (-6 - 2)i + (6 - (-6))j
                                                    = -8i + 12j

Performing Operations on Vectors in Terms of i and j
When vectors are written in terms of i and j, we can carry out addition,
subtraction, and scalar multiplication by performing operations on
corresponding components.

Note:
Adding and Subtracting Vectors in Rectangular Coordinates
Given v = ai + bj and u = ci + dj, then
Equation:

                                                      v + u = (a + c)i + (b + d)j
                                                      v - u = (a - c)i + (b - d)j

   Equation:

                                                v1 + v2 = (2 + 4)i + (-3 + 5)j
                                                = 6i + 2j

Calculating the Component Form of a Vector: Direction
We have seen how to draw vectors according to their initial and terminal
points and how to find the position vector. We have also examined notation
for vectors drawn specifically in the Cartesian coordinate plane using
i and j. For any of these vectors, we can calculate the magnitude. Now, we
want to combine the key points, and look further at the ideas of magnitude
and direction.

Calculating direction follows the same straightforward process we used for
polar coordinates. We find the direction of the vector by finding the angle to
the horizontal. We do this by using the basic trigonometric identities, but
with |v| replacing r.

Note:
Vector Components in Terms of Magnitude and Direction
Given a position vector v = x, y and a direction angle ,
Equation:

                                  x  and                                   y

cos  =                                    sin  =

                                |v|                                      |v|

x = |v| cos                               y = |v| sin 

Thus, v = xi + yj = |v| cos i + |v| sin j, and magnitude is expressed
as |v| = x2 + y2.

   Writing a Vector in Terms of Magnitude and Direction

   Solution:
Using the conversion formulas x = |v| cos i and y = |v| sin j, we
find that
Equation:

                x = 7 cos(135°)i

                                 72

                =    72
                         2

This vector can be written as v = 7 cos(135°)i + 7 sin(135°)j or
simplified as

Finding the Dot Product of Two Vectors

As we discussed earlier in the section, scalar multiplication involves
multiplying a vector by a scalar, and the result is a vector. As we have seen,
multiplying a vector by a number is called scalar multiplication. If we
multiply a vector by a vector, there are two possibilities: the dot product and
the cross product. We will only examine the dot product here; you may
encounter the cross product in more advanced mathematics courses.

The dot product of two vectors involves multiplying two vectors together,
and the result is a scalar.

Note:
Dot Product
The dot product of two vectors v = a, b and u = c, d is the sum of the
product of the horizontal components and the product of the vertical
components.
Equation:

v  u = ac + bd

To find the angle between the two vectors, use the formula below.

   Problem:
   Finding Ground Speed and Bearing Using Vectors
We now have the tools to solve the problem we introduced in the
opening of the section.
An airplane is flying at an airspeed of 200 miles per hour headed on a
SE bearing of 140°. A north wind (from north to south) is blowing at
16.2 miles per hour. What are the ground speed and actual bearing of
the plane? See [link].

Solution:
The ground speed is represented by x in the diagram, and we need to
find the angle  in order to calculate the adjusted bearing, which will
be 140° + .
Notice in [link], that angle BCO must be equal to angle AOC by the
rule of alternating interior angles, so angle BCO is 140°. We can find
x by the Law of Cosines:
Equation:

2  2                         2

x = (16.2) + (200) - 2(16.2)(200) cos(140°)

x2 = 45, 226.41

x = 45, 226.41
x = 212.7

The ground speed is approximately 213 miles per hour. Now we can
calculate the bearing using the Law of Sines.
Equation:

      sin                 =  sin(140°)
       16.2                       212.7

      sin                 =     16.2 sin(140°)
                                           212.7

      = 0.04896

                -1

      sin (0.04896) = 2.8°

Therefore, the plane has a SE bearing of 140°+2.8°=142.8°. The
ground speed is 212.7 miles per hour.

      Introduction to Vectors
      Vector Operations
      The Unit Vector
Key Concepts

      The position vector has its initial point at the origin. See [link].
      If the position vector is the same for two vectors, they are equal. See
      [link].
      Vectors are defined by their magnitude and direction. See [link].
      If two vectors have the same magnitude and direction, they are equal.
      See [link].
      Vector addition and subtraction result in a new vector found by adding
      or subtracting corresponding elements. See [link].
      Scalar multiplication is multiplying a vector by a constant. Only the
      magnitude changes; the direction stays the same. See [link] and [link].
      Vectors are comprised of two components: the horizontal component
      along the positive x-axis, and the vertical component along the positive
      y-axis. See [link].
      The unit vector in the same direction of any nonzero vector is found by
      dividing the vector by its magnitude.
      The magnitude of a vector in the rectangular coordinate system is
      |v| = a2 + b2. See [link].
      In the rectangular coordinate system, unit vectors may be represented
      in terms of i and j where i represents the horizontal component and j
      represents the vertical component. Then, v = ai + bj is a scalar
      multiple of v by real numbers a and b. See [link] and [link].
      Adding and subtracting vectors in terms of i and j consists of adding or
      subtracting corresponding coefficients of i and corresponding
      coefficients of j. See [link].
      A vector v = ai + bj is written in terms of magnitude and direction as
      v = |v| cos i + |v| sin j. See [link].
      The dot product of two vectors is the product of the i terms plus the
      product of the j terms. See [link].
      We can use the dot product to find the angle between two vectors.
      [link] and [link].
      Dot products are useful for many types of physics applications. See
      [link].

Products of Vectors

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      Explain the difference between the scalar product and the vector product of two vectors.
      Determine the scalar product of two vectors.
      Determine the vector product of two vectors.
      Describe how the products of vectors are used in physics.

A vector can be multiplied by another vector but may not be divided by another vector. There are two kinds
of products of vectors used broadly in physics and engineering. One kind of multiplication is a scalar
multiplication of two vectors. Taking a scalar product of two vectors results in a number (a scalar), as its
name indicates. Scalar products are used to define work and energy relations. For example, the work that a
force (a vector) performs on an object while causing its displacement (a vector) is defined as a scalar
product of the force vector with the displacement vector. A quite different kind of multiplication is a vector
multiplication of vectors. Taking a vector product of two vectors returns as a result a vector, as its name
suggests. Vector products are used to define other derived vector quantities. For example, in describing
rotations, a vector quantity called torque is defined as a vector product of an applied force (a vector) and its
distance from pivot to force (a vector). It is important to distinguish between these two kinds of vector
multiplications because the scalar product is a scalar quantity and a vector product is a vector quantity.

The Scalar Product of Two Vectors (the Dot Product)

Scalar multiplication of two vectors yields a scalar product.

Note:
Scalar Product (Dot Product)

The scalar product A   B  of two vectors A  and B  is a number defined by the equation

Equation:

                                            A   B  = AB cos ,

where  is the angle between the vectors (shown in [link]). The scalar product is also called the dot
product because of the dot notation that indicates it.

In the definition of the dot product, the direction of angle  does not matter, and  can be measured from

either of the two vectors to the other because cos  = cos (-) = cos (2 - ). The dot product is a

negative number when 90° <   180° and is a positive number when 0°   < 90°. Moreover, the dot

product of two parallel vectors is A   B  = AB cos 0° = AB, and the dot product of two antiparallel
vectors is A   B  = AB cos 180° = -AB. The scalar product of two orthogonal vectors vanishes:
A   B  = AB cos 90° = 0. The scalar product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude:

Equation:

A  A  A = AA cos 0° = A .
         The scalar product of two vectors. (a) The angle between the two vectors. (b) The orthogonal

   projection A of vector A  onto the direction of vector B  . (c) The orthogonal projection B of vector
                                      B  onto the direction of vector A  .

Example:
The Scalar Product

For the vectors shown in [link], find the scalar product A   F .

Strategy

From [link], the magnitudes of vectors A  and F  are A = 10.0 and F = 20.0. Angle , between them, is the

difference:  =  -  = 110° - 35° = 75°. Substituting these values into [link] gives the scalar product.
Solution
A straightforward calculation gives us
Equation:

                             A  F = AF cos  = (10.0)(20.0) cos 75° = 51.76.

   Solution:

  A   B  = -57.3, F   C  = 27.8

In the Cartesian coordinate system, scalar products of the unit vector of an axis with other unit vectors of
axes always vanish because these unit vectors are orthogonal:
Equation:
                                       ^i  ^j = ^i ^j cos 90° = (1)(1)(0) = 0,

                                       ^^            ^^
                                       i  k = i k cos 90° = (1)(1)(0) = 0,

                                       ^^               ^^
                                       k  j = k j cos 90° = (1)(1)(0) = 0.

In these equations, we use the fact that the magnitudes of all unit vectors are one:               ^  =     ^  =  k ^  = 1. For
                                                                                                   i        j

unit vectors of the axes, [link] gives the following identities:
Equation:

                                       ^^            2   ^^  2        ^^     2

                                       i  i = i = j  j = j = k  k = k = 1.

The scalar product A   B  can also be interpreted as either the product of B with the projection A of vector
A  onto the direction of vector B  ([link](b)) or the product of A with the projection B of vector B  onto the
direction of vector A  ([link](c)):

Equation:

                                                 A   B   = AB cos 

                                                         = B(A cos ) = BA
                                                         = A(B cos ) = AB.

For example, in the rectangular coordinate system in a plane, the scalar x-component of a vector is its dot

product  with  the  unit  vector  ^i,  and  the  scalar  y-component  of  a  vector  is  its  dot  product  with  the  unit  vector  ^
                                                                                                                                     j

:

Equation:

                                  A   ^i =       A      ^
                                                        i cos A = A cos A = Ax

                                        .
                                  A  ^j =        A      ^
                                                        j cos (90° - A ) = A sin A = Ay

Scalar multiplication of vectors is commutative,

Note:
Equation:

                                                         A   B  = B   A  ,

and obeys the distributive law:
Note:
Equation:

                                 A   (B  + C  ) = A   B  + A   C  .

We can use the commutative and distributive laws to derive various relations for vectors, such as expressing
the dot product of two vectors in terms of their scalar components.

Since scalar products of two different unit vectors of axes give zero, and scalar products of unit vectors with
themselves give one (see [link] and [link]), there are only three nonzero terms in this expression. Thus, the
scalar product simplifies to

         Three dogs are playing with a stick.

Strategy

The components of force vector F  1 are F1x = 10.0 N, F1y = -20.4 N, and F1z = 2.0 N, whereas those
of force vector F  2 are F2x = -15.0 N, F2y = 0.0 N, and F2z = -6.2 N. Computing the scalar product of

these vectors and their magnitudes, and substituting into [link] gives the angle of interest.
Solution

The magnitudes of forces F  1 and F  2 are

Equation:
                      F1 = F 2 + F 2 + F 2 = 10.02 + 20.4 + 2.0 N = 22.8 N 2 2
                                     1x       1y           1z

and
Equation:

                           F2 = F 2 + F 2 + F 2 = 15.02 + 6.22 N = 16.2 N.

Substituting the scalar components into [link] yields the scalar product
Equation:

                F  1  F  2 = F1x F2x + F1y F2y + F1z F2z

                                                            = (10.0 N)(-15.0 N) + (-20.4 N)(0.0 N) + (2.0 N)(-6.2 N)

                                                                                                                                 2

Finally, substituting everything into [link] gives the angle
Equation:

Significance
Notice that when vectors are given in terms of the unit vectors of axes, we can find the angle between them
without knowing the specifics about the geographic directions the unit vectors represent. Here, for
example, the +x-direction might be to the east and the +y-direction might be to the north. But, the angle
between the forces in the problem is the same if the +x-direction is to the west and the +y-direction is to the
south.

The Work of a Force

When force F  pulls on an object and when it causes its displacement D  , we say the force performs work.

The amount of work the force does is the scalar product F   D  . If the stick in [link] moves momentarily

and  gets  displaced  by  vector  D   =                 ^  -         ^            cm,  how  much  work  is     done  by  the  third  dog  in     [link]?

is the pull from the third dog. Let's use W3 to denote the work done by force F  3 on displacement D  .

Solution
Calculating the work is a straightforward application of the dot product:
Equation:

W3    = F3  D = F3xDx + F3yDy + F3z Dz

    = (5.0 N)(0.0 cm) + (12.5 N)(-7.9 cm) + (0.0 N)(-4.2 cm)

    = -98.7 N  cm.

Significance
The SI unit of work is called the joule (J), where 1 J = 1 N  m. The unit cm  N can be written as
10-2m  N = 10-2J, so the answer can be expressed as W3 = -0.9875 J  -1.0 J.

The Vector Product of Two Vectors (the Cross Product)

Vector multiplication of two vectors yields a vector product.

Note:
Vector Product (Cross Product)

The vector product of two vectors A  and B  is denoted by A  × B  and is often referred to as a cross
product. The vector product is a vector that has its direction perpendicular to both vectors A  and B  . In
other words, vector A  × B  is perpendicular to the plane that contains vectors A  and B  , as shown in

[link]. The magnitude of the vector product is defined as
Equation:

                                           A  × B  = AB sin ,

where angle , between the two vectors, is measured from vector A  (first vector in the product) to vector
B  (second vector in the product), as indicated in [link], and is between 0° and 180°.

According to [link], the vector product vanishes for pairs of vectors that are either parallel ( = 0°) or
antiparallel ( = 180°) because sin 0° = sin 180° = 0.
      The vector product of two vectors is drawn in three-

dimensional space. (a) The vector product A  × B  is a vector
  perpendicular to the plane that contains vectors A  and B  .

Small squares drawn in perspective mark right angles between

A  and C  , and between B  and C  so that if A  and B  lie on the
floor, vector C  points vertically upward to the ceiling. (b) The

   vector product B  × A  is a vector antiparallel to vector
                           A  × B  .

On the line perpendicular to the plane that contains vectors A  and B  there are two alternative directions--

either up or down, as shown in [link]--and the direction of the vector product may be either one of them. In

the standard right-handed orientation, where the angle between vectors is measured counterclockwise from

the first vector, vector A  × B  points upward, as seen in [link](a). If we reverse the order of multiplication,
so that now B  comes first in the product, then vector B  × A  must point downward, as seen in [link](b).
This means that vectors A  × B  and B  × A  are antiparallel to each other and that vector multiplication is

not commutative but anticommutative. The anticommutative property means the vector product reverses

the sign when the order of multiplication is reversed:

Note:
Equation:

           A  × B  = -B  × A  .

The corkscrew right-hand rule is a common mnemonic used to determine the direction of the vector
product. As shown in [link], a corkscrew is placed in a direction perpendicular to the plane that contains
vectors A  and B  , and its handle is turned in the direction from the first to the second vector in the product.

The direction of the cross product is given by the progression of the corkscrew.

     The corkscrew right-hand rule can be used to determine the

    direction of the cross product A  × B  . Place a corkscrew in
  the direction perpendicular to the plane that contains vectors A 
   and B  , and turn it in the direction from the first to the second

      vector in the product. The direction of the cross product is
        given by the progression of the corkscrew. (a) Upward
       movement means the cross-product vector points up. (b)

    Downward movement means the cross-product vector points
                                  downward.

Example:
The Torque of a Force
The mechanical advantage that a familiar tool called a wrench provides ([link]) depends on magnitude F of
the applied force, on its direction with respect to the wrench handle, and on how far from the nut this force

is applied. The distance R from the nut to the point where force vector F  is attached is represented by the
radial vector R  . The physical vector quantity that makes the nut turn is called torque (denoted by ), and it
is the vector product of the distance between the pivot to force with the force:  = R  × F .

To loosen a rusty nut, a 20.00-N force is applied to the wrench handle at angle  = 40° and at a distance of
0.25 m from the nut, as shown in [link](a). Find the magnitude and direction of the torque applied to the
nut. What would the magnitude and direction of the torque be if the force were applied at angle  = 45°,
as shown in [link](b)? For what value of angle  does the torque have the largest magnitude?
         A wrench provides grip and mechanical advantage in applying torque to turn a nut. (a) Turn
                    counterclockwise to loosen the nut. (b) Turn clockwise to tighten the nut.

Strategy

We adopt the frame of reference shown in [link], where vectors R  and F  lie in the xy-plane and the origin
is at the position of the nut. The radial direction along vector R  (pointing away from the origin) is the
reference direction for measuring the angle  because R  is the first vector in the vector product
 = R  × F . Vector  must lie along the z-axis because this is the axis that is perpendicular to the xy-
plane, where both R  and F  lie. To compute the magnitude , we use [link]. To find the direction of , we

use the corkscrew right-hand rule ([link]).
Solution

For the situation in (a), the corkscrew rule gives the direction of R  × F  in the positive direction of the z-
axis. Physically, it means the torque vector  points out of the page, perpendicular to the wrench handle.

We identify F = 20.00 N and R = 0.25 m, and compute the magnitude using [link]:
Equation:

                 = R  × F  = RF sin  = (0.25 m)(20.00 N) sin 40° = 3.21 N  m.

For the situation in (b), the corkscrew rule gives the direction of R  × F  in the negative direction of the z-
axis. Physically, it means the vector  points into the page, perpendicular to the wrench handle. The

magnitude of this torque is
Equation:

                   = R × F = RF sin  = (0.25 m)(20.00 N) sin 45° = 3.53 N  m.

The torque has the largest value when sin  = 1, which happens when  = 90°. Physically, it means the
wrench is most effective--giving us the best mechanical advantage--when we apply the force
perpendicular to the wrench handle. For the situation in this example, this best-torque value is
best = RF = (0.25 m)(20.00 N) = 5.00 N  m.
Significance
When solving mechanics problems, we often do not need to use the corkscrew rule at all, as we'll see now

in the following equivalent solution. Notice that once we have identified that vector R  × F  lies along the

z-axis, we can write this vector in terms of the unit vector k ^ of the z-axis:
Equation:

                                        R  × F  = RF sin k ^.

In  this  equation,  the  number  that  multiplies  ^  is  the  scalar  z-component  of  the  vector  R   ×  F  .  In  the
                                                    k

computation of this component, care must be taken that the angle  is measured counterclockwise from R 

(first vector) to F  (second vector). Following this principle for the angles, we obtain

RF sin (+40°) = +3.2 N  m for the situation in (a), and we obtain RF sin (-45°) = -3.5 N  m for

the situation in (b). In the latter case, the angle is negative because the graph in [link] indicates the angle is

measured clockwise; but, the same result is obtained when this angle is measured counterclockwise

because +(360° - 45°) = +315° and sin (+315°) = sin (-45°). In this way, we obtain the solution

without reference to the corkscrew rule. For the situation in (a), the solution is R  × F  = +3.2 N  mk ^;
for the situation in (b), the solution is R  × F  = -3.5 N  mk ^.

   Problem:

  Check Your Understanding For the vectors given in [link], find the vector products A  × B  and
  C  × F .

   Solution:

  A  × B  = -40.1k ^ or, equivalently, A  × B  = 40.1, and the direction is into the page;
  C  × F  = +157.6k ^ or, equivalently, C  × F  = 157.6, and the direction is out of the page.

Similar to the dot product ([link]), the cross product has the following distributive property:

Note:
Equation:

                                        A  × (B  + C  ) = A  × B  + A  × C  .
The distributive property is applied frequently when vectors are expressed in their component forms, in
terms of unit vectors of Cartesian axes.

When we apply the definition of the cross product, [link], to unit vectors ^i, ^j, and k ^ that define the positive
x-, y-, and z-directions in space, we find that
Equation:

                                                                                         ^i × ^i = ^j × ^j = k ^ × k ^ = 0.

All other cross products of these three unit vectors must be vectors of unit magnitudes because ^i, ^j, and k ^

are   orthogonal.  For  example,  for  the  pair  ^  and  ^j,  the  magnitude  is  ^    ^  = ij sin 90° = (1)(1)(1) = 1.
                                                  i                                i×j

The direction of the vector product ^i × ^j must be orthogonal to the xy-plane, which means it must be along
the z-axis. The only unit vectors along the z-axis are -k ^ or +k ^. By the corkscrew rule, the direction of
vector ^i × ^j must be parallel to the positive z-axis. Therefore, the result of the multiplication ^i × ^j is
identical to +k ^. We can repeat similar reasoning for the remaining pairs of unit vectors. The results of these
multiplications are

Note:
Equation:

                                                          ^i × ^j = +k ^,
                                                          ^j × k ^ = +^i,
                                                          k ^ × ^i = +^j.

Notice that in [link], the three unit vectors ^i, ^j, and k ^ appear in the cyclic order shown in a diagram in [link]

(a).  The  cyclic  order  means  that  in  the  product   formula,  ^  follows  ^  and  comes  before  ^j,  or  ^  follows  ^  and
                                                                    i           k                               k           j

comes before ^i, or ^j follows ^i and comes before k ^. The cross product of two different unit vectors is always
a third unit vector. When two unit vectors in the cross product appear in the cyclic order, the result of such a
multiplication is the remaining unit vector, as illustrated in [link](b). When unit vectors in the cross product
appear in a different order, the result is a unit vector that is antiparallel to the remaining unit vector (i.e., the
result is with the minus sign, as shown by the examples in [link](c) and [link](d). In practice, when the task
is to find cross products of vectors that are given in vector component form, this rule for the cross-
multiplication of unit vectors is very useful.

([link]), and the results in [link] and [link] for unit vectors to perform the following algebra:

When performing algebraic operations involving the cross product, be very careful about keeping the
correct order of multiplication because the cross product is anticommutative. The last two steps that we still
have to do to complete our task are, first, grouping the terms that contain a common unit vector and, second,
factoring. In this way we obtain the following very useful expression for the computation of the cross
product:

When finding the cross product, in practice, we can use either [link] or [link], depending on which one of
them seems to be less complex computationally. They both lead to the same final result. One way to make
sure if the final result is correct is to use them both.

Example:

A Particle in a Magnetic Field

When moving in a magnetic field, some particles may experience a magnetic force. Without going into

details--a detailed study of magnetic phenomena comes in later chapters--let's acknowledge that the

magnetic field B  is a vector, the magnetic force F  is a vector, and the velocity u  of the particle is a vector.

The magnetic force vector is proportional to the vector product of the velocity vector with the magnetic

field vector, which we express as F  = u  × B  . In this equation, a constant  takes care of the consistency
in physical units, so we can omit physical units on vectors u  and B  . In this example, let's assume the

constant  is positive.

A   particle  moving  in  space  with  velocity  vector  u   =             ^  -         ^  +         ^  enters  a        region           with  a  magnetic
                                                                -5.0i            2.0j         3.5k

field and experiences a magnetic force. Find the magnetic force F  on this particle at the entry point to the

region where the magnetic field vector is (a) B  = 7.2^i - ^j - 2.4k ^ and (b) B  = 4.5k ^. In each case, find

magnitude F of the magnetic force and angle  the force vector F  makes with the given magnetic field

vector B  .

Strategy

First, we want to find the vector product u  × B  , because then we can determine the magnetic force using

F   =  u   ×  B  . Magnitude F can be found either by using components, F                        =      F 2              +F2              + Fz2, or by

                                                                                                                      x                y

computing the magnitude u  × B  directly using [link]. In the latter approach, we would have to find the

angle between vectors u  and B  . When we have F , the general method for finding the direction angle 
involves the computation of the scalar product F   B  and substitution into [link]. To compute the vector

product we can either use [link] or compute the product directly, whichever way is simpler.
Solution
The components of the velocity vector are ux = -5.0, uy = -2.0, and uz = 3.5.

(a) The components of the magnetic field vector are Bx = 7.2, By = -1.0, and Bz = -2.4. Substituting

them into [link] gives the scalar components of vector F  = u  × B  :

Equation:

                      Fx = (uy Bz - uz By ) = [(-2.0)(-2.4) - (3.5)(-1.0)] = 8.3
                      Fy = (uz Bx - ux Bz ) = [(3.5)(7.2) - (-5.0)(-2.4)] = 13.2 .
                      Fz = (ux By - uy Bx ) = [(-5.0)(-1.0) - (-2.0)(7.2)] = 19.4

Thus,  the  magnetic  force  is  F     =              ^  +            ^  +  19.4k ^)  and  its  magnitude  is
                                          (8.3i             13.2j

Equation:

                      F = F 2 + F 2 + F 2 =  2 2 2 (8.3) + (13.2) + (19.4) = 24.9.
                                 x          y            z

To compute angle , we may need to find the magnitude of the magnetic field vector,
Equation:

                      B = B2 + B2 + B2 =  2 2 2 (7.2) + (-1.0) + (-2.4) = 7.6,
                                       x       y            z

and the scalar product F   B  :

Equation:

        F   B  = FxBx + FyBy + FzBz = (8.3)(7.2) + (13.2)(-1.0) + (19.4)(-2.4) = 0.

Now, substituting into [link] gives angle :
Equation:

                                               F   B                        0

                                 cos  =                     =                         =0            = 90°.

                                               FB                 (18.2)(7.6)

Hence, the magnetic force vector is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector. (We could have saved some

time if we had computed the scalar product earlier.)

(b)  Because  vector  B   =         ^  has  only  one       component,         we     can  perform  the  algebra  quickly  and  find  the
                             4.5k

vector product directly:

Equation:

              F  = u  × B  = (-5.0^i - 2.0^j + 3.5k ^) × (4.5k ^)

                                                  ^            ^                      ^         ^              ^  ^
                          = [(-5.0)(4.5)i × k + (-2.0)(4.5)j × k + (3.5)(4.5)k × k]

                          = [-22.5(-^j) - 9.0(+^i) + 0] = (-9.0^i + 22.5^j).

The magnitude of the magnetic force is
Equation:

              F = F 2 + F 2 + F 2 =  2 2 2 (-9.0) + (22.5) + (0.0) = 24.2.
                                 x          y            z
Because the scalar product is
Equation:

               F  B = FxBx + FyBy + FzBz = (-9.0)(0) + (22.5)(0) + (0)(4.5) = 0,

the magnetic force vector F  is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector B  .

Significance
Even without actually computing the scalar product, we can predict that the magnetic force vector must
always be perpendicular to the magnetic field vector because of the way this vector is constructed. Namely,

the magnetic force vector is the vector product F  = u  × B  and, by the definition of the vector product
(see [link]), vector F  must be perpendicular to both vectors u  and B  .

In conclusion to this section, we want to stress that "dot product" and "cross product" are entirely different
mathematical objects that have different meanings. The dot product is a scalar; the cross product is a vector.
Later chapters use the terms dot product and scalar product interchangeably. Similarly, the terms cross
product and vector product are used interchangeably.

Summary

      There are two kinds of multiplication for vectors. One kind of multiplication is the scalar product, also
      known as the dot product. The other kind of multiplication is the vector product, also known as the
      cross product. The scalar product of vectors is a number (scalar). The vector product of vectors is a
      vector.
      Both kinds of multiplication have the distributive property, but only the scalar product has the
      commutative property. The vector product has the anticommutative property, which means that when
      we change the order in which two vectors are multiplied, the result acquires a minus sign.
      The scalar product of two vectors is obtained by multiplying their magnitudes with the cosine of the
      angle between them. The scalar product of orthogonal vectors vanishes; the scalar product of
      antiparallel vectors is negative.
      The vector product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them. Its magnitude is obtained
      by multiplying their magnitudes by the sine of the angle between them. The direction of the vector
      product can be determined by the corkscrew right-hand rule. The vector product of two either parallel
      or antiparallel vectors vanishes. The magnitude of the vector product is largest for orthogonal vectors.
      The scalar product of vectors is used to find angles between vectors and in the definitions of derived
      scalar physical quantities such as work or energy.
      The cross product of vectors is used in definitions of derived vector physical quantities such as torque
      or magnetic force, and in describing rotations.

Plotting Points Using Polar Coordinates

When we think about plotting points in the plane, we usually think of rectangular
coordinates (x, y) in the Cartesian coordinate plane. However, there are other ways of
writing a coordinate pair and other types of grid systems. In this section, we introduce to
polar coordinates, which are points labeled (r, ) and plotted on a polar grid. The polar
grid is represented as a series of concentric circles radiating out from the pole, or the
origin of the coordinate plane.
The polar grid is scaled as the unit circle with the positive x-axis now viewed as the

polar axis and the origin as the pole. The first coordinate r is the radius or length of the

directed line segment from the pole. The angle , measured in radians, indicates the

direction of r. We move counterclockwise from the polar axis by an angle of , and

measure a directed line segment the length of r in the direction of . Even though we

measure  first and then r, the polar point is written with the r-coordinate first. For

example, to plot the point (2,   4 ),  we would move     units in the counterclockwise
                                                      4

direction and then a length of 2 from the pole. This point is plotted on the grid in [link].

                 6

approach plotting a point with a negative r in two ways:

1. Plot the point (2,        )  by  moving      in the counterclockwise direction and
                          6                 6

     extending a directed line segment 2 units into the first quadrant. Then retrace

     the directed line segment back through the pole, and continue 2 units into the

     third quadrant;

2. Move          in the counterclockwise direction, and draw the directed line
            6

     segment from the pole 2 units in the negative direction, into the third

     quadrant.

Converting from Polar Coordinates to Rectangular Coordinates

When given a set of polar coordinates, we may need to convert them to rectangular
coordinates. To do so, we can recall the relationships that exist among the variables
x, y, r, and .
Equation:

        x

cos  =  r   x = r cos 

        y

sin  =  r   y = r sin 

Dropping a perpendicular from the point in the plane to the x-axis forms a right triangle,
as illustrated in [link]. An easy way to remember the equations above is to think of
cos  as the adjacent side over the hypotenuse and sin  as the opposite side over the
hypotenuse.

Note:                                                              y), let

To find r, we substitute the values for x and y into the formula r = x2 + y2. We

know that r must be positive, as              is in the first quadrant. Thus

                                          r = 32 + 32
                                          r = 9 + 9
                                          r = 18 = 32

So, r = 32          and  =     ,  giving  us  the  polar  point     (32,             ).  See  [link].

Analysis

There are other sets of polar coordinates that will be the same as our first solution. For

example, the points (-32, 5 ) and (32, - 7 ) will coincide with the original

                                   4

extend the directed line segment in the opposite direction, into the first quadrant. This is

the same point as (32,          ). The point (32,             -        7   )  is  a  move  further  clockwise
                                                                        4

Transforming Equations between Polar and Rectangular Forms
We can now convert coordinates between polar and rectangular form. Converting
equations can be more difficult, but it can be beneficial to be able to convert between the
two forms. Since there are a number of polar equations that cannot be expressed clearly
in Cartesian form, and vice versa, we can use the same procedures we used to convert
points between the coordinate systems. We can then use a graphing calculator to graph
either the rectangular form or the polar form of the equation.

Note:
Given an equation in polar form, graph it using a graphing calculator.

   1. Change the MODE to POL, representing polar form.
   2. Press the Y= button to bring up a screen allowing the input of six equations:

            r1, r2, . . . , r6.

   3. Enter the polar equation, set equal to r.
   4. Press GRAPH.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Writing a Cartesian Equation in Polar Form

   Write the Cartesian equation x2 + y2 = 9 in polar form.

Solution:

The goal is to eliminate x and y from the equation and introduce r and . Ideally,
we would write the equation r as a function of . To obtain the polar form, we will
use the relationships between (x, y) and (r, ). Since x = r cos  and
y = r sin , we can substitute and solve for r.
Equation:

            2           2

(r cos ) + (r sin ) = 9

   2     2     2     2
r cos  + r sin  = 9

2     2           2
r (cos  + sin ) = 9

r2(1) = 9                                                   2  2

                                Substitute cos  + sin  = 1.

                        r = ±3  Use the square root property.
Thus, x2 + y2 = 9, r = 3, and r = -3 should generate the same graph. See
[link].

(a)  Cartesian  form      2  +      2  =  9  (b)  Polar  form  r  =  3

                      x         y

To graph a circle in rectangular form, we must first solve for y.
Equation:

                                                                      x2 + y2 = 9
                                                                                  y2 = 9 - x2
                                                                                     y = ±9 - x2

Note that this is two separate functions, since a circle fails the vertical line test.
Therefore, we need to enter the positive and negative square roots into the
calculator separately, as two equations in the form Y1 = 9 - x2 and
Y2 = -9 - x2. Press GRAPH.

   Problem:
   Rewriting a Cartesian Equation as a Polar Equation
Rewrite the Cartesian equation x2 + y2 = 6y as a polar equation.

Solution:

This equation appears similar to the previous example, but it requires different
steps to convert the equation.

We can still follow the same procedures we have already learned and make the
following substitutions:
Equation:

   2                                  2         2   2
                            Use x + y = r .
r = 6y
                            Substitute y = r sin .
   2
                            Set equal to 0.
r = 6r sin 

                  2

          r - 6r sin  = 0

r(r - 6 sin ) = 0 Factor and solve.

r=0                         We reject r = 0, as it only represents one point, (0, 0).

r = 6 sin 

Therefore,  the  equations      2  +      2  =  6y  and  r  =  6  sin   should give us the same

                            x         y

graph. See [link].

The Cartesian or rectangular equation is plotted on the rectangular grid, and the
polar equation is plotted on the polar grid. Clearly, the graphs are identical.

                      r sin  = 3r cos  + 2

           r sin  - 3r cos  = 2

Identify and Graph Polar Equations by Converting to Rectangular
Equations

We have learned how to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, and we
have seen that the points are indeed the same. We have also transformed polar equations
to rectangular equations and vice versa. Now we will demonstrate that their graphs,
while drawn on different grids, are identical.
Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Graphing a Polar Equation by Converting to a Rectangular Equation

   Covert the polar equation r = 2 sec  to a rectangular equation, and draw its
   corresponding graph.

Solution:

The conversion is
Equation:

                   r = 2 sec 

                   r=       2
                       cos 

                   r cos  = 2

                   x=2

Notice that the equation r = 2 sec  drawn on the polar grid is clearly the same as
the vertical line x = 2 drawn on the rectangular grid (see [link]). Just as x = c is
the standard form for a vertical line in rectangular form, r = c sec  is the
standard form for a vertical line in polar form.

(a) Polar grid (b) Rectangular coordinate system
A similar discussion would demonstrate that the graph of the function r = 2 csc 
will be the horizontal line y = 2. In fact, r = c csc  is the standard form for a
horizontal line in polar form, corresponding to the rectangular form y = c.

   Problem:
   Rewriting a Polar Equation in Cartesian Form

Rewrite the polar equation r = 1-2 cos  3 as a Cartesian equation.

Solution:

The goal is to eliminate  and r, and introduce x and y. We clear the fraction, and
then use substitution. In order to replace r with x and y, we must use the
expression x2 + y2 = r2.
Equation:

                   r=                3
                          1-2 cos 

     r(1 - 2 cos ) = 3

                                        x                                        x

     r (1 - 2 ( )) = 3                                   Use cos  =              r   to eliminate .

                                        r

     r - 2x = 3

                   r = 3 + 2x                            Isolate r.

                   2                             2

                   r = (3 + 2x)                          Square both sides.

                2  2                              2            2              2      2

           x + y = (3 + 2x)                              Use x + y = r .

The  Cartesian  equation  is  x2           +  y2  =  (3  +              2  However,  to  graph  it,  especially

                                                            2x) .

using a graphing calculator or computer program, we want to isolate y.

Equation:

                              2               2             2

                              x + y = (3 + 2x)

                                              2             2              2

                                           y = (3 + 2x) - x

                                              y = ±(3 + 2x) - x 2 2
When our entire equation has been changed from r and  to x and y, we can stop,
unless asked to solve for y or simplify. See [link].

   The "hour-glass" shape of the graph is called a hyperbola. Hyperbolas have many
   interesting geometric features and applications, which we will investigate further
   in Analytic Geometry.

Analysis

In this example, the right side of the equation can be expanded and the equation
simplified further, as shown above. However, the equation cannot be written as a single
function in Cartesian form. We may wish to write the rectangular equation in the
hyperbola's standard form. To do this, we can start with the initial equation.

Key Concepts

      The polar grid is represented as a series of concentric circles radiating out from the
      pole, or origin.
      To plot a point in the form (r, ),  > 0, move in a counterclockwise direction
      from the polar axis by an angle of , and then extend a directed line segment from
      the pole the length of r in the direction of . If  is negative, move in a clockwise
      direction, and extend a directed line segment the length of r in the direction of .
      See [link].
      If r is negative, extend the directed line segment in the opposite direction of . See
      [link].
      To convert from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates, use the formulas
      x = r cos  and y = r sin . See [link] and [link].
      To convert from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, use one or more of

      the formulas: cos  = r , sin  = r , tan  = x , x y y and r = x2 + y2. See [link].
      Transforming equations between polar and rectangular forms means making the
      appropriate substitutions based on the available formulas, together with algebraic
      manipulations. See [link], [link], and [link].
      Using the appropriate substitutions makes it possible to rewrite a polar equation as
      a rectangular equation, and then graph it in the rectangular plane. See [link], [link],
      and [link].

Section Exercises

Verbal
Exercise:

   Problem: How are polar coordinates different from rectangular coordinates?

   Solution:
   For polar coordinates, the point in the plane depends on the angle from the positive
   x-axis and distance from the origin, while in Cartesian coordinates, the point
   represents the horizontal and vertical distances from the origin. For each point in
   the coordinate plane, there is one representation, but for each point in the polar
   plane, there are infinite representations.
Exercise:
   Problem:
   How are the polar axes different from the x- and y-axes of the Cartesian plane?
Exercise:

   Problem: Explain how polar coordinates are graphed.

   Solution:
   Determine  for the point, then move r units from the pole to plot the point. If r is
   negative, move r units from the pole in the opposite direction but along the same
   angle. The point is a distance of r away from the origin at an angle of  from the
   polar axis.

negative angle and a positive radius and is plotted by first moving to an angle of

           and then moving 3 units down, which is the positive direction for a negative

Parametric Equations
In this section, you will:

      Parameterize a curve.
      Eliminate the parameter.
      Find a rectangular equation for a curve defined parametrically.
      Find parametric equations for curves defined by rectangular equations.
Consider the path a moon follows as it orbits a planet, which
simultaneously rotates around the sun, as seen in [link]. At any moment, the
moon is located at a particular spot relative to the planet. But how do we
write and solve the equation for the position of the moon when the distance
from the planet, the speed of the moon's orbit around the planet, and the
speed of rotation around the sun are all unknowns? We can solve only for
one variable at a time.

In this section, we will consider sets of equations given by x (t) and y (t)
where t is the independent variable of time. We can use these parametric
equations in a number of applications when we are looking for not only a
particular position but also the direction of the movement. As we trace out
successive values of t, the orientation of the curve becomes clear. This is
one of the primary advantages of using parametric equations: we are able to
trace the movement of an object along a path according to time. We begin
this section with a look at the basic components of parametric equations and
what it means to parameterize a curve. Then we will learn how to eliminate
the parameter, translate the equations of a curve defined parametrically into
rectangular equations, and find the parametric equations for curves defined
by rectangular equations.

Parameterizing a Curve

When an object moves along a curve--or curvilinear path--in a given
direction and in a given amount of time, the position of the object in the
plane is given by the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. However, both x
and y vary over time and so are functions of time. For this reason, we add
another variable, the parameter, upon which both x and y are dependent
functions. In the example in the section opener, the parameter is time, t.
The x position of the moon at time, t, is represented as the function x(t),
and the y position of the moon at time, t, is represented as the function y(t).
Together, x(t) and y(t) are called parametric equations, and generate an
ordered pair (x(t), y(t)). Parametric equations primarily describe motion
and direction.

When we parameterize a curve, we are translating a single equation in two
variables, such as x and y , into an equivalent pair of equations in three
variables, x, y, and t. One of the reasons we parameterize a curve is
because the parametric equations yield more information: specifically, the
direction of the object's motion over time.

When we graph parametric equations, we can observe the individual

behaviors of x and of y. There are a number of shapes that cannot be

represented in the form y = f(x), meaning that they are not functions. For

example,  consider  the  graph  of  a  circle,  given  as      2  =       2  +      2  Solving  for

                                                           r         x          y.

y gives y = ±r2 - x2, or two equations: y1 = r2 - x2 and

y2 = -r2 - x2. If we graph y1 and y2 together, the graph will not pass
the vertical line test, as shown in [link]. Thus, the equation for the graph of
a circle is not a function.

However, if we were to graph each equation on its own, each one would
pass the vertical line test and therefore would represent a function. In some
instances, the concept of breaking up the equation for a circle into two
functions is similar to the concept of creating parametric equations, as we
use two functions to produce a non-function. This will become clearer as
we move forward.

Note:
Parametric Equations
Suppose t is a number on an interval, I. The set of ordered pairs, (x(t),
y(t)), where x = f(t) and y = g(t), forms a plane curve based on the
parameter t. The equations x = f(t) and y = g(t) are the parametric
equations.

   Problem:
   Parameterizing a Curve

Parameterize the curve y = x2 - 1 letting x(t) = t. Graph both
equations.

Solution:

If x (t) = t, then to find y (t) we replace the variable x with the

expression  given  in  x  (t).  In  other  words,  y  (t)  =     2  -  1.              Make  a

y  (t)  =  1  -     2  Our  pair  of  parametric  equations  is

                 t.

Equation:

                                      x(t) = t
                                      y(t) = 1 - t2

To graph the equations, first we construct a table of values like that in
[link]. We can choose values around t = 0, from t = -3 to t = 3.
The values in the x(t) column will be the same as those in the t
column because x(t) = t. Calculate values for the column y(t).

The  graph  of  y  =  1  -     2  is  a  parabola  facing  downward,                            as  shown  in

                            t

[link]. We have mapped the curve over the interval [-3, 3], shown as

a solid line with arrows indicating the orientation of the curve

according to t. Orientation refers to the path traced along the curve in

terms of increasing values of t. As this parabola is symmetric with

respect to the line x = 0, the values of x are reflected across the y-

axis.

   Problem:
   Finding Parametric Equations That Model Given Criteria

   An object travels at a steady rate along a straight path (-5, 3) to
   (3, -1) in the same plane in four seconds. The coordinates are
   measured in meters. Find parametric equations for the position of the
   object.

Solution:

The parametric equations are simple linear expressions, but we need
to view this problem in a step-by-step fashion. The x-value of the
object starts at -5 meters and goes to 3 meters. This means the
distance x has changed by 8 meters in 4 seconds, which is a rate of
4 s , 8 m or 2 m/s. We can write the x-coordinate as a linear function
with respect to time as x(t) = 2t - 5. In the linear function template
y = mx + b, 2t = mx and -5 = b.

Similarly, the y-value of the object starts at 3 and goes to -1, which is

a change in the distance y of -4 meters in 4 seconds, which is a rate of

-4 m    ,  or  -1m/s.  We  can  also  write  the  y-coordinate  as  the  linear
   4 s

function y(t) = -t + 3. Together, these are the parametric equations

for the position of the object, where x and y are expressed in meters

and t represents time:

Equation:

                                x(t) = 2t - 5
                                y(t) = -t + 3

Using these equations, we can build a table of values for t, x, and y
(see [link]). In this example, we limited values of t to non-negative
numbers. In general, any value of t can be used.
t  x(t) = 2t - 5      y(t) = -t + 3
                      y = -(0) + 3 = 3
0  x = 2(0) - 5 = -5  y = -(1) + 3 = 2
                      y = -(2) + 3 = 1
1  x = 2(1) - 5 = -3  y = -(3) + 3 = 0
                      y = -(4) + 3 = -1
2  x = 2(2) - 5 = -1

3  x = 2(3) - 5 = 1

4  x = 2(4) - 5 = 3

From this table, we can create three graphs, as shown in [link].

       (a) A graph of x vs. t, representing the horizontal position over
        time. (b) A graph of y vs. t, representing the vertical position
      over time. (c) A graph of y vs. x, representing the position of the

                            object in the plane at time t.

Analysis
Again, we see that, in [link](c), when the parameter represents time, we
can indicate the movement of the object along the path with arrows.

Eliminating the Parameter

In many cases, we may have a pair of parametric equations but find that it is
simpler to draw a curve if the equation involves only two variables, such as
x and y. Eliminating the parameter is a method that may make graphing
some curves easier. However, if we are concerned with the mapping of the
equation according to time, then it will be necessary to indicate the
orientation of the curve as well. There are various methods for eliminating
the parameter t from a set of parametric equations; not every method works
for every type of equation. Here we will review the methods for the most
common types of equations.

Eliminating the Parameter from Polynomial, Exponential, and
Logarithmic Equations

For polynomial, exponential, or logarithmic equations expressed as two
parametric equations, we choose the equation that is most easily
manipulated and solve for t. We substitute the resulting expression for t
into the second equation. This gives one equation in x and y.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:

                t

write the parametric equations as a Cartesian equation.

Solution:
We will begin with the equation for y because the linear equation is
easier to solve for t.
Equation:

                                                                      y = 2+t

                                                                      y-2 = t

Next, substitute y - 2 for t in x(t).
Equation:

x = t2 + 1                                   Substitute the expression f or t into x.

                                          2

x = (y - 2) + 1
x = y2 - 4y + 4 + 1
x = y2 - 4y + 5
x = y2 - 4y + 5

The  Cartesian  form  is  x                  =      2  -  4y  +  5.

Analysis

This is an equation for a parabola in which, in rectangular terms, x is
dependent on y. From the curve's vertex at (1, 2), the graph sweeps out to
the right. See [link]. In this section, we consider sets of equations given by
the functions x (t) and y (t), where t is the independent variable of time.
Notice, both x and y are functions of time; so in general y is not a function
of x.

Solve the first equation for t.

   The Cartesian form is y = log (x - 2) . 2
Analysis

To be sure that the parametric equations are equivalent to the Cartesian
equation, check the domains. The parametric equations restrict the domain
on x = t + 2 to t > 0; we restrict the domain on x to x > 2. The
domain for the parametric equation y = log(t) is restricted to t > 0; we
limit the domain on y = log (x - 2)2 to x > 2.

Eliminating the Parameter from Trigonometric Equations
Eliminating the parameter from trigonometric equations is a straightforward
substitution. We can use a few of the familiar trigonometric identities and
the Pythagorean Theorem.

First, we use the identities:
Equation:

                                                                      x (t) = a cos t

Solving for cos t and sin t, we have
Equation:

                                                                                  = cos t

                                                                                                             a
                                                                                                             y

                                                                                  = sin t

                                                                                                             b

Finding Cartesian Equations from Curves Defined
Parametrically

When we are given a set of parametric equations and need to find an
equivalent Cartesian equation, we are essentially "eliminating the
parameter." However, there are various methods we can use to rewrite a set
of parametric equations as a Cartesian equation. The simplest method is to
set one equation equal to the parameter, such as x (t) = t. In this case, y (t)
can be any expression. For example, consider the following pair of
equations.
Equation:

                                                                       x (t) = t

                                                                                                                                   2

                                                                       y (t) = t - 3

Rewriting this set of parametric equations is a matter of substituting x for t.

Thus,  the  Cartesian  equation  is  y  =       2  -  3.

   Problem:
   Finding a Cartesian Equation Using Alternate Methods

   Use two different methods to find the Cartesian equation equivalent to
   the given set of parametric equations.
   Equation:

                                                                       x(t) = 3t - 2
                                                                       y(t) = t + 1
Solution:

Method 1. First, let's solve the x equation for t. Then we can
substitute the result into the y equation.
Equation:

       x = 3t - 2

x + 2 = 3t

x+2    =t
    3

Now substitute the expression for t into the y equation.
Equation:

y = t+1

          x+2

y=(       3    )+1

       x       2

y=     3  +    3  +1

       1          5

y = x+            3
       3

Method 2. Solve the y equation for t and substitute this expression in
the x equation.
Equation:

                                                                          y = t+1

                                                                 y-1 = t

Make the substitution and then solve for y.
Equation:
       x = 3(y - 1) - 2

       x = 3y - 3 - 2

       x = 3y - 5

x + 5 = 3y

x+5    =y

           1       5
       y = x+

Finding Parametric Equations for Curves Defined by
Rectangular Equations

Although we have just shown that there is only one way to interpret a set of
parametric equations as a rectangular equation, there are multiple ways to
interpret a rectangular equation as a set of parametric equations. Any
strategy we may use to find the parametric equations is valid if it produces
equivalency. In other words, if we choose an expression to represent x, and
then substitute it into the y equation, and it produces the same graph over
the same domain as the rectangular equation, then the set of parametric
equations is valid. If the domain becomes restricted in the set of parametric
equations, and the function does not allow the same values for x as the
domain of the rectangular equation, then the graphs will be different.

   Finding a Set of Parametric Equations for Curves Defined by

   Find a set of equivalent parametric equations for y = (x + 3) + 1. 2

   Solution:

   An obvious choice would be to let x (t) = t. Then
   y (t) = (t + 3) + 1. 2 But let's try something more interesting. What
   if we let x = t + 3? Then we have
   Equation:

                                                                                                                              2

                                                           y = (x + 3) + 1

                                                                                                                                                  2

                                                           y = ((t + 3) + 3) + 1

                                                                                                                             2

                                                           y = (t + 6) + 1

   The set of parametric equations is
   Equation:

             x(t) = t + 3

                                                               2

             y(t) = (t + 6) + 1

      Introduction to Parametric Equations
      Converting Parametric Equations to Rectangular Form

Key Concepts

      Parameterizing a curve involves translating a rectangular equation in
      two variables, x and y, into two equations in three variables, x, y, and
      t. Often, more information is obtained from a set of parametric
      equations. See [link], [link], and [link].
      Sometimes equations are simpler to graph when written in rectangular
      form. By eliminating t, an equation in x and y is the result.
      To eliminate t, solve one of the equations for t, and substitute the
      expression into the second equation. See [link], [link], [link], and
      [link].
      Finding the rectangular equation for a curve defined parametrically is
      basically the same as eliminating the parameter. Solve for t in one of
      the equations, and substitute the expression into the second equation.
      See [link].
      There are an infinite number of ways to choose a set of parametric
      equations for a curve defined as a rectangular equation.
      Find an expression for x such that the domain of the set of parametric
      equations remains the same as the original rectangular equation. See
      [link].

         Determine whether an ordered pair is a solution of a system
         of equations (IA 4.1.1)
         A system of linear equations is a group of two or more linear
         equations. For example,
         Equation:

                                                                               y = -2x + 5
                                                                          {

                                                                               y = 2x + 7

         is a system of linear equations
A solution to a system of linear equations is an ordered pair x,y

     3x - y = 5

Solution:
We substitute (3, 1) into both equations:

2x - 6y = 0              3x - 4y = 5

2(3) - 6(1) = 0          3(3) - 4(1) = 5

6-6 = 0          True    9-4 = 5                  True

0=0                      5=5

(3, 1) is a solution to  (3, 1) is a solution to

2x - 6y = 0              3x - 4y = 5

Conclusion: since (3, 1) is a solution to both
equations, then it is a solution to the system

    2x - 6y = 0
{

    3x - 4y = 5

Next we substitute (-3, -1) into both equations:
2x - 6y = 0             3x - 4y = 5

2(-3) - 6(-1) = 0       3(-3) - 4(-1) = 5
-6 + 6 = 0              -9 + 4 = 5
0=0                     -5 = 5

True                    False

(-3, -1) is a solution  (-3, -1) is not a
to 2x - 6y = 0          solution to 3x - 4y = 5

Conclusion: Since (-3, -1) is not a solution to one
of the equations, then it is not a solution to the

(credit: Thomas Sørenes)
A skateboard manufacturer introduces a new line of boards. The manufacturer
tracks its costs, which is the amount it spends to produce the boards, and its
revenue, which is the amount it earns through sales of its boards. How can the
company determine if it is making a profit with its new line? How many
skateboards must be produced and sold before a profit is possible? In this
section, we will consider linear equations with two variables to answer these
and similar questions.

Introduction to Systems of Equations

In order to investigate situations such as that of the skateboard manufacturer,
we need to recognize that we are dealing with more than one variable and likely
more than one equation. A system of linear equations consists of two or more
linear equations made up of two or more variables such that all equations in the
system are considered simultaneously. To find the unique solution to a system
of linear equations, we must find a numerical value for each variable in the
system that will satisfy all equations in the system at the same time. Some linear
systems may not have a solution and others may have an infinite number of
solutions. In order for a linear system to have a unique solution, there must be at
least as many equations as there are variables. Even so, this does not guarantee
a unique solution.

In this section, we will look at systems of linear equations in two variables,
which consist of two equations that contain two different variables. For
example, consider the following system of linear equations in two variables.
Equation:

2x + y =    15
   3x- y =  5

The solution to a system of linear equations in two variables is any ordered pair
that satisfies each equation independently. In this example, the ordered pair (4,
7) is the solution to the system of linear equations. We can verify the solution
by substituting the values into each equation to see if the ordered pair satisfies
both equations. Shortly we will investigate methods of finding such a solution if
it exists.
Equation:

                                                                2(4) + (7) = 15 True

                                                                3(4) - (7) = 5 True

In addition to considering the number of equations and variables, we can
categorize systems of linear equations by the number of solutions. A consistent
system of equations has at least one solution. A consistent system is considered
to be an independent system if it has a single solution, such as the example we
just explored. The two lines have different slopes and intersect at one point in
the plane. A consistent system is considered to be a dependent system if the
equations have the same slope and the same y-intercepts. In other words, the
lines coincide so the equations represent the same line. Every point on the line
represents a coordinate pair that satisfies the system. Thus, there are an infinite
number of solutions.

Another type of system of linear equations is an inconsistent system, which is
one in which the equations represent two parallel lines. The lines have the same
slope and different y-intercepts. There are no points common to both lines;
hence, there is no solution to the system.

Note:
Types of Linear Systems
There are three types of systems of linear equations in two variables, and three
types of solutions.

      An independent system has exactly one solution pair (x, y). The point
      where the two lines intersect is the only solution.
      An inconsistent system has no solution. Notice that the two lines are
      parallel and will never intersect.
      A dependent system has infinitely many solutions. The lines are
      coincident. They are the same line, so every coordinate pair on the line is
      a solution to both equations.

[link] compares graphical representations of each type of system.
Note:
Given a system of linear equations and an ordered pair, determine
whether the ordered pair is a solution.

   1. Substitute the ordered pair into each equation in the system.
   2. Determine whether true statements result from the substitution in both

      equations; if so, the ordered pair is a solution.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Determining Whether an Ordered Pair Is a Solution to a System of
   Equations

   Determine whether the ordered pair (5, 1) is a solution to the given
   system of equations.
   Equation:

                                                                                 x + 3y = 8
                                                                                 2x - 9 = y
Solution:

Substitute the ordered pair (5, 1) into both equations.
Equation:

(5) + 3(1) = 8

8=8             True

2(5) - 9 = (1)

1=1             True

   The ordered pair (5, 1) satisfies both equations, so it is the solution to the
   system.

Analysis

We can see the solution clearly by plotting the graph of each equation. Since
the solution is an ordered pair that satisfies both equations, it is a point on both
of the lines and thus the point of intersection of the two lines. See [link].
Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Determine whether the ordered pair (8, 5) is a solution to the following
   system.
   Equation:

                                                                             5x-4y = 20
                                                                              2x + 1 = 3y

   Solution:
   Not a solution.

Solving Systems of Equations by Graphing

There are multiple methods of solving systems of linear equations. For a system
of linear equations in two variables, we can determine both the type of system
and the solution by graphing the system of equations on the same set of axes.

                                                                       y = -2x-8

Graph both equations on the same set of axes as in [link].

The lines appear to intersect at the point (-3,-2). We can check to make
sure that this is the solution to the system by substituting the ordered pair
into both equations.
Equation:
2(-3) + (-2) = -8

-8 = -8            True

(-3) - (-2) = -1

-1 = -1            True

The solution to the system is the ordered pair (-3,-2), so the system is
independent.

   Solution:
   The solution to the system is the ordered pair (-5, 3).
Note:
Can graphing be used if the system is inconsistent or dependent?
Yes, in both cases we can still graph the system to determine the type of system
and solution. If the two lines are parallel, the system has no solution and is
inconsistent. If the two lines are identical, the system has infinite solutions and
is a dependent system.

Solving Systems of Equations by Substitution

Solving a linear system in two variables by graphing works well when the
solution consists of integer values, but if our solution contains decimals or
fractions, it is not the most precise method. We will consider two more methods
of solving a system of linear equations that are more precise than graphing. One
such method is solving a system of equations by the substitution method, in
which we solve one of the equations for one variable and then substitute the
result into the second equation to solve for the second variable. Recall that we
can solve for only one variable at a time, which is the reason the substitution
method is both valuable and practical.

Note:
Given a system of two equations in two variables, solve using the
substitution method.

   1. Solve one of the two equations for one of the variables in terms of the
      other.

   2. Substitute the expression for this variable into the second equation, then
      solve for the remaining variable.

   3. Substitute that solution into either of the original equations to find the
      value of the first variable. If possible, write the solution as an ordered pair.

   4. Check the solution in both equations.

   Problem:
   Solving a System of Equations in Two Variables by Substitution

   Solve the following system of equations by substitution.
   Equation:

                                                                            -x + y = -5
                                                                            2x - 5y = 1

   Solution:

   First, we will solve the first equation for y.
   Equation:
                         -x + y = -5
                         y = x-5

Now we can substitute the expression x-5 for y in the second equation.
Equation:

                                                               2x - 5y = 1
                                                               2x - 5(x - 5) = 1
                                                               2x - 5x + 25 = 1
                                                               -3x = -24
                                                               x=8

Now, we substitute x = 8 into the first equation and solve for y.
Equation:

                                                                   -(8) + y = -5
                                                                   y=3

Our solution is (8, 3).

Check the solution by substituting (8, 3) into both equations.
Equation:

           -x + y = -5                True
           -(8) + (3) = -5            True
           2x - 5y = 1
           2(8) - 5(3) = 1

                                                                               4 = 3x-2y

   Solution:

      (-2, -5)

Note:
Can the substitution method be used to solve any linear system in two
variables?
Yes, but the method works best if one of the equations contains a coefficient of
1 or -1 so that we do not have to deal with fractions.

Solving Systems of Equations in Two Variables by the Addition
Method

A third method of solving systems of linear equations is the addition method.
In this method, we add two terms with the same variable, but opposite
coefficients, so that the sum is zero. Of course, not all systems are set up with
the two terms of one variable having opposite coefficients. Often we must
adjust one or both of the equations by multiplication so that one variable will be
eliminated by addition.

Note:
Given a system of equations, solve using the addition method.

   1. Write both equations with x- and y-variables on the left side of the equal
      sign and constants on the right.
   2. Write one equation above the other, lining up corresponding variables. If
      one of the variables in the top equation has the opposite coefficient of the
      same variable in the bottom equation, add the equations together,
      eliminating one variable. If not, use multiplication by a nonzero number
      so that one of the variables in the top equation has the opposite coefficient
      of the same variable in the bottom equation, then add the equations to
      eliminate the variable.

   3. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.
   4. Substitute that value into one of the original equations and solve for the

      second variable.
   5. Check the solution by substituting the values into the other equation.

Example:

   Solving a System by the Addition Method

   Solve the given system of equations by addition.
   Equation:

                                                                            x + 2y = -1
                                                                            -x + y = 3

   Solution:

   Both equations are already set equal to a constant. Notice that the
   coefficient of x in the second equation, -1, is the opposite of the
   coefficient of x in the first equation, 1. We can add the two equations to
   eliminate x without needing to multiply by a constant.
   Equation:

                                                                            x + 2y = -1
                                                                            -x + y = 3

                                                                                    3y = 2
                 y

Now that we have eliminated x, we can solve the resulting equation for y.
Equation:

                                                                              3y = 2

                                                                                                                                2

                                                                              y=

                                                                                                                                3

Then, we substitute this value for y into one of the original equations and
solve for x.
Equation:

           -x + y = 3

           -x +     2                  =3

Analysis

We gain an important perspective on systems of equations by looking at the
graphical representation. See [link] to find that the equations intersect at the
solution. We do not need to ask whether there may be a second solution
because observing the graph confirms that the system has exactly one solution.

   Solve the given system of equations by the addition method.
   Equation:

                                                                              x - 2y = 11

   Solution:
Adding these equations as presented will not eliminate a variable.
However, we see that the first equation has 3x in it and the second
equation has x. So if we multiply the second equation by -3, the x-terms
will add to zero.
Equation:

x-2y = 11             Multiply both sides by -3.
-3(x-2y) = -3(11)     Use the distributive property.
-3x + 6y = -33

Now, let's add them.
Equation:

                                                                       3x + 5y = -11
                                                               -3x + 6y = -33

                                                                                                    _______________

                                                                                      y = -4

For the last step, we substitute y = -4 into one of the original equations
and solve for x.
Equation:

                                                                     3x + 5y = -11

                                                                     3x - 20 = -11

Our solution is the ordered pair (3, -4). See [link]. Check the solution in

   Solution:

   One equation has 2x and the other has 5x. The least common multiple is
   10x so we will have to multiply both equations by a constant in order to

              2     4

              2x - y = 4

Now multiply the second equation by -1 so that we can eliminate the x-
variable.
Equation:

                                                            -1(2x - y) = -1(4)

Add the two equations to eliminate the x-variable and solve the resulting
equation.
Equation:
                                  2x + y = 18

Substitute y = 7 into the first equation.

Identifying Inconsistent Systems of Equations Containing Two
Variables

Now that we have several methods for solving systems of equations, we can use
the methods to identify inconsistent systems. Recall that an inconsistent system
consists of parallel lines that have the same slope but different y -intercepts.
They will never intersect. When searching for a solution to an inconsistent
system, we will come up with a false statement, such as 12 = 0.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Solving an Inconsistent System of Equations
   Solve the following system of equations.
   Equation:

                                                                              x = 9-2y
                                                                              x + 2y = 13

   Solution:
   We can approach this problem in two ways. Because one equation is
   already solved for x, the most obvious step is to use substitution.
   Equation:
          x + 2y = 13
          (9 - 2y) + 2y = 13
          9 + 0y = 13
          9 = 13

Clearly, this statement is a contradiction because 9  13. Therefore, the
system has no solution.

The second approach would be to first manipulate the equations so that
they are both in slope-intercept form. We manipulate the first equation as
follows.
Equation:

          x = 9-2y

          2y = -x + 9

             1            9

          y = - x+
             2            2

We then convert the second equation expressed to slope-intercept form.
Equation:

          x + 2y = 13

          2y = -x + 13

             1            13

          y = - x+
             2            2

Comparing the equations, we see that they have the same slope but
different y-intercepts. Therefore, the lines are parallel and do not intersect.
Equation:

          1            9

          y = - x+
          2            2

          1            13

          y = - x+
          2            2

Analysis
Writing the equations in slope-intercept form confirms that the system is
inconsistent because all lines will intersect eventually unless they are parallel.
Parallel lines will never intersect; thus, the two lines have no points in
common. The graphs of the equations in this example are shown in [link].

                                                                              2y-2x = 6

   Solution:
   No solution. It is an inconsistent system.
Expressing the Solution of a System of Dependent Equations
Containing Two Variables

Recall that a dependent system of equations in two variables is a system in
which the two equations represent the same line. Dependent systems have an
infinite number of solutions because all of the points on one line are also on the
other line. After using substitution or addition, the resulting equation will be an
identity, such as 0 = 0.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding a Solution to a Dependent System of Linear Equations

   Find a solution to the system of equations using the addition method.
   Equation:

                                                                                  x + 3y = 2
                                                                              3x + 9y = 6

   Solution:

   With the addition method, we want to eliminate one of the variables by
   adding the equations. In this case, let's focus on eliminating x. If we
   multiply both sides of the first equation by -3, then we will be able to
   eliminate the x -variable.
   Equation:

                                                                  x + 3y = 2
                                                               (-3)(x + 3y) = (-3)(2)

                                                                  -3x - 9y = -6

   Now add the equations.
   Equation:
                   -3x - 9y = -6
               + 3x + 9y = 6

                  ______________
                   0 =0

   We can see that there will be an infinite number of solutions that satisfy
   both equations.

Analysis

If we rewrote both equations in the slope-intercept form, we might know what
the solution would look like before adding. Let's look at what happens when
we convert the system to slope-intercept form.
Equation:

               x + 3y = 2

               3y = -x + 2

                            1  2
               y = - x+
                            3  3

               3x + 9y = 6

               9y = -3x + 6

                            3  6
               y = - x+
                            9  9

                            1  2
               y = - x+
                            3  3

Using Systems of Equations to Investigate Profits
Using what we have learned about systems of equations, we can return to the
skateboard manufacturing problem at the beginning of the section. The
skateboard manufacturer's revenue function is the function used to calculate
the amount of money that comes into the business. It can be represented by the
equation R = xp, where x = quantity and p = price. The revenue function is
shown in orange in [link].
The cost function is the function used to calculate the costs of doing business.
It includes fixed costs, such as rent and salaries, and variable costs, such as
utilities. The cost function is shown in blue in [link]. The x -axis represents
quantity in hundreds of units. The y-axis represents either cost or revenue in
hundreds of dollars.

The point at which the two lines intersect is called the break-even point. We
can see from the graph that if 700 units are produced, the cost is $3,300 and the
revenue is also $3,300. In other words, the company breaks even if they
produce and sell 700 units. They neither make money nor lose money.
The shaded region to the right of the break-even point represents quantities for
which the company makes a profit. The shaded region to the left represents
quantities for which the company suffers a loss. The profit function is the
revenue function minus the cost function, written as P (x) = R(x) - C(x).
Clearly, knowing the quantity for which the cost equals the revenue is of great
importance to businesses.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding the Break-Even Point and the Profit Function Using
   Substitution

   Given the cost function C(x) = 0.85x + 35,000 and the revenue
   function R(x) = 1.55x, find the break-even point and the profit function.

   Solution:

   Write the system of equations using y to replace function notation.
   Equation:

                                                                    y = 0.85x + 35,000
                                                                    y = 1.55x

   Substitute the expression 0.85x + 35,000 from the first equation into the
   second equation and solve for x.
   Equation:

                                                               0.85x + 35,000 = 1.55x
                                                                             35,000 = 0.7x
                                                                                 50,000 = x

   Then, we substitute x = 50,000 into either the cost function or the
   revenue function.
Equation:

           1.55 (50,000) = 77,500

The break-even point is (50,000, 77,500).

The profit function is found using the formula P (x) = R(x) - C(x).
Equation:

                                           P (x) = 1.55x - (0.85x + 35, 000)
                                                            = 0.7x - 35, 000

   The profit function is P (x) = 0.7x-35,000.
Analysis

The cost to produce 50,000 units is $77,500, and the revenue from the sales of
50,000 units is also $77,500. To make a profit, the business must produce and
sell more than 50,000 units. See [link].
We see from the graph in [link] that the profit function has a negative value
until x = 50,000, when the graph crosses the x-axis. Then, the graph emerges
into positive y-values and continues on this path as the profit function is a
straight line. This illustrates that the break-even point for businesses occurs
when the profit function is 0. The area to the left of the break-even point
represents operating at a loss.

Example:

   Problem:
   Writing and Solving a System of Equations in Two Variables
   The cost of a ticket to the circus is $25.00 for children and $50.00 for
   adults. On a certain day, attendance at the circus is 2,000 and the total
   gate revenue is $70,000. How many children and how many adults
   bought tickets?
   Solution:
   Let c = the number of children and a = the number of adults in attendance.
The total number of people is 2,000. We can use this to write an equation
for the number of people at the circus that day.
Equation:

                                                                     c + a = 2,000

The revenue from all children can be found by multiplying $25.00 by the
number of children, 25c. The revenue from all adults can be found by
multiplying $50.00 by the number of adults, 50a. The total revenue is
$70,000. We can use this to write an equation for the revenue.
Equation:

                                                             25c + 50a = 70,000

We now have a system of linear equations in two variables.
Equation:

                                                                       c + a = 2,000
                                                             25c + 50a = 70,000

In the first equation, the coefficient of both variables is 1. We can quickly
solve the first equation for either c or a. We will solve for a.
Equation:

                                                                     c + a = 2,000
                                                                     a = 2,000 - c

Substitute the expression 2,000 - c in the second equation for a and solve
for c.
Equation:

                                                25c + 50(2,000 - c) = 70,000
                                                25c + 100,000 - 50c = 70,000
                                                -25c = -30,000
                                                c = 1,200
   Substitute c = 1,200 into the first equation to solve for a.
   Equation:

                                                                      1,200 + a = 2,000
                                                                      a = 800

   We find that 1,200 children and 800 adults bought tickets to the circus
   that day.

Note:

      Solving Systems of Equations Using Elimination
      Applications of Systems of Equations

Key Concepts
      A system of linear equations consists of two or more equations made up of
      two or more variables such that all equations in the system are considered
      simultaneously.
      The solution to a system of linear equations in two variables is any ordered
      pair that satisfies each equation independently. See [link].
      Systems of equations are classified as independent with one solution,
      dependent with an infinite number of solutions, or inconsistent with no
      solution.
      One method of solving a system of linear equations in two variables is by
      graphing. In this method, we graph the equations on the same set of axes.
      See [link].
      Another method of solving a system of linear equations is by substitution.
      In this method, we solve for one variable in one equation and substitute the
      result into the second equation. See [link].
      A third method of solving a system of linear equations is by addition, in
      which we can eliminate a variable by adding opposite coefficients of
      corresponding variables. See [link].
      It is often necessary to multiply one or both equations by a constant to
      facilitate elimination of a variable when adding the two equations together.
      See [link], [link], and [link].
      Either method of solving a system of equations results in a false statement
      for inconsistent systems because they are made up of parallel lines that
      never intersect. See [link].
      The solution to a system of dependent equations will always be true
      because both equations describe the same line. See [link].
      Systems of equations can be used to solve real-world problems that
      involve more than one variable, such as those relating to revenue, cost, and
      profit. See [link] and [link].

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

 Determine whether an ordered triple is a solution of a system of three linear equations
 with three variables (IA 4.4.1)
 Solve a system of three linear equations with three variables (IA 4.4.2)

Objective 1: Determine whether an ordered triple is a solution of a system of three linear
equations with three variables (IA 4.4.1)

A linear equation with three variables where a, b, c, and d are real numbers and a, b, and c are
not all 0, is of the form ax + by + cz = d . The graph of a linear equation with three variables is a
plane.

A system of linear equations with three variables is a set of linear equations with three variables.
For example,
Equation:

                                                                                                    3x + y + z = 2
                                                                                                 x + 2y + z = -3
                                                                                                  3x + y + 2z = 4

is a system of linear equations with three variables.

Solutions of a system of equations are the values of the variables that make all the equations true.
A solution is represented by an ordered triple (x,y,z).

Example:
Determine whether the ordered triples are solutions to the given system.
Exercise:

Problem:   3x + y + z = 2

           x + 2y + z = -3 at (1, - 3, 2) and at (4, - 1, - 5)

           3x + y + 2z = 4

Solution:
We substitute 1, -3, 2 into all three equations:

3x + y + z = 2          x + 2y + z = -3                   3x + y + 2z = 4

3(1) + (-3) + 2 = 2     1 + 2(-3) + 2 = -3                3(1) + (-3) + 2(2) = 4

       2=2                            -3 = -3                    4=4

True                    True                              True

Conclusion: Since (1,-3,2) is a solution to all three equations, then it is a solution to the
system

       3x + y + z = 2

     x + 2y + z = -3

      3x + y + 2z = 4

Next we substitute (4, -1, -5) into all three equations:

3x + y + z = 2          x + 2y + z = -3                   3x + y + 2z = 4

3(4) + (-1) + (-5) = 2  4 + 2(-1) + (-5) = -3             3(4) + (-1) + 2(-5) = 4

       6=2                    -3 = -3                                                                     1=4

False                   True                              False

Conclusion: Since (4,-1,-5) is not a solution to all three equations, then it is not a solution
to the system

       3x + y + z = 2

     x + 2y + z = -3

      3x + y + 2z = 4

                                                            3x- 4y- 3z = 2 at (3, 1, 3) and at (4, 3, 7)
                                                            2x + y- 2z = 3

                                           x + 3y + z = 4

                                                   x + 2y - z = 1
                                                                                  x + 2(-2z + 3) - z = 1
                                                                                              x - 4z + 6 - z = 1

Understanding the correct approach to setting up problems such as this one makes finding a solution a matter of
following a pattern. We will solve this and similar problems involving three equations and three variables in this
section. Doing so uses similar techniques as those used to solve systems of two equations in two variables.
However, finding solutions to systems of three equations requires a bit more organization and a touch of visual
gymnastics.

Solving Systems of Three Equations in Three Variables

In order to solve systems of equations in three variables, known as three-by-three systems, the primary tool we will
be using is called Gaussian elimination, named after the prolific German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss.
While there is no definitive order in which operations are to be performed, there are specific guidelines as to what
type of moves can be made. We may number the equations to keep track of the steps we apply. The goal is to
eliminate one variable at a time to achieve upper triangular form, the ideal form for a three-by-three system
because it allows for straightforward back-substitution to find a solution (x, y, z), which we call an ordered triple.
A system in upper triangular form looks like the following:
Equation:

                                                                                                            Ax + By + Cz = D
                                                                                                                 Ey + F z = G
                                                                                                                 Hz = K

The third equation can be solved for z, and then we back-substitute to find y and x. To write the system in
upper triangular form, we can perform the following operations:

   1. Interchange the order of any two equations.
   2. Multiply both sides of an equation by a nonzero constant.
   3. Add a nonzero multiple of one equation to another equation.
The solution set to a three-by-three system is an ordered triple {(x, y, z)}. Graphically, the ordered triple
defines the point that is the intersection of three planes in space. You can visualize such an intersection by
imagining any corner in a rectangular room. A corner is defined by three planes: two adjoining walls and the floor
(or ceiling). Any point where two walls and the floor meet represents the intersection of three planes.

Note:
Number of Possible Solutions
[link] and [link] illustrate possible solution scenarios for three-by-three systems.

      Systems that have a single solution are those which, after elimination, result in a solution set consisting of an
      ordered triple {(x, y, z)}. Graphically, the ordered triple defines a point that is the intersection of three
      planes in space.
      Systems that have an infinite number of solutions are those which, after elimination, result in an expression
      that is always true, such as 0 = 0. Graphically, an infinite number of solutions represents a line or coincident
      plane that serves as the intersection of three planes in space.
      Systems that have no solution are those that, after elimination, result in a statement that is a contradiction,
      such as 3 = 0. Graphically, a system with no solution is represented by three planes with no point in
      common.

     (a)Three planes intersect at a single point, representing a three-by-three
         system with a single solution. (b) Three planes intersect in a line,
representing a three-by-three system with infinite solutions.

All three figures represent three-by-three systems with no solution. (a) The
three planes intersect with each other, but not at a common point. (b) Two
  of the planes are parallel and intersect with the third plane, but not with

     each other. (c) All three planes are parallel, so there is no point of
                                     intersection.

   Problem:
   Determining Whether an Ordered Triple Is a Solution to a System

   Determine whether the ordered triple (3, -2, 1) is a solution to the system.
   Equation:

                                                                                                                x+y+z = 2
                                                                                                                6x - 4y + 5z = 31
                                                                                                           5x + 2y + 2z = 13

Solution:
We will check each equation by substituting in the values of the ordered triple for x, y, and z.

The ordered triple (3, -2, 1) is indeed a solution to the system.

   Problem:
   Solving a System of Three Equations in Three Variables by Elimination

   Find a solution to the following system:
   Equation:

                                                                                                                x-2y + 3z = 9 (1)
                                                                                                      -x + 3y - z = -6 (2)

                                                                                                           2x-5y + 5z = 17 (3)

Solution:

There will always be several choices as to where to begin, but the most obvious first step here is to eliminate
x by adding equations (1) and (2).
Equation:

x - 2y + 3z = 9                                              (1)

- x + 3y - z = -6                                            (2)

y + 2z = 3                                              (3)

The second step is multiplying equation (1) by -2  and adding the result to equation (3). These two steps
will eliminate the variable x.
Equation:

-2x + 4y - 6z = -18 (1) multiplied by - 2

2x - 5y + 5z = 17                                  (3)
____________________________________

- y - z = -1 (5)

In equations (4) and (5), we have created a new two-by-two system. We can solve for z                                              by adding the two
equations.
Equation:

y + 2z = 3                                              (4)

-y - z = -1 (5)

z=2                                                     (6)

Choosing one equation from each new system, we obtain the upper triangular form:
Equation:
x-2y + 3z = 9                                               (1)
    y + 2z = 3                                              (4)
    z=2                                                     (6)

Next, we back-substitute z = 2 into equation (4) and solve for y.
Equation:

                                                                                                               y + 2(2) = 3
                                                                                                               y+4 = 3

                                                                                                                    y = -1

Finally, we can back-substitute z = 2 and y = -1 into equation (1). This will yield the solution for x.
Equation:

                                                                                                     x-2(-1) + 3(2) = 9
                                                                                                                      x+2+6 = 9
                                                                                                                                           x=1

The solution is the ordered triple (1, -1, 2). See [link].

Exercise:

   Problem:
   Solving a Real-World Problem Using a System of Three Equations in Three Variables

   In the problem posed at the beginning of the section, John invested his inheritance of $12,000 in three
   different funds: part in a money-market fund paying 3% interest annually; part in municipal bonds paying
   4% annually; and the rest in mutual funds paying 7% annually. John invested $4,000 more in mutual funds
   than he invested in municipal bonds. The total interest earned in one year was $670. How much did he invest
   in each type of fund?

   Solution:

   To solve this problem, we use all of the information given and set up three equations. First, we assign a
   variable to each of the three investment amounts:
   Equation:
x = amount invested in money-market f und
y = amount invested in municipal bonds
z = amount invested in mutual f unds

The first equation indicates that the sum of the three principal amounts is $12,000.
Equation:

                                                                                                       x + y + z = 12,000

We form the second equation according to the information that John invested $4,000 more in mutual funds
than he invested in municipal bonds.
Equation:

                                                                                                              z = y + 4,000

The third equation shows that the total amount of interest earned from each fund equals $670.
Equation:

                                                                                          0.03x + 0.04y + 0.07z = 670

Then, we write the three equations as a system.
Equation:

                                                                                               x + y + z = 12,000
                                                                                                 - y + z = 4,000
                                                                                          0.03x + 0.04y + 0.07z = 670

To make the calculations simpler, we can multiply the third equation by 100. Thus,
Equation:

x + y + z = 12,000 (1)

- y + z = 4,000        (2)

3x + 4y + 7z = 67,000  (3)

Step 1. Interchange equation (2) and equation (3) so that the two equations with three variables will line up.
Equation:

                                                                                                    x + y + z = 12,000
                                                                                               3x + 4y + 7z = 67,000

                                                                                                      - y + z = 4,000

Step 2. Multiply equation (1) by -3 and add to equation (2). Write the result as row 2.
Equation:

                                                                                                    x + y + z = 12,000
                                                                                                    y + 4z = 31,000

                                                                                                          - y + z = 4,000

Step 3. Add equation (2) to equation (3) and write the result as equation (3).
Equation:

           x + y + z = 12,000
               y + 4z = 31,000
               5z = 35,000

Step 4. Solve for z in equation (3). Back-substitute that value in equation (2) and solve for y.                               Then, back-
substitute the values for z and y into equation (1) and solve for x.
Equation:

           5z = 35,000
           z = 7,000

           y + 4(7,000) = 31,000
           y = 3,000

                                                                                            x + 3,000 + 7,000 = 12,000
                                                                                                 x = 2,000

John invested $2,000 in a money-market fund, $3,000 in municipal bonds, and $7,000 in mutual funds.

Identifying Inconsistent Systems of Equations Containing Three Variables

Just as with systems of equations in two variables, we may come across an inconsistent system of equations in
three variables, which means that it does not have a solution that satisfies all three equations. The equations could
represent three parallel planes, two parallel planes and one intersecting plane, or three planes that intersect the
other two but not at the same location. The process of elimination will result in a false statement, such as 3 = 7
or some other contradiction.
Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Solving an Inconsistent System of Three Equations in Three Variables

   Solve the following system.
   Equation:

x-3y + z = 4                                                        (1)

               - x + 2y-5z = 3 (2)

5x-13y + 13z = 8                                                    (3)

Solution:

Looking at the coefficients of x, we can see that we can eliminate x by adding equation (1) to equation (2).
Equation:

                                                                                                   x-3y + z = 4 (1)
                                                                                                   -x + 2y-5z = 3 (2)

                                                                                                             - y-4z = 7 (4)

Next, we multiply equation (1) by -5 and add it to equation (3).
Equation:

-5x + 15y - 5z = -20     (1) multiplied by -5

5x - 13y + 13z = 8       (3)
______________________________________

2y + 8z = -12       (5)

Then, we multiply equation (4) by 2 and add it to equation (5).
Equation:

                                                                            -2y - 8z = 14(4) multiplied by 2
                                                                                 2y + 8z = -12 (5)

                                                                                                                      _______________________________________

                                                                                 0=2

   The final equation 0 = 2 is a contradiction, so we conclude that the system of equations in inconsistent and,
   therefore, has no solution.
Analysis

In this system, each plane intersects the other two, but not at the same location. Therefore, the system is
inconsistent.

No solution.

Expressing the Solution of a System of Dependent Equations Containing Three Variables

We know from working with systems of equations in two variables that a dependent system of equations has an
infinite number of solutions. The same is true for dependent systems of equations in three variables. An infinite
number of solutions can result from several situations. The three planes could be the same, so that a solution to one
equation will be the solution to the other two equations. All three equations could be different but they intersect on
a line, which has infinite solutions. Or two of the equations could be the same and intersect the third on a line.

                                                                                                           4x + 2y-6z = 0 (2)

                                                                                                                 x - y + z = 0 (3)

Solution:

First, we can multiply equation (1) by -2 and add it to equation (2).
Equation:

              -4x-2y + 6z = 0 equation(1) multiplied by -2

              4x + 2y-6z = 0  (2)
              ____________________________________________

              0=0

We do not need to proceed any further. The result we get is an identity, 0 = 0, which tells us that this system
has an infinite number of solutions. There are other ways to begin to solve this system, such as multiplying
equation (3) by -2, and adding it to equation (1). We then perform the same steps as above and find the
same result, 0 = 0.

When a system is dependent, we can find general expressions for the solutions. Adding equations (1) and (3),
we have

                                                         x-y+z = 0

We then solve the resulting equation for z.

                                                     3x-2z = 0

                                                                             3

                                                                             2

We back-substitute the expression for z into one of the equations and solve for y.

So  the   general  solution  is  (x,  5      3       In this solution, x        can be any real number. The values of y                                                                        and

                                         x,     x).

                                      2      2

z are dependent on the value selected for x.

Analysis

As shown in [link], two of the planes are the same and they intersect the third plane on a line. The solution set is
infinite, as all points along the intersection line will satisfy all three equations.

Note:
Does the generic solution to a dependent system always have to be written in terms of x?
No, you can write the generic solution in terms of any of the variables, but it is common to write it in terms of x
and if needed x and y.

Key Concepts

      A solution set is an ordered triple {(x, y, z)} that represents the intersection of three planes in space. See
      [link].
      A system of three equations in three variables can be solved by using a series of steps that forces a variable to
      be eliminated. The steps include interchanging the order of equations, multiplying both sides of an equation
      by a nonzero constant, and adding a nonzero multiple of one equation to another equation. See [link].
      Systems of three equations in three variables are useful for solving many different types of real-world
      problems. See [link].
      A system of equations in three variables is inconsistent if no solution exists. After performing elimination
      operations, the result is a contradiction. See [link].
      Systems of equations in three variables that are inconsistent could result from three parallel planes, two
      parallel planes and one intersecting plane, or three planes that intersect the other two but not at the same
      location.
      A system of equations in three variables is dependent if it has an infinite number of solutions. After
      performing elimination operations, the result is an identity. See [link].
      Systems of equations in three variables that are dependent could result from three identical planes, three
      planes intersecting at a line, or two identical planes that intersect the third on a line.

Section Exercises

Verbal

Exercise:

   Problem: Can a linear system of three equations have exactly two solutions? Explain why or why not

   Solution:

   No, there can be only one, zero, or infinitely many solutions.
Exercise:
   Problem:

   If a given ordered triple solves the system of equations, is that solution unique? If so, explain why. If not, give
   an example where it is not unique.
Exercise:
   Problem:

   If a given ordered triple does not solve the system of equations, is there no solution? If so, explain why. If not,
   give an example.

   Solution:

   Not necessarily. There could be zero, one, or infinitely many solutions. For example, (0, 0, 0) is not a
   solution to the system below, but that does not mean that it has no solution.

          2x + 3y-6z = 1
     -4x-6y + 12z = -2

          x + 2y + 5z = 10

Exercise:

   Problem: Using the method of addition, is there only one way to solve the system?
Exercise:

   Problem:

   Can you explain whether there can be only one method to solve a linear system of equations? If yes, give an
   example of such a system of equations. If not, explain why not.

   Solution:

   Every system of equations can be solved graphically, by substitution, and by addition. However, systems of
   three equations become very complex to solve graphically so other methods are usually preferable.

As we embark on our study of calculus, we shall see how its development
arose from common solutions to practical problems in areas such as
engineering physics--like the space travel problem posed in the chapter
opener. Two key problems led to the initial formulation of calculus: (1) the
tangent problem, or how to determine the slope of a line tangent to a curve
at a point; and (2) the area problem, or how to determine the area under a
curve.

The Tangent Problem and Differential Calculus

Rate of change is one of the most critical concepts in calculus. We begin
our investigation of rates of change by looking at the graphs of the three
lines f (x) = -2x - 3, g (x) = 21 x + 1, and h (x) = 2, shown in [link].
The rate of change of a linear function is constant in each of these
      three graphs, with the constant determined by the slope.

As we move from left to right along the graph of f (x) = -2x - 3, we see
that the graph decreases at a constant rate. For every 1 unit we move to the
right along the x-axis, the y-coordinate decreases by 2 units. This rate of
change is determined by the slope (-2) of the line. Similarly, the slope of
1/2 in the function g (x) tells us that for every change in x of 1 unit there is
a corresponding change in y of 1/2 unit. The function h (x) = 2 has a slope
of zero, indicating that the values of the function remain constant. We see
that the slope of each linear function indicates the rate of change of the
function.

Compare  the  graphs  of  these  three  functions  with  the  graph  of  k  (x)  =      2

                                                                                    x

([link]). The graph of k (x) = x2 starts from the left by decreasing rapidly,

then begins to decrease more slowly and level off, and then finally begins to

increase--slowly at first, followed by an increasing rate of increase as it

moves toward the right. Unlike a linear function, no single number

represents the rate of change for this function. We quite naturally ask: How

do we measure the rate of change of a nonlinear function?
The  function  k  (x)  =      2  does  not  have  a  constant  rate

                          x

                          of change.

We can approximate the rate of change of a function f (x) at a point
(a, f (a)) on its graph by taking another point (x, f (x)) on the graph of
f (x), drawing a line through the two points, and calculating the slope of
the resulting line. Such a line is called a secant line. [link] shows a secant
line to a function f (x) at a point (a, f (a)).
 The slope of a secant line through a point (a, f (a))
estimates the rate of change of the function at the point

                                                   (a, f (a)).

We formally define a secant line as follows:

Note:
Definition
The secant to the function f (x) through the points (a, f (a)) and
(x, f (x)) is the line passing through these points. Its slope is given by
Equation:

msec =  f (x) - f (a)
                                         .

                 x-a
The accuracy of approximating the rate of change of the function with a
secant line depends on how close x is to a. As we see in [link], if x is closer
to a, the slope of the secant line is a better measure of the rate of change of
f (x) at a.

       As x gets closer to a, the slope of the secant line
   becomes a better approximation to the rate of change of

                       the function f (x) at a.

The secant lines themselves approach a line that is called the tangent to the
function f (x) at a ([link]). The slope of the tangent line to the graph at a
measures the rate of change of the function at a. This value also represents
the derivative of the function f (x) at a, or the rate of change of the
function at a. This derivative is denoted by f  (a). Differential calculus is
the field of calculus concerned with the study of derivatives and their
applications.

manipulate yourself, visit this applet (Note: this site requires a Java

    Solving the Tangent Problem: As x approaches a, the
             secant lines approach the tangent line.

[link] illustrates how to find slopes of secant lines. These slopes estimate
the slope of the tangent line or, equivalently, the rate of change of the
function at the point at which the slopes are calculated.

Finding Slopes of Secant Lines

Estimate the slope of the tangent line (rate of change) to f (x) = x2 at

x = 1 by finding slopes of secant lines through (1, 1) and each of the

following  points  on  the             graph  of  f  (x)  =      2

                                                             x.

Solution:

Use the formula for the slope of a secant line from the definition.

a. msec =     4-1      =3              = 2.5
b. msec =
              2-1                   5

                9       =

                3

                   -1

                2

The point in part b. is closer to the point (1, 1), so the slope of 2.5 is
closer to the slope of the tangent line. A good estimate for the slope of
the tangent would be in the range of 2 to 2.5 ([link]).

We continue our investigation by exploring a related question. Keeping in
mind that velocity may be thought of as the rate of change of position,
suppose that we have a function, s (t), that gives the position of an object
along a coordinate axis at any given time t. Can we use these same ideas to
create a reasonable definition of the instantaneous velocity at a given time
t = a? We start by approximating the instantaneous velocity with an
average velocity. First, recall that the speed of an object traveling at a
constant rate is the ratio of the distance traveled to the length of time it has
traveled. We define the average velocity of an object over a time period to
be the change in its position divided by the length of the time period.

Note:
Definition
Let s (t) be the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis at
time t. The average velocity of the object over a time interval [a, t] where
a < t (or [t, a] if t < a) is
Equation:

             vave =  s (t) - s (a)
                                                    .

                             t-a
As t is chosen closer to a, the average velocity becomes closer to the
instantaneous velocity. Note that finding the average velocity of a position
function over a time interval is essentially the same as finding the slope of a
secant line to a function. Furthermore, to find the slope of a tangent line at a
point a, we let the x-values approach a in the slope of the secant line.
Similarly, to find the instantaneous velocity at time a, we let the t-values
approach a in the average velocity. This process of letting x or t approach a
in an expression is called taking a limit. Thus, we may define the
instantaneous velocity as follows.

Note:
Definition
For a position function s (t), the instantaneous velocity at a time t = a is
the value that the average velocities approach on intervals of the form [a, t]
and [t, a] as the values of t become closer to a, provided such a value
exists.

[link] illustrates this concept of limits and average velocity.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Finding Average Velocity
A rock is dropped from a height of 64 ft. It is determined that its

height (in feet) above ground t seconds later (for 0  t  2) is given

by  s  (t)  =                     2  +  64.  Find  the  average  velocity  of  the  rock  over

                -16t

each of the given time intervals. Use this information to guess the

instantaneous velocity of the rock at time t = 0.5.

    a. [0.49, 0.5]
    b. [0.5, 0.51]

Solution:

Substitute the data into the formula for the definition of average
velocity.

    a. vave =      s(0.5)-s(0.49)            = -15.84
    b. vave =             0.5-0.49           = -16.16

                   s(0.51)-s(0.5)
                          0.51-0.5

The instantaneous velocity is somewhere between -15.84 and -16.16
ft/sec. A good guess might be -16 ft/sec.

The Area Problem and Integral Calculus

We now turn our attention to a classic question from calculus. Many
quantities in physics--for example, quantities of work--may be interpreted
as the area under a curve. This leads us to ask the question: How can we
find the area between the graph of a function and the x-axis over an interval
([link])?

     The Area Problem: How do we
   find the area of the shaded region?

As in the answer to our previous questions on velocity, we first try to
approximate the solution. We approximate the area by dividing up the
interval [a, b] into smaller intervals in the shape of rectangles. The
approximation of the area comes from adding up the areas of these
rectangles ([link]).
 The area of the region under the
curve is approximated by summing

    the areas of thin rectangles.

As the widths of the rectangles become smaller (approach zero), the sums
of the areas of the rectangles approach the area between the graph of f (x)
and the x-axis over the interval [a, b]. Once again, we find ourselves taking
a limit. Limits of this type serve as a basis for the definition of the definite
integral. Integral calculus is the study of integrals and their applications.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Estimation Using Rectangles

Estimate  the  area  between  the  x-axis  and  the  graph  of  f  (x)  =      2  +  1

over the interval [0, 3] by using the three rectangles shown in [link].
     The area of the region under the
     curve of f (x) = x2 + 1 can be

        estimated using rectangles.

Solution:
The areas of the three rectangles are 1 unit2, 2 unit2, and 5 unit2.
Using these rectangles, our area estimate is 8 unit2.

Other Aspects of Calculus

So far, we have studied functions of one variable only. Such functions can
be represented visually using graphs in two dimensions; however, there is
no good reason to restrict our investigation to two dimensions. Suppose, for
example, that instead of determining the velocity of an object moving along
a coordinate axis, we want to determine the velocity of a rock fired from a
catapult at a given time, or of an airplane moving in three dimensions. We
might want to graph real-value functions of two variables or determine
volumes of solids of the type shown in [link]. These are only a few of the
types of questions that can be asked and answered using multivariable
calculus. Informally, multivariable calculus can be characterized as the
study of the calculus of functions of two or more variables. However,
before exploring these and other ideas, we must first lay a foundation for
the study of calculus in one variable by exploring the concept of a limit.

   We can use multivariable calculus
 to find the volume between a
surface defined by a function of

   two variables and a plane.

Key Concepts

      Differential calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of
      determining the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a point. The slope
      of the tangent line indicates the rate of change of the function, also
      called the derivative. Calculating a derivative requires finding a limit.
      Integral calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of finding the
      area of a region between the graph of a function and the x-axis. We can
      approximate the area by dividing it into thin rectangles and summing
      the areas of these rectangles. This summation leads to the value of a
      function called the integral. The integral is also calculated by finding a
      limit and, in fact, is related to the derivative of a function.
      Multivariable calculus enables us to solve problems in three-
      dimensional space, including determining motion in space and finding
      volumes of solids.

The concept of a limit or limiting process, essential to the understanding of calculus,
has been around for thousands of years. In fact, early mathematicians used a limiting
process to obtain better and better approximations of areas of circles. Yet, the formal
definition of a limit--as we know and understand it today--did not appear until the
late 19th century. We therefore begin our quest to understand limits, as our
mathematical ancestors did, by using an intuitive approach. At the end of this chapter,
armed with a conceptual understanding of limits, we examine the formal definition of a
limit.

We begin our exploration of limits by taking a look at the graphs of the functions
Equation:

f (x) =  x2 - 4                      |x - 2|                                  1
                          , g (x) =                    , and h (x) =
                                                                                            ,
          x-2                         x-2
                                                                                                2

                                                                      (x - 2)

which are shown in [link]. In particular, let's focus our attention on the behavior of
each graph at and around x = 2.
       These graphs show the behavior of three different functions around x = 2.

Each of the three functions is undefined at x = 2, but if we make this statement and no
other, we give a very incomplete picture of how each function behaves in the vicinity
of x = 2. To express the behavior of each graph in the vicinity of 2 more completely,
we need to introduce the concept of a limit.

Intuitive Definition of a Limit

Let's first take a closer look at how the function f (x) = (x2 - 4)/(x - 2) behaves
around x = 2 in [link]. As the values of x approach 2 from either side of 2, the values
of y = f (x) approach 4. Mathematically, we say that the limit of f (x) as x
approaches 2 is 4. Symbolically, we express this limit as
Equation:

                                                                                     lim f (x) = 4.

                                                                                                                        x2

From this very brief informal look at one limit, let's start to develop an intuitive
definition of the limit. We can think of the limit of a function at a number a as being
the one real number L that the functional values approach as the x-values approach a,
provided such a real number L exists. Stated more carefully, we have the following
definition:
Note:
Definition
Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a, with the
possible exception of a itself, and let L be a real number. If all values of the function
f (x) approach the real number L as the values of x ( a) approach the number a,
then we say that the limit of f (x) as x approaches a is L. (More succinct, as x gets
closer to a, f (x) gets closer and stays close to L.) Symbolically, we express this idea
as
Equation:

                                                                                    lim f (x) = L.

                                                                                                                       xa

We can estimate limits by constructing tables of functional values and by looking at
their graphs. This process is described in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Evaluating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values

   1. To evaluate limf (x), we begin by completing a table of functional values. We

                                                         xa

      should choose two sets of x-values--one set of values approaching a and less
      than a, and another set of values approaching a and greater than a. [link]
      demonstrates what your tables might look like.

x           f (x)           x           f (x)
            f (a - 0.1)                 f (a + 0.1)
a - 0.1     f (a - 0.01)    a + 0.1     f (a + 0.01)
a - 0.01    f (a - 0.001)   a + 0.01    f (a + 0.001)
a - 0.001   f (a - 0.0001)  a + 0.001   f (a + 0.0001)
a - 0.0001                  a + 0.0001
x  f (x)                                                                                                  x  f (x)

Use additional values as                                                                                  Use additional values as
necessary.                                                                                                necessary.

Table of Functional Values for limf (x)

                                                                                                      xa

2. Next, let's look at the values in each of the f (x) columns and determine whether
  the values seem to be approaching a single value as we move down each column.
  In our columns, we look at the sequence
  f (a - 0.1), f (a - 0.01), f (a - 0.001). , f (a - 0.0001), and so on, and
  f (a + 0.1), f (a + 0.01), f (a + 0.001), f (a + 0.0001), and so on. (Note:

  Although we have chosen the x-values
  a ± 0.1, a ± 0.01, a ± 0.001, a ± 0.0001, and so forth, and these values will
  probably work nearly every time, on very rare occasions we may need to modify
  our choices.)
3. If both columns approach a common y-value L, we state limf (x) = L. We can

                                                                                                                                                                                                   xa

  use the following strategy to confirm the result obtained from the table or as an
  alternative method for estimating a limit.
4. Using a graphing calculator or computer software that allows us graph functions,
  we can plot the function f (x), making sure the functional values of f (x) for x-
  values near a are in our window. We can use the trace feature to move along the
  graph of the function and watch the y-value readout as the x-values approach a. If
  the y-values approach L as our x-values approach a from both directions, then
   limf (x) = L. We may need to zoom in on our graph and repeat this process

        xa

  several times.

We apply this Problem-Solving Strategy to compute a limit in [link].

As we read down each x column, we see that the values in each column
appear to be approaching one. Thus, it is fairly reasonable to conclude that

lim x sinx = 1. A calculator or computer-generated graph of f (x) = x (sinx) would

be similar to that shown in [link], and it confirms our estimate.

table values.

At this point, we see from [link] and [link] that it may be just as easy, if not easier, to
estimate a limit of a function by inspecting its graph as it is to estimate the limit by
using a table of functional values. In [link], we evaluate a limit exclusively by looking
at a graph rather than by using a table of functional values.

Example:

   Problem:
   Evaluating a Limit Using a Graph

   For g (x) shown in [link], evaluate lim g (x).

                                                                                                                             x-1

                                    curve.

   Solution:
   Despite the fact that g (-1) = 4, as the x-values approach -1 from either side,
   the g (x) values approach 3. Therefore, lim g (x) = 3. Note that we can

   function.

Based on [link], we make the following observation: It is possible for the limit of a
function to exist at a point, and for the function to be defined at this point, but the limit
of the function and the value of the function at the point may be different.

Hint
What y-value does the function approach as the x-values approach 2?

Looking at a table of functional values or looking at the graph of a function provides us
with useful insight into the value of the limit of a function at a given point. However,
these techniques rely too much on guesswork. We eventually need to develop
alternative methods of evaluating limits. These new methods are more algebraic in
nature and we explore them in the next section; however, at this point we introduce two
special limits that are foundational to the techniques to come.

Note:
Two Important Limits
Let a be a real number and c be a constant.
    i. Equation:

                                                                                                lim x = a

                                                                                                                                       xa

   ii. Equation:

                                                                                                 lim c = c

                                                                                                                                        xa

We can make the following observations about these two limits.
   i. For the first limit, observe that as x approaches a, so does f (x), because
      f (x) = x. Consequently, limx = a.

                                                                                                       xa

  ii. For the second limit, consider [link].

x           f (x) = c                                                                                     x           f (x) = c

a - 0.1     c                                                                                             a + 0.1     c

a - 0.01    c                                                                                             a + 0.01    c

a - 0.001   c                                                                                             a + 0.001   c

a - 0.0001  c                                                                                             a + 0.0001  c

Table of Functional Values for limc = c

                                                                                                      xa

Observe that for all values of x (regardless of whether they are approaching a), the

values f (x) remain constant at c. We have no choice but to conclude limc = c.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      xa

The Existence of a Limit
As we consider the limit in the next example, keep in mind that for the limit of a
function to exist at a point, the functional values must approach a single real-number
value at that point. If the functional values do not approach a single value, then the
limit does not exist.

                                    x0

After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the y-values do
not seem to approach any one single value. It appears the limit does not exist.
Before drawing this conclusion, let's take a more systematic approach. Take the
following sequence of x-values approaching 0:
Equation:

22     2     2     2     2

,   ,     ,     ,     ,                                                                      ,....

 3 5 7 9 11

The corresponding y-values are
Equation:

                                                                   1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1,....

At this point we can indeed conclude that limsin (1/x) does not exist.

                                                                                                                                          x0

(Mathematicians frequently abbreviate "does not exist" as DNE. Thus, we would
write limsin (1/x) DNE.) The graph of f (x) = sin (1/x) is shown in [link]

                   x0

and it gives a clearer picture of the behavior of sin(1/x) as x approaches 0. You
can see that sin(1/x) oscillates ever more wildly between -1 and 1 as x

approaches 0.

The graph of f (x) = sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly
       between -1 and 1 as x approaches 0.

One-Sided Limits

Sometimes indicating that the limit of a function fails to exist at a point does not
provide us with enough information about the behavior of the function at that particular
point. To see this, we now revisit the function g (x) = |x - 2|/ (x - 2) introduced at
the beginning of the section (see [link](b)). As we pick values of x close to 2, g (x)
does not approach a single value, so the limit as x approaches 2 does not exist--that is,
limg (x) DNE. However, this statement alone does not give us a complete picture of

x2

the behavior of the function around the x-value 2. To provide a more accurate
description, we introduce the idea of a one-sided limit. For all values to the left of 2
(or the negative side of 2), g (x) = -1. Thus, as x approaches 2 from the left, g (x)
approaches -1. Mathematically, we say that the limit as x approaches 2 from the left is
-1. Symbolically, we express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                   lim g (x) = -1.

                                                                                                                   x2-

Similarly, as x approaches 2 from the right (or from the positive side), g (x) approaches
1. Symbolically, we express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                     lim g (x) = 1.

                                                                                                                       x2+
We can now present an informal definition of one-sided limits.

Note:
Definition
We define two types of one-sided limits.
Limit from the left: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of
the form (c, a), and let L be a real number. If the values of the function f (x) approach
the real number L as the values of x (where x < a) approach the number a, then we
say that L is the limit of f (x) as x approaches a from the left. Symbolically, we
express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                     lim f (x) = L.

                                                                                                                     xa-

Limit from the right: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval
of the form (a, c), and let L be a real number. If the values of the function f (x)
approach the real number L as the values of x (where x > a) approach the number a,
then we say that L is the limit of f (x) as x approaches a from the right. Symbolically,
we express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                     lim f (x) = L.

                                                                                                                     xa+

lim f (x) = 0. Therefore, the (two-sided) limit of f (x) does not exist at x = 2.

      (These tables are available from a previous Checkpoint problem.)

Let us now consider the relationship between the limit of a function at a point and the
limits from the right and left at that point. It seems clear that if the limit from the right
and the limit from the left have a common value, then that common value is the limit
of the function at that point. Similarly, if the limit from the left and the limit from the
right take on different values, the limit of the function does not exist. These
conclusions are summarized in [link].

Note:
Relating One-Sided and Two-Sided Limits

possible exception of a itself, and let L be a real number. Then,

Infinite Limits

Evaluating the limit of a function at a point or evaluating the limit of a function from
the right and left at a point helps us to characterize the behavior of a function around a
given value. As we shall see, we can also describe the behavior of functions that do not
have finite limits.

We now turn our attention to h (x) = 1/(x - 2) , 2 the third and final function
introduced at the beginning of this section (see [link](c)). From its graph we see that as
the values of x approach 2, the values of h (x) = 1/(x - 2)2 become larger and larger
and, in fact, become infinite. Mathematically, we say that the limit of h (x) as x
approaches 2 is positive infinity. Symbolically, we express this idea as
Equation:

                                                                                 lim h (x) = +.

                                                                                                                  x2

More generally, we define infinite limits as follows:

Note:
Definition
We define three types of infinite limits.
Infinite limits from the left: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open
interval of the form (b, a).

    i. If the values of f (x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x < a)
      approach the number a, then we say that the limit as x approaches a from the left
      is positive infinity and we write
      Equation:

                                                                                       lim f (x) = +.

                                                                                                                         xa-

   ii. If the values of f (x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x < a)
      approach the number a, then we say that the limit as x approaches a from the left
      is negative infinity and we write
      Equation:

                                                                                       lim f (x) = -.

                                                                                                                         xa-

Infinite limits from the right: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open
interval of the form (a, c).

    i. If the values of f (x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x > a)
      approach the number a, then we say that the limit as x approaches a from the
      right is positive infinity and we write
      Equation:

                                                                                       lim f (x) = +.

                                                                                                                         xa+
  ii. If the values of f (x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x > a)
      approach the number a, then we say that the limit as x approaches a from the
      right is negative infinity and we write
      Equation:

                                                                                      lim f (x) = -.

                                                                                                                       xa+

Two-sided infinite limit: Let f (x) be defined for all x  a in an open interval
containing a.

   i. If the values of f (x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x  a)
      approach the number a, then we say that the limit as x approaches a is positive
      infinity and we write
      Equation:

                                                                                      lim f (x) = +.

                                                                                                                         xa

  ii. If the values of f (x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x  a)
      approach the number a, then we say that the limit as x approaches a is negative
      infinity and we write
      Equation:

                                                                                      lim f (x) = -.

                                                                                                                         xa

It is important to understand that when we write statements such as limf (x) = +

                                                                                                                                                                                                                               xa

or limf (x) = - we are describing the behavior of the function, as we have just

        xa

defined it. We are not asserting that a limit exists. For the limit of a function f (x) to

exist at a, it must approach a real number L as x approaches a. That said, if, for

example, limf (x) = +, we always write limf (x) = + rather than limf (x)

a. The values of 1/x decrease without bound as x approaches 0 from the left.
  We conclude that
  Equation:

                                   1       = -.
                        lim
                       x0- x
b. The values of 1/x increase without bound as x approaches 0 from the right.
  We conclude that
  Equation:

                                          1  = +.
                               lim
                              x0+ x

c. Since lim- x = - 1 and lim+ x = + 1 have different values, we conclude
      x0   x0

that

Equation:

                              x0 x

The graph of f (x) = 1/x in [link] confirms these conclusions.

 The graph of f (x) = 1/x
confirms that the limit as x
approaches 0 does not exist.

Hint

Follow the procedures from [link].

It is useful to point out that functions of the form f (x) = 1/(x - a) , n where n is a
positive integer, have infinite limits as x approaches a from either the left or right
([link]). These limits are summarized in [link].
           The function f (x) = 1/(x - a)n has infinite limits at a.

Note:
Infinite Limits from Positive Integers
If n is a positive even integer, then
Equation:

                              1                = +.
           lim
           xa n (x - a)

If n is a positive odd integer, then

           lim                              n  = +

                                      +
           xa (x - a)

and
Equation:

                      xa (x - a)

We should also point out that in the graphs of f (x) = 1/(x - a) , n points on the graph
having x-coordinates very near to a are very close to the vertical line x = a. That is, as
x approaches a, the points on the graph of f (x) are closer to the line x = a. The line
x = a is called a vertical asymptote of the graph. We formally define a vertical
asymptote as follows:

Note:
Definition
Let f (x) be a function. If any of the following conditions hold, then the line x = a is
a vertical asymptote of f (x).

Chapter Opener: Einstein's Equation

           (credit: NASA)

In the chapter opener we mentioned briefly how Albert Einstein showed that a
limit exists to how fast any object can travel. Given Einstein's equation for the
mass of a moving object, what is the value of this bound?

Solution:

Our starting point is Einstein's equation for the mass of a moving object,
Equation:

                           m=        m0
                                                     ,

                                                        v2

                               1 -

                                                        c2

where m0 is the object's mass at rest, v is its speed, and c is the speed of light. To
see how the mass changes at high speeds, we can graph the ratio of masses
m/m0 as a function of the ratio of speeds, v/c ([link]).
      This graph shows the ratio of
   masses as a function of the ratio of
    speeds in Einstein's equation for

       the mass of a moving object.

We can see that as the ratio of speeds approaches 1--that is, as the speed of the
object approaches the speed of light--the ratio of masses increases without
bound. In other words, the function has a vertical asymptote at v/c = 1. We can
try a few values of this ratio to test this idea.

v       1 -     v2 m

c c2 m0

0.99    0.1411                                  7.089

0.999   0.0447                                  22.37

0.9999  0.0141                                  70.71

Ratio of Masses and Speeds for a Moving Object

Thus, according to [link], if an object with mass 100 kg is traveling at 0.9999c,
its mass becomes 7071 kg. Since no object can have an infinite mass, we
conclude that no object can travel at or more than the speed of light.

Key Concepts

      A table of values or graph may be used to estimate a limit.
      If the limit of a function at a point does not exist, it is still possible that the limits
      from the left and right at that point may exist.
      If the limits of a function from the left and right exist and are equal, then the limit
      of the function is that common value.
      We may use limits to describe infinite behavior of a function at a point.

Glossary

infinite limit
      A function has an infinite limit at a point a if it either increases or decreases
      without bound as it approaches a

intuitive definition of the limit
      If all values of the function f (x) approach the real number L as the values of
      x ( a) approach a, f (x) approaches L

one-sided limit
      A one-sided limit of a function is a limit taken from either the left or the right

vertical asymptote
      A function has a vertical asymptote at x = a if the limit as x approaches a from
      the right or left is infinite
The Limit Laws

      Recognize the basic limit laws.
      Use the limit laws to evaluate the limit of a function.
      Evaluate the limit of a function by factoring.
      Use the limit laws to evaluate the limit of a polynomial or rational function.
      Evaluate the limit of a function by factoring or by using conjugates.
      Evaluate the limit of a function by using the squeeze theorem.

In the previous section, we evaluated limits by looking at graphs or by constructing a table of values. In this
section, we establish laws for calculating limits and learn how to apply these laws. In the Student Project at
the end of this section, you have the opportunity to apply these limit laws to derive the formula for the area
of a circle by adapting a method devised by the Greek mathematician Archimedes. We begin by restating
two useful limit results from the previous section. These two results, together with the limit laws, serve as a
foundation for calculating many limits.

Evaluating Limits with the Limit Laws

The first two limit laws were stated in [link] and we repeat them here. These basic results, together with the
other limit laws, allow us to evaluate limits of many algebraic functions.

      b. lim 5

                        x2

   Solution:
a. The limit of x as x approaches a is a: limx = 2.

                                                                                                                                   x2

b. The limit of a constant is that constant: lim5 = 5.

We now take a look at the limit laws, the individual properties of limits. The proofs that these laws hold are
omitted here.

Note:

Limit Laws

Let f (x) and g (x) be defined for all x  a over some open interval containing a. Assume that L and M

are real numbers such that limf (x) = L and limg (x) = M. Let c be a constant. Then, each of the

following statements holds:

Sum law for limits: lim (f (x) + g (x)) = limf (x) + limg (x) = L + M

                         xa                                            xa           xa

Difference law for limits: lim (f (x) - g (x)) = limf (x) - limg (x) = L - M

                                                                                                                                                                                 xa

We now practice applying these limit laws to evaluate a limit.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Evaluating a Limit Using Limit Laws

   Use the limit laws to evaluate lim (4x + 2).

                                                                                                            x-3

   Solution:

   Let's apply the limit laws one step at a time to be sure we understand how they work. We need to keep
   in mind the requirement that, at each application of a limit law, the new limits must exist for the limit
   law to be applied.
 lim (4x + 2)  = lim 4x + lim 2                            Apply the sum law.
                                                           Apply the constant multiple law.
x-3               x-3                      x-3             Apply the basic limit results and simplif y.

               = 4  lim x + lim 2

                  x-3                          x-3

               = 4  (-3) + 2 = -10.

Example:

   Problem:
   Using Limit Laws Repeatedly

                                           x2

Solution:

To find this limit, we need to apply the limit laws several times. Again, we need to keep in mind that
as we rewrite the limit in terms of other limits, each new limit must exist for the limit law to be
applied.

Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions
By now you have probably noticed that, in each of the previous examples, it has been the case that
limf (x) = f (a). This is not always true, but it does hold for all polynomials for any choice of a and for

xa

all rational functions at all values of a for which the rational function is defined.

Note:
Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions
Let p (x) and q (x) be polynomial functions. Let a be a real number. Then,
Equation:

                                                         lim p (x) = p (a)

                                                         xa

Equation:

                                                p (x)         p (a)

                                          lim            =           when q (a)  0.

                                          xa q (x)            q (a)

To  see  that  this  theorem  holds,  consider  the      polynomial  p  (x)              =              n  +                     n-1  +    +  c1x  +  c0.  By

                                                                                            cnx               cn-1x

applying the sum, constant multiple, and power laws, we end up with

Equation:

                                                n             n-1
                     lim p (x)  = lim (cnx + cn-1x                   +  + c1x + c0)

                     xa               xa

                                                   n                    n-1

                                = cn(lim x)              + cn-1( lim x)                  +  + c1 (lim x) + lim c0

                                                     xa                              xa                       xa                         xa

                                      n                  n-1  +  + c1a + c0
                                = cna + cn-1a

                                = p (a).

It now follows from the quotient law that if p (x) and q (x) are polynomials for which q (a)  0, then
Equation:

                                                              p (x)     p (a)

                                                         lim         =                      .

                                                         xa q (x)       q (a)

Additional Limit Evaluation Techniques

As we have seen, we may evaluate easily the limits of polynomials and limits of some (but not all) rational
functions by direct substitution. However, as we saw in the introductory section on limits, it is certainly
possible for limf (x) to exist when f (a) is undefined. The following observation allows us to evaluate

                                        xa

many limits of this type:

If for all x  a, f (x) = g (x) over some open interval containing a, then limf (x) = limg (x).

                                                                                                                                                                               xa  xa

To understand this idea better, consider the limit lim x-1 . x2-1
                                                                                                                                                                 x1

The function
Equation:

              f (x)                                                            =  x2-1
                                                                                  x-1

                                                                               =  (x-1)(x+1)
                                                                                            x-1

and the function g (x) = x + 1 are identical for all values of x  1. The graphs of these two functions are
shown in [link].
             The graphs of f (x) and g (x) are identical for all x  1. Their limits at 1 are equal.

We see that
Equation:

                                               2               (x-1)(x+1)

                                    x -1          = lim        x-1

                      lim                                  x1

                      x1 x-1

                                                  = lim (x + 1)

                                                           x1

                                                  = 2.

The limit has the form lim , f(x) where limf (x) = 0 and limg (x) = 0. (In this case, we say that
             xa g(x)
                      xa                                       xa

f(x)/g(x) has the indeterminate form 0/0.) The following Problem-Solving Strategy provides a general

outline for evaluating limits of this type.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Calculating a Limit When f (x)/g (x) has the Indeterminate Form 0/0

   1. First, we need to make sure that our function has the appropriate form and cannot be evaluated
      immediately using the limit laws.

   2. We then need to find a function that is equal to h (x) = f(x)/g(x) for all x  a over some interval
      containing a. To do this, we may need to try one or more of the following steps:

         a. If f (x) and g (x) are polynomials, we should factor each function and cancel out any common
            factors.

         b. If the numerator or denominator contains a difference involving a square root, we should try
            multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the expression involving the
            square root.

         c. If f(x)/g(x) is a complex fraction, we begin by simplifying it.
3. Last, we apply the limit laws.

The next examples demonstrate the use of this Problem-Solving Strategy. [link] illustrates the factor-and-
cancel technique; [link] shows multiplying by a conjugate. In [link], we look at simplifying a complex
fraction.

   Evaluating a Limit by Factoring and Canceling

   Evaluate lim 2 . x2-3x
                                       x3 2x -5x-3

Solution:

Step 1. The function f (x) = 2x2-5x-3 x2-3x is undefined for x = 3. In fact, if we substitute 3 into the
function we get 0/0, which is undefined. Factoring and canceling is a good strategy:
Equation:

                                        2                                                                               x (x - 3)
                                                                                               = lim
                            x - 3x
                                                                                                     x3 (x - 3) (2x + 1)
           lim
           x3 2x2 - 5x - 3

Step 2. For all x  3, 2 = . x2-3x x Therefore,
           2x -5x-3                                                                 2x+1

   Problem:
   Evaluating a Limit by Multiplying by a Conjugate

Evaluate lim . x+2-1
                                                        x+1
                              x-1

Solution:

Step 1.    x+2-1      has the form 0/0 at -1. Let's begin by multiplying by x + 2 + 1, the conjugate of
                 x+1

x + 2 - 1, on the numerator and denominator:

Equation:

                                                             x + 2 - 1         x + 2 - 1 x + 2 + 1

                      lim                                               = lim                           .

                      x-1                                    x+1        x-1       x+1        x + 2 + 1

Step 2. We then multiply out the numerator. We don't multiply out the denominator because we are
hoping that the (x + 1) in the denominator cancels out in the end:
Equation:

                                                                                  x+1

                                                             = lim                             .

                                                             x-1

                                                                          (x + 1) (x + 2 + 1)

Step 3. Then we cancel:
Equation:

                                                                                  1

                                                                  = lim                .

                                                                        x-1 x + 2 + 1

Step 4. Last, we apply the limit laws:
Equation:

                                                                               1       1

                                                                  lim                  =.

                                                                  x-1 x + 2 + 1 2

Evaluate lim x+1 . - 2
             x1 x-1

Solution:

             1    -  1

Step 1.      x+1     2     has the form 0/0 at 1. We simplify the algebraic fraction by multiplying by

             x-1

2 (x + 1)/2 (x + 1) :

Equation:

                                       1    -  1               1    -  1

Step 2. Next, we multiply through the numerators. Do not multiply the denominators because we want
to be able to cancel the factor (x - 1):
Equation:

                                                   2 - (x + 1)

                                            = lim                           .

                                               x1 2 (x - 1) (x + 1)

Step 3. Then, we simplify the numerator:
Equation:

                                                               -x + 1

                                            = lim                           .

                                               x1 2 (x - 1) (x + 1)

Step 4. Now we factor out -1 from the numerator:
Equation:

                                                   - (x - 1)

                                            = lim                           .

                                               x1 2 (x - 1) (x + 1)
Step 5. Then, we cancel the common factors of (x - 1):
Equation:

                                                 -1

                         = lim                                                                                                               .

                         x1 2 (x + 1)

Step 6. Last, we evaluate using the limit laws:
Equation:

   Problem:
   Evaluating a Limit When the Limit Laws Do Not Apply

Evaluate lim ( + ). 1 5
x0 x  x(x-5)

Solution:

Both 1/x and 5/x (x - 5) fail to have a limit at zero. Since neither of the two functions has a limit at
zero, we cannot apply the sum law for limits; we must use a different strategy. In this case, we find the
limit by performing addition and then applying one of our previous strategies. Observe that
Equation:
                    1        +       5          =       x-5+5

Let's now revisit one-sided limits. Simple modifications in the limit laws allow us to apply them to one-

sided limits. For example, to apply the limit laws to a limit of the form lim h (x), we require the function

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          xa-

   Evaluating a One-Sided Limit Using the Limit Laws

   Evaluate each of the following limits, if possible.

      a. lim x - 3

                        x3-

      b. lim x - 3

                        x3+
Solution:
[link] illustrates the function f (x) = x - 3 and aids in our understanding of these limits.

   The graph shows the function

                    f (x) = x - 3.

a. The function f (x) = x - 3 is defined over the interval [3, +). Since this function is not
  defined to the left of 3, we cannot apply the limit laws to compute lim x - 3. In fact, since

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   x3-

  f (x) = x - 3 is undefined to the left of 3, lim x - 3 does not exist.

                                                                                                                                                               x3-

b. Since f (x) = x - 3 is defined to the right of 3, the limit laws do apply to lim x - 3. By

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      x3+

  applying these limit laws we obtain lim x - 3 = 0.

                                                                                                                               x3+

In [link] we look at one-sided limits of a piecewise-defined function and use these limits to draw a
conclusion about a two-sided limit of the same function.

This graph shows a function f (x).

a. Since f (x) = 4x - 3 for all x in (-, 2), replace f (x) in the limit with 4x - 3 and apply the

  the limit laws:

                             x2+          x2+

We now turn our attention to evaluating a limit of the form lim g(x) , where limf (x) = K, where K  0
                                                                    xa            xa

Evaluate lim 2 x-3 .
                              x2- x -2x

Solution:

Step 1. After substituting in x = 2, we see that this limit has the form -1/0. That is, as x approaches

2 from the left, the numerator approaches -1; and the denominator approaches 0. Consequently, the

magnitude of      x-3                    becomes infinite. To get a better idea of what the limit is, we need to factor the
              x(x-2)

denominator:

Equation:

                                                        x-3         x-3

                                          lim                = lim             .
                                         x2- x2 - 2x
                                                             x2- x (x - 2)

Step 2. Since x - 2 is the only part of the denominator that is zero when 2 is substituted, we then
separate 1/(x - 2) from the rest of the function:
Equation:

                                                        x-3                   1

                                                        = lim                      .
                                                              x2- x
                                                                              x-2

Step 3. lim x-3 = - 1             and lim 1             = -. Therefore, the product of (x - 3)/x and 1/(x - 2)
                         x2- x 2               x2- x-2

The Squeeze Theorem

The techniques we have developed thus far work very well for algebraic functions, but we are still unable to
evaluate limits of very basic trigonometric functions. The next theorem, called the squeeze theorem, proves
very useful for establishing basic trigonometric limits. This theorem allows us to calculate limits by
"squeezing" a function, with a limit at a point a that is unknown, between two functions having a common
known limit at a. [link] illustrates this idea.
The Squeeze Theorem applies when

f (x)  g (x)  h (x) and lim f (x) = lim h (x).

Because -1  cos x  1 for all x, we have -|x|  x cos x  |x|. Since lim (-|x|) = 0 = lim|x|,

squeezed between them.

We now use the squeeze theorem to tackle several very important limits. Although this discussion is
somewhat lengthy, these limits prove invaluable for the development of the material in both the next section
and the next chapter. The first of these limits is limsin . Consider the unit circle shown in [link]. In the

                                                                                                                                                             0

figure, we see that sin  is the y-coordinate on the unit circle and it corresponds to the line segment shown in
blue. The radian measure of angle  is the length of the arc it subtends on the unit circle. Therefore, we see
that for 0 <  < , 0 < sin  < . 

                                                           2
    The sine function is shown as a line on the unit circle.

Because lim 0 = 0 and lim  = 0, by using the squeeze theorem we conclude that

         0+                    0+

Equation:

                                                        lim sin  = 0.

                                                       0+

To see that lim-sin  = 0 as well, observe that for - 2 <  < 0, 0 < - < 2   and hence,
                                     0

0 < sin (-) < -. Consequently, 0 < -sin  < -. It follows that 0 > sin  > . An application of the

squeeze theorem produces the desired limit. Thus, since lim sin  = 0 and lim sin  = 0,

                                                                  0+               0-

Equation:

                                                       lim sin  = 0.

                                                       0

Next, using the identity cos  = 1 - sin  2 for - 2 <  < 2 ,   we see that
Equation:

                                            lim cos  = lim1 - sin2 = 1.

                                            0          0

We  now  take  a  look  at  a  limit  that  plays  an  important  role  in  later  chapters--namely,  lim  sin    .  To  evaluate
                                                                                                              
                                                                                                      0

this limit, we use the unit circle in [link]. Notice that this figure adds one additional triangle to [link]. We

see that the length of the side opposite angle  in this new triangle is tan . Thus, we see that for

                                 

0 <  < , sin  <  < tan .

                                 2
The sine and tangent functions are shown as lines on
                       the unit circle.

By dividing by sin  in all parts of the inequality, we obtain
Equation:

Equivalently, we have

                                   1>                                                                                                                sin   > cos .
                                                                                                                                                        

Since lim 1 = 1 = lim cos , we conclude that lim  = 1. sin By applying a manipulation similar to that

used in demonstrating that  lim sin  = 0, we can show that                                                                                                    lim      sin   = 1.

Note:
Deriving the Formula for the Area of a Circle
Some of the geometric formulas we take for granted today were first derived by methods that anticipate
some of the methods of calculus. The Greek mathematician Archimedes (ca. 287-212; BCE) was
particularly inventive, using polygons inscribed within circles to approximate the area of the circle as the
number of sides of the polygon increased. He never came up with the idea of a limit, but we can use this
idea to see what his geometric constructions could have predicted about the limit.
We can estimate the area of a circle by computing the area of an inscribed regular polygon. Think of the
regular polygon as being made up of n triangles. By taking the limit as the vertex angle of these triangles
goes to zero, you can obtain the area of the circle. To see this, carry out the following steps:

   1. Express the height h and the base b of the isosceles triangle in [link] in terms of  and r.

2. Using the expressions that you obtained in step 1, express the area of the isosceles triangle in terms of

 and r.

(Substitute (1 / 2) sin  for sin( / 2) cos( / 2) in your expression.)

3. If an n-sided regular polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius r, find a relationship between  and n.

Solve this for n. Keep in mind there are 2 radians in a circle. (Use radians, not degrees.)

4. Find an expression for the area of the n-sided polygon in terms of r and .

5. To find a formula for the area of the circle, find the limit of the expression in step 4 as  goes to zero.

(Hint: lim  (sin )

                    = 1).

The technique of estimating areas of regions by using polygons is revisited in Introduction to Integration.

Key Concepts

      The limit laws allow us to evaluate limits of functions without having to go through step-by-step
      processes each time.
      For polynomials and rational functions, limf (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                                                                    xa

      You can evaluate the limit of a function by factoring and canceling, by multiplying by a conjugate, or
      by simplifying a complex fraction.
      The squeeze theorem allows you to find the limit of a function if the function is always greater than
      one function and less than another function with limits that are known.

Continuity
      Explain the three conditions for continuity at a point.
      Describe three kinds of discontinuities.
      Define continuity on an interval.
      State the theorem for limits of composite functions.
      Provide an example of the intermediate value theorem.

Many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the
page. Such functions are called continuous. Other functions have points at which a break in the graph occurs, but
satisfy this property over intervals contained in their domains. They are continuous on these intervals and are said
to have a discontinuity at a point where a break occurs.
We begin our investigation of continuity by exploring what it means for a function to have continuity at a point.
Intuitively, a function is continuous at a particular point if there is no break in its graph at that point.

Continuity at a Point

Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let's consider
various functions that fail to meet our intuitive notion of what it means to be continuous at a point. We then create
a list of conditions that prevent such failures.
Our first function of interest is shown in [link]. We see that the graph of f (x) has a hole at a. In fact, f (a) is
undefined. At the very least, for f (x) to be continuous at a, we need the following condition:
Equation:

                                                                                                                i. f (a) is def ined.

         The function f (x) is not
     continuous at a because f (a) is

                  undefined.

However, as we see in [link], this condition alone is insufficient to guarantee continuity at the point a. Although
f (a) is defined, the function has a gap at a. In this example, the gap exists because limf (x) does not exist. We

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    xa

must add another condition for continuity at a--namely,
Equation:

                                                                                                                ii. lim f (x) exists.

                                                                                                                                                                       xa
         The function f (x) is not
    continuous at a because limf (x)

                                                                                            xa

               does not exist.

However, as we see in [link], these two conditions by themselves do not guarantee continuity at a point. The
function in this figure satisfies both of our first two conditions, but is still not continuous at a. We must add a third
condition to our list:
Equation:

                                                                                                            iii. lim f (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                                                                                    xa

         The function f (x) is not
          continuous at a because

                         lim f (x)  f (a).

                                    xa

Now we put our list of conditions together and form a definition of continuity at a point.
Note:
Definition
A function f (x) is continuous at a point a if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:

   i. f (a) is defined
  ii. limf (x) exists

                xa

  iii. limf (x) = f (a)

                xa

A function is discontinuous at a point a if it fails to be continuous at a.

The following procedure can be used to analyze the continuity of a function at a point using this definition.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Determining Continuity at a Point

1. Check to see if f (a) is defined. If f (a) is undefined, we need go no further. The function is not continuous

at a. If f (a) is defined, continue to step 2.

2. Compute limf (x). In some cases, we may need to do this by first computing lim f (x) and lim f (x). If

xa                                                                        xa -  xa +

limf (x) does not exist (that is, it is not a real number), then the function is not continuous at a and the

xa

problem is solved. If limf (x) exists, then continue to step 3.

                                                                      xa

3. Compare f (a) and limf (x). If limf (x)  f (a), then the function is not continuous at a. If

    xa  xa

limf (x) = f (a), then the function is continuous at a.

The next three examples demonstrate how to apply this definition to determine whether a function is continuous at
a given point. These examples illustrate situations in which each of the conditions for continuity in the definition
succeed or fail.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Determining Continuity at a Point, Condition 1

   Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) = (x2 - 4)/(x - 2) is continuous at x = 2.
   Justify the conclusion.

   Solution:

   Let's begin by trying to calculate f (2). We can see that f (2) = 0/0, which is undefined. Therefore,
   f (x) = x-2 x2-4 is discontinuous at 2 because f (2) is undefined. The graph of f (x) is shown in [link].
The function f(x) is discontinuous at 2 because f (2)

                                                                                                                                                     -x + 4                                                                                  is continuous at x = 3.

Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) = {                                                                                                                                                                    if x > 3

                                                                                                                                                     4x - 8

Justify the conclusion.

Solution:

Let's begin by trying to calculate f (3).
Equation:

                                                                                      2

                                           f (3) = -(3 ) + 4 = -5.

Thus, f (3) is defined. Next, we calculate limf (x). To do this, we must compute lim f (x) and lim f (x):

                                           x3                                                                                                                                                                                     x3-  x3+

Equation:

                                                                       2

            lim f (x) = -(3 ) + 4 = -5

           x3-

and
Equation:

                                            lim f (x) = 4 (3) - 8 = 4.

                                           x3+
   Therefore, limf (x) does not exist. Thus, f (x) is not continuous at 3. The graph of f (x) is shown in [link].

                                            x3

         The function f (x) is not continuous at 3 because
                         limf (x) does not exist.

                                                                    x3

   Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) = { x if x  0 is continuous at x = 0.

                                                                                                                                                                   1 if x = 0

   Solution:
   First, observe that
   Equation:

                                                                                                                         f (0) = 1.

   Next,
   Equation:
                             lim f (x) = lim                                                                                                                                                  sinx= 1.

                             x0  x0 x

  Last, compare f (0) and limf (x). We see that

                                                                                   x1

  Equation:

                                                                        f (0) = 1 = limf (x).

                                                                                                                                                                                            x0

  Since all three of the conditions in the definition of continuity are satisfied, f (x) is continuous at x = 0.

Hint

Check each condition of the definition.

By applying the definition of continuity and previously established theorems concerning the evaluation of limits,
we can state the following theorem.

Note:
Continuity of Polynomials and Rational Functions
Polynomials and rational functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

Proof

Previously, we showed that if p (x) and q (x) are polynomials, limp (x) = p (a) for every polynomial p (x) and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                xa

    p(x)               p(a)  as long as q (a)  0. Therefore, polynomials and rational functions are continuous on their

Types of Discontinuities

As we have seen in [link] and [link], discontinuities take on several different appearances. We classify the types of
discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump discontinuities.
Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump
discontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite
discontinuity is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. [link] illustrates the differences in these types of
discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities,
keep in mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories.

           Discontinuities are classified as (a) removable, (b) jump, or (c) infinite.
These three discontinuities are formally defined as follows:

Note:
Definition
If f (x) is discontinuous at a, then

1. f has a removable discontinuity at a if limf (x) exists. (Note: When we state that limf (x) exists, we

                                           xa                                                                                                                                          xa

mean that limf (x) = L, where L is a real number.)

                                  xa

2. f has a jump discontinuity at a if lim f (x) and lim f (x) both exist, but lim f (x)  lim f (x). (Note:

                                      xa-        xa+                                                                                                                              xa-      xa+

When we state that lim f (x) and lim f (x) both exist, we mean that both are real-valued and that neither

           xa-                        xa+

take on the values ±.)

3. f has an infinite discontinuity at a if lim f (x) = ± or lim f (x) = ±.

                                      xa-                                                                                                                                    xa+

   Problem:
   Classifying a Discontinuity

   In [link], we showed that f (x) = x-2 x2-4 is discontinuous at x = 2. Classify this discontinuity as removable,
   jump, or infinite.

Solution:

To classify the discontinuity at 2 we must evaluate limf (x):

                                                                                                                                                                         x2

Equation:

                                      lim f (x)                         x2 -4

                                      x2         = lim

                                                          x2 x-2

                                                              (x-2)(x+2)

                                                 = lim                                                                                                                       x-2

                                                          x2

                                                 = lim (x + 2)

                                                          x2

                                                 = 4.

Since f is discontinuous at 2 and limf (x) exists, f has a removable discontinuity at x = 2.

                                                                                                            x2

In [link], we showed that f (x) = {                                                                       is discontinuous at x = 3. Classify this

discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite.

Solution:

Earlier, we showed that f is discontinuous at 3 because limf (x) does not exist. However, since

                                                                                                                                                                                      x3

lim f (x) = -5 and lim f (x) = 4 both exist, we conclude that the function has a jump discontinuity at 3.

   Classifying a Discontinuity

discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite.

Solution:

The function value f (-1) is undefined. Therefore, the function is not continuous at -1. To determine the

type of discontinuity, we must determine the limit at -1. We see that lim - x+1 = - x+2 and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   x-1

lim                        x+2  = +. Therefore, the function has an infinite discontinuity at -1.

determine the type of discontinuity.

Continuity over an Interval

Now that we have explored the concept of continuity at a point, we extend that idea to continuity over an
interval. As we develop this idea for different types of intervals, it may be useful to keep in mind the intuitive idea
that a function is continuous over an interval if we can use a pencil to trace the function between any two points in
the interval without lifting the pencil from the paper. In preparation for defining continuity on an interval, we begin
by looking at the definition of what it means for a function to be continuous from the right at a point and
continuous from the left at a point.

Note:

Continuity from the Right and from the Left

A function f (x) is said to be continuous from the right at a if lim f (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    xa+

A function f (x) is said to be continuous from the left at a if lim f (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                                                                                                                              xa-

A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. A function f (x) is
continuous over a closed interval of the form [a, b] if it is continuous at every point in (a, b) and is continuous
from the right at a and is continuous from the left at b. Analogously, a function f (x) is continuous over an interval
of the form (a, b] if it is continuous over (a, b) and is continuous from the left at b. Continuity over other types of
intervals are defined in a similar fashion.

Requiring that lim f (x) = f (a) and lim f (x) = f (b) ensures that we can trace the graph of the function from

                           xa+     xb-

the point (a, f (a)) to the point (b, f (b)) without lifting the pencil. If, for example, lim f (x)  f (a), we would

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     xa+

need to lift our pencil to jump from f (a) to the graph of the rest of the function over (a, b].

                                                       x2 +2x

Solution:

Since f (x) =                 x-1  is a rational function, it is continuous at every point in its domain. The domain of f (x)
                           x2 +2x

is the set (-, -2)  (-2, 0)  (0, +). Thus, f (x) is continuous over each of the intervals

(-, -2), (-2, 0), and (0, +).

Solution:

From the limit laws, we know that lim4 - x2 = 4 - a2 for all values of a in (-2, 2). We also know

                                                                                                                   xa

that lim 4 - x2 = 0 exists and lim 4 - x2 = 0 exists. Therefore, f (x) is continuous over the

                        +          x2-

Use [link] as a guide for solving.

The [link] allows us to expand our ability to compute limits. In particular, this theorem ultimately allows us to
demonstrate that trigonometric functions are continuous over their domains.

Note:
Composite Function Theorem
If f (x) is continuous at L and limg (x) = L, then

Before we move on to [link], recall that earlier, in the section on limit laws, we showed limcos x = 1 = cos (0).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  x0

Consequently, we know that f (x) = cos x is continuous at 0. In [link] we see how to combine this result with the

composite function theorem.

The proof of the next theorem uses the composite function theorem as well as the continuity of f (x) = sin x and
g (x) = cos x at the point 0 to show that trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains.

Note:
Continuity of Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains.

Proof

We begin by demonstrating that cos x is continuous at every real number. To do this, we must show that
limcos x = cos a for all values of a.

xa

lim cos x  = lim cos ((x - a) + a)                                           rewrite x = x - a + a

xa                  xa                                                       apply the identity f or the cosine of the

           = lim (cos (x - a) cos a - sin (x - a) sin a)                     lim (x - a) = 0, and sin x and cos x are

                    xa                                                       xa

           = cos (lim (x - a)) cos a - sin (lim (x - a)) sin a               evaluate cos(0) and sin(0) and simplif y

           xa                               xa

           = cos (0) cos a - sin (0) sin a

           = 1  cos a - 0  sin a = cos a.

The proof that sin x is continuous at every real number is analogous. Because the remaining trigonometric
functions may be expressed in terms of sin x and cos x, their continuity follows from the quotient limit law.



As you can see, the composite function theorem is invaluable in demonstrating the continuity of trigonometric
functions. As we continue our study of calculus, we revisit this theorem many times.

The Intermediate Value Theorem

Functions that are continuous over intervals of the form [a, b], where a and b are real numbers, exhibit many useful
properties. Throughout our study of calculus, we will encounter many powerful theorems concerning such
functions. The first of these theorems is the Intermediate Value Theorem.
Note:
The Intermediate Value Theorem
Let f be continuous over a closed, bounded interval [a, b]. If z is any real number between f (a) and f (b), then
there is a number c in [a, b] satisfying f (c) = z in [link].

There is a number c  [a, b] that satisfies

                                   f (c) = z.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Application of the Intermediate Value Theorem

   Show that f (x) = x - cos x has at least one zero.

   Solution:

   Since f (x) = x - cos x is continuous over (-, +), it is continuous over any closed interval of the
   form [a, b]. If you can find an interval [a, b] such that f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, you can use the
   Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude there must be a real number c in (a, b) that satisfies f (c) = 0. Note
   that
   Equation:

                                                                                                f (0) = 0 - cos (0) = -1 < 0

and
Equation:

                                                               

           f( ) =                                 - cos     =     > 0.

           2                                   2         2     2

Using the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can see that there must be a real number c in [0, /2] that
satisfies f (c) = 0. Therefore, f (x) = x - cos x has at least one zero.
Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?

   If f (x) is continuous over [0, 2], f (0) > 0 and f (2) > 0, can we use the Intermediate Value Theorem to
   conclude that f (x) has no zeros in the interval [0, 2]? Explain.

   Solution:

   No. The Intermediate Value Theorem only allows us to conclude that we can find a value between f (0) and
   f (2); it doesn't allow us to conclude that we can't find other values. To see this more clearly, consider the
   function f (x) = (x - 1) . 2 It satisfies f (0) = 1 > 0, f (2) = 1 > 0, and f (1) = 0.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?

   For f (x) = 1/x, f (-1) = -1 < 0 and f (1) = 1 > 0. Can we conclude that f (x) has a zero in the
   interval [-1, 1]?

   Solution:

   No. The function is not continuous over [-1, 1]. The Intermediate Value Theorem does not apply here.

Note:
Exercise:

Problem:   Show  that  f  (x)  =       3  -       2  -  3x  +  1  has  a  zero  over  the  interval  [0,  1].

                                  x          x

   Solution:
   f (0) = 1 > 0, f (1) = -2 < 0; f (x) is continuous over [0, 1]. It must have a zero on this interval.
Hint
Find f (0) and f (1). Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem.

Key Concepts

For a function to be continuous at a point, it must be defined at that point, its limit must exist at the point, and
the value of the function at that point must equal the value of the limit at that point.
Discontinuities may be classified as removable, jump, or infinite.
A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. It is continuous
over a closed interval if it is continuous at every point in its interior and is continuous at its endpoints.
The composite function theorem states: If f (x) is continuous at L and limg (x) = L, then

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          xa

lim f (g (x)) = f (lim g (x)) = f (L).

xa                     xa
      The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that if a function is continuous over a closed interval, then the
      function takes on every value between the values at its endpoints.

Exercise:

Problem:

A particle moving along a line has at each time t a position function s (t), which is continuous. Assume
s (2) = 5 and s (5) = 2. Another particle moves such that its position is given by h (t) = s (t) - t. Explain
why there must be a value c for 2 < c < 5 such that h (c) = 0.

   Solution:

   Since both s and y = t are continuous everywhere, then h (t) = s (t) - t is continuous everywhere and, in
   particular, it is continuous over the closed interval [2, 5]. Also, h (2) = 3 > 0 and h (5) = -3 < 0.

Now that we have both a conceptual understanding of a limit and the practical ability to compute
limits, we have established the foundation for our study of calculus, the branch of mathematics in
which we compute derivatives and integrals. Most mathematicians and historians agree that calculus
was developed independently by the Englishman Isaac Newton (1643-1727) and the German
Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), whose images appear in [link]. When we credit Newton and Leibniz
with developing calculus, we are really referring to the fact that Newton and Leibniz were the first to
understand the relationship between the derivative and the integral. Both mathematicians benefited
from the work of predecessors, such as Barrow, Fermat, and Cavalieri. The initial relationship
between the two mathematicians appears to have been amicable; however, in later years a bitter
controversy erupted over whose work took precedence. Although it seems likely that Newton did,
indeed, arrive at the ideas behind calculus first, we are indebted to Leibniz for the notation that we
commonly use today.

                Newton and Leibniz are credited with developing calculus independently.
Tangent Lines

We begin our study of calculus by revisiting the notion of secant lines and tangent lines. Recall that
we used the slope of a secant line to a function at a point (a, f (a)) to estimate the rate of change, or
the rate at which one variable changes in relation to another variable. We can obtain the slope of the
secant by choosing a value of x near a and drawing a line through the points (a, f (a)) and
(x, f (x)), as shown in [link]. The slope of this line is given by an equation in the form of a
difference quotient:
Equation:

                       msec =               f (x) - f (a)
                                                                             .

                                                     x-a

We can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value a by using this equation and
replacing x with a + h, where h is a value close to 0. We can then calculate the slope of the line
through the points (a, f (a)) and (a + h, f (a + h)). In this case, we find the secant line has a slope
given by the following difference quotient with increment h:
Equation:

                       f (a + h) - f (a)                  f (a + h) - f (a)

               msec =                                =                                                  .
                                                                                h
                       a+h-a

Note:
Definition
Let f be a function defined on an interval I containing a. If x  a is in I, then
Equation:

                       Q=                   f (x) - f (a)
                                                    x-a

is a difference quotient.
Also, if h  0 is chosen so that a + h is in I, then
Equation:

                       Q=                   f (a + h) - f (a)
                                                               h

is a difference quotient with increment h.

Note:
View the development of the derivative with this applet.
These two expressions for calculating the slope of a secant line are illustrated in [link]. We will see
that each of these two methods for finding the slope of a secant line is of value. Depending on the
setting, we can choose one or the other. The primary consideration in our choice usually depends on
ease of calculation.

                      We can calculate the slope of a secant line in either of two ways.
In [link](a) we see that, as the values of x approach a, the slopes of the secant lines provide better
estimates of the rate of change of the function at a. Furthermore, the secant lines themselves
approach the tangent line to the function at a, which represents the limit of the secant lines. Similarly,
[link](b) shows that as the values of h get closer to 0, the secant lines also approach the tangent line.
The slope of the tangent line at a is the rate of change of the function at a, as shown in [link](c).
    The secant lines approach the tangent line (shown in green) as the second point approaches the
                                                          first.

Note:
You can use this site to explore graphs to see if they have a tangent line at a point.

In [link] we show the graph of f (x) = x and its tangent line at (1, 1) in a series of tighter intervals
about x = 1. As the intervals become narrower, the graph of the function and its tangent line appear
to coincide, making the values on the tangent line a good approximation to the values of the function
for choices of x close to 1. In fact, the graph of f(x) itself appears to be locally linear in the
immediate vicinity of x = 1.
For values of x close to 1, the graph of f (x) = x and its tangent line appear to coincide.

Formally we may define the tangent line to the graph of a function as follows.

Note:
Definition
Let f(x) be a function defined in an open interval containing a. The tangent line to f(x) at a is the
line passing through the point (a, f (a)) having slope
Equation:

                                                            f (x) - f (a)

                             mtan = lim                     x-a

                                                        xa

provided this limit exists.
Equivalently, we may define the tangent line to f (x) at a to be the line passing through the point
(a, f (a)) having slope
Equation:

                                                                  f (a + h) - f (a)

                                                mtan = lim

                                                             h0              h

provided this limit exists.

Just as we have used two different expressions to define the slope of a secant line, we use two
different forms to define the slope of the tangent line. In this text we use both forms of the definition.
As before, the choice of definition will depend on the setting. Now that we have formally defined a
tangent line to a function at a point, we can use this definition to find equations of tangent lines.

Next, find a point on the tangent line. Since the line is tangent to the graph of f(x) at x = 3, it
passes through the point (3, f (3)). We have f (3) = 9, so the tangent line passes through the
point (3, 9).

Using the point-slope equation of the line with the slope m = 6 and the point (3, 9), we obtain

the  line  y  -  9  =  6           (x  -  3).   Simplifying,  we  have   y   =  6x   -  9.     The    graph  of  f  (x)  =      2  and  its

The Derivative of a Function at a Point

The type of limit we compute in order to find the slope of the line tangent to a function at a point
occurs in many applications across many disciplines. These applications include velocity and
acceleration in physics, marginal profit functions in business, and growth rates in biology. This limit
occurs so frequently that we give this value a special name: the derivative. The process of finding a
derivative is called differentiation.

Note:
Definition
Let f(x) be a function defined in an open interval containing a. The derivative of the function f(x)
at a, denoted by f  (a), is defined by
Equation:

                                                                          f (x) - f (a)

provided this limit exists.
Alternatively, we may also define the derivative of f(x) at a as
Equation:

                                          f (a) = lim                                    .

Velocities and Rates of Change

Now that we can evaluate a derivative, we can use it in velocity applications. Recall that if s (t) is
the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis, the average velocity of the object over a
time interval [a, t] if t > a or [t, a] if t < a is given by the difference quotient
Equation:

                                vave =  s (t) - s(a)
                                                                      .

                                                t-a

As the values of t approach a, the values of vave approach the value we call the instantaneous
velocity at a. That is, instantaneous velocity at a, denoted v (a), is given by
Equation:

                                            s (t) - s(a)

v (a) = s (a) = lim                                                      .

                                        ta  t-a

To better understand the relationship between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, see [link].
In this figure, the slope of the tangent line (shown in red) is the instantaneous velocity of the object at
time t = a whose position at time t is given by the function s (t). The slope of the secant line
(shown in green) is the average velocity of the object over the time interval [a, t].
   The slope of the secant line is the average velocity over
    the interval [a, t]. The slope of the tangent line is the
                       instantaneous velocity.

We can use [link] to calculate the instantaneous velocity, or we can estimate the velocity of a moving
object by using a table of values. We can then confirm the estimate by using [link].

   Solution:
We can estimate the instantaneous velocity at t = 0 by computing a table of average velocities
using values of t approaching 0, as shown in [link].

0.1                               0.998334166

Average velocities using values of t approaching 0

From the table we see that the average velocity over the time interval [-0.1, 0] is
0.998334166, the average velocity over the time interval [-0.01, 0] is 0.9999833333, and so
forth. Using this table of values, it appears that a good estimate is v (0) = 1.

By using [link], we can see that
Equation:

                                                          sin t - sin 0                  sin t  = 1.
                                                                         = lim
                                       
                                                                               t0 t
        v (0) = s (0) = lim

                                  t0  t-0

Thus, in fact, v (0) = 1.

As we have seen throughout this section, the slope of a tangent line to a function and instantaneous
velocity are related concepts. Each is calculated by computing a derivative and each measures the
instantaneous rate of change of a function, or the rate of change of a function at any point along the
function.

Note:
Definition
The instantaneous rate of change of a function f(x) at a value a is its derivative f (a).

   Chapter Opener: Estimating Rate of Change of Velocity

        (credit: modification of work by
                 Codex41, Flickr)

   Reaching a top speed of 270.49 mph, the Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the
   world. In tests it went from 0 to 60 mph in 3.05 seconds, from 0 to 100 mph in 5.88 seconds,
   from 0 to 200 mph in 14.51 seconds, and from 0 to 229.9 mph in 19.96 seconds. Use this data
   to draw a conclusion about the rate of change of velocity (that is, its acceleration) as it
   approaches 229.9 mph. Does the rate at which the car is accelerating appear to be increasing,
   decreasing, or constant?

   Solution:
First observe that 60 mph = 88 ft/s, 100 mph  146.67 ft/s, 200 mph  293.33 ft/s, and 229.9
mph  337.19 ft/s. We can summarize the information in a table.

v (t) at different values of t

Now compute the average acceleration of the car in feet per second per second on intervals of
the form [t, 19.96] as t approaches 19.96, as shown in the following table.

           v(t)-v(19.96)  v(t)-337.19

Average acceleration

The rate at which the car is accelerating is decreasing as its velocity approaches 229.9 mph
(337.19 ft/s).

Rate of Change of Temperature

A homeowner sets the thermostat so that the temperature in the house begins to drop from
70°F at 9 p.m., reaches a low of 60° during the night, and rises back to 70° by 7 a.m. the next
morning. Suppose that the temperature in the house is given by T (t) = 0.4t2 - 4t + 70 for
0  t  10, where t is the number of hours past 9 p.m. Find the instantaneous rate of change
of the temperature at midnight.

Since  midnight  is  3  hours  past  9    p.m.,     we  want  to  compute  T         Refer  to  [link].

   Rate of Change of Profit

   A toy company can sell x electronic gaming systems at a price of p = -0.01x + 400 dollars
   per gaming system. The cost of manufacturing x systems is given by C (x) = 100x + 10,000
   dollars. Find the rate of change of profit when 10,000 games are produced. Should the toy
   company increase or decrease production?

   Solution:

   The profit P (x) earned by producing x gaming systems is R (x) - C (x), where R (x) is the
   revenue obtained from the sale of x games. Since the company can sell x games at
   p = -0.01x + 400 per game,
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2

                                                   R (x) = xp = x (-0.01x + 400) = -0.01x + 400x.
Consequently,
Equation:

                                                                                                        2

                                               P (x) = -0.01x + 300x - 10,000.

Therefore, evaluating the rate of change of profit gives
Equation:

                                                                         P (x)-P (10000)

                         P (10000)                      = lim            x-10000

                                                                 x10000

                                                        =      lim       -0.01x2+300x-10000-1990000
                                                                                                       x-10000
                                                           x10000

                                                        =      lim       -0.01x2+300x-2000000
                                                                                             x-10000
                                                           x10000

                                                        = 100.

Since the rate of change of profit P  (10,000) > 0 and P (10,000) > 0, the company should
increase production.

Key Concepts

      The slope of the tangent line to a curve measures the instantaneous rate of change of a curve.
      We can calculate it by finding the limit of the difference quotient or the difference quotient with
      increment h.
      The derivative of a function f (x) at a value a is found using either of the definitions for the
      slope of the tangent line.
Velocity is the rate of change of position. As such, the velocity v (t) at time t is the derivative of
the position s (t) at time t. Average velocity is given by
Equation:

The Derivative as a Function

      Define the derivative function of a given function.
      Graph a derivative function from the graph of a given function.
      State the connection between derivatives and continuity.
      Describe three conditions for when a function does not have a derivative.
      Explain the meaning of a higher-order derivative.

As we have seen, the derivative of a function at a given point gives us the rate of change or slope of the tangent
line to the function at that point. If we differentiate a position function at a given time, we obtain the velocity at
that time. It seems reasonable to conclude that knowing the derivative of the function at every point would
produce valuable information about the behavior of the function. However, the process of finding the derivative
at even a handful of values using the techniques of the preceding section would quickly become quite tedious.
In this section we define the derivative function and learn a process for finding it.

Derivative Functions

The derivative function gives the derivative of a function at each point in the domain of the original function
for which the derivative is defined. We can formally define a derivative function as follows.

Note:

Definition

Let  f  be  a  function.  The  derivative  function,  denoted  by  f      is  the  function  whose  domain  consists  of  those

                                                                       ,

values of x such that the following limit exists:

Equation:

                                                          f (x + h) - f (x)

                                           f (x) = lim                             .

                                                      h0                  h

A function f(x) is said to be differentiable at a if f (a) exists. More generally, a function is said to be
differentiable on S if it is differentiable at every point in an open set S, and a differentiable function is one in
which f (x) exists on its domain.

In the next few examples we use [link] to find the derivative of a function.

Use [link] and follow the example.f (x) = x2 - 2x, then f  (x) = 2x - 2. If we had expressed this function in the form y = x2 - 2x, we could

have expressed the derivative as y = 2x - 2 or dx = 2x - 2. dy We could have conveyed the same information

by writing   d  (x2  -  2x)  =  2x  -  2.  Thus,  for  the  function          y  =  f  (x),    each  of  the  following  notations
            dx

represents the derivative of f (x):

                                                       dx

In place of f  (a) we may also use dx dy                                                dy

                                                  Use of the dx notation (called Leibniz notation) is quite common in

                                           x=a

engineering and physics. To understand this notation better, recall that the derivative of a function at a point is

the limit of the slopes of secant lines as the secant lines approach the tangent line. The slopes of these secant

                                                                                                                            y

lines are often expressed in the form x where y is the difference in the y values corresponding to the

difference in the x values, which are expressed as x ([link]). Thus the derivative, which can be thought of as

the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x, is expressed as

Equation:

                                                       dy                     y

Graphing a Derivative

We have already discussed how to graph a function, so given the equation of a function or the equation of a

derivative function, we could graph it. Given both, we would expect to see a correspondence between the

graphs  of  these  two  functions,       since  f        gives  the      rate  of  change     of  a  function  f   (x)  (or  slope  of  the  tangent

                                                    (x)

line to f(x) ).

In  [link]  we  found  that  for  f   (x)  =  x,   f           =  1/2x.           If  we  graph    these  functions     on   the  same  axes,  as  in

                                                          (x)

[link], we can use the graphs to understand the relationship between these two functions. First, we notice that

f(x) is increasing over its entire domain, which means that the slopes of its tangent lines at all points are

positive. Consequently, we expect f  (x) > 0 for all values of x in its domain. Furthermore, as x increases, the

slopes  of  the  tangent  lines   to  f  (x)  are  decreasing     and    we    expect     to  see    a  corresponding   decrease    in  f         We

                                                                                                                                            (x).

also observe that f (0) is undefined and that            lim             (x)   =   +,     corresponding        to  a  vertical  tangent  to  f (x)  at

                                                                  f

0.

     The derivative f (x) is positive everywhere because
                 the function f(x) is increasing.

In [link] we found that for f (x) = x2 - 2x, f  (x) = 2x - 2. The graphs of these functions are shown in
[link]. Observe that f(x) is decreasing for x < 1. For these same values of x, f  (x) < 0. For values of
x > 1, f(x) is increasing and f  (x) > 0. Also, f(x) has a horizontal tangent at x = 1 and f  (1) = 0.
   The derivative f  (x) < 0 where the function f (x) is
    decreasing and f  (x) > 0 where f(x) is increasing.

        The derivative is zero where the function has a
                         horizontal tangent.

   Solution:
   The solution is shown in the following graph. Observe that f(x) is increasing and f  (x) > 0 on (- 2, 3).
   Also, f(x) is decreasing and f  (x) < 0 on (-, -2) and on (3, +). Also note that f(x) has
   horizontal tangents at - 2 and 3, and f  (-2) = 0 and f  (3) = 0.

Hint
The graph of f (x) is positive where f(x) is increasing.

Derivatives and Continuity

Now that we can graph a derivative, let's examine the behavior of the graphs. First, we consider the relationship
between differentiability and continuity. We will see that if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be
continuous there; however, a function that is continuous at a point need not be differentiable at that point. In
fact, a function may be continuous at a point and fail to be differentiable at the point for one of several reasons.
Note:
Differentiability Implies Continuity
Let f(x) be a function and a be in its domain. If f(x) is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.

Proof

If f(x) is differentiable at a, then f (a) exists and
Equation:

                                                                                   f (x) - f (a)

                                                     f (a) = lim                                             .

                                                                 xa                x-a

We want to show that f(x) is continuous at a by showing that limf(x) = f(a). Thus,

                                                                                                                                                                                                              xa

Equation:

lim f (x)    = lim (f (x) - f (a) + f (a))

xa                    xa

                               f (x)-f (a)

             = lim (                         (x - a) + f (a))                           Multiply and divide f (x) - f (a) by x - a.

                      xa       x-a

                               f (x)-f (a)

             = (lim            x-a          )  (lim (x - a)) + lim f (a)

                           xa               xa                   xa

             = f (a)  0 + f (a)

             = f (a ).

Therefore, since f (a) is defined and limf (x) = f(a), we conclude that f is continuous at a.

                                                                                                                           xa



We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity, but now we consider whether continuity implies

differentiability. To determine an answer to this question, we examine the function f (x) = |x|. This function is

continuous   everywhere;       however,     f        is  undefined.  This          observation                  leads  us  to  believe                                                                            that  continuity  does

                                                (0)

not imply differentiability. Let's explore further. For f (x) = |x|,

Equation:

                                                                    f (x) - f (0)                  |x| - |0|               |x|
                                                                                   = lim
                                                                                                                = lim           .
                                                                                         x0 x - 0
                                    f (0) = lim

                                               x0          x-0                                                     x0 x

This limit does not exist because
Equation:

                                                            |x|                                         |x|  = 1.

                                                 lim             = -1 and lim

See [link].
The function f (x) = |x| is continuous at 0 but is not
                     differentiable at 0.

Let's consider some additional situations in which a continuous function fails to be differentiable. Consider the

function   f  (x)  =     3

                      x:

Equation:

                                                                                                            3             1

                                                                         x - 0                                 = lim            = +.

                                                                                                                  x0 3       2
                                                                                                                          x
                                         f (0) = lim
                                                              x0 x - 0

Thus  f    (0)  does  not  exist.  A  quick   look  at  the  graph  of                                         f  (x)  =     3  clarifies  the  situation.  The  function  has  a

      The  function   f    (x)  =     3  has  a  vertical  tangent  at

                                   x

x = 0. It is continuous at 0 but is not differentiable at

The function f (x) = {                              1  also has a derivative that exhibits interesting behavior at 0. We see

                                     f (0) = lim

                                                 x0                                                        x-0              x0      x

This limit does not exist, essentially because the slopes of the secant lines continuously change direction as they
approach zero ([link]).

                                                                                                        1

The function f (x) = {x sin ( x ) if x  0 is

                                                        0 if x = 0

              not differentiable at 0.

In summary:

1. We observe that if a function is not continuous, it cannot be differentiable, since every differentiable

      function must be continuous. However, if a function is continuous, it may still fail to be differentiable.

2. We saw that f (x) = |x| failed to be differentiable at 0 because the limit of the slopes of the tangent lines

      on the left and right were not the same. Visually, this resulted in a sharp corner on the graph of the function

      at 0. From this we conclude that in order to be differentiable at a point, a function must be "smooth" at that

      point.

3.    As  we  saw  in  the  example  of  f  (x)  =     3  a                                                function  fails  to  be  differentiable  at  a  point  where  there  is  a

                                                    x,

      vertical tangent line.
4. As we saw with f (x) = {                        1  a function may fail to be differentiable at a point in more

                           x sin ( ) if x  0

   Problem:
   A Piecewise Function that is Continuous and Differentiable

A toy company wants to design a track for a toy car that starts out along a parabolic curve and then

converts to a straight line ([link]). The function that describes the track is to have the form

           1  2

                x + bx + c if x < -10  where x and f(x) are in inches. For the car to move smoothly

           10

f (x) = {

              1  5

              - x + if x  -10
              4  2

along the track, the function f(x) must be both continuous and differentiable at -10. Find values of b

and c that make f(x) both continuous and differentiable.

 For the car to move smoothly along the track, the
function must be both continuous and differentiable.

Solution:

For the function to be continuous at x = -10, lim f (x) = f (-10). Thus, since

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        -

                                                                                                                                                           x-10

Equation:

                                       1              2

                        lim f (x) =            (-10) - 10b + c = 10 - 10b + c

                    x-10-              10

and f (-10) = 5, we must have 10 - 10b + c = 5. Equivalently, we have c = 10b - 5.

For the function to be differentiable at -10,
Equation:

                                                         f (x) - f (-10)

                             f (10) =          lim

                                               x-10       x + 10

must exist. Since f (x) is defined using different rules on the right and the left, we must evaluate this
limit from the right and the left and then set them equal to each other:

Higher-Order Derivatives

The derivative of a function is itself a function, so we can find the derivative of a derivative. For example, the
derivative of a position function is the rate of change of position, or velocity. The derivative of velocity is the
rate of change of velocity, which is acceleration. The new function obtained by differentiating the derivative is
called the second derivative. Furthermore, we can continue to take derivatives to obtain the third derivative,
fourth derivative, and so on. Collectively, these are referred to as higher-order derivatives. The notation for
the higher-order derivatives of y = f(x) can be expressed in any of the following forms:

Key Concepts

The derivative of a function f(x) is the function whose value at x is f (x).

The graph of a derivative of a function f(x) is related to the graph of f(x). Where f(x) has a tangent line

with positive slope, f  (x) > 0. Where f(x) has a tangent line with negative slope, f  (x) < 0. Where

f (x)  has  a  horizontal  tangent  line,         (x)  =  0.

                                           f

If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point. A function is not differentiable

at a point if it is not continuous at the point, if it has a vertical tangent line at the point, or if the graph has a

sharp corner or cusp.

Higher-order derivatives are derivatives of derivatives, from the second derivative to the nth derivative.

Finding derivatives of functions by using the definition of the derivative can be a lengthy and, for certain

functions, a rather challenging process. For example, previously we found that                                       d                1  by using a
                                                                                                                                  2x
                                                                                                                          (x) =

                                                                                                                    dx

process that involved multiplying an expression by a conjugate prior to evaluating a limit. The process that we

could use to evaluate    d            3  using  the    definition,   while  similar,  is  more                 complicated.   In  this  section,  we  develop
                        dx
                              (x)

rules for finding derivatives that allow us to bypass this process. We begin with the basics.

The Basic Rules

The  functions  f  (x)  =  c  and  g  (x)  =        n  where  n  is  a  positive  integer  are                 the  building  blocks  from  which  all

                                                x

polynomials and rational functions are constructed. To find derivatives of polynomials and rational functions

efficiently without resorting to the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for

differentiating these basic functions.

The Constant Rule

We first apply the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the constant function, f (x) = c. For
this function, both f (x) = c and f (x + h) = c, so we obtain the following result:
Equation:

                                                                                            f (x+h)-f (x)

                                                       f (x)         = lim

                                                                                                            h
                                                                              h0

                                                                                            c-c

                                                                     = lim

                                                                                               h
                                                                              h0

                                                                                             0

                                                                     = lim

                                                                                            h
                                                                              h0

                                                                     = lim 0 = 0.

                                                                              h0

The rule for differentiating constant functions is called the constant rule. It states that the derivative of a constant
function is zero; that is, since a constant function is a horizontal line, the slope, or the rate of change, of a constant
function is 0. We restate this rule in the following theorem.

Note:
The Constant Rule
Let c be a constant.
If f (x) = c, then f (c) = 0.
Alternatively, we may express this rule as
Equation:

                                                                      d
                                                                            (c) = 0.

                                                                     dx

At this point, you might see a pattern beginning to develop for derivatives of the form dx d (xn). We continue our

examination  of  derivative    formulas  by  differentiating  power     functions   of  the  form  f  (x)  =      n  where  n   is  a

                                                                                                              x

positive integer. We develop formulas for derivatives of this type of function in stages, beginning with positive

integer powers. Before stating and proving the general rule for derivatives of functions of this form, we take a look

at a specific case,   d  (x3).  As  we  go  through  this  derivation,  note  that  the  technique    used  in  this  case  is  essentially
                     dx

the same as the technique used to prove the general case.

             h)

As we shall see, the procedure for finding the derivative of the general form f (x) = xn is very similar. Although

it is often unwise to draw general conclusions from specific examples, we note that when we differentiate

f  (x)  =      3  the   power     on  x             becomes           the  coefficient     of      2  in  the  derivative  and  the  power    on   x  in  the  derivative

           x,                                                                                  x

decreases by 1. The following theorem states that the power rule holds for all positive integer powers of x. We

will eventually extend this result to negative integer powers. Later, we will see that this rule may also be extended

first to rational powers of x and then to arbitrary powers of x. Be aware, however, that this rule does not apply to

functions in which a constant is raised to a variable power, such as f(x) = 3x.

Note:
The Power Rule
Let n be a positive integer. If f (x) = xn, then
Equation:

                                                                                                             n-1

                                                                                       f (x) = nx              .

Alternatively, we may express this rule as
Equation:

                                                        d   n                 n-1

                                                            x = nx                     .

                                                        dx

Proof

For f (x) = xn where n is a positive integer, we have
Equation:

                                                                                    n        n

                                                                         (x + h) - x

                                                f (x) = lim                                     .

                                                           h0                    h

Equation:

                        n         n        n-1          n                                 n                             n-1          n

                                                                          n-2 2                             n-3 3

             Since (x + h) = x + nx             h+( )x                        h +( )x                        h + ... + nxh     +h ,

                                                        2                                 3

we see that
Equation:

                     n         n        n-1          n                              n                              n-1         n

                                                                       n-2 2                          n-3 3

             (x + h) - x = nx                h+( )x                      h +( )x                   h + ... + nxh            +h .

                                                     2                              3

Next, divide both sides by h:
Equation:

                                         n-1         n      n-2 2                   n        n-3 3                 n-1         n

                     n         n       nx    h+( )x                      h +( )x                   h + ... + nxh            +h

             (x + h) - x                             2                              3

                                  =                                                                                               .

             h                                                                            h

Thus,
Equation:

                     n         n

             (x + h) - x                   n-1    n                              n                                 n-2      n-1

                                                                    n-2                            n-3 2

                                  = nx          +( )x          h+( )x                        h + ... + nxh              +h        .

             h                                    2                              3

Finally,
Equation:

The Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules

We find our next differentiation rules by looking at derivatives of sums, differences, and constant multiples of
functions. Just as when we work with functions, there are rules that make it easier to find derivatives of functions
that we add, subtract, or multiply by a constant. These rules are summarized in the following theorem.

Note:
Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules
Let f(x) and g(x) be differentiable functions and k be a constant. Then each of the following equations holds.
Sum Rule. The derivative of the sum of a function f and a function g is the same as the sum of the derivative of f
and the derivative of g.
Equation:

                                   d                         d                 d
                                         (f (x) + g (x)) =         (f (x)) +         (g (x));

                                  dx                        dx                dx

that is,
Equation:

                                                                                 

                      f or j (x) = f (x) + g (x), j (x) = f (x) + g (x).

Difference Rule. The derivative of the difference of a function f and a function g is the same as the difference of
the derivative of f and the derivative of g:
Equation:

                                  d                         d                 d
                           d                         d                 d
                                 (f (x) - g (x)) =         (f (x)) -         (g (x));

                          dx                        dx                dx

that is,
Equation:

                                                                                   
                          f or j (x) = f (x) - g (x), j (x) = f (x) - g (x).

Constant Multiple Rule. The derivative of a constant k multiplied by a function f is the same as the constant

                                dx                        dx

that is,
Equation:

                                                                      
                          f or j (x) = kf (x), j (x) = kf (x).

Proof

We provide only the proof of the sum rule here. The rest follow in a similar manner.

For differentiable functions f (x) and g (x), we set j (x) = f (x) + g (x). Using the limit definition of the
derivative we have
Equation:

                                                          j (x + h) - j (x)

                              

                              j (x) = lim                                    .

                                               h0         h

By substituting j (x + h) = f (x + h) + g (x + h) and j (x) = f (x) + g (x), we obtain
Equation:

                                            (f (x + h) + g (x + h)) - (f (x) + g (x))

                 

                 j (x) = lim                                                           .

                          h0                              h

Rearranging and regrouping the terms, we have
Equation:

                                f (x + h) - f (x)             g (x + h) - g(x)

                 j (x) = lim (                            +                            ).

                          h0                   h                                h

We now apply the sum law for limits and the definition of the derivative to obtain
Equation:

                          f (x + h) - f (x)               g (x + h) - g(x)                 

           j (x) = lim (                       ) + lim (                             ) = f (x) + g (x).

   Applying the Constant Multiple Rule

   Find the derivative of g (x) = 3x2 and compare it to the derivative of f (x) = x2.

Solution:

We use the power rule directly:
Equation:

                                      g (x) =                 (3x ) = 3          (x ) = 3 (2x) = 6x.

Since  f  (x)  =      2  has  derivative  f          (x)  =  2x,  we  see  that  the  derivative  of  g  (x)  is  3  times  the  derivative  of

f (x). This relationship is illustrated in [link].

   Problem:
   Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

   Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f (x) = x2 - 4x + 6 at x = 1.

   Solution:

   To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope. To find the point, compute
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                             2

                                                                                                   f (1) = 1 - 4 (1) + 6 = 3.

   This gives us the point (1, 3). Since the slope of the tangent line at 1 is f  (1), we must first find f  (x).
   Using the definition of a derivative, we have
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                      

                                                                                                                  f (x) = 2x - 4

   so the slope of the tangent line is f  (1) = -2. Using the point-slope formula, we see that the equation of the
   tangent line is
   Equation:

                                                                                                            y - 3 = -2 (x - 1).

   Putting the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, we obtain
   Equation:
                                                          y = -2x + 5.

The Product Rule

Now that we have examined the basic rules, we can begin looking at some of the more advanced rules. The first

one examines the derivative of the product of two functions. Although it might be tempting to assume that the

derivative of the product is the product of the derivatives, similar to the sum and difference rules, the product rule

does  not  follow  this  pattern.  To  see  why  we  cannot  use  this  pattern,  consider  the  function  f  (x)  =      2  whose

                                                                                                                      x,

derivative is f  (x) = 2x and not (x)  (x) = 1  1 = 1. d d
                                       dx        dx

Note:
Product Rule
Let f(x) and g(x) be differentiable functions. Then
Equation:

                                    d                      d                        d
                                          (f (x)g (x)) =         (f (x))  g (x) +         (g (x))  f (x).

                                   dx                     dx                       dx

That is,
Equation:

                                                                                            

                         if j (x) = f (x)g(x), then j (x) = f (x)g (x) + g (x)f (x).

This means that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second
function plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.

Proof

We begin by assuming that f(x) and g(x) are differentiable functions. At a key point in this proof we need to use
the fact that, since g(x) is differentiable, it is also continuous. In particular, we use the fact that since g(x) is
continuous, limg (x + h) = g(x).

                                        h0

By applying the limit definition of the derivative to j (x) = f (x)g (x), we obtain
Equation:
                                         f (x + h)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x)

                            j (x) = lim                                                 .

                                     h0                                 h

By adding and subtracting f (x)g(x + h) in the numerator, we have
Equation:

                                         f (x + h)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x + h) + f (x)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x)

             

             j (x) = lim                                                                                    .

                        h0                                              h

After breaking apart this quotient and applying the sum law for limits, the derivative becomes
Equation:

                        f (x + h)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x + h)                             f (x)g (x + h) - f (x)g (x)

  j (x) = lim (                                                         ) + lim (                                    ).

             h0                      h                                       h0            h

Rearranging, we obtain
Equation:

                                                 f (x + h) - f (x)                      g (x + h) - g (x)

                                                                     g(x + h)) + lim (                      f (x)).

             j (x) = lim (

                        h0      h                                            h0         h

By using the continuity of g (x), the definition of the derivatives of f(x) and g(x), and applying the limit laws, we
arrive at the product rule,
Equation:

                                                                           

                                   j (x) = f (x)g (x) + g (x)f (x).

  Solution:

  Since j (x) = f (x)g (x), j (x) = f  (x)g (x) + g (x)f(x), and hence
  Equation:

For j (x) = (x2 + 2)(3x3 - 5x), find j(x) by applying the product rule. Check the result by first finding

Solution:

If we set f (x) = x2 + 2 and g (x) = 3x3 - 5x, then f  (x) = 2x and g (x) = 9x2 - 5. Thus,
Equation:

                                                                                              3                      2  2
                            j (x) = f (x)g (x) + g (x)f (x) = (2x) (3x - 5x) + (9x - 5)(x + 2).

Simplifying, we have
Equation:

                                                                               4           2

To check, we see that j (x) = 3x5 + x3 - 10x and, consequently, j (x) = 15x4 + 3x2 - 10.

The Quotient Rule

Having developed and practiced the product rule, we now consider differentiating quotients of functions. As we
see in the following theorem, the derivative of the quotient is not the quotient of the derivatives; rather, it is the
derivative of the function in the numerator times the function in the denominator minus the derivative of the
function in the denominator times the function in the numerator, all divided by the square of the function in the
denominator. In order to better grasp why we cannot simply take the quotient of the derivatives, keep in mind that
Equation:

                                                                               d        3                 2
                                                                                   (x )

That is,

The proof of the quotient rule is very similar to the proof of the product rule, so it is omitted here. Instead, we
apply this new rule for finding derivatives in the next example.

   Problem:
   Applying the Quotient Rule

   Use the quotient rule to find the derivative of k (x) = 4x+3 . 5x2

Solution:

Let f (x) = 5x2 and g (x) = 4x + 3. Thus, f  (x) = 10x and g (x) = 4. Substituting into the quotient rule,
we have
Equation:

                                f  (x)g (x) - g (x)f (x)                              10x (4x + 3) - 4(5x2)

                       k (x) =                                                     =                                           .

                                       (g (x))                                                 (4x + 3)

Simplifying, we obtain
Equation:

                                                       20x2 + 30x

                                           k (x) =                                  .

Apply the quotient rule with f (x) = 3x + 1 and g (x) = 4x - 3.

It  is  now  possible  to  use  the  quotient  rule  to        extend  the  power  rule  to  find  derivatives                  of  functions  of  the   form       k

                                                                                                                                                                x

where k is a negative integer.

Note:
Extended Power Rule
If k is a negative integer, then
Equation:

                                                               dk                  k-1

                                                                       (x ) = kx         .

                                                               dx

Proof

If k is a negative integer, we may set n = -k, so that n is a positive integer with k = -n. Since for each positive

integer n, x-n =        1  ,  we  may  now  apply    the       quotient  rule  by  setting   f  (x)  =               1  and  g  (x)  =      n  In  this  case,
                       xn
                                                                                                                                        x.

f  (x) = 0 and g (x) = nxn-1. Thus,

Equation:

                                                                               n             n-1
                                                                         0 (x ) - 1 (nx
                                                d                                               )

                                                                   -n                                             .
                                                                                   (xn 2 )
                                                      (x ) =
                                               dx

Simplifying, we see that
Equation:

                                        d                      -nxn-1    = -nx     (n-1)-2n     = -nx                   -n-1 .
                                                                    x2n
                                                           -n

                                              (x ) =
                                       dx

Finally, observe that since k = -n, by substituting we have
Equation:

                                                               d            k      k-1

It may seem tempting to use the quotient rule to find this derivative, and it would certainly not be incorrect to

do  so.  However,  it  is  far   easier  to  differentiate  this  function  by  first  rewriting  it  as  f  (x)  =           -2

Combining Differentiation Rules

As we have seen throughout the examples in this section, it seldom happens that we are called on to apply just one
differentiation rule to find the derivative of a given function. At this point, by combining the differentiation rules,
we may find the derivatives of any polynomial or rational function. Later on we will encounter more complex
combinations of differentiation rules. A good rule of thumb to use when applying several rules is to apply the rules
in reverse of the order in which we would evaluate the function.

   Problem:
   Determining Where a Function Has a Horizontal Tangent

Determine  the  values  of  x  for  which  f                     (x)  =      3  -                                 2  +      8x  +  1  has  a  horizontal  tangent  line.

                                                                         x                               7x

Solution:

To find the values of x for which f(x) has a horizontal tangent line, we must solve f  (x) = 0. Since
Equation:

                                                                      2
                                    f (x) = 3x - 14x + 8 = (3x - 2) (x - 4),

we must solve (3x - 2) (x - 4) = 0. Thus we see that the function has horizontal tangent lines at x =                                                                        2
                                                                                                                                                                             3

and x = 4 as shown in the following graph.

   Finding a Velocity

The position of an object on a coordinate axis at time t is given by s (t) = t2+1 . t What is the initial velocity
of the object?

Solution:

Since the initial velocity is v (0) = s (0), begin by finding s(t) by applying the quotient rule:
Equation:

                                                              2                                            2

                                                  1 (t + 1) - 2t(t)                       1-t

                                           

                                      s (t) =                                       =                         .

                                                         (t2 2 + 1)                    (t2 2 + 1)

After evaluating, we see that v (0) = 1.

Note:
Formula One Grandstands
Formula One car races can be very exciting to watch and attract a lot of spectators. Formula One track designers
have to ensure sufficient grandstand space is available around the track to accommodate these viewers. However,
car racing can be dangerous, and safety considerations are paramount. The grandstands must be placed where
spectators will not be in danger should a driver lose control of a car ([link]).

   The grandstand next to a straightaway of the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya race track, located where the
                                                  spectators are not in danger.

**********

Safety is especially a concern on turns. If a driver does not slow down enough before entering the turn, the car

may slide off the racetrack. Normally, this just results in a wider turn, which slows the driver down. But if the

driver loses control completely, the car may fly off the track entirely, on a path tangent to the curve of the

racetrack.

Suppose you are designing a new Formula One track. One section of the track can be modeled by the function

f  (x)  =      3  +           2  +  x  ([link]).  The  current  plan  calls  for  grandstands  to  be  built  along  the  first  straightaway  and

           x         3x

around a portion of the first curve. The plans call for the front corner of the grandstand to be located at the point

(-1.9, 2.8). We want to determine whether this location puts the spectators in danger if a driver loses control of

the car.
    (a) One section of the racetrack can be modeled by the function f (x) = x3 + 3x2 + x. (b) The front
                                   corner of the grandstand is located at (-1.9, 2.8).

   1. Physicists have determined that drivers are most likely to lose control of their cars as they are coming into a
      turn, at the point where the slope of the tangent line is 1. Find the (x, y) coordinates of this point near the
      turn.

   2. Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at this point.
   3. To determine whether the spectators are in danger in this scenario, find the x-coordinate of the point where

      the tangent line crosses the line y = 2.8. Is this point safely to the right of the grandstand? Or are the
      spectators in danger?
   4. What if a driver loses control earlier than the physicists project? Suppose a driver loses control at the point
      (-2.5, 0.625). What is the slope of the tangent line at this point?
   5. If a driver loses control as described in part 4, are the spectators safe?
   6. Should you proceed with the current design for the grandstand, or should the grandstands be moved?

Key Concepts

      The derivative of a constant function is zero.
      The derivative of a power function is a function in which the power on x becomes the coefficient of the term
      and the power on x in the derivative decreases by 1.
      The derivative of a constant c multiplied by a function f is the same as the constant multiplied by the
      derivative.
      The derivative of the sum of a function f and a function g is the same as the sum of the derivative of f and the
      derivative of g.
      The derivative of the difference of a function f and a function g is the same as the difference of the derivative
      of f and the derivative of g.
      The derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function
      plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.
      The derivative of the quotient of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function
      minus the derivative of the second function times the first function, all divided by the square of the second
       function.
       We used the limit definition of the derivative to develop formulas that allow us to find derivatives without
       resorting to the definition of the derivative. These formulas can be used singly or in combination with each
       other.

For  the  following  exercises,               find  f        for                                                each  function.

      Determine a new value of a quantity from the old value and the
      amount of change.
      Calculate the average rate of change and explain how it differs from
      the instantaneous rate of change.
      Apply rates of change to displacement, velocity, and acceleration of an

      Predict the future population from the present value and the population
      growth rate.
      Use derivatives to calculate marginal cost and revenue in a business
      situation.

In this section we look at some applications of the derivative by focusing on
the interpretation of the derivative as the rate of change of a function. These
applications include acceleration and velocity in physics, population
growth rates in biology, and marginal functions in economics.

Amount of Change Formula

One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a
function at a point by using a known value of a function at some given point
together with its rate of change at the given point. If f(x) is a function
defined on an interval [a, a + h], then the amount of change of f(x) over
the interval is the change in the y values of the function over that interval
and is given by
Equation:

                                                                   f (a + h) - f (a).

The average rate of change of the function f over that same interval is the
ratio of the amount of change over that interval to the corresponding change
in the x values. It is given by
Equation:
                                 f (a + h) - f (a)
                                                                            .

                                                    h

As we already know, the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at a is its
derivative
Equation:

                                         f (a + h) - f (a)

                    f (a) = lim                                                   .

                                     h0          h

For small enough values of h, f  (a)  h . f(a+h)-f(a) We can then solve for
f (a + h) to get the amount of change formula:
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                        

                                                       f (a + h)  f (a) + f (a)h.

We  can  use  this  formula  if  we  know  only  f (a)  and                    f        and  wish  to

                                                                                   (a)

estimate the value of f (a + h). For example, we may use the current

population of a city and the rate at which it is growing to estimate its

population in the near future. As we can see in [link], we are approximating

f(a + h) by the y coordinate at a + h on the line tangent to f(x) at x = a.

Observe that the accuracy of this estimate depends on the value of h as well

as the value of f  (a).
      The new value of a changed quantity equals the
       original value plus the rate of change times the
     interval of change: f (a + h)  f (a) + f  (a)h.

Note:
Here is an interesting demonstration of rate of change.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Estimating the Value of a Function
   If f (3) = 2 and f  (3) = 5, estimate f(3.2).
   Solution:
   Begin by finding h. We have h = 3.2 - 3 = 0.2. Thus,
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                        

           f (3.2) = f (3 + 0.2)  f (3) + (0.2)f (3) = 2 + 0.2 (5) = 3.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem: Given f (10) = -5 and f  (10) = 6, estimate f (10.1).

   Solution:

      -4.4

Hint
Use the same process as in the preceding example.

Motion along a Line

Another use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. We have
described velocity as the rate of change of position. If we take the
derivative of the velocity, we can find the acceleration, or the rate of change
of velocity. It is also important to introduce the idea of speed, which is the
magnitude of velocity. Thus, we can state the following mathematical
definitions.

Note:
Definition
Let s (t) be a function giving the position of an object at time t.
The velocity of the object at time t is given by v (t) = s (t).
The speed of the object at time t is given by |v (t)|.
The acceleration of the object at t is given by a (t) = v (t) = s (t).

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Comparing Instantaneous Velocity and Average Velocity

A ball is dropped from a height of 64 feet. Its height above ground (in

feet)  t  seconds  later  is  given  by  s  (t)  =                    2  +  64.

                                                    -16t

   a. What is the instantaneous velocity of the ball when it hits the
      ground?

   b. What is the average velocity during its fall?

Solution:

The first thing to do is determine how long it takes the ball to reach
the ground. To do this, set s (t) = 0. Solving -16t2 + 64 = 0, we
get t = 2, so it take 2 seconds for the ball to reach the ground.

   a. The instantaneous velocity of the ball as it strikes the ground is
      v (2). Since v (t) = s (t) = -32t, we obtain v (t) = -64 f t/s.

   b. The average velocity of the ball during its fall is
      Equation:

                            s (2) - s (0)           0 - 64

                  vave =                     =                  = -32 f t/s.

   Problem:
   Interpreting the Relationship between v (t) and a (t)

A particle moves along a coordinate axis in the positive direction to

the  right.  Its  position  at  time  t  is  given  by  s  (t)  =     3  -  4t  +  2.  Find

                                                                   t

v (1) and a (1) and use these values to answer the following

questions.

a. Is the particle moving from left to right or from right to left at
  time t = 1?

b. Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at time t = 1?

Solution:
Begin by finding v (t) and a (t).
v (t) = s (t) = 3t2 - 4 and a (t) = v (t) = s (t) = 6t.
Evaluating these functions at t = 1, we obtain v (1) = -1 and

a (1) = 6.
a. Because v (1) < 0, the particle is moving from right to left.
b. Because v (1) < 0 and a (1) > 0, velocity and acceleration are

  acting in opposite directions. In other words, the particle is being
  accelerated in the direction opposite the direction in which it is
  traveling, causing |v (t)| to decrease. The particle is slowing
  down.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Position and Velocity

The position of a particle moving along a coordinate axis is given by

          3       2
s (t) = t - 9t + 24t + 4, t  0.

a. Find v (t).
b. At what time(s) is the particle at rest?
c. On what time intervals is the particle moving from left to right?

  From right to left?
d. Use the information obtained to sketch the path of the particle

  along a coordinate axis.

Solution:

a. The velocity is the derivative of the position function:
  Equation:

                                                2
                         v (t) = s (t) = 3t - 18t + 24.

b. The particle is at rest when v (t) = 0, so set

       2  -  18t  +  24  =  0.  Factoring  the  left-hand  side  of  the  equation

3t

produces 3 (t - 2) (t - 4) = 0. Solving, we find that the particle

is at rest at t = 2 and t = 4.
c. The particle is moving from left to right when v (t) > 0 and
  from right to left when v (t) < 0. [link] gives the analysis of the
  sign of v (t) for t  0, but it does not represent the axis along
  which the particle is moving.

      The sign of v(t) determines the direction of the particle.

  Since 3t2 - 18t + 24 > 0 on [0, 2)  (2, +), the particle is
  moving from left to right on these intervals.
  Since 3t2 - 18t + 24 < 0 on (2, 4), the particle is moving from
  right to left on this interval.
d. Before we can sketch the graph of the particle, we need to know
  its position at the time it starts moving (t = 0) and at the times
  that it changes direction (t = 2, 4). We have
  s (0) = 4, s (2) = 24, and s (4) = 20. This means that the
  particle begins on the coordinate axis at 4 and changes direction
  at 0 and 20 on the coordinate axis. The path of the particle is
  shown on a coordinate axis in [link].

            The path of the particle can be determined by
                              analyzing v(t).
Note:

   Solution:

   left to right
Hint

Find v (3) and look at the sign.

Population Change

In addition to analyzing velocity, speed, acceleration, and position, we can
use derivatives to analyze various types of populations, including those as
diverse as bacteria colonies and cities. We can use a current population,
together with a growth rate, to estimate the size of a population in the
future. The population growth rate is the rate of change of a population and
consequently can be represented by the derivative of the size of the
population.

Note:
Definition
If P (t) is the number of entities present in a population, then the
population growth rate of P (t) is defined to be P  (t).

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Estimating a Population

   The population of a city is tripling every 5 years. If its current
   population is 10,000, what will be its approximate population 2 years
   from now?

Solution:

Let P (t) be the population (in thousands) t years from now. Thus, we
know that P (0) = 10 and based on the information, we anticipate
P (5) = 30. Now estimate P  (0), the current growth rate, using
Equation:

        P (5) - P (0)     30 - 10

P (0)                  =                            = 4.

        5-0                                      5

By applying [link] to P (t), we can estimate the population 2 years
from now by writing
Equation:

                                                                                                                 

                         P (2)  P (0) + (2)P (0)  10 + 2 (4) = 18;

thus, in 2 years the population will be 18,000.

   Solution:

Hint

Use P (3)  P (0) + 3P  (0).

Changes in Cost and Revenue

In addition to analyzing motion along a line and population growth,
derivatives are useful in analyzing changes in cost, revenue, and profit. The
concept of a marginal function is common in the fields of business and
economics and implies the use of derivatives. The marginal cost is the
derivative of the cost function. The marginal revenue is the derivative of the
revenue function. The marginal profit is the derivative of the profit
function, which is based on the cost function and the revenue function.

Note:
Definition
If C (x) is the cost of producing x items, then the marginal cost MC (x)
is M C (x) = C  (x).
If R (x) is the revenue obtained from selling x items, then the marginal
revenue M R (x) is M R (x) = R (x).
If P (x) = R (x) - C (x) is the profit obtained from selling x items, then
the marginal profit MP (x) is defined to be

M P (x) = P  (x) = M R (x) - M C (x) = R (x) - C  (x).

We can roughly approximate
Equation:
                                                                                  C (x + h) - C (x)

                                                                   

                    M C (x) = C (x) = lim

                                            h0       h

by choosing an appropriate value for h. Since x represents objects, a

reasonable and small value for h is 1. Thus, by substituting h = 1, we get

the approximation M C (x) = C  (x)  C (x + 1) - C (x). Consequently,

C  (x) for a given value of x can be thought of as the change in cost

associated with producing one additional item. In a similar way,

MR  (x)  =          (x)  approximates  the  revenue  obtained  by  selling                           one

            R

additional item, and MP (x) = P  (x) approximates the profit obtained by

producing and selling one additional item.

   Problem:
   Applying Marginal Revenue

   Assume that the number of barbeque dinners that can be sold, x, can
   be related to the price charged, p, by the equation

     p (x) = 9 - 0.03x, 0  x  300.

   In this case, the revenue in dollars obtained by selling x barbeque
   dinners is given by
   Equation:

                                                                                                                                                               2

     R (x) = xp (x) = x (9 - 0.03x) = -0.03x + 9x f or 0  x  300.

   Use the marginal revenue function to estimate the revenue obtained
   from selling the 101st barbeque dinner. Compare this to the actual
   revenue obtained from the sale of this dinner.

   Solution:
   First, find the marginal revenue function:

                                                      

     M R (x) = R (x) = -0.06x + 9.

   Next, use R (100) to approximate R (101) - R (100), the revenue
   obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner. Since R (100) = 3, the
   revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is approximately
   $3.

   The actual revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is
   Equation:

                      R (101) - R (100) = 602.97 - 600 = 2.97, or $2.97.

   The marginal revenue is a fairly good estimate in this case and has the
   advantage of being easy to compute.

   dinner.

   Solution:

Use P  (100) to approximate P (101) - P (100).
Key Concepts

      Using f (a + h)  f (a) + f  (a)h, it is possible to estimate
      f (a + h) given f  (a) and f (a).
      The rate of change of position is velocity, and the rate of change of
      velocity is acceleration. Speed is the absolute value, or magnitude, of
      velocity.
      The population growth rate and the present population can be used to
      predict the size of a future population.
      Marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit functions can be
      used to predict, respectively, the cost of producing one more item, the
      revenue obtained by selling one more item, and the profit obtained by
      producing and selling one more item.

For the following exercises, the given functions represent the position of a
particle traveling along a horizontal line.

   a. Find the velocity and acceleration functions.

[T] The Holling type I equation is described by f (x) = ax, where x
is the amount of prey available and a > 0 is the rate at which the
predator meets the prey for consumption.

      explain physically what the derivative implies.

Solution:
a.

b. f  (x) = a. The more increase in prey, the more growth for
predators. c. f (x) = 0. As the amount of prey increases, the rate at
which the predator population growth increases is constant. d. This
equation assumes that if there is more prey, the predator is able to
increase consumption linearly. This assumption is unphysical because

      function describe compared with the Holling type II function?

Solution:

b. f  (x) = 2 2 2 . 2axn2 When the amount of prey increases, the predator

growth increases. c. f (x) = 2 2 3 . When the amount of prey
           (n +x )

is extremely small, the rate at which predator growth is increasing is

increasing, but when the amount of prey reaches above a certain

threshold, the rate at which predator growth is increasing begins to

decrease. d. At lower levels of prey, the prey is more easily able to

avoid detection by the predator, so fewer prey individuals are

consumed, resulting in less predator growth.

Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions

      Find the derivatives of the sine and cosine function.
      Find the derivatives of the standard trigonometric functions.
      Calculate the higher-order derivatives of the sine and cosine.

One of the most important types of motion in physics is simple harmonic motion, which is associated with such
systems as an object with mass oscillating on a spring. Simple harmonic motion can be described by using either
sine or cosine functions. In this section we expand our knowledge of derivative formulas to include derivatives of
these and other trigonometric functions. We begin with the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions and then
use them to obtain formulas for the derivatives of the remaining four trigonometric functions. Being able to
calculate the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions will enable us to find the velocity and acceleration of
simple harmonic motion.

Derivatives of the Sine and Cosine Functions

We begin our exploration of the derivative for the sine function by using the formula to make a reasonable guess at
its derivative. Recall that for a function f(x),
Equation:

                                                         f (x + h) - f (x)

                                        f (x) = lim                         .

                                          h0             h

Consequently, for values of h very close to 0, f  (x)  h . f(x+h)-f(x) We see that by using h = 0.01,
Equation:

                                         d               sin (x + 0.01) - sin x
                                               (sin x)                        0.01

                                        dx

By setting D (x) =  sin (x+0.01)-sin x  and using a graphing utility, we can get a graph of an approximation to the

                    0.01

derivative of sin x ([link]).

The graph of the function D (x) looks a lot like
                   a cosine curve.
Upon inspection, the graph of D(x) appears to be very close to the graph of the cosine function. Indeed, we will
show that
Equation:

                                                                                                                 d
                                                                                                                        (sin x) = cos x.

                                                                                                                dx

If we were to follow the same steps to approximate the derivative of the cosine function, we would find that
Equation:

                                                                                                               d
                                                                                                                     (cos x) = -sin x.

                                                                                                             dx

Note:
The Derivatives of sin x and cos x
The derivative of the sine function is the cosine and the derivative of the cosine function is the negative sine.
Equation:

                                                             d
                                                                   (sin x) = cos x

                                                            dx

Equation:

                                                             d
                                                                   (cos x) = -sin x

                                                            dx

Proof

Because the proofs for     d (sin x) = cos x and             d  (cos x)  =  -sin x   use  similar  techniques,  we  provide  only  the

                           dx

proof for   d  (sin x)  =  cos x.  Before  beginning,       recall  two  important   trigonometric  limits  we  learned  in
           dx

Introduction to Limits:

Equation:

                                                     sin h                   cos h - 1
                                           lim
                                           h0 h             = 1 and lim                   = 0.

                                                                         h0  h

The graphs of y = (sinh) and y = (cosh-1) are shown in [link].
                        h                  h
      These graphs show two important limits needed to establish the derivative formulas for the
                                             sine and cosine functions.

We also recall the following trigonometric identity for the sine of the sum of two angles:
Equation:

                                                                                       sin (x + h) = sin x cos h + cos x sin h.

Now that we have gathered all the necessary equations and identities, we proceed with the proof.
Equation:

 d                                  sin (x+h)-sin x                                                  Apply the def inition of the derivative.

[link] shows the relationship between the graph of f (x) = sin x and its derivative f  (x) = cos x. Notice that at

the points where f (x) = sin x has a horizontal tangent, its derivative f  (x) = cos x takes on the value zero. We

also  see    that  where  f  (x)  =  sin x                   is  increasing,                 (x)  =  cos x  >  0  and  where  f  (x)  =  sin x  is  decreasing,

f (x) = cos x < 0.
Where f(x) has a maximum or a minimum, f(x) = 0
that is, f(x) = 0 where f(x) has a horizontal tangent.

    These points are noted with dots on the graphs.

   An Application to Velocity

   A particle moves along a coordinate axis in such a way that its position at time t is given by
   s (t) = 2 sin t - t for 0  t  2. At what times is the particle at rest?
Solution:

To    determine  when  the  particle  is  at  rest,  set        (t)  =   v  (t)  =  0.  Begin       by  finding         (t).  We  obtain

                                                          s                                                       s

so we must solve
Equation:

                                              2 cos t - 1 = 0 f or 0  t  2.

The solutions to this equation are t =               and t =         5   .  Thus  the   particle    is  at  rest  at  times   t  =     and t =  5

                                                                                    cos x
Now apply the quotient rule to obtain
Equation:

                                                                 cos x cos x - (-sin x)sin x

   Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

Find the equation of a line tangent to the graph of f (x) = cot x at x =                                             

                                                                                                                        .

Solution:

To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope at that point. To find the point, compute
Equation:

   Find the derivative of f (x) = csc x + x tan x.

Solution:

To find this derivative, we must use both the sum rule and the product rule. Using the sum rule, we find

In the first term, dx (csc x) = -csc x cot x, d and by applying the product rule to the second term we obtain
Equation:

   An Application to Acceleration

A particle moves along a coordinate axis in such a way that its position at time t is given by
s (t) = 2 - sin t. Find v (/4) and a (/4). Compare these values and decide whether the particle is
speeding up or slowing down.

Solution:

First find v (t) = s (t):
Equation:

                                                                                                                                        

                                                                                                          v (t) = s (t) = -cos t.

Thus,
Equation:

                                                                                                                                      1

                                                                                                          v( ) = -                       .

                                                                                                          4         2
Next, find a (t) = v(t). Thus, a (t) = v (t) = sin t and we have
Equation:

                                                                                                  1
                                                                                    a( ) =               .

                                                                                             4  2

Since v ( )  = - 1                 < 0 and a ( )  =                            1  > 0, we see that velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite

Key Concepts

We can find the derivatives of sin x and cos x by using the definition of derivative and the limit formulas
found earlier. The results are
Equation:

                                                   d                           sin x = cos x   d  cos x = -sin x.

With these two formulas, we can determine the derivatives of all six basic trigonometric functions.

We  have   seen       the    techniques     for  differentiating            basic  functions             n       sin     x,  cos       x,     etc.  )  as  well  as  sums,

                                                                                                 (x ,

differences, products, quotients, and constant multiples of these functions. However, these techniques do not

allow  us  to  differentiate        compositions          of  functions,        such      as  h  (x)          =                     3  or  k  (x)   =  3x2       +   1.  In  this

                                                                                                                 sin(x )

section, we study the rule for finding the derivative of the composition of two or more functions.

Deriving the Chain Rule

When we have a function that is a composition of two or more functions, we could use all of the techniques we
have already learned to differentiate it. However, using all of those techniques to break down a function into
simpler parts that we are able to differentiate can get cumbersome. Instead, we use the chain rule, which states
that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function
times the derivative of the inner function.

To  put  this  rule   into      context,    let's  take   a  look       at  an  example:      h  (x)          =  sin                 3     We     can  think  of  the  derivative  of

                                                                                                                             (x ).

this function with respect to x as the rate of change of sin(x3) relative to the change in x. Consequently, we want

to know how sin(x3) changes as x changes. We can think of this event as a chain reaction: As x changes, x3

changes, which leads to a change in sin (x3). This chain reaction gives us hints as to what is involved in

computing the derivative of sin(x3). First of all, a change in x forcing a change in x3 suggests that somehow the

derivative of x3 is involved. In addition, the change in x3 forcing a change in sin(x3) suggests that the derivative

of  sin(u)   with     respect       to  u,  where    u  =        3  is  also    part  of  the    final        derivative.

                                                             x,

We  can  take   a     more      formal  look     at  the  derivative        of  h  (x)    =    sin                    3  by  setting          up  the  limit  that   would   give  us

                                                                                                              (x )

the derivative at a specific value a in the domain of h (x) = sin (x3).

Equation:

                                                                                   sin (x3) - sin(a3)

                                                              

                                                             h (a) = lim                                                     .

                                                                            xa                x-a

This expression does not seem particularly helpful; however, we can modify it by multiplying and dividing by the

expression         3  -      3  to  obtain

               x         a

Equation:

                                                                            sin (x3) - sin(a3) x3 - a3

                                                   h (a) = lim                                                                             .

                                                                    xa             x3 - a3                               x-a

From the definition of the derivative, we can see that the second factor is the derivative of x3 at x = a. That is,
Equation:

                                                                    x3 - a3               d                                       2

                                                          lim                   =                          3     = 3a .

                                                                                                (x )

                                                          xa x - a                    dx         x=a

However, it might be a little more challenging to recognize that the first term is also a derivative. We can see this

by  letting  u  =         3  and    observing    that   as   x          a,  u          3

                      x                                                            a:
Equation:

                                                      sin (x3)-sin (a3)              sin u-sin (a3)
                                                                                               u-a3
                                              lim            x3-a3         =   lim

                                              xa                              ua3

                                                                                       d

                                                                           du = (sin u)u=a3
                                                                           = cos (a3 ).

Thus, h (a) = cos(a3)  3a2.

In other words, if h (x) = sin (x3), then h (x) = cos (x3)  3x2. Thus, if we think of h (x) = sin(x3) as the

composition (f  g) (x) = f (g (x)) where f (x) = sin x and g (x) = x3, then the derivative of h (x) = sin(x3)

is  the  product  of  the  derivative  of  g  (x)  =      3  and  the  derivative  of   the  function  f  (x)  =  sin x  evaluated  at  the

                                                      x

function g (x) = x3. At this point, we anticipate that for h (x) = sin (g (x)), it is quite likely that

h(x) = cos(g(x))g(x). As we determined above, this is the case for h (x) = sin (x ) 3 .

Now that we have derived a special case of the chain rule, we state the general case and then apply it in a general
form to other composite functions. An informal proof is provided at the end of the section.

Note:
Rule: The Chain Rule
Let f and g be functions. For all x in the domain of g for which g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at
g (x), the derivative of the composite function
Equation:

                                                   h (x) = (f  g)(x) = f (g (x))

is given by
Equation:

                                                                                   
                                                      h (x) = f (g (x))g (x).

Alternatively, if y is a function of u, and u is a function of x, then
Equation:

                                                               dy          dy du

                                                                    =                .

                                                               dx          du dx

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Applying the Chain Rule

   1. To differentiate h (x) = f (g (x)), begin by identifying f(x) and g(x).
   2. Find f(x) and evaluate it at g (x) to obtain f  (g (x)).
   3. Find g(x).
   4. Write h (x) = f  (g (x))  g (x).
Note: When applying the chain rule to the composition of two or more functions, keep in mind that we work our
way from the outside function in. It is also useful to remember that the derivative of the composition of two
functions can be thought of as having two parts; the derivative of the composition of three functions has three
parts; and so on. Also, remember that we never evaluate a derivative at a derivative.

The Chain and Power Rules Combined

We can now apply the chain rule to composite functions, but note that we often need to use it with other rules. For
example, to find derivatives of functions of the form h (x) = (g (x)) , n we need to use the chain rule combined
with the power rule. To do so, we can think of h (x) = (g (x))n as f (g (x)) where f (x) = xn. Then

f  (x) = nxn-1. Thus, f  (g (x)) = n(g (x)) . n-1 This leads us to the derivative of a power function using the
chain rule,
Equation:

                                                                            n-1 

                                               h (x) = n(g (x))             g (x)

Note:
Rule: Power Rule for Composition of Functions
For all values of x for which the derivative is defined, if
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  n

                                                                                                                h (x) = (g(x)) .

Then
Equation:

                                                                            n-1 

                                               h (x) = n(g (x))             g (x ).

                                      (3x +1)

Solution:

First, rewrite h (x) =        1 2 -2

                             2 2 = (3x + 1) .

   Solution:

   Because we are finding an equation of a line, we need a point. The x-coordinate of the point is 2. To find the
   y-coordinate, substitute 2 into h(x). Since h (2) = 2 1 = 1, the point is (2, 1).

                                                                                                                                                                                    (3(2)-5)
For the slope, we need h(2). To find h(x), first we rewrite h (x) = (3x - 5)-2 and apply the power rule
to obtain
Equation:

                                                        -3                       -3

                                     h (x) = -2(3x - 5) (3) = -6(3x - 5) .

By substituting, we have h (2) = -6(3 (2) - 5) = -6. -3 Therefore, the line has equation
y - 1 = -6 (x - 2). Rewriting, the equation of the line is y = -6x + 13.

Combining the Chain Rule with Other Rules

Now that we can combine the chain rule and the power rule, we examine how to combine the chain rule with the
other rules we have learned. In particular, we can use it with the formulas for the derivatives of trigonometric
functions or with the product rule.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using the Chain Rule on a General Cosine Function

   Find the derivative of h (x) = cos (g(x)).

Solution:

Think of h (x) = cos(g(x)) as f (g (x)) where f (x) = cos x. Since f  (x) = -sin x. we have

       (g  (x))  =  -sin  (g  (x)).  Then  we  do  the  following  calculation.

f

Equation:

                    h (x)     = f  (g (x))g (x)         Apply the chain rule.
                              = -sin (g (x))g (x)       Substitute f  (g (x)) = -sin (g (x)).

Thus, the derivative of h (x) = cos (g(x)) is given by h (x) = -sin (g (x))g (x).
In the following example we apply the rule that we have just derived.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using the Chain Rule on a Cosine Function

   Find the derivative of h (x) = cos (5x ) 2 .

Solution:

Let g (x) = 5x2. Then g (x) = 10x. Using the result from the previous example,
Equation:

                                                                                  2
                                                       h (x) = -sin (5x )  10x

                                                                                                                        2

                                                                 = -10x sin (5x ).

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using the Chain Rule on Another Trigonometric Function

   Find the derivative of h (x) = sec (4x5 + 2x).

Solution:

Apply the chain rule to h (x) = sec (g (x)) to obtain
Equation:

                                                                                                                           

                                                   h (x) = sec(g (x) tan (g (x))g (x).

In  this  problem,  g  (x)  =           5  +  2x,  so  we  have        (x)  =               4  +  2.                       Therefore,  we  obtain

                               4x                                g             20x

                                              = (20x + 2)sec (4x + 2x) tan (4x + 2x).

   Solution:
             

     h (x) = 7 cos (7x + 2)

Hint
Apply the chain rule to h (x) = sin g (x) first and then use g (x) = 7x + 2.

At this point we provide a list of derivative formulas that may be obtained by applying the chain rule in
conjunction with the formulas for derivatives of trigonometric functions. Their derivations are similar to those
used in [link] and [link]. For convenience, formulas are also given in Leibniz's notation, which some students find
easier to remember. (We discuss the chain rule using Leibniz's notation at the end of this section.) It is not
absolutely necessary to memorize these as separate formulas as they are all applications of the chain rule to
previously learned formulas.

Hint

Start out by applying the quotient rule. Remember to use the chain rule to differentiate the denominator.

Composites of Three or More Functions

We can now combine the chain rule with other rules for differentiating functions, but when we are differentiating
the composition of three or more functions, we need to apply the chain rule more than once. If we look at this
situation in general terms, we can generate a formula, but we do not need to remember it, as we can simply apply
the chain rule multiple times.

In general terms, first we let
Equation:

                                                                                                           k (x) = h (f (g (x))).

Then, applying the chain rule once we obtain
Equation:

                                                  d                                       d
                                                        (h(f (g (x))) = h(f (g (x)))            f ((g (x))).
                                        k (x) =
                                                 dx                                      dx

Applying the chain rule again, we obtain
Equation:

                                                                           
                                                 k (x) = h (f (g (x))f (g (x))g (x)).

Note:
Rule: Chain Rule for a Composition of Three Functions
For all values of x for which the function is differentiable, if
Equation:

                                                   k (x) = h (f (g (x))),

then
Equation:

                                                                                       
                                                 k (x) = h (f (g (x)))f (g (x))g (x).

In other words, we are applying the chain rule twice.
Notice that the derivative of the composition of three functions has three parts. (Similarly, the derivative of the
composition of four functions has four parts, and so on.) Also, remember, we can always work from the outside in,
taking one derivative at a time.

   Using the Chain Rule in a Velocity Problem
A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time t is given by s (t) = sin (2t) + cos (3t).

What is the velocity of the particle at time t =  

                                                     ?

                                                  6

Solution:

To find v(t), the velocity of the particle at time t, we must differentiate s (t). Thus,
Equation:

                                                           

                             v (t) = s (t) = 2 cos (2t) - 3 sin (3t).

Substituting t = 6  into v(t), we obtain v ( 6 ) = -2.

Proof

At this point, we present a very informal proof of the chain rule. For simplicity's sake we ignore certain issues:
For example, we assume that g (x)  g(a) for x  a in some open interval containing a. We begin by applying
the limit definition of the derivative to the function h(x) to obtain h(a):
Equation:

                                                  f (g(x)) - f (g (a))

                             h (a) = lim                                .

                                        xa               x-a

Rewriting, we obtain
Equation:

                                     xa       g (x) - g (a)

To see that this is true, first recall that since g is differentiable at a, g is also continuous at a. Thus,
Equation:

Next, make the substitution y = g(x) and b = g(a) and use change of variables in the limit to obtain

The Chain Rule Using Leibniz's Notation

As with other derivatives that we have seen, we can express the chain rule using Leibniz's notation. This notation
for the chain rule is used heavily in physics applications.

For h (x) = f (g (x)), let u = g(x) and y = h (x) = f (u). Thus,
Equation:

                        dy                                    dy                           du
                               , f (g (x)) = f (u) =          du                                  .
               h (x) =                                                and g (x) =
                        dx                                                                 dx

Consequently,
Equation:

               dy    dy du

                        = h (x) = f (g (x))g (x) =                           .

               dx                                                     du dx

Key Concepts

The chain rule allows us to differentiate compositions of two or more functions. It states that for

h (x) = f (g (x)),

Equation:

                                                                                  
                                            h (x) = f (g (x))g (x).

In Leibniz's notation this rule takes the form
Equation:

                                                            dy         dy du

                                                                  =                 .

                                                            dx         du dx

We can use the chain rule with other rules that we have learned, and we can derive formulas for some of
them.
The chain rule combines with the power rule to form a new rule:
Equation:

                                                            n                                 n-1 

                                    If h (x) = (g (x)) , then h (x) = n(g (x))                      g (x).

When applied to the composition of three functions, the chain rule can be expressed as follows: If
h (x) = f (g (k (x))), then h (x) = f (g (k (x))g (k (x))k (x).

Implicit Differentiation

      Find the derivative of a complicated function by using implicit differentiation.
      Use implicit differentiation to determine the equation of a tangent line.

We have already studied how to find equations of tangent lines to functions and the rate of change of a function at
a specific point. In all these cases we had the explicit equation for the function and differentiated these functions
explicitly. Suppose instead that we want to determine the equation of a tangent line to an arbitrary curve or the rate
of change of an arbitrary curve at a point. In this section, we solve these problems by finding the derivatives of
functions that define y implicitly in terms of x.

Implicit Differentiation

In most discussions of math, if the dependent variable y is a function of the independent variable x, we express y

in terms of x. If this is the case, we say that y is an explicit function of x. For example, when we write the

equation y = x2 + 1, we are defining y explicitly in terms of x. On the other hand, if the relationship between the

function y and the variable x is expressed by an equation where y is not expressed entirely in terms of x, we say

that  the  equation  defines  y  implicitly  in  terms  of  x.  For     example,  the  equation  y  -      2  =  1  defines  the  function

                                                                                                       x

y = x2 + 1 implicitly.

Implicit differentiation allows us to find slopes of tangents to curves that are clearly not functions (they fail the
vertical line test). We are using the idea that portions of y are functions that satisfy the given equation, but that y is
not actually a function of x.

In general, an equation defines a function implicitly if the function satisfies that equation. An equation may define
many different functions implicitly. For example, the functions

y = 25 - x2 and y = {            25 - x2 if - 5 < x < 0              , which are illustrated in [link], are just three of the many

                                 -25 - x2 if 0 < x < 25

functions  defined   implicitly  by  the  equation      2  +      2  =  25.

                                                    x         y
                  The equation x2 + y2 = 25 defines many functions implicitly.

If  we  want  to  find  the  slope  of  the  line  tangent  to  the  graph  of      2  +      2  =  25  at  the  point  (3,  4),  we  could  evaluate

                                                                                x         y

the derivative of the function y = 25 - x2 at x = 3. On the other hand, if we want the slope of the tangent line

at the point (3, -4), we could use the derivative of y = -25 - x2. However, it is not always easy to solve for a

function defined implicitly by an equation. Fortunately, the technique of implicit differentiation allows us to find
the derivative of an implicitly defined function without ever solving for the function explicitly. The process of

                            dy

finding dx using implicit differentiation is described in the following problem-solving strategy.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Implicit Differentiation
To perform implicit differentiation on an equation that defines a function y implicitly in terms of a variable x, use
the following steps:
1. Take the derivative of both sides of the equation. Keep in mind that y is a function of x. Consequently,

whereas d (sin x) = cos x, d (sin y) = cos y dy because we must use the chain rule to differentiate sin y
           dx                                       dx                 dx

with respect to x.

                                                                         dy                                                  dy
2. Rewrite the equation so that all terms containing dx are on the left and all terms that do not contain dx are

on the right.

                                              dy

3. Factor out dx on the left.

                                          dy

4. Solve for dx by dividing both sides of the equation by an appropriate algebraic expression.

Analysis

recalling that x2        2  = 25 and making this substitution in the numerator to obtain                                      d2y         25

Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

      Find the derivative of exponential functions.
      Find the derivative of logarithmic functions.
      Use logarithmic differentiation to determine the derivative of a function.

So far, we have learned how to differentiate a variety of functions, including trigonometric, inverse, and implicit
functions. In this section, we explore derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions. As we discussed in
Introduction to Functions and Graphs, exponential functions play an important role in modeling population growth
and the decay of radioactive materials. Logarithmic functions can help rescale large quantities and are particularly
helpful for rewriting complicated expressions.

Derivative of the Exponential Function

Just as when we found the derivatives of other functions, we can find the derivatives of exponential and
logarithmic functions using formulas. As we develop these formulas, we need to make certain basic assumptions.
The proofs that these assumptions hold are beyond the scope of this course.

First  of  all,  we  begin    with   the    assumption         that  the  function  B      (x)        =      x  b  >  0,  is  defined  for  every     real  number

                                                                                                          b,

and is continuous. In previous courses, the values of exponential functions for all rational numbers were defined--

beginning with the definition of bn, where n is a positive integer--as the product of b multiplied by itself n times.

Later,  we  defined        0            -n       1     for  a  positive   integer          and           s/t       t  s    for  positive   integers      and      These
                                                bn                                                                 (b)
                        b     =  1,  b      =       ,                               n,                b       =                                       s       t.

definitions      leave  open  the    question       of  the  value   of      r  where   r  is         an  arbitrary   real  number.    By   assuming     the

                                                                          b

continuity   of  B   (x)  =      x   b  >   0,  we     may   interpret       r  as                 x  where   the  values   of  x  as  we  take  the  limit  are

                              b,                                          b         lim b

                                                                                    xr

rational. For example, we may view 4 as the number satisfying

Equation:

                                            43 < 4 < 44, 43.1 < 4 < 43.2, 43.14 < 4 < 43.15,

Approximating a Value of 4
We  also     assume       that  for  B       (x)  =     x   b  >        0,  the  value          (0)  of  the  derivative   exists.  In  this  section,      we  show    that

                                                     b,                                 B

by making this one additional assumption, it is possible to prove that the function B (x) is differentiable

everywhere.

We make one final assumption: that there is a unique value of b > 0 for which B (0) = 1. We define e to be this

unique value, as we did in Introduction to Functions and Graphs. [link] provides graphs of the functions

y  =      x  y  =      x  y  =            x  and  y  =               x  A   visual  estimate    of   the    slopes  of  the   tangent   lines  to  these    functions   at   0

      2,           3,           2.7 ,                      2.8 .

provides     evidence        that  the       value   of  e  lies        somewhere   between          2.7    and  2.8.  The    function  E  (x)     =     x  is  called  the

                                                                                                                                                      e

natural exponential function. Its inverse, L (x) = logex = ln x is called the natural logarithmic function.

                          The graph of E (x) = ex is between y = 2x and y = 3x.

For a better estimate of e, we may construct a table of estimates of B (0) for functions of the form B (x) = bx.
Before doing this, recall that
Equation:

                                                                                 x      0                x              x

                                                     B (0) = lim                           = lim                 

                                                                        x0 x - 0                x0          x              x

Estimating a Value of e

The evidence from the table suggests that 2.7182 < e < 2.7183.

The  graph  of  E  (x)  =       x  together  with         the  line  y  =  x   +   1  are  shown  in  [link].              This  line  is  tangent  to  the    graph  of

                             e

E (x) = ex at x = 0.

     The  tangent  line  to  E     (x)  =       x  at  x  =    0  has   slope  1.

Now that we have laid out our basic assumptions, we begin our investigation by exploring the derivative of
B (x) = bx, b > 0. Recall that we have assumed that B (0) exists. By applying the limit definition to the
derivative we conclude that

We see that on the basis of the assumption that B (x) = bx is differentiable at 0, B (x) is not only differentiable
everywhere, but its derivative is
Equation:

                                                                                                x

For E (x) = ex, E (0) = 1. Thus, we have E (x) = ex. (The value of B (0) for an arbitrary function of the form

Proof

If  x  >   0  and  y  =  ln x,                then     y  =  x.  Differentiating  both  sides  of     this     equation  results  in  the  equation

                                         dy

Solving for dx yields
Equation:

                                                dy       1

                                                dx ey

Finally, we substitute x = ey to obtain
Equation:

                                                dy       1

                                                      =     .

                                                dx       x

We may also derive this result by applying the inverse function theorem, as follows. Since y = g(x) = ln x is the
inverse of f (x) = ex, by applying the inverse function theorem we have
Equation:

                                         dy     1              1               1

                                             =           =        =               .

                                         dx f  (g (x)) eln x x

Using this result and applying the chain rule to h (x) = ln (g (x)) yields
Equation:

Proof

If y = logbx, then by = x. It follows that ln (by) = ln x. Thus y ln b = ln x. Solving for y, we have y = lnb lnx .
Differentiating and keeping in mind that ln b is a constant, we see that
Equation:

                                                                 dy            1

The derivative in [link] now follows from the chain rule.

If  y  =     x  then     ln  y  =  x ln b.  Using  implicit  differentiation,  again    keeping             in  mind  that  ln b  is  constant,  it  follows

          b,

that y dx 1 = ln b. dy Solving for dx dy and substituting y = bx, we see that

At this point, we can take derivatives of functions of the form y = (g (x))n for certain values of n, as well as

functions  of  the  form  y  =  bg(x) ,  where               b  >   0  and  b    1.  Unfortunately,  we  still  do  not  know  the  derivatives  of

functions such as y = xx or y = x. These functions require a technique called logarithmic differentiation,

which allows us to differentiate any function of the form h (x) = g(x) . f(x) It can also be used to convert a very

Key Concepts

  On the basis of the assumption that the exponential function y = bx, b > 0 is continuous everywhere and

  differentiable at 0, this function is differentiable everywhere and there is a formula for its derivative.

  We can use a formula to find the derivative of y = ln x, and the relationship logbx =  ln x  allows us to extend
                                                                                         ln b

  our differentiation formulas to include logarithms with arbitrary bases.

  Logarithmic differentiation allows us to differentiate functions of the form y = g(x)f(x) or very complex

  functions by taking the natural logarithm of both sides and exploiting the properties of logarithms before

  differentiating.

Related Rates

      Express changing quantities in terms of derivatives.
      Find relationships among the derivatives in a given problem.
      Use the chain rule to find the rate of change of one quantity that
      depends on the rate of change of other quantities.

We have seen that for quantities that are changing over time, the rates at
which these quantities change are given by derivatives. If two related
quantities are changing over time, the rates at which the quantities change
are related. For example, if a balloon is being filled with air, both the radius
of the balloon and the volume of the balloon are increasing. In this section,
we consider several problems in which two or more related quantities are
changing and we study how to determine the relationship between the rates
of change of these quantities.

Setting up Related-Rates Problems

In many real-world applications, related quantities are changing with

respect to time. For example, if we consider the balloon example again, we

can say that the rate of change in the volume, V , is related to the rate of

change in the radius, r. In this case, we say that     dV   and    dr  are related
                                                        dt         dt

rates because V is related to r. Here we study several examples of related

quantities that are changing with respect to time and we look at how to

calculate one rate of change given another rate of change.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Inflating a Balloon

A spherical balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of

2            3  ([link]).  How  fast  is  the  radius  increasing  when  the  radius

   cm /sec

is 3 cm?
As the balloon is being filled with air, both the radius and the
          volume are increasing with respect to time.

Solution:

The volume of a sphere of radius r centimeters is
Equation:

                                                                             433
                                                              V = r cm .

                                                                             3

Since the balloon is being filled with air, both the volume and the
radius are functions of time. Therefore, t seconds after beginning to
fill the balloon with air, the volume of air in the balloon is
Equation:

         4  3  3

V (t) =     [r(t)] cm .

         3

Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time and
applying the chain rule, we see that the rate of change in the volume is
related to the rate of change in the radius by the equation
Equation:

                                                                                                                                      2

                                                     V (t) = 4[r (t)] r (t).
The balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm3/sec,
so V (t) = 2 cm3/sec. Therefore,
Equation:

               3           2  2

           2cm /sec = (4[r(t)] cm )  (r(t)cm/s),

which implies
Equation:

                  r(t) =            1

                                                   cm/sec.

                                                       2

                           2[r (t)]

When the radius r = 3 cm,
Equation:

                  r(t) =      1
                                      cm/sec.

Before looking at other examples, let's outline the problem-solving strategy
we will be using to solve related-rates problems.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving a Related-Rates Problem

   1. Assign symbols to all variables involved in the problem. Draw a
      figure if applicable.

   2. State, in terms of the variables, the information that is given and the
      rate to be determined.

   3. Find an equation relating the variables introduced in step 1.
   4. Using the chain rule, differentiate both sides of the equation found in

      step 3 with respect to the independent variable. This new equation
      will relate the derivatives.
   5. Substitute all known values into the equation from step 4, then solve
      for the unknown rate of change.

Note that when solving a related-rates problem, it is crucial not to substitute
known values too soon. For example, if the value for a changing quantity is
substituted into an equation before both sides of the equation are
differentiated, then that quantity will behave as a constant and its derivative
will not appear in the new equation found in step 4. We examine this
potential error in the following example.

Examples of the Process

Let's now implement the strategy just described to solve several related-
rates problems. The first example involves a plane flying overhead. The
relationship we are studying is between the speed of the plane and the rate
at which the distance between the plane and a person on the ground is
changing.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   An Airplane Flying at a Constant Elevation
   An airplane is flying overhead at a constant elevation of 4000 ft. A
   man is viewing the plane from a position 3000 ft from the base of a
   radio tower. The airplane is flying horizontally away from the man. If
   the plane is flying at the rate of 600 ft/sec, at what rate is the
   distance between the man and the plane increasing when the plane
   passes over the radio tower?
   Solution:
   Step 1. Draw a picture, introducing variables to represent the different
   quantities involved.

      An airplane is flying at a constant height of 4000 ft. The distance
between the person and the airplane and the person and the place
   on the ground directly below the airplane are changing. We

denote those quantities with the variables s and x, respectively.

As shown, x denotes the distance between the man and the position
on the ground directly below the airplane. The variable s denotes the
distance between the man and the plane. Note that both x and s are
functions of time. We do not introduce a variable for the height of the
plane because it remains at a constant elevation of 4000 ft. Since an
object's height above the ground is measured as the shortest distance
between the object and the ground, the line segment of length 4000 ft
is perpendicular to the line segment of length x feet, creating a right
triangle.

Step 2. Since x denotes the horizontal distance between the man and

the point on the ground below the plane, dx/dt represents the speed

of the plane. We are told the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec.

Therefore,  dx  = 600 ft/sec. Since we are asked to find the rate of
            dt

change in the distance between the man and the plane when the plane

is directly above the radio tower, we need to find ds/dt when

x = 3000 f t.

Step 3. From the figure, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write
an equation relating x and s:
Equation:

                2        2          2

                [x (t)] + 4000 = [s (t)] .

Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time and using the
fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we arrive at the equation
Equation:

                    dx       ds
                x
                         =s      .
                     dt
                             dt
Step 5. Find the rate at which the distance between the man and the

plane is increasing when the plane is directly over the radio tower.

That is, find dt ds when x = 3000 ft. Since the speed of the plane is

600 ft/sec, we know that dt = 600 ft/sec. dx We are not given an

explicit value for s; however, since we are trying to find  ds  when
                                                            dt

x = 3000 ft, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the

distance s when x = 3000 and the height is 4000 ft. Solving the

equation

Equation:

                      2          2  2

                   3000 + 4000 = s

for s, we have s = 5000 ft at the time of interest. Using these values,
we conclude that ds/dt is a solution of the equation
Equation:

            (3000)(600) = (5000)       ds
                                              .

                                       dt

Therefore,
Equation:

            ds     3000  600

                =                = 360 f t/sec.

            dt     5000

Note: When solving related-rates problems, it is important not to
substitute values for the variables too soon. For example, in step 3, we
related the variable quantities x (t) and s (t) by the equation
Equation:

                   2          2        2

                [x (t)] + 4000 = [s (t)] .

Since the plane remains at a constant height, it is not necessary to
introduce a variable for the height, and we are allowed to use the
constant 4000 to denote that quantity. However, the other two
quantities are changing. If we mistakenly substituted x(t) = 3000
into the equation before differentiating, our equation would have been
Equation:

2  2                 2

3000 + 4000 = [s (t)] .

After differentiating, our equation would become
Equation:

              ds

   0 = s (t)      .

              dt

As a result, we would incorrectly conclude that  ds  = 0.
                                                 dt

   A rocket is launched so that it rises vertically. A camera is positioned
   5000 ft from the launch pad. When the rocket is 1000 ft above the
   launch pad, its velocity is 600 ft/sec. Find the necessary rate of
   change of the camera's angle as a function of time so that it stays
   focused on the rocket.
   Solution:
   Step 1. Draw a picture introducing the variables.
A camera is positioned 5000 ft from the launch pad of the rocket.
     The height of the rocket and the angle of the camera are

 changing with respect to time. We denote those quantities with
                  the variables h and , respectively.

Let h denote the height of the rocket above the launch pad and  be
the angle between the camera lens and the ground.

Step 2. We are trying to find the rate of change in the angle of the

camera with respect to time when the rocket is 1000 ft off the ground.

That is, we need to find  d   when h = 1000 ft. At that time, we know
                          dt

the velocity of the rocket is dt dh = 600 ft/sec.

Step 3. Now we need to find an equation relating the two quantities
that are changing with respect to time: h and . How can we create
such an equation? Using the fact that we have drawn a right triangle,
it is natural to think about trigonometric functions. Recall that tan  is
the ratio of the length of the opposite side of the triangle to the length
of the adjacent side. Thus, we have
Equation:

                 tan  =      h
                                      .

                         5000

This gives us the equation
Equation:

                                                               h = 5000 tan .

Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time t, we obtain
Equation:

             dh          2    d
             dt
                 = 5000 sec                                                    .

                              dt

Step 5. We want to find dt d when h = 1000 ft. At this time, we know
that dt dh = 600 ft/sec. We need to determine sec2. Recall that sec 
is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the
adjacent side. We know the length of the adjacent side is 5000 ft. To
determine the length of the hypotenuse, we use the Pythagorean
theorem, where the length of one leg is 5000 ft, the length of the
other leg is h = 1000 ft, and the length of the hypotenuse is c feet as
shown in the following figure.

We see that
Equation:
                          2        2                                          2
                      1000 + 5000 = c

and we conclude that the hypotenuse is
Equation:

                                                             c = 100026 f t.

Therefore, when h = 1000, we have
Equation:

                                       2

                   2       100026                                                      26
                                                                                              .
               sec  = (               )=
                                                                                       25
                             5000

Recall from step 4 that the equation relating                                 d        to our known values
                                                                              dt

is

Equation:

                      dh           2 d
                      dt
                          = 5000 sec                                             .

                                       dt

When h = 1000 f t, we know that dh = 600 f t/sec and sec2 = 26 .
                             dt                                                                  25

Substituting these values into the previous equation, we arrive at the

equation

Equation:

                                   26 d

                   600 = 5000 (       )                                             .

                                   25 dt

Therefore, d = 3 rad/sec.

In the next example, we consider water draining from a cone-shaped funnel.
We compare the rate at which the level of water in the cone is decreasing
with the rate at which the volume of water is decreasing.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Water Draining from a Funnel

Water is draining from the bottom of a cone-shaped funnel at the rate

of 0.03 ft /sec. 3 The height of the funnel is 2 ft and the radius at the

top of the funnel is 1 ft. At what rate is the height of the water in the

funnel changing when the height of the water is  1  f t?
                                                 2

Solution:
Step 1: Draw a picture introducing the variables.

       Water is draining from a funnel of height 2 ft and
     radius 1 ft. The height of the water and the radius of

        water are changing over time. We denote these
      quantities with the variables h and r, respectively.
Let h denote the height of the water in the funnel, r denote the radius
of the water at its surface, and V denote the volume of the water.
Step 2: We need to determine dt dh when h = 2 ft. 1 We know that

 dV

         = -0.03 f t/sec.

  dt

Step 3: The volume of water in the cone is
Equation:
                                                   12
                                     V = r h.

                                                   3

From the figure, we see that we have similar triangles. Therefore, the

ratio of the sides in the two triangles is the same. Therefore,                  r  =  1
                                                                                 h     2

or r =  h  .  Using  this  fact,  the  equation        for    volume    can  be  simplified
        2

to

Equation:

                                             2

                                  1    h                      3
                                                                    h.
                     V = ( ) h =

                                  3    2                      12

Step 4: Applying the chain rule while differentiating both sides of this
equation with respect to time t, we obtain
Equation:

                                  dV       2 dh
                                   dt
                                       =     h                .

                                          4            dt

Step 5: We want to find    dh     when h =             1   ft. Since water is leaving at
                           dt                          2

the rate of 0.03 ft /sec, 3 we know that               dV                    3

                                                       dt     = -0.03 f t /sec.

Therefore,
Equation:

                                                           2

                                          1                   dh

                           -0.03 =        ()                        ,

                                          42                  dt

which implies
Equation:

                                                          dh
                           -0.03 =                               .

                                                   16     dt
It follows that
Equation:

                 dh              0.48  = -0.153 f t/sec.
                 dt  =-

                                    

Note:

   Problem:

   At what rate is the height of the water changing when the height of the
   water is 4 1 ft?

   Solution:

      -0.61 f t/sec

      Define local extrema.
      Explain how to find the critical points of a function over a closed
      interval.
      Describe how to use critical points to locate absolute extrema over a
      closed interval.

Given a particular function, we are often interested in determining the
largest and smallest values of the function. This information is important in
creating accurate graphs. Finding the maximum and minimum values of a
function also has practical significance because we can use this method to
solve optimization problems, such as maximizing profit, minimizing the
amount of material used in manufacturing an aluminum can, or finding the
maximum height a rocket can reach. In this section, we look at how to use
derivatives to find the largest and smallest values for a function.

Absolute Extrema

Consider the function f(x) = x2 + 1 over the interval (-, ). As

x  ±, f(x)  . Therefore, the function does not have a largest

value.  However,     since         2  +  1    1  for  all  real  numbers  x  and      2  +  1  =  1

                               x                                                  x

when x = 0, the function has a smallest value, 1, when x = 0. We say that

1 is the absolute minimum of f(x) = x2 + 1 and it occurs at x = 0. We

say  that  f (x)  =      2  +  1  does   not  have    an   absolute  maximum      (see   the

                     x

following figure).
     The given function has an absolute minimum of 1 at
        x = 0. The function does not have an absolute
                              maximum.

Note:
Definition
Let f be a function defined over an interval I and let c  I. We say f has
an absolute maximum on I at c if f(c)  f(x) for all x  I. We say f
has an absolute minimum on I at c if f(c)  f(x) for all x  I. If f has
an absolute maximum on I at c or an absolute minimum on I at c, we say
f has an absolute extremum on I at c.

Before proceeding, let's note two important issues regarding this definition.
First, the term absolute here does not refer to absolute value. An absolute
extremum may be positive, negative, or zero. Second, if a function f has an
absolute extremum over an interval I at c, the absolute extremum is f(c).
The real number c is a point in the domain at which the absolute extremum
occurs. For example, consider the function f(x) = 1/(x2 + 1) over the
interval (-, ). Since
Equation:

f (0) = 1         1  = f (x)
            x2 + 1

for all real numbers x, we say f has an absolute maximum over (-, )
at x = 0. The absolute maximum is f(0) = 1. It occurs at x = 0, as shown
in [link](b).

A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum,
just one extremum, or neither. [link] shows several functions and some of
the different possibilities regarding absolute extrema. However, the
following theorem, called the Extreme Value Theorem, guarantees that a
continuous function f over a closed, bounded interval [a, b] has both an
absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.
   Graphs (a), (b), and (c) show several possibilities for absolute extrema
     for functions with a domain of (-, ). Graphs (d), (e), and (f)
     show several possibilities for absolute extrema for functions with a
                         domain that is a bounded interval.

Note:
Extreme Value Theorem
If f is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [a, b], then
there is a point in [a, b] at which f has an absolute maximum over [a, b]
and there is a point in [a, b] at which f has an absolute minimum over

[a, b].

The proof of the extreme value theorem is beyond the scope of this text.
Typically, it is proved in a course on real analysis. There are a couple of key
points to note about the statement of this theorem. For the extreme value
theorem to apply, the function must be continuous over a closed, bounded
interval. If the interval I is open or the function has even one point of
discontinuity, the function may not have an absolute maximum or absolute
minimum over I. For example, consider the functions shown in [link](d),
(e), and (f). All three of these functions are defined over bounded intervals.
However, the function in graph (e) is the only one that has both an absolute
maximum and an absolute minimum over its domain. The extreme value
theorem cannot be applied to the functions in graphs (d) and (f) because
neither of these functions is continuous over a closed, bounded interval.
Although the function in graph (d) is defined over the closed interval [0, 4],
the function is discontinuous at x = 2. The function has an absolute
maximum over [0, 4] but does not have an absolute minimum. The function
in graph (f) is continuous over the half-open interval [0, 2), but is not
defined at x = 2, and therefore is not continuous over a closed, bounded
interval. The function has an absolute minimum over [0, 2), but does not
have an absolute maximum over [0, 2). These two graphs illustrate why a
function over a bounded interval may fail to have an absolute maximum
and/or absolute minimum.

Before looking at how to find absolute extrema, let's examine the related
concept of local extrema. This idea is useful in determining where absolute
extrema occur.

Local Extrema and Critical Points
Consider the function f shown in [link]. The graph can be described as two
mountains with a valley in the middle. The absolute maximum value of the
function occurs at the higher peak, at x = 2. However, x = 0 is also a point
of interest. Although f (0) is not the largest value of f, the value f (0) is
larger than f (x) for all x near 0. We say f has a local maximum at x = 0.
Similarly, the function f does not have an absolute minimum, but it does
have a local minimum at x = 1 because f (1) is less than f (x) for x near
1.

        This function f has two local
   maxima and one local minimum. The
    local maximum at x = 2 is also the

             absolute maximum.
Note:
Definition
A function f has a local maximum at c if there exists an open interval I
containing c such that I is contained in the domain of f and f(c)  f(x)
for all x  I. A function f has a local minimum at c if there exists an
open interval I containing c such that I is contained in the domain of f and
f(c)  f(x) for all x  I. A function f has a local extremum at c if f
has a local maximum at c or f has a local minimum at c.

Note that if f has an absolute extremum at c and f is defined over an
interval containing c, then f(c) is also considered a local extremum. If an
absolute extremum for a function f occurs at an endpoint, we do not
consider that to be a local extremum, but instead refer to that as an endpoint
extremum.

Given the graph of a function f, it is sometimes easy to see where a local
maximum or local minimum occurs. However, it is not always easy to see,
since the interesting features on the graph of a function may not be visible
because they occur at a very small scale. Also, we may not have a graph of
the function. In these cases, how can we use a formula for a function to
determine where these extrema occur?

To answer this question, let's look at [link] again. The local extrema occur
at x = 0, x = 1, and x = 2. Notice that at x = 0 and x = 1, the derivative
f(x) = 0. At x = 2, the derivative f(x) does not exist, since the function
f has a corner there. In fact, if f has a local extremum at a point x = c, the
derivative f(c) must satisfy one of the following conditions: either
f(c) = 0 or f(c) is undefined. Such a value c is known as a critical point
and it is important in finding extreme values for functions.

Note:
Definition
Let c be an interior point in the domain of f. We say that c is a critical
point of f if f(c) = 0 or f(c) is undefined.

As mentioned earlier, if f has a local extremum at a point x = c, then c
must be a critical point of f. This fact is known as Fermat's theorem.

Note:
Fermat's Theorem
If f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c, then f(c) = 0.

Proof

Suppose f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c. We need to
show that f(c) = 0. To do this, we will show that f(c)  0 and
f(c)  0, and therefore f(c) = 0. Since f has a local extremum at c, f
has a local maximum or local minimum at c. Suppose f has a local
maximum at c. The case in which f has a local minimum at c can be
handled similarly. There then exists an open interval I such that
f (c)  f (x) for all x  I. Since f is differentiable at c, from the
definition of the derivative, we know that
Equation:

             f (x) - f (c)

f (c) = lim                 .

xc           x-c

Since this limit exists, both one-sided limits also exist and equal f(c).
Therefore,
Equation:

             f (x) - f (c)

f (c) = lim                 ,

xc+          x-c
and
Equation:

                        f (x) - f (c)

           f (c) = lim                 .

           xc-          x-c

Since f(c) is a local maximum, we see that f(x) - f(c)  0 for x near c.

                                                                                                                                                   f (x)-f (c)

Therefore, for x near c, but x > c, we have x-c  0. From [link] we
conclude that f(c)  0. Similarly, it can be shown that f(c)  0.
Therefore, f(c) = 0.



From Fermat's theorem, we conclude that if f has a local extremum at c,
then either f(c) = 0 or f(c) is undefined. In other words, local extrema
can only occur at critical points.

Note this theorem does not claim that a function f must have a local
extremum at a critical point. Rather, it states that critical points are
candidates for local extrema. For example, consider the function
f (x) = x3. We have f(x) = 3x2 = 0 when x = 0. Therefore, x = 0 is a
critical point. However, f(x) = x3 is increasing over (-, ), and thus f
does not have a local extremum at x = 0. In [link], we see several different
possibilities for critical points. In some of these cases, the functions have
local extrema at critical points, whereas in other cases the functions do not.
Note that these graphs do not show all possibilities for the behavior of a
function at a critical point.
      (a-e) A function f has a critical point at c if f(c) = 0 or f(c) is
      undefined. A function may or may not have a local extremum at a

                                      critical point.

Later in this chapter we look at analytical methods for determining whether
a function actually has a local extremum at a critical point. For now, let's
turn our attention to finding critical points. We will use graphical
observations to determine whether a critical point is associated with a local
extremum.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Locating Critical Points
For each of the following functions, find all critical points. Use a
graphing utility to determine whether the function has a local
extremum at each of the critical points.

a. f (x) = 1 x3 - 5 x2 + 4x
3                                          2

b. f (x) = (x2 - 1)3

c. f (x) = 2 4x
                                      1+x

Solution:

   a. The derivative f(x) = x2 - 5x + 4 is defined for all real
      numbers x. Therefore, we only need to find the values for x
      where f(x) = 0. Since
      f(x) = x2 - 5x + 4 = (x - 4) (x - 1), the critical points are
      x = 1 and x = 4. From the graph of f in [link], we see that f
      has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = 4.

      This function has a local maximum
              and a local minimum.

b. Using the chain rule, we see the derivative is
  Equation:
                                22                             22
                f (x) = 3(x - 1) (2x) = 6x(x - 1) .

Therefore, f has critical points when x = 0 and when

    2  -  1  =  0.       We  conclude  that  the  critical  points  are  x  =    0,  ±1.

x

From the graph of f in [link], we see that f has a local (and

absolute) minimum at x = 0, but does not have a local

extremum at x = 1 or x = -1.

       This function has three critical points: x = 0, x = 1,
       and x = -1. The function has a local (and absolute)
       minimum at x = 0, but does not have extrema at the

                        other two critical points.

c. By the chain rule, we see that the derivative is
  Equation:

                                                    2          4 - 4x2

                             (1 + x )(4) - 4x (2x)

             f (x) =                                        =                  .

                                (1 + x2 2 )                    (1 + x2 2 )

The derivative is defined everywhere. Therefore, we only need to

find values for x where f(x) = 0. Solving f(x) = 0, we see

that   4  -           2  =  0,  which  implies  x  =  ±1.   Therefore,      the   critical

             4x

points are x = ±1. From the graph of f in [link], we see that f
has an absolute maximum at x = 1 and an absolute minimum at
x = -1. Hence, f has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local
minimum at x = -1. (Note that if f has an absolute extremum
over an interval I at a point c that is not an endpoint of I, then f
has a local extremum at c. )

           This function has an absolute
            maximum and an absolute
                      minimum.

Locating Absolute Extrema

The extreme value theorem states that a continuous function over a closed,
bounded interval has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. As
shown in [link], one or both of these absolute extrema could occur at an
endpoint. If an absolute extremum does not occur at an endpoint, however,
it must occur at an interior point, in which case the absolute extremum is a
local extremum. Therefore, by [link], the point c at which the local
extremum occurs must be a critical point. We summarize this result in the
following theorem.

Note:
Location of Absolute Extrema
Let f be a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval I. The
absolute maximum of f over I and the absolute minimum of f over I must
occur at endpoints of I or at critical points of f in I.

With this idea in mind, let's examine a procedure for locating absolute
extrema.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Locating Absolute Extrema over a Closed
Interval
Consider a continuous function f defined over the closed interval [a, b].

   1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = a and x = b.
   2. Find all critical points of f that lie over the interval (a, b) and

      evaluate f at those critical points.
3. Compare all values found in (1) and (2). From [link], the absolute
  extrema must occur at endpoints or critical points. Therefore, the
  largest of these values is the absolute maximum of f. The smallest of
  these values is the absolute minimum of f.

Now let's look at how to use this strategy to find the absolute maximum and
absolute minimum values for continuous functions.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Locating Absolute Extrema

   For each of the following functions, find the absolute maximum and
   absolute minimum over the specified interval and state where those
   values occur.

      a. f(x) = -x2 + 3x - 2 over [1, 3].
      b. f (x) = x2 - 3x2/3 over [0, 2].

Solution:

   a. Step 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = 1 and x = 3.
      Equation:

                                                        f (1) = 0 and f (3) = -2

Step 2. Since f(x) = -2x + 3, f is defined for all real

numbers x. Therefore, there are no critical points where the

derivative is undefined. It remains to check where f(x) = 0.

Since f(x) = -2x + 3 = 0 at x = 3 and 3 is in the interval
2  2
[1,  3],  f  (  3  )  is  a  candidate      for  an  absolute                               extremum  of  f   over
                2

[1, 3]. We evaluate f ( 3 ) and find
                                                                            2

Equation:

                                                  3                               1
                                        f( ) =                                        .

From the table, we find that the absolute maximum of f over the

interval [1, 3] is           1  ,  and  it  occurs  at                         x  =      3  .  The  absolute

minimum of f over the interval [1, 3] is -2, and it occurs at

x = 3 as shown in the following graph.
This function has both an absolute maximum and an
                    absolute minimum.

b. Step 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = 0 and x = 2.
  Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                                       3

                               f (0) = 0 and f (2) = 4 - 34  -0.762

Step 2. The derivative of f is given by
Equation:

              2                          2x4/3  -2

f (x) = 2x -        =

              x1/3                           x1/3

for x  0. The derivative is zero when 2x4/3 - 2 = 0, which
implies x = ±1. The derivative is undefined at x = 0.
Therefore, the critical points of f are x = 0, 1, -1. The point
x = 0 is an endpoint, so we already evaluated f(0) in step 1.
The point x = -1 is not in the interval of interest, so we need
only evaluate f (1). We find that
Equation:
                                                             f (1) = -2.

Step 3. We compare the values found in steps 1 and 2, in the
following table.

x  f (x)   Conclusion
           Absolute maximum
0  0       Absolute minimum

1  -2

2  -0.762

We conclude that the absolute maximum of f over the interval
[0, 2] is zero, and it occurs at x = 0. The absolute minimum is
-2, and it occurs at x = 1 as shown in the following graph.
                 This function has an absolute
                maximum at an endpoint of the

                              interval.

   Solution:
   The absolute maximum is 3 and it occurs at x = 4. The absolute
   minimum is -1 and it occurs at x = 2.
Hint

Look for critical points. Evaluate f at all critical points and at the
endpoints.

At this point, we know how to locate absolute extrema for continuous
functions over closed intervals. We have also defined local extrema and
determined that if a function f has a local extremum at a point c, then c
must be a critical point of f. However, c being a critical point is not a
sufficient condition for f to have a local extremum at c. Later in this
chapter, we show how to determine whether a function actually has a local
extremum at a critical point. First, however, we need to introduce the Mean
Value Theorem, which will help as we analyze the behavior of the graph of
a function.

Key Concepts

      A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute
      minimum, have just one absolute extremum, or have no absolute
      maximum or absolute minimum.
      If a function has a local extremum, the point at which it occurs must be
      a critical point. However, a function need not have a local extremum at
      a critical point.
      A continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute
      maximum and an absolute minimum. Each extremum occurs at a
      critical point or an endpoint.

      graph.
      State the first derivative test for critical points.
      Use concavity and inflection points to explain how the sign of the second

      Explain the concavity test for a function over an open interval.
      Explain the relationship between a function and its first and second
      derivatives.
      State the second derivative test for local extrema.

Earlier in this chapter we stated that if a function f has a local extremum at a point

c, then c must be a critical point of f. However, a function is not guaranteed to

have  a  local  extremum  at  a  critical  point.  For  example,  f (x)  =      3  has  a  critical

                                                                            x

point at x = 0 since f(x) = 3x2 is zero at x = 0, but f does not have a local

extremum at x = 0. Using the results from the previous section, we are now able

to determine whether a critical point of a function actually corresponds to a local

extreme value. In this section, we also see how the second derivative provides

information about the shape of a graph by describing whether the graph of a

function curves upward or curves downward.

The First Derivative Test

Corollary 3 of the Mean Value Theorem showed that if the derivative of a function
is positive over an interval I then the function is increasing over I. On the other
hand, if the derivative of the function is negative over an interval I, then the
function is decreasing over I as shown in the following figure.
Both functions are increasing over the interval (a, b).
   At each point x, the derivative f(x) > 0. Both

 functions are decreasing over the interval (a, b). At
        each point x, the derivative f(x) < 0.

A continuous function f has a local maximum at point c if and only if f switches

from increasing to decreasing at point c. Similarly, f has a local minimum at c if

and only if f switches from decreasing to increasing at c. If f is a continuous

function over an interval I containing c and differentiable over I, except possibly

at c, the only way f can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at

point c is if f  changes sign as x increases through c. If f is differentiable at c, the

only  way  that  f      can  change  sign  as  x  increases  through  c  is  if  f    (c)  =  0.

                     .

Therefore, for a function f that is continuous over an interval I containing c and
differentiable over I, except possibly at c, the only way f can switch from

increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) is if f(c) = 0 or f  (c) is undefined.

Consequently, to locate local extrema for a function f, we look for points c in the

domain  of  f  such  that  f (c)  =  0  or         (c)  is  undefined.  Recall  that  such  points  are

                                            f

called critical points of f.

Note that f need not have a local extrema at a critical point. The critical points are
candidates for local extrema only. In [link], we show that if a continuous function
f has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point, but a function may not
have a local extremum at a critical point. We show that if f has a local extremum
at a critical point, then the sign of f  switches as x increases through that point.

     The function f has four critical points: a, b, c, and d. The function f has
    local maxima at a and d, and a local minimum at b. The function f does not

       have a local extremum at c. The sign of f changes at all local extrema.

Using [link], we summarize the main results regarding local extrema.
      If a continuous function f has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical
      point c.
      The function has a local extremum at the critical point c if and only if the
      derivative f  switches sign as x increases through c.
      Therefore, to test whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point
      c, we must determine the sign of f  (x) to the left and right of c.

This result is known as the first derivative test.

Note:
First Derivative Test
Suppose that f is a continuous function over an interval I containing a critical
point c. If f is differentiable over I, except possibly at point c, then f (c) satisfies
one of the following descriptions:

    i. If f  changes sign from positive when x < c to negative when x > c, then
      f (c) is a local maximum of f.

   ii. If f  changes sign from negative when x < c to positive when x > c, then
      f (c) is a local minimum of f.

  iii. If f has the same sign for x < c and x > c, then f (c) is neither a local
      maximum nor a local minimum of f.

We can summarize the first derivative test as a strategy for locating local extrema.

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Using the First Derivative Test
Consider a function f that is continuous over an interval I.

   1. Find all critical points of f and divide the interval I into smaller intervals
      using the critical points as endpoints.

   2. Analyze the sign of f in each of the subintervals. If f is continuous over a
      given subinterval (which is typically the case), then the sign of f in that
      subinterval does not change and, therefore, can be determined by choosing
      an arbitrary test point x in that subinterval and by evaluating the sign of f at
      that test point. Use the sign analysis to determine whether f is increasing or
      decreasing over that interval.
3. Use [link] and the results of step 2 to determine whether f has a local
  maximum, a local minimum, or neither at each of the critical points.

Now let's look at how to use this strategy to locate all local extrema for particular
functions.

Example:

f  (x)  =      3  -           2  -  9x  -  1.  Use  a  graphing  utility  to  confirm  your  results.

           x         3x

Solution:

Step 1. The derivative is f  (x) = 3x2 - 6x - 9. To find the critical points,
we need to find where f  (x) = 0. Factoring the polynomial, we conclude
that the critical points must satisfy
Equation:

                                 2

                     3(x - 2x - 3) = 3 (x - 3) (x + 1) = 0.

Therefore, the critical points are x = 3, -1. Now divide the interval
(-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, -1), (-1, 3) and (3, ).

Step 2. Since f is a continuous function, to determine the sign of f  (x) over
each subinterval, it suffices to choose a point over each of the intervals
(-, -1), (-1, 3) and (3, ) and determine the sign of f  at each of
these points. For example, let's choose x = -2, x = 0, and x = 4 as test
points.

(-1, 3)   x = -2                             increasing.
(3, )             f (x) = 3 (x - 3) (x + 1)
          x=0                                f is

                  (+) (-) (+) = -

                  (+) (+) (+) = +

Step 3. Since f  switches sign from positive to negative as x increases
through 1, f has a local maximum at x = -1. Since f  switches sign from
negative to positive as x increases through 3, f has a local minimum at
x = 3. These analytical results agree with the following graph.
The function f has a maximum at x = -1 and a
                 minimum at x = 3

f (x) = x                      -x         =            -            =              =                .

The derivative f  (x) = 0 when 1 - x4/3 = 0. Therefore, f  (x) = 0 at
x = ±1. The derivative f  (x) is undefined at x = 0. Therefore, we have
three critical points: x = 0, x = 1, and x = -1. Consequently, divide the
interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), and

(1, ).
Step 2: Since f  is continuous over each subinterval, it suffices to choose a
test point x in each of the intervals from step 1 and determine the sign of f 

at each of these points. The points x = -2, x = - 2 , x = 2 , and x = 2 1 1
are test points for these intervals.

Step 3: Since f is decreasing over the interval (-, -1) and increasing
over the interval (-1, 0), f has a local minimum at x = -1. Since f is
increasing over the interval (-1, 0) and the interval (0, 1), f does not have a
local extremum at x = 0. Since f is increasing over the interval (0, 1) and
decreasing over the interval (1, ), f has a local maximum at x = 1. The
analytical results agree with the following graph.
      The function f has a local minimum at
         x = -1 and a local maximum at

f  has  no  local  extrema    because          does  not   change  sign  at  x  =  1.

Hint

The only critical point of f is x = 1.

Concavity and Points of Inflection
We now know how to determine where a function is increasing or decreasing.
However, there is another issue to consider regarding the shape of the graph of a
function. If the graph curves, does it curve upward or curve downward? This
notion is called the concavity of the function.

[link](a) shows a function f with a graph that curves upward. As x increases, the
slope of the tangent line increases. Thus, since the derivative increases as x
increases, f  is an increasing function. We say this function f is concave up. [link]
(b) shows a function f that curves downward. As x increases, the slope of the
tangent line decreases. Since the derivative decreases as x increases, f  is a
decreasing function. We say this function f is concave down.

Note:

Definition

Let f be a function that is differentiable over an open interval I. If f  is

increasing  over  I,  we  say  f  is  concave  up  over  I.  If         is  decreasing  over  I,  we

                                                                 f

say f is concave down over I.
(a), (c) Since f is increasing over the interval (a, b), we say f is concave
up over (a, b). (b), (d) Since f is decreasing over the interval (a, b), we

                       say f is concave down over (a, b).

In general, without having the graph of a function f, how can we determine its

concavity?  By  definition,  a  function  f  is  concave  up  if         is  increasing.  From

                                                                  f

Corollary 3, we know that if f  is a differentiable function, then f  is increasing if

its derivative f (x) > 0. Therefore, a function f that is twice differentiable is
concave  up  when  f   (x)  >  0.  Similarly,  a  function  f  is  concave  down  if         is

                                                                                      f

decreasing. We know that a differentiable function f  is decreasing if its derivative

f (x) < 0. Therefore, a twice-differentiable function f is concave down when

f (x) < 0. Applying this logic is known as the concavity test.

Note:
Test for Concavity
Let f be a function that is twice differentiable over an interval I.

   i. If f (x) > 0 for all x  I, then f is concave up over I.
  ii. If f (x) < 0 for all x  I, then f is concave down over I.

We conclude that we can determine the concavity of a function f by looking at the
second derivative of f. In addition, we observe that a function f can switch
concavity ([link]). However, a continuous function can switch concavity only at a
point x if f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. Consequently, to determine the
intervals where a function f is concave up and concave down, we look for those
values of x where f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. When we have determined
these points, we divide the domain of f into smaller intervals and determine the
sign of f over each of these smaller intervals. If f changes sign as we pass
through a point x, then f changes concavity. It is important to remember that a
function f may not change concavity at a point x even if f (x) = 0 or f (x) is
undefined. If, however, f does change concavity at a point a and f is continuous
at a, we say the point (a, f (a)) is an inflection point of f.

Note:
Definition
If f is continuous at a and f changes concavity at a, the point (a, f (a)) is an
inflection point of f.
    Since f (x) > 0 for x < a, the function f is concave up over the interval
   (-, a). Since f (x) < 0 for x > a, the function f is concave down over

         the interval (a, ). The point (a, f (a)) is an inflection point of f.

   Testing for Concavity

   For the function f (x) = x3 - 6x2 + 9x + 30, determine all intervals where
   f is concave up and all intervals where f is concave down. List all inflection
   points for f. Use a graphing utility to confirm your results.

   Solution:

   To determine concavity, we need to find the second derivative f (x). The
   first derivative is f(x) = 3x2 - 12x + 9, so the second derivative is
   f (x) = 6x - 12. If the function changes concavity, it occurs either when
   f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. Since f is defined for all real numbers
x, we need only find where f (x) = 0. Solving the equation 6x - 12 = 0,
we see that x = 2 is the only place where f could change concavity. We now
test points over the intervals (-, 2) and (2, ) to determine the concavity
of f. The points x = 0 and x = 3 are test points for these intervals.

We conclude that f is concave down over the interval (-, 2) and concave
up over the interval (2, ). Since f changes concavity at x = 2, the point
(2, f (2)) = (2, 32) is an inflection point. [link] confirms the analytical
results.

What Derivatives Tell Us about Graphs
     Consider a twice-differentiable function f over an open interval I. If
f(x) > 0 for all x  I, the function is increasing over I. If f(x) < 0 for all

   x  I, the function is decreasing over I. If f (x) > 0 for all x  I, the
 function is concave up. If f (x) < 0 for all x  I, the function is concave

                                        down on I.

The Second Derivative Test

The first derivative test provides an analytical tool for finding local extrema, but
the second derivative can also be used to locate extreme values. Using the second
derivative can sometimes be a simpler method than using the first derivative.

We know that if a continuous function has a local extrema, it must occur at a

critical point. However, a function need not have a local extrema at a critical point.

Here we examine how the second derivative test can be used to determine

whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point. Let f be a twice-

differentiable function such that f  (a) = 0 and f is continuous over an open

interval I containing a. Suppose f (a) < 0. Since f is continuous over I,

f   (x)  <  0  for  all  x    I  ([link]).  Then,  by  Corollary  3,         is  a  decreasing  function

                                                                      f

over I. Since f  (a) = 0, we conclude that for all x  I, f  (x) > 0 if x < a and

f  (x) < 0 if x > a. Therefore, by the first derivative test, f has a local maximum

at x = a. On the other hand, suppose there exists a point b such that f  (b) = 0 but
f (b) > 0. Since f is continuous over an open interval I containing b, then

f (x) > 0 for all x  I ([link]). Then, by Corollary 3, f  is an increasing

function over I. Since f  (b) = 0, we conclude that for all x  I, f  (x) < 0 if

x  <  b  and         (x)  >  0  if  x  >  b.  Therefore,  by  the  first  derivative  test,  f  has  a  local

              f

minimum at x = b.

   Consider a twice-differentiable function f such that f
   is continuous. Since f(a) = 0 and f (a) < 0, there
   is an interval I containing a such that for all x in I, f
   is increasing if x < a and f is decreasing if x > a. As

       a result, f has a local maximum at x = a. Since
       f(b) = 0 and f (b) > 0, there is an interval I
   containing b such that for all x in I, f is decreasing if
   x < b and f is increasing if x > b. As a result, f has a

                     local minimum at x = b.

Note:
Second Derivative Test
Suppose f  (c) = 0, f is continuous over an interval containing c.

   i. If f (c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c.
   ii. If f (c) < 0, then f has a local maximum at c.
   iii. If f (c) = 0, then the test is inconclusive.

Note that for case iii. when f (c) = 0, then f may have a local maximum, local

minimum, or neither at c. For example, the functions f (x) = x3, f (x) = x4, and

f  (x)  =             4  all  have  critical  points           at  x  =  0.  In  each  case,  the  second   derivative

           -x

is zero at x = 0. However, the function f (x) = x4 has a local minimum at x = 0

whereas    the  function      f     (x)  =               4  has    a  local  maximum      at  x,  and  the  function

                                              -x

f (x) = x3 does not have a local extremum at x = 0.

Let's now look at how to use the second derivative test to determine whether f has
a local maximum or local minimum at a critical point c where f  (c) = 0.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Using the Second Derivative Test

   Use the second derivative to find the location of all local extrema for

     f (x) = x5 - 5x3.

   Solution:

   To apply the second derivative test, we first need to find critical points c
   where f  (c) = 0. The derivative is f  (x) = 5x4 - 15x2. Therefore,
   f  (x) = 5x4 - 15x2 = 5x2 (x2 - 3) = 0 when x = 0, ±3.

   To determine whether f has a local extrema at any of these points, we need
   to evaluate the sign of f at these points. The second derivative is
   Equation:

                                                            3                          2
                              f  (x) = 20x - 30x = 10x (2x - 3).
In the following table, we evaluate the second derivative at each of the
critical points and use the second derivative test to determine whether f has
a local maximum or local minimum at any of these points.

3                 303             Local minimum

By the second derivative test, we conclude that f has a local maximum at

x = -3 and f has a local minimum at x = 3. The second derivative test
is inconclusive at x = 0. To determine whether f has a local extrema at
x = 0, we apply the first derivative test. To evaluate the sign of

f  (x) = 5x2 (x2 - 3) for x  (-3, 0) and x  (0, 3), let x = -1

and  x  =  1  be  the  two  test  points.  Since         (-1)  <  0  and         (1)  <  0,  we

                                                  f                       f

conclude that f is decreasing on both intervals and, therefore, f does not

have a local extrema at x = 0 as shown in the following graph.
The function f has a local maximum at x = -3 and a local minimum
                                     at x = 3

   Solution:
   f has a local maximum at -2 and a local minimum at 3.
Hint

We have now developed the tools we need to determine where a function is
increasing and decreasing, as well as acquired an understanding of the basic shape
of the graph. In the next section we discuss what happens to a function as
x  ±. At that point, we have enough tools to provide accurate graphs of a
large variety of functions.

      If c is a critical point of f and f  (x) > 0 for x < c and f  (x) < 0 for x > c,
      then f has a local maximum at c.
      If c is a critical point of f and f  (x) < 0 for x < c and f  (x) > 0 for x > c,
      then f has a local minimum at c.
      If f (x) > 0 over an interval I, then f is concave up over I.
      If f (x) < 0 over an interval I, then f is concave down over I.
      If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c.
      If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) < 0, then f has a local maximum at c.
      If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) = 0, then evaluate f  (x) at a test point x to the left
      of c and a test point x to the right of c, to determine whether f has a local
      extremum at c.

Applied Optimization Problems

      Set up and solve optimization problems in several applied fields.

One common application of calculus is calculating the minimum or maximum
value of a function. For example, companies often want to minimize production
costs or maximize revenue. In manufacturing, it is often desirable to minimize
the amount of material used to package a product with a certain volume. In this
section, we show how to set up these types of minimization and maximization
problems and solve them by using the tools developed in this chapter.

Solving Optimization Problems over a Closed, Bounded Interval

The basic idea of the optimization problems that follow is the same. We have a
particular quantity that we are interested in maximizing or minimizing. However,
we also have some auxiliary condition that needs to be satisfied. For example, in
[link], we are interested in maximizing the area of a rectangular garden.
Certainly, if we keep making the side lengths of the garden larger, the area will
continue to become larger. However, what if we have some restriction on how
much fencing we can use for the perimeter? In this case, we cannot make the
garden as large as we like. Let's look at how we can maximize the area of a
rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.

Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Maximizing the Area of a Garden

   A rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of
   the garden and wire fencing for the other three sides ([link]). Given 100 ft
   of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a garden of
   maximum area. What is the maximum area?
     We want to determine the measurements x and y
   that will create a garden with a maximum area using

                        100 ft of fencing.

Solution:

Let x denote the length of the side of the garden perpendicular to the rock
wall and y denote the length of the side parallel to the rock wall. Then the
area of the garden is
Equation:

                                                                            A = x  y.

We want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that
the total fencing is 100 ft. From [link], the total amount of fencing used
will be 2x + y. Therefore, the constraint equation is
Equation:

                                                                      2x + y = 100.
Solving this equation for y, we have y = 100 - 2x. Thus, we can write the
area as
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                           2

                                        A (x) = x  (100 - 2x) = 100x - 2x .

Before  trying  to  maximize          the  area  function  A  (x)  =    100x     -           2  we  need

                                                                                    2x ,

to determine the domain under consideration. To construct a rectangular

garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive.

Therefore, we need x > 0 and y > 0. Since y = 100 - 2x, if y > 0, then

x < 50. Therefore, we are trying to determine the maximum value of A (x)

for x over the open interval (0, 50). We do not know that a function

necessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do

know that a continuous function has an absolute maximum (and absolute

minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let's consider the function

A  (x)  =  100x  -           2  over  the  closed  interval  [0,  50].  If  the  maximum

                    2x

value occurs at an interior point, then we have found the value x in the

open interval (0, 50) that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we

consider the following problem:

Maximize A (x) = 100x - 2x2 over the interval [0, 50].

As mentioned earlier, since A is a continuous function on a closed,
bounded interval, by the extreme value theorem, it has a maximum and a
minimum. These extreme values occur either at endpoints or critical points.
At the endpoints, A (x) = 0. Since the area is positive for all x in the open
interval (0, 50), the maximum must occur at a critical point. Differentiating
the function A (x), we obtain
Equation:

                                            

                                      A (x) = 100 - 4x.

Therefore, the only critical point is x = 25 ([link]). We conclude that the
maximum area must occur when x = 25. Then we have
y = 100 - 2x = 100 - 2 (25) = 50. To maximize the area of the garden,
let x = 25 ft and y = 50 ft. The area of this garden is 1250 ft . 2
    To maximize the area of the garden, we need to find the

           maximum  value     of  the  function  A  (x)  =  100x  -                 2

                                                                           2x .

Note:

   Problem:

Determine the maximum area if we want to make the same rectangular
garden as in [link], but we have 200 ft of fencing.

Solution:

   The maximum area is 5000 ft . 2
Hint

We  need   to  maximize  the  function  A  (x)   =  200x    -           2  over  the   interval

                                                               2x

Now let's look at a general strategy for solving optimization problems similar to
[link].

Note:
Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Optimization Problems

   1. Introduce all variables. If applicable, draw a figure and label all variables.
   2. Determine which quantity is to be maximized or minimized, and for what

      range of values of the other variables (if this can be determined at this
      time).
   3. Write a formula for the quantity to be maximized or minimized in terms of
      the variables. This formula may involve more than one variable.
   4. Write any equations relating the independent variables in the formula from
      step 3. Use these equations to write the quantity to be maximized or
      minimized as a function of one variable.
   5. Identify the domain of consideration for the function in step 4 based on the
      physical problem to be solved.
   6. Locate the maximum or minimum value of the function from step 4. This
      step typically involves looking for critical points and evaluating a function
      at endpoints.

Now let's apply this strategy to maximize the volume of an open-top box given a
constraint on the amount of material to be used.

   Problem:
   Maximizing the Volume of a Box

   An open-top box is to be made from a 24 in. by 36 in. piece of cardboard
   by removing a square from each corner of the box and folding up the flaps
   on each side. What size square should be cut out of each corner to get a box
   with the maximum volume?
Solution:

Step 1: Let x be the side length of the square to be removed from each
corner ([link]). Then, the remaining four flaps can be folded up to form an
open-top box. Let V be the volume of the resulting box.

A square with side length x inches is removed from each corner of
the piece of cardboard. The remaining flaps are folded to form an

                                open-top box.

Step 2: We are trying to maximize the volume of a box. Therefore, the
problem is to maximize V .

Step 3: As mentioned in step 2, are trying to maximize the volume of a box.
The volume of a box is V = L  W  H, where L, W , and H are the
length, width, and height, respectively.

Step 4: From [link], we see that the height of the box is x inches, the length
is 36 - 2x inches, and the width is 24 - 2x inches. Therefore, the volume
of the box is
Equation:

3  2
V (x) = (36 - 2x) (24 - 2x)x = 4x - 120x + 864x.
Step 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let's examine [link].
Certainly, we need x > 0. Furthermore, the side length of the square cannot
be greater than or equal to half the length of the shorter side, 24 in.;
otherwise, one of the flaps would be completely cut off. Therefore, we are
trying to determine whether there is a maximum volume of the box for x
over the open interval (0, 12). Since V is a continuous function over the
closed interval [0, 12], we know V will have an absolute maximum over
the closed interval. Therefore, we consider V over the closed interval
[0, 12] and check whether the absolute maximum occurs at an interior

point.

Step 6: Since V (x) is a continuous function over the closed, bounded
interval [0, 12], V must have an absolute maximum (and an absolute
minimum). Since V (x) = 0 at the endpoints and V (x) > 0 for
0 < x < 12, the maximum must occur at a critical point. The derivative is
Equation:

                                                    2
       V (x) = 12x - 240x + 864.

To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation
Equation:

                                                                                               2

                                                          12x - 240x + 864 = 0.

Dividing both sides of this equation by 12, the problem simplifies to
solving the equation
Equation:

                                                                                               2

                                                                x - 20x + 72 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, we find that the critical points are
Equation:

                                                 2     20±112     20±47

    20±(-20) - 4 (1) (72)

x=                                                  =          =                                     = 10±27.

    2                                                  2                                          2
Since 10 + 27 is not in the domain of consideration, the only critical
point we need to consider is 10 - 27. Therefore, the volume is
maximized if we let x = 10 - 27 in. The maximum volume is

V  (10  -  27)  =  640  +  4487                                3  as  shown  in  the  following

                                   1825 in.

graph.

         Maximizing the volume of the box leads to finding the maximum
                               value of a cubic polynomial.

   Problem:
   Minimizing Travel Time

   An island is 2 mi due north of its closest point along a straight shoreline. A
   visitor is staying at a cabin on the shore that is 6 mi west of that point. The
   visitor is planning to go from the cabin to the island. Suppose the visitor
   runs at a rate of 8 mph and swims at a rate of 3 mph. How far should the
   visitor run before swimming to minimize the time it takes to reach the
   island?

   Solution:

   Step 1: Let x be the distance running and let y be the distance swimming
   ([link]). Let T be the time it takes to get from the cabin to the island.
How can we choose x and y to minimize the travel time from the
                           cabin to the island?

Step 2: The problem is to minimize T .

Step 3: To find the time spent traveling from the cabin to the island, add the
time spent running and the time spent swimming. Since Distance = Rate
× Time (D = R × T ), the time spent running is
Equation:

                                Drunning         x

Trunning =                                    =     ,

                                Rrunning         8

and the time spent swimming is
Equation:

                                Dswimming           y

Tswimming =                                   =.

                                Rswimming           3

Therefore, the total time spent traveling is
Equation:

                                                    x                                  y

                                           T=                                          +.

                                                    8                                  3

Step 4: From [link], the line segment of y miles forms the hypotenuse of a
right triangle with legs of length 2 mi and 6 - x mi. Therefore, by the
Pythagorean theorem, 22 + (6 - x) = y , 2 2 and we obtain

y  =  (6  -            2  +  4.  Thus,  the  total  time                               spent  traveling   is  given  by  the

               x)

function
Equation:

                                                                                                 2

                                           x (6 - x) + 4

                                 T (x) =      +                                                     .

                                           8                                              3

Step 5: From [link], we see that 0  x  6. Therefore, [0, 6] is the domain
of consideration.

Step 6: Since T (x) is a continuous function over a closed, bounded
interval, it has a maximum and a minimum. Let's begin by looking for any
critical points of T over the interval [0, 6]. The derivative is
Equation:

    11                                                                           -1/2                  1             (6 - x)
                                                           2

                             [(6 - x) + 4]

T (x) =        -                                                                        2 (6 - x) =       -                      .

            8     2                     3                                                              8                      2

                                                                                                              3(6 - x) + 4

If T  (x) = 0, then
Equation:

                                 1                  6-x

                                        =                                                     .

                                 8                                                        2

                                             3(6 - x) + 4

Therefore,
Equation:

               3 2 (6 - x) + 4 = 8(6 - x).

Squaring both sides of this equation, we see that if x satisfies this equation,
then x must satisfy
Equation:

               2                                      2

               9 [(6 - x) + 4] = 64(6 - x) ,

which implies
Equation:

                                                 2

               55(6 - x) = 36.

We conclude that if x is a critical point, then x satisfies
Equation:

                                         2  36
                                                   .
               (x - 6) =
                                            55

Therefore, the possibilities for critical points are
Equation:

                       6

               x = 6±                       .

                       55

Since x = 6 + 6/55 is not in the domain, it is not a possibility for a
critical point. On the other hand, x = 6 - 6/55 is in the domain. Since
we squared both sides of [link] to arrive at the possible critical points, it
remains to verify that x = 6 - 6/55 satisfies [link]. Since
x = 6 - 6/55 does satisfy that equation, we conclude that
x = 6 - 6/55 is a critical point, and it is the only one. To justify that the
time is minimized for this value of x, we just need to check the values of
T (x) at the endpoints x = 0 and x = 6, and compare them with the value
of T (x) at the critical point x = 6 - 6/55. We find that
T (0)  2.108 h and T (6)  1.417 h, whereas

T (6 - 6/55)  1.368 h. Therefore, we conclude that T has a local

minimum at x  5.19 mi.

In business, companies are interested in maximizing revenue. In the following
example, we consider a scenario in which a company has collected data on how
many cars it is able to lease, depending on the price it charges its customers to
rent a car. Let's use these data to determine the price the company should charge
to maximize the amount of money it brings in.

Example:
Exercise:
Problem:
Maximizing Revenue

Owners of a car rental company have determined that if they charge
customers p dollars per day to rent a car, where 50  p  200, the number
of cars n they rent per day can be modeled by the linear function
n (p) = 1000 - 5p. If they charge $50 per day or less, they will rent all
their cars. If they charge $200 per day or more, they will not rent any cars.
Assuming the owners plan to charge customers between $50 per day and
$200 per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their
revenue?

Solution:

Step 1: Let p be the price charged per car per day and let n be the number
of cars rented per day. Let R be the revenue per day.

Step 2: The problem is to maximize R.

Step 3: The revenue (per day) is equal to the number of cars rented per day
times the price charged per car per day--that is, R = n × p.

Step 4: Since the number of cars rented per day is modeled by the linear
function n (p) = 1000 - 5p, the revenue R can be represented by the
function
Equation:

                                                                                                                                                                                2

                          R (p) = n × p = (1000 - 5p)p = -5p + 1000p.

Step 5: Since the owners plan to charge between $50 per car per day and
$200 per car per day, the problem is to find the maximum revenue R (p)
for p in the closed interval [50, 200].

Step 6: Since R is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval
[50, 200], it has an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that
interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points. The derivative
is R (p) = -10p + 1000. Therefore, the critical point is p = 100 When
p = 100, R (100) = $50,000. When p = 50, R (p) = $37,500. When
p = 200, R (p) = $0. Therefore, the absolute maximum occurs at
   p = $100. The car rental company should charge $100 per day per car to
   maximize revenue as shown in the following figure.

          To maximize revenue, a car rental company has to
       balance the price of a rental against the number of cars

                       people will rent at that price.

Note:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   A car rental company charges its customers p dollars per day, where
   60  p  150. It has found that the number of cars rented per day can be
   modeled by the linear function n (p) = 750 - 5p. How much should the
   company charge each customer to maximize revenue?
   Solution:
   The company should charge $75 per car per day.
Hint
R (p) = n × p, where n is the number of cars rented and p is the price charged
per car.

   Problem:
   Maximizing the Area of an Inscribed Rectangle
   A rectangle is to be inscribed in the ellipse
   Equation:

                                                                               x2

                                                                                                                                        2

                                                                                       + y = 1.
                                                                                4

   What should the dimensions of the rectangle be to maximize its area? What
   is the maximum area?
   Solution:
   Step 1: For a rectangle to be inscribed in the ellipse, the sides of the
   rectangle must be parallel to the axes. Let L be the length of the rectangle
   and W be its width. Let A be the area of the rectangle.

          We want to maximize the area of a rectangle inscribed in an
                                          ellipse.
Step 2: The problem is to maximize A.

Step 3: The area of the rectangle is A = LW .

Step 4: Let (x, y) be the corner of the rectangle that lies in the first
quadrant, as shown in [link]. We can write length L = 2x and width

W = 2y. Since x + y = 1 2 2 and y > 0, we have y = 1 - x . 2
           4                                                                              4

Therefore, the area is

Equation:

                                                   x2

A = LW = (2x) (2y) = 4x1 -                                               = 2x4 - x2.

                                                                      4

Step 5: From [link], we see that to inscribe a rectangle in the ellipse, the x-
coordinate of the corner in the first quadrant must satisfy 0 < x < 2.
Therefore, the problem reduces to looking for the maximum value of A (x)
over the open interval (0, 2). Since A (x) will have an absolute maximum
(and absolute minimum) over the closed interval [0, 2], we consider

A (x) = 2x4 - x2 over the interval [0, 2]. If the absolute maximum
occurs at an interior point, then we have found an absolute maximum in the
open interval.

Step 6: As mentioned earlier, A (x) is a continuous function over the
closed, bounded interval [0, 2]. Therefore, it has an absolute maximum (and
absolute minimum). At the endpoints x = 0 and x = 2, A (x) = 0. For
0 < x < 2, A (x) > 0. Therefore, the maximum must occur at a critical
point. Taking the derivative of A (x), we obtain
Equation:

           A(x)         = 24 - x2 + 2x                                   1

                           4-x2
To find critical points, we need to find where A(x) = 0. We can see that if
x is a solution of
Equation:

                                        8 - 4x2   = 0,
                                       4 - x2

then x must satisfy
Equation:

                                                              2

                                       8 - 4x = 0.

Therefore,      2  =  2.  Thus,  x  =  ±2    are  the  possible        solutions  of  [link].

            x

Since we are considering x over the interval [0, 2], x = 2 is a possibility

for a critical point, but x = -2 is not. Therefore, we check whether 2

is a solution of [link]. Since x = 2 is a solution of [link], we conclude

that 2 is the only critical point of A (x) in the interval [0, 2]. Therefore,

A (x) must have an absolute maximum at the critical point x = 2. To
determine the dimensions of the rectangle, we need to find the length L and

the width W . If x = 2 then
Equation:

                                          2

                                     (2)                         1     1

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are L = 2x = 22 and
W = 2y = 2 = 2. The area of this rectangle is

                                          2

If (x, y) is the vertex of the square that lies in the first quadrant, then the area of
the square is A = (2x) (2y) = 4xy.

Solving Optimization Problems when the Interval Is Not Closed or
Is Unbounded

In the previous examples, we considered functions on closed, bounded domains.
Consequently, by the extreme value theorem, we were guaranteed that the
functions had absolute extrema. Let's now consider functions for which the
domain is neither closed nor bounded.

Many functions still have at least one absolute extrema, even if the domain is not

closed  or  the  domain  is  unbounded.  For  example,  the  function  f  (x)  =      2  +  4

                                                                                  x

over (-, ) has an absolute minimum of 4 at x = 0. Therefore, we can still

consider functions over unbounded domains or open intervals and determine

whether they have any absolute extrema. In the next example, we try to minimize

a function over an unbounded domain. We will see that, although the domain of

consideration is (0, ), the function has an absolute minimum.

In the following example, we look at constructing a box of least surface area with
a prescribed volume. It is not difficult to show that for a closed-top box, by
symmetry, among all boxes with a specified volume, a cube will have the
smallest surface area. Consequently, we consider the modified problem of
determining which open-topped box with a specified volume has the smallest
surface area.
Example:
Exercise:

   Problem:
   Minimizing Surface Area

   A rectangular box with a square base, an open top, and a volume of 216 in.3
   is to be constructed. What should the dimensions of the box be to minimize
   the surface area of the box? What is the minimum surface area?

   Solution:

   Step 1: Draw a rectangular box and introduce the variable x to represent the
   length of each side of the square base; let y represent the height of the box.
   Let S denote the surface area of the open-top box.

   We want to
  minimize the
surface area of a
square-based box
   with a given

     volume.

Step 2: We need to minimize the surface area. Therefore, we need to
minimize S.

Step 3: Since the box has an open top, we need only determine the area of

the four vertical sides and the base. The area of each of the four vertical

sides  is  x    y.  The  area  of  the  base  is      2  Therefore,  the  surface  area  of  the

                                                  x.

box is

Equation:
                                                                                          2

                                             S = 4xy + x .

Step 4: Since the volume of this box is x2y and the volume is given as

216           3  ,  the  constraint  equation                             is

     in.

Equation:

                                                                              2

                                                                          x y = 216.

Solving the constraint equation for y, we have y = x2 . 216 Therefore, we can
write the surface area as a function of x only:
Equation:

                                                                                       216           2

                                     S (x) = 4x (                                             )+x .

                                                                                       x2

Therefore, S (x) = 864 + x2.
                                                                       x

Step  5:  Since          we  are  requiring                               that      2  =   216,  we     cannot  have  x  =  0.

                                                                                xy

Therefore, we need x > 0. On the other hand, x is allowed to have any

positive value. Note that as x becomes large, the height of the box y

becomes             correspondingly  small                                so    that       2  =  216.   Similarly,  as  x  becomes

                                                                                       xy

small, the height of the box becomes correspondingly large. We conclude

that the domain is the open, unbounded interval (0, ). Note that, unlike

the previous examples, we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an

absolute maximum or absolute minimum over a closed, bounded interval.

However, in the next step, we discover why this function must have an

absolute minimum over the interval (0, ).

Step 6: Note that as x  0+, S (x)  . Also, as x  , S (x)  .
Since S is a continuous function that approaches infinity at the ends, it
must have an absolute minimum at some x  (0, ). This minimum must
occur at a critical point of S. The derivative is
Equation:

                                          864                                                 + 2x.
                                     S (x) = -

                                                                   x2
Therefore, S  (x) = 0 when 2x =                                         864       .  Solving   this        equation  for   x,   we

                                                                               2
                                                                        x

obtain  x3   =  432,               so          x  =     3          =             3      Since  this  is    the   only  critical  point

                                                     432                62.

of  S,  the  absolute              minimum               must        occur           at  x  =           3  (see  [link]).  When

                                                                                               62

       We can use a graph to determine the dimensions of a
