                     2.1-2.2: Spreadsheets and Simple and Compound Interest

Personal Reflections:
1. Do you use a budget? Why or why not?

2. List some places in your finances where you might be able to save a few dollars or more
    per week or per month.

                          2.2: Simple and Compound Interest

Simple Interest                                Compound Interest
Definition: Interest is only earned (or paid)  Definition: Interest is earned on the
on the original amount.                        original amount and any interest added to
                                               the account.

Example: You invest $500 and you earn 6%       Example: You invest $500 at a rate of 6%
interest every year for 5 years.               interest compounded yearly for 5 years.

Using Spreadsheet Formulas for Compound Interest

You will need to use Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets while you watch these videos. You can
use a computer, tablet or smart phone with the Google Sheets App.

Future Value Formula                Present Value Formula

=FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])  =PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])

Inputs:
         rate =

nper =

pmt =

pv =

fv =

[type] =

Example 1. If you invest $500 at 6% interest, calculate the balance after 5 years for each
compounding interval. Write the formula used and inputs in proper syntax.

    o Simple Interest

o Compounded Yearly

o Compounded Quarterly

o Compounded Monthly

o Compounded Daily (365)

o Compounded Continuously

Compounding Continuously                       Effective Rate
If we let the number of compounding            The corresponding rate if compounded
periods go to infinity, we get a base of e in  yearly. Used to compare different
our function.                                  compounding options.

      =                                        =effect(nominal rate, periods
                                               per year)
=P*exp(rate*years)

Example 2. Write the formula used and the inputs in proper syntax. Answer each question
with a complete sentence, including units.

         a. How much would you need to deposit in an account that pays 5.25% compounded
             monthly to have $20,000 in 20 years?

b. You get an inheritance of $15,000 and you decide to put it in an account that pays
    7.1% interest compounded continuously. How much would it be worth in 25 years?

c. You decide to save your tax refund of $1000 in an account that pays 6.5%
    compounded quarterly. How much would you have in 15 years?

d. You are shopping for savings accounts and you find one with a rate of 3.25%
    compounded monthly and one with a rate of 3.15% compounded daily. Find the
    effective rates to determine which account has a better rate.

You will need to use Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets while you watch these videos. You can

=FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])  =PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])

Saving with an initial deposit and/or monthly payments.

Example 1. Write the formula used and the inputs in proper syntax. Answer each question
with a complete sentence, including units.

         a. You want to save $100 per month at an annual rate of 8% interest. How much will
             you have after 15 years?

b. You want to save $1000 now and $50 per month for 10 years. How much will you
    have if you find an account with 7% interest?

Payment Formula

=PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type])

Example 2. Write the formula used and the inputs in proper syntax. Answer each question
with a complete sentence, including units.

         a. You want to save $30,000 for the down payment on a house in 5 years at an annual
             rate of 5% interest. How much do you need to set aside per month?

b. Your company needs $2,000,000 for an expansion project in 5 years. How much
    should be deposited quarterly in an account that earns 8% interest compounded
    quarterly?
