2. What would you say are the key steps to problem solving?

                                                      1.3 Percents

3. A TV originally priced at $799 is on sale for 30% off in Vancouver, WA. There is an 8.7%
    sales tax. Find the price after including the discount and sales tax.

4. Would you rather use a 30%-off coupon or a 20%-off coupon and then a 15%-off
    coupon? What percentage of an item would you pay under each option?

Absolute and Relative Change

Absolute change is the difference in two quantities and has the same units as the original
quantities.
Relative change is the absolute change and is written as a percentage increase or decrease.

                                       starting quantity

The starting quantity is called the base of the percent change.

5. A laptop that usually sells for $1599.99 is on sale for $1349.99. What is the relative change
    in the cost? This sale is in Oregon so there is no sales tax.

6. The U.S. federal debt at the end of 2021 was $28.39 trillion, and grew to $30.84 trillion by
    the end of 2022. At the end of 2005 it was $7.91 trillion, and grew to $8.45 trillion by the
    end of 20061. Calculate the absolute and relative changes for 2005-2006 and 2021-2022.
    Which year saw a larger absolute change and relative change in the federal debt?

          1.4: Rates and Proportions

7. List 3 things in life that are generally proportional and 3 things that are not generally
    proportional.

Unit Rates

8. Would you rather buy a box of aluminum foil with 50 square feet for $2.99 or 75 square
    feet for $3.99? Find the unit price of each and explain your reasoning.

Solving Proportion Problems

Use any method to solve these problems. Show your steps so we can follow your thinking.

9. Thai made $87,000 in gross income last year and paid $15,051 in taxes. If tax rates are
    proportional, how much should someone who makes $1,000,000 pay? Do you think tax
    rates are proportional?

10. A crepe recipe calls for 2 eggs, 3/4 cup of flour and 1 cup of milk. How much flour would
    you need if you use 5 eggs?

Problems with unit conversions

You can use the internet to look up any conversions you need. Please write down the
conversions you use.

11. Would you Rather 500 pounds of pennies or 40 pounds of quarters?

a. Write down any assumptions you make.

b. Write down any additional information you use. This site can help: Coin Specifications.

d. Write out your conclusion with reasoning.

Note: This is based on a true story. Did you get the same answer for the pennies as listed in the
article? If not, why do you think they are different?

Problems with unit conversions and/or geometry

It may be helpful to recall some formulas for areas and volumes of a few basic shapes.

Areas               Circle, radius r
Rectangle
Area: L W           Area: r2
Perimeter: 2L + 2W  Circumference = 2r

                                                                   radius
W

          L

12. Painting a wall rates - scaling a ratio. Sally can paint a 10x10 foot wall in 2 hours. At the
    same rate, how long would it take her to paint a 30x8 foot wall? Do you think the rates
    would be the same? What are some factors that would affect this?

13. A very veggie pizza at Pizzicato is available in 3 sizes with the prices shown in the table
    below. Are these prices proportional to the amount of pizza? If not, which is the best deal?
    Which is the worst deal?

Size             Price
Small, 10-inch   $16.00
Medium, 12-inch  $21.25
Large, 16-inch   $30.50
