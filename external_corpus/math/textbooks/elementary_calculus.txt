                          Preface

This book covers calculus of a single variable. It is suitable for a year-long (or two-semester)
course, normally known as Calculus I and II in the United States. The prerequisites are high
school or college algebra, geometry and trigonometry. The book is designed for students in
engineering, physics, mathematics, chemistry and other sciences.

   One reason for writing this text was because I had already written its sequel, Vector Cal-
culus. More importantly, I was dissatisfied with the current crop of calculus textbooks, which
I feel are bloated and keep moving further away from the subject's roots in physics. In addi-
tion, many of the intuitive approaches and techniques from the early days of calculus--which
I think often yield more insights for students--seem to have been lost.

   I agree with the views of the late Russian mathematician V.I. Arnold on teaching mathe-
matics, in particular the idea that "Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are
cheap."1 The ties to physics are especially important in calculus, so this book tries to introduce
new concepts with physical motivations (what other motivations can there be?). The book con-
tains exercises and examples that I hope will adequately prepare students who continue on in
physics and engineering.2

   Perhaps controversially, the book uses infinitesimals, making it a bit of a "throwback" or
"retro" calculus text. My justification for this heretical act was purely pedagogical: infinitesi-
mals make learning calculus easier, and their use aligns more with the way students will see
calculus in their physics, chemistry and other science classes and textbooks (where infinitesi-
mals are employed liberally). This might ruffle some feathers among mathematical "purists,"
but they are not the main audience for this book. That said, the book is still compatible with the
usual limit-based approach, so an instructor could simply ignore the parts involving infinites-
imals and teach the material as he or she normally would. I did not want to be dogmatic, so I
used infinitesimals where I thought it made sense, and used limits where appropriate (e.g. in
discussing continuity, series). Again, pedagogy was my priority.

   The exercises at the end of each section are divided into three categories: A, B and C. The
A exercises are mostly of a routine computational nature, the B exercises are slightly more
involved, and the C exercises usually require some effort or insight to solve. A crude way of

 2The book covers some of the types of problems and techniques for solving them that such students will likely
encounter. Facility with using named constants (e.g. c, h, T) is also emphasized.

                                                                                                                                iii

describing A, B and C would be "Easy", "Moderate" and "Challenging", respectively. However,
many of the B exercises are easy and not all the C exercises are difficult. Appendix A provides
answers and hints to many of the odd-numbered and some of the even-numbered exercises.

   A few exercises require the student to write a computer program to solve numerical approx-
imation problems (e.g. numerical methods for approximating definite integrals). Algorithms
are presented in pseudocode, with code implementations in various languages (primarily Java,
but also Python, Octave, Sage). I hope the code comments will help the reader figure out what
is being done, regardless of familiarity with those languages. Students are free to implement
solutions using the language of their choice. There are no dedicated "calculator exercises," as
those have been rendered pointless by modern computing (with which students need to become
acquainted).

   Stylistically I made a conscious effort to break from an unfortunate but all too common
mode of writing in mathematics texts, lamented in the preface of a physics book: "Nothing
is more repellent to normal human beings than the clinical succession of definitions, axioms,
and theorems generated by the labours of pure mathematicians."3 I have been guilty of that
sin myself, but I have changed my ways and banished all traces of that sort of thing from this
book. So you won't find Definition 1.2, Theorem 3.3, Corollary 4.6, Lemma 5.7, Axiom 1B,
etc. Instead, I tried to borrow the best of the styles from the physics and foreign languages
textbooks I enjoyed so much in college. I also deliberately avoided what the author Gore Vidal
called the "we-ness" that prevails in academic writing. There is no good reason for the "royal
we" in a textbook, and it comes off as a bit pompous, so we won't use it.

                   The Derivative

1.1 Introduction

Calculus can be thought of as the analysis of curved shapes.1 Its development grew out of
attempts to solve physical problems. For example, suppose that an object at rest 100 ft above
the ground is dropped. Ignoring air resistance and wind, the object will fall straight down until
it hits the ground (see Figure 1.1.1(a)). As will be proved later, t seconds after being dropped
the object will be s = s(t) = -16t2 + 100 ft above the ground. The object will thus hit the ground
after 2.5 seconds (when s = 0). While the object's path is a straight line, the graph of its position
s above the ground as a function of time t is curved, part of a parabola (see Figure 1.1.1(b)).

                                                                            s

        t = 0 sec          100

        Figure 1.1.1 An object dropped from 100 ft above the ground

   How fast is the object moving before it hits the ground? This is where calculus comes in. The
solution, presented now, will motivate much of this chapter.

 1It is more than that, of course, but that definition puts us in good company: the first European textbook on
calculus, written by the French mathematician Guillaume de l'Hôpital in 1696, was titled Analyse des Infiniment
Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes (which translates as Analysis of the Infinitely Small for Understanding
Curved Lines). That book (in French) can be obtained freely in electronic form at https://archive.org

                                                                     1
2 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                           §1.1

First, the object travels 100 ft in 2.5 seconds, so its average speed in that time is

               distance traveled            100 ft           = 40 ft/s,
                                         =
               time elapsed                 2.5 seconds

and its average velocity in that time is

change in position change in time = final position - initial position end time - start time = 0 ft - 100 ft 2.5 sec - 0 sec = -40 ft/s.

Unlike speed, velocity takes direction into account. Thus, the object's downward motion means
it has negative velocity. Positive velocity implies upward motion.

   Using the idea of average velocity over an interval of time, there is a natural way to define
the object's instantaneous velocity at a particular instant of time t:

1. Find the average velocity over an interval of time.

2. Let the interval become smaller and smaller indefinitely, shrinking to a point t. If the
    average velocity over that smaller and smaller interval approaches some value, call that
    value the instantaneous velocity at time t.

Figure 1.1.2 below shows how to choose the interval: for any time t between 0 and 2.5, use
the interval [t, t + t], where t (pronounced "delta t") is a small positive number. So t is the
change in time over the interval; denote by s the change in the position s over that interval.

The average velocity of the object over the interval [t, t +t] is t s , so since s(t) = -16t2 +100:

                          s = s(t + t) - s(t)

                                   -16(t + t)2 + 100 - (-16t2 + 100)
                               = t

                                   -16t2 - 32tt - 16(t)2 + 100 + 16t2 - 100
                               = t

                                   -32tt - 16(t)2 t (-32t - 16t)
                               = t = t

                               = -32t - 16t ,

Now let the interval [t, t+t] get smaller and smaller indefinitely--that is, let t get closer and

closer  to  0.  Then  the  average  velocity    s   =  -32 t - 16 t  gets  closer  and  closer  to  -32 t - 0  =  -32t.
                                                t
Thus, the object has instantaneous velocity -32t at time t. This calculation can be interpreted

as taking the limit of       s  as t  approaches 0, written as follows:
                             t

instantaneous velocity at t = limit of average velocity over [t, t + t] as t approaches to 0

                                    = lim s
                                        t0 t

                                    = lim (-32t - 16t)

                                         t0

                                    = -32t - 16(0)
                                    = -32t

Notice      that  t   is  not  replaced  by  0  in  the  ratio  s  until  after  doing  as  much    cancellation  as
                                                                t
possible. Notice also that the instantaneous velocity of the object varies with t, as it should

(why?). In particular, at the instant when the object hits the ground at time t = 2.5 sec, the

instantaneous velocity is -32(2.5) = -80 ft/s.

If this makes sense so far, then you understand the crux of the idea of what a limit is and

how to calculate a limit. The instantaneous velocity v(t) = -32t is called the derivative of the
position function s(t) = -16t2 + 100. Calculating derivatives, analyzing their properties, and

using them to solve various problems are part of differential calculus.

What does this have to do with curved shapes? Instantaneous velocity is a special case of an

instantaneous rate of change of a function; in this case the instantaneous rate of change

of the position (height above the ground) of the object. Similar to how the rate of change of a

line is its slope, the instantaneous rate of change of a general curve represents the slope of
the curve. For example, the parabola s(t) = -16t2 + 100 has slope -32t for all t. Note that the

slope of this curve varies (as a function of t), unlike the slope of a straight line.

   Finding the area inside curved regions is another type of problem that calculus can solve.
The basic idea is to use simpler regions--rectangles--whose areas are known, then use those
to approximate the area inside the curved region. One such method is to draw more and more
rectangles of diminishing widths inside the curved region,2 so that the sums of their areas
approach the area of the curved region. Figure 1.1.3 shows an example with four rectangles to
approximate the area under a curve y = f (x) over an interval [a, b] on which f (x)  0.

   The limit of these sums of rectangular areas is called an integral. The study and application
of integrals are part of integral calculus. Perhaps the most remarkable result in calculus is
that there is a connection between derivatives and integrals--the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, discovered in the 17th century, independently, by the two men who invented calculus
as we know it: English physicist, astronomer and mathematician Isaac Newton (1642-1727)
and German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716).

   Calculus makes extensive use of infinite sequences and series. An infinite series is just a
sum of an infinite number of terms. For example, it will be shown later in the text that

 = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ··· ,                                                                                (1.1)
4                             3579

where the sum on the right involves an infinite number of terms. A power series is a partic-
ular type of infinite series applied to functions; it can be thought of as a polynomial of infinite
degree. For example, the trigonometric function sin x does not appear to be a polynomial. But
it turns out that sin x has a power series representation as

sin x = x - x + - + - · · · 3 x5 x7 x9 ,                                                                    (1.2)
                    3! 5! 7! 9!

where again the sum continues infinitely, and the formula holds for all x (in radians).
   The idea of replacing a function by its power series played an important role throughout the

development of calculus, and is a powerful technique in many applications.
   All the functions in this text will be functions of a single real variable--that is, the values

that the variable can take are real numbers. Below is some standard notation for commonly-
used sets of numbers:

2It will be shown later (in Chapter 5) that the rectangles do not have to be completely inside the region.
                                                                            Introduction · Section 1.1 5

     N = the set of all natural numbers, i.e. the set of nonnegative integers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .

     Z = the set of all integers: 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, . . .

     Q = the set of all rational numbers m , where m and n are integers, with n = 0
                                                           n

     R = the set of all real numbers

Note that N  Z  Q  R.
   The set of real numbers consists of the rational numbers together with numbers that are

not rational, called irrational numbers. For example, 2 is irrational. That is, 2 is not the
square of a rational number. In fact, if the square of a rational number q were an integer,
then q itself would have to be an integer: write q as m/n, where m and n are positive integers
with no common positive integer divisors other than 1. Since q2 = m2/n2 simply duplicates the
integer divisors of m and n, then q2 can be an integer only if n = 1, i.e. q is an integer. Clearly
2 is not the square of an integer, and thus it cannot be the square of a rational number. This
argument also shows that 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and so on, are irrational.3

   It turns out that there are far more irrational numbers-and hence real numbers--than ra-
tional numbers. In fact, whereas the rational numbers can be listed in a sequence (i.e. first,
second, third, etc.), the set of real numbers cannot.4 For example, in the closed interval [0, 1]
there is no "next" real number after the number 0. Thus, some infinite sets are larger than
others--R is larger than Q. Intervals such as [0, 1] or R itself are examples of a continuum
of objects, i.e. no gaps exist.5 A famous unsolved problem in mathematics--the Continuum
Hypothesis--is whether an infinite set exists that is larger in size than Q but smaller than R.

   Infinity is an important notion in calculus. Whether it is the idea of infinitely large or in-
finitesimally small, calculus attempts to give the idea some mathematical meaning (typically
by way of limits).6 The mathematical use of infinity has been a subject of philosophical debate.7

   Though several centuries old, calculus was the beginning of modern mathematics. Classical
mathematics (e.g. algebra, geometry, trigonometry)--whose origins date back to the ancient
Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks--was concerned mostly with the study of static quantities.
Calculus produced a way to analyze dynamic (i.e. changing) quantities. The period from the
17th through the 19th century also saw revolutionary advances in physics, chemistry, biology
and other sciences. The birth of calculus was one part of that qualitative leap.

 3This argument is due to the British philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872-1970). For an alternative proof that 2
is irrational, see pp. 97-98 in GELFAND, I.M. AND A. SHEN, Algebra, Boston: Birkhäuser, 1993.

York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1967.

A

For Exercises 1-4, suppose that an object moves in a straight line such that its position s after time t
is the given function s = s(t). Find the instantaneous velocity of the object at a general time t  0. You
should mimic the earlier example for the instantaneous velocity when s = -16t2 + 100.

1. s = t2                 2. s = 9.8t2                      3. s = -16t2 + 2t          4. s = t3

      4 (1) = 4.0, and the second approximation is   4             1- 1     = 8/3  2.66667. Continue like this until

                                                                         3
    two consecutive approximations have 3 as the first digit before the decimal point. How many terms

    in the sum did this require? Be careful with rounding off in the approximations.

6. In elementary geometry you learned that the area inside a circle of radius r > 0 is r2 (that formula
    will be proved later in the text). So in particular, let C be a circle of radius 1. Then the area inside
    C is . That area can be approximated by Eudoxus' method of exhaustion.9 The idea is to inscribe
    regular polygons inside the circle, i.e. the vertexes of the polygons touch C. Recall from geometry
    that a polygon is regular if its sides are of equal length. By increasing the number of sides of the
    polygons, the areas inside the polygons will approach the area () of C. This was an early attempt
    at using what is now called a limit.10

7. What is the flaw in the following "proof " that  = 4?:
    Step 1: Draw a square around a circle of diameter d = 1. The circumference
    of the circle is thus  d = , and the perimeter of the square is 4.

                                                                                  d=1

Step 2: Remove corners from the square as shown in the picture on the right,      d=1
so that four new corners touch the circle. Notice that the perimeter of the
resulting polygon is still 4, since the lengths of the removed corner pieces are
duplicated in the new polygon, so that the lengths of all the vertical sides add
up to 2 while the lengths of all the horizontal sides add up to 2.

Step 3: Remove corners from the polygon in Step 2, as shown in the picture        d=1
on the right, so that eight new corners touch the circle. The perimeter of the
resulting polygon is again still 4.

Step 4: Continue this procedure indefinitely, with each successive polygon        d=1
still having a perimeter of 4 and becoming increasingly indistinguishable from
the circle. Since the perimeters of the polygons always equal 4 and approach
the circle's circumference (), then  must equal 4.

8. An infinite set is countable if its members can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the
    members of N, the set of natural numbers (0,1,2,3,4,...). Clearly N is itself countable. The set Z of
    all integers is also countable, by means of the following one-to-one correspondence with N:

                                       N 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ...
                                       Z 0 1 -1 2 -2 3 -3 4 -4 ...

    Show that Q (the set of all rational numbers) is countable. (Hint: The above correspondence for Z is
    an infinite list in one dimension (the horizontal direction). For Q think two-dimensionally.)

1.2 The Derivative: Limit Approach

The following definition generalizes the example from the previous section (concerning instan-
taneous velocity) to a general function f (x):

The derivative of a real-valued function f (x), denoted by f (x), is

                         f (x) = lim  f = lim f (x + x) - f (x)                        (1.3)
                         x0 x x0                                x

for x in the domain of f , provided that the limit exists.11

   For a general function f (x), the derivative f (x) represents the instantaneous rate of
change of f at x, i.e. the rate at which f changes at the "instant" x. For the limit part of
the definition only the intuitive idea of how to take a limit--as in the previous section--is
needed for now. Notice that the above definition makes the derivative f  itself a function of the
variable x. The function f  can be evaluated at specific values of x, or you can write its general
formula f (x).

   The (instantaneous) velocity of an object as the derivative of the object's position as a func-
tion of time is only one physical application of derivatives. There are many other examples:

The limit definition can be used for finding the derivatives of simple functions.

Example 1.1

Find the derivative of the function f (x) = 1.

Solution: By definition, f (x) = 1 for all x, so:

                         f (x) = lim f (x + x) - f (x)
                                                   x0  x

                                       = lim 1 - 1
                                          x0 x

                                       = lim 0
                                          x0 x

                                       = lim 0

                                           x0

                         f (x) = 0

11Recall that the domain of f is the set of all numbers x such that f (x) is defined.
                                                  The Derivative: Limit Approach · Section 1.2 9

  Notice in the above example that replacing x by 0 was unnecessary when taking the limit,
since the ratio x f (x+x) - f (x) simplified to 0 before taking the limit, and the limit of 0 is 0 regard-
less of what x approaches. In fact, the answer--namely, f (x) = 0 for all x--should have been
obvious without any calculations: the function f (x) = 1 is a constant function, so its value (1)
never changes , and thus its rate of change is always 0. Hence, its derivative is 0 everywhere.
Replacing the constant 1 by any constant yields the following important result:

                                  The derivative of any constant function is 0.

   The above discussion shows that the calculation in Example 1.1 was unnecessary. Consider

another example where no calculation is required to find the derivative: the function f (x) = x.
The graph of this function is just the line y = x in the x y-plane, and the rate of change of a line
is a constant, called its slope. The line y = x has a slope of 1, so the derivative of f (x) = x is
f (x) = 1 for all x. The formal calculation of the derivative, though unnecessary, verifies this:

f (x) = lim f (x + x) - f (x) = lim (x + x) - x = lim x = lim 1 = 1
           x0            x  x0  x                       x0 x x0

   Recall that a function whose graph is a line is called a linear function. For a general
linear function f (x) = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is its y-intercept, the same
argument as above for f (x) = x yields the following result:

           The derivative of any linear function is the slope of the line itself:
                             If f (x) = mx + b then f (x) = m for all x.

   The function f (x) = 1 from Example 1.1 is the special case where m = 0 and b = 1; its graph
is a horizontal line, so its slope (and hence its derivative) is 0 for all x. Likewise, the function

f (x) = 2x - 1 represents a line of slope m = 2, so its derivative is 2 for all x. Figure 1.2.1 shows
these and other linear functions y = f (x).

           y                    y f (x) = 2x - 1                         y

10 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                                                     §1.2

   Linear functions have a constant derivative--the constant being the slope of the line. The
converse turns out to be true: a function with a constant derivative must be a linear function.12
What types of functions do not have constant derivatives? The previous section discussed
such a function: the parabola s(t) = -16t2 + 100, whose derivative s(t) = -32t is clearly not a
constant function. In general, functions that represent curves (i.e. not straight lines) do not
change at a constant rate--that is precisely what makes them curved. So such functions do not
have a constant derivative.

Example 1.2

Find the derivative of the function f (x) = 1 . Also, find the instantaneous rate of change of f at x = 2.
                                                          x

Solution: For all x = 0, the derivative f (x) is:

                 f (x) = lim f (x + x) - f (x)
                           x0               x

                                         1     1
                                     x +x - x
                         = lim                         0    , so simplify the ratio before plugging in x = 0,
                                            x      0
                             x0

                         = lim       x - (x + x)       (after getting a common denominator)
                                       (x + x)x
                             x0            x

                         = lim -x
                            x0 x(x + x)x

                         = lim -1 = -1
                            x0 (x + x)x (x + 0)x

                 f (x) = - x21

The instantaneous rate of change of f at x = 2 is just the derivative f (x) evaluated at x = 2, that is,
               1      -1.
f  (2)  =  -  2    =  4
                2

   Notice          that  the   instantaneous       rate   of  change  f (2) = - 1        in  the  y

                                                                                      4
above example is a negative number. This should make sense, since
                                  1                                                                            f  (x)  =  1
the  function         f (x) =     x  is  changing  in  the  negative  direction  at      x = 2;                           x

that is, f (x) is decreasing in value at x = 2. This is plain to see from                         0x
                                  1                                                                         2
the graph of          f (x)   =   x  shown on the right.      In fact, for all x = 0 the
                           1                       x grows.13
function         f (x) =   x  is  decreasing as                This is  reflected in the
derivative f (x) = - 1x2 being negative for all x = 0. In general, a nega-
tive derivative means that the function is decreasing, while a positive

derivative means that it is increasing.

12This will be proved in Chapter 5.
13In this text, the rate of change of f (x) is always taken in the direction of increasing x, i.e. in the positive x
direction.
                                                The Derivative: Limit Approach · Section 1.2 11

   The problem with using the limit definition to find the derivative of a curved function is that
the calculations require more work, as the above example shows. As the functions become more
complicated those calculations can become difficult or even impossible. And though limits have
not yet been defined formally, for now the intuitively obvious idea of limits suffices, namely:

  For a real number a and a real-valued function f (x), say that the limit of f (x) as x ap-
  proaches a equals the number L, written as

                                                       lim f (x) = L ,

                                                                         xa

  if f (x) approaches L as x approaches a.
  Equivalently, this means that f (x) can be made as close as you want to L by choosing x
  close enough to a. Note that x can approach a from any direction.

Below are some simple rules for limits, which will be proved later:

Rules for Limits: Suppose that a is a real number and that f (x) and g(x) are real-valued

functions such that limxa f (x) and limxa g(x) both exist. Then:

(a) lim ( f (x) + g(x)) = lim f (x) + lim g(x)
xa      xa            xa

(b) lim ( f (x) - g(x)) = lim f (x) - lim g(x)
xa      xa            xa

(c) lim (k · f (x)) = k · lim f (x) for any constant k
xa      xa

(d) lim ( f (x) · g(x)) = lim f (x) · lim g(x)
xa      xa            xa

(e) lim f (x) = xlima f (x) , if lim g(x) = 0
xa g(x) lim g(x)  xa
    xa

   The above rules say that the limit of sums, differences, constant multiples, products, and
quotients is the sum, difference, constant multiple, product, and quotient, respectively, of the
limits. This seems intuitively obvious.

  These rules can be used for finding other expressions for the derivative. The quantity x rep-
resents a small number--positive or negative--that approaches 0, but it is common in mathe-
matics texts to use the letter h instead:14

                  f (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x)                      (1.4)
                      h0                        h

14Physics texts typically prefer the delta notation, since x represents a small change in some physical quantity x.
12 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                          §1.2

Another formulation is to set h = w - x in formula (1.4), which yields

          f (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x) = lim f (x + (w - x)) - f (x) ,
                 h0                 h           w-x0            w-x

so that

                                 f (x) = lim f (w) - f (x)                             (1.5)
                                            wx w - x

since w - x approaches 0 if and only if w approaches x. Another formulation replaces h by -h:

f (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x) = lim f (x + -h) - f (x) = lim - ( f (x) - f (x - h)) ,
          h0     h                  -h0         -h              -h0            -h

and thus

                                 f (x) = lim f (x) - f (x - h)                         (1.6)
                                       h0           h

since -h approaches 0 if and only if h approaches 0. The above formulations did not use the
Limit Rules, but the following result does:

Suppose that f (x) exists. Then

                     f (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x - h) .                           (1.7)
                                       h0       2h

Proof: Since f (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x) = lim f (x) - f (x - h) by formulas (1.4) and (1.6),
                 h0              h         h0           h
then Limit Rule (c) shows that

              1 f (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x) = lim f (x) - f (x - h) .
              2      h0                2h           h0          2h

Now use the idea that a - b = (a - c) + (c - b) for all a, b, and c to write:

lim f (x + h) - f (x - h) = lim ( f (x + h) - f (x)) + ( f (x) - f (x - h))
h0        2h         h0                         2h

                     = lim f (x + h) - f (x) + lim f (x) - f (x - h)           (by Limit Rule (a))
                     h0                2h       h0              2h

                     = 12 · f (x) + 12 · f (x)

                     = f (x)

                                                                                       QED
                                                The Derivative: Limit Approach · Section 1.2 13

   As an example of using these different formulations, recall that a function f is even if
f (-x) = f (x) for all x in the domain of f , and f is odd if f (-x) = - f (x) for all x in its domain.
For example, x2, x4, and cos x are even functions; x, x3, and sin x are odd functions. The
following result is often useful:

                            The derivative of an even function is an odd function.
                            The derivative of an odd function is an even function.

   To prove the first statement--the second is an exercise--suppose that f is an even function
and that f (x) exists for all x in its domain. Then

f (-x) = lim f (-x + h) - f (-x)                  by formula (1.4) with x replaced by -x
             h0                h                  since f is even
                                                  by Limit Rule (c), so
             = lim f (-(x - h)) - f (-x)
             h0                h

             = lim f (x - h) - f (x)
             h0             h

             = lim - ( f (x) - f (x - h))
             h0                h

             = - lim f (x) - f (x - h)
             h0                h

f (-x) = - f (x)                                  by formula (1.6),

which shows that f  is an odd function.
   Derivatives do not always exist, as the following example shows.

Example 1.3

Let f (x) = |x|. Show that f (0) does not exist.                                      y

Solution: Recall that the absolute value function f (x) = |x| is defined as

             f (x) = |x| =          x if x  0                                 y = -x               y=x
                                  -x if x < 0
                                                                                      0x

The graph consists of two lines meeting at the origin. For x  0 the graph             f (x) = |x|
is the line y = x, which has slope 1. For x  0 the graph is the line y = -x,

which has slope -1. These lines agree in value (y = 0) at x = 0, but their

slopes do not agree in value at x = 0. Therefore the derivative of f does not exist at x = 0, since the

derivative of a curve is just its slope. A more "formal" proof (which amounts to the same argument) is

outlined in the exercises.
14 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                                                            §1.2

   If the derivative f (x) exists then f is differentiable at x. A differentiable function is
one that is differentiable at every point in its domain. For example, f (x) = x is a differentiable
function, but f (x) = |x| is not differentiable at x = 0. The act of calculating a derivative is called
differentiation. For example, differentiating the function f (x) = x yields f (x) = 1.

                                                 Exercises

Note: For all exercises, you can use anything discussed so far (including previous exercises).

For Exercises 1-11, find the derivative of the given function f (x) for all x (unless indicated otherwise).

1. f (x) = 0       2. f (x) = 1 - 3x                    3. f (x) = (x + 1)2                 4. f (x) = 2x2 - 3x + 1

5. f (x) = x+11 , for all x = -1  6.  f  (x)  =  -1     for  all  x  =  -1      7.  f  (x)  =  1   ,  for  all  x  =  0

8. f (x) = x, for all x > 0 (Hint: Rationalize the numerator in the definition of the derivative.)

9. f (x) = x + 1, for all x > -1 10. f (x) = x2 + 1                             11. f (x) = x2 + 3x + 4

12. In Exercise 8 the point x = 0 was excluded when calculating f (x), even though x = 0 is in the
    domain of f (x) = x. Can you explain why x = 0 was excluded?

B

13. Show that for all functions f such that f (x) exists, f (x) = lim f (x) - f (w) .
                                                                                         wx x - w

14. True or false: If f and g are differentiable functions on an interval (a, b) and f (x) < g(x) for all x in
    (a, b), then f (x) < g(x) for all x in (a, b). If true, prove it; if false, give a counterexample. Would your
    answer change if the restriction of x to (a, b) were removed and all real x were used instead?

15. Show that the derivative of an odd function is an even function.

C

For Exercises 16-21, assuming that f (x) exists, prove the given formula.

16. f (x) = lim f (x + 2h) - f (x - 2h)                 17. f (x) = lim f (x + 3h) - f (x - 3h)
              h0   4h                                                       h0                 6h

20. lim w f (x) - x f (w) = f (x) - x f (x)             21. lim w = 2 f (x) - x2 f (w) 2x f (x) - x2 f (x)
wx            w-x                                                 wx        w-x

22. Show that f (x) = |x| is not differentiable at x = 0, using formula (1.4) for the derivative. Here you
    will have to use a part of the definition which has not been used yet: as h approaches 0, h can be
    either positive or negative. Consider those two cases in showing that the limit is not defined at x = 0.

23. Suppose that f (a + b) = f (a) f (b) for all a and b, and f (0) exists. Show that f (x) exists for all x.
      The Derivative: Infinitesimal Approach · Section 1.3 15

1.3 The Derivative: Infinitesimal Approach

Traditionally a function f of a variable x is written as y = f (x). The dependent variable y is
considered a function of the independent variable x. This allows taking the derivative of y
with respect to x, i.e. the derivative of y as a function of x, denoted by dx dy . This is simply a
different way of writing f (x), and is just one of many ways of denoting the derivative:

Notation for the derivative of y = f (x): The following are all equivalent:

dy    d                                   df
    , f (x) , ( f (x)) , y , y , f (x) ,      , D f (x)
dx    dx                                  dx

   The notation dx dy appears to denote a fraction: a quantity dy divided by a quantity dx. It turns
out that the derivative really can be thought of in that way, as a ratio of infinitesimals. In fact,
this was the way in which derivatives were used by the founders of calculus--Newton and, in
particular, Leibniz.15 Even today, this is often the way in which derivatives are thought of and
used in fields outside of mathematics, such as physics, engineering, and chemistry, perhaps
due to its more intuitive nature.

   The concept of infinitesimals used here is based on the nilsquare infinitesimal approach
developed by J.L. Bell16, namely:

  A number  is an infinitesimal if the conditions (a)-(d) hold:
  (a)  = 0

  (b) if  > 0 then  is smaller than any positive real number

  (c) if  < 0 then  is larger than any negative real number

  (d) 2 = 0 (and hence all higher powers of , such as 3 and 4, are also 0)
  Note: Any infinitesimal multiplied by a nonzero real number is also an infinitesimal, while
  0 times an infinitesimal is 0.

   The above definition says that infinitesimals are numbers which are closer to 0 than any
positive or negative number without being zero themselves, and raising them to powers greater
than or equal to 2 makes them 0. So infinitesimals are not real numbers.17 This is not a
problem, since calculus deals with other numbers, such as infinity, which are not real. An
infinitesimal can be thought of as an infinitely small number arbitrarily close to 0 but not 0.

15It was Leibniz who created the notation dx dy . For this reason dx dy is called the Leibniz notation for the derivative.
Newton used the dot notation y, which has fallen out of favor with mathematicians but is still used by many
physicists, especially when the independent variable represents time. Newton called derivatives fluxions. The
prime notation f  is due to the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813).

16 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                                 §1.3

   This might seem like a strange notion, but it really is not all that different from the limit
notion where, say, you let x approach 0 but not necessarily let it equal 0.18

   As for the square of a nonzero infinitesimal being 0, think of how a calculator handles the
squares of small numbers. For example, most calculators can display 10-8 as 0.00000001, and
will even let you add 1 to that to get 1.00000001. But when you square 10-8 and add 1 to it,
most calculators will display the sum as simply 1. The calculator treats the square of 10-8,
namely 10-16, as a number so small compared to 1 that it is effectively zero.19

   Notice a major difference between 0 and an infinitesimal : 2 · 0 and 0 are the same, but 2 
and  are distinct. This holds for any nonzero constant multiple, not just the number 2.

   The derivative dx dy of a function y = f (x) can now be defined in terms of infinitesimals:

Let dx be an infinitesimal such that f (x + dx) is defined. Then dy = f (x + dx) - f (x) is also
an infinitesimal, and the derivative of y = f (x) at x is the ratio of dy to dx:

                                          dy = f (x + dx) - f (x)                             (1.8)
                                          dx                    dx

The basic idea is that dx is an infinitesimally small change in the variable x, producing an
infinitesimally small change dy in the value of y = f (x).

Example 1.4

Show  that  the  derivative  of  y=  f (x) = x2  is  dy  = 2x.
                                                     dx

Solution: For any real number x,

                 dy = f (x + dx) - f (x)
                 dx                   dx

                                (x + dx)2 - x2
                             = dx

                                 x2 + 2x dx + (dx)2 - x2
                             = dx

                             = 2x dx + 0             since dx is an infinitesimal  (dx)2 = 0
                                      dx

                                2xdx
                             = dx
                             = 2x

18The infinitesimal approach was first developed in an axiomatic manner in the landmark book ROBINSON, A.,
Non-Standard Analysis, Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1966. Robinson showed that for all practical purposes calcu-
lus can be developed without resorting to limits, with equivalent results.
19Calculators do this for display reasons--most can show only 10-12 digits. Try this experiment on your calculator:
Add 1030, - 1030 , and 1 in two different ways: 1030 + - 1030 + 1, and 1030 + - 1030 + 1 . The first way will
give you the correct answer 1, but the second way yields 0. So addition is not always associative on calculators!
   The Derivative: Infinitesimal Approach · Section 1.3 17

   You might have noticed that the above example did not involve limits, and that the derivative
2x represents a real number (i.e. no infinitesimals appear in the final answer); this will always
be the case. Infinitesimals possess another useful property:

  Microstraightness Property: For the graph of a differentiable function, any part of the
  curve with infinitesimal length is a straight line segment.

   In other words, at the infinitesimal level differentiable curves are straight. The idea behind
this is simple. At various points on a nonstraight differentiable curve y = f (x) the distances
along the curve between the points are not quite the same as the lengths of the line segments
joining the points. For example, in Figure 1.3.1 the distance s measured along the curve from
the point A to the point B is not the same as the length of the line segment AB joining A to B.

   y = f (x)                                                                      B

                  x

Figure 1.3.1 Curved real-valued distance s = length of AB, but infinitesimal s = length of AB

   However, as the points A and B get closer to each other, the difference between that part of
the curve joining A to B and the line segment AB becomes less noticeable. That is, the curve
is almost linear when A and B are close. The Microstraightness Property simply goes one step
further and says that the curve actually is linear when the distance s between the points is
infinitesimal (so that s equals the length of AB at the infinitesimal level).

   At first this might seem nonsensical. After all, how could any nonstraight part of a curve
be straight? You have to remember that an infinitesimal is an abstraction--it does not exist
physically. A curve y = f (x) is also an abstraction, which exists in a purely mathematical sense,
so its geometric properties at the "normal" scale do not have to match those at the infinitesimal
scale (which can be defined in any way, provided the properties at that scale are consistent).

This abstraction finally reveals what an instantaneous rate of change y

is: the average rate of change over an infinitesimal interval. Moving             y = f (x)
an infinitesimal amount dx away from a value x produces an infinites-                              dy

imal change dy in a differentiable function y = f (x). The average rate                 dx x
of change of y = f (x) over the infinitesimal interval [x, x+dx] is thus dx dy ,     x x + dx
i.e. the slope--rise over run--of the straight line segment represented
by the curve y = f (x) over that interval, as in the figure on the right.20

20Notice that the figure implies that the Pythagorean Theorem does not apply to infinitesimal triangles. This will
be discussed in Chapter 8.
18 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                                 §1.3

   The Microstraightness Property can be extended to smooth curves--that is, curves without
sharp edges or cusps. For example, circles and ellipses are smooth, but polygons are not.

   The properties of infinitesimals can be applied to determine the derivatives of the sine and
cosine functions. Consider a circle of radius 1 with center O and points A and B on the circle
such that the line segment AB is a diameter. Let C be a point on the circle such that the angle
 BAC has an infinitesimal measure dx (in radians) as in Figure 1.3.2(a).

         C                                                         C

                                                       A dx1  O1                 B

    Figure 1.3.2 Circle O: BC = 2 sin dx,  BOC = 2  B AC

By Thales' Theorem from elementary geometry, the angle  ACB is a right angle. Thus:

                                    sin dx = BC AB = BC 2  BC = 2 sin dx
Figure 1.3.2(b) shows that  OAC +  OC A +  AOC = . Thus, 1 = OC = OA   OC A =
 OAC = dx   AOC =  - dx - dx =  - 2dx   BOC = 2dx. By the arc length formula from
trigonometry, the length s of the arc BC along the circle from B to C is the radius times the
central angle  BOC: s = BC = 1 · 2dx = 2dx. But by Microstraightness, BC = BC, and thus:

    2 sin dx = BC = BC = 2dx  sin dx = dx

Since dx is an infinitesimal, (dx)2 = 0. So since sin2 dx + cos2 dx = 1, then:

    cos2 dx = 1 - sin2 dx = 1 - (dx)2 = 1 - 0 = 1  cos dx = 1

The derivative of y = sin x is then:

d (sin x) = dy = sin(x + dx) - sin x
dx  dx                                dx

    = (sin x cos dx + sin dx cos x) - sin x by the sine addition formula
                              dx

       (sin x)(1) + dx cos x - sinx dx cos x                  , and thus:
    = dx = dx

                                          d (sin x) = cos x
                                          dx
                          The Derivative: Infinitesimal Approach · Section 1.3 19

   A similar argument (left as an exercise) using the cosine addition formula shows:

                                                     d (cos x) = - sin x
                                                    dx

   One of the intermediate results proved here bears closer examination. Namely, sin dx = dx
for an infinitesimal angle dx measured in radians. At first, it might seem that this cannot be
true. After all, an infinitesimal dx is thought of as being infinitely close to 0, and sin 0 = 0, so
you might expect that sin dx = 0. But this is not the case. The formula sin dx = dx says that in
an infinitesimal interval around 0, the function y = sin x is identical to the line y = x (not the
line y = 0). This, in turn, suggests that for real-valued x close to 0, sin x  x.

   This indeed turns out to be the case. The free graphing software Gnuplot21 can display the
graphs of y = sin x and y = x. Figure 1.3.3(a) below shows how those graphs compare over the
interval [-, ]. Outside the interval [-1, 1] there is a noticeable difference.

         Figure 1.3.3 sin dx = dx: Comparing y = sin x and y = x near x = 0

   Figure 1.3.3(b) shows that there is virtually no difference in the graphs even over the non-
infinitesimal interval [-0.3, 0.3]. So sin x  x is a good approximation when x is close to 0, that
is, when |x|  1 (the symbol  means "much less than"). This approximation is used in many
applications in engineering and physics when the angle x is assumed to be small.

   Notice something else suggested by the relation sin dx = dx: there is a fundamental differ-
ence at the infinitesimal level between a line of slope 1 (y = x) and a line of slope 0 (y = 0). In a
real interval (-a, a) around x = 0 the difference between the two lines can be made as small as
desired by choosing a > 0 small enough. But in an infinitesimal interval (-, ) around x = 0
there is unbridgeable gulf between the two lines. This is the crucial difference in sin dx being
equal to dx rather than 0.

   Notice also that the value of a function at an infinitesimal may itself be an infinitesimal (e.g.

sin dx = dx) or a real number (e.g. cos dx = 1).

   For  a  differentiable     function  f (x),  df  =  f (x)  and  so  multiplying  both  sides  by  dx  yields  the
                                                dx
important relation:

                                                    df = f (x) dx                                        (1.9)

Note that both sides of the above equation are infinitesimals for each value of x in the domain
of f , since f (x) would then be a real number.

   The notion of an infinitesimal was fairly radical at the time (and still is). Some mathemati-
cians embraced it, e.g. the outstanding Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783),
who produced a large amount of work using infinitesimals. But it was too radical for many
mathematicians (and philosophers22), enough so that by the 19th century some mathemati-
cians (notably Augustin Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass) felt the need to put calculus on what
they considered a more "rigorous" footing, based on limits.23 Yet it was precisely the notion of
an infinitesimal which lent calculus its modern character, by showing the power and usefulness
of such an abstraction (especially one that did not obey the rules of classical mathematics).

22The English philosopher George Berkeley (1685-1753) famously derided infinitesimals as "the ghosts of departed
quantities" in his book The Analyst (1734), which had the disquieting subtitle "A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel
Mathematician" (directed at Newton).
23However, the limit approach turns out, ultimately, to be equivalent to the infinitesimal approach. In essence,
only the terminology is different.

1.4 Derivatives of Sums, Products and Quotients

So far the derivatives of only a few simple functions have been calculated. The following rules
will make it easier to calculate derivatives of more functions:

Rules for Derivatives: Suppose that f and g are differentiable functions of x. Then:

    Sum Rule: d ( f + g) = df + dg
                                dx    dx dx

    Difference Rule: d ( f - g) = df - dg
                                dx    dx dx

Constant Multiple Rule: d (c f ) = c · df for any constant c
                                dx    dx

    Product Rule: d ( f · g) = f · dg + g · df
                                dx    dx     dx

                                df    g · dx df - f · dx dg
    Quotient Rule:                    =2
                                dx g      g

The above rules can be written using the prime notation for derivatives:

                     Sum Rule:  ( f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x)
           Difference Rule:     ( f - g)(x) = f (x) - g(x)
Constant Multiple Rule:         (c f )(x) = c · f (x) for any constant c
                                ( f · g)(x) = f (x) · g(x) + g(x) · f (x)
               Product Rule:
                                  f  g (x) = (g(x))2 g(x) · f (x) - f (x) · g(x)
              Quotient Rule:

The proof of the Sum Rule is straightforward. Since dx df and dx dg both exist then:

d ( f + g) = ( f + g)(x + dx) - ( f + g)(x) = f (x + dx) + g(x + dx) - ( f (x) + g(x))
dx             dx                                            dx

    = f (x + dx) - f (x) + g(x + dx) - g(x) = f (x + dx) - f (x) + g(x + dx) - g(x)
                                dx                           dx                       dx

        df dg
    = dx + dx

The proofs of the Difference and Constant Multiple Rules are similar and are left as exercises.
22 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                                     §1.4

   Note that by the Product Rule, in general the derivative of a product is not the product of
the derivatives. That is, dx d(f ·g) = dx df · dx dg . This should be obvious from some earlier examples. For
instance, if f (x) = x and g(x) = 1 then ( f · g)(x) = x · 1 = x so that dx d(f ·g) = 1, but dx df · dx dg = 1 · 0 = 0.

   There is a proof of the Product Rule similar to the proof of the Sum Rule (see Exercise 20),
but there is a more geometric way of seeing why the formula holds, described below.

   Construct a rectangle whose perpendicular sides                         g(x + dx)
have lengths f (x) and g(x) for some x, as in the draw- df
ing on the right. Change x by some infinitesimal                                                        f (x + dx)
amount dx, which produces infinitesimal changes df
and dg in f (x) and g(x), respectively. Assume those f (x)                 g(x)                   dg
changes are positive and extend the original rectan-
gle by those amounts, creating a larger rectangle with
perpendicular sides f (x + dx) and g(x + dx). Then

             d( f · g) = ( f · g)(x + dx) - ( f · g)(x)

               = f (x + dx) · g(x + dx) - f (x) · g(x)

               = (area of outer rectangle) - (area of original rectangle)

               = sum of the areas of the three shaded inner rectangles

               = f (x) · dg + g(x) · df + df · dg

               = f (x) · dg + g(x) · df + ( f (x) dx) · (g(x) dx)
               = f (x) · dg + g(x) · df + ( f (x)g(x)) · (dx)2

               = f (x) · dg + g(x) · df + ( f (x)g(x)) · 0

           d( f · g) = f (x) · dg + g(x) · df , so dividing both sides by dx yields

           d( f · g) = f (x) · dg + g(x) · df
           dx        dx           dx

   To prove the Quotient Rule, let y = gf , so f = g · y. If y were a differentiable function of x,
then the Product Rule would give

   df = d(g · y) = g · dy + y · dg = g · dy + f · dg  g · dy = df - f · dg
   dx          dx            dx   dx           dx g dx                     dx dx g dx

and so dividing both sides by g and getting a common denominator gives

                     dy 1 df                   f dg g · dx df - f · dx dg

A  simple  mnemonic  device  for  remembering  the  Quotient   Rule  is:   write  f  as  HI --so  that  HI
                                                                                  g
                                                                                         HO
represents the "high" (numerator) part of the quotient and HO represents the "low" (denomi-

nator) part--and think of dHI and dHO as the derivatives of HI and HO, respectively. Then

d f dx g = HO·dHI - HO2HI·dHO , pronounced as "ho-dee-hi minus hi-dee-ho over ho-ho."

Solution:  Since  tan  x=  sin x  then:
                           cos x

d (tan x) = d          sin x      (cos   x) ·  d   (sin  x)    -   (sin   x) ·    d   (cos  x)  (cos x) · (cos x) - (sin x) · (- sin x)

Solution:  Since  sec  x=    1    then:
                           cos x

           d (sec x) = d            1              (cos  x) ·  d   (1)  -     1·  d   (cos  x)  (cos x) · 0 - 1 · (- sin x)

   Similar to the above examples, the derivatives of cot x and csc x can be found using the
Quotient Rule (left as exercises). The derivatives of all six trigonometric functions are:

                     d (cos x) = - sin x                                          d (sec x) = sec x tan x
                    dx                                                            dx
                     d (sin x) = cos x                                            d (csc x) = - csc x cot x
                    dx                                                            dx
                    d (tan x) = sec2 x                                            d (cot x) = - csc2 x
                    dx                                                            dx

   Note that the Sum and Difference Rules can be applied to sums and differences, respectively,
of not just two functions but any finite (integer) number of functions. For example, for three
differentiable functions f1, f2, and f3,

                    d (f1 + f2 + f3) = df1 + d (f2 + f3)                              by the Sum Rule
                    dx                             dx dx                              by the Sum Rule again.

                                         = df1 + df2 + df3
                                             dx dx dx

Continuing like this for four functions, then five functions, and so forth, the Sum and Differ-
ence Rules combined with the Constant Multiple Rule yield the following formula:
24 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                                           §1.4

For n  1 differentiable functions f1, . . ., fn and constants c1, . . ., cn:

                    d (c1 f1 + ··· + cn fn) = c1 df1 + ··· + cn dfn                                     (1.10)
                    dx                                         dx                 dx

Note that the above formula includes differences, by using negative constants. The formula

also shows that differentiation is a linear operation, which makes                d   a linear operator.  The
                                                                                  dx
idea  is  that  d   "operates"  on  differentiable  functions  by  taking  their  derivatives     with  respect  to
                dx
the variable x. The sum c1 f1 + · · · + cn fn is called a linear combination of functions, and the

derivative of that linear combination can be taken term by term, with the constant multiples

taken outside the derivatives.

A special case of the above formula is replacing the functions f1, . . ., fn by nonnegative

powers of x, making the sum a polynomial in x. In previous sections the derivatives of a few
polynomials--such as x and x2--were calculated. For the derivative of a general polynomial,

the following rule is needed:

                    Power Rule: d xn = n xn-1 for any integer n
                                          dx

There are several ways to prove this formula; one such way being a proof by induction,
which in general means using the following principle:24

Principle of Mathematical Induction
A statement P(n) about integers n  k is true for all n  k if:
1. P(k) is true.

2. If P(n) is true for some integer n  k then P(n + 1) is true.

The idea behind mathematical induction is simple: if a statement is true about some initial

integer k (Step 1 above) and if the statement being true for some integer implies it is true for

the next integer (Step 2 above), then the statement being true for k implies it is true for k + 1,

which in turn implies it is true for k + 2, which implies it is true for k + 3, and so forth, making

it true for all integers n  k.

Typically the initial integer k will be 0 or 1. To prove the Power Rule for all integers, first

use induction to prove the rule for all nonnegative integers n  0, using k = 0 for the initial
                                                                                         n xn-1.
integer.  For the proof by induction, let P(n) be the statement:           d   (xn)   =
                                                                           dx

1. Show that P(0) is true.                                                            x0  = 0 x0-1 = 0. But

That means showing that the Power Rule holds for n = 0, i.e.                      d
x0 = 1 is a constant, so its derivative is 0.                                     dx

24As Bertrand Russell noted, the name is really a misnomer: it is actually a definition of the natural numbers
rather than a principle, and induction technically has a different meaning.
                    Derivatives of Sums, Products and Quotients · Section 1.4 25

2. Assuming P(n) is true for some n  0, show that P(n + 1) is true.
Assuming that ddx (xn) = n xn-1, show that ddx xn+1 = (n + 1) x(n+1)-1 = (n + 1) xn. It was
shown  in  Section  1.2  that  d   (x) = 1,  so:
                               dx

           d xn+1 = d x · xn
           dx            dx

                         = x · d xn + xn · d (x) (by the Product Rule)
                               dx                 dx

                         = x · n xn-1 + xn · 1 (by the assumption that P(n) is true)

                                  = n xn + xn = (n + 1) xn
Thus, by induction, the Power Rule is true for all nonnegative integers n  0.

   To show that the Power Rule is true for all negative integers n < 0, write n = -m, where m

is positive (namely, m = |n|). Then:

ddx xn = ddx x-m = dx xm d 1                     xm · ddx (1) - 1 · ddx (xm)  (by the Quotient Rule)
                                             = (xm)2

               xm · 0 - 1 · m xm-1  (by the Power Rule for positive integers)
           = x2m

           = -m xm-1-2m = -m x-m-1 = n xn-1

Thus, the Power Rule is true for all integers, which completes the proof. QED

                    = 4x3 - 12x2 + 12x - 4

In general, the derivative of a polynomial of degree n  0 is given by:
For any constants a0, . . ., an with n  0:
 d an xn + an-1xn-1 · · · + a2x2 + a1x + a0 = nan xn-1 + (n-1) an-1xn-2 + · · · + 2a2x + a1

   A way to remember the Power Rule is: bring the exponent down in front of the variable then
reduce the variable's original exponent by 1. This works even for negative exponents.

1.5 The Chain Rule

From what has been discussed so far it might be tempting to think that the derivative of a
function like sin 2x is simply cos 2x, since the derivative of sin x is cos x. It turns out that is
not correct:

          d (sin 2x) = d (2 sin x cos x) (by the double-angle formula for sine)
          dx             dx

                         = 2 d (sin x cos x) (by the Constant Multiple Rule)
                               dx

                         = 2 sin x · d (cos x) + cos x · d (sin x)        (by the Product Rule)
                                       dx                     dx

                         = 2 (sin x · (- sin x) + cos x · cos x)

                         = 2 cos2 x - sin2 x

                         = 2 cos 2x (by the double-angle formula for cosine)

So the derivative of sin 2x is 2 cos 2x, not cos 2x.

In other words, you cannot simply replace x by 2x in the derivative formula for sin x. Instead,

regard sin 2x as a composition of two functions: the sine function and the 2x function. That is,

let f (u) = sin u, where the variable u itself represents a function of another variable x, namely

u(x) = 2x. So since f is a function of u, and u is a function of x, then f is a function of x, namely:

f (x) = sin 2x. Since f is a differentiable function of u, and u is a differentiable function of x,

then  df  and  du  both  exist  (with  df  = cos  u  and  du  = 2),  and  multiplying  the  derivatives  shows
      du       dx                      du                 dx
that f is a differentiable function of x:

                         df du df          since the infinitesimals du cancel, so
                         du · dx = dx

                   (cos u) · 2 = df  df = 2 cos u = 2 cos 2x
                                       dx            dx

The above argument holds in general, and is known as the Chain Rule:

Chain Rule: If f is a differentiable function of u, and u is a differentiable function of x,
then f is a differentiable function of x, and its derivative with respect to x is:

                                                     df df du
                                                     dx = du · dx

Notice how simple the proof is--the infinitesimals du cancel.25

25Some textbooks give dire warnings to not think that du is an actual quantity that can be canceled. However, you
can safely ignore those warnings, because du is just an infinitesimal and hence can be canceled!
28 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                                                     §1.5

The Chain Rule should make sense intuitively. For example, if du df = 4 then that means f is
increasing  4  times  as  fast  as  u,  and  if  du  =3  then     is  increasing  3  times  as  fast  as  x,  so  overall
                                                 dx            u

f should be increasing 12 = 4 · 3 times as fast as x, exactly as the Chain Rule says.

Example 1.9

Find the derivative of f (x) = sin (x2 + x + 1).
Solution: The idea is to make a substitution u = x2 + x + 1 so that f (x) = sin u. By the Chain Rule,

                                        df df du
                                        dx = du · dx

                                             = d (sin u) · d (x2 + x + 1)
                                                 du            dx

                                             = (cos u) · (2x + 1)

                                             = (2x + 1) cos (x2 + x + 1)

after replacing u by its definition as a function of x in the last step; the final answer for the derivative
should be in terms of x, not u.

   In the Chain Rule you can think of the function in question as the composition of an "outer"
function f and an "inner" function u; first take the derivative of the "outer" function then
multiply by the derivative of the "inner" function. Think of the "inner" function as a box into
which you can put any function of x, and the "outer" function being a function of that empty
box.

   For instance, for the function f (x) = sin(x2 + x + 1) in the previous example, think of the
"outer" function as sin , where  = x2 + x + 1 is the "inner" function, so that

                                    f (x) = sin (x2 + x + 1)

                                        = sin 

                                    df = (cos ) · d 
                                    dx                   dx

                                        = cos x2 + x + 1 · d x2 + x + 1
                                                                   dx

                                        = (2x + 1) cos (x2 + x + 1)

Example 1.10

Find the derivative of f (x) = (2x4 - 3 cos x)10.
Solution: Here the "outer" function is f () = 10 and the "inner" function is  = u = 2x4 - 3 cos x:

               df = df · du = 10 9 · d () = 10 (2x4 - 3 cos x)9 (8x3 + 3 sin x)

   Recall that the composition f  g of two functions f and g is defined as ( f  g)(x) = f (g(x)).
Using prime notation the Chain Rule can be written as:

  Chain Rule: If g is a differentiable function of x, and f is a differentiable function on the
  range of g, then f  g is a differentiable function of x, and its derivative with respect to x is:

                                              ( f  g)(x) = f (g(x)) · g(x)

   Using the Chain Rule, the Power Rule can be extended to include exponents that are rational
numbers:26

                          d xr = r xr-1 for any rational number r
                          dx

To prove this, let r = m/n, where m and n are integers with n = 0. Then y = xr = xm/n = (xm)1/n,
so that yn = xm. Taking the derivative with respect to x of both sides of this equation gives

              d yn = d xm               , so evaluating the left side by the Chain Rule gives
              dx          dx

           n yn-1 · dy = mxm-1
                      dx

n xm/n n-1 · dy = mxm-1
                  dx

                  dy      mxm-1         = m xm-1-(m-(m/n)) = m x(m/n)-1 = r xr-1

Example 1.11
Find the derivative of f (x) = x.
Solution: Since x = x1/2 then by the Power Rule:

                                        dfdx = ddx x1/2 = 12 x1/2-1 = 12 x-1/2 = 1 2 x

Example 1.12

Find the derivative of f (x) = 3 2 x .

Solution:                 df d          2 x-1/2  = 23 · -12 x-3/2 = - 1 3 x3/2
                          dx = dx       3

26It will be shown in Chapter 2 how to define any real number as an exponent. The Power Rule extends to that
case as well.

1.6 Higher Order Derivatives

The derivative f (x) of a differentiable function f (x) can be thought of as a function in its
own right, and if it is differentiable then its derivative--denoted by f (x)--is the second
derivative of f (x) (the first derivative being f (x)). Likewise, the derivative of f (x) would
be the third derivative of f (x), written as f (x). Continuing like this yields the fourth
derivative, fifth derivative, and so on. In general the n-th derivative of f (x) is obtained
by differentiating f (x) a total of n times. Derivatives beyond the first are called higher order
derivatives.

Example 1.13

For f (x) = 3x4 find f (x) and f (x).
Solution: Since f (x) = 12x3 then the second derivative f (x) is the derivative of 12x3, namely:

                                                              f (x) = 36x2
The third derivative f (x) is then the derivative of 36x2, namely:

                                                               f (x) = 72x

   Since the prime notation for higher order derivatives can be cumbersome (e.g. writing 50
prime marks for the fiftieth derivative), other notations have been created:

Notation for the second derivative of y = f (x): The following are all equivalent:

f (x) , f (2)(x) , 2 d2 y ,  d2  (2) ¨ d2 f 2
                               2 ( f (x)) , y , y , y¨ , f (x) , 2 , D f (x)
dx                           dx           dx

Notation for the n-th derivative of y = f (x): The following are all equivalent:

f (n)(x) , dxn dn y , dxn dn ( f (x)) , y(n) , dxn dn f , Dn f (x)

   Notice that the parentheses around n in the notation f (n)(x) indicate that n is not an exponent--
it is the number of derivatives to take. The n in the Leibniz notation dxn dn y indicates the same
thing, and in general makes working with higher order derivatives easier:

    d2 y d dy
    dx2 = dx dx

    d3y d d2y                    d2 dy
    dx3 = dx dx2 = dx2 dx

                             ..
                             .

    dn y d dn-1 y                dn-1 dy
    dxn = dx dxn-1 = dxn-1 dx
                                           Higher Order Derivatives · Section 1.6 33

   A natural question to ask is: what do higher order derivatives represent? Recall that the
first derivative f (x) represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function f (x) at the value
x. So the second derivative f (x) represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function
f (x) at the value x. In other words, the second derivative is a rate of change of a rate of change.

The most famous example of this is for motion in a straight line:          s<0       s>0

let s(t) be the position of an object at time t as the object moves along       s=0

the line. The motion can take two directions, e.g. forward/backward

or up/down. Take one direction to represent positive position and the other to represent neg-

ative direction, as in the drawing on the right. The (instantaneous) velocity v(t) of the object

at time t is s(t), i.e. the first derivative of s(t). The acceleration a(t) of the object at time

t is defined as v(t), the instantaneous rate of change of the velocity. Thus, a(t) = s(t), i.e.

acceleration is the second derivative of position. To summarize:

                                s(t) = position at time t

                                v(t) = velocity at time t
                                      = ds = s(t) = s(t)
                                          dt

                                a(t) = acceleration at time t
                                      = dv = v(t) = v(t)
                                          dt

Example 1.14

Ignoring wind and air resistance, the position s of a ball thrown straight up with an initial velocity of
34 m/s from a starting point 2 m off the ground is given by s(t) = -4.9t2 + 34t + 2 at time t (measured in
seconds) with s measured in meters. Find the velocity and acceleration of the ball at any time t  0.
Solution: The ball moves in a straight vertical line, first straight up then straight down until it hits the
ground. Its velocity v(t) is

v(t) = ds = -9.8t + 34 m/s
          dt

while its acceleration a(t) is

a(t) = 2 d = = 2s d ds d (-9.8t + 34) = -9.8 m/s2,
                                dt  dt dt  dt

which is the acceleration due to the force of gravity on Earth.
Note that time t = 0 is the time at which the ball was thrown, so that v(0) is the initial velocity of the
ball. Indeed, v(0) = -9.8(0) + 34 = 34 m/s, as expected.
34 Chapter 1 · The Derivative                                                      §1.6

   Notice in Example 1.14 that the acceleration of the ball is not   t = 3.47
only constant but also negative. To see why this makes sense,         v=0

first consider the case where the ball is moving upward. The         v>0      v<0
ball has an initial upward velocity of 34 m/s then slows down        a<0      a<0
to 0 m/s at the instant it reaches its maximum height above the
ground. So the velocity is decreasing, i.e. its rate of change--the  s=2
acceleration--is negative.                                           t=0

   The ball reaches its maximum height above the ground when its s = 0
velocity is zero, that is, when v(t) = -9.8t + 34 = 0, i.e. at time t =

34/9.8 = 3.47 seconds after being thrown (see the picture above). The ball then starts moving

downward and its velocity is negative (e.g. at time t = 4 s the velocity is v(4) = -9.8(4) + 34 =

-5.2 m/s). Recall that negative velocity indicates downward motion, while positive velocity

means the motion is upward (away from the Earth's center). So in the case where the ball

begins moving downward it goes from 0 m/s to a negative velocity, with the ball moving faster

towards the ground, which it hits with a velocity of -33.43 m/s (why?). So again the velocity is

decreasing, which again means that the acceleration is negative.

Common terminology involving motion might cause some confusion with the above discus-

sion. For example, even though the ball's acceleration is negative as it falls to the ground, it

is common to say that the ball is accelerating in that situation, not decelerating (as the ball is

doing while moving upward). In general, acceleration is understood to mean that the mag-

nitude (i.e. the absolute value) of the velocity is increasing. That magnitude is called the

speed of the object. Deceleration means the speed is decreasing.

The first and second derivatives of an object's position with respect to time represent the

object's velocity and acceleration, respectively. Do the third, fourth, and other higher order

derivatives have any physical meanings? It turns out they do. The third derivative of posi-

tion is called the jerk of the object. It represents the rate of change of acceleration, and is

often used in fields such as vehicle dynamics (e.g. minimizing jerk to provide smoother brak-

ing). The fourth, fifth, and sixth derivatives of position are called snap, crackle, and pop,
respectively.29

   The zero-th derivative f (0)(x) of a function f (x) is defined to be the function f (x) itself:
f (0)(x) = f (x). There is a way to define fractional derivatives, e.g. the one-half derivative
f (1/2)(x), which will be discussed in Chapter 6.

An immediate consequence of the definition of higher order derivatives is:

dxm+n dm+n ( f (x)) = dxm dxn dm dn ( f (x)) for all integers m  0 and n  0.

   Recall that the factorial n! of an integer n > 0 is the product of the integers from 1 to n:

                                                    n! = 1 · 2 · 3 · ··· · n

29Yes, those really are their names, obviously inspired by a certain breakfast cereal. Snap has found some uses in
flight dynamics, e.g. minimizing snap to optimize flight paths of drones.

                            1! = 1               3! = 1 · 2 · 3 = 6
                            2! = 1 · 2 = 2       4! = 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 = 24

By convention 0! is defined to be 1. The following statement can be proved using induction:

                            d (xn) = n n !    for all integers n  0
                            dxn

Thus,                       ddxn+1 x n+1 n = d d dx dxn x n n

                                                               = d (n!) = 0
                                                                   dx

for all integers n  0, since n! is a constant. Polynomials are linear combinations of nonnegative
powers of a variable (e.g. x), so the above result combined with the Sum Rule and the Constant
Multiple rule--which also hold for higher-order derivatives--yields this important fact:

The (n + 1)-st derivative ("n plus first derivative") of a polynomial of degree n is 0:
For any polynomial p(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn of degree n, n+1 dn+1 (p(x)) = 0.

                                                                                                  dx

This is the basis for the commonly-used statement that "any polynomial can be differentiated
to 0" by taking a sufficient number of derivatives. For example, differentiating the polynomial
p(x) = 100x100 + 50x99 101 times would yield 0 (as would differentiating more than 101 times).

                    CHAPTER 2

Derivatives of Common Functions

2.1 Inverse Functions

The derivatives calculated in the previous chapter were mostly for polynomials and a few
trigonometric functions. This chapter will show how to find the derivatives of other types of
functions, beginning in this section with inverse functions. The idea here is that if a function
is differentiable and has an inverse then that inverse function is also differentiable.

   Recall that a function is a rule that assigns a single object      Domain      f      Range
y from one set (the range) to each object x from another set              x   y = f (x)     y
(the domain). That rule can be written as y = f (x), where f is
the function (see Figure 2.1.1). There is a simple vertical rule for  Figure 2.1.1
determining whether a rule y = f (x) is a function: f is a function
if and only if every vertical line intersects the graph of y = f (x)
in the x y-coordinate plane at most once (see Figure 2.1.2).

y                                    y

                       y = f (x)        y = f (x)

                                  x                                           x

   (a) f is a function                  (b) f is not a function

   Figure 2.1.2 Vertical rule for functions

   Recall that a function f is one-to-one (often written as 1 - 1) if it assigns distinct values

of y to distinct values of x. In other words, if x1 = x2 then f (x1) = f (x2). Equivalently, f is
one-to-one if f (x1) = f (x2) implies x1 = x2. There is a simple horizontal rule for determining
whether a function y = f (x) is one-to-one: f is one-to-one if and only if every horizontal line

intersects the graph of y = f (x) in the x y-coordinate plane at most once (see Figure 2.1.3).

                                                                                         37
38 Chapter 2 · Derivatives of Common Functions                                                           §2.1

                                        y = f (x)                      y = f (x)

                                                   x                                   x

                       (a) f is one-to-one                    (b) f is not one-to-one

                            Figure 2.1.3 Horizontal rule for one-to-one functions

   If a function f is one-to-one on its domain, then f has an inverse function, denoted by f -1,
such that y = f (x) if and only if f -1(y) = x. The domain of f -1 is the range of f .

   The basic idea is that f -1 "undoes" what f does, and vice versa. In other words,

                            f -1( f (x)) = x   for all x in the domain of f , and
                            f ( f -1(y)) = y   for all y in the range of f .

Intuitively it is clear that a function is one-to-one (and hence invertible) when it is either

strictly increasing or strictly decreasing; if the function, say, increases and then decreases (as

in Figure 2.1.3(b)) then the horizontal rule would be violated around that "turning point." For

differentiable functions a positive derivative means the function is increasing, while a negative

derivative means the function is decreasing (this will be proved in Chapter 3).

However, a function can still be one-to-one even if its derivative is zero only at isolated points

(i.e. not identically zero over an entire interval of points) and either positive everywhere else
or negative everywhere else. For example, the function f (x) = x3 has derivative f (x) = 3x2,

which is zero only at the isolated point x = 0 and positive for all other values of x. Clearly

f is one-to-one over the set of all real numbers (why?) and hence it has an inverse function
x = f -1(y) = 3 y defined for all real numbers y (i.e. the range of f ).

Thus, having a derivative that is either always positive or always negative is sufficient for a

function to be one-to-one but not necessary. Having a nonzero derivative is necessary, though,

for the inverse function to be differentiable.
                                           1
In algebra you learned that  a          =     for all real numbers     a = 0 and    b = 0 (and hence  b  = 0).
                             b             b                                                          a

                                           a
The same holds true for the infinitesimals dy and dx (nonzero by definition) since they can

be treated like numbers, which immediately yields a formula for the derivative of an inverse

function:

Derivative of an Inverse Function: If y = f (x) is differentiable and has an inverse
function x = f -1(y), then f -1 is differentiable and its derivative is

                                           dx 1            if dy = 0.
                                           dy = dy             dx

                                                       dx

The inverse of a function would still exist at a point where dx dy = 0 but it would not be differen-
tiable  there,  since  its  derivative  would  be  the     undefined  quantity  1

                                                                                0.

Since y is a function of x, dx dy will be in terms of x and hence dy1 will be in terms of x. However,
                                                                         dx
since  (by  invertibility)      is  a  function  of  y,  dx  would  normally  be  in  terms  of  y,  not  x,  so  that
                             x                           dy

the  two  sides  of  the  equation     dx    =   1   are not in the same terms!       One way to handle this
                                       dy
                                                 dy

                                                 dx
discrepancy is to use the formula y = f (x) to solve for x in terms of y then substitute that
                                             1
expression into  dx dy , so that    dy dx =      is now in terms of  y.  That might not always be possible,
                                             dy

                                             dx
however (e.g. try solving for x in the formula y = x sin x).

Example 2.1

Find the inverse f -1 of the function f (x) = x3 then find the derivative of f -1.
Solution: The function y = f (x) = x3 is one-to-one over the set of all real numbers (why?) so it has an
inverse function x = f -1(y) defined for all real numbers, namely x = f -1(y) = 3 y.
The derivative of f -1 is

             dx 1               1      , which is in terms of x, so putting it in terms of y yields
             dy = dy = 3x2
                     dx

                          1            1
                 = 3 3 y 2 = 3 y2/3

which agrees with the derivative obtained by differentiating x = 3 y directly. Note that this derivative
is defined for all y except y = 0, which occurs when x = 3 0 = 0, i.e. at the point (x, y) = (0,0).

   Functions are often expressed in terms of x, so it is common to see an inverse function also
expressed in terms of x: writing the inverse of f (x) = x3 as f -1(x) = 3 x (not as f -1(y) = 3 y)),
as confusing as that might be. In that case, the idea is to switch the roles of x and y in the
original function y = f (x), making it x = f (y), and then write y = f -1(x) and use

                                                           dy 1
                                                           dx = dx

                                                                                          dy

to put the derivative of f -1 in terms of x, following the same procedure mentioned earlier.

Example 2.2

Find the inverse f -1 of the function f (x) = x3 then find the derivative of f -1.

Solution: Rewrite y = f (x) = x3 as x = f (y) = y3, so that its inverse function y = f -1(x) = 3 x has deriva-
tive

             dy 1               1      , which is in terms of y, so putting it in terms of x yields
             dx = dx = 3y2
                     dy

                          1            1
                 = 3 3 x 2 = 3x2/3

which agrees with the derivative obtained by differentiating y = 3 x directly.

                               f -1  ( f (x)) = f 1(x) if f (x) = 0
    Two equivalent ways to write this are:

                                   f -1  (c) = f 1(a) where c = f (a) and f (a) = 0
    and

                                   f -1  (x) = f ( f -1 1 (x)) if f ( f -1(x)) = 0

A

For Exercises 1-8, show that the given function y = f (x) is one-to-one over the given interval, then find
the formulas for the inverse function f -1 and its derivative. Use Example 2.2 as a guide, including
putting f -1 and its derivative in terms of x.

1. f (x) = x, for all x                        2. f (x) = 3x, for all x

3. f (x) = x2, for all x  0                    4. f (x) = x, for all x  0

5.  f  (x)  =  1  ,  for  all  x  >  0         6.  f  (x)  =  1  ,  for  all                x  <  0

               x2

9. The unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 does not define y as a single function of x, since y = ± 1 - x2 defines two
    separate functions. But the part of the unit circle in the first quadrant, i.e. for 0  x  1 and 0  y  1,
    does define y = f (x) = 1 - x2 as a single function of x that is one-to-one on the interval [0,1]. Find

Recall that sin x, cos x, csc x, and sec x have a period of 2 (i.e. repeat the same values every
2 radians), while tan x and cot x have a period of .

The derivatives of the six trigonometric functions--given in Section 1.4--are:

            d (sin x) = cos x                     d (csc x) = - csc x cot x
           dx                                     dx
            d (cos x) = - sin x                   d (sec x) = sec x tan x
           dx                                     dx
           d (tan x) = sec2 x                     d (cot x) = - csc2 x
           dx                                     dx

   The six trigonometric functions are not one-to-one over their entire domains, but recall from
trigonometry that they are one-to-one when restricted to smaller domains, and hence have
inverse functions, called the inverse trigonometric functions.

For example, y = sin x is one-to-one over the interval         , as shown in Figure 2.2.2 below:

Similarly, recall that cos x is one-to-one over [0, ], tan x is one-to-one over (-/2, /2), csc x
is one-to-one over (-/2, 0)  (0, /2), sec x is one-to-one over (0, /2)  (/2, ), and cot x is one-
to-one over (0, ). Hence, the inverse trigonometric functions sin-1 x, cos-1 x, tan-1 x, csc-1 x,
sec-1 x and cot-1 x are defined,1 with the following domains and ranges:

The derivatives of the six inverse trigonometric functions are:

     d (sin-1 x) =         1          (for |x| < 1)                d (csc-1 x) = - 1                (for |x| > 1)

     d (cos-1 x) = -       1          (for |x| < 1)                d (sec-1 x) = 1               (for |x| > 1)
     dx                   1 - x2                               dx                    |x| x2 - 1

     ddx (tan-1 x) = 1 + x2 1                                  ddx (cot-1 x) = - 1 + x2 1

For the derivative of cos-1 x, recall that y = cos-1 x is an angle between 0 and  radians, defined

for  -1   x  1.    Since  cos y =  x  by  the  definition  of  y,  then  dx  = - sin y  and
                                                                         dy

                   sin2 y = 1 - cos2 y = 1 - x2  sin y = ± 1 - x2 = 1 - x2

since 0  y   (which means sin y must be nonnegative). Thus:

                          ddx (cos-1 x) = dy dx = dx1 = 1 - sin y = -                 1
                                                                                     1 - x2
                                                                 dy

   For the derivative of sec-1 x, since y = sec-1 x is defined for |x|  1, then 0  y < /2 for x  1
and /2 < y   for x  -1. Recall also that sec y and tan y are both positive when 0 < y < /2
and are both negative when /2 < y < . So in both cases the product sec y tan y is nonnegative,
i.e. sec y tan y = |sec y tan y|. Thus, since sec y = x and

1 + tan2 y = sec2 y  tan2 y = sec2 y - 1  tan y = ± sec2 y - 1 = ± x2 - 1

then for |x| > 1:

     d (sec-1 x) = dy = dx1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1
     dx             dx dy sec y tan y |sec y tan y| x x2 - 1 |x| x2 - 1

2.3 The Exponential and Natural Logarithm Functions

Functions of the form ax, where the exponent x varies, are called exponential functions. Unless
otherwise noted, assume that a > 0 (0x is just 0, and (-1)1/2 is not a real number). You already
know how ax is defined when the exponent x is a rational number (i.e. x = m/n where m and n
are integers, n = 0). But what if x were irrational, such as 2? What would 3 2 mean?

   The idea is that 2 = 1.414213562 . . . can be approximated by rational numbers 14/10 = 1.4,
141/100 = 1.41, 1414/1000 = 1.414, 14142/10000 = 1.4142, and so on, taking larger and larger
numerators and denominators in the rational approximations to get more and more decimal
places of 2. Then 3 2 would be the number that 3 raised to those rational approximations

                                                    3 2 = lim 3m/n

                                                                                                                  m/n 2
                                                                                                               m/n rational

Each quantity 3m/n is defined inside the above limit, and as the rational numbers m/n get
closer to the value of 2 it can be shown the limit of the values of 3m/n will exist:2

         1.4       14
      3 = 3 10              = 4.65553672174608

       1.41        141      = 4.70696500171657
      3         = 3 100

   31.414 = 3 11040104 = 4.72769503526854

    1.4142         14142
   3            = 3 10000 = 4.72873393017119

3  1.41421         141421
                = 3 100000 = 4.72878588090861

 1.414213          1414213
3               = 3 1000000 = 4.72880146624114

              ...              ...

31.414213562... = 3 2 = 4.72880438783742

Of course you would never do all this by hand--you would simply use a computer or calculator,
which use much more efficient algorithms for calculating powers in general.3

   All the usual rules of exponents that you learned in algebra apply to ax when defined in
the manner described above, with a > 0 and x varying over all real numbers. Of all the pos-
sible values for the base a, the one that appears the most in mathematics, the sciences and
engineering is the base e, defined as:

              e = lim 1 + 1 x                        (2.1)
                   x        x

The approximate value of is e = 2.71828182845905 . . . (often called the Euler number).

tions, Inc., 1964.

   The limit in this definition means that as x becomes larger--approaching infinity ()--the
values of 1 + x1 x approach a number, denoted by e. More decimal places for e can be obtained
by making x sufficiently large.4 For example, when x = 5×106 the value is 2.718281555200129.
For extremely large values of x, that is, when x  1 (the symbol  means "much larger than"),

e  1 + 1  e x 1/x  1 + 1 = 1 +  x 1/x 1                              e1/x - 1 x   1 x = 1,

so letting h = 1/x, and noting that h = 1/x  0 if and only if x  , yields the useful limit:5

                         lim e = h - 1 1                                                           (2.2)
                         h0 h

Using the above limit, the derivative of y = ex can be found:
                                                         d ex = ex
                                                         dx

Proof: Using the limit definition of the derivative for f (x) = ex,

d ex = lim f (x + h) - f (x) = lim ex+h - ex

In general, for a differentiable function u = u(x) as the exponent the Chain Rule yields:

Example 2.5

Find the derivative of y = 4e-x2 .
Solution: dx dy = 4e-x2 · dxd (-x2) = 4e-x2 · (-2x) = -8xe-x2

 4It will be shown in Chapter 9 that this limit does in fact exist.
 5This is admittedly a "hand waving" argument. In Chapter 3 a more exact method will be discussed for proving
limits like this one.

   The function ex is often referred to simply as the exponential function, even though there
are obviously many exponential functions. What makes the base e so special? Take y = A ekt to
represent the amount of some physical quantity at time t, for some constants A and k. Then

                                  dy = d A ekt = k · A ekt = k y ,
                                  dt dt

which says that the instantaneous rate of change of the quantity is directly proportional to

the amount present at that instant. It turns out that many physical quantities exhibit that

behavior, some of which will be discussed shortly. Conversely, in Chapter 5 it will be shown

that  any  solution      to  the  differential  equation      dy  = ky  must  be  of  the   form  y=  Aekt  for  some
                                                              dt
constant A. This is what gives the exponential function its special significance.

Let f (x) = ex be the exponential function. Then f (x) > 0 for all x and f (x) = f (x) = ex > 0 for

all x, and so f (x) is strictly increasing. The graph is shown in Figure 2.3.1.

           y                                                            y

   Thus, the exponential function is one-to-one over the set of all real numbers and hence has
an inverse function, called the natural logarithm function, denoted (as a function of x) as
f -1(x) = ln x. The graph is shown in Figure 2.3.2. Below is a summary of the relationship
between ex and ln x:

                             domain of ln x = all x > 0 = range of ex

The reader should be aware that many--if not most--fields outside of mathematics use the
notation log x instead of ln x for the natural logarithm function.6

 6This text almost used log x as well, prevented only by the desire for compatibility with other mathematics texts.

   From algebra you should be familiar with the following properties of the natural logarithm,
along with their equivalent properties in terms of the exponential function:7

        ln(ab) = ln a + ln b                                                    ea · eb = ea+b
        ln a = ln a - ln b                                                          ea = ea-b
                                                                                    eb
             b
          ln ab = b ln a                                                          ea b = eab
                                                                                    e0 = 1
           ln 1 = 0

To find the derivative of y = ln x, use x = e y:

            dy 1                                      1                  11
            dx = dx = d (e y) = e y = x
                                          dy      dy

Hence:

                                              d (ln x) = 1
                                              dx         x

In general, for a differentiable function u = u(x), the Chain Rule yields:

                                      d (ln u) = 1 · du = u
                                      dx              u dx u

Example 2.6

Find the derivative of y = ln x2 + 3x - 1 .
Solution: dy dx = x2 1 + 3x - 1 · ddx (x2 + 3x - 1) = x22x + 3 + 3x - 1

Recall that |x| = -x for x < 0, in which case ln(-x) is defined and

        d (ln|x|) = d (ln(-x)) = 1 · (-1) = 1 .
        dx                                dx                             -x     x

7Note that when using the formula ln  a   = ln a - ln b in numerical computations--especially on hand-held
                                      b

calculators--it is preferable to use the left side of the equation, i.e. ln  a  , since the right side ln a - ln b is vulner-
                                                                             b
able to the problem of subtractive cancellation, which can give an incorrect answer of 0 if a and b are nearly equal.

Combine  that  result  with  the  derivative  d   (ln  x) =  1                   for  x>0  to  get:

Logarithmic Differentiation

   For some functions it is easier to differentiate the natural logarithm of the function first and
then solve for the derivative of the original function. This technique is called logarithmic
differentiation, demonstrated in the following two examples.

Example 2.7

Find the derivative of y = xx.

Solution: For this example assume x > 0 (since x is both the base and the exponent). Note that you
cannot use the Power Rule for this function since the exponent x is a variable, not a fixed number.
Instead, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation y = xx and then take the derivative of
both sides and solve for y:

                                  ln y = ln xx = x · ln x

                             d (ln y) = d (x · ln x)
                             dx      dx

                                  y =  1 · ln x + x · 1
                                  y                          x

                                  y = y (ln x + 1) = xx (ln x + 1)

Find the derivative of y = (1+sin x)5 .
Solution: Use logarithmic differentiation by taking the natural logarithm of y and then use properties
of logarithms to simplify the differentiation before solving for y:

                 ln y = ln (1 + sin x)5 (2x + 1)7(3x3 - 7x + 6)4 = ln (2x + 1)7(3x3 - 7x + 6)4 - ln (1 + sin x)5

Radioactive Decay

   A classic example of the differential equation dt dy = k y is the case of exponential decay of a
radioactive substance, often referred to simply as radioactive decay. In this case the general

solution y = A ekt represents the amount of the substance at time t  0, and the decay constant
k is negative: dt dy < 0 since the substance is decaying (i.e. the amount of substance is decreasing)
while y > 0 , so dt dy = k y implies that k < 0.

   The constant A is the initial amount of the sub-                 y
stance, i.e. the amount at time t = 0: y(0) = A e0t =
A e0 = A. For this reason A is sometimes denoted               A0

by A0. The constant k turns out to be related                 1

to the half-life of the substance, defined as the             2 A0                 y = A0 ekt (k < 0)

time tH required for half the current amount of                    0                                                  t
                                                                            tH
substance to decay (see Figure 2.3.3).                      y(t) = A0 ekt
                                                            halved when       Figure 2.3.3
You might be tempted to think that the half-life            independent    is the current amount of the
                                                                           the time tH has passed, that
is not a constant, that it might change depending                          of the initial amount A0 and

on the amount of substance present. For exam-

ple, perhaps it would take longer for 100 g of the

substance to decay to 50 g than it would for 10 g

to decay to 5 g. However, this is not so. To see

why, pick any t  0 as the current time, so that

substance. By definition, that amount should be
                    1
is,  y(t +  tH)  =  2  y(t).  Then tH  does turn out to be

depends only on k, since

            y(t + tH) = 12 y(t)  A0 ek(t+tH) = 12 A0 ekt  A0ekt · ektH = 12A0ekt
                                        ektH = 12  ktH = ln 12 = - ln 2

and so:

                              tH = - ln 2 and k = - ln 2                          (2.6)
                                        k                   tH

Example 2.9

Suppose that 5 mg of a radioactive substance decays to 3 g in 6 hours. Find the half-life of the substance.
Solution: Consider A0 = 5 mg as the initial amount, so that y(t) = 5ekt is the amount at time t  0 hours.
Use the given information that y(6) = 3 mg to find k, the decay constant of the substance:

                                3 = y(6) = 5ek6  6k = ln 35  k = 16 ln 0.6
              The Exponential and Natural Logarithm Functions · Section 2.3 51

Then the half-life tH is:               ln 2        ln 2

                           tH = -       k     = -16 ln 0.6  = 8.14 hours

Note in the above example that the given time t = 6 was used for finding the constant k and
then the half-life tH. For the converse problem--given the half-life find the time required for a
certain amount to decay--you would do the opposite: use the given tH to find k and then solve
for the required time t from the equation y(t) = A0 ekt.

Example 2.10

Another example of the differential equation dt dy = k y is exponential growth of cell bacteria, in which
case k > 0 since the number of cells y(t) at time t is increasing.

Example 2.11

Another example is for the current I in a simple series electric                        R

                                                                                  I(t)              C
capacitor with capacitance C, a resistor with resistance R, and a
switch, as in Figure 2.3.4. If the capacitor is initially uncharged V             Figure 2.3.4
when the switch is open, and if the switch is closed at time t = 0,
then the current I(t) through the circuit at time t  0 satisfies (by
Kirchoff 's Second Law) the differential equation

                           RC dI + I = 0  dI = - I

so that I(t) = I0 e-t/RC where I0 is the initial current at t = 0. Ohm's Law says that V = I0R, so

                                                             I(t) = V e-t/RC
                                                                       R

is the current at time t  0, which decreases exponentially.

Example 2.12

In the previous examples the quantities that decayed or grew exponentially did so as functions of

time. There are other possible variables besides time, though. For example, the atmospheric pres-

sure p measured as a function of height h above the surface of the Earth satisfies--assuming constant

temperature--the differential equation

                                              dp = - w0 p
                                              dh    p0

where p0 is the pressure at height h = 0 (i.e. ground level) and w0 is the weight of a cubic foot of air at
pressure p0 (with air pressure measured in lbs per square foot and height measured in feet). Thus,

                                           p(h) = p0 e- p0 w0 h .

So the atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially as the height above the ground increases.

2.4 General Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

For a general exponential function y = ax, with a > 0, use logarithmic differentiation to find its
derivative:

                                        ln y = ln ax = x ln a

                                    d (ln y) = d (x ln a) = ln a
                                    dx                dx

                                        y =  ln a  y = y · ln a
                                        y

Thus, the derivative of y = ax is:

                                               d ax = (ln a) ax
                                               dx

In general, for an exponent of the form u = u(x):

                                        d au = (ln a) au · du
                                        dx                          dx

Example 2.13
Find the derivative of y = 2cos x.
Solution: This is the case where a = 2, so:

                              dy = (ln 2) 2cos x · d (cos x) = -(ln 2) (sin x) 2cos x
                              dx               dx

Note that any exponential function y = ax can be expressed in terms of the exponential

function ex. Since                      ax > 0  eln(ax) = ax ,

and since ln (ax) = x ln a, then:

                                                      ax = ex ln a

Computers and calculators often use the above formula to calculate ax.

The function y = ax has an inverse for any a > 0, except for a = 1 (in that case y = 1x = 1 is

just a constant function). To see this, notice that since ax > 0 for all x, and ln a < 0 for 0 < a < 1,

while  ln a > 0  for  a > 1,  then  dy  = (ln  a) ax  is  always  negative  if  0<a<1  and  always  positive  if
                                    dx
a > 1. Thus, y = ax is a strictly decreasing function if 0 < a < 1, and it is a strictly increasing

function if a > 1. The graphs in each case are shown in Figure 2.4.1.

Figure 2.4.1 y = ax

   Hence, for any a > 0 with a = 1 the function f (x) = ax is one-to-one, so it has an inverse
function, called the base a logarithm and denoted by f -1(x) = loga x. It is often spoken as "log
base a of x". The graphs for a < 1 and a > 1 are shown in Figure 2.4.2. Note that the natural
logarithm is just the base a logarithm in the special case with a = e, i.e. ln x = loge x. The base
a logarithm has properties similar to those of the natural logarithm (and the corresponding
properties of ax):

               loga (bc) = loga b + loga c      ab · ac = ab+c
               loga b = loga b - loga c
                                                    ab = ab-c
                       c                            ac
                 loga bc = c loga b               ab c = abc
                  loga 1 = 0
                                                    a0 = 1

Note that loga x can be put in terms of the natural logarithm, since
                             x = aloga x  ln x = ln aloga x = (loga x) · (ln a)

so dividing the last expression by ln a gives:
                                                        loga x = ln x ln a

The above formula is useful on calculators that do not have a loga x key or function. Taking
the derivative of both sides yields:

                                                    ddx loga x = 1 x ln a

In general, when taking the logarithm of a function u = u(x):
                                         ddx loga u = 1 u ln a · du dx = u u ln a

Example 2.14
Find the derivative of y = log2(cos 4x).
Solution: This is the case where a = 2, so:

                                     dy dx = 1 (cos 4x) (ln 2) · ddx (cos 4x) = - 4 sin 4x (ln 2) (cos 4x)

   The number a is the base of both the logarithm function loga x and the exponential function
ax. Base 2 and base 10 are the most commonly used bases other than base e. Base 10 is how
numbers are normally expressed, as combinations of powers of 10 (e.g. 2014 = 2·103 + 0·102 +
1 · 101 + 4 · 100). Base 2 is especially useful in computer science, since computers represent all
numbers in binary format, i.e. as a sequence of zeros and ones, indicating how many successive
powers of two to take and then sum up.8 For example, the number 6 is represented in binary
format as 110, since 1 · 22 + 1 · 21 + 0 · 20 = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6.

3.1 Tangent Lines

Everyone knows that the Earth is not flat, but locally, e.g. in your immediate vicinity, isn't
the Earth effectively flat? In other words, "flat" is a fairly good approximation of the Earth's
surface "near" you, and it simplifies matters enough for you to do some useful things.

   This idea of approximating curved shapes by straight shapes is a frequent theme in calculus.
Recall from Chapter 1 that by the Microstraightness Property a differentiable curve y = f (x)
actually is a straight line over an infinitesimal interval, having slope dx dy . The extension of that
line to all values of x is called the tangent line:

For a curve y = f (x) that is differentiable at x = a, the tangent line to the curve at the
point P = (a, f (a)) is the unique line through P with slope m = f (a). P is called the point
of tangency. The equation of the tangent line is thus given by:

    y - f (a) = f (a) · (x - a)                                                                 (3.1)

   Figure 3.1.1 on the right shows the tangent line to a        y
curve y = f (x) at a point P. If you were to look at the curve                   slope = f (a)
near P with a microscope, it would look almost identical
to its tangent line through P. Why is this line--of all pos-    tangent                         y = f (x)
sible lines through P--such a good approximation of the         line P
curve near P? It is because at the point P the tangent line
and the curve both have the same rate of change, namely,                                                   x
f (a). So the curve's values and the line's values change                  a
by roughly the same amount slightly away from P (where          Figure 3.1.1 Tangent line
the line and curve have the same value), making their
values nearly equal.

Example 3.1                                                                           y
Find the tangent line to the curve y = x2 at x = 1.                                                    y = x2
Solution: By formula (3.1), the equation of the tangent line is
                                                                                   1 (1,1) y = 2x - 1
                                y - f (a) = f (a) · (x - a)                        01 x
                                                                                 -1
with a = 1 and f (x) = x2. So f (a) = f (1) = 12 = 1. Both the curve                 Figure 3.1.2
y = x2 and the tangent line pass through the point (1, f (1)) = (1,1). The
derivative of f (x) = x2 is f (x) = 2x, so f (a) = f (1) = 2(1) = 2, which
is the slope of the tangent line at (1,1). Hence, the equation of the
tangent line is y - 1 = 2(x - 1), or (in slope-intercept form) y = 2x - 1.

The curve and tangent line are shown in Figure 3.1.2. Near the point
(1,1) the curve and tangent line are close together, but the separation
grows farther from that point, especially in the negative x direction.

   In trigonometry you probably learned about tangent lines to circles, where a
tangent line is defined as the unique line that touches the circle at only one point,
as in the figure on the right. In this case the tangent line is always on one side of
the circle, namely, the exterior of the circle; it does not cut through the interior of
the circle. In fact, that definition is a special case of the calculus definition. In general, though,
the tangent line to any other type of curve will not necessarily be on only one side of the curve,
as it was in Example 3.1.

Example 3.2                                                                                 y y = x3
                                                                                 y=0
Find the tangent line to the curve y = x3 at x = 0.
Solution: Use formula (3.1) with a = 0 and f (x) = x3. Then f (a) = f (0) =                   (0,0) x
03 = 0. The derivative of f (x) = x3 is f (x) = 3x2, so f (a) = f (0) = 3(0)2 =       Figure 3.1.3
0. Hence, the equation of the tangent line is y - 0 = 0(x - 0), which is
y = 0. In other words, the tangent line is the x-axis itself.                            y y = x y = sin x
                                                                                           (0,0) x
As shown in Figure 3.1.3, the tangent line cuts through the curve. In
general it is possible for a tangent line to intersect the curve at more           Figure 3.1.4
than one point, depending on the function.

Example 3.3

Find the tangent line to the curve y = sin x at x = 0.

Solution: Use formula (3.1) with a = 0 and f (x) = sin x. Then f (a) =
f (0) = sin 0 = 0. The derivative of f (x) = sin x is f (x) = cos x, so
f (a) = f (0) = cos 0 = 1. Hence, the equation of the tangent line is
y - 0 = 1(x - 0), which is y = x, as in Figure 3.1.4. Near x = 0, the
tangent line y = x is close to the line y = sin x, which was shown in
Section 1.3 (namely, sin dx = dx, so that sin x  x for x  1).
58 Chapter 3 · Topics in Differential Calculus                         §3.1

There are several important things to note about tangent lines:

· The slope of a curve's tangent line is the slope of the curve.
   Since the slope of a tangent line equals the derivative of the curve at the point of tangency,
   the slope of a curve at a particular point can be defined as the slope of its tangent line
   at that point. So curves can have varying slopes, depending on the point, unlike straight
   lines, which have a constant slope. An easy way to remember all this is to think "slope =
   derivative."

· The tangent line to a straight line is the straight line itself.
   This follows easily from the definition of a tangent line, but is also easy to see with the "slope
   = derivative" idea: a straight line's slope (i.e. derivative) never changes, so its tangent line--
   having the same slope--will be parallel and hence must coincide with the straight line (since
   they have the points of tangency in common). For example, the tangent line to the straight
   line y = -3x + 2 is y = -3x + 2 at every point on the straight line.

· The tangent line can be thought of as a limit of secant lines.
   A secant line to a curve is a line that passes through two points on the curve. Figure 3.1.5
   shows a secant line LPQ passing through the points P = (x0, f (x0)) and Q = (w, f (w)) on the
   curve y = f (x),

Figure 3.1.5  Secant line LPQ approaching the tangent line TP as Q  P

As the point Q moves along the curve toward P, the line LPQ approaches the tangent line
TP at the point P, provided the curve is smooth at P (i.e. f (x0) exists). This is because the
slope of LPQ is ( f (w) - f (x0))/(w - x0), and so

lim slope of LPQ = lim f (w) - f (x0) = f (x0) = slope of TP
QP                      wx0 w - x0

which means that as Q approaches P the "limit" of the secant line LPQ has the same slope
and goes through the same point P as the tangent line TP.

· Smooth curves have tangent lines, nonsmooth curves do not.
   For example, think of the absolute value function f (x) = |x|. Its graph has a sharp edge
   at the point (0, 0), making it nonsmooth there, as shown in Figure 3.1.6(a) below. There
   is no real way to define a tangent line at (0, 0), because as mentioned in Section 1.2, the
   derivative of f (x) does not exist at x = 0. The same holds true for curves with cusps, as in
   Figure 3.1.6(b).

   Figure 3.1.6 Nonsmooth curves: no tangent line at the nonsmooth points

Many lines go through the point of nonsmoothness, some of which are indicated by the
dashed lines in the above figures, but none of them can be the tangent line. Sharp edges
and cusps have to be "smoothed out" to have a tangent line.

   As a point moves along a smooth curve, the corresponding tangent lines to the curve make
varying angles with the positive x-axis--the angle is thus a function of x. Let  = (x) be the
smallest angle that the tangent line L to a curve y = f (x) makes with the positive x-axis, so
that -90 < (x) < 90 for all x (see Figure 3.1.7).

negative slope, 0 < (x) < 90 when L has positive slope, and (x) = 0                 rise
when L is horizontal (i.e. has zero slope). The slope of a line is usually (x)
defined as the rise divided by the run in a right triangle, as shown in the run

figure on the right. The figure shows as well that by definition of the tangent of an angle,

tan (x) also equals the rise (opposite) over run (adjacent). Thus, since the slope of L is f (x),

this means that tan (x) = f (x). In other words:

The tangent line to a curve y = f (x) makes an angle (x) with the positive x-axis, given by

3.2 Limits: Formal Definition

So far only the intuitive notion of a limit has been used, namely:

  A real number L is the limit of f (x) as x approaches a if the values of f (x) can be made
  arbitrarily close to L by picking values of x sufficiently close to a.

That notion can be put in terms of a formal definition as follows:

  Let L and a be real numbers. Then L is the limit of a function f (x) as x approaches a,
  written as

                                                       lim f (x) = L ,

                                                                         xa

  if for any given number  > 0, there exists a number  > 0, such that

                                     | f (x) - L| <  whenever 0 < |x - a| <  .

A visual way of thinking of this definition is shown in Figure 3.2.1 below:

                       y                        y = f (x)
                 L+
| f (x) - L| < 
                     L

                 L-

                          (                     )          x
                          a- a a+

                                                                   0 < |x - a| < 

                                                    Figure 3.2.1 lim f (x) = L

                                                                                                 xa

Figure 3.2.1 says that for any interval around L on the y-axis, you will be able to find at least
one small interval around x = a (but excluding a) on the x-axis that the function y = f (x) maps
completely inside that interval on the y-axis. Choosing smaller intervals around L on the
y-axis could force you to find smaller intervals around a on the x-axis.

   In Figure 3.2.1, f (x) is made arbitrarily close to L (within any distance  > 0) by picking x
sufficiently close to a (within some distance  > 0). Since 0 < |x - a| <  means that x = a itself
is excluded, the solid dot at (a, L) could even be a hollow dot. That is, f (a) does not have to
equal L, or even be defined; f (x) just needs to approach L as x approaches a. Thus-perhaps
counter-intuitively--the existence of the limit does not actually depend on what happens at
x = a itself.

Example 3.6
Show that lim x = a for any real number a.

                    xa

Solution: Though the limit is obvious, the following "epsilon-delta" proof shows how to use the formal
definition. The idea is to let  > 0 be given, then "work backward" from the inequality | f (x) - L| <  to
get an inequality of the form |x - a| < , where  > 0 usually depends on . In this case the limit is L = a
and the function is f (x) = x, so since

                                     | f (x) - a| <   |x - a| <  ,

then choosing  =  means that

                                    0 < |x - a| <   |x - a| <   | f (x) - a| <  ,

which by definition means that lim x = a.

                                                          xa

   Calculating limits in this way might seem silly since--as in Example 3.6--it requires extra
effort for a result that is obvious. The formal definition is used most often in proofs of general
results and theorems. For example, the rules for limits--listed in Section 1.2--can be proved
by using the formal definition.

Example 3.7

Suppose that lim f (x) and lim g(x) both exist. Show that
             xa  xa

                 lim ( f (x) + g(x)) = lim f (x) + lim g(x)
                 xa                 xa                         xa

Solution: Let lim f (x) = L1 and lim g(x) = L2. The goal is to show that lim ( f (x) + g(x)) = L1 + L2. So let
             xa      xa                                            xa
 > 0. Then /2 > 0, and so by definition there exist numbers 1 > 0 and 2 > 0 such that

                 0 < |x - a| < 1  | f (x) - L1 | < /2 , and
                 0 < |x - a| < 2  | g(x) - L2 | < /2 .

Now let  = min(1,2). Then  > 0 and

                 0 < |x - a| <   0 < |x - a| < 1 and 0 < |x - a| < 2
                                       | f (x) - L1 | < /2 and | g(x) - L2 | < /2

Since | A + B|  | A| + |B| for all real numbers A and B, then

| f (x) + g(x) - (L1 + L2)| = |( f (x) - L1) + (g(x) - L2)|  | f (x) - L1 | + | g(x) - L2 |

and thus

                 0 < |x - a| <   | f (x) + g(x) - (L1 + L2)| < /2 + /2 = 

which by definition means that lim ( f (x) + g(x)) = L1 + L2.

   The proofs of the other limit rules are similar.1 In general, using the formal definition will
not be necessary for evaluating limits of specific functions--in many cases a simple analysis of
the function is all that is needed, often from its graph.

Evaluate lim f (x) for the following function:                                                      y
                                                                                                                     y = f (x)
                 x1
                                                                                                  2
                           if x > 1
                        x  if x = 1                                                               1
             f (x) =  21   if x < 1                                                                 01 x
                                                                                                   Figure 3.2.2
Solution: From the graph of f (x) in Figure 3.2.2, it is clear that as x
approaches 1 from the right (i.e. for x > 1) f (x) approaches 1 along the
line y = x, whereas as x approaches 1 from the left (i.e. for x < 1) f (x)
approaches 1 along the horizontal line y = 1. Thus, lim f (x) = 1 .

                                                                                              x1

Note that the limit did not depend on the value of f (x) at x = 1.

   As Example 3.8 shows, what matters for a limit is what happens to the value of f (x) as x gets
near a, not at x = a itself. Figure 3.2.3(a) below shows how as x approaches a, f (x) approaches
a number different from f (a). Figure 3.2.3(b) shows that x = a does not even need to be in the
domain of f (x), i.e. f (a) does not have to be defined. So it will not always be the case that
lim f (x) = f (a).

   In Example 3.8 the direction in which x approached the number 1 did not affect the limit.
But what if f (x) had approached different values depending on how x approached 1? In that
case the limit would not exist. The following definitions and notation for one-sided limits
will make situations like that simpler to state.

 1For example, see Section 2.2 in PROTTER, M.H. AND C.B. MORREY, A First Course in Real Analysis, New York:
Springer-Verlag, 1977.

Call L the right limit of a function f (x) as x approaches a, written as
                                                    lim f (x) = L ,

                                                                    xa+

if f (x) approaches L as x approaches a for values of x larger than a.
Call L the left limit of a function f (x) as x approaches a, written as

                                                    lim f (x) = L ,

                                                                    xa-

if f (x) approaches L as x approaches a for values of x smaller than a.

The following statement follows immediately from the above definitions:

The limit of a function exists if and only if both its right limit and left limit exist and are

equal:

                      lim f (x) = L  lim f (x) = L = lim f (x)
                      xa                            xa-            xa+

Example 3.9

Evaluate lim f (x), lim f (x), and lim f (x) for the following function:             y
        x0-   x0+                    x0

                 f (x) =             x2   if x < 0                                2 y = f (x)
                                     2-x  if x  0

Solution: From the graph of f (x) in Figure 3.2.4, it is clear that as x          1

approaches 0 from the left (i.e. for x < 0) f (x) approaches 0 along the                           x
parabola y = x2, whereas as x approaches 0 from the right (i.e. for

x > 0) f (x) approaches 2 along the line y = 2 - x. Hence, lim f (x) = 0      -1 0      1
                                                         x0-
and lim f (x) = 2 . Thus, lim f (x) does not exist since the left and
x0+                   x0                                                             Figure 3.2.4

right limits do not agree at x = 0.

Example 3.10

Evaluate lim sin 1 .                                                            y
        x0+   x                                                               1 y = sin(1/x)

Solution: For x > 0 the function f (x) = sin (1/x) is defined, and its graph

is shown in Figure 3.2.5. As x approaches 0 from the right, sin (1/x) will    0                    x

be 1 for the numbers x = 2/, 2/5, 2/9, 2/13, ... (which approach 0),          -1

and sin (1/x) will be -1 for the numbers x = 2/3, 2/7, 2/11, 2/15, ...

(which also approach 0). So as x approaches 0 from the right, sin (1/x)              Figure 3.2.5
will oscillate between 1 and -1. Thus, lim sin 1 does not exist .

   So far only finite limits have been considered, that is, L = lim f (x) where L is a real (i.e.

                                                                                                                  xa

finite) number. Define an infinite limit, with L =  or -, as follows:

For a real number a, the limit of a function f (x) equals infinity as x approaches a, written
as

                                                    lim f (x) =  ,

                                                                     xa

if f (x) grows without bound as x approaches a, i.e. f (x) can be made larger than any
positive number by picking x sufficiently close to a:
For any given number M > 0, there exists a number  > 0, such that

                                    f (x) > M whenever 0 < |x - a| <  .

For a real number a, the limit of a function f (x) equals negative infinity as x approaches
a, written as

                                                   lim f (x) = - ,

                                                                   xa

if f (x) grows negatively without bound as x approaches a, i.e. f (x) can be made smaller
than any negative number by picking x sufficiently close to a:
For any given number M < 0, there exists a number  > 0, such that

                                    f (x) < M whenever 0 < |x - a| <  .

The above definitions can be modified accordingly for one-sided limits. If lim f (x) =  or

                                                                                                                                              xa

lim f (x) = -, then the line x = a is a vertical asymptote of f (x), and f (x) approaches the

xa

line x = a asymptotically. The formal definitions are rarely needed.

Example 3.11

Evaluate lim 1 .                                                                       y

Solution:  For  x=0  the  function  f (x) =  1  is  defined,  and  its  graph           0x
                                             x
is shown in Figure 3.2.6. As x approaches 0 from the right, 1/x

approaches , that is,                               lim 1 =  .
                                                    x0+ x

As x approaches 0 from the left, 1/x approaches -, that is,

                                                             lim 1 = - .               Figure 3.2.6

Since the right limit and the left limit are not equal, then lim 1 does not exist .

                                                                                 x0 x
Note that the y-axis (i.e. the line x = 0) is a vertical asymptote for f (x) = 1x .

Since the right limit and the left limit both equal , then lim 21 =  .
                                                                           x0 x
Note  that  the  y-axis  (i.e.  the  line     = 0)  is  a   vertical  asymptote  for      (x) =  1

   In the limit lim f (x) so far only real values of a have been considered. However, a could be

                          xa

either  or -:

  For a real number L, the limit of a function f (x) equals L as x approaches , written as
                                                       lim f (x) = L ,

                                                                        x

  if f (x) can be made arbitrarily close to L for x sufficiently large and positive:
  For any given number  > 0, there exists a number N > 0, such that

                                        | f (x) - L| <  whenever x > N .

For a real number L, the limit of a function f (x) equals L as x approaches -, written as

                                                    lim f (x) = L ,

                                                                   x-

if f (x) can be made arbitrarily close to L for x sufficiently small and negative:
For any given number  > 0, there exists a number N < 0, such that

                                      | f (x) - L| <  whenever x < N .

The above definitions can be modified accordingly for L replaced by either  or -.

One way to interpret the statement lim f (x) = L is: the long-term behavior of f (x) is to
                                                        x
approach a steady-state at L. If lim f (x) = L or lim f (x) = L, then the line y = L is a
                                              x                            x-
horizontal asymptote of f (x), and f (x) approaches the line y = L asymptotically. Again, for

most limits of specific functions, only the intuitive notions are needed.

Example 3.13

From Figures 3.2.6 and 3.2.7, it is clear that

                         lim 1 = 0 = lim 1 and lim 21 = 0 = lim 21
                         x x               x- x                       x x             x- x

Note  that  the  x-axis  (i.e.  the  line  y = 0)  is  a  horizontal  asymptote  for  f (x) =  1  and  f (x) =  1
                                                                                               x
                                                                                                                x2 .

Some limits are obvious, and you can use them to calculate other limits:

      lim xn =                  for any real n > 0                    lim xn =  for n = 2, 4, 6, 8, . . .
      x                  0      for any real n < 0        x-                          - for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, . . .

            lim ex =                    lim ex = 0                    lim e-x = 0               lim e-x = 

            x                           x-                            x                        x-

                                    lim ln x =                          lim ln x = -

                                    x                                   x0+

A related notion is that of Big O notation (that is the capital letter O, not a zero):

Say that

                                           f (x) = O(g(x)) as x  ,

spoken as " f is big O of g", if there exist positive numbers M and x0 such that

                                           | f (x)|  M | g(x)| for all x  x0.

For example, obviously 2x3 = O(x3), by picking M = 2, with x0 any positive number. In general,
f (x) = O(g(x)) means that f exhibits the same long-term behavior as g, up to a constant multi-
ple. You can think of g as the more basic "type" of function that describes f , as far as long-term
behavior.

Example 3.14
Show that 5x4 - 2 = O(x4).
Solution: First, recall from algebra that |a + b|  |a| + |b| for all real numbers a and b. Thus,

                                              5x4 - 2  5x4 + |-2| = 5 x4 + 2

for all x. So since x4 = x4  1 for all x  1, then

                   5x4 - 2  5 x4 + 2  5 x4 + 2 x4  5x4 - 2  7 x4 for all x  1,

which shows that 5x4 - 2 = O(x4), with M = 7 and x0 = 1.

Some limits need algebraic manipulation before they can be evaluated.

Example 3.15

Evaluate lim        x+1 - x .

                 x

Solution: Note that both x + 1 and x approach  as x goes to , resulting in a limit of the form
 - . This is an example of an indeterminate form, which can equal anything (as will be discussed
shortly); it does not have to equal 0 (i.e. the 's do not necessarily "cancel out"). The trick here is to use
the conjugate of x + 1 - x, so that

lim    x + 1 - x = lim              x + 1 - x · x + 1 + x = lim (x + 1) - x = lim                    1        =0
                                                       x + 1 + x x x + 1 + x x                   x+1 +     x
x                                x

since  the  numerator  is  1  and   both  terms  in  the  sum  in  the  denominator  approach    (i.e.  1  = 0).
                                                                                                        

   Some other indeterminate forms are /, 0/0 and ·0. How would you handle such limits?
One way is to use L'Hôpital's Rule2; a simplified form is stated below:

L'Hôpital's Rule: If f and g are differentiable functions and

                                          lim f (x) = ± or 0
                                          xa g(x) ± 0

then                                      lim f (x) = lim f (x) .
                                          xa g(x) xa g (x)

The number a can be real, , or -.

Example 3.16

Evaluate lim x 2x - 1 .
             x e

Solution: This limit is of the form /:

                                    lim x 2x - 1  
                                    x e              
                                                 = lim x2
                                                     x e           by L'Hôpital's Rule

                                                 =0

since the numerator is 2 and ex   as x  .
Note that one way of interpreting the limit being 0 is that ex grows much faster than 2x - 1. In fact,
using L'Hôpital's Rule it can be shown that ex grows much faster than any polynomial, i.e. exponential

growth outstrips polynomial growth.

Evaluate lim x .

             x ln x
Solution: This limit is of the form /:

                                           lim x  
                                           x ln x 

                                                         = lim 11

                                                                                x
                                                                                          x

                                        = lim x = 

                                            x

Note that one way of interpreting the limit being  is that x grows much faster than ln x. In fact,
using L'Hôpital's Rule it can be shown that any polynomial grows much faster than ln x, i.e. polynomial

growth outstrips logarithmic growth.

Example 3.18

Evaluate lim xe-2x .

                 x

Solution: This limit is of the form  · 0, which can be converted to /:

              lim xe-2x = lim 2x x  
              x  x e                    

                                        = lim 2x 1                                           by L'Hôpital's Rule
                                        x 2e

                                        =0

Note that the limit is another consequence of exponential growth outstripping polynomial growth.

Example 3.19

Evaluate lim 2 2x2 - 7x - 5 .
             x 3x + 2x - 1

Solution: This limit is of the form /:

              lim 2 2x  2 - 7x - 5                                                           by L'Hôpital's Rule
              x 3x + 2x - 1 

                                          = lim 4x - 7
                                             x 6x + 2

                                          , so use L'Hôpital's Rule again
                                            

                                           42
                                        =6=3

Note that the limit ended up being the ratio of the leading coefficients of the polynomials in the numer-
ator and denominator of the original limit. Note also that the lower-order terms (degree less than 2)
ended up not mattering. In general you can always discard the lower-order terms when taking the limit
of a ratio of polynomials (i.e. a rational function).

Example 3.20

Evaluate lim 1 - cos x .
    x0        x

Solution: This limit is of the form 0/0:

                          lim 1 - cos x  0
                          x0     x           0

                                             = lim sin x    by L'Hôpital's Rule
                                                x0 1

                                             = sin 0 1 = 0

                                                                                                                                                 f (x)

   There is an intuitive justification for L'Hôpital's Rule: since the limit limxa g(x) uses a ratio
to compare how f changes relative to g as x approaches a, then it is really the rates of change
of f and g--namely f  and g, respectively--that are being compared in that ratio, which is
what L'Hôpital's Rule says.

   The following result provides another way to calculate certain limits:

Squeeze Theorem: Suppose that for some functions f , g and h there is a number x0  0
such that

                                        g(x)  f (x)  h(x) for all x > x0

and that lim g(x) = lim h(x) = L. Then lim f (x) = L.
    x                     x                     x

Similarly, if g(x)  f (x)  h(x) for all x = a in some interval I containing a, and if

lim g(x) = lim h(x) = L, then lim f (x) = L.
xa            xa                 xa

   Intuitively, the Squeeze Theorem says that if one function is "squeezed" between two func-
tions approaching the same limit, then the function in the middle must also approach that
limit. The theorem also applies to one-sided limits (x  a+ or x  a-).

Example 3.21
Evaluate lim sin x .

             x x
Solution: Since -1  sin x  1 for all x, then dividing all parts of those inequalities by x > 0 yields

                          - 1  sin x  1 for all x > 0  lim sin x = 0
                          x   x           x                 x x

by the Squeeze Theorem, since lim -1 = 0 = lim 1 .

19. The famous "twin paradox," a result of Einstein's special theory of relativity, says that if one of a
    pair of twins leaves the earth in a rocket traveling at a high speed, then he will be younger than his
    twin upon returning to earth.3 This is due to the phenomenon of time dilation, which says that a
    clock moving with a speed v relative to a clock at rest in some inertial reference frame counts time
    slower relative to the clock at rest, by a factor of

                                                        = 1 ,

   called  the  Lorentz   factor,  where  =      v  is  the  fraction  of  the  speed  of  light  c  at  which  the  clock  is
                                                 c
   moving (c  2.998 × 108 m/sec). Notice that 0   < 1 (why?). For example, a clock moving at half

   the speed of light, so that  = 0.5, would have  = 1.1547, meaning that the clock runs about 15.47%

   slower than the clock on earth.

3.3 Continuity

Recall from the previous section that a limit limxa f (x) can exist without being equal to f (a),
or with f (a) not even being defined. Many functions encountered in applications, however, will
meet those conditions, and they have a special name:

A function f is continuous at x = a if

              lim f (x) = f (a) .                               (3.4)

              xa

A function is continuous on an interval I if it is continuous at every point in the interval.
For a closed interval I = [a, b], a function f is continuous on I if it is continuous on the
open interval (a, b) and if limxa+ f (x) = f (a) (i.e. f is right continuous at x = a) and
limxb- f (x) = f (b) (i.e. f is left continuous at x = b). A function is discontinuous at a
point if it is not continuous there. A continuous function is one that is continuous over its
entire domain.

Equation (3.4) in the above definition implies that f (a) is defined, i.e. x = a is in the domain of
f . Figure 3.3.1 below shows some examples of continuity and discontinuity:

y                                       y = f (x)

                                                   x

              x1 x2                     x3 x4

Figure 3.3.1  Continuous at x1, discontinuous at x2, x3 and x4

In the above figure, f is not continuous at x = x2 because limxx2 f (x) = f (x2); f is not contin-
uous at x = x3 because limxx3 f (x) does not exist (the right and left limits do not agree-- f is
said to have a jump discontinuity at x = x3); and f is not continuous at x = x4 because f (x4)
is not defined. However, f is continuous at x = x1.

   A function is continuous if its graph is one unbroken piece over its entire domain. Poly-
nomials, rational functions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic
functions are all continuous on their domains. For example, tan x is continuous over its do-
main, which is broken into disjoint intervals (-/2, /2), (/2, 3/2), (3/2, 5/2), and so forth;
the graph is unbroken on each of those intervals. However, tan x is not continuous over all of
R, since the function is not defined at all points in R.

   In the language of infinitesimals, a function f is continuous at x = a if f (a + dx) - f (a) is an
infinitesimal for any infinitesimal dx. This definition is rarely used.

   Physical examples of continuous functions are position, speed, velocity, acceleration, temper-
ature, and pressure. Some discontinuous functions do arise in applications.

                                     x = the largest integer less than or equal to x .

In other words, x rounds a non-integer down to the previous integer, and integers stay the same. For
example, 0.1 = 0, 0.9 = 0, 0 = 0, and -1.3 = -2. The graph of x is shown in Figure 3.3.2(a).

               Figure 3.3.2 Floor and ceiling functions

Similarly, the ceiling function x is defined as

            x = the smallest integer greater than or equal to x .

In other words, x rounds a non-integer up to the next integer, and integers stay the same. For example,
0.1 = 1, 0.9 = 1, 1 = 1, and -1.3 = -1. The graph of x is shown in Figure 3.3.2(b).

   Clearly both x and x have jump discontinuities at the integers, but both are continuous at all
non-integer values of x. Both functions are also examples of step functions, due to the staircase

appearance of their graphs. Step functions are useful in situations when you want to model a quantity
that takes only a discrete set of values. For example, in a car with a 4-gear transmission, f (x) could

be the gear the transmission has shifted to while the car travels at speed x. Up to a certain speed the

car remains in first gear ( f = 1) and then shifts to second gear ( f = 2) after attaining that speed, then
it remains in second gear until reaching another speed, upon which the car then shifts to third gear

( f = 3), and so on. In general, discrete changes in state are often modeled with step functions.

Example 3.23
For an extreme case of discontinuity, consider the function

                      f (x) =                    0 if x is rational
                                                 1 if x is irrational

This function is discontinuous at every value of x in R, since within any positive distance  of a real
number x--no matter how small  is--there will be an infinite number of both rational and irrational
                                                                            Continuity · Section 3.3 75

numbers. This is a property of R. So the value of f will keep jumping between 0 and 1 no matter how
close you get to x. In other words, for any number a in R, f (a) exists but it will never equal limxa f (x)
because that limit will not exist.

   By the various rules for limits, it is straightforward to show that sums, differences, con-
stant multiples, products and quotients of continuous functions are continuous. Likewise a
continuous function of a continuous function (i.e. a composition of continuous functions) is
also continuous. In addition, a continuous function of a finite limit of a function can be passed
inside the limit:

If f is a continuous function and lim g(x) exists and is finite, then:

                                                             xa

                            f lim g(x) = lim f (g(x))                   (3.5)
                            xa                 xa

The same relation holds for one-sided limits.

The above result is useful in evaluating the indeterminate forms 00, 0, and 1. The idea is
to take the natural logarithm of the limit by passing the continuous function ln x inside the
limit and evaluate the resulting limit.

Example 3.24

Evaluate lim xx .

                 x0+

Solution: This limit is of the form 00, so let y = lim xx and then take the natural logarithm of y:

                                                                                      x0+

ln y = ln lim xx

                   x0+

= lim ln xx (pass the natural logarithm function inside the limit)

    x0+

= lim x ln x  0 · (-)

    x0+

= lim ln x  -
x0+ 1/x                     

= lim 2 1/x                 by L'Hôpital's Rule
   x0+ -1/x

ln y = lim (-x) = 0

             x0+

Thus, lim xx = y = e0 = 1.

There is an important relationship between differentiability and continuity:

                                   Every differentiable function is continuous.

Proof: If a function f is differentiable at x = a then f (a) = lim x-a f (x)-f (a) exists, so

                                                                                                           xa

lim ( f (x) - f (a)) = lim ( f (x) - f (a)) · x - a = lim f (x) - f (a) · lim (x - a) = f (a) · 0 = 0
xa      xa                          x - a xa x - a  xa

which means that lim f (x) = f (a) , i.e. f is continuous at x = a .                                           y

                                  xa                                                                                     y = |x|
                                                                                                               0x
   Note that the converse is not true. For example, the absolute value
function f (x) = |x| is continuous everywhere--its graph is unbroken,
as shown in the picture on the right--but recall from Example 1.3 in
Section 1.2 that it is not differentiable at x = 0. Continuous curves
can have sharp edges and cusps, but differentiable curves cannot.

   Two other important theorems4 about continuous functions are:

Extreme Value Theorem: If f is a continuous function on a closed interval [a, b] then f
attains both a maximum value and a minimum value on that interval.

Intermediate Value Theorem: If f is a continuous function on a closed interval [a, b]
then f attains every value between f (a) and f (b).

                                                                                                               d
    ab             c  d

Figure 3.3.3 Extreme Value Theorem        Figure 3.3.4 Intermediate Value Theorem

Figure 3.3.3 shows why a closed interval is required for the Extreme Value Theorem, as f
attains neither a maximum nor minimum on the open interval (c, d). The Intermediate Value
Theorem says that continuous functions cannot "skip over" intermediate values between two
other function values. In Figure 3.3.4 the function f skips the value k between f (c) = 1 and
f (d) = 2 because f is not continuous over all of [c, d]. On [a, b] the value k is attained by f at
x = x0, i.e. f (x0) = k, since f is continuous on [a, b].

 4The full proofs require some advanced results. See pp.97-98 and p.558 in TAYLOR, A.E. AND W.R. MANN,
Advanced Calculus, 2nd ed., New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1972.

Example 3.25

Show that there is a solution to the equation cos x = x.

Solution: Let f (x) = cos x - x. Since f is continuous for all x, in particular it is continuous on [0,1]. So
since f (0) = 1 > 0 and f (1) = -0.459698 < 0, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem there is a number
c in the open interval (0,1) such that f (c) = 0, since 0 is between the values f (0) and f (1). Hence,
cos c - c = 0, which means that cos c = c. That is, x = c is a solution of cos x = x.

   Note in the above example that the Intermediate Value Theorem does not tell you how to
find the solution, just that the solution exists. To find the solution you can use the bisection
method: divide the interval [0, 1] in half and apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to each
half-interval to determine which one contains the solution; repeat this procedure on that half-
interval, resulting in a smaller interval containing the solution, then repeat the procedure over
and over, until you eventually obtain an interval so small that the midpoint of that interval
can be taken as the solution. Listing 3.1 below shows one way of implementing the bisection
method for Example 3.25 to find the root of f (x) = cos x - x, using the Python programming
language.

17  else:

18  print("Root = %.13f" % (midpt))

20 bisect(0, 1)

Line 8 sets the tolerance to 10-15: the program terminates upon reaching an interval whose
length is smaller than that. The output is shown below:

Root = 0.7390851332152

This is the number obtained by taking the cosine of a number (in radians) repeatedly.

3.4 Implicit Differentiation

A function y = f (x) is usually given by an explicit formula, such as y = x2. It is then straight-
forward to find dx dy using the differentiation rules you have learned so far. But suppose instead
that you were given merely an equation involving x and y, such as

                                         x3 y2 esin(xy) = x2 + x y + y3 .

The set of points (x, y) satisfying this equation describes some sort of curve in the x y-plane,

but it might not be possible to solve for y in terms of x--that is, there might not be an explicit

formula for y as a function of the variable x. So in this case does the derivative dx dy even have
any meaning, and if so then how would you find it?

   It turns out that dx dy does make sense in such a case, because an equation involving x and y
such as the one above implicitly defines y in terms of x in the following sense: as x varies so

does y. Hence it should be possible to find the rate of change of y with respect to the variable x

(i.e.  dx dy ).  To do so, take  d   of both sides of the equation, then assume that  y really is a function
                                 dx
of x so that you can use the Chain Rule to solve for dx dy . The example below illustrates this
procedure, called implicit differentiation.

Example 3.26

Find   dy  given  the  equation      x3 + 3x + 2 =  y2.                                          10
       dx

Solution: The above equation implicitly defines an elliptic curve, and its                       5

graph is shown on the right. This curve is not a function y = f (x), since it
violates the vertical line test, but y still varies with x. To find dy dx dy take dxd of 0 y
both sides of the equation then solve for dx :

                 d 3 d 2 -5
                     (x + 3x + 2) = (y )
                 dx                  dx                                                          -10

                           3x2 + 3 = 2y · dy by the Chain Rule, so             -4 -2 0 2 4 6
                                                dx                                            x

                                 dy 3x2 + 3
                                 dx = 2y

   At first this might seem unsatisfying--or confusing--since dx dy is given in terms of both x and y.
However, the derivative can still be evaluated at specific points (x, y) on the curve, i.e. any (x, y) satis-

fying the original equation. For example, it is easy to check that (x, y) = (1, 6) satisfies the equation
                                     3(1)2+3
3                2     dy                           6    dy
x + 3x + 2 = y , so dx (1, 6) =               = 2 . Note that dx is not defined when y = 0.
                                     26
   Notice that taking the square root of both sides of the original equation does not result in an explicit

formula for y, since y = ± x3 + 3x + 2 defines two functions, not just one. The beauty of implicit differen-

                                                     dy 3x2+3

tiation is that the derivative dx = 2y calculated above gives you a single expression for the derivative
of both those functions.

   An algebraic curve is defined as the set of all points (x, y) satisfying a polynomial equation
in the variables x and y, such as x2 - 3x y4 + 1 = x5 - y2. An elliptic curve is a special case of
an algebraic curve, where the polynomial has the specific form x3 + ax + b = y2, such as the
equation x3 + 3x + 2 = y2 from Example 3.26. Elliptic curves have certain properties that have

Solution: The above equation implicitly defines an algebraic curve and its  2

graph is shown on the right. To find dx dy take dxd of both sides of the equation 1
then solve for dx dy : 0 y

          d (x + y) = d (x3 + y3) -1
          dx              dx                                                -2

                 1 + dy = 3x2 + 3y2 · dy          by the Chain Rule, so                                      -3
                      dx            dx                                      -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3

                      dy 3x2 - 1                                                           x
                      dx = 1 - 3y2

   Notice that the curve consists of an oval shape (an ellipse, actually) with a line through it. In fact,
that line is y = -x, as can be verified by replacing each instance of y in the equation x + y = x3 + y3 by
-x (resulting in the equation 0 = 0). You might be wondering how dx dy is defined at the points where that
line intersects the ellipse: is it the slope of the line y = -x (i.e. -1), or is it the slope of the tangent line
to the ellipse at those points (which would not equal -1)? This is discussed in the exercises.

   The graph was created with the free open-source graphing program Gnuplot6 using the following

Example 3.28

Find the tangent line to the curve x2 + y2 = 1 at the point (4/5,3/5).                                                        y

Solution: This curve is the unit circle, shown in the picture on the right.                   x2 + y2 = 1
First use implicit differentiation to find dx dy :
                                                                                                                                     (4/5, 3/5)

   d (x2 + y2) = d (1)  2x + 2y · dy = 0 by the Chain Rule                                                                 0 1x

                             dx = - y

The  slope  m  of  the  tangent    line  to  the  curve      at   (4/5, 3/5)  is  then  m  =  dx dy (4/5, 3/5)  =     4/5  =  -4/3.  Thus,  the

equation  of  the  tangent  line   is        3  =-4      x- 4     .                                                - 3/5

3.5 Related Rates

If several quantities are related by an equation, then differentiating both sides of that equation
with respect to a variable (usually t, representing time) produces a relation between the rates
of change of those quantities. The known rates of change are then used in that relation to
determine an unknown related rate.

Example 3.29                                                                                                                 10
                                                                                                                   300
Suppose that water is being pumped into a rectangular pool at a
rate of 60,000 cubic feet per minute. If the pool is 300 ft long, 100
ft wide, and 10 ft deep, how fast is the height of the water inside
the pool changing?

Solution: Let V be the volume of the water in the pool. Since the
volume of a rectangular solid is the product of the length, width, h
and height of the solid, then

                       V = (300)(100)h = 30000h ft3 100

where h is the height of the water, as in the picture on the right. Both V and h are functions of time t
                                                 ft3/min
(measured   in  minutes),  and   dV    = 60000             was  given.   The   goal  is  to  find  dt dh .  Since
                                 dt

                                            dV = d (30000h) = 30000 dh

then                             dh          1 dV          1 · 60000 = 2 ft/min.

Example 3.30

Suppose that the angle of inclination from the top of a 100 ft pole to                                                         
the sun is decreasing at a rate of 0.05 radians per minute. How fast
is the length of the pole's shadow on the ground increasing when the                                                 
angle of inclination is /6 radians? You may assume that the pole is                                                100
perpendicular to the ground.

Solution: Let  be the angle of inclination and let x be the length of the

shadow, as in the picture on the right. Both  and x are functions of                               
                                                                                                       x
time  t  (measured  in  minutes),      and   d   = -0.05   rad/min   was  given      (the
                                             dt
derivative  is  negative  since    is  decreasing).  The   goal  is  to  find  dx  when
                                                                               dt

 = /6,   denoted  by  dx         (the vertical bar means "evaluated at" the value of the subscript to the right
                      dt
                          =/6
of the bar). Since

                x = 100 cot   dx = -100 csc2  · d = -100 csc2  · (-0.05) = 5 csc2 
                                         dt                     dt

then

Solution: Let r, h, and V be the radius, height, and volume, respectively, of the cylinder. Then V =  r2 h.

Since  dr  = -3  cm/min  and  dh  =2  cm/min,  then  by  the  Product  Rule:

dV = d ( r2 h) = 2 r · dr h +  r2 · dh  dV                         = 2 (8) (-3) (6) +  (82) (2) = -160 cm3

3.6 Differentials

An ideal gas satisfies the equation PV = RT, where R is a constant and P, V , and T are the
pressure, volume per mole, and temperature, respectively, of the gas. It will be proved that

                                                  dP + dV = dT .                                               (3.6)
                                                  P   V          T

Recall that dP, dV , and dT represent infinitesimal changes in the quantities P, V , and T,

respectively. Notice that none of the quotients in Equation (3.6) have an infinitesimal in the

denominator. For example, dP is divided not by dx or dt, as it would be in a derivative such

as  dP  or  dt dP .  Instead  it  is  divided by  P,  which  is  not  an  infinitesimal.  So  Equation  (3.6)  is  an
    dx
equation that relates infinitesimals themselves, i.e. infinitesimal changes, not infinitesimal

rates of change. This is, in fact, how many physical laws are stated, for reasons that will be

discussed shortly.
   Though infinitesimals have been used throughout this text, many calculus textbooks7 do

not even mention them, instead preferring to call them differentials.8 For compatibility, the

definition is given here:

For a differentiable function f (x), the differential of f (x) is                                       (3.7)
                                                     df = f (x) dx

where dx is an infinitesimal change in x.

Note that this is identical to Equation (1.9) in Section 1.3.

Example 3.32

Find the differential df of f (x) = x3.  df = f (x) dx = 3x2 dx
Solution: By definition,

Equivalently, this can be written as                  d(x3) = 3x2 dx ,

which is often the way it would appear in textbooks in the sciences.

   All the rules for derivatives (e.g. sum rule, product rule) apply to differentials, and can
be proved simply by multiplying the corresponding derivative rule by dx on both sides of the
equation:

 7More accurately, many current calculus textbooks never mention them. Calculus texts up through the 1930s or
so not only mentioned infinitesimals but used them extensively, even to the point of the texts themselves having
titles such as Introduction to Infinitesimal Calculus.
 8Though often in an unclear and sometimes confusing and misleading manner, as will be seen later in this section.
                                                   Differentials · Section 3.6 85

Let f and g be differentiable functions, and let c be a constant. Then:
(a) d(c) = 0

(b) d(c f ) = c df (Constant Multiple Rule)

(c) d( f + g) = df + dg (Sum Rule)

(d) d( f - g) = df - dg (Difference Rule)

(e) d( f g) = f dg + g df (Product Rule)

f                   g df - f dg   (Quotient Rule)
(f) d =
g                       g  2

(g) d( f n) = n f n-1 df (Power Rule)

(h) d( f (g)) = df dg         (Chain Rule)
                     dg

For example, to prove (e), multiply both sides of the usual Product Rule by dx so that

                        d( f g) = f dg + g df  d( f g) = dx f dg + g df
                        dx        dx     dx        dx dx

                                              d( f g) = f dg + g df

since the dx terms all cancel. The proofs of the other rules are similar.
   The differential version of the ideal gas law in Equation (3.6)

                                                      dP dV dT
                                                      P+V =T
can now be proved by taking the differential of both sides of the equation PV = RT:

                           d(PV ) = d(RT) = R · dT by the Constant Multiple Rule

             V dP + P dV = PV dT by the Product Rule and since R = PV
                                      T                                    T

             V dP + P dV = dT after dividing both sides by PV
             PV               PV  T

                        dP dV dT

Example 3.33

Suppose that M is the total mass of a rocket and its unburnt fuel at any time t (so M is a function of
t). Over an infinitesimal time dt a mass dm of fuel is burnt and the gas byproducts are expelled out the
rear of the rocket at a velocity vE relative to the rocket. Using the law of conservation of momentum
over the interval dt, show that

                                                             vE dm = M dv

where m and v are the mass of burnt fuel and the velocity of the rocket, respectively, at the beginning
of the time dt.

Solution: Momentum is defined as mass times velocity. The momentum of the rocket at the beginning
of the time dt is thus Mv. At the end of the time dt, the momentum of the rocket consists of two parts,
namely the momentum of the rocket and its remaining unburnt fuel, which is

((mass before dt) - (increase in burnt fuel)) × ((velocity before dt) + (increase in velocity))  (3.8)
                                                      (M - dm)(v + dv)                           (3.9)

and the momentum of the fuel that was burnt and expelled out the rear, which is

                                 (v - vE) dm .

So by conservation of momentum,

   Mv = (M - dm)(v + dv) + (v - vE) dm
   Mv = Mv - v dm + M dv - (dm)(dv) + v dm - vE dm, so
vE dm = M dv - (dm)(dv) = M dv

since (dm)(dv) = (m(t) dt)(v(t) dt) = m(t)v(t)(dt)2 = m(t)v(t) · 0 = 0.
Dividing both sides of vE dm = M dv by dt yields the equation

                                 M v = m vE

using the dot notation--mentioned in Section 1.3--for the derivative with respect to the time variable
t, which is still popular with physicists. Since v is just acceleration a, this formulation is the classic
equation for the acceleration of a rocket.9

   Letting f be the natural logarithm function and letting g = u in the differential version of
the Chain Rule yields the following useful result:

                                                        d(ln u) = du

This is often used in a differential version of the technique of logarithmic differentiation dis-
cussed in Section 2.3.

Example 3.35

The derivative of the area r2 of a circle of radius r, as a function of r, equals its circumference 2r. Use
the notion of a differential as an infinitesimal change to explain why this makes sense geometrically.

Solution: Let A = r2 be the area of a circle of varying radius r. Then A(r) = 2r, which is equivalent
to saying dA = 2r dr. To see why this makes sense geometrically, imagine increasing the radius by
dr, as in the picture below on the left. This increases the area A of the circle to A + dA, with dA the
infinitesimal area of the shaded ring in the picture.

                dr                      slice and                                            2r
                r                       roll flat
                                                                               dr      area = dA
                             dA
                                                                                       2(r + dr)

                                                                          dr           area = 0

                                                                    dr

Slice that ring along the dashed line then roll it flat, yielding a trapezoid with height dr, top length

2r (from the circumference of the inner circle of the ring), and bottom length 2(r + dr) (from the

circumference of the outer circle of the ring), as shown in the picture above on the right. The triangular

edges of the trapezoid contribute nothing to the area of the trapezoid, since (by the Microstraightness

Property) the hypotenuse of each is indeed a straight line, so each is a right triangle with height dr and
                                                  1 (dr)2
(by  symmetry)  base  dr,    thus   having  area            =  0.  Hence  the  entire  area  dA  of  the  trapezoid  comes
                                                  2
from the rectangular portion of height dr and base 2r, which means dA = 2r dr, as expected.

   The above example answers the question of whether it is a happy coincidence that the deriva-
tive of a circle's area turns out to be the circle's circumference--no, it is not! Some other such
cases (e.g. the derivative of a sphere's volume is its surface area) are left to the exercises. Note
that a similar "coincidence" does not occur for a square: if x is the length of each side then the
area is x2, but the derivative of x2 is 2x, which is not the perimeter of the square (i.e. 4x). Why
does this not follow the same pattern as the circle? Think about a key difference in the shape
of a square in comparison to a circle, keeping differentiability in mind.
88 Chapter 3 · Topics in Differential Calculus                                                        §3.6

   There are many benefits to using differentials--i.e. infinitesimals--in calculus.10 For exam-
ple, recall Example 3.31 in Section 3.5 on related rates, where the volume V of a right circular
cylinder with radius r and height h changes with time t as

        dV = 2 r · dr h +  r2 · dh .
        dt                                          dt               dt

The above equation forces you to consider only the derivative with respect to the time variable

t. What if you wanted to see the rates of change with respect to another variable, such as r,

h, or some other quantity? In that case using the differential version of the above equation,

namely      dV = 2 rh dr +  r2 dh

provides more flexibility--you are free to divide both sides by any differential, not just by dt.
Many related rates problems would likely benefit from this approach.

   Present-day calculus textbooks confuse the notion of a differential (infinitesimal) dx with
the idea of a small but real value x. The two are not the same. An infinitesimal is not a real
number and cannot be assigned a real value, no matter how small; x can be assigned real
values. Using dx and x interchangeably is a source of much confusion for students (likewise
for dy and y). This confusion rears its head in exercises involving the linear approximation
of a curve by its tangent line near a point x0, namely f (x)  f (x0) + f (x0)(x - x0) when x - x0
is "small" (e.g. 63  7.9375, by using f (x) = x, x = 63, x0 = 64, and x - xo = x = -1). Such
exercises have nothing to do with differentials, not to mention having dubious value nowadays.
They are remnants of a bygone era, before the advent of modern computing obviated the need
for such (generally) poor approximations.

            Applications of Derivatives

4.1 Optimization

Many physical problems involve optimization: finding either a maximum or minimum value of
some quantity. Optimization problems often have a constraint involving two variables which
allows you to rewrite the objective function--the function to optimize--as a function of a single
variable: use the constraint to solve for one variable in terms of another, then substitute that
expression into the objective function.

   First, the intuitive notions of maximum and minimum need clarifying.

  A function f has a global maximum at x = c if f (c)  f (x) for all x in the domain of f .
  Similarly, f has a global minimum at x = c if f (c)  f (x) for all x in the domain of f . Say
  that f has a local maximum at x = c if f (c)  f (x) for all x "near" c, i.e. for all x such that
  |x - c| <  for some number  > 0. Likewise, f has a local minimum at x = c if f (c)  f (x)
  for all x such that |x - c| <  for some number  > 0.

In other words, a global maximum is the largest value everywhere ("globally"), whereas a local
maximum is only the largest value "locally." Likewise for a global vs local minimum. The
picture below illustrates the differences.

                                 y
                                                                               y = f (x)

                  x

    a  c1  c2  b

In the picture, on the interval [a, b] the function f has a global minimum at x = a, a global
maximum at x = c1, a local minimum at x = c2, and a local maximum at x = b.

                                     Optimization · Section 4.1 91

   Every global maximum [minimum] is a local maximum [minimum], but not vice versa. In
physical applications global maxima or minima1 are the primary interest. The Extreme Value
Theorem in Section 3.3 guarantees the existence of at least one global maximum and at least
one global minimum for continuous functions defined on closed intervals (i.e. intervals of the
form [a, b]). All the functions under consideration here will be differentiable, and hence contin-
uous. So the only issues will be how to find the global maxima or minima, and how to handle
intervals that are not closed.

   Consider again the picture from the previous page, this time looking at how the derivative
f  changes over [a, b]. Intuitively it is obvious that near an internal maximum (i.e. in the
open interval (a, b)) such as at x = c1, the function should increase before that point and then
decrease after that point. That means that f (x) > 0 before x = c1 and f (x) < 0 after the
"turning point" x = c1, as shown below.

y                                     y = f (x)
                       f=0

f>0                         f<0
  a
                                 f=0  f>0

                                                 x

     c1                          c2   b

Assuming that f  is continuous (which will be the case for all the functions in this section),

then this means that f  = 0 at x = c1, that is, f (c1) = 0. Similarly, near the internal minimum
at x = c2, f (x) < 0 before x = c2 and f (x) > 0 after x = c2, so that f (c2) = 0. Points at which the
derivative is zero are called critical points (or stationary points) of the function. So x = c1
and x = c2 are critical points of f .

   Note in the picture that f  goes from positive to zero to negative around x = c1, so that f  is
decreasing around x = c1, i.e. f  = ( f ) < 0. Similarly, f  is increasing around x = c2, i.e. f  > 0.
This leads to the following test for local maxima and minima:2

Second Derivative Test: Let x = c be a critical point of f (i.e f (c) = 0). Then:
(a) If f (c) > 0 then f has a local minimum at x = c.

(b) If f (c) < 0 then f has a local maximum at x = c.

(c) If f (c) = 0 then the test fails.

To see why the test fails when f (c) = 0, consider f (x) = x3: f (0) = 0 and f (0) = 0, yet x = 0 is
neither a local minimum nor maximum in any open interval containing x = 0. Section 4.2 will
present an alternative for when the Second Derivative Test fails.

 1The words "maxima" and "minima" are the traditional plural forms of maximum and minimum, respectively.
 2A formal proof requires the Mean Value Theorem, which will be presented in Section 4.4.
92 Chapter 4 · Applications of Derivatives                                                         §4.1

   There is a simple visual mnemonic device for remembering the Second Derivative Test, due
to a generic minimum or maximum resembling a smile or frown, respectively:

++          --                                                             oo

   The "eyes" in the faces represent the sign of f  at a critical point, while the "mouths" indicate
the nature of that point (when f  = 0 nothing is known). The procedure for finding a global
maximum or minimum can now be stated:

How to find a global maximum or minimum
Suppose that f is defined on an interval I. There are two cases:
1. The interval I is closed: The global maximum of f will occur either at an interior

    local maximum or at one of the endpoints of I whichever of these points provides the
    largest value of f will be where the global maximum occurs.
    Similarly, the global minimum of f will occur either at an interior local minimum or at
    one of the endpoints of I; whichever of these points provides the smallest value of f will
    be where the global minimum occurs.

2. The interval I is not closed and has only one critical point: If the only critical
    point is a local maximum then it is a global maximum. If the only critical point is a local
    minimum then it is a global minimum.

In each case of the above procedure try to use the Second Derivative Test to verify that a critical
point is a local minimum or maximum, unless it is obvious from the nature of the problem that
there can be only a minimum or only a maximum.

Show that the rectangle with the largest area for a fixed perimeter is a

Solution: Let L be the perimeter of a rectangle with sides x and y. The           Figure 4.1.1
idea is that L is a fixed constant, but x and y can vary. Figure 4.1.1
shows that there are many possible shapes for the rectangle, but in all
cases L = 2x + 2y. Let A be the area of such a rectangle. Then A = x y,
which is a function of two variables. But

                                                L = 2x + 2y  y = L2 - x ,

is now a function of x alone, on the open interval (0, L/2) (since the length x is positive). Now find the
critical points of A:

                                     A(x) = 0  L2 - 2x = 0
                                                       x = L4 is the only critical point

This problem is thus the case of a function defined on an open interval having only one critical point.
Use the Second Derivative Test to verify that the sole critical point x = L/4 is a local maximum for A:

           A(x) = -2  A(L/4) = -2 < 0  A has a local maximum at x = L/4

Thus, A has a global maximum at x = L/4. Also, y = L/2 - x = L/2 - L/4 = L/4, which means that x = y,
i.e. the rectangle is a square.
Note: The constraint in this example was L = 2x + 2y and the objective function was A = x y.

Suppose a right circular cylindrical can with top and bottom lids will be assembled
to have a fixed volume. Find the radius and height of the can that minimizes the          Figure 4.1.2
total surface area of the can.

Solution: Let V be the fixed volume of the can with radius r and height h, as in
Figure 4.1.2. The volume V is a constant, with V = r2h. Let S be the total surface
area of the can, including the lids. Then

           S = 2r2 + 2rh

where the first term in the sum on the right side of the equation is the combined
area of the two circular lids and the second term is the lateral surface area of the
can. So S is a function of r and h, but h can be eliminated since

           V = r2h  h = r2 V

and so     S = 2r2 + 2r · r2 V = 2r2 + 2Vr

making S a function of r alone. Now find the critical points of S (i.e. solve S(r) = 0):

           S(r) = 0  4r - r2 2V = 0
                            r3 = V2

            r = 3 V2 is the only critical point

Since both r and h are lengths and have to be positive, then 0 < r < . So this is another case of a
function defined on an open interval having only one critical point. Use the Second Derivative Test to

verify that this critical point r =  3  V  is a local minimum for S:
                                        2

S(r) = 4 + r3 4V   S 3 V2 = 4 + V 4V = 12 > 0  S has a local minimum at r = 3 V2

                                                                2

Thus, S has a global minimum at r =        3  V , and

                                              2

                               r · r2 = r3 = V2  2r = r2 V = h .

Hence, r =  3  V  and h = 2 3  V     will minimize the total surface area, i.e.  the height should equal the
               2               2
diameter.

Note that this result can be applied to soda cans, where the volume is V = 12 fluid ounces  21.6 cubic
inches: both a diameter and height of about 3.8 inches will minimize the amount (and hence the cost)
of the aluminum used for the can. Yet soda cans are not that wide and short--they are usually thinner
and taller. So why is a non-optimal size used in practice? Other factors--e.g. packing requirements, the
need for small children to hold the can in one hand--might override the desire to minimize the cost of
the aluminum. The lesson is that an optimal solution for one factor (material cost) might not always be
truly optimal when all factors are considered; compromise is often necessary.

assuming the ground is flat and not sloped (i.e. horizontal)?                      L

ponents of the initial velocity are v0 cos  and v0 sin , respectively.    v0 cos 
Since distance is the product of velocity and time, then the horizon-

the initial velocity are (v0 cos )t and (v0 sin )t, respectively. Ignor-           Figure 4.1.3
ing wind and air resistance, the only other force on the projectile

will be the downward force g due to gravity, so that the equations of motion for the projectile are:

                                                       x = (v0 cos )t

The goal is to find  that maximizes the length L shown in Figure 4.1.3. First write y as a function of x:

           x = (v0 cos )t  t = x                  y = - 1 g x 2 + (v0 sin ) · x

Then L is the value of x > 0 that makes y = 0:

                           gL2                                       2v2    sin    cos       v2   sin  2

So L is now a function of , with 0 <  < /2 (why?). So if there is a single local maximum then it must
be the global maximum. Now get the critical points of L:

                     L() = 0  2v02 cos 2 = 0
                                                  g

                                    cos 2 = 0

                                             2 = 2   = 4 is the only critical point
Use the Second Derivative Test to verify that L has a local maximum at  = /4:

                         L() = - 4v02 sin 2  L(/4) = - 4v02 < 0
                                         g                                  g

                                                    L has a local maximum at  = 4

Thus,  L  has  a   global  maximum  at      =      i.e.  the projectile travels the farthest horizontally when

                                               4,               v2

launched at a 45 angle with the ground (with L 4 = g being the maximum horizontal distance).0

Note that once the formula for L as a function of  was found to be L = g v02 sin 2 , calculus was not actually

Example 4.4

Fermat's Principle states that light always travels along the path that takes the least amount of time.
So suppose that a ray of light is shone from a point A onto a flat horizontal reflective surface at an angle
1 with the surface and then reflects off the surface at an angle 2 to a point B. Show that Fermat's
Principle implies that 1 = 2.

Solution: Let L be the horizontal distance between A and B, let d1 be the distance the light travels
from A to the point of contact C with the surface a horizontal distance x from A, let d2 be the distance
from C to B, and let y1 and y2 be the vertical distances from A and B, respectively, to the surface, as in
the picture below.

   Since time is distance divided by speed, and since the speed of light is constant, then minimizing the

total time elapsed is equivalent to minimizing the total distance traveled, namely D = d1 +d2. The basic
idea here is that Fermat's Principle implies that for the light to go from A to B in the shortest time, the

unknown point C--and hence the unknown distance x--will have to be at a point that makes 1 = 2.
The distances L, y1 and y2 are constants, so the goal is to write the total distance D as a function of x,
find the x that minimizes D, then show that that value of x makes 1 = 2.

   First, note that C has to be between A and B as in the picture, otherwise the total distance D would

be larger than if C were directly below either A or B. This ensures that 1 and 2 are between 0 and
/2, and that 0  x  L.

   Next, by the Pythagorean Theorem and the above picture,

                                       d1 =         x2 + y2         and      d2 =        (L  -    x)2  +      y2

                                                              1                                                2

and so the total distance D = d1 + d2 traveled by the light is a function of x:

                                            D(x) =        x2 + y2 +               (L  -  x)2   +  y2

                                                                    1                              2

To find the critical points of D, solve the equation D(x) = 0:

D(x) =               x                 L-x          = 0  x = L - x  sin 1 = sin 2  1 = 2

                                    (L - x)2 + y22                       d1          d2
                   x2 + y2

                             1

since   the  sine  function  is  one-to-one  over    the         interval    [0,     ].
                                                                                  2
This seems to prove the result, except for one remaining issue to resolve: verifying that the minimum

for D really does occur at the x between 0 and L where D(x) = 0, not at the endpoints x = 0 or x = L

of the closed interval [0, L]. Note that using the Second Derivative Test in this case does not matter,

since you would have to check the value of D at the endpoints anyway and compare those values to the

values of D at the critical points. To find expressions for the critical points, note that

so that                                                                                                             x 10 - x
                                                                                                                         10
       T = timerow + timerun = distrow speedrow + distrun speedrun =   x + 2 + 16 10 - x ,
                                                                       4               5

where 0  x  10 is the distance along the coast where the boat lands. Then

       T(x) = x 4 x2 + 16 - 15 = 0  5x = 4 x2 + 16  25x2 = 16 (x2 + 16)  x = 163 ,

so  x  =  16  is  the  only  critical   point.  Thus,  the   (global)  minimum  of  T  will  occur  at  x  =  16    x  = 0,  or  x  = 10.
          3
Since                                                                                                         3,

                           T(0) = 3 , T(10) = 29 2  2.693 , T 163 = 135 = 2.6

then   T(  16     <  T (10)  <  T (0).  Hence,  the  global  minimum   occurs  when    landing  the  boat     x  =  16    5.33   miles
                                                                                                                    3
           3)
down the coast.

Note that this example shows the importance of checking the endpoints. It was quite close between
landing about 5.33 miles down the coast (2.6 hours) or simply rowing all the way to the destination
(about 2.693 hours)--the difference is only about 5.6 minutes. With just a slight change in a few of the
numbers, the minimum could have occurred at an endpoint. Moral: always check the endpoints!3

Example 4.6

Find the point (x, y) on the graph of the curve y = x that is closest to the point (1,0).

Solution: Let (x, y) be a point on the curve y = x. Then (x, y) = (x, x ),                      y                   y= x
so by the distance formula the distance D between (x, y) and (1,0) is                               (x, y)
given by

        D2 = (x - 1)2 + (y - 0)2 = (x - 1)2 + ( x )2 = (x - 1)2 + x ,

which is a function of x  0 alone. Note that minimizing D is equivalent                                       D

to minimizing D2. Since                                                                      0 (1,0) x

                     d(D2)      = 2 (x - 1) + 1 = 2x - 1 = 0  x = 2 is the only critical point,1

                       dx

                  d2(D2)

and since dx2 = 2 > 0 for all x, then by the Second Derivative Test x = 1/2 is a local minimum. Hence,
the global minimum for D2 must occur at the endpoint x = 0 or at x = 1/2. But D2(0) = 1 > D2(1/2) = 3/4,
so the global minimum occurs at x = 1/2. Hence, the closest point is (x, y) = (1/2, 1/2).

 3Another possible lesson is that optimal in the mathematical sense might, again, not mean optimal in a practical
sense. After all, presumably after the man is finished with whatever he had to do at the destination 10 miles down
the coast, he then has the inconvenience of going back about 4.67 miles to retrieve his boat. At his running speed
of 10 mph this would take 28 minutes, wiping out the 5.6 minutes he gained with his "optimal" landing spot!

Example 4.7

Find the width and height of the rectangle with the largest possible perimeter inscribed in a semicircle
of radius r.

Solution: Let w be the width of the rectangle and let h be the height, as                  r           h
in the picture. Then the perimeter is P = 2w + 2h. By symmetry and the
Pythagorean Theorem,                                                                               w
                                                                                                    2
                      h2 = r2 - w 2 2  h = 12 4r2 - w2
                                                                                           w
and so P = 2w + 4r2 - w2 for 0 < w < 2r. Find the critical points of P:

                 P(w) = 2 -                 w         = 0  w = 2 4r2 - w2

                                    4r2 - w2

                                                       w2 = 16r2 - 4w2

                                                       w = 4r is the only critical point,
                                                                      5

and since                       P(w) = - 4r2                    P 4r = - 53/2 < 0

                                                (4r2 - w2)3/2  5           2r

then P has a local maximum at w = 4r5 , by the Second Derivative Test. Since P(w) is defined for w in
the open interval (0,2r), the local maximum is a global maximum. For the width w = 4r5 the height is
h = r5 , which gives the dimensions for the maximum perimeter.

Note: If w were extended to include the cases of "degenerate" rectangles of zero width or height, i.e.
w = 0 or w = 2r, then the maximum perimeter would still occur at w = 4r5 , since P 4r5 = 10r5  4.472r is
larger than P(0) = 2r and P(2r) = 4r.

4.2 Curve Sketching

A function can increase between two points in different ways, as shown in Figure 4.2.1.

y                              y                                y

                            x                                x                                  x
(a) f  = 0: straight           (b) f  > 0: concave up           (c) f  < 0: concave down

               Figure 4.2.1 Increasing function f : f  > 0, different signs for f 

   In each case in the above figure the function is increasing, so that f (x) > 0, but the manner in
which the function increases is determined by its concavity, that is, by the sign of the second

derivative f (x). The function in the graph on the far left is linear, i.e. of the form f (x) = ax + b
for some constants a and b, so that f (x) = 0 for all x. But the functions in the other two graphs
are nonlinear. In the middle graph the derivative f  is increasing, so that f  > 0; in this case
the function is called concave up. In the graph on the far right the derivative f  is decreasing,
so that f  < 0; in this case the function is called concave down. The same definitions would
hold if the function were decreasing, as shown in Figure 4.2.2 below:

Concavity Theorem: Suppose that f is a twice-differentiable function on [a, b]. Then:
(a) If f (x) > 0 on (a, b) then f (x) is below the line l(x) joining the points (a, f (a)) and

     (b, f (b)) for all x in (a, b).

(b) If f (x) < 0 on (a, b) then f (x) is above the line l(x) joining the points (a, f (a)) and
     (b, f (b)) for all x in (a, b).

Proof: Only part (a) will be proved; the proof of part (b) is                 y

similar and left as an exercise. So assume that f (x) > 0 on f (b)
(a, b), and l(x) be the line joining (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)), as in            l(x)

the drawing on the right. The drawing suggests that f (x) <            f (a)

l(x) over (a, b), but this is what must be proved.

   The goal is to show that g(x) = f (x) - l(x) < 0 on (a, b),                         y = f (x)
since this will show that f (x) < l(x) on (a, b). Since f and

l are both continuous on [a, b] then so is g. Hence g has a a                                x
global maximum somewhere in [a, b], by the Extreme Value                               b

Theorem. Suppose the global maximum occurs at an interior point x = c, i.e. for some c in the

open interval (a, b). Then g(c) = 0 and g(c) = f (c) - l(c) = f (c) > 0, since l(x) is a line and

hence has a second derivative of 0 for all x. Then by the Second Derivative Test g has a local

minimum at x = c, which contradicts g having a global maximum at x = c. Thus, the global

maximum of g cannot occur at an interior point, so it must occur at one of the end points x = a

or x = b. In other words, either g(x) < g(a) or g(x) < g(b) for all x in (a, b). But f (a) = l(a)

and f (b) = l(b), so g(a) = 0 = g(b). Hence, g(x) < 0 for all x in (a, b), i.e. f (x) < l(x) for all x in

(a, b).

   Points where the concavity of a function changes have a special name:

  A function f has an inflection point at x = c if the concavity of f changes around x = c.
  That is, the function goes from concave up to concave down, or vice versa.

   Note that to be an inflection point it does not suffice for the second derivative to be 0 at
that point; the second derivative must change sign around that point, either from positive to
negative or from negative to positive. For example, f (x) = x3 has an inflection point at x = 0,
since f (x) = 6x < 0 for x < 0 and f (x) = 6x > 0 for x > 0, i.e. f (x) changes sign around x = 0
(and of course f (0) = 0). But for f (x) = x4, x = 0 is not an inflection point even though f (0) = 0,
since f (x) = 12x2  0 is always nonnegative. That is, f (x) = x4 is always concave up. Figure
4.2.3 below shows the difference:

Figure 4.2.3 Inflection vs non-inflection point at x = 0 with f (0) = 0

Figure 4.2.3(b) shows that a point where the second derivative is 0 is a possible inflection point,
but you still must check that the second derivative changes sign around that point. Using
local minima and maxima, concavity and inflection points, and where a function increases or
decreases, you can sketch the graph of a function.

Example 4.8

Sketch the graph of f (x) = x3 - 6x2 + 9x + 1. Find all local maxima and minima, inflection points,
where the function is increasing or decreasing, and where the function is concave up or concave down.

Solution: Since f (x) = 3x2 - 12x + 9 = 3 (x - 1) (x - 3) then x = 1 and x = 3 are the only critical points.
And since f (x) = 6x - 12 then f (1) = -6 < 0 and f (3) = 6 > 0. So by the Second Derivative Test, f
has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = 3. Since f (x) = 6x - 12 < 0 for x < 2 and
f (x) = 6x-12 > 0 for x > 2, then x = 2 is an inflection point, and f is concave down for x < 2 and concave
up for x > 2. The table below shows where f is increasing and decreasing, based on the sign of f :

tion is increasing or decreasing, and where the function is concave up or concave down. Also indicate

any asymptotes.

Solution: Since f (x) = (1+x2)2 then x = 1 and x = -1 are the only critical points. And since f (x) = (1+x2)3

then  f (1) =  1  > 0 and  f (-1) = - 1          < 0.  So by the Second Derivative   Test,  f  has a local minimum at
               2

x = 1 and a local maximum at x = -1. Since f (x) > 0 for x < - 3, f (x) < 0 for - 3 < x < 0, f (x) > 0 for

0 < x < 3, and f (x) < 0 for x > 3, then x = 0,± 3 are inflection points, f is concave up for x < - 3

and for 0 < x < 3, and f is concave down for - 3 < x < 0 and for x > 3. Since f (x) > 0 for x < -1

and x > 1 then f is increasing for |x| > 1. And f (x) < 0 for -1 < x < 1 means f is decreasing for |x| < 1.

Finally, since lim f (x) = 0 and lim f (x) = 0 then the x-axis (y = 0) is a horizontal asymptote. There are
               x                    x-
no vertical asymptotes (why?).

   If the Second Derivative Test fails then one alternative is the following test:

  First Derivative Test: For a continuous function f on an interval I, let x = c be a number
  in I such that f (c) is defined, and either f (c) = 0 or f (c) does not exist. Then:
  (a) If f (x) changes from negative to positive around x = c then f has a local minimum at

        x = c.

  (b) If f (x) changes from positive to negative around x = c then f has a local maximum at
        x = c.

This test merely states the obvious: a function decreases then increases around a minimum,
and it increases then decreases around a maximum.

Note that the Second Derivative Test could not be used for this function, since f (x) = 0 for all x (notice
also that f (x) is not defined at x = 0).

A more complete alternative to the Second Derivative Test is the following:4

Nth Derivative Test: A non-constant function f with continuous derivatives of all orders
up to and including n > 1 at x = c has either a local minimum, local maximum or inflection
point at x = c if and only if

                           f (k)(c) = 0 for k = 1, 2, . . ., n - 1 and f (n)(c) = 0

(i.e. the nth derivative is the first nonzero derivative at x = c). If so, then:
(a) If n > 1 is even and f (n)(c) > 0 then f has a local minimum at x = c.
(b) If n > 1 is even and f (n)(c) < 0 then f has a local maximum at x = c.

(c) If n > 1 is odd then f has an inflection point at x = c.

Note that the Second Derivative Test is the special case where n = 2 in the Nth Derivative
Test. Though this test gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a local maximum, local
minimum, and inflection point, calculating the first n derivatives can be complicated if n is
large and the given function is not simple.

Example 4.11

The Second Derivative Test fails for f (x) = x4 at the critical point x = 0, since f (0) = 0. But the first
4 derivatives of f (x) = x4 are f (x) = 4x3, f (x) = 12x2, f (3)(x) = 24x, and f (4)(x) = 24, which are all

continuous and  f (k)(0) = 0 for k = 1, 2, 3 and f (4)(0) = 24 = 0 .

So by the Nth Derivative Test, since n = 4 is even and f (4)(0) = 24 > 0 then f (x) = x4 has a local minimum
at x = 0. Note that f (x)  0 = f (0) for all x, so x = 0 is actually a global minimum for f .

   A common practice in many fields of science and engineering is to combine multiple named
constants (e.g. ) or variables in a function into one variable and then sketch a graph of that
function. The example below illustrates the technique.

Example 4.12

A hydrogen atom has one electron, and the probability of finding the electron in the ground state of the

hydrogen atom between radii r and r + dr is D(r) dr, where dr is an infinitesimal change in the radius
r (the distance from the electron to the nucleus), D(r) is the radial probability density function

                                                       D(r) = 4a3 r2 e-2r/a0

                                                                        0

and a0  5.291772 × 10-11 m is the Bohr radius. It is useful to analyze this function in terms of r  0 in

relation  to  the  Bohr  radius    a0  (e.g.  r  =  0.5a0 ,  a0,  2a0,  3a0).  To  do  this,  let  x  =  a0  ,  so  that

                                   D(r) = 4         r 2 -2 r             a0 D(x) = 4x2 e-2x

                                                    a0

and then sketch the graph of a0 D(x), which is shown below:

                                   0.6

                                   0.5

From the graph it looks like x = 1 (i.e. r = a0) is a local (and global) maximum, so that the electron is
most likely to be found near r = a0, and the probability drops off dramatically past a distance r = 3a0.
In the exercises you will be asked to show that r = a0 is indeed a local maximum and that the inflection
points are r = 1 ± 12 a0.

Note that the right side of the formula a0 D(x) = 4x2 e-2x does not involve a0, which was multiplied
over to the left side. In general that is the strategy when dealing with these sorts of functions where
variables and constants are combined. In this case the stray constant a0 can be multiplied with D since
that will not affect the location of critical and inflection points, nor fundamentally alter the general
shape of the graph.

4.3 Numerical Approximation of Roots of Functions

When finding critical points of a function f , you encounter the problem of solving the equation

f (x) = 0. The examples and exercises so far were set up carefully so that solutions to that

equation could be found in a simple closed form. But in practice this will not always be the

case--in fact it is almost never the case. For example, finding the critical points of the function
x2
f (x) = sin x - 2 entails solving the equation f (x) = cos x - x = 0, for which there is no solution

in a closed-form expression.
What should you do in such a situation?5 One possibility is to use the bisection method

mentioned in Section 3.3. In fact, in Example 3.25 the solution to the equation cos x = x (i.e.

cos x - x = 0) was shown to exist in the interval [0, 1], and then a demonstration of the

bisection method was given to find that solution.

The bisection method is one of many numerical methods for finding roots of a function (i.e.

where the function is zero). Finding the critical points of a function means finding the roots

of its derivative. Though the bisection method could be used for that purpose, convergence to
each root is usually slow. A far more efficient method is Newton's method6, whose geometric

interpretation is shown in Figure 4.3.1 below.

                              Figure 4.3.1 Newton's method for finding a root x¯ of f (x)

The idea behind Newton's method is simple: to find a root x¯ of a function f , choose an initial
guess x0 and then go up--or down--to the curve y = f (x) and draw the tangent line to the curve
at the point (x0, f (x0)). Let x1 be where that tangent line intersects the x-axis, as shown above;
repeat this procedure on x1 to get the next number x2, repeat on x2 to get x3, and so on. The
resulting sequence of numbers x0, x1, x2, x3, . . ., will approach the root x¯. Convergence under
certain conditions can be proved.7

 5Note: To "just give up"--as suggested semi-seriously by some students I have had--is not an option.

   The general formula for the number xn obtained after n  1 iterations in Newton's method
can be determined by considering the formula for x1. First, the tangent line to y = f (x) at the
point (x0, f (x0)) has slope f (x0), so the equation of the line is

                               y - f (x0) = f (x0) (x - x0) .                              (4.1)

The point (x1, 0) is (by design) also on that line, so that
                            0 - f (x0) = f (x0) (x1 - x0)  x1 = x0 - f f (x0) (x0)

provided that f (x0) = 0. The general formula for xn is given by the following algorithm:

Newton's method: For an initial guess x0, the numbers xn for n  1 are computed itera-

tively as:            xn = xn-1 - f f (xn-1) (xn-1) for n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

That is, each "next" number xn depends on the previous number xn-1. The algorithm
terminates whenever f (xn) = 0, or when the desired accuracy is reached. If f (xn) = 0 for

some n  0, then you could start over with a different initial guess x0.

   To implement this algorithm in a programming language (for which Newton's method is
well-suited), the following language-independent pseudocode can be used as a guide:

Example 4.14

Use Newton's method to find the root of f (x) = cos x - x.

Solution: Since the root is already known to be in the interval [0,1], choose x0 = 1 as the initial guess.
The numbers xn for n  1 can be computed with a hand-held scientific calculator, but the process is
tedious and error-prone. Using a computer is far more efficient and allows more flexibility.

   For example, the algorithm is easily implemented in the Java programming language. Save this code
in a plain text file as newton.java:

                   Listing 4.1 Newton's method in Java (newton.java)

1 public class newton {

2     public static void main(String[] args) {

3        int N = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); //Number of iterations

4        double x = 1.0; //initial guess

5        System.out.println("n=0: " + x);

6        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {

7           x = x - f(x)/derivf(x);

8           System.out.println("n=" + i + ": " + x);

9        }

10    }

11

12    //Define the function f(x)

13    public static double f(double x) {

14       return Math.cos(x) - x;

15    }

16

17    //Define the derivative f'(x)

18    public static double derivf(double x) {

19       return -Math.sin(x) - 1.0;

20    }

21 }

Though knowledge of Java would help, it should not be that difficult to figure out what the above code
is doing. The number of iterations N is passed as a command-line parameter to the program, and xn
is computed and printed for n = 0, 1, 2, ... , N. Note that the derivative of f (x) is "hard-coded" into the
program.8 There is also no error checking for the derivative being zero at any xn. The program would
simply halt on a division by zero error.

   Compile the code, then run the program with 10 iterations:

javac newton.java
java newton 10

The output is shown below:

 8There are some programming language libraries for calculating derivatives of functions "on the fly," i.e. dynami-
cally. For example, the GNU libmatheval C/Fortran library can perform such symbolic operations. It is available

Note that the solution x¯ = 0.7390851332151607 was found after only 4 iterations; the numbers xn repeat
for n  5. This is much faster than the bisection method.

   Another root-finding numerical method similar to Newton's method is the secant method,
whose geometric interpretation is shown in Figure 4.3.2 below:

                                y

                                                        (x0, f (x0))

                                                                (x1, f (x1))

                                Figure 4.3.2 Secant method for finding a root x¯ of f (x)

The idea behind the secant method is simple: to find a root x¯ of a function f , choose two initial
guesses x0 and x1, then go up--or down--to the curve y = f (x) and draw the secant line through
the points (x0, f (x0)) and (x1, f (x1)) on the curve. Let x2 be where that secant line intersects
the x-axis, as shown above; repeat this procedure on x1 and x2 to get the next number x3, and
keep repeating in this way. The resulting sequence of numbers x0, x1, x2, x3, . . ., will approach
the root x¯, under the right conditions.9

   Since the secant line through (x0, f (x0))          and (x1, f (x1)) has slope  f (x1)- f (x0) x1-x0 ,  the equation of
that secant line is:                                   f (x1) - f (x0) (x - x1)

                                         y - f (x1) =      x1 - x0

The point (x2, 0) is on that line, so that

    0 - f (x1) = f (x1) - f (x0) x1 - x0 (x2 - x1)  x2 = x1 - (x1 - x0) · f (x1) f (x1) - f (x0)

provided that x1 = x0. The general formula for xn is given by the following algorithm:

Secant method: For two initial guesses x0 and x1, the numbers xn for n  2 are computed
iteratively as:

              xn = xn-1 - (xn-1 - xn-2) · f (xn-1) f (xn-1) - f (xn-2) for n = 2, 3, 4, . . .              (4.2)

That is, each "next" number xn depends on the previous two numbers xn-1 and xn-2. The
algorithm terminates whenever xn = xn-1 (i.e. the numbers start repeating) or when the
desired accuracy is reached.

   One difference you might have noticed between the secant method and Newton's method is
that the secant method does not use derivatives. The secant method replaces the derivative
in Newton's method with the slope of a secant line which approximates the derivative (recall
how the tangent line is the limit of slopes of secant lines). This might seem like a drawback,
perhaps giving a "less accurate" slope than the tangent line, but in practice it is not really a
problem. In fact, in many cases the secant method is preferable, since computing derivatives
can often be quite complicated.

Example 4.15

Use the secant method to find the root of f (x) = cos x - x.
Solution: Since the root is already known to be in the interval [0,1], choose x0 = 0 and x1 = 1 as the
two initial guesses. The algorithm is easily implemented in the Java programming language. Save this

10       for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {

11          f1 = f(x1);

12          x = x1 - (x1 - x0)*f1/(f1 - f0);

13          x0 = x1;

14          f0 = f1; //Re-use f1 as f0 in the next iteration

Notice that the root was found after 6 iterations (n = 7). The undefined number NaN (which stands

Newton's method found the root after 4 iterations, while the secant method needed 6 iterations.
After 10 iterations the bisection method had yet to find the root to the same level of precision
as the other methods--it would take 52 iterations (that is, x52) to achieve similar accuracy to
16 decimal places.

   In general Newton's method requires fewer iterations to find a root than the secant method
does, but this does not necessarily mean that it will always be faster. Depending on the com-
plexity of the function and its derivative, Newton's method could involve more "expensive"
operations (i.e. computing values, as opposed to assigning values) than the secant method, so
that the few more iterations possibly required by the secant method are made up for by fewer
total computations.
116 Chapter 4 · Applications of Derivatives                                                §4.3

   To see this, notice that Newton's method always requires that both f (xn-1) and f (xn-1) be
computed for the nth term xn in the sequence. The secant method needs f (xn-1) and f (xn-2)
for the nth term, but a good programmer would save the value of f (xn-1) so that it could be
re-used (and hence not re-computed) as f (xn-2) in the next iteration, resulting in potentially
fewer total computations for the secant method.

   There are occasional pitfalls in using Newton's method. For example, if f (xn) = 0 for some
n  1 then Newton's method fails, due to division by 0 in the algorithm. The geometric reason

is clear: the tangent line to the curve at that point would be parallel to the x-axis and hence

would not intersect it (assuming f (xn) = 0). There would be no "next number" xn+1 in the
iteration! See Figure 4.3.3(a) below.

   Another possible problem is that Newton's method might move you away from the root, i.e.

not get closer, typically by a poor choice of x0. See Figure 4.3.3(b) above. In some extreme
cases, it is possible that Newton's method simply loops back and forth endlessly between the

same two numbers, as in Figure 4.3.4:

   In most cases a different choice for the initial guess x0 will fix such problems. Most textbooks
on the subject of numerical analysis discuss these issues.10

   There are conditions under which Newton's method is guaranteed to work, and convergence
is fast. Newton's method has a quadratic rate of convergence, meaning roughly that the error
terms--the differences between approximate roots and the actual root--are being squared in
the long term. More precisely, if the numbers xn for n  0 converge to a root x¯, then the error

The speed of modern computers makes the difference in algorithmic efficiency negligible in

4.4 The Mean Value Theorem

The difference between instantaneous and average rates of change has been discussed in ear-
lier sections. Recall that there is no difference between the two for linear functions. For
nonlinear functions the average rate of change over an interval [a, b] of positive length (i.e.
b - a > 0) will not be the same as the instantaneous rate of change at every point in the inter-
val. However, the following theorem guarantees that they will be the same at some point in
the interval:

Mean Value Theorem: Let a and b be real numbers such that a < b, and suppose that f
is a function such that
(a) f is continuous on [a, b], and

(b) f is differentiable on (a, b).
Then there is at least one number c in the interval (a, b) such that

                 f (c) = f (b) - f (a) .                                  (4.3)
                                b-a

Figure 4.4.1 below shows the geometric interpretation of the theorem:
                            y

f (b) slope = f (c) (b, f (b))

                                                    y = f (x)

                             slope = f (b) - f (a)
f (a)                                        b-a

                 (a, f (a))

                                                                       x

              a              c               b

Figure 4.4.1  Mean Value Theorem: parallel tangent line and secant line

   The idea is that there is at least one point on the curve y = f (x) where the tangent line will
be parallel to the secant line joining the points (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)). For each c in (a, b) the
tangent line has slope f (c), while the secant line has slope b-a f (b)-f (a) . The Mean Value Theorem
says that these two slopes will be equal somewhere in (a, b).

   To prove the Mean Value Theorem (sometimes called Lagrange's Theorem), the following
intermediate result is needed, and is important in its own right:
                                                   The Mean Value Theorem · Section 4.4 119

Rolle's Theorem: Let a and b be real numbers such that a < b, and suppose that f is a
function such that
(a) f is continuous on [a, b],

(b) f is differentiable on (a, b), and

(c) f (a) = f (b) = 0.
Then there is at least one number c in the interval (a, b) such that f (c) = 0.

Figure 4.4.2 on the right shows the geometric interpre- y

tation of the theorem. To prove the theorem, assume that             slope = f (c)

f is not the constant function f (x) = 0 for all x in [a, b] (if

it were then Rolle's Theorem would hold trivially). Then                               y = f (x)

there must be at least one x0 in (a, b) such that either                               x
f (x0) > 0 or f (x0) < 0. If f (x0) > 0 then by the Extreme
Value Theorem f attains a global maximum at some x = c            a    c            b

in the open interval (a, b), since f is zero at the endpoints        Figure 4.4.2

x = a and x = b of the closed interval [a, b]. Then f (c) = 0 since f has a maximum at x = c.

Likewise if f (x0) < 0 then f attains a global minimum at some x = c in (a, b), and thus again

f (c) = 0 .

The Mean Value Theorem can now be proved by applying Rolle's Theorem to the function

                                     F(x) = f (x) - f (a) - f (b) - f (a) (x - a)
                                                                         b-a

where f satisfies the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem. Basically, the function F "tilts"
the graph of f from Figure 4.4.1 to look like the graph in Figure 4.4.2. It is trivial to check
that F(a) = F(b) = 0, and F is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) since f is. Thus,
by Rolle's Theorem, F(c) = 0 for some c in (a, b). However,

                   F(x) = f (x) - f (b) - f (a)
                                              b-a

and so       F(c) = f (c) - f (b) - f (a) = 0  f (c) = f (b) - f (a)

                   b-a                                            b-a

Note that both the Mean Value Theorem and Rolle's Theorem are purely existence theorems;

they tell you only that a certain number exists. The task of finding the numbers is left to
you. For the Mean Value Theorem that task involves solving the equation f (x) = b-a f (b)-f (a) (or
f (x) = 0 for Rolle's Theorem). The numerical root-finding methods from Section 4.3 could come

in handy, since obtaining closed-form solutions might be impossible. For that reason, the Mean

Value Theorem is more useful for theoretical purposes. One such application is the following

important result:
120 Chapter 4 · Applications of Derivatives  §4.4

If f is a differentiable function on an interval I such that f (x) = 0 for all x in I, then f is a
constant function on I.

Note that I can be any interval, even the entire real line (-, ). It is already known that
f = constant  f  = 0; the above result says that the converse is true. The proof is by con-
tradiction: assume that f is not a constant function and show this contradicts the Mean Value
Theorem. If f is not constant then there exist numbers a < b in I such that f (a) = f (b). How-
ever, by the Mean Value Theorem there must exist a number c in the interval (a, b) such that

                                                   f (c) = f (b) - f (a) .
                                                                   b-a

Since the derivative of f is 0 everywhere in I, then f (c) = 0 and so

                        f (b) - f (a) = 0  f (b) - f (a) = 0  f (a) = f (b) ,
                            b-a

a contradiction of f (a) = f (b). Thus, f must be a constant function.
   Another theoretical result can be proved with the Mean Value Theorem:

  Let f be a differentiable function on an interval I. Then:
  (a) If f  > 0 on I then f is increasing on I.

  (b) If f  < 0 on I then f is decreasing on I.

To prove part (a), assume that f (x) > 0 for all x in I, and choose arbitrary numbers a and b
in I with a < b. To prove that f is increasing on I it suffices to show that f (a) < f (b). By the
Mean Value Theorem there is a number c in (a, b) (and hence in I) such that

                                             f (b) - f (a) = f (c) , and so
                                                b-a

                                             f (b) - f (a) = (b - a) f (c) > 0

since b - a > 0 and f (c) > 0. Thus, f (b) > f (a), and so f is increasing on I.
   The proof of part (b) is similar and is left as an exercise. You might wonder why such a proof

is necessary. After all, an intuitive explanation was provided in Section 1.2 for why positive
or negative derivatives imply that a function is increasing or decreasing, respectively. That
knowledge has been assumed and used in the subsequent sections. Intuitive so-called "hand-
waving" explanations, in fact, often yield more insight than a "formal" proof, such as the one
above. However, it is good to know that such intuition has a solid basis and can be proved, if
needed.

   The Mean Value Theorem can help in proving inequalities, often used in the sciences for
establishing upper or lower bounds on a quantity (e.g. worst-case scenario).

Example 4.16
Show that sin x  x for all x  0.
Solution: The inequality holds trivially for x = 0, since sin 0 = 0  0. So assume that x > 0. Then by the
Mean Value Theorem there is a number c in (0, x) such that for f (x) = sin x,

                                      f (x) - f (0) x - 0 = f (c)  sin x - sin 0 x - 0 = cos c
                                                                      sin x = x cos c
                                                                      sin x  x

since cos c  1 and x > 0. Note that sin x  x is a sharper inequality than sin x  1 when 0 < x < 1.

There is a useful alternative form of the Mean Value Theorem. If a < b then let h = b - a > 0,

so that a + h = b. Then any number c in (a, b) can be written as c = a +h for some number  in

(0, 1).  To  see  this,  let  c  be  in  (a, b).  Then  0<  c-a<  b-a=                       h  and  so  0<  c-a  < 1.  Thus,    =  c-a
                                                                                                              h                      h
is in (0, 1) and a + h = a + (c - a) = c. Hence:

Mean Value Theorem (alternative form): Let a and h > 0 be real numbers, and suppose
that f is a function such that
(a) f is continuous on [a, a + h], and

(b) f is differentiable on (a, a + h).
Then there is a number  in the interval (0, 1) such that

                                         f (a + h) - f (a) = h f (a + h) .                                                     (4.4)

The Mean Value Theorem is the special case of g(x) = x in the following generalization:

Extended Mean Value Theorem: Let a and b be real numbers such that a < b, and
suppose that f and g are functions such that

(a) f and g are continuous on [a, b],

(b) f and g are differentiable on (a, b), and

(c) g(x) = 0 for all x in (a, b).
Then there is at least one number c in the interval (a, b) such that

                                                  g f (c) = (c) f (b) - f (a) g(b) - g(a) .                                    (4.5)
122 Chapter 4 · Applications of Derivatives                                                       §4.4

   The Mean Value Theorem says that the derivative of a differentiable function will always
attain one particular value on a closed interval: the function's average rate of change over the
interval. It turns out that the derivative will take on every value between its values at the
endpoints, similar to how the Intermediate Value Theorem applies to continuous functions:11

    Darboux's Theorem: If f is a differentiable function on a closed interval [a, b] then its
    derivative f  attains every value between f (a) and f (b).

   In other words, if f (a) <  < f (b) (or f (b) <  < f (a)) then there is a number c in (a, b)
such that f (c) = . If f  were continuous on [a, b] then the result would follow trivially by
the Intermediate Value Theorem for continuous functions. What is perhaps surprising is that
Darboux's Theorem holds even for derivatives that are not continuous. This means that a
discontinuous derivative cannot have the type of simple jump discontinuities that would allow
it to "skip" over intermediate values--the points of discontinuity must be of a more complicated
type. One rough interpretation of Darboux's Theorem is that even if a derivative is not a
continuous function, it will behave sort of as if it were.

     This inequality is a generalization of the same inequality for 0  x1, x2 < 1 in the relativistic velocity
     addition law from the theory of special relativity: if object 1 has velocity v1 relative to a frame of
     reference F, and if object 2 has a velocity v2 relative to object 1, so that x1 = v1/c and x2 = v2/c
     represent the fractions of the speed of light c at which the objects are moving, then the fraction of

     the speed of light at which object 2 is moving with respect to F is x = (x1 + x2)/(1 + x1x2). So it should
     be true that 0  x < 1, since nothing can move faster than the speed of light.

                   The Integral

5.1 The Indefinite Integral

Derivatives appear in many physical phenomena, such as the motion of objects. Recall, for
example, that given the position function s(t) of an object moving along a straight line at time
t, you could find the velocity v(t) = s(t) and the acceleration a(t) = v(t) of the object at time t
by taking derivatives. Suppose the situation were reversed: given the velocity function how
would you find the position function, or given the acceleration function how would you find the
velocity function?

     Figure 5.1.1  Differentiation vs antidifferentiation for motion functions

   In this case calculating a derivative would not help, since the reverse process is needed:
instead of differentiation you need a way of performing antidifferentiation, i.e. you would
calculate an antiderivative.

An antiderivative F(x) of a function f (x) is a function whose derivative is f (x). In other
words, F(x) = f (x).

   Differentiation is relatively straightforward. You have learned the derivatives of many
classes of functions (e.g. polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic
functions), and with the various rules for differentiation you can calculate derivatives of com-
plicated expressions involving those functions (e.g. sums, powers, products, quotients). Antid-
ifferentiation, however, is a different story.

   To see some of the issues involved, consider a simple function like f (x) = 2x. Of course you
know that ddx (x2) = 2x, so it seems that F(x) = x2 is the antiderivative of f (x) = 2x. But is it
the only antiderivative of f (x)? No. For example, if F(x) = x2 + 1 then F(x) = 2x = f (x), and so
F(x) = x2 + 1 is another antiderivative of f (x) = 2x. Likewise, so is F(x) = x2 + 2. In fact, any
function of the form F(x) = x2 + C, where C is some constant, is an antiderivative of f (x) = 2x.

   Another potential issue is that functions of the form F(x) = x2 + C are just the most obvious
antiderivatives of f (x) = 2x. Could there be some other completely different function--one that
cannot be simplified into the form x2 + C--whose derivative also turns out to be f (x) = 2x? The
answer, luckily, is no:

  Suppose that F(x) and G(x) are antiderivatives of a function f (x). Then F(x) and G(x) differ
  only by a constant. That is, F(x) = G(x) + C for some constant C.

   To prove this, consider the function H(x) = F(x)-G(x), defined for all x in the common domain
I of F and G. Since F(x) = G(x) = f (x), then

                                    H(x) = F(x) - G(x) = f (x) - f (x) = 0
for all x in I, so H(x) is a constant function on I, as was shown in Section 4.4 on the Mean
Value Theorem. Thus, there is a constant C such that

                        H(x) = C  F(x) - G(x) = C  F(x) = G(x) + C
for all x in I.

   The practical consequence of the above result can be stated as follows:

  To find all antiderivatives of a function, it is necessary only to find one antiderivative and
  then add a generic constant to it.

   So for the function f (x) = 2x, since F(x) = x2 is one antiderivative then all antiderivatives of
f (x) are of the form F(x) = x2 + C, where C is a generic constant. Thus, functions do not have
just one antiderivative but a whole family of antiderivatives, all differing only by a constant.
The following notation makes all this easier to express:

  The indefinite integral of a function f (x) is denoted by

                                                              f (x) dx

  and represents the entire family of antiderivatives of f (x).

The large S-shaped symbol before f (x) is called an integral sign.
126 Chapter 5 · The Integral                                                   §5.1

   Though the indefinite integral f (x) dx represents all antiderivatives of f (x), the integral
can be thought of as a single object or function in its own right, whose derivative is f (x):

                d f (x) dx = f (x)
                dx

   You might be wondering what the integral sign in the indefinite integral represents, and
why an infinitesimal dx is included. It has to do with what an infinitesimal represents: an in-
finitesimal "piece" of a quantity. For an antiderivative F(x) of a function f (x), the infinitesimal
(or differential) dF is given by dF = F(x) dx = f (x) dx, and so

                F(x) = f (x) dx = dF .

The integral sign thus acts as a summation symbol: it sums up the infinitesimal "pieces" dF
of the function F(x) at each x so that they add up to the entire function F(x). Think of it as
similar to the usual summation symbol  used for discrete sums; the integral sign takes the
sum of a continuum of infinitesimal quantities instead.

   Finding (or evaluating) the indefinite integral of a function is called integrating the func-
tion, and integration is antidifferentiation.

Example 5.1

Evaluate 0 dx.

Solution: Since the derivative of any constant function is 0, then  0 dx = C, where C is a generic
constant.

Note: From now on C will simply be assumed to represent a generic constant, without having to explic-
itly say so every time.

Example 5.2

Evaluate 1 dx.                                                 1 dx = x + C.
Solution: Since the derivative of F(x) = x is F(x) = 1, then

Example 5.3

Evaluate x dx.

                x2                                                         x2
Solution: Since the derivative of F(x) = 2 is F (x) = x, then
                                                               x dx = 2 + C.

   Since dx n+ d x 1 n+1 = xn for any number n = -1, and dxd (ln |x|) = x1 = x-1, then any power of x can
be integrated:

Power Formula:              

                    ln|x| + C

   The following rules for indefinite integrals are immediate consequences of the rules for
derivatives:

  Let f and g be functions and let k be a constant. Then:
  1. k f (x) dx = k f (x) dx

  2. ( f (x) + g(x)) dx = f (x) dx + g(x) dx

  3. ( f (x) - g(x)) dx = f (x) dx - g(x) dx

   The above rules are easily proved. For example, the first rule is a simple consequence of the
Constant Multiple Rule for derivatives: if F(x) = f (x) dx, then

d (k F(x)) = k d (F(x)) = k f (x)           k f (x) dx = k F(x) = k f (x) dx .
dx              dx

The other rules are proved similarly and are left as exercises. Repeated use of the above rules
along with the Power Formula shows that any polynomial can be integrated term by term--in
fact any finite sum of functions can be integrated in that manner:

For any functions f1, . . ., fn and constants k1, . . ., kn,                               (5.1)
                   (k1 f1(x) + · · · + kn fn(x)) dx = k1 f1(x) dx + · · · + kn fn(x) dx .

   The following indefinite integrals are just re-statements of the corresponding derivative for-
mulas for the six basic trigonometric functions:

                                   cos x dx = sin x + C
                                   sin x dx = - cos x + C
                                  sec2 x dx = tan x + C
                            sec x tan x dx = sec x + C

                                  csc2 x dx = - cot x + C

Since ddx (ex) = ex, then:

                                                       ex dx = ex + C

Evaluate (3 sin x + 4 cos x - 5ex) dx.
Solution: Integrate term by term:

                        (3 sin x + 4 cos x - 5ex) dx = 3

                                                        = -3 cos x + 4 sin x - 5ex + C

Example 5.8

Recall from Section 1.1 the example of an object dropped from a height of 100 ft. Show that the height
s(t) of the object t seconds after being dropped is s(t) = -16t2 + 100, measured in feet.

Solution: When the object is dropped at time t = 0 the only force acting on it is                      100 ft  t = 0 sec
gravity, causing the object to accelerate downward at the known constant rate of
32 ft/s2. The object's acceleration a(t) at time t is thus a(t) = -32. If v(t) is the                              t>0
object's velocity at time t, then v(t) = a(t), which means that                                                s(t)

                           v(t) = a(t) dt = -32 dt = -32t + C

for some constant C. The constant C here is not generic--it has a specific
value determined by the initial condition on the velocity: the object was at rest at time t = 0. That is,
v(0) = 0, which means

                                      0 = v(0) = -32(0) + C = C  v(t) = -32t

for all t  0. Likewise, since s(t) = v(t) then

                                   s(t) = v(t) dt = -32t dt = -16t2 + C

for some constant C, determined by the initial condition that the object was 100 ft above the ground at
time t = 0. That is, s(0) = 100, which means

                              100 = s(0) = -16(0)2 + C = C  s(t) = -16t2 + 100

for all t  0.

   The formula for s(t) in Example 5.8 can be generalized as follows: denote the object's initial
position at time t = 0 by s0, let v0 be the object's initial velocity (positive if thrown upward,
negative if thrown downward), and let g represent the (positive) constant acceleration due to
gravity. By Newton's First Law of motion the only acceleration imparted to the object after
throwing it is due to gravity:

                     a(t) = -g  v(t) = a(t) dt = -g dt = -gt + C

for some constant C: v0 = v(0) = -g(0) + C = C. Thus, v(t) = -gt + v0 for all t  0, and so

                     s(t) =        v(t) dt =            (- g t  +  v0)  dt  =  - 1 gt2  +  v0 t  +  C

                                                                                  2

for  some  constant  C:  s0  =  s  (0)  =  -  1  g(0)2  + v0(0) + C     =  C.  To  summarize:

                                          position:      v(t) = -gt + v0

                              initial conditions:        s(t)  =  - 1 gt2   +  v0 t  +  s0

                                                                     2

                                                         s0 = s(0) , v0 = v(0)

Note that the units are not specified--they just need to be consistent. In metric units, g = 9.8
m/s2, while g = 32 ft/s2 in English units.

   Thinking of the indefinite integral of a function as the sum of all the infinitesimal "pieces" of
that function--for the purpose of retrieving that function--provides a handy way of integrat-
ing a differential equation to obtain the solution. The key idea is to transform the differential
equation into an equation of differentials, which has the effect of treating functions as vari-
ables. Some examples will illustrate the technique.

Example 5.9

For  any  constant  k,  show  that  every  solution  of  the  differential  equation  dy  = ky  is  of  the  form  y=  Aekt
                                                                                      dt
for some constant A. You can assume that y(t) > 0 for all t.

Solution: Put the y terms on the left and the t terms on the right, i.e. separate the variables:

                                                                 dy
                                                                  y = k dt
Now integrate both sides (notice how the function y is treated as a variable):

                                dy
                                 y = k dt

                        ln y + C1 = kt + C2 (C1 and C2 are constants)
                              ln y = kt + C (combine C1 and C2 into the constant C)
                                  y = ekt+C = ekt · eC = Aekt

where A = eC is a constant. Note that this is the formula for radioactive decay from Section 2.3.

Example 5.10
Recall from Section 3.6 the equation of differentials

                                                            dP dV dT
                                                             P+V =T
relating the pressure P, volume V and temperature T of an ideal gas. Integrate that equation to obtain
the original ideal gas law PV = RT, where R is a constant. .

                             dP  dV  dT
                             P+ V = T

                             ln P + ln V = ln T + C (C is a constant)
                                   ln (PV ) = ln T + C
                                        PV = eln T+C = eln T · eC = T eC = RT

where R = eC is a constant.

   The integration formulas in this section depended on already knowing the derivatives of cer-
tain functions and then "working backward" from their derivatives to obtain the original func-
tions. Without that prior knowledge you would be reduced to guessing, or perhaps recognizing
a pattern from some derivative you have encountered. A number of integration techniques will
be presented shortly, but there are many indefinite integrals for which no simple closed form
exists (e.g. ex2 dx and sin(x2) dx).

5.2 The Definite Integral

Recall from the last section that the integral sign in the indefinite integral

                                                              f (x) dx

represents a summation of the infinitesimals f (x) dx = dF for an antiderivative F(x) of f (x).
Why is the term "indefinite" used? Because the summation is indefinite: the x in f (x) dx is
defined generically, meaning "x in general," that is, not for x in a specific range of values. The
same summation over a specific, definite range of values of x, say, over an interval [a, b], is a
different type of integral:

The definite integral of a function f (x) over an interval [a, b] is denoted by

                                                                             b

                                                            f (x) dx

                                                                           a

and represents the sum of the infinitesimals f (x) dx for all x in [a, b].

   An indefinite integral yields a generic function, whereas a definite integral yields either a
number or a specific function. There are many ways to calculate the specific summation in a
definite integral, one of which is motivated by a geometric interpretation of the infinitesimal

   Figure 5.2.1 The infinitesimal f (x) dx as the area of a rectangle

   The shaded rectangle in the above picture has height f (x) and width dx, and so its area is
f (x) dx. In fact, it appears that that area is just a little bit smaller than the area under the
curve y = f (x) and above the x-axis between x and x + dx; there is a small gap between the
curve and the top of the rectangle, accounting for the difference in the area. However, the area
of that gap turns out to be zero, as shown below:

              Area under the curve y = f (x) over [x, x + dx]

   By the Microstraightness Property, the curve y = f (x) shown in Figure 5.2.1 is a straight line
over the infinitesimal interval [x, x + dx], as shown in Figure 5.2.2.1 Thus, the part of the area
between the curve and the x-axis over the interval [x, x + dx] consists of two parts: the area
f (x) dx of the shaded rectangle and the area of the right triangle ABC, both of which are
shown in Figure 5.2.2. However, the area of ABC is zero:

     Area of ABC = 12 (base) × (height) = 12 (dx)(df ) = 12 (dx)( f (x) dx) = 12 f (x)(dx)2 = 0

The function f shown in Figure 5.2.2 is increasing at x, but a similar argument could be made
if f were decreasing at x. Hence, the area between the curve y = f (x) and the x-axis comes
solely from the rectangles with area f (x) dx, as x varies from a to b. The sum of all those
rectangular areas, though, equals the definite integral of f (x) over [a, b]. The definite integral
can thus be interpreted as an area:

For a function f (x)  0 over [a, b], the area under the curve y = f (x) between x = a and
x = b, denoted by A, is given by

                                                                                 b

                                                    A = f (x) dx

                                                                                a

and represents the area of the region R bounded above by y = f (x), bounded below by the
x-axis, and bounded on the sides by x = a and x = b (with a < b).

 1The function f is assumed to be differentiable at x, in this case. If not then the points where f is not differentiable
can be excluded without affecting the integral.

   In Figure 5.2.3 the area under the curve y = f (x) between x = a and x = b is the area A of
the shaded region R, namely A = ab f (x) dx. To calculate that area for a specific function, rect-
angles can again be used, but this time with widths that are small positive numbers instead

of infinitesimals. The procedure is as follows:

1. Create a partition P = {x0 < x1 < · · · < xn-1 < xn} of the interval [a, b] into n  1 subintervals
    [x0, x1], [x1, x2], . . ., [xn-1, xn], with x0 = a and xn = b.

2. In each subinterval [xi-1, xi] of P pick a number xi , so that xi-1  xi  xi for i = 1 to n.

3. For i = 1 to n, form a rectangle whose base is the subinterval [xi-1, xi] of length xi =
    xi - xi-1 > 0 and whose height is f (xi ).

4. Take the sum f (x1)x1 + f (x2)x2 + · · · + f (xn)xn of the areas of these rectangles, called a
    Riemann sum.

5. Take the limit of the Riemann sums as n  , so that the subinterval lengths approach 0.
    If the limit exists then that limit is the area A of the region R:

                                                       b                n

   The limit in Formula (5.2) should be taken over all partitions whose norm--the length of
the largest subinterval--approaches 0. In practice, however, the partitions are usually chosen
so that the subintervals are of equal length, and then simply make those equal lengths smaller
and smaller by dividing the interval [a, b] into more and more such subintervals. Note that
the points xi in each subinterval can be anywhere in the subinterval--often the midpoint of
the subinterval is chosen, but the left and right endpoints are also typical choices.

   In the above procedure the gaps between the rectangles and the curve will have areas ap-
proaching 0 as the number n of subintervals grows and the subinterval lengths approach 0.
This is true if the function f is differentiable, and in fact even if f is merely continuous.2 Thus,
the area under the curve can be defined by the above procedure.

   To calculate the area under a curve in this manner, the reader should have some familiarity
with the summation notation in Formula (5.2).

  For real numbers a1, a2, . . ., an and an integer n  1,

                                                             n

                                                  ak = a1 + a2 + ··· + an

                                                            k=1

  is the sum of a1, . . ., an. The symbol  is called the summation sign, which is the Greek
  capital letter Sigma.

The following rules for this "Sigma notation" are intuitively obvious:

Let a1, a2, . . ., an, and b1, b2, . . ., bn be real numbers, and let c be a constant. Then:

n            n    n
(1) (ak + bk) = ak + bk
k=1          k=1  k=1

n            n    n
(2) (ak - bk) = ak - bk
k=1          k=1  k=1

n         n

(3) cak = c ak
k=1     k=1

n    n          (i.e. the sum is independent of the summation index letter)

(4) ak = ai
k=1  i=1

 2For a proof and fuller discussion of all this, see Ch.1-2 in KNOPP, M.I., Theory of Area, Chicago: Markham
Publishing Co., 1969. The book attempts to define precisely what an "area" actually means, including that of a
rectangle (showing agreement with the intuitive notion of width times height).

          k = 1 + 2 + · · · + n + (n + 1) = k + (n + 1)

   It it often simpler to use a computer to calculate approximations of a definite integral, by
taking the Riemann sum of a sufficiently large number of rectangles in order to achieve the
desired accuracy. Choosing subintervals of equal length, as in Example 5.11, makes it easier
to use an algorithm to calculate the integral.

   For example, the table below summarizes the calculations of Riemann sums for the function
in Example 5.11--namely f (x) = x2 over [1, 2]--using different values for the points xi in the
subintervals (left endpoints, midpoints, and right endpoints):

   Due to the concavity of the curve y = x2, using the left endpoints underestimates the actual
area, whereas using the right endpoints yields an overestimate. Using the midpoints usually
gives better results (i.e. more accuracy in fewer iterations).

   So far only definite integrals of nonnegative functions have been considered--that is, func-
tions f (x)  0 over an interval [a, b]. If f (x) is either negative or changes sign over [a, b], then
the definite integral can be defined as follows:

Let R be the region bounded by y = f (x) and the x-axis between x = a and x = b. If f (x)  0
over [a, b], then

                                               b

                                      f (x) dx = the negative of the area of R

5.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Using Riemann sums to calculate definite integrals can be tedious, as was seen in the previous
section. In fact the technique shown in that section depended on the function being a low-
degree polynomial, which obviously will not always be the case. Luckily there is a better way,
involving antiderivatives, given by the following theorem:

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Suppose that a function f is differentiable on
[a, b]. Then:

   (I) The function A(x) defined on [a, b] by

   is differentiable on [a, b], and                      x
   for all x in [a, b].
                                       A(x) = f (t) dt

                                                       a

                                          A(x) = f (x)

(II) If F is an antiderivative of f on [a, b], i.e. F(x) = f (x) for all x in [a, b], then

                                        b

                                          f (x) dx = F(b) - F(a) .

                                       a

   The function A(x) in Part I of the theorem is sometimes called the area function because it
represents the area under the curve y = f (x) over the interval [a, x], as shown in Figure 5.3.1
below.

y                                                   y

      y = f (x)                                                     y = f (x)

      A(x)                                                          dA

                                       x                                                    x
                                       ax f (t) dt
   a        x    b                                     a            x x + dx b

Figure 5.3.1 The area function A(x) =               Figure 5.3.2 dA = A(x + dx) - A(x)

   To prove Part I, assume that f (x)  0 on [a, b] as in Figure 5.3.1 (the proofs for f (x) either
negative or switching sign over [a, b] are similar). The goal is to show that for any x in [a, b]
the differential dA exists and equals f (x) dx. First, dA = A(x + dx) - A(x) is the area under the
curve y = f (x) over the interval [x, x + dx], as shown in Figure 5.3.2 above.

   By the Microstraightness Property the curve y = f (x) is a straight line over the infinitesimal
interval [x, x + dx], so f must be either increasing, constant, or decreasing over that interval.
The three possibilities are shown in Figure 5.3.3:

                y = f (x)    B                                   y = f (x)                       A y = f (x)

                                     Figure 5.3.3 The three possibilities for dA

In the case where f is increasing over [x, x + dx], the infinitesimal area dA is the sum of the

area of the rectangle of height f (x) and width dx and the area of the right triangle ABC
                                                                     1 (df           1       (x)(dx)2
shown    in  Figure     5.3.3(a).    The    area  of  ABC        is         )(dx) =  2    f            = 0,  so  dA  =  f  (x) dx.
                                                                     2
In the case where f is constant over [x, x + dx], the infinitesimal area dA is the area of the

rectangle of height f (x) and width dx, as shown in Figure 5.3.3(b). So again, dA = f (x) dx.

In the case where f is decreasing over [x, x + dx], the infinitesimal area dA is the sum of the

area of the rectangle of height f (x + dx) and width dx and the area of the right triangle ABC

shown in Figure 5.3.3(c). Note that df < 0 since f is decreasing, and so the area of ABC is
21 (-df              1     (x)(dx)2
         )(dx) =        f            =  0.  Thus,
                  -2

    dA = f (x + dx) dx = ( f (x) + df ) dx = f (x) dx + f (x)(dx)2 = f (x) dx + 0 = f (x) dx .

So  in   all    three   cases,  dA   =  f   (x)  dx,  and    so  A(x)  =  dA  =  f  (x),  which  shows  that     A(x)   is  differen-
                                                                          dx
tiable and has derivative f (x). This proves Part I of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

To prove Part II of the theorem, let F(x) be an antiderivative of f (x) over [a, b]. Since the are

afunction A(x) = ax f (x) dx is also an antiderivative of f (x) over [a, b] by Part I of the theorem,
then A(x) and F(x) differ by a constant C over [a, b]. In other words:

                                           A(x) = F(x) + C for all x in [a, b]
142 Chapter 5 · The Integral                                                             §5.3

   By definition A(a) = 0, since it is the area under the curve over the interval [a, a] of zero
length. Thus,

0 = A(a) = F(a) + C  C = -F(a)  A(x) = F(x) - F(a) for all x in [a, b]

and so                      b

which proves Part II of the theorem.3
   Note: In some textbooks Part I is called the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Part

II is called the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The following notation provides a
shorthand way of writing F(b) - F(a):

                                            b

                                  F(x) = F(b) - F(a)

Example 5.12

                      2

Calculate x2 dx.

                    1

Solution: Recall from Example 5.11 in the previous section that the integral equals 7/3. In that example

Riemann sums were used, but Part II of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus makes the integral much
                           x3
easier to calculate. Since F(x) = 3 is an antiderivative of f (x) = x , then2

                                  x 2 2 dx = x = - = 3 . 2 23 13 7
                               1     31 3 3 3

   Note in the above example that any antiderivative of f (x) = x2 could have been used, e.g.

             x3

F(x) = 3 + 5. Notice that the constant 5 cancels out when evaluating F(2) - F(1). So you do
not need to add a generic constant C to the antiderivative of f (x) in a definite integral, as you
would in an indefinite integral.

Example 5.13

                       

Calculate sin x dx.

                    0

Solution: Since F(x) = - cos x is an antiderivative of f (x) = sin x, then

                                  

              0            sin x dx = - cos x = - cos  - (- cos 0) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2 .

Example 5.14 is a special case of the following result for odd functions:

If f is an odd function, i.e. f (-x) = - f (x) for all x, then

                                                                        a

                                                         f (x) dx = 0

                                                                      -a

for all a > 0 such that f is continuous on [-a, a].

   The idea is that since an odd function is symmetric around the origin, then the area between
the curve and the x-axis over [0, a] will cancel out the area between the curve and the x-axis
over [-a, 0]. Both areas are the same but one gets counted as positive and the other negative,
as shown in Figure 5.3.4 below:

   The following results for definite integrals are a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus:

Let f be a continuous function on [a, b] and suppose that a < c < b. Then:

      f (x) dx + f (x) dx = (F(c) - F(a)) + (F(b) - F(c)) = F(b) - F(a) = f (x) dx

5.4 Integration by Substitution

The integrals encountered so far--whether indefinite or definite--have been the simplest kind,

since the antiderivatives had known formulas. For example, cos x dx = sin x + C. What if the

integral were cos 2x dx instead? No formula has been discussed yet for this integral, and the

answer is not sin 2x+C, since the derivative of sin 2x is 2 cos 2x, not cos 2x. But dividing sin 2x
                                                                                       1
by 2 first and then taking the derivative would yield cos 2x, so that  cos  2x  dx  =  2  sin  2x  +  C.

Evaluating an integral in such a manner is often done when the function is not too compli-

cated, as the one above. Usually it will not be quite that simple, and so a general technique

called substitution is needed. The idea behind substitution is to replace part of the function

being integrated by a new variable--typically u--so that a complicated function of x is now a

simpler function of u that you know how to integrate.

Example 5.16

Evaluate cos 2x dx by substitution.

Solution: The 2x in the cosine function is what makes this integral unknown, so replace it by u: let
u = 2x. The integral is now

                                                                   cos u dx

which is a problem because the point of doing substitution is to eliminate all references to the variable
x, including in the infinitesimal dx. The entire integral needs to be in terms of u and du, but the dx is
still there. So put dx in terms of du:

                          u = 2x  du = 2dx  dx = 12 du

The integral now becomes

                          cos u 12 du = 12 cos u du = 12 sin u + C

by the formula already known, just with the letter u as the variable instead of x. The original integral
was in terms of x, so the final answer--for an indefinite integral--should also be in terms of x. Thus,
the final step is to substitute back into the answer what u equals in terms of x, namely 2x:

                          cos 2x dx = 12 sin u + C = 12 sin 2x + C

   If the procedure in the above example seems similar to making a substitution when using
the Chain Rule to take a derivative, that is because it is similar: you are basically doing the
same thing only in reverse. Just as for differentiation, it is not always obvious what part of
the function is the best candidate for substitution when performing integration. There is one
obvious rule: never make the substitution u = x, because that changes nothing.
                                                  Integration by Substitution · Section 5.4 147

Example 5.17

Evaluate e-3x dx.
Solution: The -3x in the exponential function is what makes this integral unknown, so make the
substitution u = -3x, which means that du = -3dx, and so dx = - 13 du. Thus:

                        e-3x dx = eu - 13 du = - 13 eu du = - 13 eu + C = - 13 e-3x + C

The above example can be generalized as follows:
                                    eax dx = 1 eax + C for any constant a = 0
                                                  a

Example 5.17 was the special case with a = -3.

Example 5.18

Evaluate (1 + 4x)5 dx.

Solution: You might be tempted to make the substitution u = 4x, but that would then require finding
the integral of (1 + u)5, for which there is not yet any formula. But there is a formula for the integral of
u5.                                                     1 du.
     Hence, let u = 1 + 4x, so that   du = 4dx    dx =         Thus:
                                                        4

                          (1 + 4x)5 dx = 14     u5 du = 1 u + C = 6 1 (1 + 4x)6 + C
                                                        46                 24

Example 5.19

Evaluate 2x ex2 dx.

Solution: It might be unclear whether you should make the substitution u = 2x or u = x2, but the hint
here is that the derivative of the x2 inside the exponential function is 2x, which appears outside the

exponential function. Indeed, you could check that letting u = 2x would result in an integral no simpler
                                   1  u eu2/4 du). So let u = x2, which means du = 2x dx. Thus:
than  the  current  one  (namely,  2

                                   2x ex2 dx = eu du = eu + C = ex2 + C

Example 5.20

Evaluate x 1 + 3x2 dx.

Solution: Note that the derivative of the 1 + 3x2 term inside the square root function is 6x, which is

almost the function x outside the square root--all that is missing is the constant multiple 6. That is a
hint to let u = 1 + 3x2.                                           1
                          Notice also that du = 6x dx     x dx  =  6  du,  and  x dx  is  the  remaining  part  of  the

integral outside the square root. Thus:

                    x 1 + 3x2 dx = 16           u du = 1 u + C = 3/2 1 (1 + 3x2)3/2 + C

Example 5.22
Evaluate x2 2x dx - 1 .
Solution: Notice that the numerator 2x in the function is exactly the derivative of the denominator
x2 - 1. That is a hint to substitute on the denominator so that the integral is the natural logarithm
function. Let u = x2 - 1, so that du = 2x dx. Thus:

                                  2x dx       du = ln |u| + C = ln |x2 - 1| + C
                                  x2 - 1 =    u

Example 5.23

Evaluate tan x dx.

Solution:  Notice  that  tan x =  sin x  and  that  the  numerator  sin x  is   almost  the  derivative  of  the  denom-
                                  cos x
inator cos x; all that is missing is a negative sign. That is a hint to substitute on the denominator:

u = cos x, so that du = - sin x dx  sin x dx = -du. Thus:

tan x dx =               sin x
                         cos x dx

                   = -du = - ln |u| + C = - ln |cos x| + C = ln |cos x|-1 + C = ln |sec x| + C
                            u

Evaluate sec x dx.

Solution: Notice that

                   sec x dx =            sec x (sec x + tan x) dx =      sec x tan x + sec2 x

and that the numerator in the last integral is the derivative of the denominator: let u = sec x + tan x,
so that du = (sec x tan x + sec2 x) dx. Thus:

                         sec x dx =           du = ln |u| + C = ln |sec x + tan x| + C

   The following formulas are straightforward consequences of substitution and the derivatives
of inverse trigonometric functions discussed in Section 2.2:

For any constant a > 0:

                                               a2 + x2 dx = 1a tan-1 xa + C

                                               dx = 1 sec-1 x + C (if |x| > a)

For example, to prove the second formula, recall that                              d   tan-1 x         = 1+x1 2 . Make the substi-
                                                                                   dx
tution u = x/a, so that x = au and dx = a du. Thus:

              dx                    a du         1      1 + u2 du = 1a tan-1 u + C = 1a tan-1 xa + C

Example 5.25

Evaluate             dx .
                  4 - 9x2
Solution: The 4 - 9x2 inside the square root is almost of the form a2 - x2, except for the 9. The goal is to
      u2     9x2,                                                    1             u2     9x2.
have      =        so   let  u  =  3x,  which  means    that  dx  =  3  du    and      =        Thus,

                                dx        1      du 4 - u2 = 13 sin-1 u2 + C = 13 sin-1 3x2 + C
                             4 - 9x2 = 3

by Formula (5.2) with a = 2.

   To use substitution with definite integrals, follow the same procedure as with indefinite

integrals but add one extra step: replace the limits of integration x = a and x = b in the original
integral ab f (x) dx by u = g(a) and u = g(b), respectively, in the new integral involving u, where
u = g(x) is your substitution.

Example 5.26

                     2

Evaluate (2x + 1)3 dx.

                   1

Solution:    Let  u  =  g(x)  =    2x+1,  which  means  that  dx     =  1  du.  The    upper    limit  of  integration  x  =  2  becomes
                                                                        2
u = g(2) = 2(2) + 1 = 5 in the new u-based integral, while the lower limit of integration x = 1 becomes

u = g(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3. Thus:

                                   2 (2x + 1)3 dx = 1      5 u3 du = 1 u4          5 = 1 (54 - 34) = 68

Note that you could have put everything back in terms of x at the end, but there was no need to since
you would get the same numerical answer.
150 Chapter 5 · The Integral                                                              §5.4

   The following property of definite integrals comes in handy for evaluating certain types of
definite integrals:

For any constant a,                a              a

                                      f (x) dx = f (a - x) dx .                           (5.6)
                                0        0

   This is simple to prove, using the substitution u = a- x, so x = a-u and dx = -du, while x = 0
becomes u = a and x = a becomes u = 0 in the limits of integration:

                  a          0              a                       a

5.5 Improper Integrals

Definite integrals so far have been defined only for continuous functions over finite closed
intervals. There are times when you will need to perform integration despite those conditions
not being met. For example, in quantum mechanics the Dirac delta function4  is defined on R
by four properties:

                                                                                                                   
(1): (x) = 0 for all x = 0 y

(2): (0) = 

(3):      (x) dx = 1

      -                                                                                                    x
                                                                                 0
(4): For any continuous function f on R,                             Figure 5.5.1 y = (x)

               

               f (x) (x) dx = f (0).

              -

   Properties (3) and (4) provide examples of one type of improper integral: an integral over
an infinite interval (in this case the entire real line R = (-, )). Define this type of improper
integral as follows:

For a continuous function f and a real number a, define the improper integral of f over

[a, ) by

                                                  b
                            f (x) dx = lim f (x) dx ,
                                             b a
                         a

define the improper integral of f over (-, a] by

                         a  f (x) dx = lim        a      f (x) dx ,

                         -                   b- b

and define the improper integral of f over (-, ) by

                         f (x) dx =       c  f (x) dx +       f (x) dx ,

                      -              -                   c

for any real number c (typically c = 0). If the given limit exists (i.e. is a real number) then
the improper integral is convergent; otherwise it is divergent.

 4Created by the physicist P.A.M. Dirac (1902-1984), who won a Nobel Prize in physics in 1933. The function is
neither real-valued nor continuous at x = 0. The "graph" in Figure 5.5.1 is perhaps misleading, as  is not an
actual point on the y-axis. One interpretation is that  is an abstraction of an instantaneous pulse or burst of
something, preceded and followed by nothing. To learn more about this fascinating and useful function, see §15 in
DIRAC, P.A.M., The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, 4th ed., Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1958.

   The limits in the above definitions are always taken after evaluating the integral inside
the limit. Just as for "proper" definite integrals, improper integrals can be interpreted as
representing the area under a curve.

and so the integral is divergent. This means that the area under the 0 1

curve y = 1/x over the interval [1,)--as shown in the graph above--is infinite.

This means that the area under the curve y = 1/x2 over the interval [1,)--as shown in the graph
above--equals 1. Thus, an infinite region can have a finite area. Length and area are different and
not necessarily related concepts, as this example illustrates. Notice that y = 1/x2 approaches the x-axis
asymptote much faster than y = 1/x does--fast enough to make the integral convergent.

then the integral is divergent, since limb cos b does not exist -1
(cos b oscillates between 1 and -1). This means that the net area
over [0,)--counted as positive above the x-axis and negative below--is indeterminate.

This  means    that  the  area  under    the  curve  y=    1      over  the  entire  real  line  (-, )--as    shown  in  the
                                                         1+x2
graph above--equals . Note that if the integral were split at any number c then the answer would

be the same. Another way to evaluate the integral would have been to use the symmetry around the
                       1
y-axis--as  f (x) =  1+x2  is  an  even  function--so  that

                                - 1 + x2 =  dx 2 0 1 + x2 = · · · =  dx 2(/2 - 0) =  .

Since the integrand is continuous over R, a common way of evaluating the integral--especially among
students--is to simply use ± as actual limits of integration, thus avoiding the need to take a limit:

                      dx 2 = tan-1  x = tan-1() - tan-1(-) =  - - = 
                     - 1 + x                    -                                          22

This type of shortcut is fine as long as you are aware of what plugging x = ± into tan-1 x actually
means, and that there are no numbers for which the integrand is undefined (which would yield an
improper integral of a different type, to be discussed shortly).
                                                            Improper Integrals · Section 5.5 155

   The second type of improper integral is of a function not continuous or not bounded over its
interval of integration. For example, the integral in property (3) of the Dirac delta function is
of that type, since  is discontinuous at x = 0. Define this type of improper integral as follows:

For a function f that is continuous on [a, b) but has either a discontinuity or vertical asymp-
tote at x = b, define the improper integral of f over [a, b) by

                                  b                         c
                                     f (x) dx = lim f (x) dx .
                                           cb- a
                               a

Likewise, if f is continuous on (a, b] but has either a discontinuity or vertical asymptote at
x = a, then define the improper integral of f over (a, b] by

                               b                            b
                                     f (x) dx = lim f (x) dx .
                                           ca+ c
                               a

If f is continuous on [a, b] but has either a discontinuity or vertical asymptote at x = c for
a < c < b, then define the improper integral of f over [a, b] by

                          b             c                         b
                               f (x) dx = f (x) dx + f (x) dx ,

                       a             a                         c

where the integrals on the right are evaluated as in the first two definitions. If the given
limit exists (i.e. is a real number) then the improper integral is convergent; otherwise it
is divergent.
Adjust these definitions accordingly for infinite intervals--e.g. [a, ), (-, b], or
(-, )--to be consistent with the definitions of improper integrals of that type.

and so the integral is divergent. This means that the area under the curve y = 1/x 0 1
over the interval (0,1]--as shown in the graph above--is infinite. The region is infinite in the y direction.

Solution: Recall from Example 3.22 in Section 3.3 that the floor function y

y = x has jump discontinuities at each integer value of x, as shown
                                                                              3  2

in the graph on the right. The integral 1 x dx is thus an improper
integral over the interval [1,3), which needs to be split at the point of

discontinuity x = 2 within that interval:                                        1

Similar to some of the above examples, the following result is easy to prove (see the exercises):

  For any real number a > 0, the improper integral
                                                                dx

  is convergent if p > 1, and divergent if 0 < p  1.
                                                    Improper Integrals · Section 5.5 157

The following test for convergence or divergence is sometimes helpful:

Comparison Test for Improper Integrals:                                                    a f (x) dx is
(a) If | f (x)|  g(x) for all x in [a, ), and if a g(x) dx is convergent, then

     convergent.

(b) If f (x)  g(x)  0 for all x in [a, ), and if a g(x) dx is divergent, then a f (x) dx is
     divergent.

   The idea behind part (a) is that if -g(x)  f (x)  g(x) over [a, ), then--thinking of improper
integrals as areas--the integral of f is "squeezed" between the two finite integrals for ±g.
There are, however, some subtle issues to prove about the limit in the integral of f --finite
bounds might not necessarily mean the limit exists.5

Example 5.36                                                                            1         sin x
Show that 1 x2 dx  sin x is convergent.                                                            x2
Solution: By Example 5.29, the integral 1 1x2 dx is convergent. So y           y = x2
since |sin x|  1 for all x, then                                                                        x
                                                                          1
                             x2 sin x  x21 0                                  y = - 1x2

for all x in [1, ). Thus, by the Comparison Test, 1 sinx2x dx is
convergent.  The  graph  on  the  right  shows how  the curve      sin x
                                                               y=   x2

is bounded between the curves y = ± 1x2 .

   The rules and properties from Section 5.3 concerning definite integrals still apply to im-

proper integrals, provided the improper integrals are convergent. For example, suppose a func-
tion f has a discontinuity or vertical asymptote at x = c. If both improper integrals ac f (x) dx

6.1 Integration by Parts

In physics and engineering the Gamma function1  (t), defined by

                                                                       

                                        (t) = xt-1 e-x dx for all t > 0,

                                                                     0

has found many uses. Evaluating  (2) entails integrating the function f (x) = x e-x. No formula
or substitution you have learned so far would be of help. Differentiating that function, on the
other hand, is easy. By the Product Rule for differentials,

d(x e-x) = x d(e-x) + d(x) e-x         so integrate both sides to get
            = -x e-x dx + e-x dx

d(x e-x) = -x e-x dx - d(e-x)
x e-x dx = -d(x e-x) - d(e-x),

                        x e-x dx = - d(x e-x) - d(e-x) = -x e-x - e-x + C

since dF = F + C. Generalizing this process for functions u and v,
                                                  d(uv) = u dv + v du
                                                    u dv = d(uv) - v du

so that integrating both sides yields the integration by parts formula:

For differentiable functions u and v:

                                       u dv = uv - v du                    (6.1)

Greek capital letter  for this function is due to the French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833).

                                                                           159
160 Chapter 6 · Methods of Integration                                                §6.1

Integration by parts is just the Product Rule for derivatives in integral form, typically used
when the integral v du would be simpler than the original integral u dv.

Example 6.1

Use integration by parts to evaluate x e-x dx . Use the answer to evaluate  (2).

Solution: The original integral is always of the form u dv, so you must decide which parts of xe-x dx
will represent u and dv. Typically you would choose dv to be a differential that you could integrate
easily (since you will need to integrate dv to get v) and choose u to be a function whose derivative is
simpler than u (since that derivative will appear in v du, which you hope to be a simpler integral). In
this case, pick u = x and dv = e-x dx. Then du = dx and v = dv = e-x dx = -e-x (you can omit the
generic constant C for now--include it when you have evaluated v du). Thus,

                                                       u dv = uv - v du

             x e-x dx = x (-e-x) -                                 -e-x dx

             u dv                            uv                       v du

             x e-x dx = -x e-x - e-x + C

which agrees with the example at the beginning of this section. Note that v du = -e-x dx, which
indeed is simpler than the original integral. The Gamma function value  (2) can now be evaluated:

                               

              (2) = x e-x dx

                             0
                                                     

                    = -x e-x - e-x

                                                     0

             = lim (-x e-x - e-x) - (-0 e0 - e0)

                 x

             = - lim xx - lim e-x - (0 - 1)
             x e                                      x

             =0-0+1=1

Example 6.2

What would happen in Example 6.1 if you let u = e-x and dv = x dx?

Solution: In this case du = -e-x dx and v =  dv =  x  dx  =  1  x2,  so  that
                                                             2

             x e-x dx = e-x x dx

                                             u dv

                   = e-x 12 x2 -                             12 x2 (-e-x) dx

                         uv                                     v        du

                                                          = 12 x2 e-x + 12 x2 e-x dx
which leads you in the wrong direction: a more difficult integral than the original.
                                                                    Integration by Parts · Section 6.1 161

   Example 6.2 showed the importance of an appropriate choice for u and dv. There are some
rough guidelines for that choice--as in Example 6.1--but no rules that are guaranteed to
always work. It might not be clear when you should even attempt integration by parts.

Example 6.3

Evaluate ln x dx .

Solution: Integration by parts ostensibly requires two functions in the integral, whereas here ln x ap-

pears to be the only one. However, the choice for dv is a differential, and one exists here: dx. Choosing
                                                             1
dv  =  dx  obliges  you  to  let  u  =  ln  x.  Then  du  =  x  dx  and  v  =   dv =  dx = x. Now integrate by parts:

                                                      u dv = uv - v du

                                                ln x dx = (ln x) (x) -             1
                                                                                x · x dx

                                                             = x ln x - 1 dx

                                                             = x ln x - x + C

Note that choosing dv = ln x dx would be pointless, as integrating dv to get v is the original problem!

Example 6.4

Evaluate x3 ex2 dx .

Solution: One frequently useful guideline for integration by parts is to eliminate the most complicated

function in the integral by integrating it--as dv--into something simpler (which becomes v). In this
integral, ex2 is somewhat complicated but has no closed form antiderivative. However, x ex2 appears in
the integral and can be integrated easily (using a substitution as in Section 5.4). So choose dv = x ex2 dx,
                                                                            x2  1 x2
which means u = x . Then du = 2x dx and v = dv = x e dx = 2 e . Now integrate by parts:2

                                                u dv = uv - v du

                                                x3 ex2 dx = x2 · 12 ex2 - 12 ex2 · 2x dx

                                                          = x2 ex2 -        x ex2 dx
                                                              2

                                                          = x2 ex2 - 1 ex2 + C
                                                                2        2

                                                          = (x2 - 1) ex2 + C
                                                                  2

Sometimes multiple rounds of integration by parts are needed, as in the following example.
162 Chapter 6 · Methods of Integration                                             §6.1

Example 6.5

Evaluate x2 e-x dx .

Solution: This integral appears similar to the one in Example 6.1, so choose dv = e-x dx and u = x2.
Then du = 2x dx and v = e-x dv = -e-x. Now integrate by parts:

u dv = uv - v du

x2 e-x dx = x2 · (-e-x) - -e-x · 2x dx

= -x2 e-x + 2 x e-x dx (integrate by parts again)

x2 e-x dx = -x2 e-x + 2 (-x e-x - e-x) + C   (by Example 6.1)
             = -x2 e-x - 2x e-x - 2 e-x + C

   In the above example, notice that the u = 2x in the second integral came from the derivative
of the u = x2 in the first integral. Likewise, the dv = -e-x dx in the second integral came from
integrating the dv = e-x dx in the first integral. In general, if n rounds of integration by parts
were needed, with ui and vi representing the u and v, respectively, for round i = 1, 2, . . ., n,
then the repeated integration by parts would look like this:

                      u1 dv1 = u1v1 - v1 du1

                                = u1v1 - u2 dv2

                                = u1v1 - u2v2 - v2 du2 = u1v1 - u2v2 + u3 dv3

= u1v1 - u2v2 + u3v3 - u4 dv4

                                = u1v1 - u2v2 + u3v3 - u4v4 - u5 dv5
                                = ···
                                = u1v1 - u2v2 + u3v3 - u4v4 + u5v5 - · · · un dvn
The last integral un dvn is one you could presumably integrate easily.

   The above procedure is called the tabular method for integration by parts, since it can be
shown in a table (the arrows indicate multiplication):

                            u             dv

                            u4            v4 (-)
                            ..          ..          ..
                              .           .        .

   The idea is to differentiate down the u column and integrate down the dv column. If the u
in the original integral is a polynomial of degree n, then you know from Section 1.6 that its
(n + 1)-st derivative will be 0, at which point the tabular method terminates. The integral is
then the sum of the indicated products with alternating signs.

   For example, the tabular method on the integral from Example 6.5 looks like this:

                                 u            dv

                                 x2           e-x dx

                                 2x          -e-x (+)          + (x2) (-e-x)
                                                               - (2x) (e-x)
                                 2            e-x       (-)
                                                               + (2) (-e-x)
             STOP                0           -e-x (+)

The integral is the sum of the products, and agrees with the result in Example 6.5:
      x2 e-x dx = + (x2) (-e-x) - (2x) (e-x) + (2) (-e-x) + C = -x2 e-x - 2x e-x - 2 e-x + C

Example 6.6

Evaluate x3 e-x dx .

Solution: Use the tabular method with u = x3 and dv = e-x dx:

                                     u         dv

                                 x3            e-x dx
                                               -e-x (+)
                                 3x2           e-x (-)         + (x3) (-e-x)
                                               -e-x (+)        - (3x2) (e-x)
                                 6x            e-x (-)         + (6x) (-e-x)

                                     6                         - (6) (e-x)

                      STOP           0

                      x3 e-x dx = -x3 e-x - 3x2 e-x - 6x e-x - 6 e-x + C

   Integration by parts can sometimes result in the original integral reappearing, allowing it
to be combined with the original integral.

Example 6.7                                                                      dv =  sec2 x dx = tan x.

Evaluate sec3 x dx .

Solution: Let u = sec x and dv = sec2 x dx, so that du = sec x tan x dx and v =
Then

             u dv = uv - v du

             sec3 x dx = sec x tan x - sec x tan2 x dx

             sec3 x dx = sec x tan x - sec x (sec2 x - 1) dx

             sec3 x dx = sec x tan x + sec x dx - sec3 x dx

             2 sec3 x dx = sec x tan x + ln | sec x + tan x | + C

             sec3 x dx = 1 (sec x tan x + ln | sec x + tan x |) + C
                              2

Example 6.8

Evaluate ex sin x dx .                                              dv =  sin x dx = - cos x. Then
Solution: Let u = ex and dv = sin x dx, so that du = ex dx and v =

             u dv = uv - v du

                                              ex sin x dx = -ex cos x + ex cos x dx

and so integration by parts is needed again, for the integral on the right: let u = ex and dv = cos x dx, so
that du = ex dx and v = dv = cos x dx = sin x. Then

                                      ex sin x dx = -ex cos x + uv - v du

             ex sin x dx = -ex cos x + ex sin x - ex sin x dx

             2 ex sin x dx = -ex cos x + ex sin x
                  ex sin x dx = ex2 (sin x - cos x) + C

Solution: Since x3 1 - x2 = x2 · x 1 - x2, and x 1 - x2 is easy to integrate (via a substitution), let
u = x2 and dv = x  1 - x2 dx. Then du = 2x dx and v =                  x2            1         x2)3/2,

31. Some physics texts write integrals in a form like this energy integral from statistical mechanics,

                            0

which uses the differential of a function--in this case d(x3)--instead of a variable (e.g. not just plain
dx). This often signals that integration by parts is on the way, with the added benefit of having the
v = dv calculation done for you--in the above integral d(x3) means that v = x3, with dv = d(x3) not
really being needed for anything else. With that understanding, show that for 0 <  < 1,

6.2 Trigonometric Integrals

In engineering applications you sometimes encounter integrals of the form

                                                cos (t + 1) cos (t + 2) dt

where t + 1 and t + 2 are different angles (e.g. when the voltage and current are out of
phase in an AC circuit). In general, integrals involving products of sines and cosines with
"mixed" angles can be simplified with the useful product-to-sum formulas:2

              sin A cos B =                    1     (sin (A + B)     +  sin (A - B))    (6.2)

                                                                                         (6.4)
              cos A sin B =                    1     (sin (A + B)     -  sin (A - B))    (6.5)

              cos A cos B =                    1     (cos (A + B)     +  cos (A - B))
                                               2

              sin       A           sin  B  =  -1    (cos (A + B)     -  cos (A - B))

                                                  2

Example 6.10

Evaluate 0.5 sin x sin 12x dx .

Solution: Using the product-to-sum formula (6.5) with A = x and B = 12x,

              sin                A  sin  B  =     1  (cos (A + B)  -  cos (A - B))

                                               -2

              sin x              sin 12x    =     1  (cos (x + 12x)  -   cos (x - 12x))

                                               -2

              sin x              sin 12x    =     1  (cos 13x  -   cos 11x)

                                               -2

since cos(-11x) = cos 11x. Then

              0.5 sin x sin 12x dx = - 14 (cos 13x - cos 11x) dx

                                               = - 152 sin 13x + 144 sin 11x + C

Notice how the product-to-sum formula turned an integral of products of sines into integrals of individ-
ual cosines, which are easily integrated. The integrand is an example of a modulated wave, commonly
used in electronic communications (e.g. radio broadcasting). The graph is shown below:

                     y                      y = 0.5 sin x sin 12x                   x
                                                                             2
                0.5
                  0

              -0.5

The curves y = ±0.5 sin x (shown in dashed lines) form an amplitude envelope for the modulated wave.

   On occasion you might need to integrate trigonometric functions raised to powers higher
than two. For the sine function raised to odd powers of the form 2n + 1 (for n  1), the trick is
to replace sin2 x by 1 - cos2 x, so that

                                         sin2n+1 x dx = (sin2 x)n sin x dx

                                                           = (1 - cos2 x)n sin x dx

                                                           = p(u) du
where p(u) is a polynomial in the variable u = cos x, and the remaining single sin x is now part
of du = - sin x dx. You can then use the Power Formula to integrate that polynomial.
Example 6.11
Evaluate sin3 x dx .
Solution: Let u = cos x so that du = - sin x dx:

                                                  sin3 x dx = (sin2 x) sin x dx

                                                               = (1 - cos2 x) sin x dx

                                                               = (u2 - 1) du

In general sin2n+1 x dx will be a polynomial of degree 2n + 1 in terms of cos x. Similarly, use
cos2 x = 1 - sin2 x to integrate odd powers of cos x, with the substitution u = sin x:

                                         cos2n+1 x dx = (cos2 x)n cos x dx

= (1 - sin2 x)n cos x dx

   Integrals of the form sinm x cosn x dx, where either m or n is odd, can be evaluated using
the above trick for the function having the odd power.

Example 6.12
Evaluate sin2 x cos3 x dx .
Solution: Replace cos2 x by 1 - sin2 x, then let u = sin x so that du = cos x dx:

                                         sin2 x cos3 x dx = sin2 x (cos2 x) cos x dx

                                                          = sin2 x (1 - sin2 x) cos x dx

                                                          = (u2 - u4) du

                                                          = 13 u3 - 15 u5 + C
                                                          = 13 sin3 x - 15 sin5 x + C

For even powers of sin x or cos x. You would replace sin2 x or cos2 x with either
                             sin2 x = 1 - cos 2x 2 or cos2 x = 1 + cos 2x 2 ,

respectively, as often as necessary, then proceed as before if odd powers occur.

Example 6.13

Evaluate sin4 x dx .

Solution: Replace sin2 x by 1-cos 2x :

                                                       2

                      sin4 x dx =                         1 - cos 2x 2

   Similar methods can be used for integrals of the form secm x tann x dx when either m is
even or n is odd. For an even power m = 2k + 2, use sec2 x = 1 + tan2 x for all but two of the m
powers of sec x, then use the substitution u = tan x, so that du = sec2 x dx. This results in an
integral of a polynomial p(u) in terms of u = tan x:

                               sec2k+2 x tann x dx = (sec2 x)k sec2 x tann x dx

= (1 + tan2 x)k tann x sec2 x dx

                                           p(u)  du

Likewise for an odd power n = 2k + 1, use tan2 x = sec2 x - 1 for all but one of the n powers of
tan x, then use the substitution u = sec x, so that du = sec x tan x dx. This results in an integral
of a polynomial p(u) in terms of u = sec x:

secm x tan2k+1 x dx = secm-1 x sec x (tan2 x)k tan x dx

= secm-1 x (sec2 x - 1)k sec x tan xdx

                                        p(u)     du

Mimic the above procedure for integrals of the form cscm x cotn x dx when either m is even
or n is odd, using the identity csc2 x = 1 + cot2 x in a similar manner.

Example 6.14
Evaluate sec4 x tan x dx .
Solution: Use sec2 x = 1 + tan2 x for one sec2 x term, then substitute u = tan x, so that du = sec2 x dx:

sec4 x tan x dx = sec2 x sec2 x tan x dx

= (1 + tan2 x) tan x sec2 x dx

= (1 + u2) u du

= (u + u3) du

   For some trigonometric integrals try putting everything in terms of sines and cosines.

              = cos4 x sin x dx (now let u = cos x, du = - sin x dx)

              = - u4 dx = - 1 cos5 x + C

6.3 Trigonometric Substitutions

One of the fundamental formulas in geometry is for the area A of a circle of radius r: A = r2.
The calculus-based proof of that formula uses a definite integral evaluated by means of a
trigonometric substitution, as will now be demonstrated.

   Use the circle of radius r > 0 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the x y-plane, whose equation is
x2 + y2 = r2 (see Figure 6.3.1(a) below).

                  y     (x, y) = (r cos , r sin )                                               y
x2 + y2 = r2                   rx                                                                        y = r2 - x2

                                    Figure 6.3.1 Circle of radius r

   By symmetry about the x-axis, the area A of the circle is twice the area of its upper hemi-
sphere (see Figure 6.3.1(b) above), which is the area under the curve y = r2 - x2:

                                                       r     r2 - x2 dx

                                       A=2

                                                     -r

To evaluate this integral, recall from trigonometry that any point (x, y) on the circle can be

written as (x, y) = (r cos , r sin ), where 0   < 2 (in radians) is the angle shown in Figure

6.3.1(a). Figure 6.3.1(b) shows that as x goes from x = -r to x = r, the angle  goes from  = 

to  = 0. Now substitute x = r cos  and dx = -r sin  d into the integral and change the limits

of integration from x = -r and x = r to  =  and  = 0, respectively:

                0                                                                     r2 (1 - cos2 ) (-r sin ) d

   For an indefinite integral of the general form a2 - u2 du, the same calculation as above
with the substitutions u = a cos  and du = -a sin  d yields

               a2 - u2 du =                a2 - a2 cos2  (-a sin ) d = -a2 sin2  d

                                    = -a2      1 - cos 2 d = - a  + + C 2 a2 sin 2 ,

which is still in terms of . To put this back in terms of u, use  = cos-1( ua ), the double-angle
formula sin 2 = 2 sin  cos , and a2 - u2 = a2 sin2  = a sin . Then

                           a2 - u2 du = - a2 cos-1 u                2a2 sin  cos

                                                                 + (a cos ) (a sin ) 2 + C
                                          = - a2 cos-1 u
                                               2          a

which results in the following formula:

                           a2 - u2 du = - a2 cos-1 u + 1 u              a2 - u2 + C                    (6.6)

It is left as an exercise to show that the substitution u = a sin  gives:

                           a2 - u2 du = a2 sin-1 u                  1   a2 - u2 + C                    (6.7)

That these two seemingly different antiderivatives are equivalent follows immediately from
               sin-1 x     cos-1 x
the  identity           +           =     for  all  -1    x  1,  which  shows  that  the  antiderivatives  differ
                                       2
               a2
by the constant 4 (absorbed in the generic constant C):

     a2 sin-1 u               1     a2 - u2 + C = a - 2  cos-1 u                  1       a2 - u2 + C
     2         a           + 2u                           22            a      + 2u

                                                       = - a2 cos-1 u + 1 u    a2 - u2 + C + a2
                                                          2      a2                                 4

                                                                                            C

Thus, either substitution--u = a cos  or u = a sin --can be used when evaluating the integral
    a2 - u2 du. The latter choice is sometimes preferred, to avoid the negative sign in du and

the resulting formula.

                       u2 - a2                  u = a sec           sec2  - 1 = tan2 

For example, the substitution u = a tan  leads to the following formula:

              a2 + u2 du = 12 u                a2 + u2 + a2 ln u +                  a2 + u2 + C                  (6.8)
                                                              2

Similarly, the substitution u = a sec  yields this formula:

              u2 - a2 du  =             1      u2 - a2 - a2 ln u +                  u2 - a2 + C                  (6.9)
                                          u                   2
                                        2

The proof of each formula requires this result from Example 6.7 in Section 6.1:                                  (6.10)
                               sec3  d = 12 (sec  tan  + ln | sec  + tan  |) + C

The above substitutions can be used even if no square roots are present.

Example 6.17

Evaluate     dx
          (1 + x2)2 .

Solution: Notice that this integral cannot be evaluated by using the Power Formula with the substi-
tution u = 1 + x2 (why?). Integration by parts does not look promising, either. So try a trigonometric
substitution. The integrand contains a term of the form a2 + u2 (with a = 1 and u = x), so use the
substitution x = tan . Then dx = sec2  d and so

                                          dx               sec2  d
                                       (1 + x2)2 =       (1 + tan2 )2

                                                            sec2  d
                                                     = (sec2 )2

                                                              d
                                                     = sec2 2

                                                     = cos2  d

                                                     = 1 + cos 2 d
                                                                 2

                                                     = 2 + 14 sin 2 + C

                                                     = 2 + 12 sin  cos  + C

by the trigonometric double-angle identity sin 2 = 2 sin  cos .

   The simplest way to get expressions for sin  and cos  in terms of x is to draw                    2
                                                                                                  1 + x x
a  right  triangle  with  an  angle    such  that  tan   =  x  =  x   as  in  the  drawing  on

                                                                  1,
the right. The hypotenuse must then be 1 + x2 (by the Pythagorean Theorem),
                                                                                                
which makes it easy to read off the values of sin  and cos :
                                                                                                  1
                              sin  = x               and cos  = 1
                                             1 + x2                           1 + x2

Since  = tan-1 x, putting the integral back in terms of x yields:

                              (1 + x2)2 dx = 12 tan-1 x + 12       x           1
                                                                  1 + x2      1 + x2 + C

                                       = 12 tan-1 x + 2 (1 + x2 x ) + C

Note: An alternative method for getting sin  and cos  in terms of x would be to put tan  = x in the
identity sec2  = 1 + tan2  to solve for cos , then use the identity sin2  = 1 - cos2  to solve for sin .

By completing the square, quadratic expressions in x can be put in one of the forms a2 ± u2 or
u2 - a2, enabling the use of the corresponding trigonometric substitution.

Example 6.18

Evaluate dx (4x2 + 8x - 5)3/2 .
Solution: This integral cannot be evaluated by using the Power Formula, so try a trigonometric substi-
tution. Complete the square on the expression 4x2 + 8x - 5:

             4x2 + 8x - 5 = 4 (x2 + 2x) - 5 = 4 (x2 + 2x + 1) - 5 - 4 = 4 (x + 1)2 - 9

This expression is now of the form u2 - a2 for u = 2 (x + 1) and a = 3. Use the substitution u = a sec ,
which means 2 (x + 1) = 3 sec . Then 2 dx = 3 sec  tan  d and so:

                      dx                            dx
              (4x2 + 8x - 5)3/2 =         (4 (x + 1)2 - 9)3/2

                                     3 sec  tan  d 3 sec  tan  d
                                  = 2 (9 sec2  - 9)3/2 = 2 (9 (sec2  - 1))3/2

                                      1       sec  tan  d 1              sec  d 1     cos  d
                                  = 18             tan3  = 18             tan2  = 18   sin2 

                                      1       csc  cot  d = - 1 csc  + C
                                  = 18                                 18

To get an expression for csc  in terms of x, draw a right triangle with          2(x + 1)
                                  2(x+1)
an  angle    such  that  sec   =          as  in  the  drawing  on  the  right.               4x2 + 8x - 5
                                    3,                                               3
The side opposite  must then be 4x2 + 8x - 5 (by the Pythagorean

Theorem), and hence:                                    2(x + 1)
                                                       4x2 + 8x - 5
                                              csc  =

Putting the integral back in terms of x yields:

                                          dx           1         2(x + 1) + C
                                  (4x2 + 8x - 5)3/2 = - 18      4x2 + 8x - 5

                                                                  = - x+1 + C
                                                                         9 4x2 + 8x - 5

Note: Trigonometric identities could have been used to obtain csc  by knowing sec .

The following integrals from Section 5.4 might be helpful for the exercises:

                                  tan u du = ln |sec u| + C                                   (6.11)

                                  sec u du = ln |sec u + tan u| + C                           (6.12)

                                   csc u du = - ln |csc u + cot u| + C                        (6.13)

6.4 Partial Fractions

In the last two sections some trigonometric integrals were simplified by using various trigono-
metric identities. For integrals of rational functions--quotients of polynomials--some alge-
braic identities (e.g. x2 - a2 = (x - a)(x + a)) will be useful in the method of partial fractions.
The idea behind this method is simple: replace a complicated rational function with simpler
ones that are easy to integrate.

   For example, there is no formula for evaluating the integral

                                                 dx
                                               x2 + x

but notice that you can write

                                x21+ x = 1 x (x + 1) = 1x - 1 x + 1 ,

called  the  partial  fraction  decomposition  of    1     so  that

                                                   x2+x ,

                                  dx           1       1
                                x2 + x =       x - x + 1 dx

                                       = ln|x| - ln|x + 1| + C .

There is a systematic way to find this decomposition. First, assume that

                                       1           AB
                                x (x + 1) = x + x + 1

for some constants A and B. Get a common denominator on the right side:

                                1 x (x + 1) = A (x + 1) + Bx x (x + 1)
                                0x + 1 x (x + 1) = (A + B) x + A x (x + 1)

Now equate coefficients in the numerators of both sides to solve for A and B:

                      constant term :     A=1

                      coefficient of x : A + B = 0  B = -A = -1

Thus,                     1 = A + B = 1 + -1 = 1 - 1
as before.            x (x + 1) x x + 1 x x + 1 x x + 1
                                                                  Partial Fractions · Section 6.4 179

   The partial fraction method can be discussed in general, and its assumptions proved4, but
only the simplest cases--linear and quadratic factors-- will be considered here. In all cases it
will be assumed that the degree of the polynomial in the numerator of the rational function is
less than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator.

   Start with the most basic case, similar to the example above:

                                                                                                              p(x)

Case 1 - Distinct linear factors: A rational function q(x) such that degree (p(x)) <
degree (q(x)), where q(x) is a product of n > 1 distinct linear factors

                             q(x) = (a1x + b1) (a2x + b2) ··· (an x + bn) ,

can be written as a sum of partial fractions

                             p(x) = A1 + A2 + ··· + An
                             q(x) a1x + b1 a2x + b2                     anx+ bn

for some constants A1, A2, . . . , An. Those constants can be solved for by getting a common
denominator on the right side of the equation and then equating the coefficients of the

numerators of both sides.

                                                           = (A + B) x + (-5A - 2B) (x - 2) (x - 5)

so that

         coefficient of x :     A + B = 0  B = -A

         constant term : -5A - 2B = 1  -5A + 2A = 1  A = - 13 and B = 13

Thus,

                             x2 - 7x + 10 =                3
                                                      x - 2 + x - 5 dx

                                = - 1 ln |x - 2| + 1 ln |x - 5| + C

   If one linear factor in the denominator is repeated more than once, and all other factors are
distinct, then use the following decomposition:

Case 2 - One repeated linear factor + distinct linear factors: A rational function
q(x) p(x) such that degree (p(x)) < degree (q(x)), where q(x) is a product of n > 1 distinct linear
factors and one linear factor repeated m > 1 times

                           q(x) = (ax + b)m (a1x + b1) (a2x + b2) ··· (anx + bn) ,

can be written as a sum of partial fractions
           p(x) q(x) = A1 ax + b + (ax + b)2 A2 + · · · + (ax + b)m Am + B1 a1x + b1 + · · · + Bn anx + bn

for some constants A1, A2, . . . , Am and B1, . . . , Bn. Those constants can be solved for by
the same method as in Case 1.

Example 6.20

Evaluate  3 2 x dx 2 + x - 1 .
           x +x

Solution: Since x3 + x2 = x2 (x + 1), then

              x2 + x - 1 x2 + x - 1 A B                           C
              x3 + x2 = x2 (x + 1) = x + x2 + x + 1

                                                Ax (x + 1) + B (x + 1) + Cx2
                                            = x2 (x + 1)

                                               (A + C) x2 + (A + B) x + B
                                            = x2 (x + 1)

so that

               constant term :                    B = -1  A=1-B =2
               coefficient of x :           A+B=1         C = 1 - A = -1
              coefficient of x2 :           A+C=1 

Thus,

              x2 + x - 1        2 -1 -1
               x3 + x2 dx =     x + x2 + x + 1 dx

                                = 2 ln |x| + 1 - ln |x + 1| + C0  (C0 = generic constant)
                                                 x

   Case 2 can be extended to more than one repeated factor--the partial fraction decomposition
would then have more terms similar to those for the first repeated factor.

Example 6.21

Evaluate      dx
          x2 (x + 1)2 .

Solution: Expanding Case 2 to two repeated factors,

                         1         AB     C             D
              x2 (x + 1)2 = x + x2 + x + 1 + (x + 1)2

                            =      Ax (x + 1)2 + B (x + 1)2 + Cx2 (x + 1) + Dx2

                                             x2 (x + 1)2

                               (A + C) x3 + (2A + B + C + D) x2 + (A + 2B) x + B
                            = x2 (x + 1)

so that

              constant term :                B=1

              coefficient of x :       A + 2B = 0  A = -2B = -2

              coefficient of x3 :      A + C = 0  C = -A = 2

              coefficient of x2 : 2A + B + C + D = 0  D = -2A - B - C = 1

Thus,

              dx            -2 1       2             1
          x2 (x + 1)2 =     x + x2 + x + 1 + (x + 1)2 dx

              = -2 ln |x| - 1x + 2 ln |x + 1| - 1 x + 1 + C0  (C0 = generic constant)

   The partial fraction decompositions for quadratic factors are similar to those for linear fac-
tors, except the numerators in each partial fraction can now contain linear terms. A factor of
the form ax2+bx+ c is considered quadratic only if it cannot be factored into a product of linear
terms (i.e. has no real roots) and a = 0.

                                                                                                                    p(x)

  Case 3 - Distinct quadratic factors: A rational function q(x) such that degree (p(x)) <
  degree (q(x)), and q(x) is a product of n > 1 distinct quadratic factors

                      q(x) = (a1x2 + b1x + c1) (a2x2 + b2x + c2) · · · (anx2 + bn x + cn) ,

  can be written as a sum of partial fractions

                    p(x) q(x) = a1x2A1x + B1 + b1x + c1 + a2x2A2 x + B2 + b2 x + c2 + · · · + anx2Anx + Bn + bnx + cn
  for some constants A1, A2, . . . , An and B1, B2, . . . , Bn. Those constants can be solved for
  by the same method as in Case 1.

Example 6.22

Evaluate          dx
          (x2 + 1) (x2 + 4) .

Solution: Neither x2 + 1 nor x2 + 4 has real roots, so by Case 3,

              1                      Ax+B Cx+D
              (x2 + 1) (x2 + 4) = x2 + 1 + x2 + 4

                                  =  (Ax + B) (x2 + 4) + (Cx + D) (x2 + 1)

                                                    (x2 + 1) (x2 + 4)

                                  =  (A + C) x3 + (B + D) x2 + (4A + C) x + (4B + D)

                                                       (x2 + 1) (x2 + 4)

so that

          coefficient of x3 : A + C = 0  C = -A
          coefficient of x2 : B + D = 0  D = -B
           coefficient of x : 4A + C = 0  4A - A = 0  A = 0

           constant term : 4B + D = 1  4B - B = 1  B = 13 and D = - 13

Thus,

                                       dx           1  -3              1
                               (x2 + 1) (x2 + 4) =  3
                                                    x2 + 1 + x2 + 4 dx

                                     = 13 tan-1 x - 16 tan-1 x2 + C0

by formula (5.4) in Section 5.4.

A repeated quadratic factor is handled in the same way as a repeated linear factor:

Case 4 - One repeated quadratic factor + distinct quadratic factors: A rational

                p(x)

function q(x) such that degree (p(x)) < degree (q(x)), where q(x) is a product of n > 1 distinct
quadratic factors and one quadratic factor repeated m > 1 times

         q(x) = (ax2 + bx + c)m (a1x2 + b1x + c1) (a2x2 + b2x + c2) · · · (anx2 + bn x + cn) ,
can be written as a sum of partial fractions

  p(x) q(x) = ax2 A1 x + B1 + bx + c + · · · + (ax2 + bx + c)m Am x + Bm + a1x2C1 x + D1 + b1 x + c1 + · · · + anx2 Cnx + Dn + bn x + cn
for some constants A1, . . . , Am, B1, . . . , Bm, C1, . . . , Cn, and D1, . . . , Dn. Those constants
can be solved for by the same method as in Case 1.

Example 6.23

Evaluate          dx
          (x2 + 1)2 (x2 + 4) .

Solution: Neither x2 + 1 nor x2 + 4 has real roots, and x2 + 1 is repeated, so by Case 4,

                     1          Ax+B Cx+D Ex+F
          (x2 + 1)2 (x2 + 4) = x2 + 1 + (x2 + 1)2 + x2 + 4

                        =       (Ax + B) (x2 + 1) (x2 + 4) + (Cx + D) (x2 + 4) + (Ex + F) (x2 + 1)2

                                                      (x2 + 1) (x2 + 4)

with the right side of the equation expanded as

(A + E) x5 + (B + F) x4 + (5A + C + 2E) x3 + (5B + D + 2F) x2 + (4A + 4C + E) x + (4B + 4D + F)
                                                       (x2 + 1)2 (x2 + 4)

so that equating coefficients of both sides gives

coefficient of x5 :     A + E = 0  E = -A

coefficient of x4 :     B + F = 0  F = -B

coefficient of x3 : 5A + C + 2E = 0  5A + C - 2A = 0  C = -3A

coefficient of x2 : 5B + D + 2F = 0  5B + D - 2F = 0  D = -3B

coefficient of x : 4A + 4C + E = 0  4A - 12A - A = 0  A = 0  C = 0 and E = 0

constant term : 4B + 4D + F = 1  4B - 12B - B = 1  B = - 1  D = 1 and F = 1
                                                                         9                            3     9

Thus,

                   dx           -91                1  1
          (x2 + 1)2 (x2 + 4) =                     3  9
                                x2 + 1 + (x2 + 1)2 + x2 + 4 dx

                                        = - 19 tan-1 x + 1 1 3 2 tan-1 x + 2 (x2x+ 1) + 118 tan-1 x2  + C0
                                        = 118 tan-1 x + 6 (x2x+ 1) + 118 tan-1 x2 + C0
where the middle integral on the right is from Example 6.17 in Section 6.3.

   When a rational function has a numerator with degree larger than its denominator, dividing
the numerator by the denominator leaves the sum of a polynomial and a new rational function
perhaps satisfying the conditions for Cases 1-4. When the numerator and denominator have
the same degree, a trick like this might be easier.

       x = = - = 2 + 2 (x2 + 3x + 2) - 3x x2 + 3x + 2 3x 1 - 3x
(x + 1) (x + 2)         (x + 1) (x + 2)  (x + 1) (x + 2) (x + 1) (x + 2)    (x + 1) (x + 2)

The last rational function on the right can be integrated using partial fractions.

13. For all numbers a = b show that

                                     dx (x - a) (x - b) = 1 a - b ln x - a x - b + C .

14. Let q(x) = (x - a1) (x - a2), where a1 = a2. Show that
                                                        q = + (x) 1 1 .
                                                        q(x) x - a1 x - a2

15. For q(x) as in Exercise 14, show that
                                              1 q(x) = q 1 (a1) (x - a1) + q 1 (a2) (x - a2) .

16. Extend Exercise 15 to three distinct linear factors: if q(x) = (x - a1) (x - a2) (x - a3) then
                                  1 q(x) = q 1 (a1) (x - a1) + q 1 (a2) (x - a2) + q 1 (a3) (x - a3) .

This result can be extended to any n  2 distinct factors, though you do not need to prove that.

                                                                      x + x4/3

    by finding constants A, B and C such that

                                     1 = 1 = A + B x-2/3 + C .
                                     x + x4/3 x (1 + x1/3) x  1 + x1/3

Notice how in the second partial fraction the highest power of x in the numerator is one less than in
the denominator, similar to a partial fraction for a quadratic factor in a rational function.

6.5 Miscellaneous Integration Methods

The integration methods presented so far are considered "standard," meaning every calculus

student should know them. This section will discuss a few additional methods, some more

common than others. One such method is the Leibniz integral rule for "differentiation under
the integral sign."5 This powerful and useful method is best explained with a simple example.

Recall from Section 5.4 that

                                    ex dx = 1 ex + C                     (6.14)

for any constant  = 0. This antiderivative involves the variable x and the constant . The idea

behind the Leibniz rule is to reverse those roles: view  as the variable and x as a constant.

The antiderivative is then seen as a function of , and so its derivative can be taken with

respect to . The big leap that this method makes is to move the differentiation operation
inside the integral:6

                  d ex dx =         d (ex) dx =       x ex dx
                  d                 d

However, differentiating the right side of formula (6.14) shows that

       d  x       d 1 x                  (x ex) - 1 · ex 1 x 1 x
          e dx =              e + C =                  =  x e - 2 e
       d          d                        2

Thus,

                                 x  1 x    1 x
                              x e dx =  x e - 2 e + C

which can be verified via integration by parts with the tabular method:

 5The renowned physicist Richard Feynman (1918-1988) famously lamented that the technique was no longer
being taught. See p.72 in FEYNMAN, R.P., Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, New York: Bantam Books, 1986.
 6It can be proved that this is valid when the derivative of the integrand is a continuous function of , which will
always be the case in this book. See pp.121-122 in SOKOLNIKOFF, I.S., Advanced Calculus, New York: McGraw-

What was actually done in the above example? A known integral,

                                                    ex dx = 1 ex + C ,
was differentiated with respect to  via the Leibniz rule to produce a new integral,

                                      x            1 x      1 x
                                  x e dx =  x e - 2 e + C ,

with the constant  treated temporarily--only during the differentiation--as a variable. In
general, that is how the Leibniz rule is used. Typically this means if you want to evaluate a
certain integral with the Leibniz rule, then you "work backwards" to figure out which integral
you need to differentiate with respect to some constant (e.g. ) in the integrand.

Example 6.24

Use the Leibniz rule to evaluate         dx
                                      (1 + x2)2 .

Solution: By formula (5.4) in Section 5.4,

                                                       a2 + x2 dx = a1 tan a -1 x + C
for any constant a > 0. So differentiate both sides with respect to a:

              da a2 + x2 d dx = da a d 1 tan a -1 x + C

              d1                                   1  -1 x  1                          1
              2 2 dx = - a2 tan a + a ·                                                   x 2 · - a2x

              da a + x                                               1+ a

                                  2a               1  -1 x           x
              - 2 2 2 dx = - a2 tan a                       - a (a2 + x2)
              (a + x )

                                  (a2 + x2)2 dx = 2a13 tan a -1 x + 2a2 (a2 + x2 x ) + C

That general formula is useful in itself. In particular, for a = 1,

                                      dx    1 -1            2 x + C ,
                                          2 2 = 2 tan x +
                                  (1 + x )                 2 (1 + x )

which agrees with the result from Example 6.17 in Section 6.3.

Notice that there was no generic constant (e.g. a or ) in the statement of the problem. When that
happens, you will need to figure out where the constant should be in order to use the Leibniz rule.

You can also use differentiation under the integral sign to evaluate definite integrals.

Example 6.25

Show that  0   -x2 1

                e dx = 2  .

                                   -x2

Solution: Let I = 0 e dx. The integral is convergent, since by Exercise 11 in Section 4.4, for all x

                              ex2  1 + x2  0  e-x2  1 + x2 1

implies I is convergent by the Comparison Test, since          1          is   convergent  (and  equals  1 )  by

Example 5.32 in Section 5.5. For   0, define                   0 1+x2 dx                                 2

                                              () =        e-2 x2 dx .
                                                       0 1 + x2

Then clearly (0) = 0, and differentiating under the integral sign shows

                   -22 e-2 x2 + e-2 x2                 dx   (0) =               dx    2 = 2 .1
                  () =
                        0         1+x  2                                       0 1+x

The substitution y = x, so that dy =  dx, shows () can be written as

                      () =     e- y2          2 dy  0  lim ()  I <  .

                              0 1 + y                          

Also, for  > 0,

     d 1 -2                   d  e-2(1+x2)              -2 (1 + x2) e-2(1+x2)
              e  () =                1 + x2 dx = 0                       1 + x2 dx
     d                       d 0

                           = -2 e-2    e-2 x2 dx       , now substitute u = x and du = dx to get

                                     0

                           = -2 e-2 1          e du = -  -u2 2 e-2 I      , and so integrating both sides yields
                                            
                                              0

 d   1 e-2 ()           d = -2I    e  -2 d = -2I2 .
0 d  
                                  0

However, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

                  d     1 e-2 ()  d = 1 e-2  () =              lim 2 ()        - lim 2 ()
                 0 d                                             e                 0  e
                                                       0

                                              = 0 - lim 2 ()       0      , so by L'Hôpital's Rule
                                                         0  e  0

                                              = - lim    ()    2 =-       (0)  1= -2 .

                                                       2                  1+0
                                                0 e + 22 e

Thus,                             -2I2 = - 1   I = 1 2                 2
which is the desired result.
188 Chapter 6 · Methods of Integration                                                                                                     §6.5

   One immediate consequence of Example 6.25 is that

                                                        e-x2 dx = 

                                                                        -

since e-x2 is an even function. The following example shows another consequence, as well as
how useful substitutions can be in writing integrals in a different form.

Example 6.26

Show that the Gamma function  (t) can be written as

                                                      (t) = 2 y2t-1 e-y2 dy                   for all t > 0,

                                                                      0

and that   1  =     .
           2
Solution: Let x = y2, so that dx = 2y dy. Then x = 0  y = 0 and x =   y = , so

               (t) =                            xt-1 e-x dx =             0  ( y2)t-1 e-y2 2  y dy = 2 y2t-1 e-y2 dy .
                                                                                                                  0
                                              0

In this form, with the help of Example 6.25 it is now easy to evaluate                                               1:

                                                                                                                     2

                                          1  1-1 - y2                                      - y2 1

A function closely related to the Gamma function is the Beta function B(x, y), defined by:

                                          B(x, y) =         1 tx-1 (1 - t)y-1 dt              for all x > 0 and y > 0                      (6.15)

                                                           0

It can be shown that7

                                              B(x, y) =  (x)  (y)  (x + y)             for all x > 0 and y > 0.                            (6.16)

Example 6.27

Show that the Beta function B(x, y) can be written as

                                                                B(x, y) = 0 (1 + u)x+y du  ux-1 .

Solution:  Let u =    t                ,  so  that  t=    u  ,  1-  t  =    1  ,  and  dt  =  (1+u du )2 .  Then  t=0    u = 0 and  t=1    u = ,

so
                                                                        u x-1 1 y-1 du                                    ux-1

Another application of substitutions in integrals is in the evaluation of fractional deriva-

tives. Recall from Section 1.6 that the zero-th derivative of a function is just the function

itself, and that derivatives of order n are well-defined for integer values n  1. It turns out
                                                                1
that derivatives of fractional orders (e.g.               n  =        can    be  defined,  with  the  Riemann-Louiville
                                                                2)
definition being the most common:

For all 0 <  < 1, the fractional derivative of order  of a function f (x) is                            (6.17)
                                   dx d f  (x) =  (1 - ) dx 0 (x - t) 1 d dt x f (t) .

Example 6.28

Calculate d1/2 (x) .

                        1/2
           dx
                    1
Solution:  Here  =  2        and  f (x) =  x,  so  that

                             d1/2 (x) = 1 d                   xt                     1d x    t dt
                             dx1/2          (1 - 1/2) dx     0 (x - t)1/2 dt =         dx 0  x-t

since   1  =      by Example 6.26. Use the substitution u = x - t, so that t = x - u2 and dt = -2u du.
        2
Then t = 0  u = x and t = x  u = 0, so

                 d1/2 (x) =            1d          0 (x - u2) (-2u du)       =   2d        x
                 dx1/2                   dx                                        dx
                                                   x         u                             (x - u2) du

                                                                                       0

                                       2d                           u= x  =  2 d 3/2 1 3/2
                                    =                    13                          x - 3x
                                                   xu - 3 u
                                            dx                  u=0              dx

                                    =  2 d 2 3/2             2
                                                   3x =              x
                                            dx               

Part of the motivation for creating fractional derivatives was to find if it were possible to take
two "half" derivatives to form a "whole" derivative:

                                               d1/2      d f 1/2 (x)      = d f (x)
                                               dx1/2     dx1/2                dx

It is left as an exercise to show that the above relation does hold for the function f (x) = x.
Derivatives with fractional order 0 <  < 1 and integer order n  1 can be combined by taking
the derivative of integer order first:8

                                               dxn+ d f n+ (x) = dx d dxn d f n (x)

   Recall from Section 6.3 that the trigonometric substitution x = r cos --or its sister substi-
tution x = r sin --was motivated by trying to find the area of a circle of radius r. To simplify
matters, let r = 1 so that points on the unit circle can be identified with the angle  via that
substitution, with  as shown in Figure 6.5.1(a) below.

   Figure 6.5.1(b) shows a different identification of points on the unit circle--by slope. This
will be the basis for a half-angle substitution for evaluating certain integrals.

   Let A be the point (-1, 0), then for any other point P on the unit circle draw a line from A
through P until it intersects the line x = 1, as shown in Figure 6.5.2 below:

                                   y                                                          y

                        Figure 6.5.2         Half-angle substitution: t = tan     = slope of AP

From geometry you know that the inscribed angle that the line AP makes with the x-axis

is half the measure of the central angle . So the slope of AP is the tangent of that angle:
     1
tan     =  t  =  t,  which  is  measured        along  the  y-axis  and  can  take  any       real  value.    Each     point  on
     2     1
the unit circle--except A--can be identified with that slope t.

   Figure 6.5.2 shows only positive slopes--reflect the picture about the x-axis for negative
slopes. The figure shows that

                             sin 2  =1             t           and cos 2  =        1              1

so that by the double-angle identities for sine and cosine,

                        sin             2 sin  1  cos      1        2       t             1          2t
                                  =                            =           1 + t2       1 + t2 = 1 + t2

and                                                                        1              2 t = 2 2 1 - t2 .
                                                                              2-
                        cos       =     cos2 1     -  sin2 1        =  1+t 1+t 1+t

                                                2             2

Since  = 2 tan-1 t, then                  d = d 2 tan-1 t = 1 + t2 2 dt .

Below is a summary of the substitution:

Half-angle    substitution:             The  substitution           t  =  tan  1   yields:

                                                                               2

                        sin  = 1 + t2 2t                   cos  = 1 + t2 1 - t2                       2 dt
                                                                                             d = 1 + t2

The half-angle substitution thus turns rational functions of sin  and cos  into rational func-
tions of t, which can be integrated using partial fractions or another method.

Example 6.29

Evaluate d 1 + sin  + cos  .

Solution:  Using  t  =  tan  1 ,  the   denominator        of  the  integrand      is

                             2

                             1 + sin  + cos  = 1 + t2 1 + t + 1 + t2 + 1 + t2 = 1 + t2 2 2t 1 - t2 2t + 2

so that

                                        d 1 + sin  + cos  =                2 dt               dt

6.6 Numerical Integration Methods

Section 5.2 showed how to obtain exact values for definite integrals of some simple functions
(low-degree polynomials) by using areas of rectangles. For functions with no closed-form an-
tiderivative, the rectangle method typically produces an approximate value of the definite
integral--the more rectangles, the better the approximation.

For example, suppose you wanted to evaluate                             y
                                                                                         y = sin (x2)
                                            
                                                                      1
                                  sin (x2) dx

                                       0

with the rectangle method. This means finding the area of

the shaded region in the figure on the right. Computers                                                         x
have eliminated the need to do these sorts of calculations 0                                           

by hand. Though the rectangle method is simple to implement in a traditional programming

language (e.g. via a looping construct), there are easier ways in a domain-specific language
(DSL) geared toward scientific computing. One such DSL is MATLAB®, or its free open-source
clone Octave.10

   Implementing the rectangle method from scratch in Octave is a one-liner. For example, sup-
pose you divide the interval [0, ] into 100,000 (105) subintervals of equal length, producing

100,001 (1 + 1e5 in scientific notation) equally spaced points in [0, ] (including 0 and  ).
First use the left endpoints of the 105 subintervals:

octave> sum(sin(linspace(0,sqrt(pi),1+1e5)(1:end-1).^2)*sqrt(pi)/1e5)
ans = 0.8948314693913354

Now use the right endpoints:

  octave> sum(sin(linspace(0,sqrt(pi),1+1e5)(2:end).^2)*sqrt(pi)/1e5)
  ans = 0.8948314693913354

Finally, use the midpoints of the subintervals:

  octave> sum(sin((linspace(0,sqrt(pi),1+1e5)(1:end-1)+sqrt(pi)/2e5).^2)*
                sqrt(pi)/1e5)

  ans = 0.8948314695305527

   The true value of the integral up to 15 decimal places is 0.894831469484145, so all three
approximations are accurate to 9 decimal places.

   The syntax in the above commands can be explained with some examples. The following
command creates 4 equally spaced points in the interval [1, 7] (including x = 1 and x = 7), thus
dividing [1, 7] into 3 subintervals each of length (7 - 1)/3 = 2:

  octave> linspace(1,7,4)
  ans =

1357

Get all but the last number in the above list:11

  octave> linspace(1,7,4)(1:end-1)
  ans =

135

Now square each number in that list of numbers (the dot before the exponentiation operator ^
applies the squaring operation ^2 element-wise in the list):

  octave> linspace(1,7,4)(1:end-1).^2
  ans =

1 9 25

Now take the sine of each of those squared numbers (measured in radians):

  octave> sin(linspace(1,7,4)(1:end-1).^2)
  ans =

0.8414709848078965 0.4121184852417566 -0.132351750097773

Now multiply each of those numbers (the heights of the rectangles) by the width (2) of each
rectangle, then add up those areas:

  octave> sum(sin(linspace(1,7,4)(1:end-1).^2)*2)
  ans = 2.24247543990376

11MATLAB would require you to use two steps:

 MATLAB>> x = linspace(1,7,4);
 MATLAB>> x(1:end-1)

   Before the advent of modern computing, the rectangle method was considered inefficient,
and so alternative methods were created. Two such methods are the trapezoid rule and
Simpson's rule. The idea behind both methods is to take advantage of a nonlinear function's
changing slope by using nonrectangular regions. For the trapezoid rule those regions are trape-
zoids, while Simpson's rule uses quasi-rectangular regions whose top edges are parabolas, as
shown in Figure 6.6.1:

y                                y                                y
                   y = f (x)                        y = f (x)                        y = f (x)

   For a partition P = {a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn-1 < xn = b} of an interval [a, b] into n  1 subinter-
vals of equal width h = (b - a)/n, let yi = f (xi) for i = 0, 1, . . ., n. The trapezoid rule adds up the

areas of trapezoids on each subinterval [xi, xi+1], with the top edge being the line segment join-
ing the points (xi, yi) and (xi+1, yi+1). The approximation formula is straightforward to derive,
based on areas of trapezoids:

Trapezoid rule:
                           f b (x) dx  h (y a 2 0 + 2 y1 + 2 y2 + · · · + 2 yn-1 + yn)

   Simpson's rule depends on pairs of neighboring subintervals: [x0, x1] and [x1, x2], [x2, x3] and
[x3, x4], . . . , [xn-2, xn-1] and [xn-1, xn]. Thus, n  2 must be even. The top edge of the region over
each pair [xi, xi+1] and [xi+1, xi+2] is the unique parabola joining the 3 points (xi, yi), (xi+1, yi+1),
and (xi+2, yi+2). The approximation formula is then:12

  Simpson's rule:

            f b (x) dx  h (y a 3 0 + 4 y1 + 2 y2 + 4 y3 + 2 y4 + · · · + + 2 yn-2 + 4 yn-1 + yn)

Example 6.32

Approximate the value of      
subintervals.
                               sin (x2) dx by using the trapezoid rule and Simpson's rule with n = 105

                          0

Solution: Since x0 = 0 and xn = , then y0 = sin (x02) = sin 0 = 0 and yn = sin (x2n) = sin  = 0. Thus, y0
and yn contribute nothing to the summation formulas for both rules. In particular the trapezoid rule
approximation becomes

              0   sin (x2) dx  h (0 + 2y1 + 2y2 + · · · + 2yn-1 + 0) = h · yk n-12
                                         k=1

which is simple to implement in Octave:

octave> x = linspace(0,sqrt(pi),1+1e5);
octave> h = sqrt(pi)/1e5;
octave> h*sum(sin(x(2:end-1).^2))
ans = 0.8948314693913405

Likewise, the Simpson's rule approximation becomes

                        0 sin (x2) dx  h3 (4y1 + 2y2 + 4y3 + 2y4 + · · · + + 2yn-2 + 4yn-1)
which can be implemented easily by using Octave's powerful indexing features:

  octave> (h/3)*(4*sum(sin(x(2:2:end-1).^2)) + 2*sum(sin(x(3:2:end-1).^2)))
  ans = 0.8948314694841457

In the above command, the statement x(3:2:end-1) allows you to skip every other element in the list
x after position 3, by moving up the list in increments of 2 positions all the way to the next-to-last
position in the list (end-1). Similarly for x(2:2:end-1), which starts at position 2 and then moves up in
increments of 2.
Note that Simpson's rule gives essentially the true value in this case, and the value from the trapezoid
rule is virtually the same as the value produced by the built-in trapz function in Octave/MATLAB:

  octave> trapz(x,sin(x.^2))

  ans = 0.8948314693913402

In general you are better off using these sorts of built-in functions instead of implementing your own.

   Typically Simpson's rule is slightly more efficient than the trapezoid rule, which is slightly
more efficient than the rectangle method. However, in the above examples all the approxima-
tions were accurate to at least 9 decimal places (equivalent to getting the distance between
Detroit and Chicago correct within the thickness of a toothpick). The running time of each
calculation was only a few thousandths of a second. Modern computing has generally made
the efficiency differences negligible.

Notice that the approximations in the rectangle method, the trapezoid rule and Simpson's

rule can all be written as linear combinations of function values f (ai) multiplied by "weights"

wi:                                              b                    n

For  example,  the  weights  in  Simpson's           rule      are    wi   =  h    2h  or   4h  depending  on     the  points  ai

interval [a, b] into an integral over the specific interval [-1, 1] and then uses a standard set of
points in [-1, 1] and known weights for those points:13

Example 6.33

Approximate the value of 0 1 + x3 2 dx by using Gaussian quadrature with n = 4 points.
Solution: For a = 0 and b = 2, use the substitution u = b-1a (2x-a-b) = x-1, so that x = u+1 and dx = du.
Thus, g(u) = f (u + 1) = 1+(u+ 1 1)3 . Using n = 4 in Table 6.1, the points ai and weights wi are

                               a1 = -0.339981  w1 = 0.652145

                               a4 = 0.861136   w4 = 0.347855

         1.091621

The true value of the integral to six decimal places is 1.090002.
Using more points (e.g. n = 7) is easy to implement in Octave, using element-wise operations on arrays:

octave> a = [ 0 -0.405845 0.405845 -0.741531 0.741531 -0.949108 0.949108 ];

octave> sum(w./(1 + (a+1).^3))
ans = 1.090016688064804

Gaussian quadrature can be applied to improper integrals. For example,

                                               n

     Analytic Geometry and Plane Curves

7.1 Ellipses

If you were to ask a random person "What is a circle?" a typical response would be to kick the
can down the road: "Something that's round." There is a simple definition:

  A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are a fixed distance from a fixed point in that
  plane. The fixed point is the center of the circle, while the fixed distance from the center
  is the circle's radius.

Similarly, the question "What is an ellipse?" would likely be answered with "an oval," "some-
thing egg-shaped," or "a squished circle." A precise definition would be:

  An ellipse is the set of all points in a plane such that the sum of the distances from each
  of those points to two fixed points in the plane is the same constant. The two fixed points
  are the foci--plural of focus--of the ellipse.

Figure 7.1.1 illustrates the above definitions, with a point P moving along each curve.

   The circle's definition makes it easy to imagine its shape, especially for anyone who has
drawn a circle with a compass. The definition of the ellipse, on the other hand, might not im-
mediately suggest an "oval" shape. Its shape becomes apparent when physically constructing
an ellipse by hand, using only the definition. Stick two pins in a board and tie the ends of a
piece of string to the pins, with the string long enough so that there is some slack (see Figure
7.1.2(a)). The pins will be the foci of the ellipse.

                                                                 È

(a) Two pins and string on a board          (b) Pull the string taut with a pencil

           Figure 7.1.2 Construction of an ellipse

   Pull the string taut with a pencil whose point is touching the board, then move the pencil
around as far as possible on all sides of the pins. The drawn figure will be an ellipse, as in
Figure 7.1.2(b). The length of the string is the constant sum d1 + d2 of distances from points
on the ellipse to the foci. The symmetry of the ellipse is obvious.

   There is some terminology connected with ellipses. The principal axis is the line containing
the foci, and the center is halfway between the foci, as in Figure 7.1.3:

                                            major axis                   principal

                                              Figure 7.1.3 The parts of an ellipse

   The vertexes are the points where the ellipse intersects the principal axis. The major axis
is the chord joining the vertexes, and the minor axis is the chord through the center that is
perpendicular to the major axis. The two semi-major axes are the halves of the major axis
joining the center to the vertexes (CV1 and CV2 in Figure 7.1.3). Likewise the semi-minor
axes are the two halves of the minor axis. A chord through the center is a diameter. Notice
that a circle is the special case of an ellipse with identical foci (i.e. the foci and center are all
the same point).

   Ellipses appear in nature (e.g. the orbits of planets around the Sun) and in many applica-
tions. The ancient Greeks were able to derive many properties of the ellipse from its purely
geometric definition.1 Nowadays those properties are typically derived using methods from
analytic geometry--the study of geometric objects in the context of coordinate systems.2 You
have already seen the equation of an ellipse in the x y-plane centered at the origin: ax22 + b2 y2 = 1,
where a > b > 0, with the x-axis as the principal axis. The equation is straightforward to derive
from the definition of the ellipse.

In the x y-plane, let the foci of an ellipse be the points                                       y

(±c, 0) for some c > 0, so that the center is the origin (0, 0)                                        (x, y)

and the x-axis is the principal axis, as in the figure on
the right. Denote by 2a the constant sum d1 + d2 of the d1 d2

distances from points (x, y) on the ellipse to the foci, with                                                   x

a > 0. Notice that a > c, since the distance 2c between the                            (- c, 0)        ( c, 0)

foci must be less than d1 + d2 = 2a. Then by the distance

formula,

                                     d1 + d2 = 2a                                   2

          (x + c)2 + y2 + (x - c)2 + y2 = 2a                  (x + c)2 + y2

                                                           2

          4a (x + c)2 + y2 = 4a2 + (x + c)2 - (x - c)2

          4a (x + c)2 + y2 = 4a2 + 4xc

                      (x + c)2 + y2 = a + ac x
          x2 + 2cx + c2 + y2 = a2 + 2cx + c2 a2 x2

 1The word ellipse is in fact due to the Greek astronomer and geometer Apollonius of Perga (ca. 262-190 B.C.),
which seems an improvement over the name "thyreos" that Euclid (ca. 360-300 B.C.) had given the shape.
 2Pioneered by the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650), for whom the Cartesian
coordinate system is named. The proposition "I think, therefore I am" (Cogito, ergo sum) is due to Descartes.

thus (±a, 0), so the major axis goes from (-a, 0) to (a, 0)                               x
and has length 2a (i.e. the semi-major axis has length -a -c 0 c                   a
a). Similarly, setting x = 0 shows the minor axis goes

from (0, -b) to (0, b), (i.e. the semi-minor axis has
length b). Since a > b > 0 and b2 = a2 - c2,
                                                                     -b

then c = a2 - b2. Thus, for any ellipse of the form                  Figure 7.1.4

x2 y2
a2 + b2 = 1 with a > b > 0, the foci will be at (±c, 0),
where c = a2 - b2. The foci can be used to define an important geometric property of the

ellipse:

The eccentricity of an ellipse is the ratio of the distance between the foci to the length of
the major axis. In the case of an ellipse ax22 + b2 y2 = 1 with a > b > 0, the eccentricity e is given
by

                                         c    a2 - b2 .
                                  e= a =        a

   The eccentricity e is a measure of how "oval" an ellipse is, with 0 < e < 1. The boundary case
e = 0 is a circle, while e = 1 is a line segment; an ellipse is somewhere in between--the closer e
gets to 1, the more "squished" the ellipse. See Figure 7.1.5.

Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun is almost circular: the eccentricity is 0.017. Only the

orbits of Venus and Neptune (both at 0.007) have a lower eccentricity among the nine planets

in the solar system, while Pluto's (0.252) has the highest.
It is left as an exercise to show that the ellipse ax22 + b2 y2 = 1 with a > b > 0 can be written in
terms of the eccentricity e:
                                  y2 = (1 - e2) (a2 - x2)
                                                                                       (7.1)

Example 7.1

Find the area inside the ellipse ax22 + by22 = 1.
Solution: By symmetry the area will be four times the area in the first quadrant. Solving for y in the
equation of the ellipse gives

                  y2 = b2 - ba2  y = b 2 x2 1 - xa2 = a a 2 b 2 - x2

for the upper hemisphere. Thus,

           Area = 4 y dx = a 4b a             a2 - x2 dx

A remarkable feature of the ellipse is the reflection property:                                    P

light shone from one focus to any point on the ellipse will reflect to

the other focus. Figure 7.1.6 shows light emanating from the focus

F1 and reflecting off a point P on the ellipse to the other focus F2.      F1                      F2

Fermat's Principle from Example 4.4 in Section 4.1 showed that

the incoming angle 1 (angle of incidence) of light from point A                           Figure 7.1.6
will equal the outgoing angle 2 (angle of reflection) to point B
for light reflecting off a flat reflective surface at point P, as in

Figure 7.1.7(a). Fermat's Principle also applies to curved surfaces--e.g. an ellipse--with the

angles measured relative to the tangent line to the curve at the point of reflection, as in Figure

7.1.7(b).

   Notice that Fermat's Principle is equivalent to saying that the angles 1 and 2 that the
light's path makes with the normal line through the point of reflection are equal, since each

angle would equal 90 - , as in Figure 7.1.8(a):

                        Figure 7.1.8 Fermat's Principle with normal line

Thus, to prove the reflection property, it suffices to prove that the normal line n to the ellipse

at P bisects the angle F1P F2 in Figure 7.1.8(b)--this would make 1 = 2, so that the indi-

cated path from F1 to P to F2 satisfies Fermat's Principle. First, let P = (x0, y0) be a point on
the ellipse ax22 + b2 y2 = 1, with a > b > 0. Assume that P is not a vertex (i.e. y0 = 0), otherwise the
reflection property holds trivially. By Exercise 15 in Section 3.4, the equation of the tangent

line to the ellipse at P = (x0, y0) is a2 xx0 + b2 yy0 = 1 ,                                                (7.2)

so that its slope is - ab2 y 2x00 . Hence, the negative reciprocal b2x a2 y00 is the slope of the normal line n,
whose equation--valid even when x0 = 0 (i.e. when y0 = ±b)-- is then

                                 b2x0 (y - y0) = a2 y0 (x - x0) .                                           (7.3)

Setting y = 0 and solving for x shows the x-intercept of n is at

                        x = (a2 - b2) x0 y0 c2 2 = 2 x0 = e2 x0
                                 a y0      a

Let N = (e2x0, 0) be that x-intercept, as in Figure 7.1.8(b). The distance F1N from the focus
F1 = (-c, 0) = (-ea, 0) to N is then

                        F1 N = e2 x0 - (-ea) = e (a + ex0)

while the distance F2N from the focus F2 = (c, 0) = (ea, 0) to N is
                                          F2 N = ea - e2 x0 = e (a - ex0) .

Therefore,              F1 N F2 N = e (a + ex0) e (a - ex0) = a + ex0 a - ex0 .

By the distance formula, the distance F1P from F1 = (-ea, 0) to P = (x0, y0) is given by

               (F1 P )2  =  (x0 + ea)2    +   2

                            x0                                                          x0

                                                 e x0

               F1P = a + ex0 .

Similarly, the distance F2P from F2 = (ea, 0) to P = (x0, y0) is given by

               (F2 P )2  =  (x0 - ea)2    +   2    =     2  -   2eax0          +     e2a2       +  (1  -  e  2  )  (  a  2  -    2  )

                                             y0        x0                                                                      x0

               (F2 P )2  =  a2   -  2eax0    +    22   =    (a - ex0)2

               F2P = a - ex0 .

Thus,                                                                                                                                     P

               F1P = a + ex0 = F1 N ,                                                                                                  1 2

and thus sin 2 = sin 1, so that 2 = 1 (since 0 < 1, 2 < 90).

(since 25 > 16), while the ellipse 4 + 9 = 1 has the y-axis as its
principal axis (since 9 > 4).

7.2 Parabolas

As with ellipses, you have seen parabolas (e.g. y = x2) and some of their applications (e.g.
projectile trajectories), but perhaps without knowing their purely geometric definition. The
alternative definition of an ellipse described in Exercise 13 in Section 7.1 is, in fact, similar to
the definition of the parabola:

A parabola is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point (the
focus) and a fixed line (the directrix).

Figure 7.2.1 illustrates the above definition, with a point

P moving along the parabola so that the distance from P to P         F

the focus F equals the distance from P to the directrix D.

Note that the point halfway between the focus and directrix D
must be on the parabola--that point is the vertex, which is       G

the point on the parabola closest to the directrix. The axis   Figure 7.2.1 Parabola: PF = PG
of the parabola is the line that passes through the focus and

is perpendicular to the directrix.  Notice that the ratio  PF  equals 1, whereas that ratio for
                                                           PG
an ellipse--by the alternative definition--was the eccentricity e < 1. The eccentricity of the
parabola, therefore, is always 1.4

To construct a parabola from the definition, cut a piece of string to have the same length AB

as one side of a drafting triangle, as in Figure 7.2.2.

Figure 7.2.2 Construction of a parabola

   Fasten one end of the string to the vertex A of the triangle and the other end to a pin
somewhere between A and B--the pin will be the focus F of the parabola. Hold the string taut
against the edge AB of the triangle at a point P on either side of the pin, then move the edge
BC of the triangle along the directrix D. The drawn figure will be a parabola, as the lengths
P F and PB will be equal (since the length of the string being AB = AP + P F means P F = PB).

 4The eccentricity e of the parabola being 1 means there is no second vertex, unlike the ellipse (where e < 1 forced
the existence of two vertexes in the alternative definition).

To derive the equation of a parabola in the x y-plane,                                                y
                                                                                                        (0, p)
start with the simple case of the focus on the y-axis at
                                                                                                       0

as in the figure on the right. The vertex is then at the                          (x, y)                           x
origin (0, 0). Pick a point (x, y) whose distances d1 and                                                         y = -p

d2 from the focus (0, p) and directrix y = -p, respectively,                             d2

are equal. Then                                                                          (x, - p)

In  other  words,  y  =   1  x2,  which   is  the  more   familiar   form    of   a   parabola.       Thus,  any  curve  of  the

   Switching the roles of x and y yields the parabola 4px = y2, with focus at (p, 0) and directrix
x = -p. For p > 0 this parabola extends rightward, while for p < 0 it extends leftward. See
Figure 7.2.3(b) and (c).

   It is left as an exercise to show that in general a curve of the form y = ax2 + bx + c is a
parabola. Just like not every oval shape is an ellipse, not every "cupped" or "U" shape is a
parabola (e.g. y = x4).

The  slope    of  the  parabola  4py =  x2  is  dy  =    2x  =   x     so  that     the  equation       of  the    tangent  line  to

the parabola at a point (x0, y0) is:                            2p,

                                                y - y0 = x0 2p (x - x0)

                                        2p (y - y0)          =  x0 x   -       2

                                                                             x0

                                      2p y - 2p y0 = x0 x - 4p y0

                                        2p (y + y0) = x0 x                                                                      (7.4)

Likewise, switching the roles of x and y, the tangent line to the parabola 4px = y2 at a point

(x0, y0) is:

                                            2p (x + x0) = y0 y                                                                  (7.5)

Formula (7.5) simplifies the proof of the reflection property                                               y

for parabolas: light shone from the focus to any point on the                                               (x0, y0)        
parabola will reflect in a path parallel to the axis of the parabola.

Figure 7.2.4 shows light emanating from the focus F = (p, 0)
and reflecting off a point P = (x0, y0) on the parabola 4px = y2.                              Q x
If that line of reflection is parallel to the x-axis--the axis of                           (-x0,0) 0 F = (p,0)

the parabola--then the tangent line to the parabola at (x0, y0)                                   Figure 7.2.4 4px = y2
should make the same angle  with the line of reflection as it
does with the x-axis. So extend the tangent line to intersect the

x-axis and use formula (7.5) to find the x-intercept:

                       2p (x + x0) = y0 y = y0 · 0 = 0  x = -x0

Let Q = (-x0, 0), so that the distance FQ equals p + x0. The goal is to show that the angle of
incidence F PQ equals the angle of reflection . The focal radius F P has length

FP =          (p - x0)2 + (0 - y0)2 =       p   2  -  2  p  x0  +  x2  +  4  p  x0  =    p  2  +  2  p  x0  +  x2  =  p + x0 .

                                                                    0                                           0

Thus, FQ = F P in the triangle F PQ, so that F PQ = FQP = , i.e. the light's path does
indeed satisfy Fermat's Principle for curved surfaces.

   The parabola's reflection property shows up in some engineering applications, typically by
revolving part of a parabola around its axis, producing a parabolic surface in three dimen-
sions called a paraboloid. For example, it used to be common for vehicle headlights to use
paraboloids for their inner reflective surface, with a bulb at the focus, so that--by the reflection
property--the light would shine straight ahead in a solid beam. Many flashlights still operate
on that principle. The reflection property also works in the opposite direction, which is why
satellite dishes and radio telescopes are often wide paraboloids with a signal receiver at the
focus, to maximize reception of incoming reflected signals.

in the above figure, imagine if the trajectories for all possible angles were included, filling up a region

that does appear to have a parabolic boundary. This will now be shown to be true.                                                                                v2

    First, it turns out that all the parabolas for 0 <  < 2 have the same directrix y = 2g . To see why,                                                             0

recall from Exercise 11 in Section 4.1 that the maximum height reached by the object is 2g v02 sin2  , which
is thus the y-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola. That vertex is midway between the focus and
the directrix. The parabola is of the form 4py = x2 + bx, where b is a constant that does not affect the
distance between the vertex and directrix5, and 4p is a constant with p < 0 such that the directrix is
-p units above the vertex (since p < 0), just as in the case 4py = x2. The equation of the parabola then

shows that                        1                                                                                                 v2 cos2

                             y = 2g

It is perhaps surprising that all the parabolic trajectories share the same directrix y = 2g v02 , which is
independent of the angle . Note that the heights of each vertex 2g v02 sin2  and focus 2g v02 (sin2  - cos2 )
do depend on . The common directrix is the key to the remainder of the proof.

 5This will be discussed further in Section 7.4.

The origin O = (0,0) is on each trajectory, so by definition of a parabola the foci for all the trajectories
must be a distance 2g v02 from O, i.e. the distance from O to D. That is, the foci of all the trajectories must
lie on the circle C0 of radius 2g v02 centered at O. If P is any other point inside the envelope, so that it lies
on at least one trajectory, then it must be a distance r > 0 below the line D. By definition of a parabola,
P must be the same distance from the foci of any trajectories it belongs to. That is, the foci must be on
a circle C of radius r centered at P and touching the directrix D, as in Figure 7.2.6:

                  Figure 7.2.6 Circles C and C0 intersect at foci of trajectories

In Figure 7.2.6(a) C and C0 intersect at two points F1 and F2, so P               y             v2        L
belongs to two trajectories; P must then be inside the envelope. In
Figure 7.2.6(b) C and C0 do not intersect, so P must be outside the         v2                     0      D
envelope (since it is not on a parabola with a focus on C0). If C and
C0 intersect at only one point F, as in Figure 7.2.6(c), then P must          0                 2g           x
be on the envelope. In that case, P is a distance r + 2g v02 from O, which                            v2 / g
is also the distance from P to the line y = gv02 (denoted by L). Thus, by    g                 r
definition of a parabola, P is on a parabola with focus O and directrix                      P          0

   In Example 7.2 all the trajectories were in the x y-plane only. Removing that restriction, so
that trajectories in all vertical planes through the y-axis are possible, would result in a solid
paraboloid consisting of all possible trajectories from the origin.

   Parabolas also appear in suspension bridges: the suspension cables
supporting a horizontal bridge (via vertical suspenders, as in the figure
on the right) have to be parabolas if the weight of the bridge is uniformly
distributed.6

7.3 Hyperbolas

In the previous two sections you have seen curves with eccentricity e = 0 (circles), 0 < e < 1
(ellipses) and e = 1 (parabolas). The remaining case is e > 1: the hyperbola, whose definition
is similar to the second definition of the ellipse.

A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane such that the ratio of the distance from
a fixed point (a focus) to the distance from a fixed line (a directrix) is a constant e > 1,
called the eccentricity of the hyperbola.

It  will  be  shown  in  Section  7.4  that  the  curve  y=  1  is  a  hyperbola,               y
                                                             x                                          y = 1x
which has two branches (see Figure 7.3.1). In general a hyperbola
                                                                                                  0x

asymptotes.

The ratio of distances referred to in the definition of the hyperbola

also appears in the second definition of the ellipse (where the ratio is

smaller than 1) and in the definition of the parabola (where the ratio

equals 1). In all three cases that ratio is the eccentricity. See Figure

7.3.2(a) for the comparisons.

   There is an analogue for Figure 7.3.2(a) in terms of orbits. For example, an object approach-
ing the Sun must meet or exceed the escape velocity to overcome the Sun's gravitational pull
and avoid returning to orbit. Figure 7.3.2(b) shows the three possible trajectories--hyperbola,
parabola and ellipse--in terms of the object's velocity v and the escape velocity vE. Note the
apparent correlation between the eccentricity of the object's path and its speed as a fraction of
the escape velocity (i.e. vvE ).

directrices--when the definition of the hyperbola mentioned only a focus and a directrix--is
simply a consequence of the symmetry about both axes imposed by the equation ax22 - b2 y2 = 1. A
parabola, in comparison, is symmetric about only one axis.

To    see  why   the  lines  y  =   ± ba x  are  asymptotes,  consider  the      upper    half    y  =  b  x2 - a2 of both
                                                                                                        a
branches   of  the  hyperbola.      The     difference  between    the  line        b     and  the   upper  right  branch
                                                                              y  =  a  x

approaches zero as x approaches infinity:

                 lim b x - b          x2 - a2    = b lim x -            x2 - a2 · x +           x2 - a2
                 x a               a                a x                              x+         x2 - a2

                                                 = b lim x2 - (x2 - a2)
                                                    a x x + x2 - a2

                                                 = lim ab = 0
                                                    x x + x2 - a2

Thus  the  line  y=   ab x  is  an  (oblique)    asymptote    for  the  upper    half     y=   b     x2 - a2 of the right
                                                                                               a
branch in the first quadrant of the x y-plane. So by symmetry the lines y = ± ab x are asymptotes
for both branches, i.e. for the entire hyperbola.
Conversely, given a hyperbola in the form ax22 - b2 y2 = 1, let c2 = a2 + b2 to get the foci (±c, 0)
and the directrices x = ± ca2 , while the eccentricity is e = ac .

Example 7.3

For the hyperbola x2 - y2 = 1 find the vertexes, foci, directrices, asymptotes and eccentricity.
Solution: Here a = b = 1, so that c2 = a2 + b2 = 2, i.e. c = 2. The vertexes are thus (±1,0), the
asymptotes are y = ±x, the foci are (± 2,0), the directrices are x = ± 12 , and the eccentricity is e = 2.

Switching the roles of x and y produces the rotated hyper-                                       y          y = ab x
bola a2 y2 - bx22 = 1, shown in Figure 7.3.6. The transverse axis                           c
is the y-axis, the conjugate axis is the x-axis, the vertexes                               a                      y = ca2
are at (0, ±a), and the foci are at (0, ±c), where c2 = a2 + b2.
The directrices are y = ± ca2 , the asymptotes are y = ± ba x,                            -a                                x
and the eccentricity is e = ac .                                                          -c
                                                                                                            y = - ca2
   For example, the hyperbola y2 - x2 = 1 has a = b = 1, so
that c = 2. The vertexes are (0, ±1), the asymptotes are                                                    y      =  -  a  x
y = ±x, the foci are (0, ± 2), the directrices are y = ± 12 ,                                                            b
and the eccentricity is e = 2. The hyperbola y2 - x2 = 1 is
just the hyperbola x2 - y2 = 1 rotated 90.                                             Figure 7.3.6 ay22 - bx22 = 1

There is another way to define a hyperbola, in terms of two foci:

A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane such that the absolute value of the difference
of the distances from two fixed points (the foci) is a positive constant.

   Figure 7.3.7 illustrates the above definition with foci F1 and F2. The difference d1 - d2 of
the distances d1 and d2 can be positive or negative depending on which branch the point (x, y)
is on, which is why the absolute value |d1 - d2| is used.

   It is left as an exercise to show that this second definition yields the same equation of the
hyperbola as from the first definition. The second definition is often used as the primary def-
inition in many textbooks, perhaps because it provides a simple way to construct a hyperbola
by hand. Figure 7.3.8 shows the procedure for foci F1 and F2: at the focus F1 fasten one end of
a ruler of length L, and at the other end A of the ruler fasten one end of a string of length L - d
for some number 0 < d < F1F2. Fasten the other end of the string to the focus F2 and hold the
string taut with a pencil against the ruler at a point P, while rotating the ruler about F1. The
drawn figure will be one branch of a hyperbola, since the difference P F1 - P F2 will always be
the positive constant d:

    PF1 - PF2 = (L - AP) - PF2 = L - (AP + PF2) = L - (L - d) = d

Reverse the roles of F1 and F2 to draw the other branch of the hyperbola.
By Exercise 16 in Section 3.4, the tangent line to the hyperbola ax22 - b2 y2 = 1 at a point (x0, y0)
is xx0 yy0
                             - 2 =1 ,                                          (7.6)

so that its slope is ab2 y 2x00 when y0 = 0. Note that by the above equation, when y0 = 0 (so that
x0 = ±a) the two tangent lines are the vertical lines x = ±a.

   That slope will be used in proving the reflection property for the hyperbola: Light shone

from one focus will reflect off the hyperbola in the opposite direction from the other focus. Figure

7.3.9 shows the light's path from focus F2 as it reflects at the point P along the line through P
and the other focus F1.

Figure 7.3.9 Reflection property            Figure 7.3.10 Hyperbola ax22 - by22 = 1 with foci (±c, 0)

   By Fermat's Principle for curved surfaces, the reflection property is equivalent to saying the

tangent line L to the hyperbola at the point P = (x0, y0) bisects the angle F1P F2, i.e. 1 = 2 as
in Figure 7.3.10. The reflection property holds trivially when y0 = 0 (the light reflects straight
back along the x-axis), so to show that 1 = 2 assume y0 = 0. By symmetry only x0 > 0 need be
considered. For the case x0 = c, let A be the x-intercept of the tangent line L. Then by Figure
7.3.10, since the sum of the angles in the triangle F1P A equals 180,

               1 + 2 + (180 - ) = 180  2 =  - 1  tan 2 = tan ( - 1) .
Thus, since tan  is the slope of the tangent line L (i.e. ab2 y 2x00 ), and tan 1 = x0+c y0 , then by the
subtraction formula for the tangent function

                                     b2 x0  y0       b2 x2 - a2 y2 + b2 x0 c00

    =  2  = c y
       c y0(a+ x0 c)              0

Similarly, since the sum of the angles in the triangle F2P A equals 180,

    2 + 1 +  = 180  1 = 180 - ( + 2)  tan 1 = - tan ( + 2) .
                                                                 Hyperbolas · Section 7.3                                    221

i.e. 1 = 2 (since 0 < 1, 2 < 90).                Note: The case x0 = c is left as an exercise.

   Ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas are sometimes called conic sections, due to being formed
by intersections of planes with a double circular cone of unlimited extent:

       (a) Ellipse                                  (b) Parabola                                         (c) Hyperbola
                                          Figure 7.3.11 Conic sections

   Each double cone in Figure 7.3.11 has two nappes--a cone extending upward and one ex-
tending downward. When a plane intersects only one nappe in a closed noncircular curve, as
in Figure 7.3.11(a), that curve is an ellipse. A plane that is parallel to a line on one nappe, as
in Figure 7.3.11(b), intersects only that nappe in a parabola. The intersection of a plane with
both nappes, as in Figure 7.3.11(c), is a hyperbola.

from the same point have equal lengths, as in Figure 7.3.12. Since the

right triangles QOP1 and QOP2 share the same hypotenuse QO
and have legs OP1 and OP2 of equal length (the radius of the sphere),
the result QP1 = QP2 follows by the Pythagorean Theorem.

C, such that Pc makes an angle  with any                       

base circle of the cone. By symmetry, only                                         Figure 7.3.13
the angles 0 <   90 need be considered.8

Inscribe a sphere in the cone so that it touches Pc at a point F, as in Figure 7.3.13 (Pc is the

tangent plane to the sphere at F). Let P0 be the plane through the circle where the inscribed

sphere touches the cone, and let D be the line of intersection of the planes Pc and P0. It will

be shown that F and D are the focus and directrix, respectively, of the curve C.

   Let P be any point on the curve C, then let Q be the point on the plane P0 that lies on a line

through P and the cone's vertex. Drop a perpendicular line segment from P to the point A in

the plane P0. From A draw a perpendicular line segment to the point G on the line D. Then

as Figure 7.3.13 shows, Q AP and P AG are right triangles, with

                                        sin  = P A and sin  = P A .
                                                     PG                      PQ

However, since P F and PQ are both tangent line segments to the inscribed sphere from the
same point P, the result proved earlier shows that PQ = P F. Thus,

                 PG sin  = P A = PQ sin  = P F sin   P F PG = sin  sin  .

Let e = PF PG .  Then      e  is  the  same   constant   sin   for  any   point    P  on  the  curve  C.     Thus, by
                                                         sin 
definition, e is the eccentricity of the curve C with focus F and directrix D. If 0 <  <  then
                                        sin 
0  <  sin   <    sin   so  that   0  <  sin   <  1,  which  means   that  0  <  e  <  1,  and  hence  C  is  an  ellipse

(by the second definition of an ellipse). Likewise, if  =  then e = 1, so that C is a parabola.

Finally, if  <   90 then e > 1, so that C is a hyperbola (and will intersect both nappes of the

cone). Thus, the ellipse, parabola and hyperbola truly are conic sections.

 7The proof can be extended to oblique double cones. See §364 in SALMON, G.S., A Treatise on Conic Sections,
London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1929.
 8The case where  = 0 results in a circle, which is typically not considered a conic section.

7.4 Translations and Rotations

For convenience the ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas in the previous sections were centered
at the origin and had their foci on one of the coordinate axes. In general the center and foci of
those curves can be moved anywhere by means of coordinate transformations.

   You have probably seen in earlier courses how the graph of       y
a function y = f (x) can be shifted horizontally by an amount
h and vertically by an amount k by replacing x and y by x-h         y P = (x, y)
and y - k, respectively:                                                                       P = (x, y)

                               y - k = f (x - h)                                   x-h

This coordinate transformation is called translation, and              y-k
can be applied to any curve in the x y-plane. The origin O =
(0, 0) is shifted to the point O = (h, k), which serves as the   k O x
origin of the x y-plane,9 as in Figure 7.4.1. Let P = (x, y) be
a point in the x y-plane. Consider P as a point P = (x, y) in    O                                   x
the x y-plane, so that relative to the origin O, the x and y
coordinates of P are:                                               h

                                                                    Figure 7.4.1 Translation

   x = x - h
   y = y - k

Using these translation equations (i.e. the substitutions x  x - h and y  y- k), the graphs of
the conic sections can be translated to any center (h, k):

Ellipse: For a > b > 0, an equation of the form

a2 (x - h) + 2 = 2 (y - k)2 1                    b

describes an ellipse with center (h, k), vertexes (h±a, k), and foci (h±c, k), where c2 = a2-b2.
The eccentricity is e = ac , and the principal axis is the line y = k.
Likewise, an equation of the form

2 (y - k) + 2 = 2 (x - h)2 1                     b
a

describes an ellipse with center (h, k), vertexes (h, k±a), and foci (h, k±c), where c2 = a2-b2.
The eccentricity is e = ca , and the principal axis is the line x = h.

9The prime symbol () does not indicate differentiation--it acts merely to distinguish the new axes.

                                                      a

describes a hyperbola with center (h, k), vertexes (h ± a, k), and foci (h ± c, k), where c2 =
a2 + b2.                                                                                            a2
          The  eccentricity        is     e  =  ac ,  the  directrices  are  the  lines   x  =  h±  c   ,  the  asymptotes  are

Find the vertexes and foci of the ellipse 4 + (y - 1) = 1.                               y                 x=2

Solution: The translation coordinates are (h, k) = (2,1). Also,

a = 2 and b = 1. Thus, the vertexes are (h ± a, k) = (2 ± 2,1) =                             (2 - 3,1) (2 + 3,1)            y=1
(0,1) and (4,1). Since c2 = a2 - b2 = 3 then c = 3, so the foci

are (h ± c, k) = (2 ± 3,1), as shown in Figure 7.4.2.

Example 7.5

For a = 0 and constants b and c, find the vertex, focus and directrix of the parabola y = ax2 + bx + c.
Solution: The idea here is to write y = ax2 + bx + c in the form (x - h)2 = 4p(y - k) for some h, k, and p,
by completing the square:

                            ax2 + bx + c = y

                            a x2 + b x = y - c
                                       a

                         a x2 + b x + b22                     b2
                                    a 4a   = y - c + a 4a2

                            b2 1                b2 - 4ac
                            x + 2a = a y + 4a

     b       4ac-b2      1  1                                                b 4ac-b2
So h = - 2a , k = 4a , and 4p = a means p = 4a . Thus, the vertex is (h, k) = - 2a , 4a , the focus is

             b 4ac-b2+1                                       4a c-b2 -1
(h, k + p) = - 2a , 4a , and the directrix is the line y = k - p = 4a .

   Rotation is another common coordinate transformation.          y          y

Consider the case of rotating the x y-plane about the origin                           P = (x, y)
                                                                                       P = (x, y)
by an angle , as in Figure 7.4.3. The origin of the result-
ing x y-plane is unchanged from the origin O = (0, 0) of the                    r                 
x y-plane. To find the rotation equations for x and y, let
                                                                                                 x

              x = r cos  and y = r sin  .
                                                                          Figure 7.4.3 Rotation

Considering P as a point P = (x, y) in the x y-plane, OP makes an angle  -  with the
positive x-axis, so that by the sine and cosine subtraction identities,

             x = r cos ( - ) = r cos  cos  + r sin  sin  = x cos  + y sin                        (7.7)

and

             y = r sin( - ) = r sin  cos  - r cos  sin  = y cos  - x sin  .                      (7.8)

Similar to the translation substitutions, the above rotation equations allow any curve in the
x y-plane to be rotated:

To rotate a curve in the x y-plane about the origin by an angle , make the following sub-

stitutions:          x  x cos  + y sin  and y  -x sin  + y cos                         (7.9)

x  x cos  + y sin  = x cos 45 + y sin 45 = x + y                                                   2                 x
                                                                      2
                                                                                          
y  -x sin  + y cos  = -x sin 45 + y cos 45 = -x + y
                                                                            2           y
                                                                                   -2
The equation of the rotated ellipse (shown in Figure 7.4.4) is then:                                       45              x
                                                                                                      0              2

                                                                                            Figure 7.4.4
                              5x2 - 6x y + 5y2 - 8 = 0

   In the above example note the presence of the 6x y term in the equation of the rotated ellipse.
In general if a conic section has a second-degree equation of the form

                              A x2 + Bx y + C y2 + D x + E y + F = 0                                                  (7.10)

then B = 0 indicates rotation, and either D = 0 or E = 0 indicates translation.

Example 7.7
Find the value of a such that rotating the hyperbola ax22 - ay22 = 1 by 45 counterclockwise about the origin
results in the curve x y = 1.
Solution: Since  = 45 then as in Example 7.6 the substitutions are again:

                                           x  x + y and y  -x + y
                                                     2                         2

The equation of the rotated hyperbola is then:

                                           1 x + y 2 1 -x + y 2                   =1
                                                           -2
                                           a2 2                a         2

                                           2a2 x = 2 + 2x y + y2 - (x2 - 2x y + y2) 1

Thus, when a =       2  the  rotated   hyperbola     has  the  equation  x y = 1,  which    shows  that  the  curve  y=  1  is
                                                                                                                         x
a hyperbola. In general any curve of the form Bx y = 1 is a hyperbola for B = 0.

   The following result can be used for determining the type of conic section described by a
second-degree equation:10

The graph of A x2 + Bx y+ C y2 + D x + E y+ F = 0 (with A, B, C not all zero) describes a curve
whose type is based on the sign of B2 - 4AC:
(a) B2 - 4AC < 0: an ellipse (or a circle, point, or no curve)

(b) B2 - 4AC = 0: a parabola (or a line, two parallel lines, or no curve)

(c) B2 - 4AC > 0: a hyperbola (or two intersecting lines)

If B = 0 and the curve is a conic section, then the rotation angle  is given by:
(a)  = 45 if A = C

(b)    tan 2 =     B    if  A = C, with 0 <  < 90
                 A-C

   Recall that the rotation equations (7.7) and (7.8) for x and y in terms of x and y provided
substitutions that allowed the second-degree equation of the rotated conic section to be found.
Conversely, to transform a second-degree equation in x and y into a "standard" conic section
equation in terms of x and y (to simplify sketching the graph), the "reverse" rotation equations
for x and y in terms of x and y are needed:

                                          x = x cos  - y sin                                              (7.11)
                                          y = x sin  + y cos                                              (7.12)

Example 7.8

Determine the type of curve whose equation is 5x2 + 4x y + 8y2 - 36 = 0, and sketch its graph.

Solution: Since A = 5, B = 4, and C = 8, then B2 - 4AC = -144 < 0, so the curve is an ellipse if it is a
                                                                                                           4
conic  section.  Since  B=0  and  A = C,  the  rotation  angle    would  be   given  by  tan 2 =    B  =        with
                                                                                                  A-C     -3 ,
0 <  < 90.       Then 2  is in  the second quadrant,  so that sin 2 =    4    and cos 2 =  -3  Use a half-angle
                                                                         5

                                               1 + cos 2 1 + 5

Hence, sin  = 25 and cos  = 15 . Now use equations (7.11) and (7.12) to get expressions for x and y in
terms of x and y:

                                  x = x cos  - y sin  = x - 2y
                                                                           5

                                  y = x sin  + y cos  = 2x + y
                                                                           5

7.5 Hyperbolic Functions

In some textbooks you might see the sine and cosine functions called circular functions, since
any point on the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 can be defined in terms of those functions (see Figure
7.5.1). Those definitions motivate a similar idea for the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = 1, whose
points can be defined in terms of hyperbolic functions.

                         y                                                  y

is          minus  the  area  under  the  hyperbola    over  the  interval  [1, x].  So  since  the  upper     half  of
    2
the hyperbola x2 - y2 = 1 is the function y = x2 - 1,

                   a2 = (area of triangle) - (area under the hyperbola from 1 to x)

                   a = ln x + x2 - 1

where cosh a is the hyperbolic cosine of a.

11The reason for using twice the area is merely to obtain a "cleaner" final result involving a instead of 2a.

The y-coordinate of P can then be found:

                 y = x2 - 1 =     ea + e-a 2 - 1 =       e2a + 2 + e-2a 4

                        e2a - 2 + e-2a     ea - e-a 2, so since a  0
                 = 4=                          2

                 y = e 2 = a - e-a sinh a

where sinh a is the hyperbolic sine of a. All six hyperbolic functions can now be defined in
general, analogous to the trigonometric (circular) functions:

The hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, hyperbolic tangent, hyperbolic cotan-
gent, hyperbolic secant and hyperbolic cosecant, denoted by sinh, cosh, tanh, coth,
sech and csch, respectively, are:

sinh x = ex - e-x      for all x           cosh x = ex + e-x          for all x
                  2                                          2

tanh x = sinh x cosh x for all x           coth x = 1 tanh x for all x = 0

sech x = 1             for all x           csch x = 1 for all x = 0
             cosh x                                     sinh x

The graphs of the hyperbolic functions are shown below:

The hyperbolic functions satisfy the following identities:

cosh2 x - sinh2 x = 1   tanh2 x + sech2 x = 1                 coth2 x - csch2 x = 1
   sinh(-x) = - sinh x  cosh (-x) = cosh x                  tanh(-x) = - tanh x
   sech (-x) = sech x   csch (-x) = - csch x                coth(-x) = - coth x

sinh(u ± v) = sinh u cosh v ± cosh u sinh v    sinh 2x = 2 sinh x cosh x
cosh(u ± v) = cosh u cosh v ± sinh u sinh v    cosh 2x = cosh2 x + sinh2 x
tanh(u ± v) = tanh u ± tanh v                  tanh 2x = 1 + tanh2 2 tanh x x

                    1 ± tanh u tanh v

The identity cosh2 x-sinh2 x = 1 was proved when deriving the coordinates of points on the unit
hyperbola x2 - y2 = 1 in terms of the hyperbolic angle (since such a point (x, y) = (cosh a, sinh a)
must satisfy x2 - y2 = 1). The addition identities can be proved similarly using hyperbolic
angles (i.e. areas).12 However, it is simpler to use the definitions of sinh and cosh in terms of
exponential functions. For example:

     sinh u cosh v + cosh u sinh v = e 2 · 2 + 2 · u - e-u ev + e-v eu + e-u ev - e-v 2
                                                 eu+v + eu-v - e-u+v - e-u-v + eu+v - eu-v + e-u+v - e-u-v

                                             =4
                                                 2eu+v - 2e-u-v

                                             =4
                                                 eu+v - e-(u+v)

                                             =2
                                             = sinh(u + v)

The identity for sinh 2x is then easy to prove by letting u = v = x in the above identity:

             sinh 2x = sinh(x + x) = sinh x cosh x + cosh x sinh x = 2 sinh x cosh x

Note that the identities cosh(-x) = cosh x and sinh(-x) = - sinh x mean that cosh is an even
function and sinh is an odd function. Those two functions thus (sort of) serve as even and odd
versions of the exponential function (which is neither even nor odd). Both cosh x and sinh x
grow exponentially (the e-x term for both functions becomes negligible as x  ), while sinh x
decreases exponentially to - as x  -.

For example, by definition of cosh x:

                     d (cosh x) = d    ex + e-x  = e 2 = x - e-x sinh x

Example 7.10

Evaluate tanh x dx.

Solution: Use the definition of tanh x and the substitutions u = cosh x, du = sinh x dx:

tanh x dx =              sinh x                 du = ln |u| + C = ln (cosh x) + C
                         cosh x dx =            u

For any constant a > 0, both y = cosh at and y = sinh at satisfy the differential equation

which models rectilinear motion of a particle under a repulsive force proportional to the dis-
placement. This is just one of the many reasons why hyperbolic functions appear in so many
physical applications.

Since dx (sinh x) = cosh x = 2 > 0 for all x, then y = sinh x is an increasing function
and thus its inverse function x = sinh-1 y is defined. The remaining inverse hyperbolic

functions can be defined similarly, with the following domains and ranges (switching the

roles of x and y, as usual) plus their graphs:

The inverse hyperbolic functions can be expressed in terms of the natural logarithm:

      sinh-1 x = ln (x + x2 + 1 )                      cosh-1 x = ln (x + x2 - 1 ) for x  1
      tanh-1 x = 12 ln 1 + x 1 - x for |x| < 1         coth-1 x = 12 ln x + 1 x - 1 for |x| > 1

      sech-1 x = ln 1 + 1 - x2             for 0 < x  1 csch-1 x = ln 1 +                x21 + 1  for x = 0
                                x                                                  x

Notice that the above formula for cosh-1 x was actually proved at the beginning of this section.
The formula for sinh-1 x follows from the definition of an inverse function:

                       y = sinh-1 x  x = sinh y = e y - e-y 2
                                             ey - 2x - e-y = 0
                                             e2y - 2xey - 1 = 0
                                             u2 - 2xu - 1 = 0 for u = e y
                                             u = 2x ± 4x = x ± x + 2 - 4(1)(-1) 2 1
                                                                        2

                                             e y = u = x + x2 + 1 since e y > 0

                                             y = ln(x + x2 + 1 )

The remaining formulas can be proved similarly.

Example 7.12

Show that for the hyperbolic angle a of a point P = (x, y) on the y                              x2 - y2 = 1
unit  hyperbola  x2 - y2  = 1,  the  area  a  of  the  hyperbolic  sector
                                           2                                             P
O AP (the shaded region in the figure on the right) is                                     (x, y) = (cosh a,sinh a)

                          a2 = 12 cosh-1 x .

Solution: It was shown earlier that the area of        O AP is             O A = (1,0) x
                             a2 = 12 ln (x + x2 - 1 )
                                                                           a          =  shaded   area  of  OAP
                                                                           2

so by the formula cosh-1 x = ln (x + x2 - 1 ) the result follows.
This makes sense, since x = cosh a and so cosh-1 x = cosh-1(cosh a) = a, by definition of an inverse.

You can use either the general formula for the derivative of an inverse function or the above
formulas to find the derivatives of the inverse hyperbolic functions:

(a) Let c > 0. When c = 1 the mapping  : (x, y)  (cx, y/c) does not move points along the unit
      hyperbola. Find the formula for  on the unit hyperbola as follows: use the rotation equations
      from Section 7.4 to rotate the unit hyperbola 45 to a hyperbola of the form x y = k, apply  to a
      generic point on that hyperbola, then rotate that hyperbola by -45 back to the unit hyperbola.

(b) Use part (a) to find the value of c such that  maps A = (1,0) to P = (cosh a,sinh a).

(c) Let P be the point that  maps P to, and let A = P. Use part (b) to find the coordinates of P,
      then show that the hyperbolic sectors O AP and O AP have the same area a/2.

7.6 Parametric Equations

Recall that Section 6.5 presented two different ways to "identify" or represent points on the
unit circle--by angle and by slope, as in Figure 7.6.1:

                     y                                                        y
                             (x, y) = (cos ,sin )                                     slope = t
                                                                                         (x, y)

     (a) Identify points by angle                                (b) Identify points by slope t

                            Figure 7.6.1 Points on the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1

When identifying by the angle , all points (x, y) on the unit circle can be written as

                                      x = cos  and y = sin 

for any angle . When identifying by the slope t of lines through the point (-1, 0), recall from
                                                                      2t                         1-t2

                                                                           and cos  = 1+t2 .
(x, y) on the unit circle except (-1, 0) can be written as

                                             x = 1 + t2 1 - t2 and y = 1 + t2 2t

for any slope t. These two distinct "identifications" are called parametrizations of the unit
circle, with parameter  in the first case and parameter t in the second.

   In general, one way to describe a plane curve C (i.e. a curve in the x y-plane) is to write its
x and y-coordinates as functions of a variable t:

                                      x = x(t) and y = y(t)

These are parametric equations of C, which consists of all points (x, y) such that x = x(t) and
y = y(t) for the parameter t in some interval I. The shorthand for this is:

                                      C : x = x(t), y = y(t), t in I

Notice the flexibility that parametric equations provide, since plane curves can take any shape,
not limited to the graph of a single function y = f (x). In fact, a curve y = f (x) is the special
case where the parametric equations are x = t and y = f (t). In physical settings the parameter
t often denotes time, but it can represent anything and any symbol can be used in its place. A
curve can have many parametrizations.
240 Chapter 7 · Analytic Geometry and Plane Curves                                                §7.6

Example 7.13

Show that for any constants  = 0 and r > 0, and for t measured in radians,

                             x = h + r cos t and y = k + r sin t for - < t < 

is a parametrization of the circle (x - h)2 + (y - k)2 = r2 with center (h, k) and radius r.
Solution: Since t is similar to the angle  in Figure 7.6.1(a), it suffices to show that (x-h)2+(y-k)2 = r2:

                                   (x - h)2 + (y - k)2 = r2 cos2 t + r2 sin2 t = r2

The constant  determines how fast and in which direction the circle is traced as the parameter t varies.
For example, for  = 2 the circle C is traced counterclockwise at twice the speed of the parametrization
C : x = h + r cos t, y = k + r sin t. In all cases the circle is re-traced every 2/ radians. For that reason
the interval for t is often restricted to the interval [0,2/], so that the circle is traced only once.

Example 7.14                                                                      y
Show that for a > 0 and b > 0 the parametric equations                          b (x, y) = (a cos t, b sin t)

for 0  t  2 describe an ellipse. -a                                                           x
Solution: Since                                                                           a

                 x2 y2 a2 cos2 t b2 sin2 t 2 + 2 = 2 + 2 = cos2 t + sin2 t = 1  -b

                 ab  a  b

for all t, then the points (x, y) = (a cos t, b sin t) lie on the ellipse ax22 + by22 = 1. It should be obvious that
the entire ellipse is traced, but it is left as an exercise to show what the parameter t represents.

Example 7.15                                            y
Show that the parametric equations                                       (x, y) = (cosh t,sinh t)

                       x = cosh t and y = sinh t

for - < t <  describe one branch of a hyperbola.                                    t  =  shaded  area
                                                                                    2

Solution: Since                                         O1 x
                     x2 - y2 = cosh2 t - sinh2 t = 1                     x2 - y2 = 1

for all t, then the points (x, y) = (cosh t,sinh t) lie on the unit
hyperbola x2 - y2 = 1. This was in fact shown in Section 7.5, where t is half the area of the shaded

region in the above figure for t > 0. For t < 0 the shaded region is reflected below the x-axis. Since

cosh t  1 and sinh t can take any value, then the entire right branch of the hyperbola is traced as t

varies. Likewise the left branch has parametric equations x = - cosh t and y = sinh t. The hyperbola

is thus parametrized by area (or negative area for t < 0). In general, for a > 0 and b > 0 the hyperbola
ax22 - by22 = 1 has parametric equations x = ±a cosh t and y = b sinh t for all t.

   For three control points B0, B1, B2, pick 0  t  1. Say t = 0.4, which you can think of as a percentage:
0.4 = 40%. Let A0 and A1 be the points 40% of the way from B0 to B1 and from B1 to B2, respectively,
as in Figure 7.6.2(a). Then the point P that is 40% of the way from A0 to A1 is on the Bézier curve B
joining B0 and B2. Do this for every t in [0,1] to fill out the curve B, as in Figure 7.6.2(b).

   It can be shown via de Casteljau's algorithm that the Bézier curve B for any three control points

B0 = (x0, y0), B1 = (x1, y1) and B2 = (x2, y2) in the x y-plane has parametric equations

x = (1 - t)2 x0 + 2t (1 - t) x1 + t2 x2 and y = (1 - t)2 y0 + 2t (1 - t) y1 + t2 y2             (7.13)

for 0  t  1. Write out and simplify the explicit parametric equations for the Bézier curve B with control
points B0 = (1,2), B1 = (2,4) and B2 = (4,1).
Solution: The parametric equations for B0 = (x0, y0) = (1, 2), B1 = (x1, y1) = (2, 4), B2 = (x2, y2) = (4, 1) are:

                x = (1 - t)2(1) + 2t (1 - t) (2) + t2(4) = 1 - 2t + t2 + 4t - 4t2 + 4t2 = t2 + 2t + 1
                y = (1 - t)2(2) + 2t (1 - t) (4) + t2(1) = 2 - 4t + 2t2 + 8t - 8t2 + t2 = -5t2 + 4t + 2

   A curve with parametric equations x = x(t) and y = y(t) might not be the graph of a single
function y = f (x), but the derivative dx dy can still be found by using the differentials of x and y

      Figure 7.6.3 Cycloid C for a circle of radius a

Find parametric equations for C and find dx dy .
Solution: For the angles t and --measured in radians--shown in Figure 7.6.3, t +  + /2 = 2, so
t = 3/2 - . The point P touches the origin as the circle rolls, so the horizontal distance from the
circle's center to the y-axis is the length of the circular arc with central angle , namely a. So by the
parametrization of the circle as in Example 7.13, but with center (h, k) = (a, a), radius r = a, and  = 1,

x = a  + a cos t = a   + cos      3    = a ( - sin )

                                  2 -

y = a + a sin t = a  1 + sin      3    = a (1 - cos )

                                  2 -

Thus, C : x = a( - sin ), y = a(1 - cos ), - <  <  is a parametrization of the cycloid C.

   As in formula (7.14) the derivative dx dy is given by:

                 dy y()              a sin                 =  sin   = cot 2 1
                      = =
                 dx x () a (1 - cos ) 1 - cos 

Thus, dx dy is undefined when cos  = 1, namely, when  = 2k for all integers k, i.e. when x = a ( - sin ) =
a(2k - sin 2k) = 2ka. Notice from Figure 7.6.3 that the cycloid has cusps at those values of x.

   A cycloid appears in the solution of the famous brachistochrone problem:14 A
find the plane curve joining two points A and B--where B is at a lower height

than A but not directly under it--along which an object slides frictionless

under the force of gravity alone from A to B in the shortest time. It turns out

that the optimal path is not a straight line, but part of an inverted (upside-             B
down) cycloid with a cusp at A, as in the figure on the right.15

    minor auxiliary circle. This circle is parametrized by x = b cos t and y = b sin t for 0  t  2, with the
    angle t shown in Figure 7.6.4. From each point on that circle draw a horizontal line segment to the
    point P on the ellipse in the same quadrant, as shown. Show that P = (acos t, b sin t).

7.7 Polar Coordinates

Suppose that you wanted to write the equation of a spiral, like the one in Figure 7.7.1. The
curve is clearly not the graph of a function y = f (x) in Cartesian coordinates, as it violates the
vertical line test. However, this spiral is simple to express using polar coordinates.16 Recall
that any point P distinct from the origin (denoted by O) in the x y-plane is a distance r > 0

   The pair (r, ) contains the polar coordinates of P, and the positive x-axis is called the polar
axis of this coordinate system. For the angle  measured in radians, (r, ) = (r,  + 2k) for
all integers k. Thus, the polar coordinates of a point are not unique. By convention r can be

                                                                                           --

direction from the angle , as in Figure 7.7.3. When r = 0, the point (r, ) = (0, ) is the origin
O, regardless of the value of .

Example 7.18

Express the spiral in Figure 7.7.1 in polar coordinates, such that the distance between any two points
separated by 2 radians is always 1.
Solution: The goal is to find some equation involving r and  (measured in radians) that describes the
spiral. The distance between any two points separated by 2 radians is always 1, for example:

                                                     =0  r=1
                                                    = 2  r = 2
                                                    = 4  r = 3

                                                                ...
                                                  = 2 k  r = 1 + k

for all integers k  0. In fact r = 1 + k when  = 2k for all real k  0, by the assumption about the

distance.  So  solving  for  k  in  terms  of    yields  the  polar  equation  r  =1+     for  all     0.

where r is constant (e.g. r = 1, r = 2), while the lines through the origin are where  is constant,
at regular intervals for each. The angle  shown here is in degrees, though radians are often

   In general, polar coordinates are useful in describing plane curves that exhibit symmetry
about the origin (though there are other situations), which arise in many physical applications.

   Figure 7.7.5 shows how to convert between polar coordinates and Carte-    y (x, y) (r,)
sian coordinates. Namely, for a point with polar coordinates (r, ) and          ry
Cartesian coordinates (x, y):

Polar to Cartesian:                                                                         x
                                x = r cos 
                                            y = r sin          (7.17) O x

Cartesian to Polar:                                                          Figure 7.7.5

r = ± x2 + y2                               tan  = y if x = 0  (7.18)
                                                        x

   In formula (7.18), if x = 0 then  = /2 or  = 3/2. If x = 0 and y = 0 then the two possible
solutions for  in the equation tan = xy are in opposite quadrants (for 0   < 2). If the angle
 is in the same quadrant as the point (x, y), then r = x2 + y2 (i.e. r is positive); otherwise

r = - x2 + y2 (i.e. r is negative).

Example 7.19

Write the equation of the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 in polar coordinates.
Solution: By formula (7.18), r2 = x2 + y2 = 1, so in polar coordinates the equation is simply r = 1. In
general the circle x2 + y2 = a2 of radius a > 0 has the simpler expression r = a in polar coordinates.

Example 7.20
Write the equation x2 + (y - 4)2 = 16 in polar coordinates.
Solution: This is the equation of a circle of radius 4 centered at the point (0,4). Expand the equation:

         x2 + (y - 4)2 = 16                 (by formulas (7.17) and (7.18))
x2 + y2 - 8y + 16 = 16

                x2 + y2 = 8y
                        r2 = 8 r sin 
                         r = 8 sin 

Is it valid to cancel r from both sides in the last step? Yes. The point (0,0) is on the circle, so canceling
r does not eliminate r = 0 as a potential solution of the equation (e.g.  = 0 would make r = 8 sin  = 0).
Thus, the polar equation is r = 8 sin .

Notice that this polar equation is actually less intuitive than its Cartesian equivalent. From the equa-
tion x2 + (y - 4)2 = 16 it is easy to identify the curve as a circle and read off its radius and center; these
properties are not so obvious from the polar equation. Since the circle's center is not the origin, there is
no symmetry about the origin, which is when polar coordinates are often better suited.

Derivatives in Polar Coordinates

   Suppose that the polar coordinates (r, ) for a plane curve are related by a function: r = r().
Then by formula (7.17), x = r() cos  and y = r() sin  are now parametric equations for the
curve in the parameter . Thus, by the Product Rule and formulas (7.14) and (7.15) from
Section 7.6, with dx = x() d and dy = y() d:

For a plane curve with polar equation r = r(),                                                                             (7.19)

Integration in Polar Coordinates

   In some cases polar coordinates can simplify evaluation of a definite integral or finding an
area. To determine the polar form of a definite integral, suppose that r is a function of :
r = f (). A polar region swept out by r = f () between  =  and  =  would look like the
shaded region in Figure 7.7.7 with area A:

   A typical infinitesimal wedge of that region--shown in Figure 7.7.8--is produced by an in-

finitesimal change d in the angle , which results in an infinitesimal change dr in r. By the
Microstraightness Property, the curve r = f () is a straight line with infinitesimal length ds
over that infinitesimal angle d. The area dA of the wedge thus equals the area of the trian-
gle with sides of lengths r and r + dr with included angle d and a side of length ds. Since
sin d = d and dr = f () d, then by the formula for the area of a triangle (as shown in Figure
7.7.9),18

since (d)2 = 0. The area A of the region is the sum of these infinitesimal areas dA:

For a plane curve with polar equation r = f (), the area A of the region swept out between

If f is periodic then choose the angle interval [, ] so that the area is swept out only once.

Example 7.22

Use polar coordinates to show that the area of a circle of radius R is R2.

Solution: Let the origin be the center of the circle. Then r = R is the polar equation of the circle, with
0    2 sweeping out exactly one full circle. The area A inside the circle is then

                           2 1 2          2                          2

Note the simplicity of this integral compared to the trigonometric substitution required when using
Cartesian coordinates, as in Section 6.3. Notice also that using a larger interval--say [0,4]--for 
would result in an incorrect area (4R2) even though the region inside the curve is the same.

8.1 Area Between Curves

The "area under a curve" was defined in Chapter 5 as the area below some curve y = f (x) and
above the x-axis over some interval. That was a special case of the area between curves,
where in general one curve y = f1(x) is not necessarily always above another curve y = f2(x)
over the entire interval, as in Figure 8.1.1 for an interval [a, b].

               y dx
                                        y = f1(x)
                                                                     dA
                                                                          h(x) = | f1(x) - f2(x)|

        Figure 8.1.1 The area A between two curves y = f1(x) and y = f2(x) over [a, b]

   The area A of the region between the curves in Figure 8.1.1 cannot be negative. Thus, a
typical infinitesimal area element dA of the region is of the form h(x) dx, where the height
function h(x) is the nonnegative difference in the y-coordinates of the curves at each x in
[a, b]: h(x) = f1(x) - f2(x) . Hence:

The area A between two curves y = f1(x) and y = f2(x) over an interval [a, b] is:

                         b     b  f1(x) - f2(x) dx                                      (8.1)

           A = dA =

                      a     a

The interval [a, b] can be replaced by any interval--finite or infinite--over which the inte-
gral is defined. Neither curve is required to be above the x-axis.

Find the area between y = ex and y = e-x over [0,2].
                                                                                                              y = e-x
Solution: Since ex  e-x for x in [0,2], the height function h(x) for the region                       0 2x
between the curves over [0, 2] is h(x) = ex - e-x = ex - e-x. The area A of

Solution: A "bounded" region will always mean a region of finite area, as op-
posed to unbounded regions. The curves y = x2 and y = x intersect at x = 0 and                         01 x
x = 1, so the region the curves bound is the shaded region shown in the figure
on the right. Since x  x2 for 0  x  1, then the height function for the region                               y = sin x
is h(x) = |x2 - x| = x - x2. The region's area A is then                                                     y = cos x

Formula (8.1) can be extended to find the area between any number of curves, by splitting the
integral over subintervals with different height functions.

Example 8.4

Find the area of the region bounded by y = 6 - x2, y = x and y = -5x above the x-axis.

Solution: As shown in the figure on the right, above the x-axis the curve                    y

y = 6 - x2 intersects the line y = x at x = 2 and intersects the line y = -5x  y = -5x
                2                             2
at x = -1. Since 6- x  -5x over [-1,0] and 6- x  x over [0,2], the area
                                                                                                y = 6 - x2
A of the shaded region needs to be split into two integrals:                                          y=x
                                                                                                         x

             = 0 - -6 + 13 + 52 + 12 - 83 - 2 - 0 = 212

For some areas between curves it might be easier to switch the roles of x and y, so that instead
of a vertical height function you would use a horizontal width function.

Example 8.5                                                                               y     y=x

Find the area of the region bounded by x = y2 - 2 and y = x.
                                                                                    w( y)          2
Solution: As shown in the figure on the right, the parabola x = y2 - 2
intersects the line y = x at x = -1 and x = 2. The region has differ-    -2 -1 0
ent height functions h(x) for -2  x  -1 and -1  x  2, so that two
integrals would be required for the area A. However, notice that the
width function w(y) has one definition over the entire region between
the curves x = y2 - 2 and x = y: w(y) = y - (y2 - 2) = y - (y2 - 2).
Thus, instead of integrating the vertical strips dA = h(x) dx along the
x-axis, integrate the horizontal strips dA = w(y) dy along the y-axis,
from y = -1 to y = 2:

                      A=     2                    2

                                w(y) dy =            y - (y2 - 2) dy

   The area between curves given by polar equations can be found                                    y

similarly. For example, consider curves r = r1() and r = r2() with                                       =           =

region between the curves and those angles is simply the difference                                    r2

between the "outer" and "inner" areas, each given by formula (7.20):

In general, to include cases where the "outer" and "inner" curves
switch positions, take the absolute value of the difference:

   The area A between two polar curves r = r1() and r = r2() for      is:

   Monte Carlo integration is a technique for approximating y
the area of a region by taking a large number of random points
in a rectangle that encloses the region (see Figure 8.1.3). The
idea is simple:

         # of points in the region                    area of the region
       # of points in the rectangle  area of the rectangle

For example, if 20% of the random points in the rectangle fall x

inside the region, then--by randomness--you would expect the                                        Figure 8.1.3

area of the region to be about 20% of the area of the rectangle.

The more random points you take, the better the approximation. Since the area of the rectangle

is known, as well as the number of random points inside the region and the rectangle, the area

of the region is easy to approximate.

Example 8.7

Use Monte Carlo integration to approximate the area of the region y          y = ex2
in the first quadrant above the curves y = ex2 and y = 2 cos x2, and
inside the circle x2 + y2 = 9.                                        3

Solution: The region is the shaded area shown in the figure on the

right, enclosed in a rectangle of width 2 and height 3. The area of the 2             x2 + y2 = 9
rectangle is 6, and a point (x, y) in the rectangle is inside the region

if only if the following conditions are met:  x2 + y2 < 9             1 y = 2 cos x2
              y > ex2 and y > 2 cos x2 and

Notice that these conditions are all in the form of inequalities. The 0 1 2 3 x

Monte Carlo integration is then simple to perform in Octave, using 10 million random points:

octave> N = 1e7;

octave> x = 2*rand(1,N);
octave> y = 3*rand(1,N);
octave> 6*(sum(y > exp(x.^2) & y > 2*cos(x.^2) & x.^2 + y.^2 < 9))/N
ans = 0.94612

The actual value--accurate to 5 decimal places--is 0.94606.
   The rand(1,N) command returns an array of N random numbers between 0 and 1. So the statement

x = 2*rand(1,N) stores N random numbers between 0 and 2 in an array for the x-coordinates, and the
statement y = 3*rand(1,N) stores N random numbers between 0 and 3 in an array for the y-coordinates.
The statement y > exp(x.^2) returns a value of 1 if the condition y > ex2 is met, 0 otherwise. Similarly
for the statements y > 2*cos(x.^2) and x.^2 + y.^2 < 9. Joining those three statements with & sym-
bols returns a value of 1 if all three conditions are met, 0 otherwise. The sum command thus counts how
many of the N points are inside the region. Dividing that count by N gives the ratio of points inside the
region, then multiplying by 6 (the area of the rectangle) gives the approximate area of the region.

   Note that the size of the rectangle can affect the approximation--generally the larger the rectangle
the more points must be used. Note also in this example that finding the area by using definite integrals
would require numerical integration methods, since f (x) = ex2 and f (x) = 2 cos x2 cannot be integrated
in a closed form. In fact, even finding the points of intersection of the three curves--in order to split the
integrals--would require a numerical root-finding method (e.g. Newton's method).

8.2 Average Value of a Function

According to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, a planet revolv-                      planet

ing around the Sun follows an elliptical orbit, with the Sun at one

focus of the ellipse, as in Figure 8.2.1. The distance d between         d
the planet and the Sun varies over the ellipse, reaching a min-         Sun

imum distance and a maximum distance (by the Extreme Value

Theorem). How would you find the average distance between the           Figure 8.2.1
planet and the Sun over one complete orbit? The idea is to gener-

alize the usual notion of an average of numbers.

Recall that for n numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn the average, denoted by x¯, is simply the sum of the

numbers divided by how many numbers there are, namely

x¯ = x1 + x2 + · · · + xn .
                   n

In statistics x¯ is called the mean of x1, x2, . . . , xn. This definition makes sense for a finite set
of numbers, but in the case of a planet revolving around the Sun, there are an uncountably
infinite number of distances between the planet and the Sun, making the above definition
impossible to use. A way of taking a sum over an infinite continuum of values is needed
instead. Such a method has already been encountered: the definite integral, which is merely a
sum of a continuum of infinitesimal quantities.

   To motivate the definition of the average value of y       f (x2)    f (xn-1)
a function f over a closed interval [a, b], denoted by    f (x1)            f (xn)
 f , consider a partition

P = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xn-1 < xn = b}            f (x0)              ...

that divides [a, b] into n subintervals [xi-1, xi] of                                                      x
                                                                        x2 . . . xn-1 xn = b
equal length xi = xi - xi-1 = (b - a)/n, as in Fig-       a = x0 x1     xi = xi - xi-1 = (b - a)/n
ure 8.2.2. The n function values f (x1), f (x2), . . . ,

f (xn) constitute only a finite subset of all the func-   Figure 8.2.2
tion values f (x) over [a, b], so their average would

be an approximation of the true function average  f , namely:

 f   f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xn) n = f (xi)
n                                                         i=1 n

By properties of summations, divide the entire sum by the constant b - a and multiply each
term in the sum by b - a to get:

Note that the last summation on the right is just a Riemann sum for the definite integral

to n. Thus, taking the limit of that sum as n   (which means including more and more

function values in the average) yields the following definition:

The average value  f  of a function f over a closed interval [a, b] is:1

Example 8.8
Find the average value of f (x) = x2 over [0,1].
Solution: By definition, with a = 0 and b = 1,

                                  1     1                    x 1 2 dx = x3  1 13 03 1

                                          f (x) dx =

                                       0

Note that this says that if you took all the numbers between 0 and 1 and squared them, then the average
of those squares would be 1/3.

Example 8.9
Find the average value of f (x) = x2 over [-1,1].
Solution: By definition, with a = -1 and b = 1,

                                1      f 1 (x) dx = 1        x 1 2 dx = x3   1      13 (-1)3 1
                   f  = 1 - (-1)

Note that this is the same as the average over [0,1], as shown in the previous example. This should
make sense, since the function f (x) = x2 is symmetric about the y-axis, so the values of f (x) from [-1,0]
are the same as those from [0,1]. The values from [-1,1] just duplicate the values from [0,1] and hence
do not change the average.

Find the average value of f (x) = sin x over [0,].
Solution: By definition, with a = 0 and b = ,

               1       f (x) dx = 1  sin x dx = - 1  cos x = - 1 (cos  - cos 0) = - 1 (-1 - 1) = 2

                 = 25

       d2 = (4x - 25)2           , and so taking square roots gives
                    25

                 d = ± 4x - 25 5 = - 4x - 25 5 = 25 - 4x 5

for -5  x  5, since d = (4x - 25)/5 < 0 on [-5,5] and the distance cannot be negative. Note that by
symmetry of the ellipse about the x-axis, only the upper half of the ellipse is needed for the average
distance, since the lower half just duplicates the distances. Hence, the average distance is

              1  5 25 - 4x dx = 1 (25x - 2x2 5 ) = 1 (125 - 50 - (-125 - 50)) = 5 .
d =
5 - (-5) -5 5                        50     -5 50

                                                                                              x2 y2

Notice that the point (4,0) is a focus of the ellipse 25 + 9 = 1 (why?), which as it turns out makes the
calculation of the average distance fairly simple.

   What if you wanted the average value of a function f that is not easily integrable? One
alternative to numerical integration techniques is the Monte Carlo method. The idea behind
it is simple: go back to the usual definition of an average, by taking a large number N of
random numbers x1, x2, . . . , xN in [a, b] and then using the approximation

                                         f   f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xN) .
                                                                    N

This might seem like taking a step backward from calculus, and it is, but it is surprisingly
useful, as well as simple to implement with a computer. In addition, it can be shown that as
the number of random points in [a, b] increases, the approximations converge to the actual
average.

Example 8.12
The Monte Carlo method is easy to implement in Octave/MATLAB. Typically only a "one-liner" is
needed, owing to Octave's vectorization--i.e. the ability to perform mathematical operations on entire
arrays of objects all at once.
For example, recall from Example 8.8 that the average value of f (x) = x2 over [0,1] is 1/3 = 0.33333 ... .
Approximate the average value using an array of 100 million (108) random numbers in [0,1]:

  octave> mean(rand(1,1e8).^2)
  ans = 0.3333292094741531

The dot in the rand(1,1e8).^2 command applies the squaring operation (^2) to each of the 108 random
numbers in the array returned by the rand(1,1e8) command. The aggregate mean function then calcu-
lates the array's mean. Trigonometric, exponential and other functions can be applied to arrays, with
the function evaluating each array element individually. In general the command (b - a).*rand(1,N)+a
will return an array of N random numbers in the interval (a, b).
For example, the function f (x) = sin (x2) cannot be integrated in a closed form, but its average value
over [,2] can be approximated easily in Octave (actual average = -0.04154374531416104):

  octave> mean(sin((pi.*rand(1,1e8)+pi).^2))
  ans = -0.04153426177596753

10. Electrical signals are commonly represented by a periodic waveform x(t), which is a function of
    time t and has period T (i.e. T is the smallest positive number such that x(t + T) = x(t) for all t). The
    average power of the waveform is defined as the average value of its square over a single period:

                            x2(t)      1   T
                                   =T

8.3 Arc Length and Curvature

Just like the area of a plane region can be found using calculus, so too can the length of a plane
curve. Along the way the mystery mentioned in a footnote in Chapter 1 will finally be solved:
what is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with infinitesimal sides?

   For a function y = f (x) denote by s the length of the piece of that curve over an interval [a, b],
as in Figure 8.3.1 (a). Call s the curve's arc length over [a, b].

y                                            ds                          ds

   (a) Arc length s

                                      Figure 8.3.1 Arc length

   By the Microstraightness Property, for a  x < b the curve is a straight line of length ds over
the infinitesimal interval [x, x + dx], as in Figure 8.3.1 (b), where ds > 0 is the infinitesimal
change in s over that interval. Notice that you cannot simply apply the Pythagorean Theorem
here, since that would make ds = (dx)2 + (dy)2 = 0 + 0 = 0, which is false. The trick is
to divide all sides of this infinitesimal right triangle by dx, which yields the similar--and

noninfinitesimal--right triangle shown in Figure 8.3.1(c). The Pythagorean Theorem can then

be applied to that triangle:

                             ds       12 + dy  ds = 2  1 + dy 2 dx
                             dx =            dx              dx

Summing up those infinitesimal lengths ds then yields the arc length s:

The arc length s of a curve y = f (x) over [a, b] is:

                                         b      b      1 + dy 2 dx                            (8.4)
                                                             dx
                                   s = ds =

   That such a formula exists is of course good news, but as you have probably guessed, the in-
tegral cannot be evaluated in a closed form except for a few functions.2 In most cases numerical
integration methods will be required.

of the ellipse is:       2.                                                                            2

The integral E(k) for 0 < k < 1 cannot be evaluated in a closed form. There are tables4 for

certain values of k between 0 and 1, but a number of scientific computing applications have

built-in functions to evaluate elliptic integrals.                                                                 x2 y2

a = 5, b = 3, c =                           and  e=    c  = 0.8,     so  s = 4a E(e) = 20 E(0.8).              In  the  Python-based

               elliptic_e(,k2).

   The parametric formula for arc length can be derived by dividing all sides of the infinitesimal
right triangle in Figure 8.3.1(b) by dt, then applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the resulting
noninfinitesimal right triangle:

The polar formula for arc length can be considered a special case of the parametric formula.

A polar curve r = r() for      has Cartesian coordinates x = r() cos  and y = r() sin ,

so that               dx = dr cos  - r sin  and dy = dr sin  + r cos  .

                      d d                                 d d

It is left as an exercise to show that putting these derivatives into formula (8.5)--using the

parameter  instead of t--yields the polar arc length formula:

The arc length s of a polar curve r = r() for      is:

Curvature

   In Chapter 4 you saw one simple measure of curvature: the sec-                      y
ond derivative. From Figure 8.3.2 it is clear that the parabola y = x2
is less curved at the point (1, 1) than at the origin, yet dx2 d2 y = 2 at each        1
point. So the second derivative--the rate of change of the slopes dx dy                            y = x2
of the tangent lines--does not fully capture the curvature of a curve;
more information is needed. It turns out that the rate of change of                    0     1              x
the angles of the tangent lines is the key to curvature.
                                                                                       Figure 8.3.2
   First consider a curve with arc length s between two points A and

B on the curve. Let  be the angle between the tangent lines to the curve at A and B, as in

Figure 8.3.3(a).

                                   B                                                B

                  A                                                      A
                  (a) Small curvature
                                                                  (b) Larger curvature and 

                     Figure 8.3.3 Curvature between A and B: same s, different 

For the same arc length s but larger angle  as in Figure 8.3.3(b), the curvature appears
greater. This suggests that curvature should measure  relative to s:

The average curvature ¯ AB of a curve between two points A and B on the curve is

                                                ¯ AB =                                               (8.7)
                                                           s

where s is the arc length of the curve between A and B, and  is the angle between the
tangent lines to the curve at A and B, called the angle of contingence.
268 Chapter 8 · Applications of Integrals                                                  §8.3

   Similar to how the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point is the average rate
of change over an infinitesimal interval, the curvature of a curve at a point can be defined as
the average curvature over an infinitesimal length of the curve:

The curvature  of a curve at a point A on the curve is

                   = d                                                                     (8.8)
                         ds

where s is the arc length function of the curve and  is the angle that the tangent line to
the curve at A makes with the positive x-axis.

The idea is that moving an infinitesimal length ds along the curve induces an infinitesimal
difference d in the angles of the tangent lines. Roughly, as B moves toward A:

              lim ¯ AB = lim  = d = 
              BA  BA s ds

Curvature can be viewed as the instantaneous rate of change of direction of a curve, but with
respect to arc length (i.e. distance traveled) instead of time.

   For a curve y = f (x), recall from formula (3.2) in Section 3.1 that  = (x) = tan-1 f (x) at
each point (x, f (x)) on the curve. Thus, by the Chain Rule:

                                                         f (x) dx
                     d d (tan-1 f (x)) 1 + ( f (x))2
               = ds = ds = ds

So since ds = 1 + ( f (x))2 dx by formula (8.4), then:

The curvature  of a curve y = f (x) is:                                                    (8.9)
                                                               f (x)

                                                 = (1 + ( f (x))2)3/2

The above formula makes  a function of x. Note also that  = 0 for a straight line, and that
the curve y = f (x) is concave up if  > 0 and concave down if  < 0.

Example 8.17

Find the curvature of the curve y = x2 for x = 0 and x = 1.
Solution: For f (x) = x2, f (x) = 2x and f (x) = 2, so for any x the curvature  = (x) is:

                  f (x)                                                2
               = (1 + ( f (x))2)3/2 = (1 + 4x2)3/2

In particular, (0) = 2 and (1) = 532/2  0.1789. So y = x2 has more curvature at the origin than at (1,1).

  For a parametric curve x = x(t), y = y(t), the curvature  will be a function of the parameter

               dy y(t)

t. Since dx = x(t) by formula (7.14) in Section 7.6, then by formula (7.15):

                                      d dy       d y(t)
                           d2 y dt dx
                           dx2 = dx           =  dt x(t)  =      x(t) y(t) - y(t) x(t)

So by formula (8.9):

   d2 y         x(t) y(t) - y(t) x(t)

=  dx2 2 3/2 =                                     (x(t))3                x(t) y(t) - y(t) x(t)

   1 + dy                                                        (x(t))            1 + x(t)

                                                     x (t)

Simplify the denominator to obtain the parametric curvature formula:

The curvature  of a parametric curve x = x(t), y = y(t) is:                                      (8.10)
                                                   x(t) y(t) - y(t) x(t)

                                             = (x(t))2 + ( y(t))2 3/2

The derivation of the curvature formula in polar coordinates is left as an exercise:             (8.11)

  The curvature  of a polar curve r = r() is:
                                                (r())2 + 2 (r())2 - r() r()

                                          = (r())2 + (r())2 3/2

Example 8.18
Find the curvature of a circle of radius R.
Solution: Use the polar curve r = r() = R, so that r() = 0 = r():

                              (r())2 + 2 (r())2 - r() r() R2 + 2 · 02 - R · 0 R2 1
                        = (r())2 + (r())2 3/2 = (R2 + 02)3/2 = R3 = R

A circle thus has constant curvature, as you would expect by symmetry. It turns out that any planar

8.4 Surfaces and Solids of Revolution

Long before calculus was invented the ancient Greeks (e.g. Archimedes) discovered the formu-
las for the volume and surface area of familiar three-dimensional objects such as the sphere.7
Volumes and surface areas of arbitrary solids and surfaces can be found using multivariable
calculus. However, single-variable calculus can be used in the special case of the objects pos-
sessing symmetry about an axis, via methods that involve revolving a curve or region in the
x y-plane around an axis.

   For example, revolve a curve y = f (x)  0 around the x-axis, for a  x  b. This produces a
surface of revolution in three dimensions, as in Figure 8.4.1(a).

y                                    y                              y

   y = f (x)                            y = f (x)                            ds

                 x                                               x           f (x) f (x + dx)
                                                                                                      x
   a          b                         a  xb
                                                                                   dx

      Figure 8.4.1 Surface of revolution over [a, b] with lateral surface area S

To find the total lateral surface area S, pick x in [a, b) then find the          r1

infinitesimal surface area dS swept out over the infinitesimal interval

[x, x + dx], as in Figure 8.4.1(b). By the Microstraightness Property, the                               l

curve y = f (x) is a straight line segment of length ds over that interval,       r2

so that the infinitesimal surface is a frustrum--a right circular cone

with the vertex chopped off by a plane parallel to the base circle. From     Figure 8.4.2
geometry8 you might recall the formula for the lateral surface area of the

frustrum in Figure 8.4.2:  (r1 + r2) l. Use that formula with r1 = f (x), r2 = f (x+ dx) = f (x)+ dy,
and l = ds = 1 + ( f (x))2 dx (by formula (8.4) in Section 8.3) as in Figure 8.4.1(c), so that dS is

                             dS =  ( f (x) + ( f (x) + dy)) 1 + ( f (x))2 dx
                                  = 2  f (x) 1 + ( f (x))2 dx +  1 + ( f (x))2 dy dx
                                  = 2  f (x) 1 + ( f (x))2 dx + 0

since dy dx = f (x) (dx)2 = 0. The surface area S is then the sum of all the areas dS:

The surface area S of the surface of revolution obtained by revolving the curve y = f (x)  0
around the x-axis for a  x  b is:

                    b         b
        S = dS = 2  f (x) 1 + ( f (x))2 dx                                              (8.12)

        a                  a

For a general curve y = f (x), possibly negative in [a, b], the surface area S is:

    b                  b                    b         1 + ( f (x))2 dx
S = dS = 2  | y| ds = 2  f (x)                                                          (8.13)

    a               a                      a

Note that formula (8.13) holds by symmetry and formula (8.12). A y          y = f (x)
curve y = f (x) < 0 and the curve y = f (x) = - f (x) are symmet-
ric with respect to the x-axis, as in the figure on the right. Thus,        a                 x
both curves sweep out the same surface of revolution when revolved           y = f (x)  b
around the x-axis. This means formula (8.13) also holds if y = f (x)
changes sign in [a, b]: similar to the area between two curves, you
would split the integral over different subintervals depending on
the sign.

Example 8.19                                                                y
                                                                                       y = r2 - x2
Show that the surface area of a sphere of radius r is 4r2.                             rx

Solution: Use the circle x2+ y2 = r2. The upper half of that circle is the
curve y = f (x) = r2 - x2 over the interval [-r, r], as in the figure on
the right. Revolving that curve around the x-axis produces a sphere
of radius r, whose surface area S is:

S = r 2  f (x) 1 + ( f (x))2 dx -r

           -r

        r                   -x 2
                                        dx
= 2 r2 - x2 1 +

   A similar derivation using a frustrum yields the surface area S of the surface of revolution
obtained by revolving a curve y = f (x) around the y-axis, for 0  a  x  b:

S=       b                 b                    b     1 + ( f (x))2 dx                  (8.14)

   Now suppose you revolve the region between a curve y = f (x)  0 and the x-axis around
the x-axis, for a  x  b (see Figure 8.4.3(a)). This produces a solid of revolution in three
dimensions, as in Figure 8.4.3(b). Notice that this solid consists of the surface of revolution as
before along with its interior.

                                                                                      (c) Infinitesimal strip

                             Figure 8.4.3 Solid of revolution over [a, b] with volume area V

   The goal is to find the volume V of this solid. The idea is to divide the solid into slices,

like a loaf of bread. First, the infinitesimal volume dV of the frustrum swept out by a strip

of infinitesimal width dx at x in [a, b)--shown in Figure 8.4.3(c)--is needed. By the Micros-

traightness Property the curve y = f (x) is a straight line of length ds over the interval [x, x+dx].

There is thus a right triangle at the top of the strip--unshaded in Figure 8.4.3(c)--whose area
                    1                       1  f (x)(dx)2
A  is  zero:  A  =  2  (  d  y)(  dx  )  =  2              = 0.

   That triangle thus contributes no volume when revolved around the x-axis:                                 dx
the volume dV swept out by that strip all comes from the shaded rectangle of                             f (x)
height f (x) and width dx. That rectangle sweeps out a right circular cylinder
of radius f (x) and height dx (see Figure 8.4.4). The volume of a right circular
cylinder of radius r and height h is defined as the area of the base circle times
the height: r2h. Hence,

                                               dV =  ( f (x))2 dx .                               Figure 8.4.4

The total volume V of the solid is then the sum of all those infinitesimal volumes dV :

   The volume V of the solid of revolution obtained by revolving the region between the curve
   y = f (x) and the x-axis around the x-axis for a  x  b is:

                                                              b         b
                                               V = dV =  ( f (x))2 dx                                    (8.15)

                                                           a         a

This method for finding the volume is called the disc method, since the cylinder of volume
dV resembles a disc. Think of the discs as being similar to infinitesimally thin slices of a loaf
of bread. Notice that absolute values are not needed in formula (8.15) since f (x) is squared, so
the formula holds even when f (x) is negative.

Example 8.20                                                                      y

                                                           3

Solution: Use the circle x2 + y2 = r2. Revolve the region between the
upper half of the circle y = f (x) = r2 - x2 and the x-axis around the
x-axis over the interval [-r, r], as in the figure on the right. The solid
of revolution swept out is a sphere of radius r, whose volume V is:

V =  r ( f (x))2 dx =  r (r2 - x2) dx =  r2 x - 1 x3 r -r
                                                                  3
            -r                     -r                                -r

   Instead of memorizing formula (8.15), try to remember the more generic approach of revolv-
ing an infinitesimal rectangular strip around an axis, which might not be the x-axis. The idea
is to find the radius r and height h--typically dx or dy--of the disc swept out by that strip, so
that the disc's volume is dV = r2h. Then integrate dV over the appropriate interval to find
the volume V of the entire solid.

Example 8.21

Suppose the region bounded by the curve y = x2 and the x-axis for 0  x  1 is revolved around the line
x = 1. Find the volume of the resulting solid of revolution.

Solution: The region is shaded in the figure on the right. Since the              y x=1
region is revolved around a vertical axis, the disc method will use            1 y = x2
discs with height dy, not dx. At a point x in [0,1] go up to the curve
y = x2 and draw a horizontal rectangular strip to the line x = 1, as

line x = 1, producing a disc of radius r - 1 - x and height h = dy. x shown in the figure. Let h = dy and revolve that strip around the 2 = y r h x
Since y = x2 implies x = y, the volume dV of that disc is                      0x 1

                    dV =  r2h =  (1 - x)2 dy =  (1 - y)2 dy =  (1 - 2 y + y) dy .

The volume V of the entire solid is then the sum of those volumes dV along the y-axis for 0  y  1:

   Just like the strip in the disc method, the right triangle at the top of this strip--as in Figure
8.4.5(b)--has zero area and thus does not contribute to the volume dV of the right circular
cylindrical shell swept out by the strip, shown in Figure 8.4.5(c). The volume of that shell is
just the volume of the "outer" cylinder of radius x+ dx minus the volume of the "inner" cylinder
of radius x, both with height f (x):

               dV =  (x + dx)2 f (x) -  x2 f (x)                    2 0

                   = 2  x f (x) dx

The volume V of the entire solid is then the sum of those volumes dV , using an absolute value
to handle any sign for f (x):

The volume V of the solid of revolution obtained by revolving the region between the curve
y = f (x) and the x-axis around the y-axis for 0  a  x  b is:

   The volume dV in formula (8.16) can be generalized to dV = 2rhw, where r is the distance
from the axis of revolution to a generic vertical strip of infinitesimal width w in the region, and
h is the height of the strip.

8.5 Applications in Physics and Statistics

This chapter concludes with a few applications showing how some familiar discrete sums can
be replaced by integrals, which are essentially continuous sums.

Center of Gravity

   Suppose a thin uniform rod has n > 1 masses m1, . . ., mn attached, with m1 and mn at the
ends. The center of gravity of the masses is the point where--due to the Earth's gravity--the

rod would be balanced if a fulcrum were placed there (see Figure 8.5.1(a)). Imagine the rod

as part of the x-axis and the weights as point masses--with each mass mk at xk--and let the
center of gravity be at x¯, as in Figure 8.5.1(b).

m1 m2 · · · mn-1 mn                 m1 m2 · · · mn-1 mn                             x
(a) Rod balanced on fulcrum
                                    x1 x2         x¯ xn-1 xn

                   Figure 8.5.1 Center of gravity x¯ for masses m1,... , mn

   The rod is balanced if the masses do not rotate the rod, i.e. the total torque is zero. Torque

is defined here as force times position relative to x¯. Each mass mk applies a force mk g to the
rod--where g is the (downward) acceleration due to the Earth's gravity--at position (xx - x¯)
relative to x¯. The total torque is thus zero if

(m1 g) (x1 - x¯) + (m2 g) (x2 - x¯) + · · · + (mn g) (xn - x¯) = 0

so that solving for x¯ yields:

x¯ = m1 gx1 + · · · + mn gxn = m1 x1 + · · · + mn xn =  n                    mk xk     (8.17)
                                                        k=1

                   m1g +··· + mn g  m1 +··· + mn        k= n 1 mk

Each quantity mk xk is called the moment of the mass mk. Thus, x¯ is the sum of the moments
divided by the total mass. This idea can be extended to regions in the x y-plane, using an
integral of a continuum of moments instead of a finite sum. The center of gravity of a planar
region is defined as the point such that any force along a line through that point produces no
rotation of the region about that line.9 There should thus be zero torque in both the x and y
directions, so the idea is to apply formula (8.17) in both directions to obtain the region's center
of gravity (x¯, y¯).

 9For a proof that such a point exists, see p.206 in BROWN, F.L., Engineering Mechanics, 2nd ed., New York: John
Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1942. Some texts use the terms "center of mass" or "centroid" instead of "center of gravity," and
there are differences in the meanings. However, for the situation presented here, where the gravitational field is
assumed to have constant magnitude and direction throughout the region, they all mean the same thing.

   A region can be thought of as a lamina--a thin plate with uniform density. Take the area of

the region as its mass, which makes sense given the uniform density. For the region between

two curves y = f1(x) and y = f2(x) over [a, b], with f1(x)  f2(x), take a vertical slice of width
dx at some x, as in Figure 8.5.2(a). By the same arguments used in Section 8.4, all the area

from that strip comes from the rectangle of height f1(x) - f2(x) and width dx (see the shaded
rectangle in Figure 8.5.2(b)).

By the assumption of uniform density, the center of gravity of that rectangle is clearly its
                                                                                          1 dx,     21 ( f1(x) +

can be treated as if it is concentrated at that point. The moment mx of the strip about the

x-axis is its mass times the position of its center of gravity relative to the x-axis (i.e. its y

coordinate):

                 mx       =  (  f  1  (  x)  -     f  2  (  x))  dx    ·  (  1  (  f  1(  x)  +  f  2  (  x)))  =  1  ((  f  1  (  x))2  -     (  f  2  (  x))2  )  dx

Similarly the moment m y of the strip about the y-axis is its mass times the x coordinate of its
center of gravity:

my            =     (  f  1(x)  -  f  2(x))        dx       ·  (x   +  1  dx)         =   x ( f1(x) - f2(x)) dx                 +     1  (  f  1(x)     -  f  2  (x))   (dx)2
                                                                       2                                                              2

              = x ( f1(x) - f2(x)) dx

The moments Mx and My of the entire region about the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, are
defined as the sum of the respective moments mx and m y of all strips over [a, b]:

              b                    b     1  ((        (  x))2       (        (  x))2  )       and                         b                        b    x ( f1(x) - f2(x)) dx

Work

   Suppose that a constant force displaces an object along a line in the same direction in which
the force is applied. The work done by the force is defined as the force times the displacement.
For example, if the constant force F moves an object from position x = a to x = b on the x-axis,
as in Figure 8.5.3(a), then the work W done by the force is:

        W = force × displacement = force × (final position - initial position) = F · (b - a)

                                                                                                    F(x + dx)

                                                                                                 dx

                                                                                (b) Variable force F over [x, x + dx]
                           (a) Constant force F

           Figure 8.5.3 Work W as the effect of a force F displacing an object from x = a to x = b

Suppose now that the force F is a function of position x over [a, b]: F = F(x). By the Micros-

traightness Property, over an infinitesimal interval [x, x + dx] the curve y = F(x) is a straight

line, as in Figure 8.5.3(b). How should the work dW performed by F over this infinitesimal in-

terval be defined? After all, F is not constant over [x, x+dx]--it takes every value between F(x)

and F(x + dx). It is left as an exercise to show that any value in that range can be used--they
all result in the same amount F(x) dx for the work performed.10

For example, suppose you use the value halfway between F(x) and F(x + dx) as the value of
    1
F:  2  (F  (  x)  +  F  (  x  +  dx)).  Then  the  work  dW  as    force  times  displacement  is:

                                 dW = 1 (F(x) + F(x + dx)) dx = 1 (F(x) + F(x) + F(x) dx) dx
                                        2                                 2

                                                   1   2 0
                                 = F(x) dx + F (x)(dx)

                                                   2

                                 = F(x) dx

Define the total work W over [a, b] as the sum of all the dW:

The work performed by a force F(x) in displacing an object along the x-axis from x = a to

x = b is:                                                    b               b

                                                   W = dW = F(x) dx                                            (8.19)

10Note how this is different than claiming that F is "essentially constant over small intervals," as most textbooks
do. Instead, the additional infinitesimal force beyond F(x) contributes zero work over [x, x + dx].

   Before continuing, some possible confusion needs to be cleared up. First, force is always a
vector--it has both a magnitude and a direction. For the forces considered here, which act in
a single dimension (e.g. along the x-axis), by convention the direction of the force is indicated
by its sign: positive in the direction toward +, negative in the direction toward -. So a
force of 3 N acts in the opposite direction as a force of -3 N, but they have the same magnitude
|3| = 3.

   Second, work is not a vector--it is a scalar, meaning it has a magnitude but no direction.
That magnitude can have any sign, though. Work is positive if the object is displaced in the
same direction as the force, but is negative if the displacement is in the opposite direction of
the force. For example, if you lift an object straight up from the ground, then you did positive
work--the object moved in the same direction as the force you used. However, the force of
gravity did negative work on the object as you lifted, since gravity works downward yet the
object moved upward.

   Last, zero work is done by a force if no displacement in its direction oc-           N
curs. In particular, forces acting perpendicular to the line of displacement Fµ                 F
perform no work. For example, consider an object of mass m on a flat hori-

zontal table top as in the figure on the right. If you push that object to the

right with a force F (performing positive work), then both the downward                 -mg

force of gravity -mg and the upward normal force N exerted by the table

perform zero work on the object. The force of friction Fµ from the table surface does negative

work, as it opposes the force F. As an another example, no work is performed by holding a 100

lb object still and above the ground.

Example 8.26

Hooke's law states that a coiled spring has an elastic restoring force          compress stretch
F = -kx, where x is the displacement of the end of the spring from
its equilibrium position as the spring is stretched or compressed,                                     x
and k > 0 is the spring constant--or stiffness coefficient--specific to                      0
the spring. This force always tries to restore the spring to its equi-
librium position, and the law holds only for a limited range of x.
For a spring laid horizontally imagine it lies on the x-axis with the
equilibrium position at x = 0, as in the figure on the right.

(a) Find the spring constant k if a force of 2 N stretches the spring by 4 cm.

(b) Use part (a) to find the work performed by compressing the spring 3 cm.

Solution: (a) The force required to stretch the spring by an amount x is F = kx, since that force must
                                                     2N        2N
counter  the  restoring  force.  Thus,  k  =  F   =  4cm  =  0.04m  = 50  N/m.
                                              x
(b) By part (a) the force required to compress the string to position x is F(x) = kx = 50x, since again it

must counter the restoring force. Thus, since 3 cm is 0.03 m, the work W performed is:

               -0.03                       -0.03  50x dx = 25x2     -0.03  = 25 (-0.03)2 - 0 = 0.0225 Nm

Probability

Suppose you flip two evenly balanced pennies and let X be the number of heads in the result.

Then X is a discrete random variable--discrete because it can take only a discrete set of

values (0, 1 and 2); random because its value is left to chance. The probability of a penny
                                         1
being  flipped         heads  is  50% =      i.e.  that  is  its  theoretical  likelihood  since  heads     and  tails  are
                                         2,
equally likely. The sample space S of all possible outcomes is the set S = {TT, T H, HT, HH},

where H is heads and T is tails (e.g. HT means the first penny came up heads and the second

came up tails). Figure 8.5.4(a) shows a bar chart of the probabilities--as numbers between

0 and 1--with P(X = x) denoting the probability of the event that X equals the number x.

Notice that the sum of the probabilities is 1, and P(X = x) = 0 if x is not 0, 1, or 2.

                       P(X = x)                                                f (x)

                       Figure 8.5.4 Probability: discrete vs continuous random variables

   The idea behind a continuous random variable X is to fill in those gaps between the
bars in Figure 8.5.4(a), so that X would represent a continuous quantity, e.g. time, distance,
temperature. Rather than finding P(X = x) you would find the probability that X is in a
continuum such as an interval, e.g. P(a < X < b) (see Figure 8.5.4(b)).

For a continuous random variable X define P(X = x) = 0 for all real x, and define the

probability density function for X as a function f (x)  0 such that:

          f (x) dx = 1

(a)

       -

                                        b

(b) P(a < X < b) = f (x) dx for all a < b (including a = - and b = )

                                       a

   Notice that since P(X = a) = 0 then P(a  X < b) = P(a < X < b). In general, < and  are
interchangeable for events involving continuous random variables (as well as > and ). In
the remainder of this section it will be assumed that all random variables are continuous, for
which the sample space is typically all of R or some interval, finite or infinite (e.g. (0, )).

component is 700 days, then the probability density function f (x) for the random variable X is

                                              f (x) =     e-x     if x  0,                                    (8.20)
                                                         0        if x < 0

where  =   1     and  x  is  the  number  of  days.  In  this  case  X  is  said  to  have  the  exponential  distribution
          700
with parameter . Find the probability that the lifetime of the component is:

(a) between 600 and 800 days

(b) greater than 700 days

Solution: (a) The probability is:

    P(600 < X < 800) =        800             800      1 e- 700 dx = -e- 700xx    - 800 800 - 600              0.1055

                                  f (x) dx =  600 700                                  = -e 700 + e 700

                             600                                                  600

Thus, there is about a 10.55% chance that the component's lifetime will be between 600 and 800 days.
(b) The probability is:

          P(X > 700) =                                 1 e- 700 dx = -e- 700xx    

                                 f (x) dx =   700 700                                  = 0 + e-1  0.3679

                             700                                                  700

17. A random variable X is said to have a normal distribution if its probability density function f (x) is

                                                        1  (x-µ)2
                                           f (x) =  2 e 22            for all x

21. This exercise is related to Einstein's famous law E = mc2. The relativistic momentum p of a particle
    of mass m moving at a speed v along a straight line (say, the x-axis) is

                                        p=    mv ,
                                              1 - vc22

where c is the speed of light. The relativistic force on the particle along that line is

                                              F = dp ,
                                                      dt

which is the same formula as Newton's Second Law of motion in classical mechanics. Assume that

the particle starts at rest at position x1 and ends at position x2 along the x-axis. The work done by

the force F on the particle is:          x2                x2 dp

(a) Show that

                                        dp        m2 3/2 .

                                                      1 - cv22

So by part (d), K = E - mc2. Show that

          Infinite Sequences and Series

9.1 Sequences and Series

In the 5th century B.C. the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea devised several paradoxes,
the most famous of which--The Dichotomy--asserts that if space is infinitely divisible then
motion is impossible. The argument goes like this: imagine a line segment of finite length, say
1 m, with a person at one end as in Figure 9.1.1.

                       0 ... 1     1                   1                       1
                                8  4                   2

                                Figure 9.1.1 Zeno's motion paradox

Before traversing the entire distance the person would first need to travel one half the dis-

tance. Before doing that, though, he would need to travel one fourth the distance, and before

that one eighth the distance, and so on. There is thus no "first" distance for him to traverse,

meaning his motion cannot even begin!

Obviously motion is possible, or you would not be reading this. Does that mean Zeno's

reasoning is flawed? More on that later. In the meantime, notice a few things in Figure 9.1.1.
                                1, 1, 1,...
First,  the  distance  markers               form  an  infinite  sequence  of  numbers  approaching
                                248
0. Second, the sum of the distances between successive markers is an infinite series which

should equal the total segment length 1:

                                   1 + 1 + 1 + ··· = 1
                                   248

It will be shown shortly that the sum is indeed 1, which turns out to have no bearing on Zeno's
paradox. First some definitions are needed.

                                                        Sequences and Series · Section 9.1 287

   A sequence is an ordered list of objects, which in this book will always be real numbers.
Sequences can be finite or infinite: finite if there is a last number in the list, infinite if every
number in the list is followed by another number (i.e. a "successor"). Sequences should not be
confused with sets--order matters in a sequence but not in a set, and numbers may repeat in
a sequence but not in a set.

   For example, the sequences 1, 2, 3 and 1, 3, 2 are different, since order matters. However,
the numbers in those sequences comprise the same set {1, 2, 3}.

   The simplest example of an infinite sequence is N, the set of natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ..
In fact, the numbers a0, a1, a2, . . . in any infinite sequence of real numbers can be written as
the range of a function f mapping N into R:

                                                        f (n) = an         (9.1)

Typically notation such as { an }n=  0 is used for representing an infinite sequence, or simply
{ an } when the initial value of the index n is understood (and n is always an integer). The
intuitive notion of the limit of an infinite sequence can be stated formally:

A real number L is the limit of an infinite sequence { an }, written as

                                       lim an = L or simply an  L ,

                                                   n

if for any given number  > 0 there exists an integer N such that

                                             an - L <  for all n > N .     (9.2)

In this case the sequence { an } is said to converge to L and is called a convergent se-
quence. A sequence that is not convergent is divergent.

   In other words, a sequence { an } converges to L if the terms an can be made arbitrarily close
to L for n sufficiently large. In most cases the formal definition will not be needed, since by

formula (9.1) the same rules and formulas from Chapters 1 and 3 for the limit of a function

f (x) as x approaches  apply to sequences (e.g. sums and products of limits, L'Hôpital's Rule).
All you have to do is replace x by n.

Example 9.1

For  integers  n    1  define  an  =  1   .  Find  lim  an if it exists.
                                      2n           n

Solution: Since lim x1 = 0 then replacing x by n shows that
                      x 2

                                                   lim an = lim n 1 = 0 .
                                                   n    n 2
288 Chapter 9 · Infinite Sequences and Series                                                                                  §9.1

Example 9.2

For  integers  n    0  define  an  =  2n+1    Is  {   an  }  a  convergent  sequence?  If  so  then  find  its  limit.

                                      3n+2 .

Solution: By L'Hôpital's Rule, treating an integer n  0 as a real-valued variable x,

                                         lim an = lim 2n + 1 = lim 2 = 2 .
                                         n                n 3n + 2 n 3 3

Thus   the  sequence   is  convergent       and   its  limit    is  2.

                                                                    3

Example 9.3

For integers n  0 define an = 3n+ e 2 n . Is { an } a convergent sequence? If so then find its limit.
Solution: By L'Hôpital's Rule, treating an integer n  0 as a real-valued variable x,

                                         lim an = lim e = n lim e =  n
                                         n                n 3n + 2 n 3

Thus the sequence is divergent.

Example 9.4
The famous Fibonacci sequence1 { Fn } starts with the numbers 0 and 1, then each successive term is
the sum of the previous two terms: F0 = 0, F1 = 1,

                                            Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for integers n  2                                                 (9.3)

Equation (9.3) is a recurrence relation. The first ten Fibonacci numbers are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34.
Clearly { Fn } is a divergent sequence, since Fn  . For n  2 define an = Fn/Fn-1. The first few values
are:

a2 = F2 F1 = 11 = 1 , a3 = F3 F2 = 21 = 2 , a4 = F4 F3 = 32 = 1.5 , a5 = F5 F4 = 53  1.667

Show that { an } is convergent. In other words, in the Fibonacci sequence the ratios of each term to the
previous term converge to some number.

Solution: There are many ways to prove this, perhaps the simplest being to assume the sequence is
convergent and then find the limit (which would be impossible if the sequence were divergent). So
assume that an  a for some real number a. Then divide both sides of formula (9.3) by Fn-1, so that

                           Fn = 1 + Fn-2  an = 1 + 1 for integers n  2
                           Fn-1             Fn-1                               an-1

Now take the limit of both sides of the last equation as n  :

   An infinite series is the sum of an infinite sequence. If the infinite sequence is { an }n=  0
then the series can be written as

                                                        

                                              an = a0 + a1 + a2 +··· + an +···

                                                       n=0

or simply as an when the initial value of the index n is understood. There is a natural way
to define the sum of such a series:

                                                        

The sum of an infinite series an is

                                                      n=0

                                                                                            (9.4)

                                  an = lim sn

                              n=0 n

where { sn }n=  0 is the sequence of partial sums of the series:

               n                                           for n  0

   sn = ak = a0 + a1 + a2 +··· + an

             k=0

If the partial sums { sn } converge to a real number s then the series is convergent, and
converges to s; if { sn } diverges then the series is divergent.

One important convergent series is a geometric progression:

                           a + ar + ar2 + ar3 +··· + arn +···                                          (9.5)

with a = 0 and |r | < 1. Multiply the n-th partial sum sn by r:
      rsn = r (a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · + arn-1 + arn) = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + · · · + arn + arn+1

Now subtract rsn from sn:

sn - rsn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · + arn - (ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4 + · · · + arn + arn+1)

sn - rsn = a - arn+1 so that

lim sn = lim a (1 - r = n+1) a
n  n 1 - r                    1-r

since rn+1  0 as n   when |r | < 1. Thus:

                                                                                        

For a = 0 and |r | < 1 the geometric progression arn is convergent:

                                                                                      n=0

    arn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 +··· + arn +··· = a                                            (9.6)
                                                                  1-r

Back to Zeno's motion paradox, by Example 9.5 the sum of the infinite number of distances

between successive markers in Figure 9.1.1 is 1, as expected. This fact is often mistaken as

proof that Zeno was wrong, yet it does not actually address Zeno's argument, since the person

is attempting to begin motion at the tail end--the "infinite end"--of the geometric progression,

not at the beginning (i.e. at n = 0). Zeno's point remains that there is no "first step" at that tail

end.

In fact, even if you were to reverse the person's position to start at the other end, so that
                                         1                         1
he  would  first  move    a  distance        then  a     distance       and     so  on,  as  in  Figure    9.1.2,  then   a  new
                                         2,                        4,
problem is introduced: the person keeps moving no matter how close he is to the end point.

There is now no "last step" and motion is thus still impossible.

                                  Figure 9.1.2 Zeno's motion paradox in reverse

   The convergence of the geometric progression has misled many people to argue that Zeno
is wrong, by claiming it shows an infinite number of movements can be completed in a finite
amount of time. But this line of argument fails on (at least) two counts. First, Zeno never
argued about time--it is irrelevant to his paradox. The more fundamental flaw is that the
introduction of time brings along the concept of speed, typically taken to be constant (though it
need not be). Speed is distance over time, but it is precisely the distance part of that ratio that
Zeno rejects--that distance can never be traveled. In other words, it is circular--and hence
faulty--reasoning to "prove" that motion is possible by assuming it is possible.

   The geometric progression also doesn't help when considering only the distances and ignor-
ing time. Even assuming each of those distances could be traveled, the partial sums approach
1 but never actually reach it. The limit of a sequence is defined in terms of an inequality--you
can get arbitrarily close to the limit, and that is all. The equality in formula (9.6) is merely
a shorthand way of saying that. It is an abstraction based on properties of the real number
system, not necessarily based on physical reality.

   Zeno's paradox is not purely mathematical--it is about space and hence is physical, with a
tinge of philosophy. Physicists have recognized this--and noted the flaw in the purely math-
ematical line of attack--and devised new arguments against Zeno, some more sophisticated
than others. However, they all invariably end up in some sort of circular reasoning. All this
calls into question the original assumption: the infinite divisibility of space. If space had some
smallest unit that could not be divided any further then there is no paradox--motion over a
finite distance could always be decomposed into a large but finite number of irreducible steps.3

 3As of this writing there is not yet a definitive answer as to whether space is continuous or discrete (quantized).
A "smallest unit" would have to be below the Planck level--around 10-33 cm, well below current measurement
capabilities. Some recent advances in the field of loop quantum gravity suggest the possibility of quantized space.

9.2 Tests for Convergence

There are many ways to determine if a sequence converges--two are listed below. In all cases
changing or removing a finite number of terms in a sequence does not affect its convergence or
divergence:

1. Monotone Bounded Test: A sequence that is bounded and monotone--i.e. either
    always increasing or always decreasing--is convergent.

2. Comparison Test: If { bn } diverges to  and if { an } is a sequence such that an  bn
    for all n > N for some N, then { an } also diverges to .
    Likewise, if { cn } diverges to - and an  cn for all n > N for some N, then { an } also
    diverges to -.

The Comparison Test makes sense intuitively, since something                                            x
larger than a quantity going to infinity must also go to infinity.  a1 a2 a3 a4 ···  M

The Monotone Bounded Test can be understood by thinking of          Figure 9.2.1
a bound on a sequence as a wall that the sequence can never

pass, as in Figure 9.2.1. The increasing sequence { an } in the figure moves toward M but can

never pass it. The sequence thus cannot diverge to , and it cannot fluctuate back and forth
since it always increases. Thus it must converge somewhere before or at M.4 Notice that the

Monotone Bounded Test tells you only that the sequence converges, not what it converges to.

Example 9.7

Show that the sequence { an }n=  1 defined for n  1 by
                                                       an = 1 · 3 · 5 · · · (2n - 1) 2 · 4 · 6 · · · (2n)

is convergent.
Solution: Notice that { an } is always decreasing, since

                         an+1 = 1 · 3 · 5 · · · (2n - 1) · (2n + 1) 2 · 4 · 6 · · · (2n) · (2n + 2) = an · 2n + 1 2n + 2 < an · (1) = an

for n  1. The sequence is also bounded, since 0 < an and

                                            an = 12 · 34 · 56 · · · 2n - 1 2n < 1 for n  1
since each fraction in the above product is less than 1. Thus, by the Monotone Bounded Test the
sequence is convergent.
Note that for a decreasing sequence only the lower bound is needed for the Monotone Bounded Test, not
the upper bound. Similarly, for an increasing sequence only the upper bound matters.

Some tests for convergence of a series are listed below:

1. n-th Term Test: If an converges then lim an = 0.

                                                                                n

2. Ratio Test: For a series an of positive terms let

R = lim an+1 .
       n an

    Then
    (a) if R < 1 then the series converges,
    (b) if R > 1 (including R = ) then the series diverges,
    (c) if R = 1 then the test fails.

                                                           

3. Integral Test: For a series an of positive terms let f (x) be a decreasing function on

                                                         n=1

    [1, ) such that f (n) = an for all integers n  1. Then

                                       and   

    an                                          f (x) dx

n=1                                         1

either both converge or both diverge.

4. p-series Test: The series n=1 np  1 converges for p > 1, and diverges for p  1.

5. Comparison Test: If 0  an  bn for n > N for some N, and if bn is convergent
    then an is convergent. Similarly, if 0  bn  an for n > N for some N, and if bn is
    divergent then an is divergent.

6. Limit Comparison Test: For two series an and bn of positive terms let

L = lim an .
       n bn

Then
(a) if 0 < L <  then an and bn either both converge or both diverge,
(b) if L = 0 and bn converges then an converges,
(c) if L =  and bn diverges then an diverges.

7. Telescoping Series Test: Suppose an = (bn - bn+1) for some sequence { bn }. Then
       an converges if and only if bn  L, in which case an = b1 - L.
                                                          Tests for Convergence · Section 9.2 295

Most of the above tests have fairly short proofs or at least intuitive explanations. For exam-

ple, the n-th Term Test follows from the definition of convergence of a series: if an converges

to a number L then since each term an = sn - sn-1 is the difference of successive partial sums,

taking the limit yields

                             lim an = lim (sn - sn-1) = L - L = 0
                             n                  n

by definition of the convergence of a series.
Since the n-th Term Test can never be used to prove convergence of a series, it is often stated
in the following logically equivalent manner:

n-th Term Test: If lim an = 0 then an diverges.

                                    n

Example 9.8

Show that = + + + · · ·  n 1 2 3 is divergent.
                n=1 2n + 1 3 5 7

Solution: Since                                 lim n = 1 = 0
                                                n 2n + 1 2

then by the n-th Term Test the series diverges.

   The Ratio Test takes a bit more effort to prove.5 When the ratio R in the Ratio Test is larger
than 1 then that means the terms in the series do not approach 0, and thus the series diverges
by the n-th Term Test. When R = 1 the test fails, meaning it is inconclusive--another test
would need to be used. When the test shows convergence it does not tell you what the series
converges to, merely that it converges.

Example 9.9

Determine if n=1 2n  n is convergent.

Solution:  For  the  series  general  term  an  =  n   ,
                                                   2n

                                                          n+1

                             R = lim an+1       = lim 2 nn+1    = lim n + 1 = 1 < 1 ,
                                    n an                        n 2n  2
                                                    n

                                                            2n

so by the Ratio Test the series converges.

In Figure 9.2.2(a) the area 1 f (x) dx is greater than the total area S of all the rectangles
under the curve. Since each rectangle has height an and width 1, then S =                                         an.  Thus,  since
                                                                                                               2
removing the single term a1 from the series does not affect the convergence or divergence of

the series, the series converges if the improper integral converges, and conversely the integral

                                                                                                    
diverges if the series diverges. Similarly, in Figure 9.2.2(b) the area 1 f (x) dx is less than the
total area S =               of  all  the    rectangles,  so      the  integral  converges      if  the  series   converges,         and
                     1  an

the series diverges if the integral diverges. Notice how in both graphs the rectangles are either

all below the curve or all protrude above the curve due to f (x) being a decreasing function.

Show that the p-series n=1 np  1 converges for p > 1 and diverges for p = 1.

Solution:  For  p1      let  f (x) =  1    on  [1, ).    Then     f (x) is  decreasing,  and    f (n) = an =   1   for all  integers
                                      xp                                                                       np

                    f (x) dx =      1 xp ( p - 1) x 1

                1

so the integral converges. Thus, by the Integral Test, the series converges for p > 1. For p = 1,

                                                                   dx  = ln x = 
                                                                  1x

                                             1

so the integral diverges. So by the Integral Test, the series diverges for p = 1. The harmonic series

                                                  =  1 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · ·

thus  diverges  even  though     an   =   1    0  (which  is  hence    not  a  sufficient  condition   for  a  series  to  converge).
                                          n

Note that this example partly proves the p-series Test. The remaining case (p < 1) is left as an exercise.

   The divergence part of the Comparison Test is clear enough to understand, but for the con-

vergence part with 0  an  bn for all n larger than some N, ignore the (finite) number of terms
before aN and bN. Since bn converges then its partial sums must be bounded. The partial
sums for an then must also be bounded, since 0  an  bn for n > N. So since an  0 means
that the partial sums for an are increasing, by the Monotone Bounded Test the partial sums
for an must converge, i.e. an is convergent.

Example 9.11

Determine if n=1 nn  1 is convergent.
Solution: Since nn  n2 > 0 for n > 2, then

                                                   0 < nn 1  n2 1

for n > 2. Thus, since       1       converges    (by  the                                        p-series Test  with  p = 2 > 1,  as in  Example  9.10),  the

by the Comparison test. Likewise,

by the Comparison Test again. The cases L = 0 and L =  are handled similarly.

A series an is telescoping if an = bn - bn+1 for some sequence { bn }. Assume the series
an and sequence { bn } both start at n = 1. Then the partial sum sn for an is

     sn = a1 + a2 + · · · + an = (b1 - b2) + (b2 - b3) + · · · + (bn - bn+1) = b1 - bn+1

for n  1. Thus, since b1 is a fixed number, limn sn exists if and only if limn bn+1 exists,
i.e. an converges if and only if { bn } converges. So if bn  L then sn  b - L, i.e. an
converges to L, which proves the Telescoping Series Test. Note that the number b1, as the first
number in the sequence { bn }, could be replaced by whatever the first number is, in case the
index n starts at a number different from 1.

Example 9.13

Determine if  1 is convergent. If it converges then can you find its sum?
                   n=1 n (n + 1)

Solution:  For  the  sequence  { bn  }                 with  bn  =  1  for  n  1,  each  term  in  the  series  can  be  written  as
                                                                    n

                                                       1               1    1

Thus, since { bn } converges to 0, by the Telescoping Series Test the series also converges, to b1 - 0 = 1.

Convergent series have the following properties (based on similar properties of limits):

  Let an and bn be convergent series, and let c be a number. Then:
  (a) (an ± bn) is convergent, with (an ± bn) = an ± bn
  (b) can is convergent, with can = c · an

(b) The textbook Applied Mathematics for Physical Chemistry (3rd ed.), J. Barrante, provides the

     where the series on the left converges (by the p-series Test with p = 2) and the series on the right
     diverges (by the p-series Test with p = 1), and since each term in the middle series is between
     its corresponding terms in the left series and right series, then there must be a p-series for some

     value 1 < p < 2 such that each term in the middle series is less than the corresponding term in
     that p-series. That is,

            1 + 14 + 19 + 116 + · · · < 1 + 13 + 15 + 17 + · · · < 1 + 2p 1 + 3p 1 + 4p 1 + · · ·

          for that value of p between 1 and 2. But p > 1 for that p-series on the right, so it converges,
          which means that the middle series converges! Find and explain the flaw in this argument.

9.3 Alternating Series

In the last section the harmonic series

                                        =  1 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · ·
                                   n=1 n                                2345

was shown to diverge. If you were to alternate the signs of successive terms, as in

                                   =  (-1)n-1 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - · · ·                                                           (9.7)
                                   n=1 n                                    2345

then it turns out that this new series--called an alternating series--converges, due to the
following test:

Alternating Series Test: If an is an alternating series--i.e. the signs of the terms an
alternate between positive and negative--such that the absolute values of the terms are

decreasing to 0, then the series converges.

The condition for the test means that |an+1|  |an | for all n and |an |  0 as n  . To see why
the test works, consider the alternating series given above by formula (9.7), with an = n -1n-1 .
The odd-numbered partial sums s1, s3, s5, . . ., can be written as

                 s1 = 1 , s3 = 1 - 12 - 13                              , s5 = 1 - 12 - 13 - 14 - 15                , ...

                                                              >0                            >0                >0

while the even-numbered partial sums s2, s4, s6, . . ., can be written as

      s2 = 1 - 12 , s4 = 1 - 12 + 13 - 14                                   , s6 = 1 - 12 + 13 - 14 + 15 - 16              , ...

                                                                    >0                               >0             >0

Thus the odd-numbered partial sums { s2n-1 } are decreasing from s1 = 1, and the even-numbered
                                                 1                      1,        1
ones  {  s2n  }  are  increasing  from  s2  =1-  2                =         with  2  <  sn  <1  for  all  n,  i.e.  the  partial  sums  are
                                                                        2
bounded. So by the Monotone Bounded Test, both sequences { s2n-1 } and { s2n } must converge.
                               -1
Since    s2n - s2n-1 = a2n  =  2n  for  all  n  1,                then

                      lim (s2n - s2n-1) = lim -1 = 0  lim s2n = lim s2n+1
                      n                      n 2n                                       n                 n

Thus, the partial sums sn have a common limit, so the series converges. Notice that the key to
the convergence was having the terms decreasing in absolute value to zero.

Example 9.14
Determine if  (-1)n is convergent.

                   n=2 ln n

                                                                   (-1)n

Solution: For the general term an = ln n , since ln (n + 1) > ln n for n  2 and ln n   as n  , then
|an | decreases to 0 as n  . Thus, by the Alternating Series Test the series converges.

   The series n=  1 n (-1)n-1 converges by the Alternating Series Test, though the series  1
diverges. This makes n=  1 n (-1)n-1 an example of a conditionally convergent series:      n=1 n

A series an is conditionally convergent if an converges but |an | diverges. If |an |
converges then an is absolutely convergent.

               (-1)n-1                                            1
For example, n=1 n is not absolutely convergent, since n=1 n diverges.

Example 9.15

Is 2  (-1)n-1 conditionally convergent or absolutely convergent?
    n=1 n

              1          (-1)n-1
Solution: Since n=1 n2 converges (by the p-series Test) then n=1 n2 is absolutely convergent.

   It turns out that absolute convergence implies ordinary convergence:

  Absolute Convergence Test: If |an | converges then an converges.

   The test is obvious if the terms an are all positive, so assume the series has both positive
terms (denoted by the sequence apos ) and negative terms (denoted by aneg ). Then the
series can be decomposed into the difference of two series:

                                                  an = apos - |aneg |

Since each of the sums on the right side of the equation is part of the convergent series |an |,
then each sum itself converges (being part of a finite sum). Thus their difference, namely an,
is finite, i.e. an converges.

   The test can be stated in the following logically equivalent manner:

  Absolute Convergence Test: If an diverges then |an | diverges.
302 Chapter 9 · Infinite Sequences and Series                                 §9.3

   One unusual feature of a conditionally convergent series is that its terms can be rearranged
to converge to any number, a result known as Riemann's Rearrangement Theorem. For
example, the alternating harmonic series

                                                1 - 12 + 13 - 14 + 15 - · · ·

consists of one divergent series of positive terms subtracted from another series of positive
terms, namely:

         1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ··· = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ··· - 1 + 1 + 1 + ···
              2345               357            246

The idea is that since the first series on the right diverges then that series has some partial
sum that could be made just larger than any positive number A. Likewise, since the second
series on the right that is being subtracted also diverges, it has some partial sum that when
subtracted from the first partial sum results in a number just less than A. Continue like this
indefinitely, first adding a partial sum to get a number just bigger than A then subtracting
another partial sum to get just less than A. Since the terms in each series approach zero, the
overall series can be made to converge to A! It also turns out that an absolutely convergent
series does not have this feature--any rearrangement of terms results in the same sum.7

9.4 Power Series

A power series is an infinite series whose terms involve constants an and powers of x - c,
where x is a variable and c is a constant: an (x - c)n. In many cases c will be 0. For example,
the geometric progression

                        r =  n 1 + r + r2 + r3 + · · · = 1
                                                                 1-r
                        n=0

converges when |r | < 1, i.e. for -1 < r < 1, as shown in Section 9.1. Replacing the constant r by
a variable x yields the power series

                        x =  n 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · = 1                                           (9.8)
                                                                 1-x
                        n=0

that converges to   1   when -1 < x < 1.  Note that the series diverges for |x|  1,             by the n-th
                   1-x
Term Test.

In general a power series of the form fn(x), where fn(x) = an(x - c)n is a sequence of func-

tions, has an interval of convergence defined as the set of all x such that the series con-

verges. The interval can be any combination of open or closed, as well as the extreme cases

of a single point or all real numbers. On its interval of convergence the power series is thus a

function of x. The radius of convergence R of a power series is defined as half the length of

the interval of convergence. In the case where the interval of convergence is all of R you would

say R = .

For example, for the above power series        f n ( x),  where  f n ( x)  =  xn  for  n    0,  the  interval  of
                                          n=0
convergence is -1 < x < 1, so the radius of convergence is R = 1. Notice that

                                               for -1 < x < 1

                             f (x) = xn

                                          n=0

is thus a well-defined function on the interval (-1, 1), where it happens to equal 1-x 1 . This
power series can be thought of as a polynomial of infinite degree.

   To find the interval of convergence of a power series fn(x), you typically would use the
Ratio Test on the absolute values of the terms (since the Ratio Test requires positive terms):

                             r(x) = lim fn+1(x)                                                      (9.9)
                                       n fn(x)

Note that the limit r(x) in this case is a function of x. When taking the limit, though, treat x
as fixed. By the Ratio Test the power series will then converge for all x such that r(x) < 1, and
diverge when r(x) > 1. When r(x) = 1 the test is inconclusive, so you would have to check those
cases individually to see if those values of x should be added to the interval of convergence
(along with the points where r(x) < 1).

Solution: For fn(x) = nx !n ,

r(x) = lim fn+1(x)            = lim n xn+1/(n + 1) !  = |x| · lim 1                                   = |x| · 0 = 0

for any fixed x. Thus, r(x) = 0 < 1 for all x, so the interval of convergence is all of R, i.e. - < x < .

                                                                         n=1 n

Solution: For fn(x) = nxn ,

r(x) = lim fn+1(x)  = lim n xn+1/(n + 1)  = lim nx                                                    = |x| · lim n      = |x| · 1 = |x|
          n fn(x)          n  x /n           n n + 1                                                            n n + 1

for any fixed x. Thus, the series converges when r(x) = |x| < 1 and diverges when r(x) = |x| > 1.
                                                                                                                         1n ,
The cases r(x) = |x| = 1 need to be checked individually. For x = 1 the series is                                              which  diverges.
                                                                                                      n=1
For x = -1 the series is n=1 n (-1)n-1 , which converges. Thus, the interval of convergence is -1  x < 1.

Example 9.18

                                                                                                   

Find the interval of convergence of the power series n ! xn .

                                                                                                 n=0

Solution: For fn(x) = n ! xn,

r(x) = lim fn+1(x)         = lim n (n + 1) ! xn+1     = |x| · lim |n + 1| =                           0 if x = 0,
          n fn(x)             n     n! x                                                               if x = 0.
                                                                   n

Thus, r(x) =  > 1 for all x = 0, so the series diverges for x = 0. So since r(x) = 0 < 1 only for x = 0, the
interval of convergence is the single point x = 0.

It turns out that power series can be both differentiated and integrated term by term:9

                                                 

For a power series f (x) = an (x - c)n that converges for |x - c| < R, both

                                               n=0

                                          f (x) dx = C +  an (x - c)n+1                                                               (9.10)
                                                               n=0 n + 1
f (x) = n an (x - c)n-1 and

              n=1

converge for |x - c| < R.

 9The proofs require uniform convergence, a stronger condition than ordinary convergence. See pp.129-134 in

   Notice that the above statement says nothing about the convergence of f (x) or f (x) dx at
the endpoints of the interval |x - c| < R. In each case convergence at the endpoints can be
checked individually.

Solution: Differentiate f (x) term by term:                              n=0

       f (x) = d                   = d (1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · ) = 0 + 1 + 2x + 3x2 + · · · = nx  n-1
                  dx                   dx
                               xn                                                                n=1

                          n=0

Since f (x) converges for -1 < x < 1 then so does f (x). Checking the endpoints, at x = 1 and x = -1 the

series for f (x) are           n  and
                          n=1
Thus, the interval of convergence for f (x) is-1 < x < 1.

Since  f (x) =   1   for  -1 < x < 1   then  f (x) =     1    for  -1 < x < 1.  Thus,

                                                                      (1 - x)2

Bessel Functions

   Many applications in engineering and physics--especially those involving oscillations or me-
chanical vibrations--require solving differential equations of the form

                                             2 d + + y = 2 y 1 dy 0 ,                                      (9.11)
                                             dx x dx

known as Bessel's equation. This equation has a solution J0(x), known as Bessel's function
of order zero,10 defined in terms of a power series:

                 J0(x) = (-1)n x2n = 1 - x2 + x4 - x6 + · · ·                                              (9.12)

The Ratio Test shows that J0(x) converges for all x, since for any fixed x,

       r(x) = lim                 (-1)n+1 x2n+2 ((n + 1) !)2 · 22n+2  = x2 · lim       1         = 0 < 1.

                                                                                n 4 (n + 1)

The general Bessel equation of order m,

                  2 d + + 2 y 1 dy 1 - 2 m y = 2 0                                                         (9.13)
                  dx x dx                             x

for m = 0, 1, 2, . . ., has a solution Jm(x), called Bessel's function of order m:

                 Jm(x) = (-1)n  1                         x 2n+m                                           (9.14)

                               n=0

For example, the Bessel function J1(x) of order 1 is

J1(x) = (-1)n  1               x 2n+1 x               x3  x5                                           x7

n=0           n ! · (n + 1) !

Term by term differentiation shows that J0 (x) = -J1(x):

                ddx (J0(x)) = ddx 1 - 22 x + 22 · 42 - 22 · 42 · 62 + 22 · 42 · 62 · 82 - · · · 2 x4 x6 x8
                               = - x2 + 22x· 4 - 22 · 42 · 6 + 22 · 42 · 62 · 8 - · · · = -J1 3 x5 x7 (x)

Graphs of J0(x) and J1(x) are shown in Figure 9.4.1 below. As you can see, J0(x) and J1(x)
behave as sort of "poor man's" cosine and sine functions, respectively.

9.5 Taylor's Series

In the previous section a few functions, e.g. f (x) = 1-x 1 , turned out to be the sum of a power
series. This section will discuss a general method for representing a function as a power series,
called a Taylor's series.11 Suppose that a function f (x) can be written as

                                                                                   

                                                   f (x) = an (x - c)n

                                                                                 n=0

either for all x or for |x - c| < R, for some R > 0. Then f (c) = a0, and differentiating term by
term yields

                                                                    f (c) = 1 · a1

f (x) = n an (x - c)n-1

              n=1

                                                                    f (c) = 2 · 1 · a2

f (x) = n (n - 1) an (x - c)n-2

These { an } are the Taylor's series coefficients of f (x) at x = c. The full power series repre-
sentation of f (x) can now be stated:

Taylor's formula: If f (x) has a power series representation in powers of x - c, where x = c

is inside the interval of convergence, then that representation is unique in that interval

and is given by           f (x) = f (n)(c) (x - c)n

for all x in the interval. This is the Taylor's series for f (x) about x = c.

Example 9.20

Find the Taylor's series for f (x) = ex about x = 0.

Solution:  Since  d   (ex) = ex,  then  for  all  n  0,
                  dx

                                        f (n)(x) = ex  f (n)(0) = e0 = 1 .

Thus, by Taylor's formula with c = 0:12

                                  ex  = f (n)(0) xn  = xn

For what x is this Taylor's series valid? Recall that Example 9.16 showed the interval of convergence is
all of R. Thus the above Taylor's series holds for all x.

   Before continuing, you might be wondering why you should even bother with finding the
Taylor's series--after all, in the above example why replace a simple function like ex by a far
more complicated expression? One reason is that it often helps simplify some computations,
especially in integrals. The idea is to use only a few terms in the series, i.e. a polynomial, as
an approximation, since polynomials are generally easier to work with. Perhaps surprisingly,
in many practical applications no more than two terms are needed, and often only one.

   For example, using only the first two terms of the Taylor's series for ex in Example 9.20,
ex  1 + x is a good approximation when x is close to 0 (i.e. |x|  1). Using more terms does not
necessarily help--for |x|  1 and n > 1, xn will be effectively 0. So the added complexity would
not make the approximation significantly better.

Example 9.21

The energy density E of electromagnetic radiation at wavelength  from a black-body at temperature
T degrees Kelvin is given by Planck's Law of black-body radiation,

                                                  E() = 8hc 5(ehc/kT - 1)

where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and k is Boltzmann's constant. Show that for   1:

                                                             E()  4 8kT
                                                                              

Solution: Since ex  1 + x for |x|  1 by the Taylor series for ex, let x = hc/kT. Then x  1 and so

                      E() = 8hc 5(ehc/kT - 1)  5               8hc               8hc 8kT
                                                              1 + hc kT - 1   5 hc  4

though that terminology is typically not used in fields of study outside mathematics.

Example 9.22

Find the Taylor's series for f (x) = sin x about x = 0.                           f (4)(x) = sin x
Solution: The derivatives of f (x) = sin x repeat every four derivatives:

        f (x) = sin x , f (x) = cos x , f (x) = - sin x , f (x) = - cos x ,

So at x = 0:                                                                      f (4)(x) = 0

              f (0) = 0 , f (x) = 1 , f (x) = 0 , f (x) = -1 ,

So for n  0,                                    
                                                 0
                                   f (n)(0) =  1       if n is even,
                                                       if n = 1,5,9,...,

Thus, by Taylor's formula with c = 0

                              sin x =   f (n)(0) n

By the Ratio Test this series converges for all x, since for any fixed x,

Example 9.23

Find the Taylor's series for f (x) = cos x about x = 0.

Solution: The Taylor's series can be found using the same procedure as in Example 9.22, but it is
simpler to just differentiate the Taylor's series for sin x term by term for all x:

              cos x = d (sin x) = d x - x + - + - · · · 3 x5 x7 x9
                              dx            dx            3! 5! 7! 9!

                              = (-1)n  x2n
                                       (2n)!
                              n=0

Since the Taylor's series for sin x converges for all x then so does its derivative. Thus the Taylor's series
for cos x converges for all x.
Notice that the Taylor's series for cos x has only even powers of x, while the series for sin x has only odd
powers of x. This makes sense since cos x and sin x are even and odd functions, respectively.

Example 9.24

The function ln x is not defined at x = 0 and hence has no Taylor's series about x = 0. Instead, find the
Taylor's series for f (x) = ln (1 + x) about x = 0.
Solution: Take successive derivatives:
f (x) = ln (1 + x) , f (x) = 1 1 + x , f (x) = - (1 + x)2 1 , f (x) = (1 + x)3 1 · 2 , f (4)(x) = - (1 + x)4 1 · 2 · 3
So f (0) = 0 and for n  1:

                                f (n)(x) = (-1) (1 + x)n n-1 (n - 1)!  f (n)(0) = (-1)n-1 (n - 1)!
Thus, by Taylor's formula,

 ln (1 + x) = f (n)(0) xn  = (-1)n-1 (n - 1)! xn
                n=0 n!                                        n!
                                                         n=1

                = (-1)n-  1 xn
                               n
                n=1

                          x2 x3 x4 x5
                = x - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - ···

Use the Ratio Test to find the interval of convergence:

r(x) = lim      (-1)n xn+1     = |x| · lim n                  = |x| · 1 = |x|
                        n+1              n n + 1
             n
                (-1)n-1 xn
                            n

So the series converges when |x| < 1. Check the cases r(x) = |x| = 1 individually. For x = 1 the series
is the alternating harmonic series n=1 n (-1)n-1 , which converges. For x = -1 the series is - n=1 n1 , the
negative of the harmonic series, which diverges. Thus, the series converges for -1 < x  1.

Example 9.25
Find the Taylor's series for f (x) = ex2 about x = 0.
Solution: The Taylor's series can be found using the same procedure as in Example 9.20, but it is simpler
to just replace each occurrence of x in the Taylor's series for ex by x2 (since the series for ex converges
for all x). In other words, make the substitution u = x2 in the Taylor's series for eu about u = 0:

eu  = un

ex2  = (x2)n  = x2n

for x in the interval of convergence for the full Taylor's series. In other words, Pn(x) is the
n-th partial sum of the Taylor's series. Since some of the coefficients could be zero, Pn(x) is a
polynomial of degree at most n. Thus, Pn(x) = O(xn). For that reason Pn(x) is sometimes called
the O(xn) approximation to f (x).

over the interval [-2, 2], with the O(x15) approximation still being fairly good over [-6, 6].
Clearly those approximations all become poor quite quickly for |x| > 6; they approach ±,
unlike sin x.

   The following theorem shows how to measure the accuracy of the approximations:

Remainder Theorem:13If Pn(x) is the n-th degree Taylor polynomial about x = c for a
function f (x) in some interval containing x = c, then for all x in that interval,

                             f (x) = Pn(x) + Rn(x) ,                                 (9.17)

where                        Rn(x) = f (n+1)(c + (x - c)) (n + 1)! (x - c)n+1

for some number  between 0 and 1. Alternatively,                                     (9.18)
                                                                                     (9.19)
                             Rn(x) = 1 x n! (x - t)n f (n+1)(t) dt . c

   Since the number  is unknown in equation (9.18), usually only an upper bound on the
remainder Rn(x) can be found by that formula. For practical purposes formula (9.19) for Rn(x)
might be easier to use (via numerical integration).

   A common misconception is that hand-held calculators use Taylor's series to compute values
of functions like sin x, cos x, ex, etc. However, that is typically well beyond their capability,
especially for large values of x--far too many terms would be required. Instead, many calcula-
tors use an algorithm called CORDIC14 (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer), and--perhaps
surprisingly--lookup tables. CORDIC uses the computationally inexpensive operation of bit-
shifting to translate large input values into a smaller range, then uses tables stored in memory
for values in that range, along with interpolation for numbers between those in the tables.15

     The exact value of the integral rounded to 3 decimal places is S = 53.226. Use the first two nonzero
     terms in the Taylor's series for 1 + 4x2 about x = 0 to approximate the integral. How close is this
     approximation to the actual value? Does the approximation become better if you use the first three

     nonzero terms in the Taylor's series? Justify your answer.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
                                               changing it is not allowed.

                                                    Preamble

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy
and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must
themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which
is a copyleft license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free
software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the
same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction
or reference.

                  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.
Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license
if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

                                                                                                                              321
322 GNU Free Documentation License

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a
portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another lan-
guage.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document
that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to
the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall di-
rectly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a mat-
ter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as
being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under
this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed
to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the
Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts
or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a
format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for
input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or
absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup,
Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD,
and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include
proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-
generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages
as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of
the text.

   The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the
public.
                                                            GNU Free Documentation License 323

   A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is
precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
"Acknowledgments", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the
Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Enti-
tled XYZ" according to this definition.

   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this
License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included
by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication
that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this
License.

                              2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncom-
mercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other con-
ditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies
you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly
display copies.

                            3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the
Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers
must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover
must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may
add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as
verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first
ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a com-
plete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option,
324 GNU Free Documentation License

you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated lo-
cation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well be-
fore redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
updated version of the Document.

                                  4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of
sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you
must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document,
    and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
    section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original
    publisher of that version gives permission.

B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship
    of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
    authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they
    release you from this requirement.

C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.

D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright
    notices.

F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permis-
    sion to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
    Addendum below.

G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts
    given in the Document's license notice.

H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at
    least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
    Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title,
    year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
    describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
                                                            GNU Free Documentation License 325

J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Trans-
    parent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document
    for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
    may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the
    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the
    section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
    acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their
    titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the
    Modified Version.

N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
    any Invariant Section.

O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as
Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option
designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from
any other section titles.

   You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorse-
ments of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or
that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a stan-
dard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to
25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.
Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting
on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission
from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to
use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

                          5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under
the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the
combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
326 GNU Free Documentation License

list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you
preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invari-
ant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if
known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original
documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
"Acknowledgments", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".

                     6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under
this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License
for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually
under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

          7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent docu-
ments or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate"
if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the com-
pilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in
an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not
themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,
then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on
printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

                                   8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the
Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations re-
quires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of
some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
                                                            GNU Free Documentation License 327

You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and
any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the
original version will prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgments", "Dedications", or "History",
the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
actual title.

                                   9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly pro-
vided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copy-
right holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the
copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time
you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who
have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated
and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
give you any rights to use it.

              10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Docu-
mentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.
org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document
specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it,
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies
that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

                                   11. RELICENSING
328 GNU Free Documentation License

   "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide Web
server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody
to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of copy-
rightable works thus published on the MMC site.

   "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by
Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business
in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by
that same organization.

   "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of
another Document.

   An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that
were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

   The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-
SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for
relicensing.

    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the
document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright © YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify
    this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or
    any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections,
    no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the
    section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with
. . . Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
    being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three,
merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing
these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General
Public License, to permit their use in free software.
