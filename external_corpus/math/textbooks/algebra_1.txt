Quick Start

Welcome to your Algebra 1 module! We're genuinely excited for you to join our community and embark on a
transformative learning journey!
This user-friendly guide is your roadmap to navigating the features and resources of our unique Algebra 1 content. Let's
raise the bar on your algebra skills--get started with confidence today!

I. Where to Start

Algebra 1 has nine units, each of which begins with a special lesson called Overview and Readiness. These lessons
provide a miniature review of the knowledge you need for the unit ahead. Completing these lessons will help you feel
confident in your ability to handle what comes next.
Units 4 and 6 also have inquiry projects, meant to revisit previous knowledge while introducing you to upcoming topics.
We recommend completing these alongside their respective Overview and Readiness lessons.

II. Unit Structure

                                                                                Image 1
After completing the Overview and Readiness lesson, you can progress through the regular Lessons.
Each Lesson has multiple pages to guide you through learning new skills and reinforcing old ones.
At the end of each unit, you will also find a Project and Wrap Up lesson covering the topics in the unit. Use these lessons
to cement understanding of the skills you just learned.

III. Lesson Structure

                                                                                Image 2
Lesson Activities
The first page of a lesson is called "Lesson Overview." Here you will find the different types of activities included in the

    lesson (Image 2).

      · Warm up: This is the first activity in a lesson.
      · Primary activities: These are unique and need extra focus. We'll take a close look at them in the next part of this

          guide.
      · Cool-down: This is the last activity in a lesson.
      · Practice: This is a practice page with problems on the topics you learned in the lesson.

    IV. Primary Activities

                                     Image 3  Image 4

    Primary Activities
    Here's an example of one of these unique types of activities. Each lesson has 2-3 of these.

    Some activities have a section called Are you ready for more? This section, meant to expand your thinking, is optional
    unless otherwise stated by your teacher (Image 3).

    After you have finished the activity, you will do a multiple choice question called a Self Check (Image 3). If you feel
    confident in your skills, you may move on to the next lesson.

    Additional Resources
    If you want a refresher on the skills tested in the Self Check, read through the Additional Resources section, then
    complete the Try It section to test yourself on what you've learned. This section is optional unless otherwise stated by

Using Desmos

Throughout the Algebra 1 curriculum, you will find Desmos activities and graphing calculators embedded in lessons.
Desmos activities are interactive online problem sets located on the Desmos website. They can be assigned to your
students and graded automatically if you have a Desmos account. Desmos graphing calculators are interactive online
graphs embedded under graphing problems in the Algebra 1 course. Note, the embedded calculator adheres to
instructional requirements, not assessment requirements.

We have created a how-to guide with helpful screenshots and links to help you and your students use Desmos. If you
need additional help, view the official Desmos guide (https://openstax.org/r/desmos-graphing).

         the correct equation you found in step 4 using the following tips:
          Notice that when you type the "1" after or , Desmos automatically places it as subscript.
          Also notice that we are not using an equal sign. The symbol ~ means approximately and tells Desmos to

             approximate a line or curve of best fit. On your keyboard, you can type it with Shift+` (in the top left corner). If

             you are using the Desmos on-screen keyboard, it will be in the ABC/symbol keyboard.
          To type an exponent, use the ^ symbol on your physical keyboard. You can type it using Shift+6. You can also use

             the Desmos keyboard button or .

    3. Once you have entered the regression equation, you can press Enter. The graph of the line or curve of best fit will

    appear. Pictured above and right is a quadratic curve of best fit. Desmos will also report correlation statistics such as

      and , as well as the value, value, and value in the expression list below the quadratic equation you entered.
     Tip: The window should be appropriately set to display the points in the table, but sometimes you have to adjust

    the window of the graph in order to properly view your data set. Click and drag the mouse to shift the viewing

    window. To zoom in or out, use the buttons in the top right or the scrolling wheel on the mouse. Or, edit the

Unit 1 Overview

Why Should I Care?

Do you know what a budget is? Have you ever used one? Watch the video to learn a bit about how City Manager Arthur
Noriega uses linear equations to manage the budget for the city of Miami.

Access multimedia content (http://openstax.org/books/algebra-1/pages/1-unit-1-overview)
In this unit, you will learn about using variables, expressions, and equations to model relationships. You will learn that
you can represent a constraint, or limit on what is possible in a situation, using expressions, equations, and inequalities.
This will be helpful whether you want to know how soon you'll be able to save for a new bicycle, or if you can afford to go
to a concert with your friends in two weeks.

You will also learn to transform one equation into an equivalent equation. Sometimes you want to write an equation in a
different form so you can solve for a certain variable or so you can write the equation in a form that makes it easier to
identify information about the relationship. You will learn how the form and parts of linear equations are related to the
features of its graph. A graph can be helpful to model a relationship and to make sense of the constraints.

Building Character: Social Intelligence

As a city manager, Arthur Noriega must work with others to develop budgets. Similarly, in this course, you will need to
work with your classmates to solve problems. Working well with others is a skill that will be useful to you in this course,
as well as outside of the classroom. Most jobs require the ability to work well, or collaborate, with other people.

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your social intelligence. Social intelligence is the ability to connect
with other people. Having this ability allows you to interact in a more positive manner with others. Being empathetic, or
sensitive to what others are feeling, shows that you care about others. In fact, empathetic people are less likely to
experience anxiety, depression, and addictions later in life. They are also more likely to be hired, promoted, earn more
money, and have happier marriages and better-adjusted children.

Think about your current sense of social intelligence. How many of the following statements are true for you?

  · I have a lot of relationships that are mutually beneficial, enjoyable, and supportive.
  · Most of the time, I can tell how other people feel and have a good idea about how to respond appropriately.
  · My relationships make me feel good about myself.
  · The people in my life help me be my best.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Am I Ready to Learn This?

Getting Ready for Unit 1

To be ready for this unit, you need to be able to:

  · Solve linear equations using a general strategy.
  · Classify equations.
  · Identify points on a graph.

Next, you will answer some questions that will help you see how ready you are for this unit. If you need help, some mini-
lessons will help you brush up on anything you need to work on.

    Solving Linear Equations Using a General Strategy

    A solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation. For

    example, in  , the value of the variable is 1.

    To find the solution to an equation in one variable, the goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. For
    example,

    You can check the solution by substituting the value into the equation.

    Equations may take several steps to solve, so it is helpful to have a clear and organized strategy. The following table
    shows a general strategy to solve any linear equation in one variable. You may not need to use every step.

      General Strategy for Solving Linear Equations
      Step 1
      Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.
      Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses.
      Combine like terms .
      Step 2
      Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.
      Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.
      Step 3
      Collect all the constant terms on the other side of the equation.
      Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.

    MINI LESSON QUESTION  Question #2: Classify Equations
                          Which of the following correctly classifies the equation and the solution?

                           a. contradiction; no solution
                          b. conditional equation;

                          d. identity; all real numbers

Use Solutions to Classify Equations

An equation that is true for one or more values of the variable and false for all other values of the variable is a
conditional equation.

Consider the equation     .
38  Unit 1 Overview and Readiness

                                           Subtract 8 to get the constants on one side.
                                     Divide by 7 to make the coefficient of the variable 1.

    The solution is        . This means the equation            is true when we replace the variable, , with the value

    , but it is not true when we replace with any other value. Whether the equation                        is true depends on

    the value of the variable. The equation is a conditional equation.

    An equation that is true for any value of the variable is called an identity. The solution of an identity is all real numbers.

    Consider the equation                     . Do you recognize that the left side and the right side are equivalent? Let's see
    what happens when we solve for .

                                              Distribute.

                                     Subtract to get the variables on one side.

    But  is true. This means the equation                       is true for any value of . The equation is an identity, and

    we say the solution is all real numbers.

    An equation that is false for all values of the variable is called a contradiction. A contradiction has no solution.

    Consider the equation            .

                                     Subtract to get the variables on one side.

MINI LESSON QUESTION Question #3: Find Coordinates

                                        a. Point
                                        b. Point

                                        d. Point

Identifying Coordinates of a Point on a Graph

In the rectangular coordinate system, every point is represented by an ordered pair. The first number in the ordered

pair is the -coordinate of the point, and the second number is the -coordinate of the point. An ordered pair,       ,

gives the coordinates of a point in a rectangular coordinate system. The first number is the -coordinate. The second

number is the -coordinate. The phrase "ordered pair" means the order is important. What is the ordered pair of the

point where the axes cross? At that point, both coordinates are zero, so its ordered pair is  . The point      has a

special name. It is called the origin.

We use the coordinates to locate a point on the -plane. Let's plot the point  as an example. First, locate 1 on the

-axis and lightly sketch a vertical line through  . Then, locate 3 on the -axis and sketch a horizontal line through

. Now, find the point where these two lines meet--that is the point with coordinates          .
40  Unit 1 Overview and Readiness

    Notice that the vertical line through     and the horizontal line through  are not part of the graph. We just used

    them to help us locate the point       .

    In algebra, being able to identify the coordinates of a point shown on a graph is just as important as being able to plot

    points. To identify the -coordinate of a point on a graph, read the number on the -axis directly above or below the

    point. To identify the -coordinate of a point, read the number on the -axis directly to the left or right of the point.

    Remember, when you write the ordered pair, use the correct order,  .

1.1 EXPLORING EXPRESSIONS AND EQUATIONS

1.1.0 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will experiment with expressions and equations to model a situation: planning a pizza party. For
instance, what are the relevant quantities when planning for a pizza party? Are these quantities fixed or do they vary?
How they might relate to one another? Are there any limitations or constraints on how much pizza should be ordered?

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

  · Tell which quantities in a situation can vary and which ones cannot.
  · Explain the meaning of the term "constraint."
  · Use letters and numbers to write expressions representing the quantities in a situation.

    1.1.3 Understanding Constraints

    Activity

    A constraint is something that limits what is possible or reasonable in a situation.

    For example, one constraint in a pizza party might be the number of slices of pizza each person could have, . We can

    write    to say that each person gets fewer than 4 slices.

    Look at the expressions you wrote when planning the pizza party earlier. Choose an expression that uses one or more
    letters.

    1. What is the expression you are examining?                2. What does the first letter represent?

    3. What values would be reasonable for this first           4. What does the second letter represent?
        letter? (For instance, could the value be greater
        than 50? Is it possible for the letter to be a non-
        whole number? A negative number?)

    5. What values would be reasonable for this second          6. Write equations or inequalities that represent some
        letter? (For instance, could the value be greater           constraints in your pizza party plan. If a quantity

Inequalities

One way to represent a constraint is to use an inequality symbol. For example, you may decide that at most 3 toppings
should be on each pizza. This could be represented by t < 3, if represents the number of toppings.

On the number line, the numbers get larger as they go from left to right. The number line can be used to explain the
symbols " " and " ."

        is read " is less than ." is to the left of on the number line.

    Verify a Solution of an Equation

    Solving an equation is like discovering the answer to a puzzle. The purpose in solving an equation is to find the value or
    values of the variable that make each side of the equation the same so that we end up with a true statement. Any value
    of the variable that makes the equation true is called a solution of an equation. It is the answer to the puzzle!

    How to determine whether a number is a solution to an equation:

    Step 1 - Substitute the number in for the variable in the equation.

    Step 2 - Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation

    Step 3 - Determine whether the resulting equation is true (the left side is equal to the right side).

    · If it is true, the number is a solution.

    · If it is not true, the number is not a solution.

    For example, the equation            represents the relationship between the length, , and the width, , of a

    rectangle that has a perimeter of 72 units. If we know that the length is 15 units, what is the value of the width?

    Step 1 - Substitute the number in for the variable in the equation.

    This is an equation in one variable because is the only quantity that we don't know. To solve this equation means to
    find a value of that makes the equation true.

    Solutions to Equations in Two Variables

    An equation that contains two unknown quantities or two quantities that vary is called an equation in two variables.

    A solution to such an equation is a pair of numbers that makes the equation true.

      EXAMPLE

    Suppose Tyler spends $45 on T-shirts and socks. A T-shirt costs $10, and a pair of socks costs $2.50. If represents the
    number of T-shirts and represents the number of pairs of socks that Tyler buys, we can represent this situation with
    the equation:

    3.  and

    In this situation, one constraint is that the combined cost of shirts and socks must equal $45.

    Solutions to the equations are pairs of and values that satisfy this constraint, such as in questions 1 - 2.

    Combinations such as             and  , as in question 3, are not solutions because they don't meet the constraint. When

    these pairs of values are substituted into the equation, they result in statements that are false.

Determining the Meaning of Solutions of a Graphed Line

Suppose we are buying beans and rice to feed a large gathering of people, and we plan to spend $120 on the two
ingredients. Beans cost $2 a pound, and rice costs $0.50 a pound.

If represents pounds of beans and pounds of rice, the equation  can represent the constraints in
this situation.

The graph of               shows a straight line.

Each point on the line is a pair of - and -values that make the equation true and is thus a solution. It is also a pair of
values that satisfy the constraints in the situation.

· The point   is on the line. If we buy 10 pounds of beans and 200 pounds of rice, the cost will be

              , which equals 120.

· The points  and          are also on the line. If we buy only beans--60 pounds of them--and no rice, we will

    spend $120. If we buy 45 pounds of beans and 60 pounds of rice, we will also spend $120.

What about points that are not on the line? They are not solutions because they don't satisfy the constraints, but they still
have meaning in the situation.

· The point   is not on the line. Buying 20 pounds of beans and 80 pounds of rice costs                         or 80,
                                                                                                                    or
    which does not equal 120. This combination costs less than what we intend to spend.

· The point   means that we buy 70 pounds of beans and 180 pounds of rice. It will cost

    230, which is over our budget of 120.

Let's look at an example.

EXAMPLE

1. Looking at the graph about purchasing beans and rice, is the point (30, 120) a solution?

     Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable

     We have all probably worked with some geometric formulas in our study of mathematics. Formulas are used in many
     fields, so it is important to recognize formulas and be able to manipulate them easily.

     It is often helpful to solve a formula for a specific variable. If you need to put a formula in a spreadsheet, it is not unusual
     to have to solve it for a specific variable first. We isolate that variable on one side of the equal sign with a coefficient of 1,
     and all other variables and constants are on the other side of the equal sign.

     Geometric formulas often need to be solved for another variable, too. The formula                  is used to find the

     volume of a right circular cone when given the radius of the base and height. In the next example, we will solve this
     formula for the height.

     EXAMPLE 1

     Solve       for .

     Step 1 - Remove the fraction on the right.
     Multiply both sides by 3.

     Step 2 - Simplify.
     Step 3 - Divide both sides by .

     We could now use this formula to find the height of a right circular cone when we know the volume and the radius of the
     base, by using the formula

     In the sciences, we often need to change temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa. If you travel in a foreign
     country, you may want to change the Celsius temperature to the more familiar Fahrenheit temperature.

Find the Slope of a Line

When you graph linear equations, you may notice that some lines tilt up as they go from left to right and some lines tilt
down. Some lines are very steep and some lines are flatter.

In mathematics, the measure of the steepness of a line is called the of slope the line. The concept of slope has many
applications in the real world. In construction the pitch of a roof, the slant of the plumbing pipes, and the steepness of
the stairs are all applications of slope. As you ski or jog down a hill, you definitely experience a slope. We can assign a
numerical value to the slope of a line by finding the ratio of the rise and run. The rise is the amount the vertical distance
changes while the run measures the horizontal change, as shown in this illustration. Slope is a rate of change.

Slope of a Line

The slope of a line is  . The rise measures the vertical change and the run measures the horizontal change. To

find the slope of a line, we locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers. Then we sketch a right triangle

where the two points are vertices and one side is horizontal and one side is vertical. To find the slope of the line, we

measure the vertical distance is called the rise and the horizontal distance is called the run.

How To Find the Slope from a Graph

Find the slope of a line from its graph using

Step 1 - Locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers.

Step 2 - Starting with one point, sketch a right triangle, going from the first point to the second point.

Step 3 - Count the rise and the run on the legs of the triangle.

Step 4 - Take the ratio of rise to run to find the slope:         .

EXAMPLE 1

Find the slope of the line shown.

Solution

Step 1 - Locate two points on the graph whose coordinates are integers.

and

Step 2 - Starting at    , sketch a right triangle to       as shown in this graph.
136  1.10 · Connecting Equations to Graphs, Part 1

     Step 3 - Count the rise(how many spaces up or down)-- since it goes down, it is negative.
     The rise is .
     Step 4 - Count the run (how many spaces to the right or left).
     The run is 3.
     Step 5 - Use the slope formula.

     Step 6 - Substitute the values of the rise and run.

     Step 7 - Simplify.

     So decreases by 2 units as increases by 3 units.

     Slopes of Horizontal and Vertical Lines

     How do we find the slope of horizontal and vertical lines? To find the slope of the horizontal line,  , we could graph

     the line, find two points on it, and count the rise and the run. Let's see what happens when we do this, as shown in the

     graph below.

     Step 1 - What is the rise?
     The rise is 0.
     Step 2 - What is the run?

     Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                               1.10.2 · Graphing Equations in Context       137

The run is 3.
Step 3 - What is the slope?

So The slope of the horizontal line  is 0.

Let's also consider a vertical line, the line  , as shown in the graph below.

Step 1 - What is the rise?
The rise is 2.
Step 2 - What is the run?
The run is 0.
Step 3 - What is the slope?

The slope is undefined since division by zero is undefined. So we say that the slope of the vertical line is undefined.
  · All horizontal lines have slope 0. When the -coordinates are the same, the rise is 0.
  · The slope of any vertical line is undefined. When the -coordinates of a line are all the same, the run is 0.

  Quick Guide to the Slopes of Lines

Sometimes we'll need to find the slope of a line between two points when we don't have a graph to count out the rise
and the run. We could plot the points on grid paper, then count out the rise and the run, but as we'll see, there is a
way to find the slope without graphing. Before we get to it, we need to introduce some algebraic notation.

We have seen that an ordered pair               gives the coordinates of a point. But when we work with slopes, we use two
points. How can the same symbol                be used to represent two different points? Mathematicians use subscripts to
distinguish the points.

We will use ( , ) to identify the first point and ( , ) to identify the second point. Let's see how the rise and run

relate to the coordinates of the two points by taking another look at the slope of the line between the points           ,

and  , as shown in this graph.
138  1.10 · Connecting Equations to Graphs, Part 1

     Step 1 - Since we have two points, we will use subscript notation.

     Step 2 - What is the slope?
     The rise is 3.
     The run is 5.
     Step 3 - What is the slope?

     On the graph, we counted the rise of 3 and the run of 5.
     Notice that the rise of 3 can be found by subtracting the -coordinates, 6 and 3, and the run of 5 can be found by
     subtracting the -coordinates, 7 and 2.
     Step 4 - We rewrite the rise and run by putting in the coordinates.

     But 6 is 2, the -coordinate of the second point and 3 is 1, the -coordinate of the first point. So we can rewrite the
     slope using subscript notation.

     Also, 7 is 2, the -coordinate of the second point and 2 is 1, the -coordinate of the first point. So again, we rewrite
     the slope using subscript notation

     We've shown that                 is really another version of         . We can use this formula to find the slope of a line

· For every number that is substituted for there is a corresponding value.

· This pair of values is a solution to the linear equation and is represented by the ordered pair  .

· When we substitute these values of and into the equation, the result is a true statement, because the value on

the left side is equal to the value on the right side.

Solution of a Linear Equation in Two Variables

An ordered pair       is a solution of the linear equation          , if the equation is a true statement when the -

and -values of the ordered pair are substituted into the equation.

Linear equations have infinitely many solutions. We can plot these solutions in the rectangular coordinate system. The
points will line up perfectly in a straight line. We connect the points with a straight line to get the graph of the equation.
We put arrows on the ends of each side of the line to indicate that the line continues in both directions.

A graph is a visual representation of all the solutions of the equation. It is an example of the saying, "A picture is worth a
thousand words." The line shows you all the solutions to that equation. Every point on the line is a solution of the
equation. And, every solution of this equation is on this line. This line is called the graph of the equation. Points not on
the line are not solutions!

When a linear equation in standard form is solved for , it is then easy to pick out the slope of the line and where the
graph of the line crosses the -axis.

EXAMPLE

Solve               for y

Step 1 - Move the term to isolate the    term.

Subtract from both sides.

Step 2 - Simplify.

Write the Equation of a Line Given the Slope and a Point

Writing an equation using the slope-intercept form works well when you are given the slope and -intercept. If you are
given the slope and another point that is not the -intercept, we need another form of the equation of a line.

The point-slope form of an equation of a line can be derived from the formula for slope. Suppose you have a line that

has slope and that contains some specific point            as point 1 and some other point,       , as point 2. You can

write the slope of this line and then change it to a different form.

Lines that are horizontal or vertical are special for two reasons. First, their equations have just one variable.

· Horizontal line     ; because all the -coordinates are the same and the slope equals zero.
· Vertical line    ; because all the -coordinates are the same and the slope is undefined.

Second, they have a special relationship with the x- and y-axes because they are either parallel or perpendicular to them.

     What is the slope?

     So, the horizontal line passing through     and               has a slope of 0. For all of the points on this line, the -values will

     always equal 4. So, the equation is      .

Since the line is perpendicular to the -axis, the line is vertical. This means the slope of the line is undefined!

Step 3 - Substitute the values into an equation.

Since the slope is undefined, we cannot use the point-slope equation. But, we know that if        is on the line, then
                                                                                                  . On a vertical line, the

-values do not change.

So,

EXAMPLE 3

Find an equation of a line perpendicular to          that contains the point       . Write the equation in slope-intercept
form.

Again, since we know one point, the point-slope option seems more promising than the slope-intercept option. We need

the slope to use this form, and we know the new line will be perpendicular to      . This line is vertical, so its

perpendicular will be horizontal. This tells us the     .

Step 1 - Identify the point.

Step 2 - Identify the slope of the perpendicular line.

Step 3 - Substitute the values into an equation.

Step 4 - Simplify

EXAMPLE 4

Find an equation of a line that is perpendicular to     that contains the point       . Write the equation in slope-
intercept form.

The line     is a horizontal line. Any line perpendicular to it must be vertical, in the form     . Since the perpendicular

line is vertical and passes through  , every point on it has an -coordinate of 2. The equation of the perpendicular

line is   .

     Throughout this unit, you learned that Arthur Noriega, Miami City Manager, has to consider constraints when planning a
     budget for various departments. He has to examine the relationships among quantities. He can use expressions,
     equations, and inequalities to represent the constraints for each department -- such as the number of workers needed,
     the salaries of the employees, or the cost of supplies -- to make sure he stays in budget. He can use graphs of equations
     to make sense of constraints and identify values that satisfy them.
     Similarly, in this unit, you learned how to use expressions, equations, and inequalities to represent constraints on
     quantities. You also used graphs of equations to make sense of constraints and identify values to solve them.
     You also learned to recognize moves that transform one equation into an equivalent equation. You used these moves to
     manipulate and solve equations. You also used these moves to write equations in point-slope form, standard form, and
     point-slope form.
     Finally, you learned how the form and parts of a linear equation in two variables are related to the features of its graph.
     You identified lines that are parallel and perpendicular using the relationship between slopes.

life. For example, solving systems of linear equations can help you with deciding which of two phone plans with different
flat fees and different costs per text charges is the better deal based on your usage.

Building Character: Growth Mindset

As an entrepreneur, Nafy Flatley must embrace challenges and try new strategies as she works to make her business a
success. Similarly, in this course, you may be faced with challenges as you work through new skills and concepts. Being
able to learn from mistakes and struggles is an important skill to have both in and out of the classroom.

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing a growth mindset. Having a growth mindset means believing you can
improve your abilities. Compared to a fixed mindset, a growth mindset encourages you to embrace challenges, sustain
effort, and try new strategies. Of course, no one embodies only a growth or fixed mindset; we are all a mixture of the
two, and we can learn to recognize what triggers a fixed versus growth mindset. The brain is like a muscle--something
you can strengthen.

Think about your current sense of having a growth mindset. How many of the following statements are true for you?

  · After I make a mistake, I always look for ways to learn from it.
  · I love challenges because they make me smarter.
  · I truly believe that people can change.
  · I can always change how intelligent I am.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Am I ready to learn this?

Getting Ready for Unit 2

     Evaluating Ordered Pairs as Solutions to a Linear Equation

     An ordered pair  is a solution of the linear equation               , if the equation is a true statement when the x-

     and -values of the ordered pair are substituted into the equation.

     Linear equations have infinitely many solutions. We can plot these solutions in the rectangular coordinate system. The
     points will line up perfectly in a straight line. We connect the points with a straight line to get the graph of the equation.
     We put arrows on the ends of each side of the line to indicate that the line continues in both directions.

     A graph is a visual representation of all the solutions of the equation. It is an example of the saying, "A picture is worth a
     thousand words." The line shows you all the solutions to that equation. Every point on the line is a solution of the
     equation. And, every solution of this equation is on this line. This line is called the graph of the equation. Points not on
     the line are not solutions!

     The graph of a linear equation       is a straight line.

         · Every point on the line is a solution of the equation.
         · Every solution of this equation is a point on this line.

     Let's examine the equation       .

     To analyze the equation, we may want to graph the line. If we change the equation to slope-intercept form, the equation

     is            .

     The graph of     is shown.

     For each ordered pair, decide:                       values into the equation to check if the ordered pair is a solution

     Graph a Line Using Its Slope and -intercepts

     We have graphed linear equations by plotting points, using intercepts, recognizing horizontal and vertical lines, and
     using one point and the slope of the line. Once we see how an equation in slope-intercept form and its graph are
     related, we'll have one more method we can use to graph lines.

     Let's look at the graph of the equation          and find its slope and -intercept.

The red lines in the graph show us the rise is 1 and the run is 2. Substituting into the slope formula:

The -intercept is 3.
Look at the equation of this line.

Look at the slope and -intercepts.

Slope equals 1 divided by 2 and -intercept (0, 3). The 1 divided by 2 is emphasized in red. The 3 is emphasized in blue.

When a linear equation is solved for , the coefficient of the term is the slope and the constant term is the -coordinate

of the -intercept. We say that the equation  is in slope-intercept form. Sometimes the slope-intercept form

is called the "y-form."

The slope-intercept form of an equation of a line with slope and -intercept, (0,b) is       .

Let's practice finding the values of the slope and -intercept from the equation of a line.

     Finding Intercepts of a Line

     Every linear equation can be represented by a unique line that shows all the solutions of the equation. We have seen that
     when graphing a line by plotting points, you can use any three solutions to graph. This means that two people graphing
     the line might use different sets of three points.

     At first glance, their two lines might not appear to be the same, since they would have different points labeled. But if all
     the work was done correctly, the lines should be exactly the same. One way to recognize that they are indeed the same
     line is to look at where the line crosses the -axis and the -axis. These points are called the intercepts of a line.

     Let's look at the graphs of the lines.

For each line, the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the -axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the
 -axis has the form (a, 0) and is called the -intercepts of the line. The -intercepts occurs when y is zero.

In each line, the x-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the -axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the

-axis has the form     and is called the -intercepts of the line. The -intercepts occurs when x is zero.

Recognizing that the -intercepts occurs when y is zero and that the -intercepts occurs when x is zero, gives us a

method to find the intercepts of a line from its equation. To find the -intercepts, let  and solve for x. To find the

-intercepts, let       and solve for y.

Solve Systems of Linear Equations

In Unit 1, you learned how to solve linear equations with one variable. Now we will work with two or more linear
equations grouped together, which is known as a system of linear equations.

An example of a system of two linear equations is shown below. We use a brace to show the two equations are grouped
together to form a system of equations.

A linear equation in two variables, such as      , has an infinite number of solutions. Its graph is a line. Remember,

every point on the line is a solution to the equation, and every solution to the equation is a point on the line.

To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two equations, we substitute the values of the variables into
220  2.1 · Writing and Graphing Systems of Equations

     each equation. If the ordered pair makes both equations true, it is a solution to the system.

     To solve a system of two linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions to both

     equations. In other words, we are looking for the ordered pairs  that make both equations true. These are called

     the solutions to a system of equations.

     Determining if Ordered Pairs Solve a System

     Step 1 - Substitute the values of both variables into the first equation and simplify. Verify if the equation is true.
     Step 2 - Substitute the values of both variables into the second equation and simplify. Verify if the equation is true.
     Step 3 - If the ordered pair makes both equations true, then it is a solution to the system.

     EXAMPLE 1

Solve a System of Linear Equations by Graphing
The graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two
equations, we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And by finding
what the lines have in common, we'll find the solution to the system.

  EXAMPLE

Solve the system by graphing                                                                    So, the slope is -2 and the

Step 1 - Graph the first equation.
To graph the first line, write the equation in slope-intercept form.

 -intercept is 7.

Step 2 - Graph the second equation on the same rectangular coordinate system.

This line may be easier to graph using the intercepts. To find the    -intercept, substitute    into the equation.
                                                                            into the equation.
                        To find the -intercept, substitute

So, the intercepts are  and  .

Step 3 - Determine whether the lines intersect, are parallel, or are the same line.
222  2.1 · Writing and Graphing Systems of Equations

     Look at the graph of the lines. In this case, the lines intersect.

     Step 4- Estimate the solution to the system.

     · If the lines intersect, identify the point of intersection. Check to make sure it is a solution to both equations. This is
         the solution to the system.

     · If the lines are parallel, the system has no solution.
     · If the lines are the same, the system has an infinite number of solutions.

     The lines intersect at           .

     Step 5 - Check the solution in both equations.

Meeting Constraints in a Real-World Situation

Let's look at a situation similar to the activity and discuss how to find values that meet the constraints given.

THEATER SEATS
224  2.1 · Writing and Graphing Systems of Equations

     A movie theater sells two types of tickets for a movie showing. Stadium recliner seats cost $18 each, and regular seats
     cost $15 each. The theater has a total of 40 seats. When every seat is sold, the theater earns $648 in ticket sales. How
     many stadium recliner seats, , and how many regular seats, , are there?

     To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that there are two constraints in this situation. The constraints are the
     total number of seats in the theater and the total money earned from sales. Let's write an equation to represent each
     constraint.

     Constraint #1: the total number of seats

     There are stadium recliner seats and regular seats representing a total of 40 seats.

     This is represented by the equation              .

     Constraint #2: the total sales from the seats

     Stadium recliner seats cost $18 and regular seats cost $15, for a total of $648.

     This is represented by the equation                 .

     There are many ways to solve these equations: graphing and algebraic solving, guessing and checking, or using tables.

     TRY IT  Meeting Constraints in a Real-World Situation
             Let's try creating a table. We know the total number of seats must equal 40. So we can try different
             values of seat types to determine if they match the total sales constraint, $648.
             If the total sales value is too low, try more stadium recliner seats, since they are more expensive.

Representing a Linear Function in Tabular Form

A system of equations is two or more equations. Often, each equation in a system of equations represents a situation.
Like other equations, the equations that make up the system can be represented by a table. When writing any equation
from a table into slope-intercept form, two things are needed: a slope and point, often the -intercept.
Example

Suppose a maglev train travels a long distance, and maintains a constant speed of 83 meters per second for a period of
time once it is 250 meters from the station. Here is a table that shows this constant speed.

Step 1 - Find the -intercept.  . This is the -intercept.
Notice that when
Step 2 - Find the slope.

To find the slope, find the change of over the change of     .

     Solving Systems by Graphing

     The graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two
     equations, we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And, by finding
     what the lines have in common, we'll find the solution to the system.
     Most linear equations in one variable have one solution, but we saw that some equations, called contradictions, have no
     solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers are solutions.

     The Elimination method of Solving Systems of Equations

     The Elimination Method is based on the Addition Property of Equality. The Addition Property of Equality says that
     when you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality. We will extend the Addition
     Property of Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the results are equal.

To solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we decide which
variable will be easiest to eliminate. How do we decide? We want to have the coefficients of one variable be opposites so
that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable
Notice how that works when we add these two equations together:

The 's add to zero, and we have one equation with one variable.
Let's try another one:

We can add the equations, so will be eliminated when we add these two equations.

Once we get an equation with just one variable, we solve it. Then we substitute that value into one of the original
equations to solve for the remaining variable. And, as always, we check our answer to make sure it is a solution to both
of the original equations.

  EXAMPLE
Solve the system by elimination:

Step 1 - Write both equations in standard form. If any coefficients are fractions, clear them.
Step 2 - Check to see if the coefficients of one variable are opposites or equivalent. The coefficients on the -variables
are equivalent. We can subtract the equations.
Step 3 - Subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.

Step 4 - Solve for the remaining variable.
Step 5 - Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations. Then solve for the other variable.

Step 6 - Write the solution as an ordered pair.
Step 7 - Check that the ordered pair is a solution to both original equations.

           created a third equation containing only one variable. This third equation can be solved to find the value of one
           of the variables. Using this value, you can find the value of the remaining unknown variable. You used solutions

Adding Two Equations in a Real-World Situation

Let's look at the situation described and write a system of equations.

Paulina went to the pool 8 times and the skating rink 4 times this month. She spent a total of $128 on admission to both
places. Last month, she went to the pool 3 times and the skating rink 4 times. Last month she spent $83 on admission to
both places.

Let represent the cost of the pool and represent the cost of the skating rink.

                                                                 This month Last month

So, this system represents the constraints in this situation:

Over both months, she went to the pool 11 times and the skating rink 8 times. She spent a total of $128 + $83, or $211,
over both months.

The equation that represents this total is          . Notice this is the equivalent of adding the like terms of the two
equations in the system of equations.

Let's solve the original system and determine if the solution also applies to this new equation.

Using substitution, we find that the solution is    , or the pool costs $9 and the skating rink costs $14.

Substitute these values into the new equation:

                         

Adding the equations together produces a new equation that has the same solution.

Solving a System of Equations by Elimination Using Multiplication

Let's look at an example where we need to multiply both equations by constants in order to make the coefficients of one
variable opposites.

Solve the system by elimination:

Solution
In this example, we cannot multiply just one equation by any constant to get opposite coefficients. So we will
strategically multiply both equations by different constants to get the opposites.
Step 1 - Write both equations in standard form. If any coefficients are fractions, clear them. Both equations are in
standard form.

Step 2 - Check to see if the coefficients of one variable are opposites or equivalent. To get opposite coefficients of , we
will need to multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second
equation by 3.

Step 3 - Simplify

Step 4 - Add the equations to eliminate one variable.

Step 5 - Solve for the remaining variable.
Step 6 - Substitute the solution into one of the original equations. Then solve for the other variable.

Step 7 - Check that the ordered pair is a solution to both original equations.

  · Explain how multiplying equations by a factor can help us solve systems of linear equations.

Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:

  · 2.6.1: Multiplying Equations by a Number
       In this activity, you use technology to graph a system of equations. Then you created new equations by
           multiplying any of the original equations by the same number. After graphing these new equations, you learned
           that multiplying an entire equation by a number does not change its solution.

  · 2.6.2: Writing a New System to Solve a Given System
       In this activity, you reviewed the process of multiplying one equation in a system of equations by a single
           number to form a new system of equations in order to solve by elimination. By solving the new system of
           equations, you showed that the solution to the system of equations was not changed from the original system of
           equations.

     Solving an Inconsistent System of Equations

     Now that we have several methods for solving systems of equations, we can use the methods to identify inconsistent

     systems. Recall that an inconsistent system consists of parallel lines that have the same slope but different -intercepts.

     They will never intersect. When searching for a solution to an inconsistent system, we will come up with a false

     statement, such as               .

     Solve the following system of equations.

     Solution

     We can approach this problem in two ways. Because one equation is already solved for , the most obvious step is to use
     substitution.

     Clearly, this statement is a contradiction because     . Therefore, the system has no solution.

     The second approach would be to first manipulate the equations so that they are both in slope-intercept form. We
     manipulate the first equation as follows:

We then convert the second equation expressed to slope-intercept form.

Comparing the equations, we see that they have the same slope but different -intercepts. Therefore, the lines are
parallel and do not intersect.

Applications with Linear Inequalities

Many real-life situations require us to solve inequalities. The method we will use to solve applications with linear
inequalities is very much like the one we used when we solved applications with equations.

We will read the problem and make sure all the words are understood. Next, we will identify what we are looking for and
assign a variable to represent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it easy to translate into an
inequality.

  EXAMPLE

Dawn won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom. The tablets she would like to buy cost
$254.12 each, including tax and delivery. Write an inequality to represent the maximum number of tablets Dawn can
buy.

In this lesson, you learned how to:

  · Write inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.

Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:

  · 2.8.1: Understanding Inequality Symbols
       In this activity, you recalled the meaning of inequality symbols (<, >, , and ) and the meaning of "solutions to
           an inequality." You were reminded that an inequality in one variable can have a range of values that make the
           statement true. You also explored the value that is at the boundary of an inequality and consider whether it is or
           isn't a solution to an inequality.

  · 2.8.2: Identifying Constraints in Inequalities
       In this activity, you were prompted to interpret several inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.
           To explain what the letters in the inequalities mean in the given context, you could not simply match the
           numbers in the verbal descriptions and those in the inequalities. You worked to attend carefully to the symbols
           and any operations, and reason both quantitatively and abstractly.

2.9 SOLUTIONS TO INEQUALITIES

2.9.0 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will investigate different ways to find the solution set to an inequality--by reasoning about the
quantities and relationships in context; by guessing some values, substituting them into the inequality, and checking
them to see if you make the inequality true; and by first solving a related equation in one variable.

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

  · Graph the solution to an inequality in one variable.
  · Solve one-variable inequalities.
  · Interpret the solutions to one-variable inequalities in terms of the situation.

     Coming up with snack mixes is not as simple as just combining ingredients. They have a lot of things to consider:
     What ingredients will they use? How much does each ingredient cost? What are the nutrititional values of each
     ingredient? How much does each ingredient weigh?

Graphing Linear Inequalities

What number would make the inequality        true? Are you thinking, " could be 4"? That's correct, but could be 6,

too, or 37, or even 3.001. Any number greater than 3 is a solution to the inequality     . We show all the solutions to

the inequality  on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of 3, to show that all numbers greater

than 3 are solutions. Because the number 3 itself is not a solution, we put an open circle at 3.

We can also represent inequalities using interval notation. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In

interval notation, we express       as  . The symbol  is read as "infinity." It is not an actual number.

The figure below shows both the number line and the interval notation.

The inequality  means all numbers less than or equal to 1. Here we need to show that 1 is a solution, too. We do

that by putting a closed circle at  . We then shade in all the numbers to the left of 1, to show that all numbers less

than 1 are solutions. See the figure below.

There is no lower end to those numbers. We write  in interval notation as  . The symbol - is read as

"negative infinity." The figure below shows both the number line and interval notation.

Solving Linear Inequalities

A linear inequality is much like a linear equation--but the equal sign is replaced with an inequality sign. So, when we
solve linear equations, we are able to use the properties of equality to add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides and
still keep the equality. Similar properties hold true for inequalities.
We can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality. For example:

Notice that the inequality sign stayed the same.
This leads us to the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality.

     For any numbers , , and , if           , then

       We can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality.

     What happens to an inequality when we divide or multiply both sides by a constant?
     Let's first multiply and divide both sides by a positive number.

     The inequality signs stayed the same.
     Does the inequality stay the same when we divide or multiply by a negative number?

     Notice that when we filled in the inequality signs, the inequality signs reversed their direction.

     When we divide or multiply an inequality by a positive number, the inequality sign stays the same. When we divide or
     multiply an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses.

     This gives us the Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality.

     Sometimes when solving an inequality, as in the next example, the variable ends up on the right. We can rewrite the
     inequality in reverse to get the variable to the left.

     Verify Solutions to an Inequality in Two Variables

     Previously we learned to solve inequalities with only one variable. We will now learn about inequalities containing two
     variables. In particular we will look at linear inequalities in two variables which are very similar to linear equations in two
     variables.
     Linear inequalities in two variables have many applications. If you ran a business, for example, you would want your
     revenue to be greater than your costs--so that your business made a profit.

       A linear inequality is an inequality that can be written in one of the following forms:

Recall that an inequality with one variable had many solutions. For example, the solution to the inequality  is any

number greater than 3. We showed this on the number line by shading in the number line to the right of 3, and putting

an open parenthesis at 3. See the figure below.

Similarly, linear inequalities in two variables have many solutions. Any ordered pair  that makes an inequality true
when we substitute in the values is a solution to a linear inequality.

The line with equation          is the boundary line that separates the region where                        from the

region where                 .

For an inequality in one variable, the endpoint is shown with a parenthesis or a bracket depending on whether or not is
included in the solution:

Similarly, for an inequality in two variables, the boundary line is shown with a solid or dashed line to show whether or
not it the line is included in the solution.

                        Boundary line is               Boundary line is

                     Boundary line is not included in solution. Boundary line is included in solution.

                             Boundary line is dashed.                      Boundary line is solid.

Now, let's take a look at what we found in the example above. We'll start by graphing the line          , and then we'll

     plot the five points we tested, as shown in the graph. See the figure below.

     In the previous example, we found that some of the points were solutions to the inequality             and some were
     not.

     Which of the points we plotted are solutions to the inequality         ?

     The points      and              are solutions to the inequality       . Notice that they are both on the same side of the

     boundary line            .

     The two points           and     are on the other side of the boundary line                        , and they are not solutions to
     the inequality
                              . For those two points.      .

     What about the point             ? The point          is a solution to the boundary line equation      , because       .

     However,        is not a solution to the inequality, because the boundary line is not included in the solution to the

     inequality            .

     Let's take another point above the boundary line and test whether or not it is a solution to the inequality            . The

     point       clearly looks to above the boundary line, doesn't it? Is it a solution to the inequality?

     So,         is a solution to     .

     Any point you choose above the boundary line is a solution to the inequality  . All points above the boundary
     line are solutions.

     Similarly, all points below the boundary line, the side with      and         , are not solutions to              , as shown

  Building Character: Growth Mindset

Compared to a fixed mindset, a growth mindset encourages you to embrace challenges, sustain effort, and try new
strategies. Of course, no one embodies only a growth or fixed mindset; we are all a mixture of the two, and we can
learn to recognize what triggers a fixed versus growth mindset. The brain is like a muscle--something you can
strengthen.

Think about your current sense of having a growth mindset. Are the following statements are true for you?

  · I truly believe that people can change.
  · I can always change how intelligent I am.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

     3. Take turns stating coordinates of points. Your
         partner will tell you whether your guess is a
         solution to their inequality. After each partner has
         stated a point, each may guess what the other's
         inequality is. If neither guesses correctly, play
         continues. Use another coordinate system to keep
         track of your guesses.
         What was your process for determining your
         partner's inequality?

Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables to Solve Applications

Many fields use linear inequalities to model a problem. While our examples may be about simple situations, they give us
an opportunity to build our skills and to get a feel for how they might be used.
For questions 1 - 3, use the following scenario to write, graph, and find solutions to an inequality:

  EXAMPLE

      Hilaria works two part-time jobs in order to earn enough money to meet her obligations of at least $240 a
      week. Her job in food service pays $10 an hour and her tutoring job on campus pays $15 an hour. How many
      hours does Hilaria need to work at each job to earn at least $240?
1. Let be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let be the number of hours she works
tutoring. Write an inequality that would model this situation.
Solution
We let be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let be the number of hours she works
tutoring. She earns $10 per hour at the job in food service and $15 an hour tutoring. At each job, the number of hours
multiplied by the hourly wage will gives the amount earned at that job.

2. Graph the inequality.
To graph the inequity, we put it in slope-intercept form.
362  2.13 · Solving Problems with Inequalities in Two Variables

     3. Find three ordered pairs      that would be solutions to the inequality. Then, explain what that means for Hilaria.

     From the graph, we see that the ordered pairs               ,  ,        represent three of infinitely many solutions. Check
     the values in the inequality.

     For Hilaria, it means that to earn at least $240, she can work 15 hours tutoring and 10 hours at her fast-food job, earn all
     her money tutoring for 16 hours, or earn all her money while working 24 hours at the job in food service.

Step 1 - Graph the points on a coordinate plane.

Step 2 - Determine possible lines.

Remember that the dots can be on the line, but they all have to be either above or below to create an inequality. If the
line has points on both sides, then the line isn't a possibility.

Let's try a few possibilities. We can start with the equation  to see if the points are above the line or below the line.
368  2.13 · Solving Problems with Inequalities in Two Variables

     The equation  cannot be a possibility because there are points above and below the line.

     Step 3 - Adjust the slope or -intercept

     We can change the slope and the -intercept to see how we can shift the line to be able to capture all the points. Let's

     move the line to below the       and        . We can leave the slope as 1 and change the -intercept to -7.

     There is still one point below the line. We could decrease the slope of the line to  .

     Now all of the points are above the line. This means that the value of  is always greater than the  value.

     So, one of the possible solutions could be                  .

     Part 2: Using Tables to Solve Inequalities in Two Variables

     Graph the linear inequality              using a table.

     Step 1 - Create a table of values using the related equation            to identify points on the boundary line of the
     inequality.

Step 2 - Plot the points and sketch the boundary line.
If the inequality is or , the boundary line is solid.
If the inequality is or , the boundary line is dashed.
The inequality sign is , so we draw a dashed line.

Step 3 - Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?

Test  as it is not on the boundary line of the inequality.

      is False.

So,   is not a solution.

Step 4 - Shade in one side of the boundary line.

If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.

If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.

The test point   is not a solution, so shade in the side of the boundary line that does not include  .

Determine Whether an Ordered Pair Is a Solution of a System of Linear Inequalities

The definition of a system of linear inequalities is very similar to the definition of a system of linear equations.
System of Linear Inequalities
Two or more linear inequalities grouped together form a system of linear inequalities.
A system of linear inequalities looks like a system of linear equations, but it has inequalities instead of equations. A
system of two linear inequalities is shown here.

To solve a system of linear inequalities, we will find values of the variables that are solutions to both inequalities. We

solve the system by using the graphs of each inequality and show the solution as a graph. We will find the region on the

plane that contains all ordered pairs  that make both inequalities true.

Solutions of A System of Linear Inequalities
Solutions of a system of linear inequalities are the values of the variables that make all the inequalities true.

The solution of a system of linear inequalities is shown as a shaded region in the  coordinate system that
includes all the points whose ordered pairs make the inequalities true.

To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two inequalities, we substitute the values of the variables into
each inequality. If the ordered pair makes both inequalities true, it is a solution to the system.

EXAMPLE

Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to this system:

a.)  b.)

a.) Is the ordered pair  a solution?

The ordered pair         made both inequalities true. Therefore   is a solution to this system.
b.) Is the ordered pair      a solution?

     2.14.3 Writing Systems of Inequalities that Represent Situations

     Activity

     Here are some situations you have seen before. Your teacher will give you one situation. Answer the questions for one
     situation. You will then meet with others in a group. You each will explain the situation and your answers.

     Bank Accounts

     · A customer opens a checking account and a savings account at a bank. They will deposit a maximum of $600 will be
         deposited into the two accounts, some in the checking account and some in the savings account. (They might not
         deposit all of it and keep some of the money as cash.)

     · The bank requires a minimum balance of $50 in the savings account. It does not matter how much money is kept in
         the checking account.

     Concert Tickets

     · Two kinds of tickets to an outdoor concert were sold: lawn tickets and seat tickets. Fewer than 400 tickets in total
         were sold.

     · Lawn tickets cost $30 each, and seat tickets cost $50 each. The organizers want to make at least $14,000 from ticket
         sales.

     Advertising Packages

     · An advertising agency offers two packages for small businesses that need advertising services. A basic package
         includes only design services. A premium package includes design and promotion. The agency's goal is to sell at
         least 60 packages in total.

     · The basic advertising package has a value of $1,000, and the premium package has a value of $2,500. The goal of
         the agency is to sell more than $60,000 worth of small-business advertising packages.

     Based on the discussions you had with your group members, answer the following questions about each situation.

     1. Write a system of inequalities to represent the                   2. Write a system of inequalities to represent the
         constraints. Specify what each variable represents                   constraints. Specify what each variable represents
         for the Bank Accounts situation.                                     for the Concert Tickets situation.

     3. Write a system of inequalities to represent the
         constraints. Specify what each variable represents
         for the Advertising Packages situation.

     For questions 4 - 6, use technology or paper to graph the systems of inequalities you identified in the previous

Write a System of Inequalities for a Situation

For questions 1 - 4, use the following scenario to write, graph, and find solutions to a system of inequalities.

      Christy sells her photographs at a booth at a street fair. At the start of the day, she wants to have at least 25
382  2.14 · Solutions to Systems of Linear Inequalities in Two Variables

           photos to display at her booth. Each small photo she displays costs her $4, and each large photo costs her $10.
           She doesn't want to spend more than $200 on photos to display.
     1. Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.

     Step 1 - Identify the Variables.

     Let the number of small photos.

     Let the number of large photos.

     Step 2 - To find the system of equations, translate the information. She wants to have at least 25 photos. The number of
     small plus the number of large should be at least 25.

     $4 for each small and $10 for each large must be no more than $200.

     Step 3 - Identify constraints based on the context.
     The number of small photos must be greater than or equal to 0.

     The number of large photos must be greater than or equal to 0.

     Step 4 - Write the system of inequalities.
     We have our system of equations.

     Since     and        (both are greater than or equal to zero), all solutions will be in the first quadrant. As a result, our

     graph shows only quadrant one.

     To graph             , graph    as a solid line. Choose                    as a test point. Since it does not make the inequality

The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is shaded the darkest. The boundary line sections that border

the darkly shaded section are included in the solution, as are the points on the -axis from        to   .

To determine if 10 small and 20 large photos would work, we look at the graph to see if the point       is in the
solution region. We could also test the point to see if it is a solution of both equations.

It is not, so Christy would not display 10 small and 20 large photos.

4. Could she display 20 large and 10 small photos?

To determine if 20 small and 10 large photos would work, we look at the graph to see if the point       is in the
solution region. We could also test the point to see if it is a solution of both equations.

It is, so Christy could choose to display 20 small and 10 large photos.

Notice that we could also test the possible solutions by substituting the values into each inequality.

Solve a System of Linear Inequalities by Graphing

The solution to a single linear inequality is the region on one side of the boundary line that contains all the points that
make the inequality true. The solution to a system of two linear inequalities is a region that contains the solutions to
both inequalities. To find this region, we will graph each inequality separately and then locate the region where they are
both true. The solution is always shown as a graph.

  EXAMPLE

Solve the system by graphing:

Answer:

Step 1 - Graph the first inequality.

· Graph the boundary line.
· Shade in the side of the boundary line where the inequality is true.

We will graph

We graph the line  It is a solid line because the inequality sign is .

We choose      as a test point. It is a solution to  , so we shade in above the boundary line.
386  2.14 · Solutions to Systems of Linear Inequalities in Two Variables

     Step 2 - On the same grid, graph the second inequality.

         · Graph the boundary line.
         · Shade the side of that boundary line where the inequality is true.

     We will graph             on the same grid.

     We graph the line                . It is a dotted line because the inequality sign is .

     Again, we use      as a test point. It is a solution so we shade in that side of the line       .

     Step 3 - The solution is the region where the shading overlaps.

     The point where the boundary lines intersect is not a solution because it is not a solution to     .

     The solution is all points in the area shaded twice, which appears as the darkest shaded region.

     Step 4 - Check by choosing a test point.

     We'll use          as a test point.

     make the inequality true, shade (red) the side that does not include the point

     Graph                              . The boundary line is                     . We test  and it makes the inequality true. We

     shade the side of the line that includes     .

     The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is shaded the darkest. The boundary line sections that

     border the darkly shaded section are included in the solution as are the points on the -axis from  to              .

     3. Could he eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie?

     Solution

     To determine if 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie would meet Omar's criteria, we see if the point   is in the solution region.
     It is, so Omar might choose to eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie.

     4. Could he eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies?

     Solution

     To determine if 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies would meet Omar's criteria, we see if the point  is in the solution
     region. It is, so Omar might choose to eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies.

     We could also test the possible solutions by substituting the values into each inequality.

     Unit 2 Wrap Up

     Throughout this unit, you learned that Nafy, owner of Teranga's snack mixes, can use constraints to create recipes for
     snack mixes that are nutritious and will make a profit for the company. She can use a system of equations to examine
     the company's profits. Constraints can be used to represent the upper and lower limits of weight, cost, and nutritional
     values of the snack mixes. Inequalities can be used to represent those constraints. Inequalities in two variables can be
     used to find combinations of two ingredients that meet constraints. Systems of inequalities can be used to find
     combinations of ingredients that create snacks that meet the company's goals of nutrition and cost.

     Similarly, in this unit, you learned how to write and solve systems of linear equations. You learned that the solution to a
     system of equations is a pair of coordinates that satisfies both equations. You used graphing and algebraic methods to
     find solutions.

     You also learned to use constraints to represent upper and lower limits in real-world situations. You used inequalities in
     one variable to represent these constraints. You learned that the solution set to one-variable inequalities is a range of
     values that can be graphed on a number line.

     Next, you wrote inequalities in two variables to represent constraints. You learned that the solution set is combinations
     of values that make the inequality true. The graph of the solution set is a region bounded by a line that may or not be
     part of the solution.

     Finally, you learned that two linear inequalities that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of
     inequalities. You learned that the solutions to the system include all pairs of numbers that satisfy both constraints
     simultaneously. You represented the solution set of the system graphically by identifying pairs of points in the region
     where the graphs of the individual inequalities overlap.

              you learned during this unit. Congratulations on completing Unit 2!

     Building Character: Growth Mindset

     In this unit, you learned that a growth mindset helps you focus on developing your abilities rather than proving how
     smart you are. The brain is like a muscle that you can strengthen. Improvement comes from challenging yourself and
     exercising your brain. When you make a mistake, use that as an opportunity to learn the error in your thinking. You may
     look for a similar example or find someone who can help you.

UNIT 3 OVERVIEW AND READINESS

Unit 3 Overview

Why Should I Care?

Do you ever think about where your food comes from, or what it takes to get those vegetables you're eating from the
ground to your plate? Watch the video to learn a bit about the organization Farms To Grow and how farmers use
statistics to make sound decisions for their farms.

Access multimedia content (http://openstax.org/books/algebra-1/pages/3-unit-3-overview)
In this unit, you will learn about how to graph two-dimensional data and create models of the data to make predictions.
You'll also use residuals to judge how good a model is and use correlation to describe how variables are related to each
other.

Building Character: Purpose

Through their organization, Farms to Grow, Gordon Reed and Dr. Gail Myers work to promote the sustainability and
history of Black farmers. They have a strong sense of purpose to make a positive contribution to the world.

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your purpose. Having purpose is showing a commitment to making a
meaningful contribution to the world. Purpose drives you to make positive contributions in line with your own interests
and strengths. And this pursuit gives your life direction and forward momentum; it motivates and guides your short-
term goals and daily activities. With a strong sense of purpose, you flourish: you enjoy a more meaningful life, are
healthier and more resilient to setbacks, live more energetically, and feel good about what you've accomplished.

Think about your current sense of purpose. How many of the following statements are true for you?

  · I look for ways to have positive effects on others' lives.
  · I often reflect on my life goals and the kind of person I want to be.
  · When I plan out my day, I consider how my activities connect to what I want to accomplish with my life.
  · I often think about what I can offer the world, taking into account what the world needs as well as my personal

      strengths and interests.
  · I often think about what matters most to me and why it matters.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Am I ready to learn this?

Getting Ready for Unit 3

To be ready for this unit, you need to be able to:

  · Distinguish linear patterns from nonlinear patterns based on scatter plots.
  · Identify positive and negative trends in a scatter plot.
  · Interpret slopes and -intercepts of graphs of linear equations.

Next, you will answer some questions that will help you see how ready you are for this unit. If you need help, some mini-
lessons will help you brush up on anything you need to work on.

     A scatter plot is a graph of numerical data with two variables. If two variables vary together in a predictable way, we say
     there is a statistical relationship between the two variables.

       · When the points of the scatter plot seem to fall along a line, the scatter plot is linear.
       · Nonlinear patterns seem to follow a curve.
       · If the scatter plot shows no pattern, it means there is no relationship between the variables.

              There is a relationship.        There is a relationship.   There is no relationship.

Drawing and Interpreting Scatter Plots

A scatter plot is a graph of plotted points that may show a relationship between two sets of data. If the relationship is
from a linear model or from a model that is nearly linear, the professor can draw conclusions using his knowledge of
linear functions.

Here is an example of a scatter plot.

Notice this scatter plot does not indicate a linear relationship. The points do not appear to follow a trend. In other words,
there does not appear to be a relationship between the age of the student and the score on the final exam.

  EXAMPLE: USING A SCATTER PLOT TO INVESTIGATE CRICKET CHIRPS

The table shows the number of cricket chirps in 15 seconds for several different air temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit.
422  3.1 · Linear Models

                                      Chirps  44 35 20.4 33 31 35 18.5 37 26

                          Temperature 80.5 70.5 57 66 68 72 52 73.5 53

     Plotting these data suggests that there may be a trend. We can see from the trend in the data that as the number of
     chirps increases every 15 seconds, the temperature increases. The trend appears to be roughly linear, though certainly
     not perfectly so.

     Once we recognize a need for a linear function to model that data, the natural follow-up question is: "What is that linear
     function?" One way to approximate our linear function is to sketch the line that seems to best fit the data. Then we can
     extend the line until we can verify the -intercept. We can approximate the slope of the line by extending it until we can
     estimate the .

     Continuing the Example: Finding a Line of Best Fit

     Find a linear function that fits the data above by "eyeballing" a line that seems to fit.

     On a graph, we could try sketching a line. Using the starting and ending points of our hand-drawn line, points  and

     , this graph has a slope of              and a -intercept at 30.

     The slope means that for every increase of 1 chirp per 15 seconds, the temperature increases 1.2 degrees.
     The -intercept stands for the temperature needed for crickets to start chirping.

Different methods of making predictions are used to analyze data. The method of interpolation involves predicting a
value inside the domain and/or range of the data. The method of extrapolation involves predicting a value outside the
domain and/or range of the data.

Model breakdown occurs at the point when the model no longer applies.

Continuing the Example: Understanding Interpolation and Extrapolation

Use the cricket data from the table to answer the following questions:

 1. Would predicting the temperature when crickets are chirping 30 times in 15 seconds be interpolation or
      extrapolation? Make the prediction and discuss whether it is reasonable.

 2. Would predicting the number of chirps crickets will make at 40 degrees be interpolation or extrapolation? Make the
      prediction and discuss whether it is reasonable.

Solution

1. The number of chirps in the data provided varied from 18.5 to 44. A prediction at 30 chirps per 15 seconds is inside the
domain of our data, so it would be interpolation. Using our model:

Based on the data we have, this value seems reasonable.

2. The temperature values varied from 52 to 80.5. Predicting the number of chirps at 40 degrees is extrapolation because
40 is outside the range of our data. Using our model:

We can compare the regions of interpolation and extrapolation using the following figure.

Activity

With a partner, you will take turns to match the graphs (https://openstax.org/r/match-graphs-3-3-3) of residuals to the
scatter plots that display linear models. The scatter plots and their lines of best fit are located on cards A - F. The graphs
of the residuals are located on cards G - L.

    the graph of the residuals.                            residuals are visible. Based on the residuals, which
                                                           line would produce the most accurate estimates?

What Do Residual Plots Tell Us?

Residuals tell us how close to accurate a line of best fit really is.

Ideally, the residual from a line of best fit will be scattered randomly above and below the horizontal line  on the

residual plot. The residual plot would have points above and below the horizontal line  . This shows that the

relationship between the two variables in the data set can be approximated by a linear model.

When the residuals are equal to 0, this indicates that the line of best fit goes through those points.

A curved pattern shows that a nonlinear model would be better to describe the relationships between points.

     The Meaning of Residuals

     Suppose that you have a scatter plot and that you have drawn the line of best fit on your plot. Remember that the
     residual for a point in the scatter plot is the vertical distance of that point from the line of best fit. In the previous lesson,
     you looked at a scatter plot showing how fuel efficiency was related to curb weight for five compact cars. The scatter plot
     and line of best fit are shown below.

     Consider the following questions:

      1. What kind of residual does Point A have?
                Point A has a large positive residual.

      2. What kind of residual does Point B have?
                Point B has a small positive residual.

      3. What kind of residual does Point C have?

     3.3.6 Lesson Summary

     In this lesson, you learned how to:

       · Plot and calculate residuals for a data set and use the information to judge whether a linear model is a good fit.

     Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:

       · 3.3.1: Subtracting an Estimated Value from an Actual Value
            In this activity, you discussed strategies and understandings you had for subtracting an estimated value from an
                actual value. This discussion helped you develop fluency and helped prepare you to compute residuals from a
                linear model.

       · 3.3.2: Plotting and Analyzing Residuals
            In this activity, you explored the concept of residuals, plotted residuals, and analyzed the residuals to informally
                assess the fit of a function. In this activity, you also fitted a function to data and used the function to solve
                problems. You learned that a residual is the difference between the actual -value for a point and the expected
                -value for the point on the linear model with the same associated -value.

       · 3.3.3: Matching Residuals Graphs to Scatter Plots
            In this activity, you took turns with a partner, matching graphs of residuals to scatter plots that displayed linear
                models. You explained your thinking and listened in order to explain your reasoning and critique the reasoning
                of others. You recognized that a plot of the residuals for data that are fit well by a linear model shows residuals
                that are close to the -axis and do not show a noticeable pattern.

474  3.4 · The Correlation Coefficient

     When is the value of the correlation coefficient positive?
       · The correlation coefficient is positive when as the -values increase, the -values also tend to increase.

     When is the value of the correlation coefficient negative?
       · The correlation coefficient is negative when as the -values increase, the -values tend to decrease.

     Is the linear relationship stronger when the correlation coefficient is closer to 0 or to 1 (or )?
       · As the points form a stronger negative or positive linear relationship, the correlation coefficient gets farther from 0.
           Students note that when all of the points are on a line with a positive slope, the correlation coefficient is . The
           correlation coefficient is if all of the points are on a line with a negative slope.

     The table below shows how you can informally interpret the value of a correlation coefficient.

Activity

Thinking back to the last activity, you learned about the -value. Write these characteristics about the -value.

The -value is called a correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient is one way to measure the strength of a linear
relationship.

  · The sign of is the same as the sign of the slope of the best fit line.
  · The values for go from -1 to 1 and include -1 and 1.
  · The closer is to 1 or -1, the stronger the linear relationship between the variables.
  · The closer is to 0, the weaker the linear relationship between the variables.

Take turns with your partner to match a scatter plot with a correlation coefficient. For each match you find, explain to
your partner how you know it's a match. For each match your partner finds, listen carefully to their explanation. If you
disagree, discuss your thinking and work to reach an agreement.

       One of the most powerful tools you can give a farmer to help improve their crop is statistics. Statistics can help
       farmers at every stage. For example, seeds are expensive, and if you plant too many strawberries in a market where
       there are hundreds of strawberry farmers, you might not sell enough to make a profit. With statistical models,
       farmers can use demand to precisely calculate the proper amount of crops to plant.

As the price of a bag of chips in dollars increases, the average rating of the bag of chips in points increases.

Does this represent a causal relationship or simply an association?

In this situation, the independent variable, price, does not seem to cause the rating a person gives the chips. While there
appears to be a positive association, there are other factors that may cause the ratings for a bag of chips to go up. For
instance, advertising on tv or social media might cause a particular kind of chip to increase in ratings without a change in
their price.

     Extending Your Thinking

     For questions 1 - 4, use the following instructions.

     Look through news articles or advertisements for claims of causation or correlation. Find 2 or 3 claims and read

     or watch the articles or the advertisements. Answer these questions for each of the claims.

     1. What is the claim?                                 2. What evidence is provided for the claim?

     3. Does there appear to be evidence for causation or  4. Choose the claim with the least or no evidence.
         correlation? Explain your thinking.                   Describe an experiment or other way that you
                                                               could collect data to show correlation or causation.

       Self Check

       Which of the following is a causal relationship?
        a. The lower the temperature, the more people go ice skating.
        b. The size of a deck and number of wood boards used.
        c. The temperature and number of people buying hot chocolate.
        d. The number of kids in a family and the number of pets in a family.

     Additional Resources

     Is It Causation?

     Correlation means there is a relationship or pattern between the values of two variables. A scatter plot displays data
     about two variables as a set of points in the -plane and is a useful tool for determining if there is a correlation
     between the variables.
     Causation means that one event causes another event to occur. Causation can only be determined from an appropriately
     designed experiment. In such experiments, similar groups receive different treatments, and the outcomes of each group
     are studied. We can only conclude that a treatment causes an effect if the groups have noticeably different outcomes.
     Why doesn't correlation mean causation?
     Even if there is a correlation between two variables, we cannot conclude that a change in one variable causes a change
     in the other. This relationship could be coincidental, or a third factor may be causing both variables to change.

       EXAMPLE

     Liam collected data on the sales of ice cream cones and air conditioners in his hometown. He found that when ice cream
     sales were low, air conditioner sales tended to be low, and that when ice cream sales were high, air conditioner sales
     tended to be high.
     Liam can conclude that sales of ice cream cones and air conditioners are positively correlated.
     Liam can't conclude that selling more ice cream cones causes more air conditioners to be sold. It is likely that the
     increases in the sales of both ice cream cones and air conditioners are caused by a third factor, an increase in
     temperature!

3.6.6 Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to:

  · Analyze connections between two variables to determine whether or not there is a causal relationship.

Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:

  · 3.6.1: Describing the Relationship between Variables
       In this activity, you described the relationship between variables using mathematical terminology, such as strong
           or weak relationship and positive or negative relationship.

  · 3.6.2: Describing How Two Variables Are Related
       In this activity, you described how two variables are related and determined whether or not there is a causal
           relationship. You began to recognize that some variables may be related, but one does not always cause the
           other to change. You were able to recognize that at this point, the mathematics of scatter plot analysis cannot
           determine whether there is a causal relationship. You recognized that the relationship must be thought through
           carefully to decide, based on the situation, whether the related variables have a causal relationship.

PROJECT 3: TWO-VARIABLE STATISTICS

Project 3 Overview

In this culminating project, you will integrate ideas from the unit as you collect, summarize, interpret, and draw
conclusions from bivariate data using scatter plots, best fit lines, and correlation coefficients.
Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for you to choose to use appropriate technology to
solve problems.

Project Activities

 1. Estimating Lengths
 2. Analyze Data

Learning Targets

When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:
  · Collect data, create a linear model to fit the data, determine if the linear model is a good fit, and use the information
      from my linear model to answer questions.

Estimate Lengths

An anthropologist finds a fossilized humerus bone of an ancient human ancestor. The humerus is an arm bone running
from the shoulder to the elbow. It is 24 centimeters in length. Use data from your classmates to estimate the height of
this ancient human.

Analyze Data

 1. Before researching data, do you think the number of penalties a team gets in a season is correlated to the number
      of wins the team gets in that season? Do you think it is a positive or negative relationship? Do you think the
      relationship is weak or strong? Be prepared to show your reasoning.

 2. Is there a relationship between the number of penalties a team gets in a season and the number of wins in that
      season? Show any mathematical work that leads to your answer.

 3. Do penalties cause a change in wins or wins cause a change in penalties or neither? Be prepared to show your
      reasoning.
516  Project 3: Two-Variable Statistics

     Unit 3 Wrap Up

     Throughout this unit you learned that farmers, such as the Black and underserved farmers Farms To Grow founders
     Gordon Reed and Gail Myers work with, can use statistics to help them make decisions about their business. Statistics
     can help them decide the amount of crops they should grow, and how to package and ship their product. They can study
     weather and rainfall patterns and investigate how types of soil affects their crop. These decisions help assure them they
     will have a sustainable farm.
     In this unit, you learned how a linear model is used to describe the relationship between two variables quantitatively.
     You learned that a linear model is an approximation based on data from a scatter plot. The linear model allows you to
     make predictions in a range near the given data.
     You used technology to find the equation of the line of best fit and interpreted the slope and -intercepts in the context
     of the situation. You used the linear model to estimate values not given in the data set.
     You assessed the fit of the linear model informally using residuals and them formally using the correlation coefficient.
     Finally, you learned that if a change in one of the variables directly causes a change in the other variable, then it is a
     causal relationship. You learned that a strong correlation does not imply a causal relationship, so you learned to analyze
     the relationship between two variables to determine whether they are causal or not.

              Access our Unit 3 Student Self-Assessment (https://openstax.org/r/unit-3-self-assesment) to reflect on the skills
              you learned during this unit. Congratulations on completing Unit 3!

     Building Character: Purpose

     Throughout this unit, you learned that having purpose is good for both you and the world. It drives you to make positive
     contributions to the world that are in line with your own interests and strengths, as you saw Gordon and Gail do with
     their organization. As you continue along your journey in school and beyond, remember to think about what you want to
     contribute to the world and how you can be helpful to others. This may help you lead a happier, more fulfilling life.

INQUIRY PROJECT: DEFINING FUNCTIONS

Inquiry Project Overview

In this project, you will apply your prior knowledge about plotting coordinate points, evaluating expressions using the
correct order of operations, and simplifying algebraic expressions, to generate initial ideas about functions.

First, you will be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play time allows for you to learn how to use
a simulation for learning and discover how to interact with it. You will have an opportunity to share how you used the
simulation during the open play time. Be sure you are aware of the controls and how to use the simulation.

When you engage with the activity sheet, you should be pausing to discuss some of your responses with a partner. Be
prepared to stop and share your individual responses and partner discussions with the whole class.

By the end of the lesson, you should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to
describe a function as having inputs, outputs, and behaving consistently. You should also be able to evaluate a function
using different inputs, and be able to summarize the impact that certain operations have on the algebraic function, the
table of values, the appearance of the graph, and the outputs.

Project Activities

 1. Simulating Relationships
 2. What is a Function?
 3. Different Kinds of Functions

Learning Targets

When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:

  · Define a function as a rule relating each input to exactly one output and consistently acting on inputs.
  · Predict outputs of a function using given inputs.
  · Describe a linear function in terms of a table, graph, equation, or series of operations.

Why Should I Care?

What do you do when faced with a challenge or problem? Do you brainstorm ideas to solve it? Ask others for help?
Watch the video to learn how researcher Supratim Das uses creativity and functions to solve the issue of a longer life for
batteries.

Access multimedia content (http://openstax.org/books/algebra-1/pages/4-unit-4-overview)
In this unit, you will learn about functions. Understanding how to use functions to model relationships can help you, for
example, decide which smartphone plan is better and how much you will need to earn each week to pay for the one you
choose.

Building Character: Creativity

As a scientist, Supratim Das uses his creativity to solve challenging issues. Similarly, in this course, you will want to use
your creativity to solve problems.

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your creativity. Creativity is the ability to think of new solutions. When
you approach life with a creative attitude, you are more open to new ideas and possibilities, better able to understand
others' perspectives, and more likely to seek out multiple solutions to problems. Despite the stereotype of the mad
genius, everyday creativity is just as important. You can use it to help you improve your mood and cope with stress, feel
more connected with other people and the world--and even help you find meaning and purpose in life.

Think about your current sense of creativity. How many of the following statements are true for you?

  · I often seek out new experiences and ways of doing things.
  · I like to think of different ways to reach my goals.
  · I often make decisions that take me outside my comfort zone.
  · I have a playful attitude toward learning something new.
  · I enjoy connecting the dots between seemingly different perspectives and thoughts.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Am I Ready to Learn This?

Getting Ready for Unit 4

To be ready for this unit, you need to be able to:

  · Find the slope of the line that goes through two points on a graph.
  · Interpret the meaning of a situation from a graph.
  · Use a pattern to find the next term in a sequence.

Next, you will answer some questions that will help you see how ready you are for this unit. If you need help, some mini-

                          Which statement best describes the situation shown in the graph?

                                                    a. Mai begins at a neighbor's house and runs away from home, and then walks for
                                                          a while.

                                                    b. Mai begins at a neighbor's house and walks away from home at a constant rate.
                                                    c. Mai begins at home and walks away from her home at a constant rate.
                                                    d. Mai begins her walk at school and walks home at a constant rate.

Match a Description with a Graph

A graph can be used to model a situation. You can use what you know about slope and -intercept to connect the graphs
to real situations.

A.

     B.

     C.
     Match each description with one of the graphs above:
     1. Elena begins at home and runs away from her home at a constant rate.
     Elena starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She moves away from home at a constant speed, so the
     graph must be a line that increases to the right. Graph B matches the description.
     2. Clare begins her walk at school and walks home at a constant rate.
     Clare starts at school, so the -intercept is a point on the -axis that shows the distance her home is from the school. She
     moves closer to home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that decreases to the right. Graph C matches the
     description.
     3. Lin begins at home and runs away from home, and then walks for a while.
     Lin starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She starts running and then walks, so the graph is a line with a
     slope that starts off steep and then continues with a less steep slope. Graph A matches the description.

     Extend a Pattern: Mini-Lesson Review

     MINI LESSON QUESTION             Question #3: Extend a Pattern
                                      Which describes the rule and the next two terms in the sequence?

                                      2, 6, 18, 54, . . .

                                       a. Multiply by 4; 216, 864
                                      b. Add 3; 57, 60
                                       c. Add 4; 58, 62
                                      d. Multiply by 3; 162, 486

     Use a Rule to Extend a Pattern

     Pattern rules can use one or more mathematical operations to describe the relationship between consecutive numbers
     in a list of numbers, or sequence. Knowing the pattern rule will help you extend the pattern. To extend the pattern
     means to use the pattern rule to write the numbers that would come next in the sequence.

     Try to see the difference between consecutive numbers. It will help you understand the relationship between the
     numbers.

     Find the next two numbers in the following sequence:

     3, 6, 9, 12, . . .

     First, figure out the pattern rule. The numbers are increasing, so the rule likely involves addition or multiplication.

       · Look at the first two terms, 3 and 6. What operation could you perform on 3 to get 6?
            You could add 3.
            You could multiply by 2.
            You could do a combination of two or more operations.

       · Look at the second two terms, 6 and 9.
            If you add 3 to 6, you get 9. So the pattern rule "add 3" seems to work.

       · Make sure the pattern rule "add 3" works for every term.
           

     The pattern rule works. To extend the pattern, apply the pattern rule of "add 3" to the last term, 12, to get the next term,
     and then "add 3" to the result to get another term. The answer is that the extended pattern is:

     3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, . . .

     You can find a particular term in the pattern by extending the pattern until you've reached the term you are looking for.

     What is the seventh number in the following sequence?

     64, 32, 16, 8, . . .

     First, figure out the pattern rule. The numbers are decreasing, so the rule likely involves subtraction or division.

       · Look at the first two terms, 64 and 32. What operation could you perform on 64 to get 32?
            You could subtract 32.
            You could divide by 2.
            You could do a combination of two or more operations.

       · Look at the second two terms, 32 and 16.
            If you subtract 32 from 32, you get 0, not 16. So the pattern rule "subtract 32" does not work.
            If you divide 32 by 2, you get 16. So the pattern rule "divide by 2" seems to work.

       · Make sure the pattern rule "divide by 2" works for every term.
           

     The pattern rule works. To extend the pattern, apply the pattern rule of "divide by 2" to the last term, 8, to get the next
     term, and continue dividing by 2 until you reach the seventh term.

4.1.1 Contrasting Two Relationships by Reasoning

Warm Up
534  4.1 · Describing and Graphing Situations

     A customer at a bagel shop is buying 13 bagels. The store worker says, "That would be $16.25." Jaime, Pedro, and
     Hannah, who are in the shop, all think it is a mistake.

       · Jaime says, "Shouldn't the total be $13.25?"
       · Pedro says, "I think it should be $13.00."
       · Hannah says, "No, I think it should be $11.25."

     Consider how the store worker, Jaime, Pedro, and Hannah could all be right.

     In the following activity, you will be asked to use the pricing information displayed at the bagel shop to determine who is
     correct about the pricing for 13 bagels.

     5. As a customer, do you like items to be priced like this or not? Explain your reasoning.

     In this activity, because there was only one best price for a particular number of bagels, the best price is a function of
     the number of bagels bought.
     A function assigns one output to each input.

  · Day 2: The dog walked around for the first minute and then laid down until its owner returned.
  · Day 3: The dog tried to follow its owner into the store but was stopped by the leash. Then, it started walking around

      the post in one direction. It kept walking until its leash was completely wound up around the post. The dog stayed
      there until its owner returned.
  · Each day, the dog was 1.5 feet away from the post when the owner left.
  · Each day, 60 seconds after the owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.

Your teacher will assign one of the days for you to analyze. You will sketch a graph that could represent the dog's
distance from the post, in feet, as a function of time, in seconds, since the owner left.

Then, meet with someone in your group who had Day 2's movement and someone who had Day 3's movement. Work
together to explain your graphs and make changes where needed before checking your work. Be sure to sketch each
other's graphs.

Is the Relation a Function?

A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The set of the first components of each ordered pair are the inputs and the set of the
second components of each ordered pair are the outputs. Consider the following set of ordered pairs. The first numbers
in each pair are the first five natural numbers. The second number in each pair is twice that of the first.
540  4.1 · Describing and Graphing Situations

     The set of inputs is {           }. The set of outputs is {    }.

     Each input value is the independent variable, and is often labeled with the lowercase letter . Each output value, is the
     dependent variable, and is often labeled lowercase letter .

     A function is a relation that assigns a single output to each input. In other words, no -values are repeated. For our

     example that relates the first five natural numbers to numbers double their values, this relation is a function because

     each input, {1,2,3,4,5}, is paired with exactly one output, {      }.

     Now let's consider the set of ordered pairs that relates the terms "even" and "odd" to the first five natural numbers. It
     would appear as

     { (odd,1),(even,2),(odd,3),(even,4),(odd,5) }

     Notice that each input, {even,odd} is not paired with exactly one output, {  }. For example, the term "odd"

     corresponds to three output values, {1,3,5} and the term "even" corresponds to two output values, { }. This violates the

     definition of a function, so this relation is not a function.

     A mapping is sometimes used to show a relation. The arrows show the pairing of the inputs with the outputs.

     Here are some relations that are functions and not functions.

     a. This relationship is a function because each input is associated with a single output. Note that inputs and both
          give output .

     b. This relationship is also a function. In this case, each input is associated with a single output.
     c. This relationship is not a function because input is associated with two different outputs.

      How to determine if a relationship is a function.

       1. Identify the input values.
       2. Identify the output values.
       3. If each input value leads to only one output value, classify the relationship as a function. If any input value leads

            to two or more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.

Activity

In a function, there are two quantities called variables. The independent variable is the input, while the dependent
variable is the output.
Here are two pairs of quantities from a situation you've seen in this lesson. Each pair has a relationship that can be
defined as a function.

  · Time, in seconds, since the dog owner left and the total number of times the dog has barked

Identifying if a Relationship Is a Function

A function is a relation in which each possible input value leads to exactly one output value. We say "the output is a
function of the input."

  How to determine if a relationship is a function.

   1. Identify the input values.
   2. Identify the output values.
   3. If each input value leads to only one output value, classify the relationship as a function. If any input value leads

        to two or more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.

     In a particular math class, the overall percent grade corresponds to a grade point average. Is grade point average a
     function of the percent grade? Is the percent grade a function of the grade point average? The table below shows a
     possible rule for assigning grade points.

             Percent grade                     0-56 57-61 62-66 67-71 72-77 78-86 87-91 92 - 100

     Solution

     For any percent grade earned, there is an associated grade point average, so the grade point average is a function of the
     percent grade. In other words, if we input the percent grade, the output is a specific grade point average.

     In the grading system given, there is a range of percent grades that correspond to the same grade point average. For
     example, students who receive a grade point average of 3.0 could have a variety of percent grades, ranging from 78 all
     the way to 86. Thus, percent grade is not a function of grade point average.

Understanding Function Notation

Using Function Notation

Once we determine that a relationship is a function, we need to display and define the functional relationships so that
we can understand and use them, and sometimes also so that we can program them into computers. There are various
ways of representing functions. A standard function notation is one representation that facilitates working with
functions.

To represent "height is a function of age," we start by identifying the descriptive variables for height and for age. The
letters , , and are often used to represent functions, just as we use , , and to represent numbers and , , and
to represent sets.

· is of : We name the function ; height is a function of age.

·             : We use parentheses to indicate the function input.

·  : We name the function ; the expression is read as " of ."

Remember, we can use any letter to name the function; the notation shows us that depends on . The value
must be put into the function to get a result. The parentheses indicate that age is input into the function; they do not
indicate multiplication.

We can also give an algebraic expression as the input to a function. For example,  means "first add and , and

the result is the input for the function ." The operations must be performed in this order to obtain the correct result.

Function Notation

The notation       defines a function named      . This is read as " is a function of ." The letter represents the input
                                                  , represents the output value, or dependent variable.
value, or independent variable. The letter , or

EXAMPLE: USING FUNCTION NOTATION FOR DAYS IN A MONTH

Use function notation to represent a function whose input is the name of a month and output is the number of days in
that month (don't include leap years).

For example, (March) , because March has 31 days. The notation       reminds us that the number of days,
(the output), is dependent on the name of the month, (the input).

Analysis

Note that the inputs to a function do not have to be numbers; function inputs can be names of people, labels of
geometric objects, or any other element that determines some kind of output. However, most of the functions we will
work with in this course will have numbers as inputs and outputs.

Interpreting Equations in Function Notation

What does a statement like             mean?

On its own,      only tells us that when takes 3 as its input, its output is 12.

If we know what quantities the input and output represent, however, we can learn much more about the situation that
the function represents.

If function gives the perimeter of a square whose side length is and both measurements are in inches, then we can

interpret        to mean "a square whose side length is 3 inches has a perimeter of 12 inches."

We can also interpret statements like         to mean "a square with side length has a perimeter of 32 inches,"

which then allows us to reason that must be 8 inches and to write  .

If function gives the number of blog subscribers, in thousands, months after a blogger started publishing online,

then             means "3 months after a blogger started publishing online, the blog has 12,000 subscribers."

It is important to pay attention to the units of measurement when analyzing a function. Otherwise, we might mistake

what is happening in the situation. If we miss that is measured in thousands, we might misinterpret            to mean

"there are 36 blog subscribers after months," while it actually means "after 36 months, there are thousands of blog

subscribers."

Evaluating Functions with Function Notation

Find the Value of a Function

It is very convenient to name a function, and most often we name it , , or . In any function, for each -value from the
domain we get a corresponding -value in the range. For the function , we write this range value as . This is
called function notation, and is read of or the value of at . In this case, the parentheses do not indicate
multiplication.

Function Notation

For the function            :

· is the name of the function.

· is the input value.

·        is the output value, , corresponding to the value of .

We read     as of or the value of at .

We call the independent variable as it can be any value in the domain. We call the dependent variable as its value
depends on .

Independent and Dependent Variables

For the function            ,

is the independent variable as it can be any value.

is the dependent variable as its value depends on .

Much as when you first encountered the variable , function notation may be rather unsettling. It seems strange
because it is new. You will feel more comfortable with the notation as you use it.

     VERTICAL LINE TEST

     A set of points in a rectangular coordinate system is the graph of a function if every vertical line intersects the graph in at
     most one point.

     If any vertical line intersects the graph in more than one point, the graph does not represent a function.

     If the graph does represent a function, we say it "passes the vertical line test."

     Determine If a Graph Is a Function

     A relation is a function if every input has exactly one output value. So the relation defined by the equation            is a

     function. Notice that a line will always be a function, so it is called a linear function.

     If we look at the graph, each vertical dashed line intersects the line at only one point. This makes sense because in a
     function, for every -value there is only one -value.

     If the vertical line hit the graph twice, the -value would be mapped to two -values, so the graph would not represent a
     function.

     This leads us to the vertical line test. A set of points in a rectangular coordinate system is the graph of a function if every
     vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point. If any vertical line intersects the graph in more than one point, the
     graph does not represent a function.

     Look at the graphs below:

     Graph a passes the vertical line test because if an imaginary vertical line were drawn anywhere on the graph, it would
     only touch one time.
     Graph a is a function.
     Graph b does not pass the vertical line test because when a vertical line is drawn down the graph, there is at least one
     place where the vertical line touches twice.
     Graph b is not a function.

negative infinity, linear functions do not have maximums or minimums, unless their domain is restricted to a specific
part of the graph.

You can still pick out key features of linear functions.

The -intercept, or zero, is where the line crosses the -axis. This is where the -coordinate is 0.

In this linear function, the -intercept, or zero, is      and written as the point  .

     4.7.3 Writing Linear Equations

     Activity

     In Algebra, equations are commonly written in three different ways: slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and
     standard form. They are equivalent ways to write the same equation, but each one is useful for different reasons.

     Slope-intercept form Point-slope form                                       Standard form

                          Given:                 Given:                                                 slope
                             slope         a point                                            Where:
                                                                 There are no fractions and cannot be negative.
                           -intercept                slope

     For slope-intercept form, the slope and -intercept are needed:

     1. Write an equation in slope-intercept form for a line whose slope is -2 and -intercept is     .

     For point-slope form, the slope and one point are needed:

     2. Write an equation in point-slope form for a line whose slope is and goes through the point

     Standard form of a linear equation is often used to find - and -intercepts of graphs.

     Often, an equation starts in another form and gets put into standard form.

     Standard form does not have fractions or decimals and cannot lead with a negative number.

     3. What is the slope in the equation         ?

     What is the average rate of change of the first 10 minutes of the race?

     To find the average rate of change of the first 10 minutes of the race, you would look at the first data value on the table
     and the third data value on the table, since it corresponds to 10 minutes.

     Remember, the average rate of change formula is              , where      typically represents your second data point

     and          represents your first data point.

     For this situation, it would be  or                and       and      or        and        .

     Substituting the points into the average rate of change formula results in the following:

     Which had a greater average rate of change between 10.2 and 10.4 Sol, ground temperature or air temperature? What is
     the meaning of each rate change?
     Since ground temperature has a greater slant or slope, it has a greater rate of change. Slope is another word for the rate
     of change of a graph.
     To find the average rate of change, first you need to find Sol on the graph (which is what a day is called on Mars). Find

Substitute each set of points into the average rate of change formula:

Remember that to interpret the meaning of the rate of change, you need to compare the axes. It is the change in the

-axis units divided by the change in the -axis units, or                                   . That means that the average

rate of change of each can be interpreted as:

Ground Temperature's average rate of change is 350 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).

Air Temperature's average rate of change is 150 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).

A: Sam rides his bike to his friend's house at a constant rate for 20 minutes.
B: Sam plays for 20 minutes at his friend's house.
C: Sam and his friend bike together to an ice cream shop that is between their houses for 20 minutes.

The distance from home is increasing as Sam rides to his friend's house. While playing at his friend's house, the distance
remained constant and unchanged. When Sam left his friend's house for the ice cream shop, the distance from home
decreased because the shop is in between their houses, so Sam was getting closer to home.

Solution Since
                , the -intercept is +7, so the graph shifts up 7 from the parent function.
  EXAMPLE 2

Tell how        has shifted from the parent function       .
Solution Since

  EXAMPLE 3

Tell how        has shifted from                 .

Solution Since  , the -intercept is 1. This point is 4 vertical units below the -intercepts of the original line that had

a -intercept of 5. So, the graph shifts down 4 units from     to arrive at                      .

Horizontal Shifts and -intercepts

In addition to being shifted vertically, graphs can also be shifted to the right or left. For linear functions, this is
sometimes hard to identify because a line that is shifted horizontally may appear to have a vertical shift.

Let's shift the parent function,   , horizontally to the left 7 units.

If the line shifts horizontally 7 units to the left, the -intercept is shifted 7 units to the left, as well.

The graph of the parent function,  , is represented by the dashed orange line. The graph of the solid blue line

represents the line that we horizontally shift 7 units to the left.
668  4.11 · Graphing a Function Using Transformations

     To determine the equation of the shifted line, we use the slope of 1 and       as a point on the line.
     Substituting these values into point-slope form, we get:

     So, the equation of a line that has been shifted 7 units to the left from the parent function,       , is
                                                                                                                   is equivalent
     But, doesn't it look like the function            was shifted up 7 units, too? This is because

     to         . And this is what makes horizontal shifts difficult to see.

     EXAMPLE 1

     How has the function                    been transformed from             ?

     Solution

     To answer this question, first consider how the -values, including the -intercept, are being changed. The function says
     to subtract 4 from each x-value. This means the function is being shifted 4 units.

     Next, we need to determine which direction the -values are being shifted. Let's look at the graphs.

     The solid blue line represents the graph of       . The dashed orange line represents the graph of            .

     On the graph, we can look at specific points on the parent function like the -intercept (0, 0) and (1, 3). The transformed
     line is to the right of our parent function. To determine how far to the right the line has been shifted, we count the
     number of horizontal units between the lines.

     · We see that (0, 0) corresponds to the point (4, 0) on the transformed line.
     · The point (1, 3) corresponds to the point (5, 3) on the transformed line.
     · Each point on the parent function has been shifted 4 units to the right.

     Therefore, we conclude the line representing      appears to have been shifted 4 units to the right from the

     function   .

     EXAMPLE 2

     Use the -intercept to describe how the function                has been transformed from the parent function                 .

     Solution

     We know the shift is 9 units, but we need to consider which direction the -intercept has been moved.

The orange dashed line represents the parent function,              and the solid blue line represents the shifted function.

Carefully looking at the -intercepts, we see the line representing     has been shifted 9 units to the left from

the parent function,             .

Often the horizontal shift is denoted using parentheses to explicitly identify how the values of the independent variable,
or domain, are being changed.

EXAMPLE 3

Describe how the function             is horizontally transformed to   .

Solution

Let's rewrite the equations in point-slope form,                    :

So, the -intercept is         .

So, the -intercept is      .

The -intercept of      starts at      and moves to      , so this represents a shift of 6 units to the right.

We can also check this using graphs.
670  4.11 · Graphing a Function Using Transformations

     Examining the -intercept for                          , on the orange dashed line, we see that  gets shifted 6 units to the

     So, we can identify horizontal shifts using either graphs or algebraic equations.

     Horizontal Transformations of Linear Functions

     Horizontal transformations are the result of altering the input values before applying the function rule. Vertical
     transformations result from altering the output values after the function rule has been applied.

       EXAMPLE 1

     Describe how  is transformed into                 .

     Solution

     First, graph the given function, , the parent linear function.

     Now, let's examine an input value of              using .

     · For the parent function , all points on the line are represented by  .

     · So, when    , then             becomes .

     · That means this point is located at                or    .

     In order to get the same output value for                as we had for , we need to figure out how to change the input
     value.

     · Because our transformed equation is subtracting three from what we input, we have to increase the prior input

          value by 3 units to yield the same output as .

     · The input value that is 3 units larger than            is 5. In the transformed equation, we must use  .

     So, in the original equation where     resulted in            , in the transformed equation, we have to use         in order

     for                              .

Solution

Step 1 - Graph the given function,            .

The -intercept is (0, -3) and the slope is .

For horizontal shifts, it is helpful to identify the -intercept. On our graph, the -intercept or zero is located at (6,0).

Step 2 - Apply the designated transformation. Remember that the rule for a horizontal shift is   . If we rewrite

          in an equivalent form, we can make it is easier to see  .

Step 2 - Apply the designated transformation. Remember that the rule for a horizontal shift is  . And, when the
value of is greater than 1, the function experiences a horizontal compression.

As a result of the horizontal compression, the linear function should look steeper because it is being compressed by a
scale factor of 4.

On our graph, this means the -intercept is compressed from (6, 0) to (1.5, 0).

The orange dashed line is the graph of the original function and the blue solid line is the transformed function.

Using Inequalities to Determine Domain

The domain and range of a function describe the set of possible input values (domain) and output values (range) for that
function. The domain represents the values that can be plugged into the function, Inequalities can be used to represent
the domain. Remember to consider the nature of the function, its properties, and any specific restrictions when
determining the domain using inequalities. Graphing the function can often provide visual clues and help confirm your
analysis.

Use the following information to determine the domain of a function using inequalities:

· Identify any restrictions or limitations on the input variable, usually denoted as .
· Look for values of that could result in undefined or non-existent outputs.
· Common restrictions include square roots of negative numbers, division by zero, or values excluded by the

    function's definition.

Use the following information to express the domain of a function using inequalities:

· Use interval notation or set notation to represent the valid input values for the function.
· Use inequalities to express any restrictions.

For example, if cannot be negative, you would write  or  in interval notation.

Special cases

Consider any specific exclusions or additional conditions mentioned in the function's definition.
For instance, if a function has a denominator and cannot equal certain values, denote those exclusions in the
domain using the notation "  value."

     A graph is yet another way that a relation can be represented. The set of ordered pairs of all the points plotted is the
     relation. The set of all -coordinates, or the input values, is the domain of the relation, and the set of all -coordinates,
     or outputs, is the range.

Using Inequalities to Determine Range

The domain and range of a function describe the set of possible input values (domain) and output values (range) for that
function. The range represents the values that the function can output. Inequalities can be used to represent the range
of a function. Remember to consider the nature of the function, its properties, and any specific restrictions when
determining the range using inequalities. Graphing the function can often provide visual clues to help confirm your
analysis.

Use the following information to determine the range of a function using inequalities:

  · Analyze the behavior and possible output values of the function, usually denoted as .
  · Consider the range of the function based on its graph or algebraic properties.
  · Identify the minimum and maximum possible values that the function can reach.

Use the following information to express the range of a function using inequalities:

  · Use interval notation or set notation to represent the valid output values for the function.
  · Use inequalities to express the minimum and maximum possible values.

For example, if the function's graph never goes below -3 and can reach any positive value, you would write

              as an inequality.

Special cases

Consider any specific exclusions or additional conditions mentioned in the function's definition.

For instance, if a function is taking an absolute value, then the -values will not be negative. So, denote those

exclusions in the range using the notation "  ," or other value as appropriate.

EXAMPLE

Determine the range of this function:         

Since the function is constant and always equal to 3, the range of the function is a single value, which is 3.

Therefore, the range of  ,             is the set {3}.

Domain and Range as Inequalities

Looking at the linear function below, use inequalities to represent the domain and range.

Domain:

Since the domain is all -values, look left to right for the least to greatest values.

The smallest -value on this linear function is 5, and then the line continues to the right forever.

So, the domain is all values that are at least 5.

As an inequality, write this as  .

Range:

Since the range is all -values, look from the bottom to the top for the least to greatest values.

The smallest -value is 0, and then the line continues up forever.

So, the range is all values that are at least 0.

     Finding a Common Ratio

     Definition of a Geometric Sequence
     A geometric sequence is one in which any term divided by the previous term is a constant. This constant is called the
     common ratio of the sequence. The common ratio can be found by dividing any term in the sequence by the previous
     term. If is the initial term of a geometric sequence and is the common ratio, the sequence will be

     {        ,  ,  . . .}

     How to:

     Given a set of numbers, determine if they represent a geometric sequence.

     1. Divide each term by the previous term.
     2. Compare the quotients. If they are the same, a common ratio exists and the sequence is geometric.

        EXAMPLE

     Is the sequence geometric? If so, find the common ratio.

     b. 48, 12, 4, 2, . . .

      a. Is a geometric sequence. Each term is multiplied by 2, so 2 is the common ratio.

     Arithmetic Sequences

     Finding Common Differences

     Companies often make large purchases, such as computers and vehicles, for business use.

       · A woman who starts a small contracting business purchases a new truck for $25,000.
       · After five years, she estimates that she will be able to sell the truck for $8,000. The loss in value of the truck will

           therefore be $17,000, which is $3,400 per year for five years.
       · The truck will be worth $21,600 after the first year; $18,200 after two years; $14,800 after three years; $11,400 after

           four years; and $8,000 at the end of five years.

     The values of the truck in the example are said to form an arithmetic sequence because they change by a constant
     amount each year. Each term increases or decreases by the same constant value called the common difference of the
     sequence. For this sequence, the common difference is -3,400.

     The sequence below is another example of an arithmetic sequence. In this case, the common difference is 3. You can
     choose any term of the sequence and add 3 to find the subsequent term.

     ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE
     An arithmetic sequence is a sequence that has the property that the difference between any two consecutive terms is a
     constant. This constant is called the common difference. If is the first term of an arithmetic sequence and is the

4.17.2 What Is a Recursive Definition?

Activity

The recursive definition is a function that provides a repeated, or recurring, process to find terms in a sequence.

Start with the recursive definition:  ,  and given  .
736  4.17 · Representing Sequences

       · The first part of the recursive definition provides the instructions for how to generate the sequence. It provides the
           function rule or formula for the term.

       · The second part states the domain of the sequence. It describes where we start and the values that are substituted
           into the function.

       · The third part is the basis for the sequence or the smallest term value.

     See the table below for how to substitute to find more terms in the sequence using the recursive definition. Substitute
     the term number, , in for in the recursive definition. Complete the table with a partner.

Writing Recursive Definitions

Sometimes we can define a sequence recursively. That is, we can describe how to calculate the next term in a sequence if
we know the previous term.

Here's a sequence: 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, . . . This is an arithmetic sequence, where each term is 4 more than the previous

term. Since sequences are functions, let's call this sequence . Then we can use function notation to write

                      . Here,        is the term,  is the previous term, and + 4 represents the common difference

since is an arithmetic sequence.
738  4.17 · Representing Sequences

     When we define a function recursively, we must also say what the first term is. Without that, there would be no way of

     knowing if the sequence defined by                           started with 6 or 81 or any other number. Here, one possible

     initial condition is             . It could also make sense to number the terms starting with 0, using       .

     Combining this information gives the recursive definition:         and                               for  , where is an

     integer. We include the          at the end since the value of at 1 is already given, and the other terms in the sequence

     are generated by inputting integers larger than 1 into the definition.

     Let's look at some examples from the first activity and write the recursive definition for each type of sequence:

     EXAMPLE 1

     Sequence A:                      ...

     Step 1 - Determine the type of sequence                                                                   . Now write this
     This sequence is arithmetic.
     Step 2 - Determine the common difference or common ratio
     The terms increase by adding a value of 10, so the common difference is 10.
     Step 3 - Determine the formula or rule
     Since one term's value comes from adding 10 to the term value before it, that means
     rule using function notation.

     Step 4 - Determine the initial condition or basis

     Step 5 - Determine the domain of the formula

     We use the first term to find the second term, so that is where we start at  . So, our domain is          .
                                                                                                                . Now write this
     The recursive definition for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, ... is      ,               ,                    .

     EXAMPLE 2

     Sequence B:                           ...

     Step 1 - Determine the type of sequence                            (since it is divided by 2).
     This sequence is geometric.
     Step 2 - Determine the common difference or common ratio
     The terms are divided by 2 each time, so the common ratio is

     Step 3 - Determine the formula or rule                   to the term value before it, that means

     Since one term's value comes from multiplying
     rule using function notation.

     Step 4 - Determine the initial condition or basis

     Step 5 - Determine the domain of the formula

     We use the first term to find the second term, so that is where we start at  . So, our domain is          .

     The recursive definition for 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, ... is     ,                    ,               .

     Converting from a Recursive Formula to an Explicit Formula for Arithmetic Sequences
     An arithmetic sequence has the following recursive formula:

               ,

     Recall that this formula gives us the following two pieces of information:

     · The first term is 3.
     · To get any term from its previous term, add 2. In other words, the common difference is 2.

     Let's find an explicit formula for the sequence.

     We can represent a sequence whose first term is    and common difference is  with the standard explicit form
                       .

     Therefore, an explicit formula of the sequence is  .

We are given the following term of an arithmetic sequence:

This formula is given in the standard explicit form                 , where is the first term and    is the common

difference. Therefore, the first term of the sequence is 5, and the common difference is 16.

Let's find a recursive formula for the sequence. Recall that the recursive formula gives us two pieces of information:

· The first term, which we know is 5.
· The pattern rule to get any term from the term that comes before it, which we know is "add 16."

Therefore, this is a recursive formula for the sequence:         ,           ,     .

2. Write the recursive formula of                    .

9 is the first term of the sequence, and 8 is the common ratio.

An explicit formula is structured as:  (1st term of sequence) (common ratio)             .

Substitute the values, and you get the explicit formula:                 .

3. Write the term of the geometric sequence where                   and         ,     .

Converting from an Explicit Formula to a Recursive Formula for Geometric Sequences

Finally, geometric sequences represented by the term can be represented with the recursive definition.

Start with the term formula for where                     .

The formula for geometric sequences recursively is                  , where is the common ratio.

The common ratio of the given sequence is 3.

So,     and             ,          .

PROJECT 4: USING FUNCTIONS TO MODEL BATTERY
POWER

Project 4 Overview

In this culminating project, you will use functions to model real-life situations. Both activities in the lesson use the
context of a cell phone's battery power varying over time--either increasing from being charged or decreasing from
being used. The relationships in each activity can be appropriately modeled with linear functions.

In the first activity, you will be given a table of values showing times and percentages of battery power. Study the rates of
change in the table, which are fairly constant, and produce a simple model to make a prediction.

In the second activity, you will analyze images of battery-usage status from a cell phone. To gather the necessary
information, you will need to make sense of the numerical values and the graph on each image. You will also need to
determine how to organize and represent the information before you can use it to create a model.

During this project, you will engage in many aspects of the modeling cycle. You will identify important quantities in a
situation, reason about relationships using representations that you consider useful, analyze the relationships
mathematically to draw conclusions, and reflect on your results in context. Upon gaining new information, you can work
to improve your model.

You might want to collect data from your own electronic devices, or to create presentations to explain your models.

Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for you to choose to use appropriate technology to
solve problems.

 2. Analyze Percent Charge Over Time
 3. Write an Equation to Model Data

Learning Targets

When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:

 1. Use functions to model real-life situations and make predictions.

Estimate Time to Charge a Battery

      For this project, think about an electronic device with a battery that you have to charge on a regular basis.
 1. What device is it?
 2. When you are using the device, approximately how long does it take the battery to go from 100% charged until the

      time you need to plug it in again to recharge?
 3. Approximately how long does it take to charge to 100% starting from 0% or nearly 0%?
 4. Approximately how long does it take to charge if you plugged in your device when the battery was 50% charged?
 5. How long do you think it would take to recharge the device to 100% from 50% compared to the time it would take if

      the device was at 0%? Would it be exactly half the time, more than half the time, or less than half the time it would
      take if starting from 0%?

Analyze Percent Charge Over Time

      A cell phone is plugged in to be charged. The table below shows the percent of battery power at a few times
      after it was plugged in. Use the data to find out. Be prepared to show your reasoning.

      1. At what time will the battery be 100% charged?

     Write an Equation to Model Data

     For questions 1 - 2 , use the following prompt and image.
           The image shows the battery usage of a cell phone 9 hours after it was fully charged. It also shows a prediction
           that the battery would last 8 more hours.

      1. Write an equation for a model that fits the data in the image and gives the percent of battery power as a function of
           time since the phone was fully charged. Be prepared to show your reasoning.

      2. Based on your function, what percentage of power would the battery have 4 hours after this image was taken?

     Unit 4 Wrap Up

     Throughout this unit, you learned that Supratim Das can use functions to help him produce longer-lasting batteries that
     can be used in mobile devices and electric cars. He can analyze energy inputs and outputs using functions and their
     graphs.

     In this unit, you learned how to identify functions and how to use function notation to name a function and to specify its
     input and output. You learned that each point on the graph of a function represents an input-output pair of the function.
     You learned that function notation can be used to find the rule of a function and that the rule can be used to find the
     output for any input. You learned that a function is linear if the output changes by a constant rate relative to its input.

     You related features of graphs of functions using terms such as "intercept," "maximum," "minimum," and "slope." You
     used statements in function notation to talk about key features of a graph. You learned that the average rate of change
     can be used to measure how fast a function changes over an interval. You compared several functions relating the same
     pair of quantities and analyzed two or more graphs, interpreting their relative features. You compared key features of
     graphs and interpreted them in context.

     You related possible input and output values to domain and range. You determined a reasonable domain and range for
     a function based on the context.

     Finally, you learned that a sequence is defined as a list of numbers, and the term (of a sequence) is one of the numbers
     in the list. You learned that the terms of a geometric sequence change by the same factor, called the common ratio. An
     arithmetic sequence is characterized by adding a constant value to get from one term to the other. One formula for a
     sequence, called a recursive formula, identifies the first term and the common difference or common ratio to identify the
     terms of the sequence. Another formula, called an term formula or explicit formula, is one where the value of the
     term is determined from just the term number.

Unit 5 Overview

Overview: Why Should I Care?

Do you know what financial inclusion and dignity is? Watch the video to learn a bit about how Operation Hope uses
exponential functions to help underserved populations take part in the economy and achieve financial security.

Access multimedia content (http://openstax.org/books/algebra-1/pages/5-unit-5-overview)
In this unit, you will learn about exponential functions and models. Understanding exponential functions and models
can help you with financial planning, whether you want to know how much interest you will pay on a credit card balance,
how much interest you will earn on your savings account, or how much a stock fund has grown in value over the past 10
years.

Building Character: Grit

Through coaching, John Hope Bryan, owner of Operation Hope, equips young people and adults with the financial tools
and education to secure a better future. He coaches them through their personal aspirations and life's challenges and
facilitates their journey to financial independence. Similarly, you will need to present passion and perseverance to work
through this course to ultimately achieve your long-term goals, just as John's organization helps others achieve their
long-term financial goals. This unit is the midpoint of the course. Through grit, you will be able to keep working toward
your goal, and you will uncover that exponential functions and models can help with long-term planning.

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your grit. Grit is passion and perseverance to reach long-term goals.
Excellence sometimes seems like the result of natural talent. But no matter how gifted you are--no matter how easily
you climb up the learning curve--you do need to do that climbing. There are no shortcuts. Grit predicts accomplishing
challenging goals of personal significance. For example, grittier students are more likely to graduate from high school,
and grittier cadets are more likely to complete their training at West Point. Notably, in most research studies, grit and
measures of talent and IQ are unrelated, suggesting that talent puts no limits on the capacity for passion and
perseverance.

Think about your current sense of grit. How many of the following statements are true for you?

  · I enjoy projects that take years to complete.
  · I am working toward a very long-term goal.
  · What I do each day is connected to my deepest personal values.
  · There is at least one subject or activity that I never get bored of thinking about.
  · Setbacks don't discourage me for long.
  · I am a hard worker.
  · I finish whatever I begin.
  · I never stop working to improve.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Am I Ready to Learn This?

Interpret Linear Functions

A linear function is a function that represents a line on the coordinate plane. A line can be written in slope-intercept

form,          , where is the slope and is the -intercept. The dependent variable is , and the independent

variable is . The can be replaced by , so the function can be written as           .

Andrei wants to fill a glass tank with marbles, each with the same volume, and then fill the remaining space with water.

The function            represents the volume of water, in liters, Andrei uses if he uses marbles.

You can rewrite the function in slope-intercept form:          . The slope is -0.05, and the -intercept is 32.

1. What is the volume of the tank?

                        represents the volume left in the tank after marbles were added. The volume of the tank is

the initial volume before any of the marbles have been added, or .                              . The volume of

the tank is 32 liters.

2. What is the volume of each marble?

The volume of water needed to fill the tank decreases by 0.05 liters each time Andrei puts in a marble, . This means
that the volume of each marble is 0.05 liters.

     We saw that the Quotient Property for Exponents has two forms depending on whether the exponent is larger in the

5.3.0 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will encounter two different growth patterns. You will think about and compare the patterns by

performing calculations and using graphs. This lesson contains many opportunities for you to notice and make use of

structure, for example, noticing that                               can be expressed as  .

You will examine two types of patterns by looking at tables, noting that one type is characterized by common differences
and the other by common ratios. Then you will match different representations with two contexts. This is an opportunity
for you to notice structure in expressions.

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

· Compare growth patterns using calculations and graphs.
· Use words and expressions to describe patterns in tables of values.
· Write expressions and create tables of values to represent them using descriptions of linear and exponential

    relationships.

When determining growth, there are a few ways to check. When given a table, you could graph each, or you could check
the rate of change. Linear functions have a constant rate of change, where consecutive terms have a common
difference. The common difference is a value that is added to or subtracted from consecutive terms to find the next
term. Exponential functions have a constant ratio or common multiplier. The constant ratio is a value that is multiplied
or divided from consecutive terms to find the next term.

  · Table A is linear and has a slope of 8 since the change in is 8 and the change in is 1.
  · Table B is also linear because the change in is 16 and the change in is 2 for a slope of 8.
  · Table C is an example of an exponential function. There is a common ratio instead of a common difference. Notice

      that each -term is 4 times the previous term. Therefore, the common ratio is 4.
  · Table D is also linear with a common difference of 4.

Table C is the only exponential function. Therefore, it has a different growth pattern since Tables A, B, and D are linear.

                                         number of stores 5 25 45 65 85 105

     To determine which options go with which scenario, you first need to analyze each scenario.

     Let's look at Plan A.

     · Plan A is to open 20 new stores each year for a food company that currently has 5 convenience stores. In both

         scenarios, the initial value or starting point is 5 stores, which is why in each table the first value is  . If they are

         opening 20 additional stores each year, they are adding 20 stores to the total from the previous year. So in year 1

         there would be 25 total stores, in year 2 there would be 45 total stores, and so on. These values are represented in

         option 6, so option 6 would represent Plan A.

     · The mathematical expressions contain either multiplication or addition. Plan A is ADDING 20 stores a year, so year 5

         could be represented as option 1 because it would be the initial number of stores plus 20 per year for 5 years, or

                                      .

     · Option 5 is also added, and represents Plan A since                              is the same as              .

     Let's look at Plan B.

     · Plan B would also start at 5, but it says to double the number of stores each year. Double means to MULTIPLY by 2,

         so it would be               , which is option 3.

     · Since                   can be simplified to , option 2 also represents Plan B.

     · Option 4 is the other table option, and as mentioned before, each table should have an initial value of 5 stores.

      Since Plan B is to double the number of stores, at the end of year 1 there should be 10 stores. When you check
      option 4, you can see that each term is double the term before.
Therefore, Plan A is options 1, 5, and 6, and Plan B is options 2, 3, and 4.

     Extending Your Thinking

     We know, for example, that                                  and          . The grouping with parentheses does not

     affect the value of the expression.

     Is this true for exponents? That is, are the numbers             and    equal? If not, which is bigger?

     Which of the two would you choose as the meaning of the expression written without parentheses?

     Self Check

     Santos and Sara are checking their work on the following problem:        .

     Santos says the answer is 1. Sara says the answer is 4. Who is correct, and why?

         a. Sara is correct because you first would simplify the parenthesis, and since it's raised to the zero power, it would
              be 1. Then you would multiply that by 4, for a final answer of 4.

         b. Both Santos and Sara are correct since there are two methods to solve the problem.
         c. Neither Santos nor Sara did the problem correctly.
         d. Santos is correct because anything raised to the zero power is 1.

     Why is      and      , but             is not the same as ?

     Answering this question will help us understand the zero exponent rule.

     Exponents in general represent repeated multiplication, much like multiplication represents repeated addition. Let's use
     that understanding to evaluate and :

     8 and 125 are obviously very different, but the method to get to each answer was the same. If we rewrite it as a table, we
     can work backward to understand how and are both 1.

     Using       and filling in the parts we have found results in Table 1:

                                                                 0123

     Repeating that process for             results in Table 2:

                                             5 25 125

Since exponents represent repeated multiplication in both tables, additional terms are found by multiplying again by the
base. What if we worked backward? If you multiply to move to the right in the table, you can divide by the common ratio
to work backward. Start with the 8, and work backward to fill in the table:

                                    0                1         2  3

                                                                  8

Repeat the process for Table 2:

                                 0                1            2     3

                                                                     125

After you have worked backward in each table, you will see that and both equal 1. When 1 is the exponent, your
answer is the same as the common ratio, so when you divide by the common ratio, you end up with 1 as your answer
every time. This is an important rule that can save a lot of time.

Defining Exponential Growth

Because the output of exponential functions increases very rapidly, the term "exponential growth" is often used in
everyday language to describe anything that grows or increases rapidly. However, exponential growth can be defined
more precisely in a mathematical sense. If the growth rate is proportional to the amount present, the function models
exponential growth.

EXPONENTIAL GROWTH

A function that models exponential growth grows by a rate proportional to the amount present. For any real number

and any positive real numbers and such that  , an exponential growth function has the form

where

  · is the initial or starting value of the function.
  · is the growth factor or growth multiplier per unit .

The initial or starting value of the function is 4, because that is when the value of is 0.
The constant ratio, , would be 3, since every value in the table is 3 times the previous term.

An asymptote is a line or curve that a function approaches but does not intersect or touch. In other words, as the input
values of a function approach a certain value or tend towards infinity or negative infinity, the function values get
arbitrarily close to the asymptote without actually crossing it. Asymptotes can provide valuable information about the
behavior of a function and can help in understanding its limits and range.

Since equation  represents an exponential function, we determine the asymptote of this function by considering

the behavior of the function as approaches positive or negative infinity.

As approaches positive infinity, the values of will grow exponentially larger. There is no upper bound, and the
function increases without bound as increases. Therefore, there is no horizontal asymptote in the positive direction.

Similarly, as approaches negative infinity, the values of will become very small but never reach zero. In this case,
there is also no horizontal asymptote in the negative direction.

Therefore, the function  does not have a horizontal asymptote in either direction. The graph of the function will

continue to increase, continue off the coordinate plane, indefinitely as increases or decreases.

4. Write an equation to represent the population of ants, , after

When you are analyzing exponential decay and are given the fraction or percent by which it decreases, you need to

remember that one minus that fraction or percent is the growth rate. In the case of the ant colony, because it is

decreasing by , that means that the growth factor is       or .

Part 1 asks for an expression to represent the ant population at the end of April. There are several options:

Basically, you take the answer from April and multiply by
taking the initial value times twice.

Part 3 asks you to extend the pattern to 6 months after the initial population was measured. After the month, you

multiplied the initial value by the growth factor twice, so for this situation you would need to multiply the initial value by

the growth factor 6 times, or raise it to the sixth power. The possible answers would be                       or

, which means that after 6 months the population would be about 1,311.

A population of migrating butterflies satisfies the equation
they began their migration.

Answer the following questions that would complete the table and create a graph to show the population of migrating
butterflies at the number of weeks since they began their migration.

    01234

1. The number of butterflies when they began their migration.
2. The number of butterflies 1 week after they began their migration.
3. The number of butterflies 3 weeks after they began their migration.
4. Create a graph that best represents the butterfly population.
830  5.5 · Representing Exponential Decay

     5. What is the vertical intercept, or -intercept, of the graph? What does it tell you about the butterfly population?
     6. When does the butterfly population reach approximately 50,000?
     7. What is the asymptote of the graph? What does it tell you about the butterfly population over time?

     When you have the equation that represents the situation, you can substitute values in and use the order of operations
     to find the values for the table.

     · Part 1 is asking for the initial value. Since the equation            is in the form  , you know the

         initial value is or 100,000.
     · Part 2 is 1 week after migration, so replace the in the equation with 1 to get 80,000.
     · In part 3, the can be replaced with 3 to get 51,200.
     · The rest of the values of the table can be found the same way, and once you have the completed table, you can plot

         the points. Once you have plotted the points, you can connect them with a smooth curve.

                                           0  1                        2  3  4

     · Part 5 asks about the vertical intercept and what it means. The vertical intercept is 100,000, which is the initial

     amount of the butterfly population. This means that when the butterflies start their migration (at     weeks), the

     population is initially 100,000.

     The -intercept is the value of when      , which corresponds to the initial condition or starting point of the

     migration. Substituting               into the equation, we have                                    .

     · For part 6, you could continue the table or use the graph to see where it is 50,000, which is around 3 weeks.

· For part 7, an asymptote is a line or curve that a function approaches but does not intersect or touch. In other
    words, as the input values of a function approach a certain value or tend towards infinity or negative infinity, the
    function values get arbitrarily close to the asymptote without actually crossing it. Asymptotes can provide valuable
    information about the behavior of a function and can help in understanding its limits and range.

To determine the asymptote, we examine the behavior of the function as  approaches infinity. In this case, as 

becomes larger and larger, the term  will grow exponentially smaller. Consequently, the population  will also

grow infinitely smaller as it gets closer and closer to zero. Thus, the horizontal asymptote in this equation is the

-axis. The graph of the function will continue to decrease towards the -axis as  increases, approaching               .

The butterfly population will decrease over time due to the migration.

The graph shows the amount of a chemical in a patient's body at different times, measured in hours since the levels were
first checked.
Could the amount of this chemical in the patient be decaying exponentially? Explain how you know.

The graph does seem to have the shape of exponential decay. To confirm if the chemical in the patient is decaying
exponentially, you can find the growth factor. Since terms are usually multiplied by the growth factor, you can divide
consecutive terms to see if there is the same growth factor each time.

Since             , the growth factor is . Therefore, it is decaying exponentially, and the equation is
       , where is the amount of chemical in mg in the patient and is the time in hours.

As the time continues, the amount of chemical in the patient is approaching 0 mg. We can see this in the graph as the

       NOTATION

5.6.0 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will examine the meaning of negative exponents in the context of exponential growth and decay.
Using data in a table, you will write equations and answer questions, some of which require working with negative
values representing time. In one case, you will also produce a graph. As with many other activities in this unit, the
mathematical work is grounded and interpreted in a context. These equations with negative exponents are frequently
used in solving real-world problems where estimates are taken, including population sizes, financial calculations, and
many other scientific measurements.

You will learn to convert numbers fluently between decimal form and scientific notation. This will allow you to easily
perform operations on and represent large and small values in any context. Scientific notation is an extremely valuable
tool for representing very large and small numbers that frequently occur as scientists take real-world measurements.

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

  · Describe the meaning of a negative exponent in equations that represent exponential growth and decay.
  · Write equations that represent exponential growth and decay to solve problems.
  · Graph an equation that represents exponential decay to solve a problem.

Using Scientific Notation

Working with very large or very small numbers can be awkward. Since our number system is base ten, we can use
powers of ten to rewrite very large or very small numbers to make them easier to work with. Consider the numbers
4,000 and 0.004.

Using place value, we can rewrite the numbers 4,000 and 0.004. We know that 4,000 means                  and 0.004 means
             .

If we write the 1,000 as a power of ten in exponential form, we can rewrite these numbers in this way:
4,000

0.004

When a number is written as a product of two numbers, where the first factor is a number greater than or equal to 1 but
less than 10, and the second factor is a power of 10 written in exponential form, it is said to be in scientific notation.

A number is expressed in scientific notation when it is in this form :

       , where                 and is an integer.

It is customary in scientific notation to use × as the multiplication sign, even though we avoid using this sign elsewhere
in algebra.

To convert a decimal to scientific notation:

Step 1. Move the decimal point so that the first factor is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10.

Step 2. Count the number of decimal places, , that the decimal point was moved.

Step 3. Write the number as a product with a power of 10. If the original number is

· greater than 1, the power of 10 will be .

· between 0 and 1, the power of 10 will be         .

Step 4. Check.

     2. Which graph has the smallest value for ?
     3. Which graph has the largest value for ?
     4. Which graph has the smallest value for ?

     When using the form              , it is important to remember that is the initial value, or the -intercept, and is the

     growth factor. The growth factor reflects an exponential growth function when the value is greater than one. The growth

     factor reflects an exponential decay function when the value is between zero and one.

     For question 1, you are looking for the largest growth factor, which would mean an exponential growth function that is
     increasing the most rapidly. First, identify the graphs that reflect exponential growth, which would be D, E, and F, and
     then decide which is the steepest. Graph D increases much faster than both graphs E and F.

     For question 2, you are looking for the steepest rate of exponential decay, so you need the graph that has the smallest
      -value. The graphs that reflect exponential decay are graphs A, B, and C. The graph that has a -value that is closest to 0

     is graph C. Graph C has the steepest exponential decay because its -value is the closest to 0 and, therefore, the
     smallest.

     For question 3, you are looking for the largest initial value or -intercept. This could be with a growth or decay function;
     it just needs to cross the -axis higher than the other graphs. Graph C has the highest value.

     For question 4, you are looking for the smallest initial value or -intercept. This could be a growth or decay function; it

Situation 2: Loggerhead turtles reproduce every 2 to 4 years, laying approximately 120 eggs in a clutch. Using this

information, we can derive an approximate equation to model the turtle population. As is often the case in biological

studies, we will count only the female turtles. If we start with a population of one female turtle in a protected area and

assume that all turtles survive, we can roughly approximate the population of female turtles by  .

Since each graph represents exponential growth, and they both have the same labels, you have to look more closely at
each. The biggest difference is the -intercept or initial value. Graph 1 has an initial value of 100, and Graph 2 has a very
small initial value. When you reread the situations, you can see that Situation 1 starts with 100 bacteria, and Situation 2
starts with 1 female turtle. This helps you see that Situation 1 belongs to Graph 1 and Situation 2 belongs to Graph 2.

In this lesson, you start to view situations characterized by exponential change using descriptions, tables, and graphs as
exponential functions. This means choosing an independent and dependent variable and expressing the relationships
using function language and, in some cases, function notation. You use variables to represent one real-world quantity as
a function of another, which is an example of decontextualizing and reasoning abstractly.

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

5.10 LOOKING AT RATES OF CHANGE

5.10.0 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will revisit the idea of average rate of change and apply it to exponential functions. While rate of
change has an unambiguous meaning for linear functions, for nonlinear functions rates of change are not constant, so
an interval must be specified.

In this lesson, you are first invited to recall how to calculate an average rate of change for a specific interval for a
function represented by a data table. You then consider the average rate of change for an exponential function
describing the increase in the number of coffee shops for a business. By comparing the average rate of change of
different intervals that all start at the same point, you will observe that while the average rate of change can describe
how the data are changing with reasonable accuracy over some intervals, it is not a good predictor over larger intervals
since exponential functions do not have a constant rate of change. In the last activity, you use the average rate of change
to describe how the cost of producing 1 watt from a solar cell decreases in two separate intervals, which illuminates the
nature of exponential decay to decrease at a slower rate. Contexts are used throughout this lesson to give you an
opportunity to reason abstractly and quantitatively.

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

  · Calculate the average rate of change of a function over a specified period of time.
  · Recognize how the average rate of change of an exponential function differs from that of a linear function.

Here are the activities that will help you reach those goals:

dollars, of producing 1 watt of solar energy from 1977 to 1988, where is years since 1977.

1. Clare said, "In the first five years, between 1977 and 1982, the cost fell by about $12 per year. But in the second five
     years, between 1983 and 1988, the cost fell only by about $2 a year." Show that Clare is correct.

2. If the trend continues, will the average decrease in price be more or less than $2 per year between 1987 and 1992?

                                      200 100 50 25

The formula for exponential decay is  where a is the starting value and is the amount that value
decreases each unit of time .

The pattern for the decay is starting at 200 and then decreasing by 12 with only 12 remaining. The equation is

            or                    .

     In each situation, the inputs or -values are increasing by 1 each time. These can also be called consecutive terms.
     If you have consecutive terms, then:

       · If the difference between their corresponding outputs or -values is always the same constant, then the input-
           output pairs in the table can be modeled by a linear function.

       · If the quotient between their corresponding outputs or -values is always the same constant, then the input-output
           pairs in the table can be modeled by an exponential function. A growth rate greater than one means that it is
           exponential growth, and a growth rate between zero and one means that it is exponential decay.

     It is possible for a table to be a set of values that is not any of these relationships.

     Using this information, you can see that in Table A,  . This holds true for the quotient of every other set of

     consecutive terms, too. Since the quotient is always the same, Table A represents an exponential function. Since the
     growth rate is , or between zero and one, Table A represents exponential decay.

     In Table B, the quotient of consecutive terms is not the same, but there is a common difference. The difference between

     the first two terms is             . This holds true for each of the other pairs of consecutive terms, so Table B

     represents a linear relationship.

     In Table C, the quotient of consecutive terms is      . This relationship holds true for all of the pairs of consecutive

     terms, which means this table represents an exponential relationship. Since the growth factor is greater than one, Table
     C represents exponential growth.

Let's first think about linear and exponential functions in general. Let's also consider Options A and B when represents

the bushels of apples picked and  represents the total amount she earns based on bushels of apples.

1. Since Option A is $1.50 per bushel picked, it is linear. For Option B, the amount of money is tripling for each bushel
     picked, so it is exponential.

. Think back to the lessons on the slope or rate of change of a linear function. The numerator was always the

change in or output, which is the same as the change in . Notice that all the changes in consecutive terms are the

same, 4. This means that there is a constant rate of change and this particular function is linear.

Since this function is linear, an equation will have the form                                        . The rate of change

is 4. The initial value is the same as the -intercept, or where  .  would be 4 less than the first term listed in this

Extending Your Thinking
For integer inputs, we can think of multiplication as repeated addition and exponentiation as repeated multiplication:

        Multiplication representing repeated addition Exponentiation representing repeated multiplication

We could continue this process with a new operation called tetration. It uses the symbol  , and it is defined as repeated
exponentiation:

PROJECT 5: INTRODUCTION TO EXPONENTIAL
FUNCTIONS

Project 5 Overview

In this project, you will use the main function types you have studied thus far in the course (linear and exponential) to
model different populations. In the first activity, data for three city populations will be given and you will be asked to
produce a linear or exponential model for each (if appropriate) and then make predictions for populations at other
dates.

In the second activity, you will examine the world population. The task is more open-ended and only limited data is
provided, likely requiring you to gather more data.

Throughout the project, you will engage in different parts of the modeling cycle. Be careful - you will have to think
carefully about how to choose an appropriate linear or exponential model.

Project Activities

 1. Analyze Data
 2. Writing Equations to Model Populations
 3. Open-ended Modeling with Data Investigation

Learning Targets

When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:

  · Determine how well a chosen model fits the given information.
  · Determine whether to use a linear function or an exponential function to model real-world data.

     2050?

2. How would you describe the population change in each city during this time period? Write one to two sentences for
     each city. Then discuss with your group.

      3. What kind of model (linear, exponential, both, or neither) do you think is appropriate for each city's population?
      4. For each population that you think can be modeled by a linear and/or exponential function:

            a. Write an equation for the function(s).
            b. Graph the function(s).

      5. Compare the graphs of your functions with the actual population data. How well do the models fit the data?

     Unit 5 Wrap Up

     Throughout this unit, you learned that Operation Hope founder John Hope Bryant helped underserved populations
     become part of the economy and work toward financial freedom. Teaching people about finance charges and the growth
     of investments involves looking at exponential models and comparing rates of change.
     Similarly, in this unit, you learned about exponential relationships. You learned that in an exponential relationship, the y
     values are being multiplied by the same number called the growth factor. You learned that exponential growth functions
     increase as x increases and exponential decay functions decrease as x increases.
     You also learned to identify key features of exponential graphs and to interpret graphs related to real world contexts.
     Finally, you compared exponential functions to linear functions. While linear functions have a constant rate of change,
     exponential functions use the average rate of change over different intervals to describe how the data is changing. You
     compared linear growth to exponential growth using tables and graphs to verify that exponential functions eventually
     overtake the linear function.

Unit 6 Overview

Why Should I Care?

Do you think you would want to open your own business someday? Watch the video to learn a bit about how Ozzy
Gamez and Juan Quezada opened the Plant Shop Chicago and how they can use polynomials to make sure the business
is successful.

Access multimedia content (http://openstax.org/books/algebra-1/pages/6-unit-6-overview)
In this unit, you will learn about polynomials. Understanding how to perform operations with polynomials can help you
plan a budget for the school fundraiser so you can decide the best price to charge for the products and how to account
for the shipping costs.

Building Character: Judgment

Ozzy Gamez grew up in Belize, and Juan Quezada grew up in Mexico. However, they had a mutual love of plants. Ozzy
and Juan turned their love of plants into a thriving business. Plant Shop Chicago opened its doors in 2021 with the goal
of growing the plant community. It takes hard work, planning, and a keen sense of judgment to grow a successful
business. Plant Shop Chicago uses digital tools to make the business run efficiently. They could use polynomials to plan
their revenue and costs so they can make a profit.

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your judgment. We expect good judgment from doctors when they
are treating us, teachers when they are grading assignments, and employers when they are reviewing resumes. A key
factor in making sound judgements is not jumping to conclusions. Your judgment will never be perfect, but you can
strive to be aware of bias and make corrections when necessary.

Think about yourself. When you face a problem that requires judgment, how many of these things are true?

  · I try not to jump to conclusions.
  · I am aware that this is a matter of judgment: I ask myself what someone I trust would think of this problem.
  · I independently ask several people for their judgment, and I consider their reasons.
  · I try to separate my hopes and fears from the facts and beliefs supporting the judgment.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Am I Ready to Learn This?

UNIT 6 INQUIRY PROJECT: AREA MODEL
MULTIPLICATION

Inquiry Project Overview

In this project, you will revisit using an area model as a tool for finding products. You will start with a numerical area
model, focusing on two-digit numbers and reviewing that you can partition a rectangle into smaller areas whose sum is
the total area of the rectangle. Then, you will then apply this area model to algebraic expressions where an area model
can be used to multiply polynomials. First, you will be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play
time allows for you to learn how to use a simulation for learning and discover how to interact with it. You will have an
opportunity to share how you used the simulation during the open play time. Be sure you are aware of the controls and
how to use the simulation.

When you engage with the activity sheet, you should be pausing to discuss some of your responses with a partner. Be
prepared to stop and share your individual responses and partner discussions with the whole class. By the end of the
lesson, you should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to use an area model to
multiply two two-digit numbers or two polynomials, and explain why an area model can be used to find the product of
two factors.

Adding and Subtracting Monomials

We have learned how to simplify expressions by combining like terms. Remember, like terms must have the same
variables with the same exponent. Since monomials are terms, adding and subtracting monomials is the same as
combining like terms. If the monomials are like terms, we just combine them by adding or subtracting the coefficients.
Remember that like terms must have the same variables with the same exponents.
These terms have the same variables and the same exponents:

  ·
So we can add the monomials:

  ·
The variables and exponents of the monomials do not change when we add or subtract them.

     Adding and Subtracting Polynomials

     We can think of adding and subtracting polynomials as just adding and subtracting a series of monomials. Look for the
     like terms--those with the same variables and the same exponent. The Commutative Property allows us to rearrange the
     terms to put like terms together.

     Building Character: Judgement

     A key factor in making sound judgements is not jumping to conclusions. Your judgment will never be perfect, but you
     can strive to be aware of bias and make corrections when necessary.

     Think about yourself. When you face a problem that requires judgment, how many of these things are true?

       · I independently ask several people for their judgment, and I consider their reasons.
       · I try to separate my hopes and fears from the facts and beliefs supporting the judgment.

     Multiplying Binomials Using the Distributive Property

     Just like there are different ways to represent multiplication of numbers, there are several different ways to represent
     how to multiply a binomial times a binomial using the Distributive Property of Multiplication over Addition.

     Distribute to multiply the binomials.

       EXAMPLE 1

     Step 1 - Distribute the binomial  .

     Step 2 - Now, distribute the individual terms.
     Step 3 - Combine like terms.

       EXAMPLE 2

     Step 1 - Distribute the binomial           .

     Step 2 - Distribute the individual terms.

     Step 3 - Combine like terms.

     Multiplying Binomials Using the FOIL Method

     If you multiply binomials often enough, you may notice a pattern. Notice that the first term in the result is the product of
     the first terms in each binomial. The second and third terms are the product of multiplying the two outer terms and
     then the two inner terms. And the last term results from multiplying the two last terms.

     We abbreviate "First, Outer, Inner, Last" as FOIL. The letters stand for "First, Outer, Inner, Last." We use this as another
     way to multiply binomials. The word FOIL is easy to remember and ensures we find all four products.

     Let's multiply                   using both methods.

We summarize the steps of the FOIL method below. The FOIL method only applies to multiplying binomials, not other
polynomials!

  How to use the FOIL method to multiply two binomials:

  Step 1 - Multiply the First terms.
  Step 2 - Multiply the Outer terms.
  Step 3 - Multiply the Inner terms.
  Step 4 - Multiply the Last terms.
  Step 5 - Combine like terms, when possible.

When you multiply by the FOIL method, drawing the arrows will help your brain focus on the pattern and make it easier
to apply.

The FOIL method is usually the quickest method for multiplying two binomials, but it only works for binomials. You can
use the Distributive Property to find the product of any two polynomials.

Multiplying Binomials Using Vertical Alignment

Another representation that works for all polynomials is Vertical Alignment. It is much like the method you use to
multiply whole numbers. Look carefully at this example of multiplying two-digit numbers.

Start by multiplying 23 by 6 to get 138.
Next, multiply 23 by 4, lining up the partial product in the correct columns.
Use a 0 as a place holder in the ones column because you will be multiplying by 4 tens.
Finally, add the partial products.

  EXAMPLE 5

Multiply using Vertical Alignment:  . It does not matter which binomial goes on the top.

Step 1 - Multiply         by .

Step 2 - Multiply         by .

Step 3 - Add like terms.

Notice the partial products are the same as the terms in the FOIL method.

We have now used three ways to multiply binomials. Be sure to practice each process, and try to decide which one you
prefer.

Multiplying Binomial Squares

Mathematicians like to look for patterns that will make their work easier. A good example of this is squaring binomials.
While you can always get the product by writing the binomial twice and multiplying the two binomials, there is less work
to do if you learn to use a pattern. Let's start by looking at three examples and look for a pattern.
Look at these results. Do you see any patterns?
994  6.2 · Multiplying Polynomials

     What about the number of terms? In each example, we squared a binomial, and the result was a trinomial.

     Now look at the first term in each result. Where did it come from?
     The first term is the product of the first terms of each binomial. Since the binomials are identical, it is just the square of
     the first term!

     To get the first term of the product, square the first term.
     Where did the last term come from? Look at the examples and find the pattern.
     The last term is the product of the last terms, which is the square of the last term.

     To get the last term of the product, square the last term.
     Finally, look at the middle term. Notice it came from adding the "outer" and the "inner" terms--which are the same! So
     the middle term is double the product of the two terms of the binomial.

     To get the middle term of the product, multiply the terms and double their product.
     Putting it all together:

Conjugate Pairs

We just saw a pattern for squaring binomials that we can use to make multiplying some binomials easier. Similarly, there
is a pattern for another product of binomials.

A pair of binomials that each have the same first term and the same last term, but one is a sum and one is a difference,

is called a conjugate pair and is of the form    ,  .

CONJUGATE PAIR

A conjugate pair is two binomials of the form

The pair of binomials each have the same first term and the same last term, but one binomial is a sum and the other is a
difference.

There is a nice pattern for finding the product of conjugates. You could, of course, simply FOIL to get the product, but
using the pattern makes your work easier. Let's look for the pattern by using FOIL to multiply some conjugate pairs.

What do you observe about the products?

The product of the two binomials is also a binomial! Most of the products resulting from FOIL have been trinomials.

Each first term is the product of the first terms of the binomials, and since they are identical, it is the square of the first
term.

To get the first term, square the first term.
The last term came from multiplying the last terms, and it is the square of the last term.

To get the last term, square the last term.

Why is there no middle term? Notice the two middle terms you get from FOIL combine to 0 in every case, the result of
one addition and one subtraction.

The product of conjugates is always of the form     . This is called a difference of squares.

This leads to the pattern:

PRODUCT OF CONJUGATES PATTERN

If a and b are real numbers,

We just developed special product patterns for Binomial Squares and for the Product of Conjugates. The products look
similar, so it is important to recognize when it is appropriate to use each of these patterns and to notice how they differ.
Look at the two patterns together and note their similarities and differences.

6.3.1 Dividing by Monomials

Warm Up

Look at the division expression                       .

1. Rewrite the division expression as a fraction.           2. Since we have a monomial divided by a monomial,
                                                                we can rewrite the fraction as a product of several
                                                                fractions where the factors in the numerator and
                                                                denominator "match."

3. Now we can simplify the fraction multiplication and
    use the Quotient Property to divide.

For questions 4 - 6, divide a polynomial by a monomial. Divide each term of the polynomial by the monomial.

      Dividing Polynomials Using Synthetic Division

      Mathematicians like to find patterns to make their work easier. Since long division can be tedious, let's look back at the
      long division we did in a previous example and look for some patterns. We will use this as a basis for what is called
      synthetic division. The same problem in the synthetic division format is shown next.

      Synthetic division basically just removes unnecessary repeated variables and numbers. Here, all the and are

      removed as well as the           and  because they are opposite the term above.

      The first row of the synthetic division is the coefficients of the dividend. The is the opposite of the in the divisor.

      The second row of the synthetic division is the numbers shown in red in the division problem.

      The third row of the synthetic division is the numbers shown in blue in the division problem.

      Notice the quotient and remainder are shown in the third row.

      Synthetic division only works when the divisor is of the form   .

      The following example will explain the process.

Step 4 - Bring down the first coefficient to the third row.

Step 5 - Multiply that coefficient by the divisor and place the result in the second row under the second coefficient.

Step 6 - Add the second column, putting the result in the third row.

Step 7 - Multiply that result by the divisor and place the result in the second row under the third coefficient.

6.3.5 Using the Factor Theorem

Cool Down

In all the division problems we completed that had a remainder of zero, we say that the divisor was a factor of the
dividend.

Whenever a divisor,   , divides a polynomial function, , and results in a remainder of zero, we say      is a factor
of .

This leads us to the Factor Theorem.

Activity

For the first part of the activity, you will work with a partner. Your teacher will hand out two pieces of paper, one to each
of you. It is important for the activity that you do not show your partner your paper.

1. When you receive your paper, look at your expression. Write down all of the factors in your expression.

For example, if your expression was        , you would write down  . Do not share these factors with
your partner yet.

2. When you and your partner have finished finding the factors of your expression, you will try to determine the GCF of
1020  6.4 · Greatest Common Factor and Factor by Grouping

           these two terms without actually knowing the other's expression! Take turns with your partner sharing one factor
           and the quantity of that factor. For example, you could say, "My expression has two factors that are 5" or "My
           expression has three factors that are ." Write down the factors your partner has shared with you.
      3. Once you and your partner have finished taking turns sharing factors, you should know all of the factors in your
           partner's expression. Using this information, determine your partner's expression and find the GCF of these two
           expressions. Once you have found the GCF, compare your answer with your partner's. Did you have the same

      Factoring the GCF from Polynomials

      It is sometimes useful to represent a number as a product of factors, for example, 12 as or . In algebra, it can also

      be useful to represent a polynomial in factored form. We will start with a product, such as    , and end with its

      factors,    . To do this, we apply the Distributive Property "in reverse." We state the Distributive Property here just

      as you saw it in earlier chapters and "in reverse."

      DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY

      If , , and are real numbers, then
                                           and

      The form on the left is used to multiply. The form on the right is used to factor.

      So how do you use the Distributive Property to factor a polynomial? You just find the GCF of all the terms and write the
      polynomial as a product!

Step 3 - Use the "reverse" Distributive Property to factor the expression.

When the leading coefficient is negative, we factor the negative out as part of the GCF.

      If there is no common term in all of the terms of a polynomial, it may be possible to factor by grouping. To do this,
      separate the polynomial into two parts with two terms in each part. Then look for the GCF in each part. If the polynomial

How to Factor a Trinomial of the Form

To figure out how we would factor a trinomial of the form           , such as                   , and factor it to

         , let's start with two general binomials of the form       and                      .

Step 1 - FOIL to find the product.

Step 2 - Factor the GCF from the middle terms.

Our trinomial is of the form        .

This tells us that to factor a trinomial of the form       , we need two factors                and  where the two
numbers and multiply to and add to .

  EXAMPLE 1

Factor:  .

Step 1 - Write the factors as two binomials with the first terms .

Write two sets of parentheses and put as the first term.

Step 2 - Find two numbers, and , that
  · multiply to :
  · add to :

Find two numbers that multiply to 24 and add to 11.

                                                               Factors of 24 Sum of factors

                                                                                 

Step 3 - Use and as the last terms of the factors.
1032  6.5 · Factor Trinomials

      Use 3 and 8 as the last terms of the binomials.

      Step 4 - Check by multiplying the factors.

               

      Let's summarize the steps we used to find the factors.

      How to factor trinomials of the form             :

      Step 1 - Write the factors as two binomials with first terms x.

      Step 2 -Find two numbers, and , that

        · multiply to :
        · add to :

      Step 3 - Use and as the last terms of the factors.

      Step 4 - Check by multiplying the factors.
      In the first example, all terms in the trinomial were positive. What happens when there are negative terms? Well, it
      depends which term is negative. Let's look first at trinomials with only the middle term negative.
      How do you get a positive product and a negative sum? We use two negative numbers.

        EXAMPLE 2

      Factor:                  .

      Again, with the positive last term, , and the negative middle term,  , we need two negative factors. Find two
      numbers that multiply to and add to .

      Step 1 - Write the factors as two binomials with first terms .

      Step 2 - Find two numbers that multiply to 28 and add to -11.
                                                                  Factors of 28 Sum of factors

                                                                                           

      Step 3 - Use -4 and -7 as the last two terms of the binomials.
      Step 4 - Check.

                                                                6.5.2 · Factoring Trinomials with Leading Coefficients of 1   1033

                

Now, what if the last term in the trinomial is negative? Think about FOIL. The last term is the product of the last terms in
the two binomials. A negative product results from multiplying two numbers with opposite signs. You have to be very
careful when you choose factors to make sure you get the correct sign for the middle term, too. How do you get a
negative product and a positive sum? We use one positive and one negative number. When we factor trinomials, we
must have the terms written in descending order--in order from highest degree to lowest degree.

  EXAMPLE 3

Factor:            .

Step 1 - Put the terms in decreasing degree order.

Step 2 - Write the factors as two binomials with first terms .

Step 3 - Find two numbers that multiply to -48 and add to 2.
                                                              Factors of -48 Sum of factors

Since the middle term of the trinomial is positive, the sum of the factors must also be positive. This means that we are
only looking at the factors in which the larger number is positive. This is why factors such as 1 and -48 are not included
in the table.
Step 4 - Use -6 and 8 as the last terms of the binomials.

Step 5 - Check.

           

Sometimes you'll need to factor trinomials of the form          with two variables, such as                      .

The first term, , is the product of the first terms of the binomial factors, . The in the last term means that the

second terms of the binomial factors must each contain . To get the coefficients and , you use the same process

summarized above.

EXAMPLE 4

Factor:               .

We need in the first term of each binomial and in the second term. The last term of the trinomial is negative, so the
1034  6.5 · Factor Trinomials

      factors must have opposite signs.
      Step 1 - Note that the first terms are and the last terms contain .

      Step 2 - Find the numbers that multiply to -9 and add to -8.
                                                                    Factors of -9 Sum of factors

                                                                           

      Step 3 - Use 1 and -9 as coefficients of the last terms.
      Step 4 - Check.

      It is important to keep in mind that some trinomials are prime. The only way to be certain a trinomial is prime is to list all
      the possibilities and show that none of them work. If there are no factor pairs that fit all the requirements, then the
      trinomial is prime.

      Let's summarize the method we just developed to factor trinomials of the form               .

      STRATEGY FOR FACTORING TRINOMIALS OF THE FORM
      When we factor a trinomial, we look at the signs of its terms first to determine the signs of the binomial factors.

      Notice that, in the case when    and have opposite signs, the sign of the one with the larger absolute value matches

Activity                                                  using trial and error:

How to factor trinomials of the form

Step 1 - Write the trinomial in descending order of degrees as needed.

Step 2 - Factor any GCF.

Step 3 - Find all the factor pairs of the first term.

Step 4 - Find all the factor pairs of the third term.

Step 5 - Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found.

Step 6 - Check by multiplying.

Remember these helpful rules when factoring trinomials:

· Factor out the GCF first.
    This is an important rule since it makes the remaining trinomial much simpler to factor. It may change the

        trinomial from the form              to the form  . This would allow you to use the "undoing FOIL"

        process instead of trial and error.

· When the middle term is negative and the last term is positive, the signs in the binomials must both be negative.
    Only two negative numbers will result in a negative sum and a positive product.

· If the leading coefficient is negative, so is the GCF.
    Factoring out the negative sign from the leading coefficient will make the trinomial simpler to factor.

· When the leading term is not 1 and there is no GCF, then the first two terms of the binomial factors will multiply to

    equal the leading term.
    This means you can use trial and error to find the correct binomial factors.

      Our next step is to factor trinomials whose leading coefficient is not , trinomials of the form  . Remember to

      always check for a GCF first! Sometimes, after you factor the GCF, the leading coefficient of the trinomial becomes and

      you can factor it by the methods we've used so far. Let's do an example to see how this works.

      EXAMPLE 1

      Factor completely:                  .

      Step 1 - The trinomial is already written in descending order of degrees.

      Step 2 - Is there a greatest common factor?

      Yes,       . Factor it.

      Is it a binomial, trinomial, or more than three terms?

      It is now a trinomial with a leading coefficient of . So "undo FOIL."

      Step 3 - Use a table like the one shown to find two numbers that multiply to and add to .

                                                   Factors of   Sum of factors

      Step 4 - Use -1 and 5 as coefficients of the last terms.
      Step 5 - Check.

      What happens when the leading coefficient is not and there is no GCF? There are several methods that can be used to
      factor these trinomials. First we will use the trial and error method.

        EXAMPLE 2

      Factor the trinomial             .

      The trinomial is already written in descending order of degrees. There is no GCF to factor.

      From our earlier work, we expect this will factor into two binomials.

      We know the first terms of the binomial factors will multiply to give us   . The only factors of are , . We can
      place them in the binomials.

Check: Does  ?

We know the last terms of the binomials will multiply to . Since this trinomial has all positive terms, we only need to
consider positive factors. The only factors of are , . But we now have two cases to consider because it will make a
difference if we write , or , .

Which factors are correct? To decide that, we multiply the inner and outer terms.

Since the middle term of the trinomial is , the factors in the first case will work. Let's use FOIL to check.

                     

Our result of the factoring is:

How to factor trinomials of the form  using trial and error.

Step 1 - Write the trinomial in descending order of degrees as needed.
Step 2 - Factor any GCF.
Step 3 - Find all the factor pairs of the first term.
Step 4 - Find all the factor pairs of the third term.
Step 5 - Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found.
Step 6 - Check by multiplying.
1038  6.5 · Factor Trinomials

      Remember, when the middle term is negative and the last term is positive, the signs in the binomials must both be
      negative.

      When we factor an expression, we always look for a greatest common factor first. If the expression does not have a
      greatest common factor, there cannot be one in its factors either. This may help us eliminate some of the possible factor
      combinations.

        EXAMPLE 3

      Factor completely using trial and error:                .

      Step 1 - The trinomial is already in descending order.

      Step 2 - Find the factors of the first term.

      Step 3 - Find the factors of the last term. Consider the signs. Since 15 is positive and the coefficient of the middle term is
      negative, we use the negative factors.

      Step 4 - Consider all the combinations of factors.

      Step 5 - The correct factors are those whose product is the original trinomial.
      Step 6 - Check by multiplying.

      In other trinomials, don't forget to look for a GCF first, and remember if the leading coefficient is negative, so is the GCF.

      Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials

      Some trinomials are perfect squares. They result from multiplying a binomial by itself. We squared a binomial using the
      Binomial Squares pattern in a previous lesson.

      The trinomial                    is called a perfect square trinomial. It is the square of the binomial  .

      In this chapter, you will start with a perfect square trinomial and factor it into its prime factors.

      You could factor this trinomial using the methods described in the last section since it is of the form     . But if

      you recognize that the first and last terms are squares and the trinomial fits the perfect square trinomials pattern, you

      will save yourself a lot of work.

      Here is the pattern--the reverse of the binomial squares pattern.

To use this pattern, you have to recognize that a given trinomial fits it. Check first to see if the leading coefficient is a
perfect square, . Next, check that the last term is a perfect square, . Then check the middle term: Is it the product,

     ? If everything checks, you can easily write the factors.

· Check the middle term. Is it ?            ? Does it match?
    Is twice the product of and

 Yes, so we have a perfect square trinomial!

Step 2 - Write the square of the binomial.

Step 3 - Check by multiplying.

         

The sign of the middle term determines which pattern we will use. When the middle term is negative, we use the pattern

         , which factors to     .

The steps are summarized here.

Remember, the first step in factoring is to look for a greatest common factor. Perfect square trinomials may have a GCF
in all three terms, and it should be factored out first. And, sometimes, once the GCF has been factored, you will recognize
a perfect square trinomial.

Remember, "difference" refers to subtraction. So, to use this pattern, you must make sure you have a binomial in which
two squares are being subtracted.

  How to factor the difference of squares:

  Step 1 - Does the binomial fit the pattern?
  Is this a difference?
  Are the first and last terms perfect squares?

Step 2 - Write them as squares.
Step 3 - Write the product of conjugates.
Step 4 - Check by multiplying.

EXAMPLE 1

Factor:    .

Step 1 - Does the binomial fit the pattern?

· Is this a difference?
    Yes.

· Are the first and last terms perfect squares?
    Yes.

Step 2 - Write them as the difference of squares.

Step 3 - Write the product of conjugates.

Step 4 - Check by multiplying.

         

It is important to remember that sums of squares do not factor into a product of binomials. There are no binomial

factors that multiply together to get a sum of squares. After removing any GCF, the expression  is prime!

The next example shows variables in both terms.
1054  6.6 · Factor Special Products

      EXAMPLE 2

      Factor:            .

      Step 1 - Is this a difference of squares?

      Yes.

      Step 2 - Factor as the product of conjugates.

      Step 3 - Check by multiplying.

                     

      As always, you should look for a common factor first whenever you have an expression to factor. Sometimes a common
      factor may "disguise" the difference of squares, and you won't recognize the perfect squares until you factor out the GCF.
      Also, to completely factor the binomial in the next example, we'll factor a difference of squares twice!

        EXAMPLE 3

      Factor:                        .

      Step 1 - Is there a GCF?

      Yes, --factor it out!

      Step 2 - Is the binomial a difference of squares? Yes.

      Step 3 - Factor as a product of conjugates.

      Step 4 - Notice the first binomial is also a difference of squares!

      Step 5 - Factor it as the product of conjugates.

      The last factor, the sum of squares, cannot be factored.
      Step 6 - Check by multiplying.

These are the steps to use when deciding how to factor a polynomial. We will review an example after looking at these
steps.

Use a general strategy for factoring polynomials:

Step 1 - Is there a greatest common factor? Factor it out.

Step 2 - Is the polynomial a binomial, a trinomial, or are there more than three terms?

If it is a binomial:

· Is it a sum?
    Of squares? Sums of squares do not factor.
    Of cubes? Use the sum of cubes pattern.

· Is it a difference?
    Of squares? Factor as the product of conjugates.

If it is a trinomial:

· Is it of the form              ? Undo FOIL.

· Is it of the form               ?

 If and are squares, check if it fits the trinomial square pattern.

 Use trial and error or the " " method.

If it has more than three terms:

· Use the grouping method.

Step 3 - Check.

· Is it factored completely?
· Do the factors multiply back to the original polynomial?

PROJECT 6: POLYNOMIALS AND RECTANGLES

Project 6 Overview

In this culminating project, you will use polynomials to model dimensions and areas of rectangles. Both activities in the
lesson use the dimensions and areas of rectangles to apply the skills of working with polynomials learned throughout
the unit.
In the first activity, you will be given diagrams of rectangles with side lengths labeled and asked to complete a table to
find the missing measures of length, width, or area.
In the second activity, you will be given a table of measures of rectangles, similar to the table in the previous activity.
However, you will not have the visual of the rectangles. Again, you will be given the area of rectangles and asked to find
the dimensions.
In the third activity, you will create your own table with given measures. When you are done, you will trade tables with a
partner and work to find the missing measures in their created problem. After the activity, be prepared to discuss the
methods you used to create the table.
Throughout the project, you will have an opportunity to apply the skills of working with polynomials as you add, multiply,
divide, and factor polynomials to find the missing measures of rectangles.

      Unit 6 Wrap Up

      Throughout this unit, you learned that Ozzy Gamez and Juan Quezada can use polynomials to make decisions that will
      help their business, Plant Shop Chicago, run smoothly. Understanding polynomials can help them plan revenue and
      costs so they can make a profit.
      In this unit, you learned how to classify polynomials and determine their degree. You added and subtracted polynomials
      by combining like terms. You multiplied polynomials using the Distributive Property, vertical alignment, and the FOIL
      method. You learned to recognize special case products, such as binomial squares and conjugate pairs, to facilitate their
      multiplication. You divided by monomials using the Quotient of Powers Property, and you divided polynomials by
      polynomials using long division and synthetic division.
      You factored the GCF, greatest common factor, from a polynomial by using the "reverse" of the Distributive Property. You
      learned to factor a polynomial by grouping. You learned methods for factoring trinomials, such as undoing FOIL and trial
      and error. You learned to recognize patterns of perfect square trinomials and difference of squares. Finally, you learned
      to analyze a polynomial by its form and to select an appropriate strategy for factoring.

               Access our Unit 6 Student Self-Assessment (https://openstax.org/r/unit-6-self-assesment) to reflect on the skills
               you learned during this unit. Congratulations on completing Unit 6!

      Building Character: Judgment

      Throughout this unit, you learned that judgment is important for making sound decisions without bias. You can improve
      judgment through experience and by trying to understand the qualities that contribute to good judgment.

UNIT 7 OVERVIEW AND READINESS

Unit 7 Overview

Why Should I Care?

Have you ever heard of, or participated in, a "Punkin Chunkin" contest? Watch the following video to learn more, and how
quadratics may play a role.

Access multimedia content (http://openstax.org/books/algebra-1/pages/7-unit-7-overview)
In this unit, you will learn about quadratic functions systematically and use quadratics to model real-world scenarios like
ballistic motion. You will look at patterns that grow quadratically and contrast them with linear and exponential growth.
Then you will examine other quadratic relationships via tables, graphs, and equations, gaining appreciation for some of
the special features of quadratic functions and the situations they represent.

You will also analyze equivalent quadratic expressions to understand how these expressions help to reveal important
behavior of the associated quadratic function and its graph. You will gain an appreciation for the factored, standard, and
vertex forms of a quadratic function and use these forms to solve problems.

Building Character: Proactivity

Punkin Chunkin competitions encourage teams to design and build machines to throw pumpkins the greatest distance.
To win, teams must work together and use creative thinking. In teams like these, one person often steps up and leads
the group to accomplish the tasks they need to finish. They don't wait to take direction from others; they set the tone
themselves. This is an example of proactivity. Working together as a group to brainstorm ideas and come up with
solutions to problems before they happen is another way to be proactive in a team setting.

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your proactivity. Proactivity is the ability to take initiative. Proactive
people don't accept the world as it is or wait for direction from others to initiate change. Instead, they take matters into
their own hands, acting to make the world better for themselves and others. They speak truth to power, take charge to
solve problems, and champion new ideas. There's evidence that proactivity is one of the qualities that distinguished the
greatest American presidents from their peers. And there's also evidence that it's a trait you can develop.

Think about your current sense of proactivity. How many of the following statements are true for you?

  · I am always looking for better ways of doing things.
  · I love to challenge the status quo.
  · I enjoy being a champion for ideas, even against opposition.
  · I like to be the one to take initiative.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Am I Ready to Learn This?

Getting Ready for Unit 7

To be ready for this unit, you need to be able to:

  · Multiply binomials.
  · Factor trinomials.
  · Compare linear and exponential functions.

Next, you will answer some questions that will help you see how ready you are for this unit. If you need help, some mini-
lessons will help you brush up on anything you need to work on.

      Multiplying Binomials

      You can multiply polynomials using the distributive property.

        EXAMPLE 1

      Multiply   using the distributive property.

      Step 1 - Multiply each term in the first binomial by the second binomial.

      Step 2 - Use the distributive property to eliminate the parentheses.

      Step 3 - Combine like terms.

      There is a pattern when multiplying two polynomials that are binomials.

        · The first term in the result is the product of the first terms in each binomial.
        · The second and third terms are the product of multiplying the two outer terms and then the two inner terms.
        · The last term results from multiplying the two last terms.

      The method "First, Outer, Inner, Last" is abreviated as FOIL. It represents multiplying the First terms, Last terms, Inner
      terms, and Last terms of the binomials. The word "FOIL" is easy to remember and ensures you find all four products.

        EXAMPLE 2

      Multiply   using FOIL.

      Step 1 - Multiply the First terms, Outer terms, Inner terms, and Last terms.

      Step 2 - Combine like terms.

1078  Unit 7 Overview and Readiness

      To factor the trinomial, we need factors of 12, and , so that the sum,       , is 8.

      Use a table to find all the different combinations of factors of 12. Then, find the sum of the factors.

      The numbers 2 and 6 have a product of 12 and a sum of 8. They are the factors we need:

      EXAMPLE 2

      Factor the trinomial             .

      To factor the trinomial, we need factors of -24, and , so that the sum,      is -5.

      · The product of the factors is negative, so the factors must have opposite signs.
      · The sum is negative, so the negative sign will go with the factor with the greater absolute value.

                                          Factors of 12 Sum of factors

In each situation, the -values are increasing by one. These can also be called consecutive terms.

· If the difference in the -values of consecutive terms is always the same constant, then the values in the table can
    be modeled by a linear function. The constant is the slope, or rate of change.

· If the quotient for the -values of consecutive terms is always the same constant, then the values in the table can be
    modeled by an exponential function. The constant is the growth factor.

· It is possible for a table to be a set of values that is neither of these relationships.

Using this information you can see that in the first table, the difference in consecutive -values is the same constant:

8-       ,    ,  ,                     . The differences are the same, so the table represents a linear function.

In the second table, the quotient of consecutive terms is the same:                  ,             . The quotient is the

same, so the table represents an exponential function.

Linear growth happens at a constant rate. The rate of change, or slope, in the first table is 4. The linear function is of the

form          , where m is the slope.

Exponential growth does not happen at a constant rate. The growth factor is constant, but the rate of growth changes as

the value of the independent variable, , changes. The exponential function is of the form          , where is the growth

factor.

      squared term. It can be written in other ways as well, but the expression should be able to be written with the highest

      exponent on the variable as 2.

      · A quadratic relationship is not like a linear relationship because as one quantity increases by a certain amount, the
          second quantity doesn't increase by the same amount.

      · A quadratic relationship is not like an exponential relationship because as one quantity increases by a certain
          amount, the second quantity doesn't change by the same factor. (In this case, if the number of squares grew
          exponentially, this would mean that, from each step to the next, the number of squares is multiplied by the same
          factor.)

time, given the effect of constantly changing speed. You will construct quadratic functions to represent projectile
motions, objects that are launched directly upward. Working through the activities, you will discover that gravity affects

The peak of the parabola, where the maximum occurs, is also called the vertex of the graph.

c. Estimate when the ball hits the ground.

The zero of a function is where the function equals 0, or where it crosses the -axis. In this case, there is only one zero
where the cannonball hits the ground. The parabola does cross the -axis in the negative -values, but that does not
make sense in this problem.

Look at where the object has a height of 0 feet, or the zero of the function. This happens at approximately 3.75 seconds.

Notice there would be another zero on the graph of the function to the left of  , but that does not make sense in the

problem because the object was thrown from 5 feet.

      7.6.6 Lesson Summary

      In this lesson, you learned how to:

        · Create quadratic functions and graphs that represent a situation.
        · Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a situation.
        · Know that the domain of a function can depend on the situation it represents.

      Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:

        · 7.6.1: Using Linear Functions to Describe Constant Speed
             In this activity, you considered what happens if an object is launched up in the air unaffected by gravity. It
                 reinforced your knowledge that an object that travels at a constant speed can be described with a linear function.

        · 7.6.2: The Force of Gravity Change in Quadratic Functions
             In this activity, you learned a model that accounts for the fact that an object that is launched straight up at a
                 constant speed does not keep going at the same rate when the influence of gravity is taken into account. The big
                 lesson was that adding a quadratic term to a linear function has an effect of "bending" the graph, as the output
                 values are no longer changing at a constant rate.

      Revenue Represented with Quadratics

      Quadratic functions often come up when studying revenue. (Revenue means the money collected when someone sells
      something.)

      Suppose we are selling raffle tickets and deciding how much to charge for each ticket. When the price of the tickets is
      higher, typically fewer tickets will be sold.

      Each ticket has a price of dollars, and it is possible to sell     tickets. We can find the revenue by multiplying the

      price by the number of tickets expected to be sold. A function that models the revenue, , collected is

                        . Here is a graph that represents the function.

It makes sense that the revenue goes down after a certain point, since if the price is too high nobody will buy a ticket.

From the graph, we can tell that the greatest revenue,  , comes from selling the tickets for each. So we know,

the range of this parabola reaches a maximum value of $1,200.

We can also see that the domain of the function is between and . This makes sense because the cost of the tickets
can't be negative, and if the price were more than , the model would not work, as the revenue collected cannot be
negative. (A negative revenue would mean the number of tickets sold is negative, which is not possible.)

      · The domain is the values,                or only numbers from up through . Negative values of time don't make

      sense here, so the part of the graph to the left side of the vertical axis has no meaning. The object hits the ground

      · The range of the height of the function is from the initial height down to the ground. In this case, since the object is
          being dropped from a height of 576 feet and falls to the ground, the range of the function is [0, 576]. This means
          that the object's height will be between 0 feet (when it hits the ground) and 576 feet (when it is initially dropped).

Graphing Quadratics With Points

The function given by                  is written in factored form. Recall that this form is helpful for finding the

zeros of the function (where the function has the value 0) and telling us the -intercepts on the graph representing the

function.

Here is a graph representing . It shows two -intercepts at       and    .

If we use -1 and 3 as inputs to , what are the outputs?

·
·

Because the inputs -1 and 3 produce an output of 0, they are the zeros of the function . And because both values
have 0 for their value, they also give us the -intercepts of the graph (the points where the graph crosses the -axis,
which always have a -coordinate of 0). So, the zeros of a function have the same values as the -coordinates of the

 -intercepts of the graph of the function.

The factored form can also help us identify the vertex of the graph, which is the point where the function reaches its

minimum value. Notice that the -coordinate of the vertex is 1, and that 1 is halfway between -1 and 3. Once we know

the -coordinate of the vertex, we can find the -coordinate by evaluating the function

                                       . So the vertex is at  .

When a quadratic function is in standard form, the -intercept is clear: its -coordinate is the constant term in

           . To find the -intercept from factored form, we can evaluate the function at  , because the -intercept

is the point where the graph has an input value of 0:

      Axis of Symmetry of a Quadratic

      In the graph of a quadratic function, the axis of symmetry is an imaginary line that cuts the parabola in half to create two
      symmetrical sides. It goes through the vertex of the parabola so the equation of the axis of symmetry is the same as the

       -coordinate of the vertex.

      Notice that in Figure 1, the vertex is at     and the axis of symmetry is at  .

Comparing Transformations to Quadratic Graphs

Remember that the graph representing any quadratic function is a shape called a parabola. People often say that a

parabola "opens upward" when the lowest point on the graph is the vertex (where the graph changes direction), and

"opens downward" when the highest point on the graph is the vertex. Each coefficient in a quadratic expression written

in standard form  tells us something important about the graph that represents it.

The graph of      is a parabola opening upward with vertex at              . Adding a constant term 5 gives
                                                                            and moves the graph 4 units down.
and raises the graph by 5 units. Subtracting 4 from gives

                                              -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3
                                              9 4 1 0 14 9
                                              14 9 6 5 6 9 14
                                              5 0 -3 -4 -3 0 5

A table of values can help us see that adding 5 to increases all the output values of  by 5, which explains
why the graph moves up 5 units. Subtracting 4 from decreases all the output values of       by 4, which explains
why the graph shifts down by 4 units.

In general, the constant term of a quadratic expression in standard form influences the vertical position of the graph. An

expression with no constant term (such as or  ) means that the constant term is 0, so the -intercept of the

graph is on the -axis. It's not shifted up or down relative to the -axis.

Coefficient of the Squared Term

The coefficient of the squared term in a quadratic function also tells us something about its graph. The coefficient of the

squared term in   is 1. Its graph is a parabola that opens upward.

Multiplying   by a number greater than 1 makes the graph steeper, so the parabola is narrower than that representing
   .

Multiplying by a number less than 1 but greater than 0 makes the graph less steep, so the parabola is wider than that
representing .

Multiplying by a number less than 0 makes the parabola open downward.

      If we compare the output values of and          , we see that they are opposites, which suggests that one graph would
      be a reflection of the other across the -axis.

      In the previous examples, parameters were being applied to the output values of the function. In other words, after an
      input value was squared, something was then added, subtracted, or multiplied with the squared value. The resulting
      impact on the graph was to vertically alter it.

      However, what happens when the input value is altered before applying the exponent? In these situations, the impact on
      the graph is to produce a horizontal transformation.

      Horizontal Shifts

      Return to the quadratic parent function,        . The function is equivalent to  . While a bit obvious,

      this implies there is no change to the input value before being squared.

      If the number used to change the input is greater than 0, then the graph of the function is shifted to the right.

      Conversely, if the number used to change the input is less than 0, the graph of the function is shifted to the left. Note the
      impact to the subtraction operation when negative values are subtracted from the input.

(  0 1 4 9 16 25 36

Notice in this table of values that the change to the input values takes place before squaring the term. The constant is
directly affecting the -value before applying the function rule.

Examine the vertex of each graph. When we compare the graphs of              and  to the graph of the parent

function, we see the parabola has been shifted to the right 3 units and left 3 units, respectively. Thus, a horizontal shift in

the graph results when a constant has been subtracted from the input value.

Horizontal Dilations and Reflections

Now we will investigate the impact of a coefficient on the input value.

Multiplying the input value by a value greater than 1 and then applying the exponent, results in a parabola that has been
horizontally compressed.

Multiplying the input value by a value that is between 0 and 1, yields a parabola that has been horizontally stretched.

      If the input value is multiplied by a negative number, then the parabola is reflected over the -axis. However, due to the
      symmetric nature of parabolas, this is difficult to discern visually.

      Multiplying the input value by a number changes the quantity that is squared. As a result, the graph of the equation is
      horizontally stretched or compressed.

7.13.0 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will work on activities that focus on the coefficient of the linear term, the in      , and how

changes to it affect the graph. You will discover that adding a linear term to the squared term translates the graph in

both horizontal and vertical directions. This understanding will show that writing an expression such as  in

factored form can help us reason how to sketch the graph.

The Meaning of Values on a Graph

Let's say a tennis ball is hit straight up in the air, and its height in feet above the ground is modeled by the equation
                               where represents the time in seconds after the ball is hit. Here is a graph that represents the

function, from the time the tennis ball was hit until the time it reached the ground.

In the graph, we can see some information we already know, and some new information:

· The 4 in the equation means the graph of the function intersects the vertical axis at 4. It shows that the tennis ball

was 4 feet off the ground at   , when it was hit.

· The horizontal intercept is  . It tells us that the tennis ball hit the ground 1 second after it was hit.

· The vertex of the graph is at approximately       . This means that about 0.4 second after the ball was hit, it

reached the maximum height of about 6.3 feet.

The equation can be written in factored form as                          . From this form, we can see that the zeros of

the function are   and         . The negative zero, -14, is not meaningful in this situation because the time before the

ball was hit is irrelevant.

      The expression that defines is written in vertex form. We can show that it is equivalent to the expression defining by

      If this simplified expression is factored, then we arrive at the expression that defines function :                    . The

Why Should I Care?

When you launch an object, it does not travel in a straight line. Instead, it follows a curved path called a parabola. This
means you have to account for distance, height, and angle if you want to hit your target. You can use quadratic
equations to find these measurements.

The next time you throw a ball, think about the parabolic path that it follows.

      Using Vertex Form

      The vertex form of a quadratic is below:

      Notice that the value of  is the opposite of what it is in the parenthesis. This seems odd: when we add , the vertex of
      the parabola moves up     units. But when we subtract within the squared term, the vertex of the parabola moves right

        units, not left.

      Let's explore why. We know the -coordinate of the vertex is    . To find that using this equation, we need to know

      where               is zero, because that will make     . Set  . This happens when  , which is when

      . That means is the -coordinate of the vertex.

      EXAMPLE

      Find the vertex of                      .

      The parabola of the quadratic will shift right 4 (remember this horizontal shift is counterintuitive and translates in the
      opposite direction of what the expression "looks like") and down 2.

Using Key Points to Graph Quadratics

We saw that vertex form is especially helpful for finding the vertex of a graph of a quadratic function. For example, we

can tell that the function given by                has a vertex at  .

We also noticed that, when the squared expression            has a positive coefficient, the graph opens upward. You can

use the vertex     to determine that minimum function value is 1.

But why does the function take on its minimum value when is 3?

Here is one way to explain it: When      , the squared term        equals 0, as  . When is any other

value besides 3, the squared term           is a positive number greater than 0. (Squaring any number results in a

positive number.) This means that the output when  will always be greater than the output when              , so the

function has a minimum value at          .

This table shows some values of the function for some values of . Notice that the output is the least when  and it
increases both as increases and as it decreases.
1250  7.16 · Graphing from the Vertex Form

      The squared term sometimes has a negative coefficient, for instance:       . The value that makes

         equal 0 is -4, because                         . Any other value makes  greater than 0. But when

      is multiplied by a negative number (-2), the resulting expression,    , ends up being negative. This means that

      the output when  will always be less than the output when             , so the function has its maximum value when

      .

      Remember that we can find the -intercept of the graph representing any function we have seen. The -coordinate of

      the -intercept is the value of the function when  . If is defined by                        , then the -intercept is

      because                               . Its vertex is at            . Another point on the graph with the same

      -coordinate is located the same horizontal distance from the vertex but on the other side.

The graph that represents            has its vertex at

Notice that adding 12 to raises the graph by 12 units, so the vertex of that graph is at  . Replacing with

      shifts the graph 3 units to the left, so the vertex is now at     .

We can also shift a graph both horizontally and vertically.

The graph that represents                      will look like that for     but it will be shifted 12 units up and 3

units to the left. Its vertex is at  .

Translating Functions

A vertical shift transforms the parent function into another function by moving the graph up or down "d" units.
A horizontal shift transforms the parent function into another function by moving the graph left or right "c" units.

The graph representing the equation                          has the same vertex at       , but because the squared

term           is multiplied by a negative number, the graph is flipped over horizontally, so that it opens downward.

      Quadratic equations can also be transformed through dilations that stretch or compress the parabola. The graphs for

      the parent quadratic function,        , and      , and                     are all parabolas. The second and third

      equation, however, have been vertically dilated from the parent function.

      The orange dashed parabola represents            and depicts the result of multiplying each output of the function by
      4. This dilation represents a vertical stretch.

      The green dotted parabola represents             and depicts a graph where each of the output values from the

      function are multiplied by . This dilation represents a vertical compression.

      The scale factor of the coefficient we multiply by determines the impact on the graph. If the scale factor is greater than 1,
      then the dilation is a vertical stretch. If the scale factor is between 0 and 1, then the dilation is a vertical compression.

      When quadratic equations are dilated horizontally, the result looks similar but the impact to the function is very different

      because horizontal dilations affect the input values before the function is applied. The graphs for the parent quadratic

Project 7 Overview

In this culminating project, you will integrate ideas from the unit by designing a fountain with given criteria. You will use
the fact that the shape made by water coming out of a jet or fountain can be modeled with a quadratic equation.
In the first activity, you will work through a simplified example with one fountain and one jet. Then, you will think about
what information is needed to write the equation and create a sketch to draw the path. Next, you will determine
reasonable measurements to write the equation. Understanding the use of the vertex form of a quadratic equation will
be helpful.
The second activity gives you an opportunity to design a fountain with three to five jets. You will be given certain
measurements and criteria to meet to write the equation for paths of the jets. When you are done, you will present your
equations and an explanation of what information you used and how you wrote the equation of the path of the jets.

  · Use quadratic functions to solve a real-world problem.

Introduction to Fountain Design

The trapezoid represents the statue and the red dot is the location of the water jet.

 1. What would you need to know in order to write an equation for a path for the water that would make it go over the
      statue?

 2. What is a reasonable height of the statue and a reasonable distance from the jet to the statue?
 3. What strategy would you use to find the equation for the path of the water?

Design a Fountain

A nearby park has a decorative pool, and the board of commissioners of the park is considering installing water jets in
the pool to make it into a fountain. They have asked you to design the water jets. Here is a diagram of the pool from
above:
1274  Project 7: Design a Fountain

        · A and B are statues which are 4 feet tall.
        · C and D are wider statues which are 5.5 feet tall.
        · E is a statue with a vase on top, which is 8 feet tall.
        · The pool is 15 feet wide.
      The diagram is drawn to scale. The dots along the edge show where jets can be placed. You don't have to put jets in all
      five places. The jets will be at water level.
      You will need to figure out how many jets there should be, where they should go, and what path the water should make.
      Your design needs to meet these criteria:
        · The jets can only go in the places indicated by the dots.
        · There must be at least two jets.
        · The water can't hit any of the statues.
        · Some water must go into the vase.
        · The water can't go higher than 10 feet.
      When you have your final design, you should create a presentation to explain it to the commissioners. The presentation
      should show the paths of the water and include your mathematical descriptions of the paths.
      How did your work creating one fountain in part 1 help with your process in part 2 where you created multiple
      fountains?

      Unit 7 Wrap Up

      Throughout this unit, you learned about machines that students of Howard Bernard created for a Punkin Chunkin
      competition. While working within a budget as a constraint, students created a machine that would launch a pumpkin
      the farthest. While creating the machines, students relied on quadratic functions to represent the paths of the pumpkins
      and tweak their designs.
      In the beginning of this unit, you explored different patterns that weren't linear and exponential and discovered how to
      recognize quadratic functions from geometric patterns. You then used quadratic functions to describe a variety of
      quadratic situations.
      You also learned to write equivalent quadratic expressions in standard, factored, and vertex forms.
      Finally, you learned how to graph quadratics using the different forms and that each form helps to find key
      characteristics about quadratic graphs.

               Access our Unit 7 Student Self-Assessment (https://openstax.org/r/unit-7-self-assesment) to reflect on the skills
               you learned during this unit. Congratulations on completing Unit 7!

      Building Character: Proactivity

      Throughout this unit, you learned that proactivity is important for taking initiative and brainstorming ideas. You
      discovered that proactivity is a trait that can be learned and comes from a willingness to initiate change. Proactive
      people are always looking to improve ways of doing things and are often leaders in different settings. They encourage
      brainstorming of ideas within teams to create solutions to problems.

Unit 8 Overview

Why Should I Care?

Imagine you are at a park. This park has a large water fountain. In this fountain, streams of water shoot up and arc from
the middle to the edge of the fountain's pool. The streams of water always land inside the pool. How does this work?

Also at this park, you see a group of children playing catch with a ball. What do the fountain and the kids playing with the
ball have in common?

The answer? Quadratic equations!

Watch the video to learn a bit about how we can see quadratic equations in everyday things, from water fountains to
playing with a ball.

Access multimedia content (http://openstax.org/books/algebra-1/pages/8-unit-8-overview)
In this unit, you will learn about quadratic equations. Understanding quadratic equations can help you understand the
world around you. For example, they can be used to determine the maximum height a thrown ball will reach and the
time it takes for the ball to hit the ground.

Building Character: Curiosity

In the video, you learned that Juan David Crespo used quadratic equations to plan how high and far each stream of
water will go in a fountain. But how exactly does he do it? Are you interested in learning more?

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your curiosity. Curiosity is the desire to learn and understand new
things. When you are curious about something, you process it on a deeper level than just basic understanding. People
typically spend more time learning about things they are curious about and more readily remember the information.
Curious people tend to be happier individuals.

Think about your current sense of curiosity. How many of the following statements are true for you?

  · I got so absorbed in learning that I lost track of time.
  · I took the initiative to learn more about one of my interests.
  · When I didn't know the answer to a question, I couldn't rest until I figured it out.
  · I explored a completely new idea or topic--just for the fun of it.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Am I Ready to Learn This?

Getting Ready for Unit 8

To be ready for this unit, you need to be able to:

  · Write equivalent expressions using the distributive property.
  · Find the -intercepts of the graph of a quadratic equation given in factored form.

8.1.0 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will encounter a problem that cannot be easily solved by familiar strategies. After exploring different
ways to solve the problem, you will write a quadratic equation to model the situation. You will also interpret what the
solution to that equation means in the given context.

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

  · Explain the meaning of a solution to an equation in terms of a situation.
  · Write a quadratic equation that represents a situation.

8.1.1 Understanding a Situation with Quadratic Equations

Warm Up

A mechanical device is used to launch a potato vertically into the air. The potato is launched from a platform 20 feet
above the ground, with an initial vertical velocity of 92 feet per second.

The function  models the height of the potato over the ground, in feet, seconds after launch.

Here is the graph representing the function.

For each question, explain your reasoning.          2. Will the potato still be in the air 8 seconds after
                                                        launch?

      8.1.2 Modeling a Quadratic Problem

      Activity

      Your teacher will give you a picture that is 7 inches by 4 inches, a piece of colored paper that measures 4 inches by 2.5
      inches representing framing material, a ruler, and a pair of scissors.

      Cut the framing material to create a rectangular frame for the picture. The frame should have the same width all the way
      around and have no overlaps. All of the framing material should be used with no leftover pieces. The frame should not
      cover any part of the picture.

      Let's review the information we know.

      · The picture measures 7 inches by 4 inches.

      · There are 10 square inches of framing material.

      · The frame must be uniform in width.

      · All of the framing material must be used.

      · The frame should not cover any part of the picture.

      Describe the process you used to create the frame.

      Now that you have completed the activity, can you think of any mathematical method to solve the problem?

      Are you ready for more?

      Extending Your Thinking

      Juan says, "The perimeter of the picture is 22 inches. If I cut the framing material into 9 pieces, each one being 2.5 inches

      by inch, I'll have more than enough material to surround the picture because those pieces would yield      , or 22.5

      inches for the frame."

      Do you agree with Juan? Be prepared to show your reasoning.

      Self Check

      Suppose you want to frame a picture that measures 8 inches by 3 inches. The frame is created from 12 square inches
      of framing material. The frame must be uniform in width, and all of the framing material must be used. Which
      statement is true?
       a. The total area of the framed picture will be 36 square inches.
      b. The perimeter of the framed picture will be 22 inches.
       c. The total area of the framed picture will be 24 square inches.
      d. The frame will measure exactly 8 inches by 3 inches.

Let represent the thickness of the frame in inches.

Since the picture is 8 inches by 6 inches, it has an area of 48 square inches.

Using Various Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations

A tennis ball is thrown out of the window of a building. The equation modeling the height of the tennis ball, in feet,
seconds after being thrown is shown here.

Let's find the equation we would solve to find the time at which the ball hits the ground.
When the ball hits the ground, its height will be 0. So, we set the equation to 0.

The equation above represents the ball when it hits the ground. The solution to this equation represents the time it takes
from when the ball is thrown for it to hit the ground.

Let's try to solve the equation.

Step 1 - Write the equation to be solved.

Step 2 - Subtract 30 from each side of the equation.

Step 3 - Divide each side of the equation by 3.

Let's try to solve the remaining equation using guess and check.

When       , the expression                has a value of         , or . This value is not equal to the we

needed to find.

When       , the expression                has a value of         , or . This value is equal to the we needed
to find.

The equation is true when    , so the ball took 2 seconds to hit the ground. This method works but can be more

difficult when the solution is a decimal. Graphing can also work, but it is time consuming and results in an approximate

solution.

We know the total trip takes the weather balloon 4 hours. Since the graph representing the flight of the weather balloon
is symmetric, if it takes 1 hour to reach 30 miles up, then 1 hour from touching the ground, it will be at 30 miles up again.
So, the weather balloon will be 30 miles above Earth after 3 hours.

      Let's look again at the zero product property.

      If         , then    or          , or     .

      We can use the zero product property to help reason through finding the solutions to complex quadratic equations.
      We know that if factors are multiplied together and the result is 0, then one of those factors must equal 0.

        EXAMPLE 1

      This equation has two different factors that, when multiplied, result in a product of 0.
      To find possible solutions to this equation, we can set each factor equal to 0 and solve.

      The value          makes the first factor equal to 0. The value          makes the second factor equal to 0.

      Applying the Zero Product Property to Solve a Real-World Projectile Problem

      We have previously looked at functions representing the motion of projectiles. We analyzed two equivalent expressions
      that define the same quadratic function, one in quadratic form and the other in factored form.

      Now we're going to look at a similar problem, but with the additional knowledge of how the function relates to the zero
      product property.

      Let's look at an example.

      The equivalent functions below model the height, in feet, of a baseball seconds after being hit.

      Using the zero product property, the quadratic expression in factored form allows you to more easily find out when the
      height of the baseball is 0 feet.

      Without graphing, we can determine at what time the baseball reaches the ground.

      Let's apply the zero product property to solve                         .

      Set each factor equal to 0 and solve.

      So,          and  . These values of represent the roots of the function. Because the object was launched at         ,

      the negative solution doesn't make sense in this context of time. So the baseball reaches the ground in 3 seconds.

      There is one benefit of knowing the function in quadratic form. By substituting 0 in for , we can easily determine at what

      height the baseball was hit, when      seconds.

      So, the baseball was hit at a height of 3 feet. Note that this point,     , is the -intercept of the function when graphed.

= 0 are useful strategies for solving equations. You will also review the ties between the zeros of a function and the
horizontal intercepts of its graph, which you began exploring in an earlier unit.

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

  · Explain why dividing by a variable to solve a quadratic equation is not a good strategy.
  · Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none.

Interpreting Graphs to Solve Quadratic Equations

Let's analyze and interpret the graphs of different quadratic equations.

  EXAMPLE 1

First, let's look at the equation                 .

We will graph the equation             .

This graph has two -intercepts.

The solutions to                   are -values that make the expression have a value of 0.

At the -intercepts, the -value of the expression            is 0, so the -intercepts give the solutions.

The -intercepts and solutions to the equation are 4 and 7.
1322  8.5 · How Many Solutions?

      Note that the values of 4 and 7 could be referred to as solutions of the equation, -intercepts of the graph, roots of the
      equation, or zeros of the equation.

        EXAMPLE 2

      Let's look at a different example.

      First, we rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0.

      We will graph the equation                               .

      This graph has one -intercept. It is an example of a double root at 5.5. A double root is a root that appears twice in the
      solution of an algebraic equation.

      The solution is the -coordinate of the -intercept.

      So, the solution to              is 5.5.

      EXAMPLE 3

      Let's look at one last example.

      First, we rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0.

      We will graph the equation                            .

The graph has no -intercepts.

So, there are no real solutions for  .

Remember, when a quadratic expression is equal to 0 and we want to find the unknown values, we can think of it as
finding the zeros of a quadratic function, or finding the -intercepts of the graph of that function.

Step 3 - Use the diagram to write the expression in standard form.

The expressions are equivalent.

When the coefficients of the -terms are both 1 in the factored form:

Take notice that the linear term ( -term) in the expression in standard form is the sum of the two numbers in the
expression in factored form.

· In the example above, the term  is the sum of the two numbers -9 and -6.

Also, the constant term is the product of the two numbers in the expression in factored form.

· In the example above, the term 54 is the product of the two numbers -9 and -6.

Recognizing this will be helpful for switching between standard and factored forms. Remember, this pattern only occurs
when the coefficients of the -terms in the factors are 1 (because they result in a quadratic term that has a coefficient of
1 as well, ).

Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form

We have had a lot of practice rewriting factored form into standard form. To reverse this process, many of the same skills
are needed.

Let's look at an example.

  EXAMPLE 1

Write           in factored form.

To do this, we must think about how you converted from factored form into standard form. First, check if the leading
coefficient (for the quadratic term) is 1. If so, then:

· To find the coefficient of the middle term, 16, we added two numbers together from the diagram.

· To find the last term or constant, 63, we multiplied two numbers together from the diagram.

So, which numbers, and , have a sum of 16 and a product of 63?

The positive factors of 63 include:

1, 63

3, 21

7, 9

With some reasoning, we find that 7 and 9 are the numbers we want.

So, the factored form of             is               .

Let's look at another example.

EXAMPLE 2

Write           in factored form.

The sign of the middle term is negative, but we follow the same process since the coefficient of is 1.

Let's rewrite the expression as             .

Which numbers have a sum of -10 and a product of 16?

The factors of 16 include:
1336  8.6 · Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Factored Form, Part 1

      1, 16

      -1, -16

      2, 8

      -2, -8

      4, 4

      -4, -4

      The numbers we need are -2 and -8 because they have a product of 16 and a sum of -10.

      So, the factored form is             . This can be rewritten as          .

Why Should I Care?

Matteo's mom is a landscape architect. One day, she took Matteo to see the large succulent garden that she had
designed for a new hospital. She told him that the garden's area was determined using a single quadratic function.

Then, she introduced Matteo to Lucy, the accountant for the plant store where she bought the succulents. Lucy used
quadratic functions to model a demand curve and determine how to maximize profits. This allowed them to find the
most fantastic desert plants that would make the plant store the most money.

Both Matteo's mom and Lucy use quadratic functions to excel at their jobs.

Interpreting Negative Constant Terms When Factoring Quadratic Expressions

Consider the expression      . (Note the leading coefficient is 1.)

We have factored expressions like this before. We know that when the constant term is positive, the signs of the
constants in the factored form must be the same.

Since the middle term is negative, we know that both terms will be negative. So,   factors into
                     .

If the middle term was positive in the expression above, then both constants in the factored form would have been
positive.

EXAMPLE 1

Now consider the expression                . (Note the leading coefficient is 1.)
1344  8.7 · Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Factored Form, Part 2

      The constant term is a negative, -24. To find its factored form, we are searching for two numbers that have a negative
      product. This means that these two numbers must have opposite signs since multiplying a positive number and a
      negative number yields a negative product.

      Now look at the middle term, -2. We know the sum of these numbers must be -2. This means the factor with the larger
      absolute value must be negative.

      Which factors of -24 have a sum of -2? The answer is -6 and 4. Since we know that the larger value must have a negative
      sign, this confirms the factors we are searching for are -6 and 4.

      This gives a factored form of       .

      EXAMPLE 2

      Find the factored form. (Note the leading coefficient is 1.)

      The constant term is a negative, -18. To find its factored form, we are searching for two numbers that have a negative
      product.

      The middle term is 7. The same two numbers must have a sum of +7.

      Which two numbers have a product of -18 and a sum of +7?

      The numbers are 9 and -2.

      So, the factored form is         .

      FACTORED FORM, PART 3

8.8.0 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will encounter quadratic expressions without a linear term and consider how to write them in factored
form. We will begin by studying numerical examples and noticing that certain expressions are equivalent.

Remember for some digital tools, when you want to enter a number with an exponent, use the ^ symbol. It will look like
" " when you want to enter . To make the ^ symbol, push shift and the numeral 6 at the same time.

When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:

· Explain why multiplying binomials that are a sum and a difference,              , results in a quadratic expression

    with no linear term.

· Rewrite a quadratic expression of the form             into its factored form.

8.8.1 Evaluating Expressions Using Mental Math

Warm Up

Finding a product mentally can be done by changing the way you look at a multiplication problem.

For example,  can be thought of as                 . For some people, this might be easier to calculate mentally since you

can imagine the solution as      , or 351. This method leverages the distributive property of multiplication over

addition.

For the following questions, find each product mentally. Then, explain how you changed the way you looked at each
multiplication problem to use the distributive property.

1.                                                       2.

      3. Here is a shortcut that can be used to mentally

      square any two-digit number. Let's take , for

      example.

          · 83 is      .

          · Compute and , which gives 6400 and 9.
              Add these values to get 6409.

          · Compute       , which is 240. Double it to get
              480.

          · Add 6409 and 480 to get 6889.

      Try using this method to find the squares of some
      other two-digit numbers. (With some practice, it is
      possible to get really fast at this!)
      Explain why this method works.

      Recognizing the Expanded Product of the Difference of Two Squares

      Mathematically, something special happens when two binomials that are conjugates are multiplied. In other words, the

      product of an expression of the form (               results in a unique expression called a difference of two squares.

      Here are some examples of these special products.

      EXAMPLE 1

      Let's look at the expression                   . We want to determine if it is equivalent to        .

      Access for free at openstax.org

We can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition, or FOIL process, to multiply.

So,                    is equivalent to      .

EXAMPLE 2

Let's look at a different example using a variable.

Is this equivalent to  ?

This can also be shown using a diagram.
                                                                                           -7

                                                      7

You have studied this process earlier when you learned the difference of squares.

In this lesson, we will reverse this process to rewrite the standard form of a quadratic expression into its factored
form.

It is important to remember the linear term, or middle term of a quadratic trinomial, equals zero only holds true for the

difference of squares. It does not work for an expression such as                              . (In fact, there is no way to multiply two

binomials that would result in this expression.)

EXAMPLE 3

Is     equivalent to      ?

Let's find the equivalent expression for          or     .

Since                  is not equivalent to       , these expressions are not the same.

       into                .

Let's look at an example.

EXAMPLE 1

Write        in factored form.

We know that the form we are looking for is  __             __ .

Since we know the square root of is and the square root of 36 is 6, the factored form is          .

We can multiply to check our work.

                

The process is similar when there is a coefficient on the squared term.
                   factors into

Let's look at another example to understand the process.
  EXAMPLE 2

Write        in factored form.

The form we are looking for now is ( __ - __ )( __ + __ ).

Taking the square root of the first term gives us .

So, we have  __               __ .

Now, we are in the same place as in the previous example. The square root of 81 is 9.

So, the factored form is            .

Again, we can multiply to check.

                 

EXAMPLE 3

As we see in the activity, where the variable is located is not important as long as the quadratic binomial is still the
difference of two squares.

Write        in factored form.

We use the same concept to find the factored form.

We can multiply to check.

      Identifying the Number of Zeros

      How many zeros does the graph of the function                       have? How can you find out without graphing the
      function?

      Let's find the factored form of the function and solve it.

      Step 1 - Set the function equal to 0.

      Step 2 - Find the factored form.

      Step 3 - Set each factor equal to 0 and solve.

          and

      Since there are two solutions, we know that the function                            will have zeros at  and  .

      In other words, the -intercepts of the function are         and  .

      For any function, the number of solutions is equal to the number of zeros when graphed.

      Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with One Solution

      We can also find a quadratic function if we know the zeros. For example, if we want to write a quadratic function that
      has one zero or one solution, we can start with a factored form of the function representing one zero or solution.

      Any factored form of a function with a factor that repeats itself, such as          , has only one solution or one zero.

      We can graph the function                                 to check our prediction.

      We know the solution is          . Let's rewrite the function in standard form.

      Factored form:

      Multiply to find standard form:

Use the strategy you learned in the activity to
factor the expression. If the pair of factors you
selected using the leading coefficient, 6, do not
give you the correct solution, begin again with
another set of factors.
The expression is also different since the constant
term is negative, -10. This means when you
consider the factors of the constant term, one must

You have factored and solved many different types of quadratic equations, but the leading coefficient of the

Let's look at the factored form of a more complex expression to better understand the process.

  EXAMPLE 1

Write       in standard form.

To find the quadratic expression in standard form, use the distributive property of multiplication over addition, or FOIL.

Now, let's try to go the other direction from standard form to factored form.
1374  8.10 · Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Factored Form, Part 4

      EXAMPLE 2

      Write      in factored form.

      Since the leading coefficient is 2, we know the factored form must have the structure:

      Since the constant term is +15, the two missing numbers in the factored form must have a product of 15.
      The possibilities include:
      +1 and +15
      +3 and +5
      -1 and -15
      -3 and -5
      Since the middle term, , is positive, we know that only the positive factors need to be considered.

Using Technology to Find Rational Factors

Let's use graphing technology to solve a situation involving a quadratic function that cannot be solved using factoring.

A thick steel support cable at a construction site forms an arch-like shape. It starts attached to the top of a column, goes
up through a loop at a high point, and then back down to the ground.
1376  8.10 · Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Factored Form, Part 4

      The height of the cable in meters is represented by the function                where is the horizontal
      distance from the column, in meters.

      How far away from the column does the cable attach to the ground?

      The first step in solving would be to set the function equal to 0 and try to factor. Since this equation cannot be factored,
      we will use graphing technology.

      Let's graph the function using the equation                       .

      We can see the function has a zero at        . The -intercept is     .

      This means the cable attaches to the ground 4.291 meters away from the column.

      What else about the steel cable system do we know from this graph?

      We can also tell that the cable attaches to the column 5 meters off the ground at the -intercept and the loop is
      approximately 21 meters high at the vertex of the parabola.

We see that multiplying the leading coefficient by 5 would make the first term into a perfect square,      . But, we
cannot introduce a new factor that will impact the value of the expression.
We need to find a way to balance the impact of multiplying everything by 5.

Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros and a Point

Think about how you would solve the quadratic equation          .

· The factored form is                  .

· The solutions are       and        .

Now think about how you would solve                      .

· Factor out the GCF, 2.

It looks similar to the previous quadratic equation.

· The factored form is                       .

· Once again, the solutions are         and           .

Since they have the same solutions, these two quadratic equations are related. They have the same zeros and the same
axis of symmetry.

When we are reversing this process, going from the zeros of a quadratic function to finding its standard form, it is
possible there is a multiplier, such as 2 in the example above, that we do not know about.

To account for this, we use the variable as the multiplier until we find out exactly what it is.

We can incorporate into the function using the intercept form,                      . The variables and represent
the zeros or roots of the function.

Let's look at an example to help us understand.

EXAMPLE 1

Write the quadratic function, , that has the zeros -5 and 4 and passes through the point                .

We know the zeros are -5 and 4, so the factored form of the quadratic function is:

The intercept form is                   .
1390  8.11 · Writing Quadratic Equations Given Real Solutions

      We are given one more piece of information that allows us to find the value of . We know that the function passes

      through the point                .

      We can substitute -4 for and -16 for the value of the function and solve for .

      Since we know      , we can substitute 2 for into the intercept form of the quadratic function.

      The specific function that has zeros -5 and 4 and passes through the point      is:

      Let's graph the functions to check our work.

      Notice that                           and                      have the same zeros. These quadratic functions are related.
      Only                             passes through          and is the specific function we were looking for at the start.

      It is very important to note that this is why, in the previous lesson, we were looking for "a function that has zeros at -5
      and 4" and not "the function that has zeros at -5 and 4."

      This difference in wording is very important, since there are infinitely many functions that are related by their
      solutions.

      We can only determine an exact specific function if we have the additional information of a point through which the
      function passes.

Let's try one more example.
  EXAMPLE 2

Write the quadratic function, , in standard form, that has the zeros -7 and -3 and passes through the point            .

Since the zeros are -7 and -3, the factored form of the function is          .

The intercept form of the function is            .

We substitute values using the point          to find the value of .

Substitute the value of into the intercept form of the function.

The specific function that has zeros -7 and -3 and passes through the point  is:

Let's graph the functions to check our work.

Again, notice that                     and                            have the same zeros. They are related quadratic

functions.

Even though the leading coefficient is negative and the function has been reflected over the -axis, only

                    passes through            .

            hypothesize would best fit these data points?
      In this lesson, we will learn to use technology to analyze a data set, find a curve of fit, and make predictions about a
      situation given the data that we have.

        Why Should I Care?

      Safe-Rain produces equipment for some pretty amazing fountains. Some of their fountains shoot jets of water that
      can form incredible visual displays and can be synchronized to music.

      The path of a jet of water can be modeled with a quadratic function. When Safe-Rain designs a new fountain, they use
      quadratic functions to plan precisely how high and far each jet of water will go. Without quadratic equations to guide
      it, the water would spray everywhere.

      8.12.2 Finding the Curve of Best Fit

      Activity

      In a previous lesson, you learned how to find the line of best fit. A line of best fit is a line on a graph that best
      approximates the equation of the points in a data set or scatter plot.

      In this activity, we will learn how to find the curve of best fit, which is the curve modeled by the equation that best
      approximates the points in a data set or scatter plot. Since our data set is based on a quadratic function, we must use a
      curve instead of a line. This process, called quadratic regression, is the process of determining the equation of a
      parabola that best fits a data set.

      Making Predictions Using a Quadratic Model

      A filtration system is being tested in a new aquarium. A pollutant is continuously added to the aquarium, and the
      filtration system is turned on until it has removed all of the pollutant from the water.

      The following data set shows the milliliters (mL) of pollutant present, , corresponding to the number of minutes that
      have passed, , since the experiment started.

      Let's enter the instruction line,                         , to find the curve of best fit.

      The curve of best fit is determined to be                         .

      We can use this curve of best fit to answer questions and make predictions about the amount of pollutant that will be in
      the water (mL) and the time it takes to completely clean the tank of pollutant.

      How many mL of pollutant will be in the water after 12 minutes?

      · To answer this question, we want to know the -value on the curve of best fit when the -value is 12.

      · We can graph the line            and see where it intersects with the curve of best fit.

      · By moving the cursor over the intersection point, we see that the -value is approximately 507.49.

      · This means that after 12 minutes, there will be approximately 507.49 mL of pollutant in the water.

      At what time(s) will there be 1000 mL of pollutant in the water?

      · To answer this question, we want to know the -value on the curve of best fit when the -value is 1000.

      · We can graph the line            and see where it intersects with the curve of best fit.

· The line     intersects with the curve of best fit at two points. This means there are two times when there is

1000 mL of pollutant. We see that the -values are approximately 31.51 and 99.91.

· In other words, there will be 1000 mL of pollutant at approximately 31.51 minutes and again at approximately 99.91
    minutes after the experiment starts.

How long after the experiment has started will the filtration system have removed all of the pollutant from the
aquarium?

· To answer this question, we want to know the -value of the -intercept of the curve of best fit.

· If we graph    , we can click on the intersection point to find its coordinates. The -intercept of the curve of best
    fit is     .

· So, approximately 133.92 minutes after the experiment starts, there will be no pollutant left in the water.

PROJECT 8: MODELING ROCKET FLIGHT

Project 8 Overview

In this culminating project, you will use your knowledge of quadratic equations in different forms to solve problems.

In the first activity, you will be given a graph of a quadratic function and asked to write the function in factored form.
Next, you will determine how many solutions a function has based on an understanding of its factored form. You will
also be asked to explain the characteristics of the graph of a quadratic function with no solution.

In the second activity, you will work in pairs to rewrite quadratic expressions in factored and standard form using the
strategies learned in the unit.

Finally, in the third activity, you will find the specific equation in standard form of a quadratic function that has certain
zeros and passes through a particular point, given a real-world situation. Then, you will use the equation to make a
prediction about the situation, given the context of the problem.

Project Activities

 1. Relating the Graphs of Quadratic Equations to Their Factored Form by Their Zeros
 2. Converting Between Factored Form and Standard Form
 3. Modeling Rocket Flight Using a Quadratic Equation

Learning Targets

When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:

  · Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none.
  · Recognize quadratic equations that have zero, one, or two solutions when they are written in factored form.
  · Write equivalent expressions in factored form when given quadratic expressions of the form ax2 + bx + c and  is

      not 1.
  · Use the intercept form of a quadratic function to define a specific function given its zeros and a point.

Relate Zeros to the Factored Form of Quadratic Equations

In this unit, you learned about the relationship between the factored form of a quadratic equation, its zeros, and its
graph.

 1. What is the factored form of the quadratic equation represented by the graph? Explain how you found your answer.

2. How many times does the graph of the equation  intersect with the -axis? Be prepared to show

your reasoning.

3. The equation  is shown in the graph. How many solutions does the equation have? Be prepared to
1410  Project 8: Modeling Rocket Flight

      show your reasoning.

      Convert between Factored Form and Standard Form

      You have learned strategies for writing a quadratic expression in its factored form and standard form. In each round of
      this activity, you and your partner will be given equivalent quadratic expressions in different forms.
      The goal of each round is to write the quadratic expression as it has been given to your partner. If your expression is in
      factored form, write it in standard form. If your expression is in standard form, write it in factored form. At the end of
      each round, compare the expressions with your partner without revealing the expressions for future rounds.
      If, in any round, you need help, you may ask your partner to explain the next step without revealing the solution.
      Proceed from rounds 1 to 6 while discussing your thinking if there is any disagreement.

      Unit 8 Wrap Up

      Throughout this unit, you learned how to solve different quadratic equations. Equations such as these are used to model
      many different situations, such as the water arcs SafeRain creates using their water jets and fountains.
      In this unit, you interpreted, wrote, and solved quadratic equations. You found that writing and solving quadratic
      equations enabled you to find input values that produce certain output values. You started solving quadratic equations
      by reasoning and then learned to use the square root property.
      You learned that applying the zero product property to equations set equal to zero in their factored form allowed you to
      find their solutions. You developed fluency in translating quadratic equations between their standard forms and factored
      forms. You learned to easily convert these equations between their factored form and a list of their solutions or a display
      of their graph. You also found that not all equations in their standard form can easily be written into factored form.
      You learned how to find a quadratic equation in general form when given only its zeros. You explored finding a specific
      quadratic equation that has particular zeros and passes through a certain point. You discovered that there are related
      quadratic equations that share the same zeros and axis of symmetry when graphed.
      You used graphing technology to perform quadratic regression on a data set to find a curve of best fit. You used the
      curve of best fit to make predictions about a problem in a real-world context.

Unit 9 Overview

Why Should I Care?

One of the goals of a business is to make money. But how does a company ensure that it is making a profit?

Watch the video to learn how companies, like The Ensemble Theatre, use quadratic equations on a regular basis to help
them be profitable.

Access multimedia content (http://openstax.org/books/algebra-1/pages/9-unit-9-overview)
In this unit, you will learn more about quadratic equations. You will see that there are multiple methods to solving
quadratic equations. In addition to completing the square, another method is the quadratic formula. The quadratic
formula is useful for solving quadratic equations that may not be conveniently solved by completing the square. It also
provides a set formula method that can be used to solve any quadratic equation. Understanding how to use quadratic
equations is important across many industries, from managing a business to engineering. For example, engineers use
quadratic equations for designs that involve curved surfaces such as auto bodies, boats, or other vehicles.

Building Character: Intellectual Humility

In a business, such as The Ensemble Theatre, employees must learn from opposing views and have constructive
discussions in their work. Similarly, in this course, you admit when you do not know or understand something and
appreciate your classmates' and teachers' insights, and let them know when they raise a point that you hadn't
considered. Many jobs require the ability to be willing to change your mind and let people know when you do.

Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your intellectual humility. When you approach life with intellectual
humility, you open your mind to learning. You are able to learn from opposing views and have more constructive
discussions, even when you disagree. No matter how old you are, with intellectual humility you become wiser. It helps
you be less judgmental of others, learn more in school, and be a better leader.

Think about yourself. How many of these things are true?

  · I question my own opinions, positions, and viewpoints because they could be wrong.
  · I reconsider my opinions when presented with new evidence.
  · I recognize the value in opinions that are different from my own.
  · I accept that my beliefs and attitudes may be wrong.
  · In the face of conflicting evidence, I am open to changing my opinions.
  · I like finding out new information that differs from what I already think is true.

Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!

Factor Perfect Square Trinomials

Some trinomials are perfect squares. They result from multiplying a binomial times itself.

The trinomial              is called a perfect square trinomial. It is the square of the binomial     .

If you recognize that the first and last terms are squares and the trinomial fits the perfect square trinomial pattern, you
will save yourself a lot of work.

Here is the pattern: the reverse of the binomial squares pattern.

Transforming Functions

A transformation is a move to a parent (or original) function. Three types of transformations include those that cause
the graph to shift vertically or horizontally or reflect the function over the - or -axis.

Vertical Shift

Given a function , a new function                    , where is a constant, is a vertical shift of the function .

All the output values change by units. If is positive, the graph will shift up. If is negative, the graph will shift

down.

Horizontal Shift

Given a function , a new function                  , where is a constant, is a horizontal shift of the function . If

is positive, the graph will shift right. If is negative, the graph will shift left.

How to Sketch a Graph Given a Function and Both a Vertical and a Horizontal Shift

Step 1 - Identify the vertical and horizontal shifts from the formula.
Step 2 - The vertical shift results from a constant added to the output. Move the graph up for a positive constant and
down for a negative constant.
Step 3 - The horizontal shift results from a constant subtracted from the input. Move the graph right for a positive
constant and left for a negative constant.
Step 4 - Apply the shifts to the graph in either order.

Reflections                                         is a vertical reflection of the function , sometimes called a

Find the Value to Make a Perfect Square and Solve

In earlier lessons, we worked with perfect squares such as      and          . We learned that their equivalent

expressions in standard form follow a predictable pattern:

    · In general,               can be written as            .
1450  9.4 · Completing the Square, Part 3

      · If a quadratic expression of the form               is a perfect square, and the value of is 1, then the value of is

             , and the value of is for some value of .

      In this lesson, the variable in the factors being squared had a coefficient other than 1, for example  and

                   . Their equivalent expression in standard form also followed the same pattern we saw earlier.

      In general,        can be written as:

                                or

      · the value of is
      · the value of is
      · the value of is

      We can use this pattern to help us complete the square and solve equations when the squared term       has a coefficient

      other than 1--for example:                       .

      What constant term can we add to make the expression on the left of the equal sign a perfect square? And how do we
      write this expression as squared factors?

      · 16 is , so the squared factors could be             .

      · 40 is equal to          , so            or          . This means that  .

      · If is , then                   or  .

      · So the expression                       is a perfect square and is equivalent to      .

      Let's solve the equation                  by completing the square!

      Step 1 -

      To be a perfect square,              is needed.

      We found the by determining the square root of the first term,            .
                                                                               (from the coefficient of the linear term), we
      Step 2 -

      Now, find the value of to make a perfect square.

      Since        , and we know that           (from step 1), and that

      Solving Quadratics with Radical Solutions

      When solving quadratic equations, it is important to remember that:

      · Any positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative, because there are two numbers that can

          be squared to make that number. (For example, and          both equal 36, so 6 and -6 are both square roots of 36.)

      · The square root symbol         can be used to express the positive square root of a number. For example, the square

          root of 36 is 6, but it can also be written as    because        .

      · To express the negative square root of a number, say 36, we can write -6 or  .

      · When a number is not a perfect square (for example, 40), we can express its square roots by writing  and

          .

      How could we write the solutions to an equation like           ? This equation is saying, "something squared is 11."

Why Should I Care?

The Ensemble Theatre is exploiting two ancient practices in new and exciting ways. Those ancient practices are
quadratic equations and live theatre. Running a live theatre company requires many things, and one of the most
important is the old tool called the quadratic function.

The theatre can use quadratic functions to determine ticket price to maximize the profit. Ticket prices need to be set
high enough to recoup the cost of expenses and generate revenue while still being a price point that attracts
customers.

The vertex of the parabola that represents the Ensemble Theatre's ticket price can tell us at what ticket price they can
sell the most tickets and maximize the revenue.

A General Way to Derive the Quadratic Formula

Here is another way to look at how to derive the quadratic formula:

We can derive the quadratic formula by completing the square. We will assume that the leading coefficient is positive; if

it is negative, we can multiply the equation by -1 and obtain a positive . Given            ,        , we will

complete the square as follows:

Step 1 - First, move the constant term to the right side of the equal sign:

Step 2 - As we want the leading coefficient to equal 1, divide through by :

Step 3 - Then, find of the middle term, and add           to both sides of the equal sign:

Step 4 - Next, write the left side as a perfect square. Find the common denominator of the right side and write it as a
single fraction:

Step 5 - Now, use the square root property, which gives:

           ±

              ±

Step 6 - Finally, add  to both sides of the equation and combine the terms on the right side. Thus:

          number other than 0, and when squared,         will be positive.

In this culminating project, you will synthesize methods of solving quadratic equations and graphing quadratic functions
to answer questions about within a context. You will use tools learned throughout the unit to grapple with solving
problems about a quadratic function that represents a context. Since this work requires using what you know to tackle
an unfamiliar problem, you will need to make sense of problems and demonstrate perseverance.

Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for you to choose to use appropriate technology to
solve problems.

      Unit 9 Wrap Up

      In this unit, you learned how companies like The Ensemble Theatre use quadratic equations to solve problems. Business
      managers use quadratics to represent revenue as a product of the price of a ticket and the quantity sold. Quadratic
      equations can also be used to predict profit and loss. Other companies use quadratics to determine the best materials to
      use or to determine which dimensions will be best to maximize a given space.

      Building Character: Intellectual Humility

      Throughout this unit, you learned how to solve quadratic equations using the methods of completing the square and the
      quadratic formula. You also learned how to use graphs and other methods to check your solutions.
      Finally, you wrote quadratic expressions in vertex form to identify the vertex as well as the maximum or minimum value
      of the quadratic function. This value was then used to solve real-life problems involving the maximum revenue.

               you learned during this unit. Congratulations on completing Unit 9!

      Throughout this unit, you learned that intellectual humility is important for recognizing the limitations of your
      knowledge. You learned that when you approach life with intellectual humility, you open your mind to learning. You are
      able to learn from opposing views and have more constructive discussions, even when you disagree. You learned that no
      matter how old you are, with intellectual humility, you become wiser. It helps you be less judgmental of others, learn
      more in school, and be a better leader.
