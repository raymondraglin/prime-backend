1. Would you rather have 3500 Mexican Pesos or 210 Euros? Justify your answer. The current
    exchange rates are 1 Euro to 1.08 US dollars and 1 Peso to 0.057 US dollars.
    3500 Pesos ($0.057/1 Peso) = $199.50
    210 Euros ($1.08/1 Euro) = $226.80. I would rather have the Euros because they are
    worth more.

2. A certain shade of green paint is made from 5 parts yellow mixed with 2 parts blue. If you

have 2 cans of yellow paint, how much blue paint do you need?

 parts yellow =  cans yellow,  5x = 4, x=4/5 of a can of blue paint.
 parts blue      cans blue

6. Finance problems. Use Excel to calculate the     Financial Formulas Provided
    value for each problem. Write the Excel         =principal + principal*rate*years
    syntax and your answer rounded to the           =FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])
    nearest cent. Write each answer in a complete   =principal*EXP(rate*years)
    sentence.                                       =PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])
                                                    =EFFECT(nominal rate, periods per year)
    a. Luisa needs to start saving for retirement.  =PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type])
         She can afford to deposit $90 every
         month, into an account paying 5.36% APR,
         compounded monthly. Find the balance
         in the account after 29 years.
         =FV(0.0536/12, 29*12, 90, 0)
         =$74,872.52
         Luisa will have $74,872.52 in 29 years.

b. Jonah is purchasing a 2016 Dodge Challenger for $32,750. He plans to put $4,500 cash
    down, and finance the remainder at 9.35% APR, compounded monthly, for seven years.
    Find his monthly car payment. How much will Jonah pay in total for the car?
    $32,750 - $4,500 = $28,250 for the amount of the loan

=PMT(0.0935/12, 7*12, 28250, 0)
=$459.55
Jonah's car payment is $459.55.
He will pay $4500 + 7*12*$459.55 = $43,102.20 for the car

c. Charles deposited $2,800 into an account paying 7.15% APR, compounded daily. Find the
    balance in this account after 15 years.

=FV(0.0715/365, 15*365, 0, 2800)
=$8,182.64

Charles will have $8,182.64 in 15 years.

d. Trung deposited $1200 into a savings account paying 6.5% APR, compounded
    continuously. Find his account balance after 15 years. What percentage of that is interest?

=1200*exp(0.065*15) = $3,181.40
=$3,181.40 - $1,200 = $1,981.40 interest, $1,981.40/3,181.40 = .623 or 62.3%
Trung will have $3,181.40 in 15 years.

e. May is comparing two different accounts. One is 6.3% compounded quarterly and the
    other is 5.5% compounded daily. Calculate the effective rate of each and state which
    account will earn more money.

=effect(0.063, 4)       =effect(0.055, 365)

=0.0645                 =0.0565

The quarterly compounded rate of 6.3% is better because it has a higher annual

interest rate of 6.45%

7. Use the 2024 tax tables to answer the tax questions. The tables will be given with the test.
    Write your answers in complete sentences.

    a. Manuel is filing as head of household and has $22,500 in itemized deductions. Should he
         claim the itemized deductions or the standard deduction? How much would his
         deduction be?

         The standard deduction from the table is $21,900. He should use his itemized
         deductions because they are higher.

b. Jessie and Sam are married filing jointly with two kids. They have a gross income of
    $104,100 and $21,000 in itemized deductions. Determine their deduction and calculate
    their taxable income.

       $104,100 - $29,200 (Standard deduction of $29,200 is higher)
    = $104,100 - $29,200
    = $74,900
    The taxable income for Jessie and Sam is $74,900.

c. Bill is single with a taxable income of $35,100. Calculate the amount of tax owed using

the table.                                (you can write the steps out in a

                                          different way, just show your work)

          $1,160 + 0.12(35,100 - 11,600)

= $1,160 + 0.12($23,500)

= $1,160 + 2,820

= $3,980

Bill owes $3,980 in taxes.

d. Kole had $6,210 deducted from their paychecks in withholdings. Their taxes owed came
    out to be $5,598. Does Kole get a refund or owe money and what is the amount?

    $6,210 - $5,598 = $612
    Kole had more deducted from their paychecks than they owe, so they get a refund
    of $612.

8. Identify the sampling method:
    a. Researchers select every 5th customer who walks into the store to take a survey.
         Systematic sample

    b. Raffle tickets are distributed and collected in a bag, where they are mixed and ten are
         drawn for prizes.
         Simple Random Sample

    c. I asked the shoppers near me in the shoe department what size they wear.
         Convenience Sample

    d. An IRS auditor randomly selects 25 taxpayers in each filing status (single, head of
         household, married filing jointly, and married filing separately).
         Stratified (by filing type)

9. Write the type of study, describe the control group (if any), the treatment group and whether
    there is any blinding and the type.

    a. A study was done on a new heart medication, where some patients would receive the
         medication and others would receive a placebo, without knowing to which group they
         belonged. The nurse who was dispensing the pills was given the pills for each patient and
         couldn't tell the difference.
         This is an experiment. The treatment group received the medication and the
         control group received the placebo. This experiment is double-blind because there
         is a placebo used and the nurse does not know who is receiving each treatment.

    b. A study assigned one group of participants to try a new moisturizing cream on their
         hands, and the other group was instructed not to use any cream. This new cream was
         predicted to help extremely dry skin.
         This is an experiment. The treatment group uses the cream and the control group
         does not. A placebo is not used so the participants are not blinded.

    c. A study was done to find the average height of each NBA team's players.
         This is an observational study (not case-controlled).

    d. A study was done to try a new dog food, and the dog owners were given cans with the
         labels removed. The person handing out the dog food knew which type was given.
         This is an experiment. The treatment group is the dogs receiving the new food and
         the control group gets a different type of food. The study is single-blind because
         the owners do not know which type of food they are getting for their dogs. The
         person handing out the food does know.

10. In a CNN poll of 500 adults nationwide, 62% of those surveyed answered yes to the
    following question, "Do you favor a law to ban the sale of assault weapons and
    semiautomatic rifles?" The margin of error was 4.4%. Write the confidence interval. Would
    you claim that a majority of Americans support such a law?

62% ± 4.4%
(62-4.4, 62+4.4)
(57.6%, 66.4%)
The full confidence interval is over 50% so we could claim that a majority of
Americans support having the law.

11. List the type of bias in each study.
    a. PCC students were sent an email survey to determine how long to keep the computer lab
         open in the evenings.
         This study is subject to voluntary response bias because students choose whether to
         respond and the sample may not be representative of the population. You could
         also say selection bias because an email survey is not a good way to survey people
         about computer access.
    b. Campus officials want to know how many PCC students have experienced housing
         insecurity so they poll students at Sylvania and Rock Creek campuses.
         This study is subject to selection bias. Students at SE and Cascade were not
         surveyed so the sample will not be representative of the PCC student population.

12. Old Faithful (geyser in Yellowstone Park) typically erupts nearly 20 times per day for about
    1.5 to 5 minutes in duration each time. The amount of time between eruptions varies but is
    fairly regular. For May 30, 2016, the time between eruptions was recorded (in minutes):

97, 88, 91, 95, 90, 100, 107, 85, 93, 103, 99, 107, 90, 94, 90

14. The probability distribution for the amount of money an insurance company pays in claims
    per customer per year is given below.

a. Calculate the expected payout for the insurance company per customer, including units.

            Payout     $20,000   $15,000     $1,000  $500       $0
          Probability   0.001     0.003       0.09   0.05      0.856

$20,000(0.001) + $15,000(0.003) + $1,000(0.09) + $500(0.05) + $0(0.0856)

= $20                  +  $45           + $90 + $25 + $0                  = $180

The expected or average amount the insurance company pays per customer is $180.

b. If the insurance policy sells for $599 per year, what is the expected profit or loss for the
    company? Write your answer in a complete sentence.
    $599 - $180 = $419

The insurance company makes an average of $419 per policy per year.
