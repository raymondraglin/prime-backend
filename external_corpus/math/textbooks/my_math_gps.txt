Linear Equations and Inequalities

GPS 1: Understanding Linear Equations

When we think about equations, we usually think of numbers, variables, and symbols.

                                                          2 + 9 = 4 + 3

The diagram below also represents the equation above. Here we visualize the equation as a balance with each
side weighing the same.

!!!!  !!!! !!!!

!!!!  !!!! !!!!

                                                             =

It is likely that everyone has used a balance at some point. You may have used one in a science lab or when
playing with a seesaw on a playground. Based on your experience using a balance, you know it would very easy
to determine the weight of one !!!! block if the picture looked like the one below.

                                   !!!!

                                                              =

Solving an equation is very similar the process of moving blocks on a balance to determine the weight of the
unknown block. Here are a few observations you likely made about balances. These are very similar to the rules
you may recall learning from working with equations.

    1) The balance will only be level if both sides weigh exactly the same.
    2) If you add weight to one side, then to keep it level you must add the same weight to the other side.
    3) If you remove weight from one side, then to keep it level you must remove the same weight from the

         other side.
Let's see how we can perform a sequence of moves so that we are left with a single !!!! on one side of the
balance and a weight we know on the other side. We will show how each step is represented algebraically.

Problem 1.1

Solve for . Check your solution.

                                        2 + 9 = 4 + 3

In each step, we draw the starting and ending picture of the balance. We also show the corresponding starting
and ending equation.

                                        This is our starting
                                        point.

   !!!!                      !!!! !!!!  Our first goal is to
   !!!!                      !!!! !!!!  get all the !!!! on
                                        one side of the
                      =                 balance, and the unit
                                        blocks on the
                                        opposite side.

   !!!!                      !!!! !!!!  Remove two !!!!                    2 + 9 = 4 + 3
   !!!!                      !!!! !!!!  from each side of the
                                        balance.                         2 -  + 9 = 4 -  + 3
                      =
                                        This is the same as                       9 = 2 + 3
                             !!!! !!!!  subtracting 2 from
                             !!!! !!!!  both sides of the
                                        equation.
                      =
                                        After this step, the
                                        !!!! are only on one
                                        side of the balance.

          !!!!                                  We see that each             3 = 
                                                !!!! weighs 3 units.          = 3
                              =                 We ordinarily write
                                                our solutions as
                                                 = 3, rather than
                                                3 = . We see this is
                                                like exchanging the
                                                left and right sides of
                                                the balance.

We think each !!!! weighs 3. We can check that our solution is correct by going back to the original balance and
calculating the weight of each side. If we are correct, then both sides will weigh the same.

Check:

                                                to 3, and then                    15 = 15

                                                We see that each

                                                weighs the same. We

GPS 2: Solving Linear Equations with Whole Numbers

In the last section we learned a different way to think about the process of solving and checking linear
equations. In this section, we will continue to practice solving equations without drawing the pictures.

Problem 2.1

Solve for . Check your solution.

                                  3 + 14 = 8 + 4

Our goal is to move all the variable terms to one side, and all the terms without variables to the opposite side.
We have four choices how to start this problem. But after we make our first choice, we do not have any more
reasonable choices of what to do for the remainder of the problem. We will revisit each of the three remaining
choices next. For now, we will move the 3 to the right side with the 8.

                   3 + 14 = 8 + 4     This is the original problem.
                                      Subtract 3 from both sides.
            3 -  + 14 = 8 -  + 4      Simplify.
                                      Subtract 4 from both sides from both sides.
                          14 = 5 + 4  Simplify.
                                      Divide both sides by 5.
                    14 -  = 5 + 4 - 
                                      Simplify.
                          10 = 5      Reverse the order of the equality.
                          10 = 5
                           55

                           2 = 
                            = 2

Check:

To check, we will substitute our solution into the original equation. If we are correct, then we will get a true

statement.

                                  3 + 14 = 8 + 4

                                  3(2) + 14=? 8(2) + 4

                                  6 + 14=? 16 + 4

                                      20 = 20 

Since we arrived at the true statement 20 = 20, we know that our answer is correct.


In the previous problem, we commented that we had four choices how to start this problem. We elected to start
by subtracting 3 from each side. The result of this was that our variables were moved to the right of the equal
sign. Once we choose to move the variables to the right, we had no reasonable choice except to move the terms
without variables to the left. Let's see the three other choices now before doing one on your own.

First subtract 4 from both sides.     First subtract 8 from both sides. First subtract 14 from both sides.

    3 + 14 = 8 + 4                    3 + 14 = 8 + 4                      3 + 14 = 8 + 4

    3 + 14 -  = 8 + 4 -               3 -  + 14 = 8 -  + 4  3 + 14 -  = 8 + 4 - 

    3 + 10 = 8                        -5 + 14 = 4                                        3 = 8 - 10

    3 -  + 10 = 8 -                   -5 + 14 -  = 4 -                    3 -  = 8 -  - 10

    10 = 5                            -5 = -10                                           -5 = -10

    10 = 5                            -5 = -10                                           -5 = -10
    55                                -5 -5                                              -5 -5
     2 = 
                                          = 2                                                = 2

     = 2

As you can observe, in each of the four choices, we arrived at the same correct answer.

Which of the four ways do you prefer? If they all arrived at the correct answer, how will you decide which one
you to do first? To help answer these questions, it may be helpful to attempt drawing the balance diagrams that
would accompany each solution method.

The Distributive Property

Often equations involve parentheses that you must understand to solve the problem. For example,

                                    2(3 + 4) = 11 + 3

What does 2(3 + 4) mean? One way to think about this is that you have 2 groups of 3 + 4. Let us return to

the diagrams we were drawing in the previous section. In this section we learned we could represent 3 + 4 as

follows

         3 + 4                 !!!! !!!! !!!!

If we have 2 groups of 3 + 4, it would thus look like this

         2(3 + 4)              !!!! !!!! !!!!                                       6 + 8
                               !!!! !!!! !!!!

The outcome is that there are 2 times the number of 's and 2 times the number of 1 blocks. This is an example

of the Distributive Property.

         The Distributive Property                                                               PB

                                    ( + ) =  + 

         In words, this property says that to multiply a quantity by multiple quantities

         added (or subtracted!) inside parentheses, multiply each piece inside the

         parentheses by the piece outside the parentheses.

         A common diagram for this property is as follows:

                          ( + ) =  +

Problem 2.7

Solve for . Check your solution.

                                  2(3 + 4) = 11 + 3

Our first goal when solving equations is often to simplify each side. In this case, this means applying the
Distributive Property. We then proceed as usual.

                2(3 + 4) = 11 + 3     This is the original problem.
            2(3) + 2(4) = 11 + 3      Apply the Distributive Property.
                                      Simplify.
                    6 + 8 = 11 + 3    Subtract 6 from both sides.
             6 -  + 8 = 11 -  + 3     Simplify
                                      Subtract 3 from both sides from both sides.
                           8 = 5 + 3  Simplify.
                     8 -  = 5 + 3 -   Divide both sides by 5.

                           5 = 5      Simplify.
                           5 = 5      Reverse the order of the equality.

To check, we will still substitute our solution into the original equation. If we are correct, then we will get a true

statement.

                                  2(3 + 4) = 11 + 3

                                  2(3(1) + 4)=? 11(1) + 3

                                  2(3 + 4)=? 11 + 3

                                      2(7)=? 14

GPS 3: Adding Signed Numbers

In the previous sections, you were likely able to avoid doing any calculations with negative numbers. This will
not be the case any longer. We must revisit signed numbers and arithmetic.

Much of the confusion with addition and subtraction of signed numbers stems from the symbols + and - and
their multiple uses with different, although related, meanings.

The + symbol can mean either the operation addition or that the sign of the following number is positive.

                     This is what we write                   This is what we mean

                                   5+3                       (+5) + (+3)

The 5 and 3 are both positive numbers, but we do not ordinarily write the positive symbol since by customary

notation, numbers without a sign are positive. The + between the numbers indicates that we are adding them.

Finally, we complicate the notation by putting parentheses around the numbers to group the sign with the

number.

The - symbol can mean either the operation subtraction or that the sign of the following number is negative. In

typing, the symbol is sometimes longer - or shorter - depending on the context, but you cannot depend on this

distinction to determine meaning.

                     This is what we write                   This is what we mean

                                   6-2                       (+6) - (+2)

In this example, the 6 and 2 are again both positive numbers. The - symbol between them means subtraction.

We will see shortly that this - symbol can also have an alternative meaning.

Here is a sequence of examples, their meaning, and results.

Almost certainly, the last four rows were the most problematic to determine the result. This is because
subtraction combined with signed numbers offers an opportunity to showcase confused ideas, partially recalled
rules and wrong calculations all at once. We will show you how to think differently about subtraction soon, but
first we will look more closely at addition.

Addition of Two Signed Numbers
There are many ways to think about addition, and ideally you have many, flexible ways of understanding
addition. In the problems below, we will use the concept of addition as combining quantities and finding the
total.

For these problems, we can imagine a positive number represents money in our pocket (or bank account), and a
negative number represents money we owe someone (a debt or a bill). The first number in the addition
represents how much money we have at the beginning. The second number can represent what we are
combining--it may be more money (a positive number) or a new debt Let's see how this can help us think about
addition of signed numbers.

Problem 3.3                                           Problem 3.4

                              3+2                                                  -5 + 8
We have already seen that this really means           This means

                         (+3) + (+2)                                           (-5) + (+8)
The scenario we can imagine goes as follows:          Here the scenario changes:

    1) I have 3 dollars in my pocket.                     1) I start out in debt 5 dollars.
    2) I then earn 2 dollars more.                        2) I then earn 8 dollars.
    3) Altogether, I have 5 dollars in my pocket.         3) After paying my 5 dollar debt with my 8
This leads us to the answer.
                                                               dollars, I have 3 dollars in my pocket.
                           3+2=5                      The answer is

                                                                                -5 + 8 = 3

We can think of this as                           This is the worst scenario:

1) I start out in debt 6 dollars.                 1) I start out in debt 9 dollars.

2) I then earn 4 dollars.                         2) I go shopping and get 7 dollars more debt.

3) After paying the 4 dollars toward my 6 dollar  3) After the new 7 dollar debt is combined with

debt, I still owe 2 dollars.                      my 9 dollar debt, I am a total of 16 dollars in

The answer:                                       debt.

Addition of Multiple Terms
Often there are more than two terms that we must add together. We still add only two numbers at a time.

Problem 3.27

                                     -3 + (-5) + 9 + (-12)

When there are multiple terms to add, it is important to organize yourself. Here, I will work left to right and
ensure I do only one operation at a time. At each step, as annoying as it is continually write the same thing over,
is best that you bring everything down and rewrite the problem.

  -3+(-5) + 9 + (-12) We start with the first computation on the left

  - + 9 + (-12)                      We replace the underlined part with the result of the computation,
  -8+9 + (-12)                       and carefully bring everything else down.
                                     We again complete the first computation on the left.

               + (-12)               We replace the underlined part with the result of the computation,
              1+(-12)                and carefully bring everything else down.
                                     There is only one computation remaining.

              -11                    This is the answer.



              Students often make mistakes due to some bad habits.                              IN

              1. Don't perform more than one operation per step. While this is possible

                   to do correctly, much care must be taken. It is best to start out more

                   slowly, and get the correct answer. You probably hate it when your

                   instructor "skips steps," so don't do it yourself!

              2. Bring down the entire problem after each step. It is extremely easy to

                   lose track of the problem, and make many mistakes because you don't

                   take care to rewrite at each step. In this book, there is ample room to

                   write each step. Not using the space is wasting the paper.

GPS 4: Subtracting Signed Numbers

In the last section we increased our understanding of addition of signed numbers. Using what we learned about
addition, we can also perform subtraction. It all comes down to this one fact.

Subtraction                                                                                     AA

To subtract  from , add the opposite of  to .

                                                -  =  + (-)

This is a different interpretation of subtraction than you might customarily think about. Instead of thinking
about subtraction as "taking away" or "removing", we think of it as adding the opposite. We need to know how
to find the opposite. Simply put, the opposite of a positive number is the negative number of the same
magnitude, and the opposite of a negative number is the positive number with the same magnitude.

Problem 4.1                                                  2) The opposite of 2 is -2.

   Problem 4.2

         1) The opposite of 50 is ______.

         3) The opposite of 12 is ______.
    

Subtraction of Two Signed Numbers
Now we will apply these ideas to subtraction.

Rewrite the problem without changing it.                     Problem 4.3       Problem 4.4
Do both of these steps at once:
1) Change the operation to addition.                                  4-9             6 - (-8)
2) Change the second number to its opposite.                     (+4) - (+9)       (+6) - (-8)
Calculate the answer as we learned in the previous section.

Do both of these steps at once:
1) Change the operation to addition.                               -24 - 18         -15 - (-9)
2) Change the second number to its opposite.                    (-24) - (+18)     (-15) - (-9)
Calculate the answer as we learned in the previous section.

Addition and Subtraction of Multiple Terms
Just as in the previous section, we must often add and subtract multiple terms at once.

The Order of Operations dictates that when performing more than one                      AA

addition and subtraction, you should complete them from left to right. While it is

possible to disobey this strict order, it requires more care than many students

have mastered. For now, stick to this requirement!

Problem 4.23

                                     3 - 5 - (-8) + 6 - 20

We will work left to right and perform only one operation at a time.

  3-5 - (-8) + 6 - 20                We start with the first computation on the left. While you may not
   - - (-8) + 6 - 20                 explicitly write this, recall that

                                                                   3 - 5 = 3 + (-5)
                                     We replace the underlined part with the result of the computation,
                                     and carefully bring everything else down.

  -2-(-8) + 6 - 20                   In this case, you would be well advised to make the substitution of
                                     subtraction for addition, before performing any computations.

  -+(+) + 6 - 20                     We did not perform any calculations, but we rewrote the
                                     expression to make it easier to complete the problem correctly.

               + 6 - 20              We performed the calculation and brought everything else down.
              6+6 - 20               We now work left to right and perform the next operation.

               - 20                  We replace the underlined part with the result of the computation,
                                     and carefully bring everything else down.

                                     There is only one computation left. Again, you may not explicitly

              12-20                  write this, but recall that

                                                          12 - 20 = 12 + (-20)

              -8                     This is the answer.

GPS 5: Multiplying and Dividing Signed Numbers

After learning about addition and subtraction, it should be obvious that multiplication and division are next.

Multiplication and Division of Two Signed Numbers
Unlike addition and subtraction of signed numbers, multiplication and division of signed numbers only differs
from working with only positive numbers when determining the sign of the answer, rather than the magnitude.

Steps for Performing Multiplication and Division of Signed Numbers
    1) Ignore all signs and perform the operation with the positive numbers.
    2) Determine the correct sign of the answer.

While the steps above are simple enough to state, the second step requires further explanation. For this step,
you may find it helpful to think of a negative sign as meaning "take the opposite of the number." If there are
multiple negative signs, then you must take the opposite multiple times.

Problem 5.1                                                     Explanation

              Problem   There are no negatives so the answer is positive.
             5  3 = 15
         (-6)  4 = -24  6  4 = 24. There is one negative number. This means we must take the
                        opposite of 24 once to find the final answer. The opposite of 24 is -24.
         7  (-8) = -56
                        7  8 = 56. There is one negative number. We take the opposite of 56 one
         (-6)(-8) = 48  time and the final answer is -56.

               18       6  8 = 48. There are two negative numbers. We must take the opposite of
                9 =2    48 two times. The opposite of 48 is -48, but we must take the opposite
            -36 = -3    again. The opposite of -48 is 48.
              12
              63        There are no negatives so the answer is positive.
             -9 = -7
              -40 = 8   36  12 = 3. There is one negative number. We must take the opposite of 3
              -5        one time and arrive at -3.

                        63  9 = 7. There is one negative. We must take the opposite of 7 once to
                        get -7.

                        40  5 = 8. There are two negative numbers. We take the opposite two
                        times. The opposite of 8 is -8, and the opposite of -8 is 8.

You may like to take a few moments to look for patterns about the sign of the the answer when the two
numbers have the same sign, and the sign of the answer when the two numbers have the opposite sign.

Multiple Operations of Signed Numbers
Often we must perform combinations of multiple operations rather than just do a single multiplication or a
single division. You have already done this a few times when checking solutions in previous problems. We will
practice a few more here.

    Order of Operations for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division                    AA

                    1) First, complete all operations inside any parentheses. You should

                      continue to work inside the parentheses until there is only one number

                      remaining.

                    2) Second, complete multiplication and division. Perform all multiplications

                      and divisions from left to right.

                    3) Finally, complete addition and subtraction. Perform all additions and

                      subtractions from left to right.

                     Note that we did not include exponents in this order since we will not
                    encounter exponents until later.

Problem 5.11

                                  -3(2(-4) + 6) - 7 + 9

-3(2(-4) + 6) - 7 + 9             We start working with the inside parentheses. Our first goal will be
                                  to completely simplify 2(-4) + 6 but we will do this one operation
-3 2(-4) + 6 - 7 + 9              at a time. We will also carefully bring down the entire problem at
  -3(- + 6) - 7 + 9               each step.
  -3 -8+6 - 7 + 9                 We first complete the multiplication.
     -3(-) - 7 + 9
                                  We replace the underlined part with the result of the computation,
     -3(-2) - 7 + 9               and carefully bring everything else down.
                                  Next we perform the addition inside the parentheses.
         6-7+9
         6-7 + 9                  We replace the underlined part with the result of the computation,
                                  and carefully bring everything else down.
           -1 + 9                 Inside the parentheses is only a single number with no operations.
              8                   We now look outside the parentheses. We complete the
                                  multiplication first.
                                  We replace the underlined part with the result of the computation,
                                  and carefully bring everything else down.
                                  At this point we perform the subtraction because it is first when
                                  reading from left to right. Recall that 6 - 7 = 6 + (-7)
                                  We replace the underlined part with the result of the computation,
                                  and carefully bring everything else down.
                                  There is only one operation remaining, and we perform it now. This
                                  is the answer.

GPS 6: Solving Linear Equations with Signed Numbers

This section does not contain anything new. However, you will not be able to avoid performing arithmetic with
negative numbers in this section.

Problem 6.1

Solve for . Check your solution.

                                         -3 + 4 = 2 + 19

We proceed as in the previous sections.

                   -3 + 4 = 2 + 19       This is the original problem.
            -3 +  + 4 = 2 +  + 19        Add 3 to both sides.
                                         Simplify.
                            4 = 5 + 19   Subtract 19 from both sides from both sides.
                     4 -  = 5 + 19 -     Simplify.
                                         Divide both sides by 5.
                        -15 = 5
                        -15 = 5          Simplify.
                                         Reverse the order of the equality.
                           
                          -3 = 

                             = -3

Check:

To check, we will substitute our solution into the original equation. If we are correct, then we will get a true

statement.

                                         -3 + 4 = 2 + 19

                                         -3(-3) + 4=? 2(-3) + 19

                                         9 + 4=? - 6 + 19

                                         13 = 13 

Since we arrived at the true statement 13 = 13, we know that our answer is correct.

Problem 7.1

If  represents a number, write an equation that is a correct translation of the sentence. Then find the number.
                                                The sum of a number and  is .

We see several key words that indicate how to write the equation.

                           The sum of a number and  is .

                           +                                         5 = 13

We must put these symbols together in the proper order. Sometimes the order of the words is not the same as

the order of the symbols. Here the word sum comes before the two symbols it should be placed between. We

group the words into larger phrases to help us put the symbols together in the correct order.

                                           The sum of a number and   is .
                                                           + 5       = 13

The equation can be written down.

                               + 5 = 13

Let's solve our equation.

                               + 5 = 13

                               + 5 -  = 13 - 

                                                          = 8

Check:

We can check this answer by substituting the answer into the original sentence, and see if it makes sense.

                              The sum of  and  is 

This sentence is correct, and so our answer is correct.



   Problem 7.2                                              Problem 7.3

                                                                              the number and .

Some words are trickier to get the order correct than others. This is particularly true with subtraction.

Problem 7.4

If  represents a number, write an equation that is a correct translation of the sentence. Then find the number.
                     The product of a number and - is equal to  less than twice the number.

We start by breaking the sentence into smaller pieces and determine their corresponding symbols.

The product of a number and - is equal to  less than twice the number

      -5                                              =  14            -                       2

When we recombine the pieces to put the operations in their proper order, we pay particular attention to the

phrase "less than" which again reverses the order that the numbers appear.

The product of a number and - is equal to                  less than twice the number
                                                                        2 - 14
   -5                                                  =

We now combine this into an equation, and solve for .

                                                           -5 = 2 - 14

                                                    -5 -  = 2 -  - 14

                                                           -7 = -14
                                                           -7 = -14
                                                            - -

                                                                = 2


Students often confuse the order with certain phrases that mean subtraction. Be IN
careful with all subtractions and make sure you have the order correct. It is often
helpful to substitute some actual numbers into the words to help.
For example:
3 less than 5 is 2 translates to 5 - 3 = 2. You can recognize immediately that
3 - 5  2.

GPS 8: Solving Linear Inequalities, Part 1

Until this point we have worked only with equations where both sides are equal. Sometimes both sides are not
equal, and one side is bigger or smaller than the other side. For these situations we use the idea of inequalities.
We have new symbols to learn here as well.

None of the examples above have any variables. Here are some examples of inequalities that include variables
as well as how we can graph them.

Problem 8.1

Graph the inequality.

                                             < 4

Here is the graph. We have shaded the part of the number line where the inequality is true.

                                                    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Here is how we determined how to draw the graph.
1) Determine the endpoint. In the first few problems, this is easy to see. We see the  = 4 is the endpoint.

    There is an open hollow (unshaded) circle at the endpoint  = 4 because when we substitute  = 4 into the
    inequality  < 4, we get 4 < 4 which is not true.
2) We shaded the left of 4. Here's how we figured this out.

         a. Pick any point to the left of 4. Let's pick  = 1.
         b. Substitute the point into the inequality  < 4. We get 1 < 4. This is a true statement, and so we

              shaded to the left.
3) We did not shade the right of 4.

         a. Pick any point to the right of 4. Let's pick  = 5.
         b. Substitute the point into the inequality  < 4. We get 5 < 4. This is not a true statement, and so we

              did not shade to the right.

Problem 8.2               -2  

Graph the inequality.

Here is the graph.

                                                    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Here is how we determined how to draw the graph. Again, our goal is to shade the points on the numberline
where the inequality is true.
1) There is a closed shaded circle at the endpoint  = -2 because when we substitute  = -2 into the the

    original inequality -2  , we get -2  -2 which is true.
2) We did not shade the left of -2.

         a. Pick any point to the left of -2. Let's pick  = -5.
         b. Substitute the point into the inequality -2  . We get -2  -5. This is not a true statement, and

              so we did not shade to the left.
3) We shaded the right of -2.

         a. Pick any point to the right of -2. Let's pick  = 0.
         b. Substitute the point into the inequality -2  . We get -2  0. This is a true statement, and so we

              shaded to the right.



   Problem 8.3

Graph the inequality. Then answer the questions below.
                                                                  > 1

1) The endpoint is  =_______. Will you use an open (hollow) or closed (shaded) circle at the endpoint? Why?

2) Will you shade to the left of the endpoint? Why? To answer this completely, do the following.
         a. Pick any point to the left of the endpoint. What number did you pick?  =______
         b. Substitute the number you picked into the original inequality. What is the inequality you get after
              substituting? ________ Is this inequality true? _______. Will you shade to the left? ________

3) Will you shade to the right of the endpoint? Why? Follow a similar procedure as in part 2). This time, write
    your answer in complete sentences explaining why you will or will not shade to the right.

   Problem 8.4

Answer the questions below. Then graph the inequality.
                                                                -1

All of the inequalities we have graphed thus far had the variable  all by itself on one side. This made it very easy
to determine the endpoint of our graphs. We now add an additional type of problem where the inequality is not
so simplified.

54                    GPS 8: Solving Linear Inequalities, Part 1

Problem 8.5

Graph the solution to the inequality.
                                                             2 + 5  11

We will follow the same four step approach as in the previous problems, but we must do additional work in the
first step to determine the endpoint of our graph.
1) Determine the endpoint by changing the inequality symbol to an equals symbol and solve.

                                                                2 + 5 = 11
                                                          2 + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5

                                                                     2 = 6
                                                                     2 = 6
                                                                      22

                                                                        = 3
    We see our endpoint is at  = 3. To determine if we use an open or closed circle at the endpoint, we
    substitute  = 3 into our original inequality.

                                                             2 + 5  11
                                                           2(3) + 5  11

                                                               6 + 5  11
                                                               11  11 

    Since 11  11 is a true statement, we will shade the endpoint. At this point our graph looks like this.

                                                    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

2) Check to see if we shade to the left. As before, pick any point to the left of our endpoint. Let's use  = 0.
    Substitute  = 0 into the original inequality.
                                                              2 + 5  11
                                                            2(0) + 5  11
                                                                0 + 5  11
                                                                  5  11 
    Since 5  11 is a true statement, we must shade to the left. At this point, our graph looks like this.

                                                       -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

3) Finally, check to see if we shade to the right. Pick any pint to the right of our endpoint. Let's use  = 4.
    Substitute  = 4 into the original inequality.
                                                              2 + 5  11
                                                            2(4) + 5  11
                                                                8 + 5  11
                                                                13  11 
    Since 13  11 is not a true statement, we do not shade to the right.

4) Our final solution is shown below.

                                                       -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

                                                       This is the graph of   3.

GPS 9: Solving Linear Inequalities, Part 2

In the previous section we learned to solve inequalities by first replacing the inequality with an equals symbol.
While this has some advantages (most notably, this method works even with many more complicated equations
you may learn in later mathematics), it is sometimes desirable to solve inequalities without switching out for an
equals symbol. We can do this by making note of the following.

           Multiplying or Dividing by Negative Numbers Reverses the Inequality                  IN

           When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, you must reverse the

           direction of the inequality.

           For example:

           1 < 5 but after multiplying both sides by -2 we get -2 > -10.

Problem 9.1

Solve the inequality.

                                                            -3 + 1 > 13
Unlike in the last section, we will solve this inequality without first replacing the > with an equals sign.

           -3 + 1 > 13                            The first step is to subtract 1 from both sides.

           -3 + 1 -  > 13 -                       Addition and subtraction keeps the same inequality.

                       -3 > 12                    Our next step is to divide both sides by -3.
                       -3 < 12                    We must also reverse the order of the inequality,
                       - -                        because are dividing by a negative number.

                           < -4

The solution to the inequality is  < -4. We have graphed the solution below.

                                    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

You should still pick points and test that you have found the correct solution.

GPS 10: Solving Linear Equations with Fractions

Oh no! Not fractions. Yes. Fractions! In this section, we will learn how to make fractions go away.

Problem 10.1

Solve for .

                                               1 5 17
                                               3  + 6 = 6

While you can correctly solve this equation by performing the same sequence of steps you would if this problem
did not have any fractions, the fraction arithmetic involved would make you much more likely to make mistakes.

Our first goal is to eliminate all fractions. In order to eliminate the fractions, we look at the denominators of all
the fractions. In this case, the denominators are 3 and 6. We want to find a common multiple of 3 and 6. We see
a common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6.

Multiply both sides of the equation by a common multiple of the denominators: 6.

                                               15          17
                                            6 3  + 6 = 6  6 

We will distribute the 6 on the left.

                                            1      5       17
                                       6 3  + 6 6 = 6  6 

Before multiplying the numbers, take a moment to recall our first goal is to eliminate the fractions. If you have

correctly found a common multiple, you should be able to divide the common multiple by each denominator to

get a whole number.

                                       6              6
                                       3=2            6=1

                                               1      5                     17
                                               6 3  + 6 6 = 6  6 

This will simplify our equation by eliminating all fractions.
                                                       2(1) + 1(5) = 1(17)
                                                               2 + 5 = 17

This new equation is easier to solve.
                                                             2 + 5 = 17

                                                        2 + 5 -  = 17 - 
                                                                  2 = 12
                                                                  2 = 12
                                                                    
                                                                     = 6

62                     GPS 10: Solving Linear Equations with Fractions

We will guide you through your first problem with fractions, and then you can work an additional problem
alone.

   Problem 10.2                                   1 91
                                                  2  = 14  + 7
Solve for .

Our first goal is to eliminate the denominators.

1) List the three denominators of fractions. _______, _______, and _______.

2) Find a common multiple of the denominators. Note that a common multiple cannot be smaller than the

    largest number. There are many ways to find a common multiple. You can always just multiply the

    denominators together to find a common multiple, but that's only a good idea if you are really stuck.

    A common multiple of the denominators is _______.

3) Multiply both sides of the equation by the common multiple. Fill in the box below with the common

    multiple. Note that we drew the parentheses around each side for you--you will need to draw your own in

    the next problem.

                        1                                91
                       2  =                            14  + 7

4) You must distribute the common multiple to every term on the right side of the equation.

                       1                               9        1
                       2  = 14  + 7

5) Simplify each term by dividing the term in the box by the denominator of the fraction. The new equation

    should not have any fractions. Solve the new equation without fractions below.

GPS 12: Solving Literal Linear Equations

Sometimes equations have more than one variable. We will see soon that this is very common when working
with lines, for example. While there are some important differences between an equation with one variable and
an equation with more than one variable, you could still imagine these equations as a balance. Here's an
example.

                                                        3 + 1 = 2 +  + 5

                                                              
                               
                                                       !!!! !!!!

                                            =

The operations we used to solve equations until this point still work the same way.

Problem 12.1

Solve for .

                                            3 + 1 = 2 +  + 5

We follow the same strategies as before.

First goal: Get all the terms involving the variable we are solving for on one side of the equation, and every term

without the variable on the opposite side.

             3 + 1 = 2 +  + 5               This is our starting equation.

             3 -  + 1 = 2 +  -  + 5 Subtract  from each side.

             2 + 1 = 2 + 5                  Simplify.

             2 + 1 -  = 2 + 5 -             Subtract 1 from both sides the equation.

             2 = 2 + 4                      Simplify.

We have accomplished our first goal. All the 's are on the left and there are no 's on the right.

Second Goal: Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable we are solving.

              2 = 2 + 4                     Divide both sides by 2.

                            

                          = 2 + 4           Since there is a fraction on the right side, we can actually
                                  2         simplify this equation a bit more by breaking the fraction
                                            into two (since the denominators are the same) and
                          = 2 + 4           reducing the fractions. You may not always have to do
                                22          this step depending on the problem. Sometimes you'll
                                            want to leave the answer as one big fraction.
                           =  + 2
Our final answer:  =  + 2.

Occasionally the problems will require us to divide by the variables and not just numbers.

                                               = 2 

We first note that there are fractions in this equation. As we learned in previous sections, our first step is to
eliminate denominators by multiplying both sides by 2.

                                                                       1

                                                            2 = 

To solve for , we must divide by the coefficient of . The coefficient in this case is the variable .

                                              2 =

That's it. We have successfully solved for .

The Coordinate Plane and Lines

GPS 13: Introduction to the Coordinate Plane

In this section we will begin our study of graphing. We will recall how to graph points, and then begin a study of
graphing lines.

Important Parts of the Coordinate Plane                  The Coordinate Plane
1. There are two axes.
                                                                           
         a. The -axis is horizontal. The left side has
              negative values. The right side has                               -axis
              positive values.
                                                         Origin                  
         b. The -axis is vertical. The bottom has
              negative values. The top has positive              -axis
              values.

2. The Origin is the point where the two axes
    intersect. The coordinates of the origin are (0,0).

Plotting Points

A point has two coordinates. We write the coordinates in parentheses with a comma between them. Sometimes
the coordinates are called an ordered pair.

                                      (, )

                    The -coordinate                                          The -coordinate
1) The -coordinate is always written first.              1) The -coordinate is always written second.
2) Indicates distance right or left from the -axis.      2) Indicates distance above or below the -axis.
3) Sign indicates which side of the -axis.               3) Sign indicates which side of the -axis.

         a) Positive values are to the right of the               a) Positive values are above the -axis.
              -axis.                                              b) Negative values are below the -axis.

         b) Negative values are to the left of the
              -axis.

              a) If the  is positive, count (but do not                       -3

              b) If the  is negative count (but do not

Drawing Lines from Given Points

After learning to plot points, the next shape we will draw is a line.

Problem 13.3

Plot the two points (-2,3) and (1,2). Then draw the line containing the points.

1) Plot the first point.                                               (-2,3)

4) Make sure to note that the line does not start
    and stop at the two points. The line goes                                       1
    through the two points, and keeps going in
    both directions.                                  -3 -2 -1 0

Drawing Lines from Given Equation

In the last few problems, we started with points and graphed a line containing them. In the next few problems,
we will begin an exploration of graphing lines by starting with an equation for the line. You observed that given
any two different points, you can draw one line containing them.

Problem 13.9

Fill in the missing coordinates for the line whose equation is given. Then graph the line.
                                          Equation Points with missing coordinates

                                                     ??? -2

Our first goal is to find the missing coordinates. For this we use a very important idea. When working with

equations with two variables and only one known value, substitute the value you know and then solve the for

one you don't.

GPS 14: Intercepts of a Line

Throughout this section, we will learn more about lines by examining their equations and their graphs. You can
always graph a line by first plotting any two points on the line, and then draw the line that passes through the
two points. There are two special points that are often helpful to plot.

The Intercepts                                                                                  PB

1. The -intercept is the point on the line intersecting the -axis.

2. The -intercept is the point on the line intersecting the -axis.

    1) The _____-coordinate of the -intercept is always 0.

Based on these observations, we always know one coordinate of each intercept. Finding the other coordinate is
just like in the previous section.

Problem 14.2

Find the -intercept of the line whose equation is given.
                                                            6 + 5 = 30

The -intercept is the point on the line intersecting the -axis. On the -axis, the -coordinate of every point is
0. We can use this observation to find the -coordinate of the -intercept.

    1) Substitute  = 0 into the equation of the line.
                                                                  6 + 5 = 30

                                                                         5 = 30

    2) Solve for .

                                                                     5 = 30
                                                                     55

    3) The -intercept is the point (0,6).


                   The -intercept (and -intercept) is a point. This means you must specify the - IN
                   and -coordinate! Many students often say the -intercept is 6 instead of (0,6),
                   and this is a very bad habit.

   Problem 14.3

Find the -intercept of the line whose equation is given.
                                                            2 - 3 = 12

GPS 15: Slope and Equations of a Line

If you imagine a line is a road you are walking on, you would notice that some lines are steeper than others. The
word we use to describe the steepness of a line is slope.

There are a variety of ways to express the formula to calculate the slope of a line. We start with this one.

                 Definition of the Slope of a Line                                              PB

                 The slope of the (nonvertical) line passing through the two points (1, 1) and

                 (2, 2) is                           = 2 - 1
                                                          2 - 1

                 It is tradition to use the letter  to designate the slope.

                 The subscript 1 and 2 on the  and  are just a way of telling the 1st and 2nd
                 points apart since they both have an - and -coordinate.

Problem 15.1

Find the slope of the line passing through the points (-3, -4) and (1,4). Then graph the line.

1 = -3           1 = -4     By substituting into the formula, we calculate.
2 = 1            2 = 4                              = 4 - (-4) = 8 = 2
                                                          1 - (-3) 4

The slope is 2.                                                              

To graph this line, we plot the two points and draw
the line containing them as in the previous sections.

                                                                                                


                   The subtraction often confuses students who forget that subtracting a negative is AA
                   the same as adding the opposite (a positive!).

The slope is_______.

                                                                                                                                                 



Memorizing the previous formula is often very confusing since the formula has lots of weird subscripts. A better
way to remember the formula is by thinking of it differently.

    Slope Formula Again                                                                                                                      PB

    The slope of the (nonvertical) line passing through any two points is

                       =  = change in  = subtract  - coordinates
                             change in  subtract  - coordinates

    Be careful with the order of subtraction and do not change it between the - and IN
    -coordinates. Whatever point's -coordinate you put first in the numerator,
    you must also put that point's -coordinate first in the denominator.

Find the slope of the line passing through the points (-2,6) and (4, -3).

We still don't know an equation for our lines. We will learn one of the most common ways to find an equation
for a line.

The Slope-Intercept Equation of a Line                                                              PB

If you know the slope  of a line and the -intercept (0, ), then the slope-

intercept equation of the line is

                                     =  + 

Problem 16.3

Find the equation of the line passing through the points (-4,2) and (1, -8). Write the equation in slope-
intercept form.

Our goal is to write the equation in the form  =  + . For this, we must determine the values of  and .

1) We know to use the slope formula to find .

 = -8 - 2 = -10 = -2
      1 - (-4) 5

2) To find , we substitute the value of  and the values of one of our points into the equation
     =  + . We can use either of the two points we want. Let's use the first point (-4,2).

      =  +                          We substituted  = -2,  = -4 and  = 2.
     2 = -2(-4) +                   Simplify the arithmetic.
     2 = 8 +                        Subtract 8 from both sides.
2 -  = 8 -  +                       We now know the value of .
   -6 = 

3) We know  = -2 and  = -6. We can write the equation as

                                                = -2 - 6

If we chose the second point (1, -8) in step 2), we would get the same value for  in the equation.

                         =  +       We substituted  = -2,  = 1 and  = -8.
                     -8 = -2(1) +   Simplify the arithmetic.
                     -8 = -2 +      Add 2 to both sides.
                -8 +  = -2 +  +     We now know the value of .
                     -6 = 

We can write the equation as

                                                              = -2 - 6

In the last section, we were introduced to the slope-intercept equation.

The Slope-Intercept Equation of a Line                                                          PB

If you know the slope  of a line and the -intercept (0, ), then the slope-

intercept equation of the line is

                                    =  + 

Soon we will see that this equation makes graphing lines incredibly easy. We will first practice working with this
equation.

                                                     = 3 - 5

This equation is already written in slope-intercept form. As a result, we can easily read off the information.
The slope is the coefficient of the , which is 3.
The -coordinate of the -intercept is -5 which means the -intercept is the point (0, -5).

The slope is  = 3.                                  The -intercept is (0, -5).

Problem 17.6

Find the slope and -intercept for the graph of the equation.

                                   5 - 10 = 30

This equation is not in slope-intercept form, but we can first convert it to the slope-intercept form by solving
this equation for .

                      5 - 10 = 30

                      5 -  - 10 = - + 30 subtract 5 from both sides

                      -10 = -5 + 30

                      -10 = -5 + 30                 divide every term by - 10

                            = 2  - 3

This equation is now in slope-intercept form, and we can easily read off the slope and -intercept.

GPS 18: Graphing Lines in Slope-Intercept Form

To see why it is so easy to graph a line in slope-intercept form, we first revisit an earlier formulation of the slope.

Slope Formula                                                                                   PB

The slope of the (nonvertical) line passing through any two points is

                = subtract  - coordinates
                     subtract  - coordinates

When we subtract the -coordinates, geometrically we are calculating the distance between their values on the
-axis. This tells us how far up or down the -axis we have moved. Similarly, when we subtract the -
coordinates, geometrically we are calculating the distance between their values on the -axis. This leads to the
final interpretation of the slope.

Slope Formula Geometrically                                                                     PB

The slope of the (nonvertical) line passing through any two points is

 = subtract  - coordinates = rise = distance up/down
      subtract  - coordinates run distance right/left

Graph the line.                                                              Up 2    Right 3

    1) Identify the slope and -intercept.                                                          point
              a. The slope is  = 2.

                                                         3

              b. The -intercept is (0,1).
    2) Plot the -intercept.
    3) Use the slope to plot a 2nd point.

              a. If the numerator (top) of the slope is
                   positive, go up that many units. If it is
                   negative, go down that many units.

              b. If the denominator (bottom) of the
                   slope is positive, go right that many
                   units. If it is negative, go left that
                   many units.

Our slope tells us
                              2 up 2

                        = 3 = right 3

    4) Draw the line passing through the two points.

Even though plotting two points is good enough to graph the line, it is often helpful to plot more points. To do
this, we can simply repeat the moving up/down and moving right/left as directed by the slope.

It is easy to see how to use this technique to plot a 3rd                           
point. But if we examine this line closely, we can spot
4th and 5th points on the line. It turns out that we can                            3rd
also find these two points by remembering a fact from                              point

The slope can be written as                                              Point
                                    2
                                                                                                         
                              = 3
But since a negative divided by a negative is positive,                                    2nd
we can also write the slope as                                                            point

The slope is  = - 3.
                                                         Start

We start by plotting (0,4)                                                  Right 2

Using the slope, we find our directions                                                          2nd

We can also write the negative in the denominator to

get
                         3 3 up 3

                      - 2 = -2 = left 2

Doing this repeatedly, we can plot more than 2 points

quite easily.

GPS 19: Finding an Equation of a Line from its graph

Instead of graphing a line from the equation, we will find an equation of the line from its graph by using the
slope and the -intercept.

Problem 19.1                                                             

Find an equation of the line.                                             Right 2

To find an equation, we need to find the slope                     Up 3                                        
and the -intercept.                                    -intercept
                                                                                                 2nd
We first find the -intercept by locating the
point where the line cuts the -axis.                                                            point

We see that this point is (0,1), and so  = .

Now, we locate another point on the line, and
find the slope by counting how many units we
need to travel up/down and right/left to reach
the next point.

Starting at the -intercept, we must go up 3.
Therefore, the rise is +.
From there, we must go right 2. Therefore, the

run is +.
Combing this, our slope  =  = + = .

                                                   + 

Finally, we can write the equation in
 =  +  form.

We have been calculating the slope by using two points on the line. While graphing this line in Problem 20.1, we
observed there were many additional points on the line we could easily spot. Let's pick one additional point and
use the point (2,3) from the problem to calculate the slope.

Using the points (2,3) and (5,3), we calculate.

Find the slope of the horizontal line passing through the point (1,4).



The slopes of both lines are zero because the numerators of both fractions are zero. Recall that the numerator
of the slope is the difference in the -coordinates. On a horizontal line, we saw that the -coorindates are
always the same--this means their difference will always be zero.

The slopes of both lines are not defined because the denominators of both fractions are zero. Recall that the

coorindates are always the same--this means their difference will always be zero.

The slope of any vertical line is not defined (undefined). You may also say a

vertical line has no slope.

Many students confuse vertical lines having an undefined slope or (no slope) with IN
having zero slope. The difference between zero and undefined can be a little
tricky. Saying there is no slope means that the slope does not exist; it is not even
a number. Zero is a number, and it does exist.

Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations

   Problem 21.1

Consider the linear equation below.

                                             2 + 5 = 9

Solve the equation.                          Check your solution is correct by substituting back into
                                             the original equation.



Usually we present a worked problem before asking you to solve one on your own. But this problem is a review
of a previous topic, and so you should know how to do it on your own. Just in case you need a refresher, we
work a similar problem next.

Problem 21.2

Consider the linear equation below.

                                             3 - 7 = 5

Solve the equation.                          Check your solution is correct by substituting back into
                                             the original equation.
  3 - 7 = 5
                                                                     3 - 7 = 5
  3 - 7 +  = 5 +  add 7 to both sides                               3(4) - 7=? 5

  3 = 12                                                              12 - 7=? 5
                                                                           5=5 
  3 = 12             divide both sides by 3
   
    = 4



In both of the previous problems, we only had one linear equation with one variable. We are now going to
extend these ideas to a system of linear equations. In a system of linear equations, we have more than one
linear equation with more than one variable. We will see our first system of linear equations in the next
problem.

124  GPS 21: Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations and Solving Graphically

In the next problem, there are two linear equations. There are two variables. The graph of each equation is a
line. This is an example of a system of linear equations. Before we learn how to solve the system, we will
start by learning how to check if a point is a solution to the system.

Problem 21.3

Is the point (5,6) a solution to the system of equations?

                                              2 - 2 = -2
                                              7 - 2 = 5

To answer this question, we must substitute the values  = 5 and  = 6 into both equations.

Substitute (5,6) into the first equation.                  Substitute (5,6) into the second equation.
                        2 - 2 = -2                                                  7 -  = 5

                   2(5) - 2(6)=? - 2                                              7(5) - 6=? 5
                                                                                     35 - 6=? 5
                        10 - 12=? - 2                                                    29=/ 5 
                            -2 = -2 

We see that the point (5,6) satisfies the first equation. However, it did not satisfy the second equation. Since it
does not satisfy both equations, (5,6) is not a solution to the system of equations.


   Problem 21.4

Is the point (-2, -1) a solution to the system of equations?

                                              -3 +  = 5
                                                6 +  = -4

Substitute (-2, -1) into the first equation.               Substitute (-2, -1) into the second equation.

Is the point (-2, -1) a solution to the system? Why or why not?

   Problem 21.5

Is the point (-1,2) a solution to the system of equations?

                                            -3 +  = 5
                                              6 +  = -4

Substitute (-1,2) into the first equation.  Substitute (-1,2) into the second equation.

Is the point (-1,2) a solution to the system? Why or why not?


The main idea of this section is summarized in the box below.

Solution to a System of Equations                                                               PB

A point that when substituted into all equations in a system of equations results

in all true statements is a solution to the system of equations.

We often say that the point must satisfy all equations rather than the much
longer sentence above.

126              GPS 21: Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations and Solving Graphically

Solving Systems of Linear Equations Graphically

We will learn the first method for finding the solution to a system of linear equations. We spent a great deal of
time learning to graph lines in previous sections, and we will now use graphing as a tool to help us find a
solution. We return to the system of equations first introduced in Problem 21.3.

Problem 21.6

Find the solution to the system of equations by graphing both lines and finding their point of intersection. Check
your solution algebraically.

                                            2 - 2 = -2
                                            7 - 2 = 5

In our work on lines, we recognized that the graph of each equation is a line. We will graph both lines on the
same coordinate plane.

     1) Put each equation into slope-intercept form ( =  + ) to make graphing easier.

                        2 - 2 = -2                       7 -  = 5

                 2 -  - 2 = - - 2                        7 -  -  = - + 5

                        -2 = -2 - 2                      - = -7 + 5

                        -2 = -2 - 2                      - = -7 + 5
                        - - -                            - - -

                            =  + 1                          = 7 - 5

     2) Graph both lines on the same coordinate                      

        plane.

     3) Find the point where the two lines intersect.

        Our two lines intersect at the point (1,2).

     4) Check the solution by substituting it back into

        both original equations.                         2 - 2 = -2

Check:                                                                                          Point of
                                                                                              Intersection
Substitute (1,2) into the Substitute (1,2) into the
                                                                                                                    
first equation.         second equation.

     2 - 2 = -2                   7 -  = 5

2(1) - 2(2)=? - 2       7(1) - 2=? 5

        2 - 4=? - 2               7 - 2=? 5
          -2 = -2                     5=5 

                                                                                              7 -  = 5

The solution is (1,2).


Geometrically, finding the point of intersection of both lines (a common point on both lines) is the same as
finding  and  values so that when we algebraically substitute into both equations, they are both true.

              -2 = -3 - 8                                                   -4 = -6 + 8
              - - -                                                         - - -

We notice something different in this picture. There is no                                  
point where the lines intersect. We may worry that we
made a mistake graphing our lines. Maybe our picture is too  3 - 2 = -8
small, and they lines intersect far away?

Let's take a closer look. Notice the slope of each line is 3.

                                                                                             2

Both lines have the same slope. This means the lines are
parallel, and parallel lines never intersect. 

This system of equation has no solution.

                                                                                                6 - 4 = 8



              If two different lines have the same slope, then they are parallel and never      PB

              intersect. The system of linear equations has no solution. A system of linear

              equations with no solution is sometimes called inconsistent.

We notice something different in this picture. We                                         
thought we were graphing two different lines, but it turns
out that there is really only one line! Since a solution to a  3 -  = -2
system is a point on both lines and there is only one line,
every point on the line is a solution to the system.

This system of equation has infinitely many solutions.                                                                        

Look at the slope and -interecept of each line. Notice                                      -6 + 2 = 4
that they have the same slope and the same -intercept.
When our lines were parallel in Problem 22.1, they also
had the same slope, but their -intercepts were different.

GPS 23: Solving Systems of Linear Equations Algebraically

In the previous section, we learned to find a solution to a system of equations by graphing both lines on the
same coordinate plane and looking for a point of intersection. While this method was visually nice, there are
times when drawing a picture is just not realistic. In these cases, we must use an alternate method of solving a
system. The method we are going to learn is often called the addition method. Sometimes this method is also
referred to as the elimination method.

One difficulty with a system of equations is that there are too many variables and too many equations. We will
see how we can use a technique to reduce our two equations with two variables to only one equation with only
one variable.

We introduce you to the addition method by way of the next problem. You will see soon why it is called the
addition method.

Problem 23.1

Use the addition method to solve the system of equations.

                                        4 + 5 = 24 (. )
                                        6 + 7 = 34 (. )

Goal 1: Eliminate one variable, then solve for the remaining variable.

We will accomplish our goal of eliminating one variable by multiplying each equation by a (nonzero) integer so

that the coefficients of the 's are opposites. In Eq. 1 the coefficient of  is 4. In Eq. 2, the coefficient of  is 6.

The (least) common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12. If we multiply 4 by -3, the result will be -12. If we multiply 6 by

2, the result will be 12. Let's proceed to see how this helps.

We start by multiplying every term in Eq. 1 by -3.

                                        4 + 5 = 24                      (. )

                                  (-)(4) + (-)(5) = (-)(24)

                                        -12 - 15 = -72                  (. )

This gives us a new version of Eq. 1 which we have labeled Eq. 3. Notice that the coefficient of  is now -12. We

now multiply every term in Eq. 2 by 2.

                                        6 + 7 = 34                      (. )

                                  ()(6) + ()(7) = ()(34)

                                        12 + 14 = 68                    (. )

This gives us a new version of Eq. 2 which we have labeled Eq. 4. Notice that the coefficient of  is now 12. We
will now add Eq. 3. and Eq. 4.

                                           -12 - 15 = -72       (. )
                                        + - 12 + 14 = 68        (. )

                                                       - = -4   (. )
                                                          = 4

Notice that Eq. 5 (which we attained by adding Eq. 3 and Eq. 4) has only one variable and we were able to easily

solve it to determine  = 4.

Goal 2: Find the other variable.

Now that we know the value of , we substitute  = 4 into either of our first two original equations. We will

demonstrate how you can substitute into either equation, but ordinarily you only need to do one or the other.

Substitute  = 4 into Eq. 1                          Substitute  = 4 into Eq. 2

       4 + 5 = 24 (. )                                                  6 + 7 = 34 (. )

       4 + 5(4) = 24                                                    6 + 7(4) = 34

       4 + 20 = 24 (. )                                                 6 + 28 = 34 (. )

                      4 = 4                                                   6 = 6

                       = 1                                                     = 1

Once we substituted  = 4 into Eq. 1, the new Eq. 6. had only , and it was easy to solve to see that  = 1.

Similarly, we were able to substitute  = 4 into Eq. 2 and get Eq 7 with only , and it was easy to solve to see

 = 1.

At this point, we hope we have reached our solution  = 1,  = 4 which we write as an ordered pair (1,4). But
before moving on, we will check that we have the correct solution by substituting (1,4) into both original
equations.
Goal 3: Check the answer is correct!

Check:                                           Substitute (1,4) into Eq. 2.
                                                                         6 + 7 = 34
Substitute (1,4) into Eq. 1.
                        4 + 5 = 24                                   6(1) + 7(4)=? 34

                                                                              34 = 34 
                          4 + 20=? 24
                             24 = 24 

Our solution is correct. The solution is (1,4).


Always check your solution in both original equations!                                          IN

Solving a system of equations requires more steps than any other topic we will

learn about all semester. This means there are even more opportunities to make

mistakes. But by checking your answer every time, you can learn to avoid costly

mistakes.

Before asking you to do one completely on your own, we will guide you through the procedure.

146                   GPS 23: Solving Systems of Linear Equations Algebraically

   Problem 23.2

Use the addition method to solve the system of equations.

                                                      3 + 7 = 26 (. )
                                                      5 + 4 = 281 (. )

We will guide you through solving your first system of equations algebraically.

Goal 1: Eliminate one variable, then solve for the remaining variable.
    1) You must pick one of the variables  or  to focus on. Let's pick  so that we can work together.
    2) You must determine the coefficient of  in each equation. Fill in the blanks below.
              a. The coefficient of  in Eq. 1 is ______.
              b. The coefficient of  in Eq. 2 is ______.
    3) Find the (least) common multiple of the coefficients from the previous step. Recall that finding the
         (least) common multiple was used when finding a common denominator to add fractions. We also found
         this when we cleared denominators in previous sections. If you can't easily find the least common
         multiple, you can always just multiply the two numbers together and use this multiple.

                   The (least) common multiple is ______. The opposite value is ______.

     4) We must now determine by what you will multiply each of the coefficients from Step 2 so that the
         product is the common multiple, or its opposite, from Step 3. Additionally, you must ensure that one of
         the products is positive and one is negative.
              a. The coefficient of  in Eq. 1 is ______ (same blank from Step 2a). If I multiply it by ______, the

                   result will be ______ (same blank from Step 3, or the opposite).

              b. The coefficient of  in Eq. 2 is ______ (same blank from Step 2b). If I multiply it by ______, the

                   result will be ______ (same blank from Step 3, or the opposite).

     Before moving on, check again. Did you make sure you chose numbers to       IN

     multiply by so that the results are opposites?

     5) Multiply every term of each equation by the numbers you determined in Step 4. We put parentheses in
         to help you. All 3 parentheses in each row must be the same number.

                                         ( )(3) + ( )(7) = ( )(26) (. )

                                         ( )(5) + ( )(4) = ( )(28)1 (. )

         Simplify each of the equations to get two new equations. Write them below being careful to line up the
         variables.

6) Add the two equations together. If you successfully made sure the coefficients of  were opposites, then
     should now be eliminated!

7) Solve the equation from Step 6 to determine the  value.

 =_______

Goal 2: Find the other variable.

8) Substitute the  value from Step 7 into either of the original equations. So you can see it doesn't matter

which you choose, there is space below for you to substitute into both equations. Usually you only do

one or the other, however.

Substitute  =_______ into Eq. 1. Fill in the         Substitute  =_______ into Eq. 2. Fill in the 
value in the parentheses to get started. Then solve  value in the parentheses to get started. Then solve
the equation for .                                   the equation for .

                       3 + 7 = 26                                         5 + 4 = 281

           3 + 7( ) = 26                                           5 + 4( ) = 28

 =_______                                             =_______

You should have found the same  value no matter which equation you chose.

Goal 3: Check the answer is correct!

9) We must now check our solution by substituting both  and  into both original equations.

We think our solution is  =_______ and  =_______.

Substitute both values into Eq. 1.                   Substitute both values into Eq. 2.

           3 + 7 = 26                                              5 + 4 = 281

           3( ) + 7( )=? 26                                        5( ) + 4( )=? 28

Write the solution as an ordered pair. The solution is __________.

148                   GPS 23: Solving Systems of Linear Equations Algebraically

If both equations didn't check in Step 9, then you made a mistake, and you must correct it. The first place to look
for a mistake is in your arithmetic in Step 9. Make sure you substituted and calculated correctly! If you didn't
make a mistake in Step 9, then take a look at previous steps. Step 4 is another common place students make
mistakes, and we have issued a warning during that step to help you avoid it. Sometimes if you can't find the
mistake in a reasonable time, it is best to turn to a new page and start again. Don't erase your incorrect solution
because you can often find your mistake later after you work it correctly or after getting help from someone. It
is always helpful to determine where the mistake was so you can avoid doing it again.

We summarize the procedure we just followed here.

The Addition Method for Solving a System of Linear Equations
Goal 1: Eliminate one variable, then solve for the remaining variable.

    1) Pick one of the variables you would like to eliminate. You may use whichever variable you would like.
         Sometimes one variable is easier than the other.

    2) Determine the coefficients of the variable you picked.
    3) Find the (least) common multiple of the coefficients.
    4) Determine what you must multiply each coefficient by in order to ensure the products are opposites.

         This means the products must have opposite signs after you multiply--there should be one negative and
         one positive coefficient!
    5) Multiply each term of the equations by the numbers you determined in the previous step. After
         simplifying the coefficients of the variable you picked, the new coefficients should be opposites.
    6) Add the new equations together. If you successfully made sure the coefficients of your variable were
         opposites, then that variable should now be eliminated! There should only be one variable remaining.
    7) Solve the new equation for the remaining variable.
Goal 2: Find the other variable.
    8) Substitute the value you found in the previous step into either of the original equations. Solve this
         equation for the remaining variable.
Goal 3: Check the answer is correct!
    9) Check your solution by substituting into both original equations.

Problem 24.1

Use the addition method to solve the system of equations.

                                          2 + 3 = 11 (. )

                                          4 + 6 = 22 (. )

We start by multiplying every term in Eq. 1 by -2.

                                          2 + 3 = 11                    (. )

                          (-)(2) + (-)(3) = (-)(11)

                                          -4 - 6 = -22                  (. )

This gives us a new version of Eq. 1 which we have labeled Eq. 3. We don't have to multiply Eq. 2 by anything (or

you can say we multiplied by 1 which changes nothing).

We will now add Eq. 3. and Eq. 2.

                                      -4 - 6 = -22         (. )
                                   + - 4 + 6 = 22          (. )

                                                    0=0

Solution: We have with a true statement 0 = 0. This means there are infinitely many solutions, and the system

is said to be dependent.

Explanation: Something different happened here. Both variables were eliminated! The good news is 0 = 0 is a

true statement. Let's see what happens if we try the graphical method of solving this system. We start by

putting each equation into slope-intercept form ( =  + ).

              2 + 3 = 11                                                4 + 6 = 22

2 -  + 3 = - + 11                                                       4 -  + 6 = - + 22

                          3 = -2 + 11                                         6 = -4 + 22

                          3 = -2 + 11                                         6 = -4 + 22
                                                                                

                                    2 11                                                2 11
                            = - 3  + 3                                          = - 3  + 3

We see that both lines have the same slope and the same -intercept. We have seen this before. Recall this

meant we actually have only one line instead of two. In this case, we said there are infinitely many solutions.

Problem 24.3

Use the addition method to solve the system of equations.

                                  4 + 6 = 22 (. )

                                  2 + 3 = 5 (. )

We start by multiplying every term in Eq. 2 by -2.

                                  2 + 3 = 5                 (. )

                                  (-)(2) + (-)(3) = (-)(5)

                                  -4 - 6 = -10              (. )

This gives us a new version of Eq. 2 which we have labeled Eq. 3. We don't have to multiply Eq. 1 by anything.

We will now add Eq. 1. to Eq. 3.

                                  4 + 6 = -22 (. )

                                  + - 4 - 6 = -10 (. )

                                                    0=/ 12

Solution: We have with a false statement 0 = 12. This means there are no solutions, and the system is said to

be inconsistent.

Explanation: Something different happened here. Again, both variables were eliminated! The bad news is we

are left with a false statement since 0 does not equal 12. Let's try the graphical method of solving this system.

We start by putting each equation into slope-intercept form ( =  + ).

                  4 + 6 = 22                                           2 + 3 = 5

     4 -  + 6 = - + 22                                      2 -  + 3 = - + 5

                  6 = -4 + 22                                                    3 = -2 + 5

                  6 = -4 + 22                                                    3 = -2 + 5
                                                                                   

                            2 11                                                           25
                    = - 3  + 3                                                     = - 3  + 3

We see that both lines have the same slope but they have different -intercepts. Recall, this means we have two

parallel lines that never intersect. In this case, there is no solution, and the system is said to be inconsistent.


   Problem 24.4

Use the addition method to solve the system of equations.
                                                          10 + 12 = -1
                                                          15 + 18 = 4

What does it mean when both variables are eliminated?                                           PB

In the last few problems we saw an unusual occurrence when both variables

were eliminated after adding the equations. We highlight what this meant.

1) When we are left with a true statement, usually  = :

This means the two lines are actually the same line. The system has

infinitely many solutions, and we say the system is dependent.

2) When we are left with a false statement, such as  = :

This means the two lines are parallel and never intersect. The system

has no solution, and we say the system is inconsistent.

                 the base.                                        is 3.

                                 We read this as,
                          " raised to the 3rd power."
                 For exponent 2, people often say squared.
                  For exponent 3, people often say cubed.

The Quotient Rule

We can use the principles we applied to reducing fractions to work with exponents.

     When reducing fractions, recall that we are actually creating 1's in place of our AA

     canceled factors since dividing a (nonzero) number by itself is 1.

     Example:

                                            11

                                      12 = 2  2  3 = 2/  2 3/
                                      18 2  3  3 2/ 3/ 3

                                            11

Problem 25.10

Simplify.

                                                                   5
                                                                   3

By writing out the meaning of the exponents, we see that we have factors that are in the numerator and the
denominator of our fraction. We recall from reducing fractions that these factors cancel and equal 1.

                                   5 =          = 2 = 2
                                   3            1

In simplified form, 3 5 = 2.


When there are coefficients, you simply reduce them as you would any other fraction.

In the next problem, there are more factors in the denominator than the numerator.

By again, writing out the meaning of the exponents, we see that we have factors that are in the numerator and
the denominator of our fraction. We recall from reducing fractions that these factors cancel and equal 1.

                                 2             1
                                 5 =          = 3

In simplified form, 5 2 = 3 1 .


When there is more than one variable, there can also be variables left in the numerator and denominator of our
fractions.

  To divide two expressions with the same base, keep the same base and subtract

  the exponents.

            = - if  >  and   = - 1 if  < 

  Note: We are not allowed to divide by 0. As a result, anytime we write an
  expression with a variable in the denominator, we will assume it is not zero or
  else our expression wouldn't make sense.

The Quotient Rule actually helps us understand a few special cases of exponents that often confuse students.

Zero Exponent Rule

In this next problem, everything cancels.

Problem 25.20

We already know the answer is 1, of course, since everything cancels. But we can apply the Quotient Rule to this
problem and observe the following.

                                                                2 = 0

But we recall when canceling fractions, we are actually creating 1's.
                                                              2 1
                                                              2 = 1 = 1

What we have just determined is that we should interpret 0 = 1.


  The Zero Exponent Rule                                                                        PB

  Every base (except 0) raised to the 0 power is 1.

                                          0 = 1   0
  00 is undefined since we can't divide by 0 as we did above.

GPS 26: Rules of Exponents, Part 2

Negative Exponent Rule

We know that when we subtract a bigger number from a smaller number, the result is negative. Let's see how
this works with exponents in the next problem.

Problem 26.1

Simplify.
                                                                   3
                                                                   5

We already know the answer, of course.

                                                                3 1
                                                                5 = 2
But instead of doing this, let's apply the Quotient Rule.
                                                          3 = 3-5 = -2
                                                          5
We have just determined how we should interpret the negative exponent.
                                                               -2 = 2 1


We can do a similar procedure to determine how we should interpret negative exponents in the denominator.

              The Negative Exponent Rule                                                        PB

              For every nonzero base,

              - = 1 and 1 - = 

Basically the Negative Exponent Rule indicates that a negative exponent means we can move the factor from the
numerator to the denominator (or from the denominator to the numerator) and change the exponent to its
opposite.

Problem 26.2

Simplify. Write expressions with only positive exponents.
                                                               -2-34

                                                                  3-5
Negative exponents can be eliminated by moving the factor and taking the opposite exponent. The positive

exponents don't move. Also, the exponents aren't on the coefficients so they remain where they are, even

though one coefficient is negative.

                                          -2-34 -245
                                            3-5 = 33

In the next few rules, there will be parentheses. Recall that we often use parentheses for grouping.

The parentheses tell us that we have 2 groups of 3 multiplied.

                                            3 's 3 's

                               (3)2 = (3) (3) = 6
                               .
                                      0

Since the last few problems involved having multiple groups, each having equal number of objects, it should not
surprise you to see multiplication.

The Product Raised to a Power Rule

Problem 26.12

Simplify.

                                    (52)3

The parentheses tell us that we have 3 groups of 52.

                  (52)3 = (52)(52)(52)                   by rearranging the order
                             = (5  5  5)(2  2  2)(    )
                             = 5363
                             = 12563

In simplified form, (52)3 = 12563.

The pattern is easy to spot. Every factor inside the parentheses gets raised to the power outside the
parentheses.

The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of any of its terms. This means the polynomial above has
degree 3. We also like to give names to polynomials based on how many terms are added together.

A monomial has only on term.

                                                2, 32, 63

A binomial has two terms.

                              2 - 4, 2 + 3, 3 + 1

A trinomial has three terms.                    2 + 3 + 5,         53 - 1252 + 5
                                    2 + 4 + 2,

If there are more than three terms, we just call it a polynomial.

Adding Polynomials

Adding polynomials is the same as combining like terms. This means we group the terms with the same variables
and exponents together and combine their coefficients.

Problem 27.1

Simplify completely.
                                              (22 - 3 + 6) + (-52 + 7 + 5)

We will simply rearrange the terms so that like terms are together and combine.
                     (22 - 3 + 6) + (-52 + 7 + 5) = (22 - 52) + (-3 + 7) + (6 + 5)
                                                                   = -32 + 4 + 11

In simplified form, (22 - 3 + 6) + (-52 + 7 + 5) = -32 + 4 + 11.

Subtracting Polynomials

One way to think about subtraction is by adding the opposite. We can use this same property we are
accustomed to using with numbers even when we are working with polynomials.

Subtraction                                                                                        AA

To subtract  from , add the opposite of  to .

                       -  =  + (-)

For example:

                      8 - 3 = 8 + (-3)

Problem 27.4

Simplify completely.

                                                (62 -  + 7) - (32 - 7 + 2)

We will change every coefficient in the second polynomial to its opposite and add.

                       (62 -  + 7) - (32 - 7 + 2) = (62 -  + 7) + (-32 + 7 - 2)
                                                                  = (62 - 32) + (- + 7) + (7 - 2)
                                                                  = 32 + 6 + 5

In simplified form, (62 -  + 7) - (32 - 7 + 2) = 32 + 6 + 5.

Dividing by a Monomial

When we learned to add fractions, we used an important fact that will help us divide a polynomial by a
monomial.

  Fraction Addition and Subtraction                                                             AA

                                            +  =  + 
                                               

  We can replace the addition with subtraction, and it is still true.

                                        -  =  - 
                                           

We are more accustomed to seeing these equalities with the left and right sides of this equation switched, but
the order makes no difference. We will also use this abbreviated version of the Quotient Rule from our Rules of
Exponents.

  The Quotient Rule                                                                             PB

  To divide two expressions with the same base, keep the same base and subtract

  the exponents.                        = -
                                       

Problem 27.10

Simplify completely.

                                                         126 - 63 + 42
                                                                   22

We use the property from fraction addition to break this into three smaller fractions and apply the quotient rule.

                                126 - 63 + 42 126 63 42
                                              = 22 - 22 + 22
                                   22

                                              = 64 - 3 + 2

                     126-63+42  4
In simplified form,             = 6 - 3 + 2.

GPS 28: Multiplying Polynomials

When working with polynomials, there is really only one method of multiplication you have to master, and we
have met this method before.

The Distributive Property                                                                       PB

                                     ( + ) =  + 

In addition to the distributive property, we will use the Product Rule for exponents.

The Product Rule                                                                                PB

To multiply two expressions with the same base, keep the same base and add

the exponents.

                                        = +

Problem 28.1

Multiply.
                                                         22(32 + 4 - 1)

We will distribute 22 to every term in the second polynomial and use our rules of exponents to simplify.

                               22(32 + 4 - 1) = (32) + (4) - (1)

                                                        = 64 + 83 - 22
In simplified form, 22(32 + 4 - 1) = 64 + 83 - 22.

Sometimes the term we need to distribute is on the right instead of the left. It doesn't matter since we can
multiple in any order we like.

Problem 28.4

Multiply.

                                    (33 - 52 + 7)(-3)

We do exactly as before. We distribute and use the rules of exponents.

              (33 - 52 + 7)(-3) = (33)- - (52)- + (7)-

                                    = -36 + 552 - 74

In all of the previous problems, one of the factors was a monomial. We are now going to learn to multiply any
two polynomials. We will use the exact same technique of distributing, but this time we will need to distribute
twice before we get to the final answer.

Problem 28.7

Multiply.

              (2 + 7)(32 + 4 + 5)

This problem will require us to distribute twice.

First, we will distribute the entire binomial (2 + 7) to each term in the second polynomial.

                   (2 + 7)(32 + 4 + 5)

                             (32)( + ) + (4)( + ) + (5)( + )
  Next, we distribute the term outside of each (2 + 7).

      (32)(2 + 7) + (4)(2 + 7) + (5)(2 + 7)

               (2) + (7) + ()(2) + ()(7) + ()(2) + ()(7)
  We use our rules of exponents to simply this expression.

                                 63 + 212 + 82 + 28 + 10 + 35
  Finally, we must combine the like terms to reach the final answer.

                                          63 + 292 + 38 + 35

We will guide you through the next problem to help you keep track of what to do at each step.

First, distribute the (3 + 4) as one big piece. We have provided parentheses for you to fill in.

  (22)(3 + 4) + (5)(3 + 4) + (6)(3 + 4)

Next, distribute the term outside each (3 + 4). This time, you will have to write your own parentheses.

Use your rules of exponents to simplify each term.

Finally, combine like terms to arrive at your final answer.

Before moving further, let's take a closer look at Problem 28.7.

                                                      (2 + 7)(32 + 4 + 5)
We want to compare the original problem to the expression with the arrow off to the right.

                           (32)(2) + (32)(7) + (4)(2) + (4)(7) + (5)(2) + (5)(7)
Notice that the term 2 is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial 32 + 4 + 5.

                           () + (32)(7) + ()() + (4)(7) + ()() + (5)(7)
Next, notice that the term 7 is also multiplied by every term in the second polynomial.

                           (32)(2) + () + (4)(2) + ()() + (5)(2) + ()()
In summary, we observe that you must multiply every term of the first polynomial by every term of the second
polynomial. You may have heard of a four letter word that many use for multiplying binomials. But like most
four letter words, its proper use is very limited, and students often get themselves into trouble using it
inappropriately.
The most difficult part of this process is keeping track of all the terms and their products. In the next problem,
we show a nice way to organize all the terms.

Problem 28.11

Multiply.

                                     (5 - 1)(22 - 3 + 6)

We start by making a table to arrange each polynomial. We put one term in each row and each column as
below. Pay careful attention to the negatives.

                                     22   -3                              6

                      5

                      -1

In each row, fill in the same term across every column. Put the term in parentheses since you will be multiplying.

                                     22   -3                              6

                      5              (5)(22) (5)(-3)                  (5)(6)

                      -1             (-1)(22) (-1)(-3) (-1)(6)

Next, in each column, fill in the same term down every row. Again, put them in parentheses.

                                     22   -3                              6

                      5              (5)() (5)(-)                     (5)()

                      -1             (-1)() (-1)(-) (-1)()

In each cell, use the rules of exponents to simplify each product.

                                     22   -3                              6
                                                                      30
                      5              103  -152                        -6

                      -1             -22  3

Finally, we must combine like terms. Like terms are often (but not always!) nicely arranged in diagonal
patterns.

                                     22   -3                              6

                      5              103  -152                        30

                      -1             -22  3                           -6

This brings us to our final answer.  103 - 172 + 33 - 6

In the next problem, we will start by drawing and labeling the table for you.

   Problem 28.12

Multiply.

                                                      (6 - 2)(32 - 7 + 5)
We drew and labeled the table for you. Fill in each cell with the proper terms. Use parentheses.

                                                  32  -7                       5

                  6

                  -2

Next, fill in the products from the table above.

                                                  32  -7                       5

                  6

                  -2

Finally, combine like terms to get the final answer.



In the next several problems, you must draw and label your own table.

     The diagonal terms are not always like terms. Sometimes diagonal terms        IN

     cannot be combined, and sometimes the terms you can combine aren't diagonal!

     Be careful and don't just start adding up diagonals without thinking.

There is one problem type of problem that often confuses students.

Problem 28.17

Multiply.

                                    (2 + 3)2

We must pay careful attention to our rules of exponents. Properly applying the rules of exponents gives us the

following.
                                                  (2 + 3)2 = (2 + 3)(2 + 3)

We must write the binomial twice, and then multiply as in the previous problems.

                                       2                               3

We simplify each product.

Finally, we combine like terms.     42 + 12 + 9

GPS 29: Removing the Greatest Common Factor

Factoring Polynomials
In the previous sections, we learned lots of ways to combine and simplify polynomials. In the next few sections,
we will learn some ways of taking them apart. In particular, we will learn how to factor polynomials.

Recall the meaning of the word factor as you have seen it before now.

              2  5 = 10        (32)(6) = 183               ( + 2)( + 3) = 2 + 5 + 6

              factors product  factors            product              factors  product

In the past you often started with two or more factors and multiplied them together to find the product.
Factoring is the opposite of multiplying in the sense that you start with the product, but then attempt to break
the product into two or more factors. We will see some reasons why we will do this soon enough. For now, think
of factoring as breaking a large product into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces will often be easier to work
with in our future applications rather than working with the one large product.

              Students often confuse the words factor and multiple of whole numbers. Note       IN

              that a factor cannot be larger than the original number. A number is actually a

              factor (and a multiple) of itself.

The first technique we will learn is one of the building blocks we must master in order to factor more complex
polynomials in future sections.

Problem 29.1

Factor.

                                                  18 + 12

The largest number we can divide both 18 and 12 by is 6. To remove the 6, we will divide both 18 by 6 and 12
by 6.

                                                    18 + 12 = 6 18 + 12
                                                                          66

                                                                 = 6(3 + 2)
We should always check our factoring is correct by multiplying. We can check by distributing the 6. Let's check.

                               6(3 + 2) = 6(3) + 6(2)
                                            = 18 + 12 

We see that after multiplying, we are back to the original problem.

200                   GPS 29: Removing the Greatest Common Factor

              Removing the greatest common factor is like distributing in reverse.                 PB

              Recall that distributing looks like this

                                       (  +  ) =  + 

              Removing the greatest common factor looks exactly the opposite.

                                        +  = ( + )

                            27 + 18                                                24 - 40

                                                        

In the previous problems, there were no variables in the second term. When there are variables in all the terms,

you may also be able to factor out the variable. You should ask yourself, "What is the largest number of each

variable I can factor from every term?"

Problem 29.4

Factor.

                                           83 + 62

We start by looking at the coefficients 8 and 6. The largest number we can factor from both 8 and 6 is 2. We
now look at the variable . In the first term we have 3, and in the second term we have 2. Since we must
factor the same number from each term, the most we can remove is 2. As a result, the greatest common factor
is 22. We will divide 83 by 22 and 62 by 22

                                                                          83 62
                                                 83 + 62 = 22  2 + 2

                                                                          2 2
                                                               = 22(4 + 3)

We always check factoring by multiplying.

                                               22(4 + 3) = 22(4) + 22(3)
                                                             = 83 + 62

Problem 29.7

Factor.

                                           1823 - 125

This problem is no more difficult than the previous problems. In this problem, we will first consider the

coefficients, then we will consider each variable one at a time. First we note that the largest number we can
factor out of 18 and 12 is 6. Next, we look at the 's. The first term has an 2 but the second term has only . As
a result, the largest number of 's we can factor is . Finally, we look at the 's. The first term has 3 and the
second term has 5. Hence we can only factor 3 from both terms. All combined, the greatest common factor is
63.

                                1823 - 125 = 63 1823 125 3 - 3 
                                             6                         6

                                           = 63(3 - 22)

We again check by multiplying.

                                63(3 - 22) = (63)(3) - (63)(22)
                                                    = 1823 - 125

In all the previous examples, there were only two terms. But we can use the same technique when there are

three or more terms.

Problem 29.10

Factor.

                      21222 + 143 - 352

We start by observing that the largest number we factor out of 21, 14 and 35 is 7. The most number of 's we
can factor out of each term is 2. We can only factor out  from each term. We note we cannot factor out any

's since the last term does not have any 's. Combining these observations, the greatest common factor is
72.

               21222 + 143 - 352 = 72 21222 143 352 2 + 2 - 2 
                                             7   7  7 

                                           = 72(32 + 2 - 5)

Finally, we check by multiplying.

                         72(32 + 2 - 5) = (72)(32) + (72)(2) - (72)(5)
                                                    = 21222 + 143 - 352

In one of our last and most important situations, the factor we wish to remove is actually a binomial rather than
just a monomial.

Problem 29.13

                                                       2( + 4) + 3( + 4)

This problem looks different, but we shouldn't let our mind trick us into thinking this problem is hard. We notice
that a common factor of each term is  + 4.

                                                       2( + 4) + 3( + 4)

                                                             Both terms have

When we factor out the  + 4 from the first term, there is a 2 left. When we factor out the  + 4 from the
second term, there is a 3 left.

  2( + 4) + 3( + 4) = ( + 4)(2 + 3)

Our final factored form is ( + 4)(2 + 3).

GPS 30: Factoring by Grouping

In this section, we will add one additional step to our previous problems. We start by reviewing a problem at the
end of the last section.

Problem 30.1

Factor.
                                                   3(2 - 5) - 2(2 - 5)

We notice that a common factor of each term is 2 - 5.
                                                   3(2 - 5) - 2(2 - 5)

                                                           Both terms have

When we factor out the 2 - 5 from the first term, there is a 3 left. When we factor out the 2 - 5 from
the second term, there is a -2 left.

                                    3(2 - 5) - 2(2 - 5) = (2 - 5)(3 - 2)

Our final factored form is (2 - 5)(3 - 2).     Problem 30.3

206                           GPS 30: Factoring by Grouping

Notice that in these problems, there was an obvious factor to remove in each piece. In the next problem, we will
have to first determine what the common factor is by grouping terms together with a common factor.

Problem 30.4

Factor.

                                 - 3 + 6 - 18

We start by breaking these four terms into two groups.

                                 - 3 + 6 - 18

We will factor out the greatest common factor from each group. In the first group, we factor out an . In the
second group, we factor our a 6.

                             - 3 + 6 - 18 = ( - 3) + 6( - 3)

Now this expression looks like what we have been working with already. The last step is to factor out the  - 3.
                                            ( - 3) + 6( - 3) = ( - 3)( + 6)

We must pause to check our work. To check factoring, we multiply.

                                                                          6

                                                                   6

                            -3                  -3                 -18

There are no like terms to combine, so the product is
                                        ( - 3)( + 6) =  + 6 - 3 - 18 

Notice the terms are in a different order than the original problem, but the terms are all the same and all have

the same sign as the original. The factored form is ( - 3)( + 6).


              Order of the terms when checking

              When checking factoring problems, you may get a polynomial with the terms         IN

              written in a different order than your original problem. In this case, make sure

              you have all the same terms and each term has the same sign as in the original

              problem. If they are all the same, then it they are equal.

              For example:

                             - 3 + 6 - 18 and  + 6 - 3 - 18

              are equal because the terms  , -3 , 6 and -18 are in both polynomials.

  Order of the factors in the answer
  Recall that when multiplying numbers, the order of the factors does not matter. IN
  The same is true for polynomials. You must have the same exact factors, but in
  any order you wish.
  For example:
  Both of the following two answers are correct.

                          - 3 + 6 - 18 = ( - 3)( + 6) 
                          - 3 + 6 - 18 = ( + 6)( - 3)

Problem 30.6

Factor.
                                                    8 - 20 - 6 + 15

We begin this problem much the same as the last one.

                                                   8 - 20 - 6 + 15

The first of these two groups is easy to factor. We will factor out a 4 from each term. But there is a tiny
difference between this problem and the previous ones. This problem has a subtraction joining the two groups

                                                 8 - 20 - 6 + 15

This means in the second group, we must factor out a -3 and not just a 3.

                                                                       The sign is the opposite
                                                                       because of the subtraction.

                      8 - 20 - 6 + 15 = 4(2 - 5) - 3(2 - 5)
                                                           = (2 - 5)(4 - 3)

We are never done without first checking our answer.

                                                      4  -3

                      2                               8  -6

                      -5  -20                            15

There are again no like terms to combine. We get
                                                    8 - 6 - 20 + 15

Notice the terms are in a different order than the original problem, but the terms are all the same and all have
the same sign as the original.

GPS 31: Factoring Trinomials by Grouping - Part 1

So far we have only used the Factor by Grouping technique on polynomials with four terms. In this section, we
will see how to apply this technique to a trinomial which you recall has only three terms.

Problem 31.1

Factor. Check your answer by multiplying.

                                           62 + 17 + 5

This polynomial has only three terms, and so we cannot start by dividing into two groups of two terms as we
have done previously. Instead, our strategy will be to break the +17 into two pieces to give us a total of four
pieces we can factor by grouping.

                                                           62 +17 + 5

                                                         62 +? ? +? ? + 5
Our first goal is to find two terms that add to +17. But recall in the next step of Factor by Grouping, we will
remove a common factor from each group. This means each new term must also have a factor in common with
6 and 5. To ensure this, we will calculate the grouping number which is (6)(5) = 30. In summary, we must find
two numbers that add to 17 and that multiply to 30.

We start by looking for two numbers that multiply to 30, and then      Multiply to              Sum of the
check to see if their sum is 17. From looking at the table to the
right, we see that 2 and 15 are the numbers we need. We can use            30                   numbers
these two numbers to break up our original trinomial.
                                                                       1       30               31          
                                                           62 +17 + 5
                                                                       2       15               17          

                                                                       3       10               13          

                                                                       5       6                11          

                                           62 +2 +15 + 5

We break this new polynomial into two groups, and then complete the factoring.

                                           62 + 2 + 15 + 5

                                           2(3 + 1) + 5(3 + 1)

                                           (3 + 1)(2 + 5)

As always, we check by multiplying.

                                                    2                  5

                                     3              62                 15

                                     1              2                  5

After combining like terms, we get our original polynomial back: 62 + 17 + 5.

Problem 32.1

Factor. Check your answer by multiplying.

                                                           22 - 11 + 12

We start by calculating the Grouping Number. The Grouping Number is (2)(12) = 24. The coefficient of the
linear term is -11. We must find two numbers whose product is 24 and whose sum is -11. Recall that if the
product of two numbers is positive, both numbers must be positive or both numbers must be negative. In this
case, since the sum is negative, we know both numbers must be negative.

We start by looking for all pairs of two negative numbers that         Multiply to              Sum of the
multiply to 24 and then check to see if their sum is -11. From              24
looking at the table to the right, we see that -3 and -8 are the                                numbers
numbers we need. We can use these two numbers to break up our          -1 -24
original trinomial.                                                    -2 -12                   -25         
                                                                       -3 -8

                                                                                                -10

                                                      22 - 3 - 8 + 12

                                         (2 - 3)( - 4)

Our final factored polynomial is (2 - 3)( - 4).

As always, we check by multiplying.

Factor. Check your answer by multiplying.

                                         102 +  - 2

We start by calculating the Grouping Number. The Grouping Number is (10)(-2) = -20. The coefficient of the
linear term is +1. We must find two numbers whose product is -20 and whose sum is +1. Recall that if the
product of two numbers is negative, then one number must be positive and one number must be negative. In
this case, since the sum is positive, we know that the "larger" (ignoring the signs) of the two numbers must be
positive and the "smaller" must be negative.

We start by looking for all pairs of numbers that multiply to -20      Multiply to              Sum of the
and then check to see if their sum is 1. We assign the "larger"
(ignoring the sign of the number) to be positive and the "smaller"         -20                  numbers
to be negative. From looking at the table to the right, we see that
-4 and 5 are the numbers we need. We can use these two                 -1 20                    19          
numbers to break up our original trinomial.

                                         (5 - 2)(2 + 1)

GPS 35: Factoring a Difference of Squares

There is one type of polynomial that appears quite often in factoring problems.

  Difference of Squares Formula                                                                     PB

Problem 35.1

Factor. Check your answer by multiplying.

                                           92 - 16

In order to use the Difference of Squares Formula, we must verify this is a difference of squares.

We check 3 things:

    1) There are two terms with a subtraction between them.
    2) The first term 92 is a perfect square. We see that (3)2 = 92.
    3) The second term 16 is a perfect square. We see that 42 = 16.

The Difference of Squares Formula applies.
                                                  92 - 16 = (3)2 - 42
                                                               = (3 - 4)(3 + 4)

In factored form, the answer is (3 - 4)(3 + 4).

As always, we must now check that our factorization is correct by multiplying.

                                           3                           4

                       3                   92                          12

                       -4                  -12               -16

Notice that the terms on the diagonal are opposites, and hence their sum is zero. This leaves our original

polynomials 92 - 16. 



We will guide you through your first difference of squares.

First we check that this is a difference of squares.

     1) Are there two terms with a subtraction between them?

     2) Is the first term a perfect square? If so, fill in the blank: ????????2 = 252

                                                                                                           ????????

GPS 36: Multistep Factoring

For now, we have learned all the different techniques for factoring. In the following problems we will combine
the techniques we have already learned. When we factor a polynomial, we usually break it into two factors
which are also polynomials. We can sometimes factor a factor again. This is like breaking a huge rock into two
big rocks, and then breaking the big rocks into even smaller rocks.

In this section, you will see the instructions change from "Factor" to "Factor completely." When you are told to
"Factor completely," you must factor every factor as many times as possible until you can no longer factor it any
more.

Problem 36.1

Factor completely.

                    23 - 32

    1. Factor out the Greatest Common Factor
When factoring completely, one always starts by factoring out the greatest common factor. The greatest
common factor of this polynomial is 2.

                                                    23 - 32 = 2(2 - 16)

    2. Factor each factor.
There are two factors. The first factor is 2 which cannot be factored any more. The second factor is 2 - 16
which we recognize is a difference of squares. We now factor the difference of squares.

                    23 - 32 = 2(2 - 16)

                                             = 2( + 4)( - 4)

                    Don't forget to bring down
                        the factors from the
                           previous step.

    3. Check if any factor can be factored again.
We have factored this polynomial into three factors 2,  + 4, and  - 4. None of these factors can be factored
again, so this is our final answer.

In completely factored form,

                                                 23 - 32 = 2( + 4)( - 4)

GPS 37: Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring

In this section, we will see one reason why we have learned to factor.

Problem 37.1

Find all solutions to the equation.

                                                          22 + 7 + 3 = 0

We start by factoring the polynomial 22 + 7 + 3. The Grouping Number is (2)(3) = 6 and the linear
coefficient is 7. We can easily spot the two numbers we need to split the middle term is 6 and 1.

                                                               22 + 7 + 3 = 0
                                                          22 + 6 +  + 3 = 0
                                                    2( + 3) + 1( + 3) = 0

                                                           ( + 3)(2 + 1) = 0

We now make use of the Zero Product Property which says, "If the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the
numbers must be equal to 0." In our case, this translates to one of the factors must be zero. We proceed by
breaking our one equation into two simpler equations.

                                  ( + 3)(2 + 1) = 0

                                   + 3 = 0    or 2 + 1 = 0

                                  Both of these equations are easy to solve.

                                   + 3 = 0    2 + 1 = 0
                                        = -3
                                                   2 = -1
                                                             1

                                                     = - 2

This equation has two solutions.               = -3 or  = - 1

                                                                            2

We highlight a very important property we needed while working this problem.

Zero Product Property                                                                           PB

If the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be equal to 0.

                                  If    = 0, then  = 0 or  = 0.

In order to use the Zero Product Property, our product must first be equal to zero. Often we must rearrange the
equation before factoring and using the Zero Product Property.

Problem 37.5

Find all solutions to the equation.

                                         32 = 12

Before we can factor this equation, we must subtract 12 from both sides so it will equal zero.

                                                               32 = 12
                                                        32 -  = 12 - 
                                                        32 - 12 = 0

Now that the equation is equal to zero, we can factor and solve.
                                                                 32 - 12 = 0
                                                                3(2 - 4) = 0

                                                        3( - 2)( + 2) = 0

To factor this polynomial, we first removed the greatest common factor. Then we factored the difference of
squares. We now set each factor to 0.

  30                                 or   - 2 = 0                             or   + 2 = 0

  A constant factor is                    = 2                                                    = -2

  never equal to zero!

The solutions are  = 2 or  = -2. Sometimes you will this abbreviated by writing  = 2.

Square Roots and Operations

GPS 39: Introduction to Square Roots

What is a square root?

Squaring a number means to multiply the number by itself. For example, 32 = 3  3 = 9. Finding the square
root is the opposite of squaring a number.

Square Root                                                                                     PB

To find the square root of a number, we ask,

             What nonnegative number times itself equals our number?

For example, the square root of 9 is 3 since we just saw that 32 = 9. We write
this using symbols as 9 = 3.

Unfortunately, most whole numbers don't have whole number square roots. Without a calculator, it is difficult
to find the square root of most numbers. Instead, we learn to recognize common squares and approximate
answers when we must.

A whole number whose square root is also a whole number is called a perfect square.

252                             GPS 39: Introduction to Square Roots

Sometimes we need help breaking apart large numbers into smaller numbers that are easier to compute. The
following rule is helpful for this purpose.

              The Product Rule                                                           PB

              When two nonnegative numbers are multiplied under the square root, we can

              split the term into two square roots being multiplied.

                                 = 

Problem 39.1

Simplify.

                                16  9

We use the above rule to "split" the square root. That is, 16  9 = 16  9.
But, we know that 16 = 4 and that 9 = 3. So, we have

                                                         16  9 = 16  9
                                                                   =43
                                                                   = 12



   Problem 39.2                    Problem 39.3

Simplify.                       Simplify.

                 25  16                                                    36  49

What if one of the numbers is not a perfect square?

Problem 39.4

Simplify.
                                                                25  2

We follow our steps from the previous problem. However, we keep in mind that we do not know the square
root of 2. So, we have

                                                  25  2 = 252 (splitting the square root)
                                                            = 52 (replacing 25 by 5)

Since we do not know the exact value of 2, we leave it in the final answer as it is.
                                                            25  2 = 52

What about Whole Numbers that aren't Perfect Squares?

Problem 39.7

Simplify.

                                                                  12
The first thing we notice is that 12 is not a perfect square. But let's look closer at its factors.

                                     12 =  4  3

                     We know the square root of the         We do not know the square root
                                 first number.
                                                                   of the second number.
                     4 is the largest factor of 12 that is
                              a perfect square.

We can break 12 into two factors.

In simplified form,  12 = 4  3
                           = 4  3 We break the square root into two pieces.
                           = 23 We replace 4 with 2.

                                                    12 = 23

   Problem 39.8

Simplify.

                                                                  18

    1. Think of a way you can write 18 as the product of two numbers so that the following is true:
              a. You know how to take the square root of the first number. It's a perfect square.
              b. The second number is not divisible by a perfect square.
                                                                   18 = ( )  ( )

    2. Now break the square root into two pieces using the two numbers you just found.

     3. Take the square root of the perfect square.

The final answer is_____________.

     when learning to factor. First make a list      1 96                1

     of all pairs of numbers that multiply to        2 48

     the number under the square root. Then 3 32

     find all perfect squares in your list. Use      4 24                4

             96 = 16  6                              8 12

                      = 46

     If you use a smaller perfect square, you 1 is never useful for breaking apart

     will have to break down the square root square roots.

             96 = 4  24                              16 is the largest!

             = 224

Simplify.

                                  328

Now, we keep 3 outside and simplify the 28. So, we have

               328 = 34  7 We know the square root of 4.
                      = 347
                      = 3  27 Replace 4 by 2. Note the multiplication sign.
                      = 67

In simplified form, 328 = 67

When two nonnegative numbers are divided under the square root, we can split

them into two square roots being divided.

At first, it may be tempting to try to attempt to reduce this fraction since 24 and 10 are both divisible by 2. But
since 10 is not under a square root, we cannot do this. We must only reduce when both numbers are under a
square root or when both numbers are not under a square root.

     24 = 4  6 we simplify the square root first

Here, we can use our Product and Quotient Rules to first bring everything under a single root. So,

                                              615 = 6  15
                                              5  5

Now, we can reduce the fraction inside, since 15 and 5 have a common factor. So,

                                              615 = 6  15
                                              5  5

GPS 40: Operations with Square Roots

We will consider problems with addition and subtraction. Here we must take care to only combine terms that
have the same square roots.

              Addition and Subtraction of Radicals                                              PB

              If ,  and  are numbers, then we can add and subtract terms with the same

              square root.

                             +  = ( + )

                                                 -  = ( - )
              This is just like adding and subtracting like-terms.

Problem 40.1

Simplify.

                                                              23 + 53
Both of these terms have 3 in common. Thus we can add their coefficients.

                                                     23 + 53 = (2 + 5)3
                                                                    = 73

Problem 40.6

Simplify.

                                                            218 + 332

At first glance it appears as though we cannot combine these terms because they are not like terms. However,
we can take a moment to simplify each radical.

     218 + 332 = 29  2 + 316  2 Simplify each term like in the previous section.
                       = 292 + 3162
                       = 2  3  2 + 3  4  2
                       = 62 + 122 After simplifying, we see these are like terms.
                       = 182

Our final answer is                 218 + 332 = 182

We remind ourselves that the same rules of multiplication and the distributive property still apply.

Problem 40.11

Simplify completely.

                                                            26 + 2

We start by distributing the 2.

                                                 26 + 2 = 26 + 22
                                                                   = 12 + 4

But now we must simplify each radical.

                                                      12 + 4 = 4  3 + 2
                                                                    = 23 + 2

We cannot combine them further. This is the final answer.

                                                     26 + 2 = 23 + 2

GPS 41: Pythagorean Theorem

Right triangles have one right angle (90 angle). The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse.

This square means this is                                      This longest side is called
                                                                 the hypotenuse. It is
   a right angle. It                                              always opposite the
                                                                       right angle.
      measures 90.

There is a special relationship between the sides in a right triangle. This unique property only applies to right
triangles. You have almost certainly encountered it before.

The Pythagorean Theorem                                                                         PB

In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the

squares of the legs.

                                     2 + 2 = 2

                      

                                                     The hypotenuse is

                                                      always by itself.
                      

We will combine this with one final property of square roots.

The Square Root of a Nonnegative Squared                                                        PB

If  is any nonnegative number, then

                                            2 = 
By taking the square root of 2, we can get back to  itself.

Problem 41.1

What is the value of  in the right triangle?

                                                           2 

                                                              3

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem with  = 2 and  = 3. The hypotenuse is .

                                2 + 2 = 2
                                22 + 32 = 2 We use  for the side we do not know.

                                   4 + 9 = 2
                                       13 = 2 We now take the square root of both sides.

                                     13 = 2
                                     13 = 

The length of the missing side is 13 units.

What is the value of  in the right triangle?

                                              4

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem with  = 4 and  = 6.

                                              2 + 2 = 2
                                              42 + 2 = 62
                                              16 + 2 = 36

Note that the 2 is not by itself on one side of the equals sign. We cannot just take the square root. First we
must isolate 2 on one side of the equals sign. To do this, we subtract 16 from both sides.

                                     16 + 2 = 36
                              16 -  + 2 = 36 - 

                                            2 = 20 Now we see the 2 is by itself.

                                              = 20 We take the square root of both sides.

                                              = 4  5 We should simplify, when possible.
