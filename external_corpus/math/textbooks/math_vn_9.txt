Watch the Video: Popular Vote vs. the Electoral College and take notes.

Consider a small country with 3 states. The rules for the number of senators and electors are
the same as the U.S. government. Each state gets 1 representative for every 25,000 residents.
Determine the number of electors for each state and the total for the country.

   State     Population      Number of                   Number of    Number of
Small           75,000    Representatives                 Senators      Electors
Medium         350,000
Large          500,000

The total number of electors in the Electoral College is _______________.

How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election? _______________

There are 2 candidates for the president, Candidate A and Candidate B. When a candidate
wins in a state, they get all the electoral votes for that state. Determine who wins the
popular vote and who wins the electoral college vote.

Total Votes     236,000      264,000

The winner of the popular vote is _______________.
The winner of the electoral college is _______________.

Which method do you think is more fair and why?

Some states have passed a National Popular Vote bill which assigns a state's electoral
votes based on the popular vote. https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/

Electoral Power
Electoral Power is

Let's calculate the electoral power of each state. Fill in the number of electors from the
previous table. Then find the number of electoral votes per 25,000 people (you can ignore
any remainder). Round to 2 decimal places.

  State   Population     Number of     Number of  Number of Electoral Votes
Small        75,000   Representatives   Senators    Electors per 25,000 people
Medium      350,000
Large       500,000

          5.4: Gerrymandering and Solutions

Apportionment determines how many representatives are given to each state. Then each
state draws the districts that elect one representative each.

Watch the videos and look for the following information.

1. How often does redistricting happen?

2. What are the two rules for drawing district lines?
       i.
      ii.

3. Who determines where the district lines are drawn?

4. There are two types of gerrymandering.
    What is cracking?

    What is packing?

5. What is gerrymandering?

Proportionality and Fairness

There is nothing in our constitution or laws that says representation must be proportional,
but that seems like a basic measure of fairness.

a. If a state with 10 districts is 3 Democrats and 2 Republicans, how many seats would
                               5              5
each party get if the representation was proportional?

b. If a state with 9 districts is 42.3% Democrats and 57.7% Republicans, how many seats
    would each party get if the representation was proportional? It usually doesn't come
    out exactly so you can say what is closest to fair.

How to Measure Gerrymandering: The Efficiency Gap

Example 1. The votes are shown for five districts in a hypothetical state. Determine the
number of seats won and calculate the efficiency gap.

Election Results:    District     D Votes     R Votes    D Wasted Votes  R Wasted Votes
                         1                75         25
Democrats win            2                60         40
              seats      3                43         57
                         4                48         52
Republicans win          5                49         51
              seats
                      Total

Efficiency Gap = Party A Wasted Votes - Party B Wasted Votes =
                                               Total Votes

A maximum efficiency gap of ____________________% is currently being proposed.
