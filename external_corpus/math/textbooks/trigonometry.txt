Preface

We have tried to make this edition of Trigonometry useful to students in a
variety of programs. For example, students who have encountered elements of
triangle trig in previous courses may be able to skip all or part of Chapters
1 through 3. Students preparing for technical courses may not need much of
the material after Chapter 6 or 7. Chapters 9 and 10 cover vectors and polar
coordinates, optional topics that occur in some trigonometry courses but are
often reserved for precalculus.

    There are many reasons why students might find trigonometry difficult,
among them:

· The subject inherently involves a great deal of technical detail, which can
   be allowed to obscure the main ideas.

· The subject is often taught with the analytical rigor appropriate to a
   precalculus course -- before students have acquired the necessary facility
   with functions.

In his beautiful book, Trigonometric Delights, Eli Maor enjoins us "Let's not

forget that trigonometry is, first and foremost, a practical discipline, born out

of and deeply rooted in applications." After the New Math "[f]ormal definitions

and legalistic verbosity--all in the name of mathematical rigor--replaced a real

understanding of the subject." And formalism is "... certainly not the best way

to motivate the beginning student."

The typical trigonometry student has just completed a second course in

algebra. He or she has a nodding acquaintance with functions and is still
                                           5 - 3
very wary of irrational numbers. A statement such as "sin =     " may
                                           3                 2
well be greeted with panic and bewilderment. So we do not begin with a

preliminary chapter covering all the mathematical topics needed for the rest of

the course, including elements of analytic geometry and properties of functions

such as domain and range, symmetry, transformations, composition, and inverse

functions. (This material usually comprises most of a precalculus course, which

is usually taught after trigonometry, where it is introduced using more familiar,

hence easier, functions as examples.)

Nor do we begin with a chapter about angles, including coterminal and

reference angles, converting degrees to minutes and seconds, radians, arc length,

and angular velocity, before the trig ratios are even mentioned. We have tried

to address these issues as follows:

· Chapter 1 reviews only the most basic facts about triangles and circles
   that students will need to begin their study of trigonometry, and may be
   omitted or assigned as homework. Other facts about functions and angles
   are introduced when they are needed. For example, minutes and seconds

                                       iv
                                                                                                     v

       are discussed in the context of parallax in the section on Law of Sines in
       Chapter 3. Nautical bearings occur in Section 4.1, Angles and Rotation.

   · Chapter 2 introduces the three (not six) basic trig ratios, and considers
       angles in the first quadrant only. We believe this initial simplicity allows
       students to focus on the fundamental concepts without simultaneously
       trying to master a welter of peripheral detail.

   · In Chapter 3 we introduce reference angles for the second quadrant
       in order to study obtuse triangles and the Laws of Sines and Cosines.
       Reference angles are covered again in more generality in Chapter 4.

   · Chapter 4 considers angles as rotations in preparation for the graphs of
       sine and cosine. Note that the applications of periodic functions in this
       chapter are functions of degrees only, to fit with our approach: radians
       come later, after students have some experience with sinusoidal graphs.

   · Chapter 5 begins with a section on algebraic manipulations with trig
       ratios, a skill that is often neglected but can engender endless confusion
       for students. This chapter treats only simple equations and identities;
       more equations and identities appear in Chapters 7 and 8. We solve
       equations both graphically and analytically, and we use graphs as well as
       algebra to verify trigonometric identities.

   · Chapter 6 introduces radians and the circular functions of real numbers.
       Most of this chapter and Chapter 7 revisit basic skills such as analyzing
       graphs and solving equations, but working now in radians rather than
       degrees.

   · Chapter 8 studies identities and their use in more detail, including the
       sum and difference formulas and the double angle identities. Inverse trig
       functions are included here, and are the three reciprocal trig functions.

   · Chapters 9 and 10 cover ancillary topics; typical trigonometry courses
       may include one or more of these topics: vectors, polar coordinates, and
       complex numbers.

    In addition to the Homework Problems, each Example in the book is followed
by a similar Exercise for students to test their understanding. Each Section
concludes with a Summary , a set of Study Questions, and a list of Skills to
be addressed in the Homework. A Summary and a set of Review Problems
follows each chapter. Chapters 1 through 8 include Activities for students to
work through some of the main ideas. We have described the use of a graphing
calculator, but other graphing utilities can easily be substituted.

    Throughout we have been guided by the Rule of Four and use tables
and graphical representation to illustrate concepts. We have taken care to
include numerical examples and diagrams, both in Examples and in Homework
Problems, to offer students some intuitive understanding for the more abstract
ideas of trigonometry. Above all, we have tried to focus on the fundamental ideas
of trigonometry by introducing them in their most basic form and returning
later to look at them in greater detail.

Triangles and Circles

   · Angles and Triangles
   · Similar Triangles
   · Circles

    Circles and triangles are the simplest geometric figures. A circle is the
simplest sort of curve, and a triangle is the simplest polygon -- the one with
the fewest sides. Each has properties that makes it useful in many fields of
endeavor. A triangle is the most stable of polygons, because once its sides are
fixed in length, its angles cannot change. A triangular truss bridge is a stable
structure. A three-legged stool will not wobble.

    A circle encloses more area then any other figure of the same length, or
perimeter, and a sphere encloses more space. A geodesic dome is a portion of a
sphere constructed with triangles. It has been called "the strongest, lightest
and most efficient means of enclosing space known to man."

    Geodesic domes may also help us learn how to live on another planet. In
2017, the United Arab Emirates began construction on Mars Science City, a
series of interconnecting geodesic domes designed to be a realistic model for
living on Mars. The city will cover 1.9 million square feet, and its walls will be
3D-printed using sand from the desert.

    The city will contain laboratories to address food, sustainability, and energy
issues all over the world. Finally, the project will implement an experiment
wherein a team will spend a year living in the simulated planet for a year.

Activity 1.1 Properties of Triangles.
    Materials: You will need paper and pencil, scissors, a ruler and compass,

and two plastic straws.
    Prepare: Cut the straw into pieces of lengths 2 inches, 3 inches, and 6 inches.

Use the ruler to draw a large triangle, and cut it out.
   A What do we know about the sides of a triangle?
           1 a Can you make a triangle with sides of length 2 inches, 3 inches,
                    and 6 inches?
                b Use the pieces of length 2 inches and 3 inches to form two sides
                    of a triangle. What happens to the length of the third side as
                   you increase the angle between the first two sides?
                 c What is the longest that the third side could be? What is the
                    smallest?
           2 Two sides of a triangle are 6 centimeters and 8 centimeters long.
              What are the possible lengths of the third side?
           3 Two sides of a triangle are p units and q units long. What are the
              possible lengths of the third side?
    B What do we know about the angles of a triangle?
           1 Use a protractor to measure the three angles of the paper triangle
              in degrees. Now add up the three angles. What is their sum?
           2 Tear off the three corners of the triangle. Place them side-by-side
              with their vertices (tips) at the same point. What do you find?

3 How are your answers to parts (1) and (2) related?

C How are the sides and angles of a triangle related?

1 A standard way to label a triangle is to call the angles A, B, and C.
  The side opposite angle A is called a, the side opposite angle B is
   called b, and the side opposite angle C is called c. Sketch a triangle
   and label it with standard notation.

2 Using a ruler, carefully draw a triangle and label it with standard
   notation so that a > b > c. Now use a protractor to measure the
   angles and list them in order from largest to smallest. What do you
   observe?

3 Using a ruler, carefully draw another triangle and label it with
   standard notation so that A > B > C. Now use a ruler to measure
   the sides and list them in order from largest to smallest. What do
  you observe?

D What do we know about right triangles?

1 The side opposite the 90 angle in a right triangle is called the
   hypotenuse. Why is the hypotenuse always the longest side of a
   right triangle?

2 The Pythagorean theorem states that:

IF:         a, b, and c are the sides of a right triangle, and c is the
THEN:       hypotenuse
            a2 + b2 = c2

The "if" part of the theorem is called the hypothesis, and the "then"
part is called the conclusion. The converse of a theorem is the
new statement you obtain when you interchange the hypothesis and
the conclusion. Write the converse of the Pythagorean theorem.

3 The converse of the Pythagorean theorem is also true. Use the
   converse to decide whether each of the following triangles is a right
   triangle. Support your conclusions with calculations.

a a = 9, b = 16, c = 25

b a = 12, b = 16, c = 20
                         
c a = 8, b = 5, c = 13

1.1 Angles and Triangles

Historically, trigonometry began as the study of triangles and their properties.
Let's review some definitions and facts from geometry.

   · We measure angles in degrees.
   · One full rotation is 360, as shown below.
   · Half a full rotation is 180 and is called a straight angle.
   · One quarter of a full rotation is 90 and is called a right angle.
CHAPTER 1. TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES                                          4

          90 180 270                                      360

Triangles

If you tear off the corners of any triangle and line them up, as shown below,
they will always form a straight angle.

                y                               xyz

             x                     z  x            z

                     Sum of angles in a triangle.
1. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180.

Example 1.1

Two of the angles in the triangle at right are                   115 x
25 and 115. Find the third angle.                         25

Solution. To find the third angle, we write an equation.

            x + 25 + 115 = 180        Simpify the left side.
                   x + 140 = 180      Subtract 140 from both sides.
                           x = 40

    The third angle is 40.
Checkpoint 1.2

                                                                                             2x

Find each of the angles in the triangle at right.

                                                     x    2x - 15

Answer. x = 39, 2x = 78, 2x - 15 = 63
    Some special categories of triangles are particularly useful. Most important

of these are the right triangles.

                               Right triangle.
2. A right triangle has one angle of 90.

Example 1.3
CHAPTER 1. TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES                                                                    5

        One of the smaller angles of a right tri- 34
        angle is 34. What is the third angle?

                                                                                                 x
Solution. The sum of the two smaller angles in a right triangle is 90. So

x + 34 = 90                    Subtract 34 from both sides.
      x = 56

    The unknown angle must be 56.

Checkpoint 1.4 Two angles of a triangle are 35 and 45. Can it be a right
triangle?

Answer. No
    An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.

             Angles of equilateral triangle.

3. All of the angles of an equilateral triangle are equal.

Example 1.5

All three sides of a triangle are 4 feet long. Find     4x4
the angles.
                                                          xx
                                                             4

Solution. The triangle is equilateral, so all of its angles are equal. Thus

                    3x = 180   Divide both sides by 3.
                     x = 60

    Each of the angles is 60.
Checkpoint 1.6

Find x, y, and z in the triangle at right.              y 60 8

                                                          60 x
                                                             z

Answer. x = 60, y = 8, z = 8
    An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length. The angle between the

equal sides is the vertex angle. The other two angles are the base angles.

             Base angles of an isosceles triangle.

4. The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.
CHAPTER 1. TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES                                                                            6

Example 1.7

Find x and y in the triangle at right.   12                                            x  12

                                         y                                                38

Solution. The triangle is isosceles, so the base angles are equal. Therefore,
y = 38. To find the vertex angle, we solve

x + 38 + 38 = 180                        Subtract 76 from both sides.
      x + 76 = 180
             x = 104

    The vertex angle is 104.             9xy
Checkpoint 1.8                           20                                               20

   Find x and y in the figure at right.

Answer. x = 140, y = 9

Angles

In addition to the facts about triangles reviewed above, there are several useful
properties of angles.

   · Two angles that add to 180 are called supplementary.
   · Two angles that add to 90 are called complementary.
   · Angles between 0 and 90 are called acute.
   · Angles between 90 and 180 are called obtuse.

supplementary angles complementary angles acute angle                                     obtuse angle

Example 1.9                                                                                     C
  In the figure at right,                                                              O

In trigonometry we often use lower-case Greek letters to represent unknown
angles (or, more specifically, the measure of the angle in degrees). In the next
exercise, we use the Greek letters  (alpha),  (beta), and  (gamma).

b Find the measure of angle .                          50
c Find the measure of angle .                      

d What do you notice about the measures
   of the angles?

Answer.  = 130,  = 50,  = 130. The non-adjacent angles are equal.

    Non-adjacent angles formed by the intersection of two straight lines are
called vertical angles. In the previous exercise, the angles labeled  and 
are vertical angles, as are the angles labeled  and 50.

                 Vertical Angles.

5. Vertical angles are equal.

Example 1.11

Explain why  =  in the triangle at right.            

                                                          

Solution. Because they are the base angles of an isosceles triangle,  (theta)
and  (phi) are equal. Also,  =  because they are vertical angles, and similarly
 = . Therefore,  =  because they are equal to equal quantities.

Answer.  = 40,  = 140,  = 75,  = 65

    A line that intersects two parallel lines forms eight angles, as shown in the
figure below. There are four pairs of vertical angles, and four pairs of corre-
sponding angles, or angles in the same position relative to the transversal on
each of the parallel lines.

For example, the angles labeled 1 and 5 are                    12
corresponding angles, as are the angles labeled             34
4 and 8. Finally, angles 3 and 6 are called
alternate interior angles, and so are angles           56
4 and 5.                                             78

                    Paralles lines cut by a transversal.

    6. If parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the alternate
interior angles are equal. Corresponding angles are also equal.

Example 1.13
CHAPTER 1. TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES                                           8

The parallelogram ABCD shown at right             B                     C
is formed by the intersection of two sets of     26                35
parallel lines. Show that the opposite angles
of the parallelogram are equal.                     1            4
                                               A                    D

Solution. Angles 1 and 2 are equal because they are alternate interior angles,
and angles 2 and 3 are equal because they are corresponding angles. Therefore
angles 1 and 3, the opposite angles of the parallelogram, are equal. Similarly,
you can show that angles 4, 5, and 6 are equal.

Checkpoint 1.14 Show that the adjacent angles of a parallelogram are sup-
plementary. (You can use angles 1 and 4 in the parallelogram of the previous
example.)

Answer. Note that angles 2 and 6 are supplementary because they form a
straight angle. Angle 1 equals angle 2 because they are alternate interior angles,
and similarly angle 4 equals angle 5. Angle 5 equals angle 6 because they are
corresponding angles. Thus, angle 4 equals angle 6, and angle 1 equals angle 2.
So angles 4 and 1 are supplementary because 2 and 6 are.

1.2 Similar Triangles

Congruent Triangles

Two triangles are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape.
This means that their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding
sides have the same lengths, as shown below.

parts, and find the angles , , and , and side z.

                                                  D

   A

Solution. In these triangles, B = D because they are both right angles,
and BCA = DCE because they are vertical angles, so  = 25. The third
angles, A and E, must also be equal, so  =  = 65. (Do you see why?)
The sides opposite each pair of corresponding angles are equal, so AB = DE,
BC = CD and AC = CE. In particular, we find that z = 9.

Checkpoint 1.18

Answer.  = 85,  = 75,  = 85
    Recall that the altitude of a triangle is the segment from one vertex of the

triangle perpendicular to the opposite side.

Example 1.19 Show that the altitude of an equilateral triangle divides it into
two congruent right triangles.

   60

8      8       8                           8 8 30 30 8

                                               4     4

Solution. Consider for example an equilateral triangle of side 8 inches, as

shown above. The altitude is perpendicular to the base, so each half of the
original triangle is a right triangle. Because each right triangle contains a 60
CHAPTER 1. TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES                                          15

angle, the remaining angle in each triangle must be 90 - 60 = 30. Both
triangles have a side of length 8 between the angles of 30° and 60°, so they are
congruent. (Consequently, the short sides of the congruent triangles are equal,
so each is half the original base.)

    The triangles in the previous example are a special type of right triangle
called 30-60-90 triangles. Notice that in these triangles, the leg opposite
the 30 angle is half the length of the hypotenuse.

Checkpoint 1.20

The diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into       B        C

two congruent triangles, as shown at right. List

the corresponding parts of the two triangles, and

explain why each pair is equal.                    A        D

Answer. BCA = CAD and BAC = ACD because they are alternate
interior angles. If two pairs of angles in a triangle are equal, so is the third pair,

so B = D. BC = AD and AB = CD because they are opposite sides of a
parallelogram, and AC = AC.

Similar Triangles

Two triangles are similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily the
same size. The corresponding angles are equal, and the corresponding sides are
proportional. We can think of one similar triangle as an enlargement or a
reduction of the other. (See the figures below.)

B                                                     B

              c                  A = A
a                                B = B

BC    b          A               C = C             BC                  A

ac                               abc               C     A
C bA                                ==

                                 abc

    To decide whether two triangles are similar, it turns out that we need to
verify only one of the two conditions for similarity, and the other condition will
be true automatically.

                                      Similar Triangles.

         Two triangles are similar if either

         1 their corresponding angles are equal, or

         2 their corresponding sides are proportional.

Solution.

a We will check whether the corresponding sides are proportional. We com-

pute the ratios of the corresponding sides, making sure to write each ratio

in the same order,         larger triangle   . (The other order,    smaller triangle  ,

                           smaller triangle                         larger triangle

would also work, as long as we use the same order for all the ratios.)

                  9                          12                      15

Because all of these ratios are equal to 1.5, the triangles are similar.

b The ratios of corresponding sides are not equal: the ratio of the longest

similar.

c The missing angle of the first right triangle is 48, and the missing angle
  in the second right triangle is 42, so three pairs of angles match. The

  triangles are similar.

Answer. a. The triangles are similar because = = , so the sides are

                                                                6 9 12
proportional.

    b. The third angle in both triangles is 80, so the triangles are similar
because their corresponding angles are equal.

Note 1.23 In part (b) of the previous exercise, note that the third angle in
each triangle must be 80, because the sum of the angles is 180. Thus, we
need only show that two pairs of angles are equal to show that two triangles
are similar.

Using Proportions with Similar Triangles

The figure in the next example shows a parallelogram ABCD and two triangles,
  ABE and F CE. Can we find the unknown lengths x and y in the larger

triangle?
    First note that two pairs of corresponding angles in the triangles are equal:
CHAPTER 1. TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES                                        17

BEA and F EC are vertical angles, and EF C and BAE are alternate
interior angles. But if two pairs of corresponding angles are equal, then the
third pair must be equal also. This means that the two triangles are similar,
and we can use the fact that their corresponding sides are proportional to find
x and y.

Example 1.24

                                                                     F

                                                            B     E8 6
                                                                  4C
                                                               x

Find the value of x in the figure at right.              15 y

                                                         A        D

Solution. We see that x is the length of the shortest side in ABE. We
know the short side in F CE and the lengths of the medium sides in each
triangle. If we form the ratios of the short sides and the medium sides, we
obtain the following proportion.

larger triangle         x                       =        15

To solve the proportion, we cross-multiply to get

6x = 4(15) = 60         Divide both sides by 6.

        6

Caution 1.25 Remember that "cross-multiplying" is a short-cut technique for
solving proportions. It does not work for other operations involving fractions.

Checkpoint 1.26 Find the value of y in the previous example.
Answer. y = 20

Similar Right Triangles

If two right triangles have one pair of corresponding acute angles with the
same measure, then the triangles are similar. We can use this fact about right
triangles to make indirect measurements.

Example 1.27 Delbert would like to know the height of a certain building.
He gets Francine to hold up a 5-foot pole near the building and measures the
length of its shadow. The shadow of the pole is 3 feet long, and the shadow of
the building is 12 feet long.

a Use similar triangles to write a proportion involving the height of the
   building.

b Solve the proportion to find the height of the building.

Solution.

a In the figure above we see two right triangles: One triangle is formed by
   the building and its shadow, and the other by the pole and its shadow.
   Because the light rays from the sun are parallel, the two angles at the
   tips of the shadows are equal. Thus, the two right triangles are similar,
   and their corresponding sides are proportional. The ratios of heights and
   bases in the two triangles yield the proportion

                      larger triangle         h  =   12
                                           :

                      smaller triangle

b To solve the proportion, we cross-multiply to get

              3h = 5(12) = 60                 Divide both sides by 3.
                      60

                h = = 20
                       3

The building is 20 feet tall.

Checkpoint 1.28 Earlier we created a 30°-60°-90° triangle in which the shorter
leg was 4 inches and the hypotenuse was 8 inches. The hypotenuse of another
30°-60°-90° triangle is 5 feet. What is the length of the side opposite the 30°
angle?

Answer. 2.5 feet

Overlapping Triangles

In some applications, similar triangles may share a side or an angle.
Example 1.29

Identify two similar triangles in the figure                     10 H
at right, and write a proportion to find H.

                                                     24          12

Solution. The two triangles overlap, sharing the marked angle, as shown
below. Because each triangle also has a right angle, they are similar.

                                                              H
                          10

                      24       24 + 12

    Note that the base of the larger triangle is 24 + 12 = 36. The ratio of the
heights and the ratio of the bases must be equal, so we write the following
proportion.

             H 36              Cross-multiply.
                 =             Divide both sides by 24.

             10 24
           24H = 360

Concepts

    1 Two triangles are congruent if they have exactly the same size and
       shape.

    2 The altitude of an equilateral triangle divides it into two congruent right
       triangles.

    3 In a 30°-60°-90° right triangle, the leg opposite the 30° angle is half the
       length of the hypotenuse.

4 Two triangles are similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily
   the same size. The corresponding angles are equal, and the corresponding
   sides are proportional.

                                     Similar Triangles.

            Two triangles are similar if either
    5 1 their corresponding angles are equal, or

            2 their corresponding sides are proportional.

    6 If two right triangles have one pair of corresponding acute angles with
       the same measure, then the triangles are similar.

5. Delbert and Francine want to measure the distance across a stream. They
      mark point A directly across the stream from a tree at point T on the
      opposite bank. Delbert walks from point A down the bank a short distance
      to point B and sights the tree. He measures the angle between his line of
      sight and the streambank.

           a Draw a figure showing the stream, the tree, and right triangle ABT .

           b Meanwhile Francine, who was still standing at point A, walks away
              from the stream at right-angles to Delbert's path. Delbert watches
              her progress, and tells her to stop at point C when the angle between
              the stream bank and his line of sight to Francine is the same as the
              angle from the stream bank to the tree. Add triangle ABC to your
              figure.

           c Delbert now measures the distance from point A to Francine at point
              C. Explain why this distance is the same as the distance across the
              stream.

6. If you have a baseball cap, here is another way to measure the distance
      across a river. Stand at point A directly across the river from a convenient
      landmark, say a large rock, on the other side. Tilt your head down so that
      the brim of the cap points directly at the base of the rock, R.

    a Draw a figure showing the river, the rock, and right triangle ABR,
      where B is the location of your baseball cap on your head.

    b Now, without changing the angle of your head, rotate 90 and sight
       along the bank on your side of the river. Have a friend mark the spot
       C on the ground where the brim of your cap points. Add triangle
       ABC to your figure.

    c Finally, you can measure the distance from point A to point C.
      Explain why this distance is the same as the distance across the
      river.

      Two observers on the shore at points A and B would sight the ship
      and measure the angles formed, as shown in figure (a). They would
      then construct a similar triangle as shown in figure (b), with the same
      angles at A and B , and measure its sides. (This method is called
      triangulation.) Use the lengths given in the figures to find the distance
      from observer to the ship.

The Distance Formula

Delbert is hiking in the Santa Monica mountains, and he would like to know
the distance from the Sycamore Canyon trail head, located at 12-C on his map,
to the Coyote Trail junction, located at 8-F, as shown below.
CHAPTER 1. TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES                                           26

    Each interval on the map represents one kilometer. Delbert remembers the
Pythagorean theorem, and uses the map coordinates to label the sides of a
right triangle. The distance he wants is the hypotenuse of the triangle, so

                   d2 = 42 + 32 = 16 + 9 = 25
                         

                    d = 25 = 5

The straight-line distance to Coyote junction is about 5 kilometers.

The formula for the distance between two points is obtained in the same

way.

We first label a right triangle with points P1 and  y

P2 on opposite ends of the hypotenuse. (See the             P2(x2, y2)
figure at right.) The sides of the triangle have
lengths |x2 - x1| and |y2 - y1|. We can use the                   d          y2 -y1
Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance                              P3(x2, y1)
between P1 and P2:                                  P1(x1, y1)
                                                                   x2 -x1     x
            d2 = (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2

Taking the (positive) square root of each side of this equation gives us the

distance formula.

                   Distance Formula.

      The distance d between two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) is

                   d = (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2

We substitute (2, -1) for (x1, y1) and (4, 3) for                     y
(x2, y2) in the distance formula to obtain                           5

                                                                                          5

                                                                                                                                -5

                                                                           
    The exact value of the distance, shown at right, is 2 5 units. We obtain

the same answer if we use (4, 3) for P1 and (2, -1) for P2:

                                     d = (2 - 4)2 + [(-1) - 3]2
                                                    
                                          
                                     = 4 + 16 = 20 = 2 5

We can use a calculator to obtain an approximation for this value, and find

Equation for a Circle

A circle is the set of all points in a plane that lie at a given distance, called the
radius, from a fixed point called the center. We can use the distance formula
to find an equation for a circle.

    The circle shown below has its center at the origin, (0, 0), and its radius is
r.
CHAPTER 1. TRIANGLES AND CIRCLES                                                      28

Now, the distance from the origin to any point  y
P (x, y) on the circle is r. Therefore,                 P (x, y)

                 (x - 0)2 + (y - 0)2 = r             r
                                                                   x
or, squaring both sides,
               (x - 0)2 + (y - 0)2 = r2

    Because every point on the circle must satisfy this equation, we have found
an equation for the circle.

    Because the fraction bar denotes division, a fraction is a quotient of two
integers, and we can calculate its decimal form by dividing the denominator
into the numerator.

Definition 1.37 Rational Number. Any number (including fractions) that

The decimal form of a rational number is either a terminating decimal,

such as 0.75, or a repeating decimal, such as 0.45. Thus, we can always

write down an exact decimal equivalent for a rational number, although we

may choose to round off a particularly long or unwieldy decimal. For example,

an irrational number is nonterminating and nonrepeating. The first few digits
of the examples mentioned are

                                     
                                        3 = 1.732050807568...

                                  3 586 = 8.368209391204...

                   = 3.141592653589...

    but none of these decimal forms ever ends. Thus, we cannot write down an
exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number. The best we can do is give a
decimal approximation, no matter how many digits we include.

Example 1.40 Which values are exact, and which are approximations?

    7                          
a  0.21875                  c 0.16  0.4

   32                          
                            d  1.570796327
b 8  2.828427125
                               2

Solution.

                    7
    a Because is a rational number, it has an exact decimal equivalent.

                    32
                                            7

       Divide 7 by 32 to see that = 0.21875.
                                           32
                                                     

    b Because 8 is not a perfect square, 8 is irrational, so 2.828427125 is not
       the exact value of 8.

          16 4
c 0.16 =       = = 0.4, so this value is exact.

          100 10

               
d Because is an irrational number, it has no decimal equivalent, so

               2
   1.570796327 is an approximation.

Circumference and Area

Recall from geometry that the circumference of a circle is proportional to its
radius.

                               Circumference of a Circle.
         The circumference of a circle of radius r is given by

                                             C = 2r

    The number  gives the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its
diameter. It is an irrational number,   3.14159.

    The length of a portion, or arc, of a circle, is called its arclength.

Example 1.42 Francine baked an apple pie with diameter 8 inches. If Delbert
cuts himself a 60° wedge, what is the arclength of the curved edge?

Solution. The radius of the pie is 4 inches, so its circumference is 2(4)
inches.

                                           1                       60
A 60° wedge, shown at right, is of the entire pie, so                 4 in.

                                           6
              1
its edge is of the circumference. The exact length of
              6
the arc is thus

              1     4
                 (8) = inches.
              6           3

                                                4
    Using a calculator, we find that = 4.19 rounded to two decimal places,

                                                 3
so the length of the curved edge is between 4 and 4 12 inches.

Checkpoint 1.43 What is the arclength of the curved edge of a 60° wedge cut

from a blueberry pie of diameter 10 inches?

Answer.  5   5.24 inches

The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius.

                             Area of a Circle.
The area of a circle of radius r is given by

                             A = r2

A portion of a circle shaped like a pie-shaped wedge is called a sector.

Example 1.44 What is the area of Delbert's slice of apple pie in the previous
example?

                                                                                                     1
Solution. As we saw in the previous example, Delbert's sector of the pie is

                                                                                                     6
                                     1
of the entire pie, so its area of the area of the whole pie, or
                                     6

                 1 (42) = 8 square inches
                 6           3

                                 8
The area of the wedge is , or about 8.38 square inches.

                                         Distance Formula.
                The distance d between two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) is

                                   d = (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2

                                                                                  a

1.4 Chapter 1 Summary and Review

Key Concepts

    1 The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180.
    2 A right triangle has one angle of 90.

    3 All of the angles of an equilateral triangle are equal.

    4 The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.

    5 Vertical angles are equal.

    6 If parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the alternate interior
       angles are equal. Corresponding angles are also equal.

    7 Two triangles are congruent if they have exactly the same size and
       shape.

    8 The altitude of an equilateral triangle divides it into two congruent right
       triangles.

    9 In a 30 - 60 - 90 right triangle, the leg opposite the 30 angle is half
       the length of the hypotenuse.

   10 Two triangles are similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily
       the same size. The corresponding angles are equal, and the corresponding
       sides are proportional.

                                          Similar Triangles.

                Two triangles are similar if either
       11 1 their corresponding angles are equal, or

                2 their corresponding sides are proportional.

12 If two right triangles have one pair of corresponding acute angles with
    the same measure, then the triangles are similar.

13
                                      Distance Formula.

             The distance d between two points P1(x1, y1) and P2(x2, y2) is

                                d = (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2

14 Any number that can be written as a quotient of two integers , b = 0, ,

                                                                                    b
    is called a rational number. The decimal form of a rational number is
    either a terminating decimal or a repeating decimal.

15 An irrational number is one that cannot be written as a quotient of two
               a

    integers , b = 0, . We cannot write down an exact decimal equivalent
                b

    for an irrational number.

16 A circle is the set of all points in a plane that lie at a given distance,
    called the radius, from a fixed point called the center.

17
                                               Circle.

             The equation for a circle of radius r centered at the origin is

                                           x2 + y2 = r2

18 The circle x2 + y2 = 1, which is centered at the origin and has radius 1
    unit, is called the unit circle.

19
                                Circumference of a Circle.

             The circumference of a circle of radius r is given by

                                              C = 2r

The Trigonometric Ratios

   · Side and Angle Relationships
   · Right Triangle Trigonometry
   · Solving Right Triangles

    How would you measure the distance to an inaccessible obect, such as a
ship at sea? In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales estimated
the distances to ships at sea using triangulation, a method for calculating
distances by forming triangles. Using trigonometry and the measured length of
just one side, the lengths of the other sides can be calculated.

    Triangulation has been used to compute distances ever since. In the 16th
century mapmakers began to use triangulation to position far-away places
accurately. And as new methods in navigation and astronomy required greater
precision, the idea of a survey using chains of triangles was developed.

    In 1802, the East India Company embarked on the Great Trigonometrical
Survey of India. Its goal was to measure the entire Indian subcontinent with
scientific precision.

                                                  44
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS  45

    The surveyors began by measuring a baseline near Madras. The baseline
was the only distance they measured; all other distances were calculated from
it using measured angles. Each calculated distance became the base side of
another triangle used to calculate the distance to another point, which in turn
started another triangle. Eventually this process formed a chain of triangles
connecting the origin point to other locations.

    Because of the size of the area to be surveyed, the surveyors did not
triangulate the whole of India but instead created what they called a "gridiron"
of triangulation chains running from North to South and East to West. You
can see these chains in the map of the survey.

    The Survey was completed in 1871. Along the way it calculated the height
of the Himalayan giants: Everest, K2, and Kanchenjunga, and provided one of
the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude.

    Triangulation today is used for many purposes, including surveying, naviga-
tion, metrology, astrometry, binocular vision, and location of earthquakes.

2.1 Side and Angle Relationships

Introduction

From geometry we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. Are
there any relationships between the angles of a triangle and its sides?

    First of all, you have probably observed that the longest side in a triangle is
always opposite the largest angle, and the shortest side is opposite the smallest
angle, as illustrated below.

          a 120 b                                 B             16

              c

Note 2.1

It is usual to label the angles of a triangle with capital             B
letters, and the side opposite each angle with the corre-
sponding lower-case letter, as shown at right. We will                        a
                                                                c

                                                                                 C

follow this practice unless indicated otherwise.                          b

Example 2.2 In F GH, F = 48, and G is obtuse. Side f is 6 feet long.
What can you conclude about the other sides?

Solution. Because G is greater than 90, we know that F + G is greater
than 90 + 48 = 138, so F is less than 180 - 138 = 42.

    Thus, H < F < G, and consequently h < f < g.
    We can conclude that h < 6 feet long, and g > 6 feet long.

Checkpoint 2.3 In isosceles triangle  RST , the vertex angle S = 72.
Which side is longer, s or t?

Answer. s is longer

The Triangle Inequality

It is also true that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must
be greater than the third side, or else the two sides will not meet to form a
triangle. This fact is called the triangle inequality.
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                                  49

             Triangle Inequality.

In any triangle, we must have that               p

             p+q > r                                      q

where p, q, and r are the lengths of                r

the sides of the triangle.

    We cannot use the triangle inequality to find the exact lengths of the sides
of a triangle, but when two sides are known, the triangle inequality allows us
to find upper and lower bounds for the length of the third side.

Example 2.4

Two sides of a triangle have lengths 7 inches             x
                                                                 10
and 10 inches, as shown at right. What can

you say about the length of the third side?      7

Solution. We let x represent the length of the third side of the triangle. By
looking at each side in turn, we can apply the triangle inequality three different
ways, to get

                      7 < x + 10, 10 < x + 7, and x < 10 + 7

We solve each of these inequalities to find

                              -3 < x, 3 < x, and x < 17

We already know that x > -3 because x must be positive, but the other two
inequalities do give us new information. The third side must be greater than 3
inches but less than 17 inches long.

Checkpoint 2.5 Can you make a triangle with three wooden sticks of lengths
14 feet, 26 feet, and 10 feet? Sketch a picture, and explain why or why not.
Answer. No, 10 + 14 is not greater than 26.

Right Triangles: The Pythagorean Theorem

In Chapter 1 we used the Pythagorean theorem to derive the distance formula.
We can also use the Pythagorean theorem to find one side of a right triangle if
we know the other two sides.

             Pythagorean Theorem.

In a right triangle, if c stands for the length        cb
of the hypotenuse, and the lengths of the
two legs are denoted by a and b, then

             a2 + b2 = c2                              a

Example 2.6 A 25-foot ladder is placed against a wall so that its foot is 7 feet
from the base of the wall. How far up the wall does the ladder reach?

Solution. We make a sketch of the situation, as shown below, and label any
known dimensions. We'll call the unknown height h.
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                                 50

The ladder forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so we  h 25
can apply the Pythagorean theorem, substituting 25 for c,        7
7 for b, and h for a.

                              a2 + b2 = c2
                             h2 + 72 = 252

Now solve by extraction of roots:

h2 + 49 = 625      Subtract 49 from both sides.
      h2 = 576     Extract roots.
                   Simplify the radical.
        h = ± 576
        h = ±24

The height must be a positive number, so the solution -24 does not make sense
for this problem. The ladder reaches 24 feet up the wall.

Checkpoint 2.7 A baseball diamond is a square whose sides are 90 feet long.
The catcher at home plate sees a runner on first trying to steal second base,
and throws the ball to the second-baseman. Find the straight-line distance
from home plate to second base.

                  
Answer. 90 2  127.3 feet

Note 2.8 Keep in mind that the Pythagorean theorem is true only for right
triangles, so the converse of the theorem is also true. In other words, if the
sides of a triangle satisfy the relationship a2 + b2 = c2, then the triangle must
be a right triangle. We can use this fact to test whether or not a given triangle
has a right angle.

Example 2.9 Delbert is paving a patio in his back yard, and would like to
know if the corner at C is a right angle.

He measures 20 cm along one side from the             P     52 cm
corner, and 48 cm along the other side, placing  20 cm
pegs P and Q at each position, as shown at                  48 cm   Q
right. The line joining those two pegs is 52 cm       C
long. Is the corner a right angle?

Solution. If is a right triangle, then its sides must satisfy p2 + q2 = c2. We
find

                        p2 + q2 = 202 + 482 = 400 + 2304 = 2704
                               c2 = 522 = 2704

Yes, because p2 + q2 = c2, the corner at C is a right angle.

Checkpoint 2.10 The sides of a triangle measure 15 inches, 25 inches, and 30
inches long. Is the triangle a right triangle?

Answer. No
    The Pythagorean theorem relates the sides of right triangles. However, for

information about the sides of other triangles, the best we can do (without
trigonometry!) is the triangle inequality. Nor does the Pythagorean theorem
help us find the angles in a triangle. In the next section we discover relationships
between the angles and the sides of a right triangle.

2.2 Right Triangle Trigonometry

With the Pythagorean theorem we can find one side of a right triangle if we
know the other two sides. By using what we know about similar triangles, we
can find the unknown sides of a right triangle if we know only one side and one
of the acute angles.

We can find side b with the Pythagorean theorem.           Can we find side b?

The Sine of an Angle

In Example 2 of Section 1.2, we saw that in a

30-60-90 right triangle, the ratio of the shortest             6
side to the hypotenuse was 12 , or 0.5. This ratio
is the same for any two right triangles with a             4                           3
30 angle, because they are similar triangles, as
                                                                    2
shown at right.
                                                           30

The ratio is given a name; it is called the "sine of 30." We write

                      sin(30) = 0.5,

where sin is an abbreviation for sine. There is nothing special about 30 angles;
we can talk about the sine of any angle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of
the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                                                   56

Note 2.11 Recall that we use the notation f (x) to indicate a function of an
input variable, x. In fact, the sine ratio is a function of the angle, so we use
parentheses around the angle input to refer to its sine, like this: sin().

a The side opposite angle  is 5, and the hypotenuse is 13, so the sine of 

is

Using a Calculator

Mathematicians have calculated the sines of any angle we like. The values of
the sine were originally collected into tables, and are now available on scientific
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                             57

calculators. For example, let's find the sine of 50. First, consider some triangles,
as shown below.

                                                            18
                 18

                 30                          50

                      Which angle has the larger sine, 30 or 50?

    Do you expect the sine of 50 to be larger or smaller than the sine of 30?
Do you expect the sine of 50 to be larger or smaller than 1?

Example 2.16 Use your calculator to find the sine of 50 by entering SIN
(50). (Make sure your calculator is set for degrees.) You should find that

                     sin(50) = 0.7660444431

This is not an exact value; the sine of 50 is an irrational number, and your

calculator shows as many digits as its display will allow. (Not all sine values

are as "nice" as the sine of 30!) Usually we round to four decimal places, so

we write

                     sin(50) = 0.7660

Caution 2.17 Note that when you press the sine key, SIN , your calculator
displays

                                        sin (

with an open parenthesis, as the prompt to enter an angle, because the sine is
a function of the angle.

    You can think of the notation sin as an operation symbol telling you to find
the sine of an angle, just as the symbol  tells you to take the square root of
the expression under the radical.

Checkpoint 2.18

b What do you notice about the values of sin() as  increases from 0 to
   90? If you plot the values of sin() against the values of , will the graph

   be a straight line? Why or why not?

Answer.

    a  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0 90

                   sin() 0 0.1737 0.3420 0.5 0.6428 0.7660 0.8660 0.9397 0.9848 1

    b The values of sin() increase from 0 to 1 as  increases from 0 to 90.
       The graph will not be a straight line because the slopes between successive
       points are not constant.

Note 2.19 The important thing to remember is that the sine of an angle, say
50, is the same for any right triangle with a 50 angle, no matter what the
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                        58

size or orientation of the triangle.
    The figure below shows three different right triangles with a 50 angle.
                                                                                          opposite

Although the sides of the triangle may be bigger or smaller, the ratio
                                                                                        hypotenuse

is always the same for that angle, because the triangles are similar. This is why

the sine ratio is useful.

                                        50
                                                                               50

                       50
          In each triangle, the ratio sin(50) = opposite = 0.7660

                                                              hypotenuse

Using the Sine Ratio to Find an Unknown Side

In the next example we see how to use the sine ratio to find an unknown side
in a right triangle, knowing only one other side and one angle.
Example 2.20

Find the length of the side opposite the 50       18 cm x
angle in the triangle shown.

                                                  50

Solution. In this triangle, the ratio opposite is equal to the sine of 50, or
                                                 hypotenuse

                        sin(50) = opposite
                                      hypotenuse

We use a calculator to find an approximate value for the sine of 50, filling in
the lengths of the hypotenuse and the opposite side to get

                                     x
                        0.7660 =

                                    18

We solve for x to find

                        x = 18(0.7660) = 13.788

To two decimal places, the length of the opposite side is 13.79 centimeters.

Caution 2.21 In the previous example, even though we showed only four
places in sin(50), you should not round off intermediate steps in a calculation,
because the answer loses accuracy with each rounding. You can use the following
keystrokes on your calculator to avoid entering a long approximation for sin(50):

                        sin (50) × 18

The calculator returns x = 13.78879998.

The Cosine and the Tangent

There are two more trigonometric ratios used for calculating the sides of right
triangles, depending on which of the three sides is known and which are unknown.
These ratios are called the cosine and the tangent.

    Suppose we'd like to find the height of a tall cliff without actually climbing
it. We can measure the distance to the base of the cliff, and we can use a
surveying tool called a theodolite to measure the angle between the ground and
our line of sight to the top of the cliff (this is called the angle of elevation).

These values give us two parts of a right triangle,                          cliff
as shown at right. The height we want is the side    angle of elevation
opposite the angle of elevation. The distance
to the base of the cliff is the length of the side
adjacent to the angle of elevation.

    The ratio of the side opposite an angle to the side adjacent to the angle is
called the tangent of the angle. The abbreviation for "tangent of theta" is tan
().

Definition 2.23 Tangent of an Acute Angle.

            opposite                                            opposite
tan() =
                                                     
            adjacent                                  adjacent

                                                                                                     
    Just like the sine of an angle, the tangent ratio is always the same for a
given angle, no matter what size triangle it occurs in. And just like sin(), we
can find the values of tan() on a scientific calculator.

Example 2.24

a Use your calculator to find the tangent of 58.

b Find the height of the cliff if the angle of elevation to the top of the cliff
   is 58 at a distance of 300 feet from the base of the cliff.

Solution.

    a Enter TAN (58) to find tan(58) = 1.6003, rounded to four decimal places.

       We use the tangent ratio to write an equation.
       In this triangle, the angle is 58.
    b tan(58) = opposite

                                      adjacent
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                                  60

Next we fill in the value of tan(58), and the lengths of the sides.

                                            h
                              1.6003 =

                                          300

Solving for h gives

                              h = 300(1, 6003) = 480.0

so the height of the cliff is about 480 feet.

                                                   50 ft

b Use the sine ratio to find the hypotenuse, c, of the triangle.

c Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the triangle. Do
  you get the same answer with both methods? Can you explain why the
  calculations might give (slightly) different answers?

Answer.

    a x = 23 ft

    b c = 55 ft

    c The answers agree when rounded to units. Rounding during calculation
       can cause the results to differ.

    The third trigonometric ratio, called the cosine, is the ratio of the side
adjacent to an angle and the hypotenuse of the triangle.

                                                                  8 in

Find sin(), cos(), and tan() for the tri-      6 in
angle shown at right.                                 

Solution. First, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, c.

c2 = 62 + 82                               Take square roots.
c2 = 536 = 84 = 100
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                                     61

       
  c = 100 = 10

For the angle , the opposite side is 8 inches long, and the adjacent side is 6
inches long, as shown in the figure. Thus,

       sin() =  opposite 8
                                   = or 0.8
                hypotenuse 10

2 What do you notice about the values of sine and cosine? Can you explain
  why this is true? (Hint: If one (non-right) angle of a right triangle
   measures x degrees, how big is the other angle?)

    3 Sketch a right triangle and label the opposite and adjacent sides for each
       (non-right) angle.

Note 2.28 In the Activity, you should also notice that as the angle  increases,
sin() increases but cos() decreases.

    You can see why this is true in the figure below. In each right triangle, the
hypotenuse has the same length. But as the angle increases, the opposite side
gets longer and the adjacent side gets shorter.

The Three Trigonometric Ratios

Here is a summary of the three trigonometric ratios we have discussed.
                                   Trigonometric Ratios.

         If  is one of the angles in a right triangle,
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                                        62

                         opposite  hypotenuse              opposite
           sin() =
                                          
                       hypotenuse          adjacent
                         adjacent

           cos() =
                       hypotenuse
                       opposite

           tan() =
                       adjacent

    These three definitions are the foundation for all the rest of trigonometry.
You should internalize them immediately!!

    We must also be careful to apply these definitions of the trigonometric
ratios only to right triangles. In the next example, we create a right triangle
by drawing an extra line.

Example 2.29 The vertex angle of an isosceles triangle is 34, and the equal
sides are 16 meters long. Find the altitude of the triangle.

Solution.

The triangle described is not a right triangle. However,   16 m 17 16 m
the altitude of an isosceles triangle bisects the vertex            h
angle and divides the triangle into two congruent right
triangles, as shown in the figure. The 16-meter side
becomes the hypotenuse of the right triangle, and the
altitude, h, of original triangle is the side adjacent to
the 17 angle.

Which of the three trig ratios is helpful in this problem? The cosine is the

ratio that relates the hypotenuse and the adjacent side, so we'll begin with the

equation

                            cos(17) = adjacent
                                           hypotenuse

We use a calculator to find cos(17) and fill in the lengths of the sides.

                                             h
                                0.9563 =

                                            16

Solving for h gives

                            h = 16(0.9563) = 15.3008

The altitude of the triangle is about 15.3 meters long.

2.3 Solving Right Triangles

Introduction

A triangle has six parts: three sides and three angles. In a right triangle, we
know that one of the angles is 90. If we know three parts of a right triangle,
including one of the sides, we can use trigonometry to find all the other unknown
parts. This is called solving the triangle.

Example 2.31
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                       71

A 10 foot ladder is leaning againt a wall. If      10 ft
the base of the ladder is too far from the wall,
the base can slide out. If the ladder base is too
close to the wall, there's a risk that the ladder
could tip over backwards. For safety reasons,
the leaning ladder should make a 75 angle with
the ground.

a How far should the base of the ladder be
   from the wall?

b How far up the wall will the top of the          75

ladder reach?

Solution.

1. The distance between the base of the ladder and the wall is the side
   adjacent to the 75 angle. We can find the side adjacent to the 75 angle

   angle by using the cosine ratio.

               cos(75) = adjacent
                              hypotenuse
                               b

                 0.2588 =
                              10

                        b = 10(0.2588) = 2.588

   The base of the ladder should be about 2.6 feet from the wall.

2. To find side how far up the wall the ladder will reach, we could use the
   Pythagorean theorem now, but it is better to use given information, rather
   than values we have calculated, to find the other unknown parts. We will
   use the sine ratio.

                                sin(75) = opposite
                                              hypotenuse
                                               a

                                  0.9659 =
                                              10

                                         b = 10(0.9659) = 9.659

The ladder will reach about 9.7 feet.

Checkpoint 2.32 Sketch a right triangle with

   · one angle of 37,

   · the side adjacent to that angle of length 5 centimeters.

Without doing the calculations, list the steps you would use to solve the triangle.
Answer. Use tan (37) to find the opposite side. Use cos (37) to find the
hypotenuse. Subtract 37 from 90 to find the third angle.

Finding an Angle

While watching her niece at the playground, Francine wonders how steep the
slide is. She happens to have a tape measure and her calculator with her, and
finds that the slide is 77 inches high and covers a horizontal distance of 136
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                                                      72
inches, as shown below.
                                                                        77 in
                                               77 in

                 136 in                              136 in

    Francine knows that one way to describe the steepness of an incline is to
calculate its slope, which in this case is

                                      y 77
                                           = = 0.5662

                                      x 136

However, Francine would really like to know what angle the slide makes with
the horizontal. She realizes that the slope she has just calculated is also the
tangent of the angle she wants.

    If we know the tangent of an angle, can we find the angle? Yes, we can:
locate the key labeled tan-1 on your calculator; it is probably the second
function above the TAN key. Enter

                       2nd TAN 0.5662
    and you should find that

                             tan-1(0.5662) = 29.52.

 This means that 29.52 is the angle whose tangent is 0.5662. We read the
notation as "inverse tangent of 0.5662 is 29.52 degrees."

    When we find tan-1 of a number, we are finding an angle whose tangent
is that number. Similarly, sin-1 and cos-1 are read as "inverse sine" and
"inverse cosine." They find an angle with the given sine or cosine.

Example 2.33 Find the angle whose sine is 0.6834.

Solution. Enter 2nd SIN 0.6834 into your calculator to find

                                 sin-1(0.6834) = 43.11

So 43.11 is the angle whose sine is 0.6834. Or we can say that
                                      sin(43.11) = 0.6834

You can check the last equation on your calculator.
Note 2.34 In the last example, the two equations

              sin(43.11) = 0.6834 and sin-1(0.6834) = 43.11

say the same thing in different ways.

Caution 2.35 The notation sin-1(x) does not mean                1
                                                                     . It is true that we
                                                                sin(x)

use negative exponents to indicate reciprocals of numbers, for example a-1 = 1

Checkpoint 2.36 Write the following fact in two different ways: 68 is the
angle whose cosine is 0.3746.
Answer. cos(68) = 0.3746 or cos-1(0.3746) = 68

Example 2.37 Find the angle of inclination of a hill if you gain 400 feet in
elevation while traveling half a mile.

Solution. A sketch of the hill is shown at right. (Recall that 1 mile = 5280
feet.)

sin() =     400   = 0.15                                2640
                                                                               400

 = sin-1(0.15) = 8.71

The angle of inclination of the hill is about 8.7.

Checkpoint 2.38

The tallest living tree is a coast redwood named
Hyperion, at 378.1 feet tall. If you stand 100
feet from the base of the tree, what is the angle
of elevation of your line of sight to the top of the
tree? Round your answer to the nearest degree.

Answer. 75

The Special Angles

The trigonometric ratios for most angles are irrational numbers, but there are

a few angles whose trig ratios are "nice" values. You already know one of these
values: the sine of 30. Because the sides of a right triangle are related by the

Pythagorean theorem, if we know any one of the trig ratios for an angle, we

can find the others.
    Recall that the side opposite a 30 angle is half the length of the hypotenuse,

so sin(30) = 1 .
                  2

The figure at right shows a 30-60-90 triangle with hy-     30 2
potenuse of length 2. The opposite side has length 1,   b
and we can calculate the length of the adjacent side.

                      12 + b2 = 22

                  b2 = 22 - 12 = 3                      60
                    
                  b= 3                                  1

Now we know the cosine and tangent of 30.

                                            opposite 1
cos(30) = adjacent = 3              tan(30 ) =          =

               hypotenuse 2

These are exact values for the trig ratios, but we can also find decimal
CHAPTER 2. THE TRIGONOMETRIC RATIOS                                     74

approximations. Use your calculator to verify the following approximate values.

          exact value                        approximation
                                              0.8660
                                              0.5774

               1
tan(30 ) = 
                               3

Caution 2.39 It is important for you to understand the difference between
exact and approximate values. These decimal approximations, like nearly all
the other trig values your calculator gives you, are rounded off. Even if your
calculator shows you ten or twelve digits, the values are not exactly correct --
although they are quite adequate for most practical calculations!

    The angles 30, 60, and 45 are "special" because we can easily find exact
values for their trig ratios, and use those exact values to find exact lengths for
the sides of triangles with those angles.

Example 2.40 Matterhorn Chocolate bars are sold in boxes shaped like
triangular prisms. The two triangular ends of a box are equilateral triangles
with 8 centimeter sides. When stacking the boxes on a shelf, the second level
will be a triangle's altitude above bottom level. Find the exact length of the
triangle's altitude, h.

Solution.

The altitude divides the triangle into two 30-60-90               8
right triangles as shown in the figure. The altitude        h
is adjacent to the 30 angle, and the hypotenuse of
the right triangle is 8 centimeters. Thus,                     60

cos (30) = adjacent                          Fill in the values.
     hypotenuse                              Multiply both sides by 8.

  =
2 8
            3                     
  h=8                          =4 3
         2

                      
The altitude is 4 3 centimeters long, which is approximately 6.9 cm.

    From this exact answer, wecan find approximations to any degree of accuracy
we like. You can check that 4 3  6.9282, so the altitude is approximately 6.9
centimeters long.

Checkpoint 2.41 Use the figure in the previous example to find exact values

for the sine, cosine, and tangent of 60.
         
Answer. sin(60) = 3 , cos(60) = 1 ,          tan(60) = 3
         2                                2

There is one more special angle: 45. We find the trig ratios for this angle

using an isosceles right triangle. Because the base angles of an isosceles triangle

are equal, they must both be 45.

    The figure shows an isosceles right triangle with equal sides of length 1. You
can use the Pythagorean theorem to show that the hypotenuse has length 2,

so the trig ratios for 45 are

You should be familiar with the exact values for these trig ratios. A good way
to remember them is to know the two special triangles shown below. From
these triangles, you can always write down the three trig ratios for the special
angles.

                                                                   60

You should also be able to recognize their decimal approximations.

Note 2.42 We can use the special angles as benchmarks for estimating and
mental calculation. For example, we know that sin (60)  0.8660, so if sin
() = 0.95 for some unknown angle , we know that  > 60, because as 

increases from the sine of  increases also.

                                     
                                        3

Example 2.43 If cos() > , what can we say about ?
                                      2

Solution. As an angle increases from 0 to 90, its cosine decreases.          Now,

cos(30) = 3 , so if cos() > 3 , then  must be less than 30.

Concepts

1 If we know one of the sides of a right triangle and any one of the other
   four parts, we can use trigonometry to find all the other unknown parts.

2 If we know one of the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle, we can find
   the angle using the inverse trig key on a calculator.

3 The exact values of trigonometric ratios of the special angles should be
   memorized.

2.4 Chapter 2 Summary and Review

Key Concepts

    1 The longest side in a triangle is opposite the largest angle, and the shortest
       side is opposite the smallest angle

    2 Triangle Inequality: In any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two
       sides is greater than the length of the third side.

    3 Pythagorean Theorem: In a right triangle with hypotenuse c, a2 +
       b2 = c2.

    4 If the sides of a triangle satisfy the relationship a2 + b2 = c2, then the
       triangle is a right triangle.

    5 By using similar triangles, we can find the unknown sides of a right
       triangle if we know only one side and one of the acute angles.

                tan() =
                            adjacent

7 The trigonometric ratio of an angle  is the same for every right triangle
   containing the angle.

8 If we know one of the sides of a right triangle and any one of the other
   four parts, we can use trigonometry to find all the other unknown parts.

9 If we know one of the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle, we can find
   the angle using the inverse trig key on a calculator.

10 The exact values of trigonometric ratios of the special angles are useful
    benchmarks.

Laws of Sines and Cosines

   · Obtuse Angles
   · The Law of Sines
   · The Law of Cosines

    The first science developed by humans is probably astronomy. Before the
invention of clocks and calendars, early people looked to the night sky to help
them keep track of time. What is the best time to plant crops, and when will
they ripen? On what day exactly do important religious festivals fall?

    By tracking the motions of the stars, early astronomers could identify the
summer and winter solstices and the equinoxes. The rising and setting of certain
stars marked the hours of the night.

    If we think of the stars as traveling on a dome above the Earth, we create
the celestial sphere. Actually, of course, the Earth itself rotates among the
stars, but for calculating the motions of heavenly objects, this model works
very well.

    Babylonian astronomers kept detailed records on the motion of the planets,
and were able to predict solar and lunar eclipses. All of this required familiarity
with angular distances measured on the celestial sphere.

    To find angles and distances on this imaginary sphere, astronomers invented

                                                  88

techniques that are now part of spherical trigonometry. The laws of sines
and cosines were first stated in this context, in a slightly different form than
the laws for plane trigonometry.

    On a sphere, a great-circle lies in a plane passing through the sphere's
center. It gives the shortest distance between any two points on a sphere, and
is the analogue of a straight line on a plane. A spherical angle is formed where
two such arcs intersect, and a spherical triangle is made up of three arcs of
great circles.

    The spherical law of sines was first introduced in Europe in 1464 by Johann
Müller, also known as Regiomontanus, who wrote:

    "You, who wish to study great and wondrous things, who wonder about the
movement of the stars, must read these theorems about triangles. ... For no
one can bypass the science of triangles and reach a satisfying knowledge of the
stars."

3.1 Obtuse Angles

The town of Avery lies 48 miles due east of Baker, and Clio is 34 miles from
Baker, in the direction 35 west of north. How far is it from Avery to Clio?

We know how to solve right triangles using               North
the trigonometric ratios. But the triangle
formed by the three towns is not a right          C
triangle, because it includes an obtuse angle
of 125 at B, as shown in the figure.                     35     ?

                                                  34 mi

                                                                   A

    A triangle that is not a right triangle is called an oblique triangle. In this
chapter we learn how to solve oblique triangles using the laws of sines and
cosines. But first we must be able to find the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios
for obtuse angles.

Angles in Standard Position

To extend our definition of the trigonometric ratios to obtuse angles, we use
a Cartesian coordinate system. We put an angle  in standard position as
follows:

   · Place the vertex at the origin with the initial side on the positive x-axis;

   · the terminal side opens in the counter-clockwise direction.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                      90

· We choose a point P on the terminal side of the angle, and form a right
   triangle by drawing a vertical line from P to the x-axis.

    The length of the side adjacent to  is the x-coordinate of point P , and
the length of the side opposite is the y-coordinate of P . The length of the
hypotenuse is the distance from the origin to P , which we call r. With this
notation, our definitions of the trigonometric ratios are as follows.

Coordinate Definitions of the Trigonometric Ratios.

                x                      P (x, y)
· cos() =
                                 ry
                r
               y         
· sin() =                        x
               r
                y
· tan() =
                x

It doesn't matter which point P on the termi-        P (x, y)       P (x , y )
nal side we use to calculate the trig ratios. If                    y
we choose some other point, say P , with coor-                  y   Q
dinates (x , y ), as shown at right, we will get     x Q
the same values for the sine, cosine and tan-
gent of . The new triangle formed is similar                     x
to the first one, so the ratios of the sides of the
new triangle are equal to the corresponding O
ratios in the first triangle.

Example 3.1 Find the values of cos (), sin (), and tan () if the point (12, 5)
is on the terminal side of .

Solution. For the point P (12, 5), we have x = 12 and y = 5. We use the
distance formula to find r.

                     r = (2 - 0)2 + (5 - 0)2
                       
                     
                     = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13

The trig ratios are

            x 12                                           r  (12, 5)
cos() = =                                                              y
                                                     
            r 13                                          12
            y5
sin() = =
            r 13
            y5
tan() = =
            x 12

Note 3.2 In the previous Example, we get the same results by using the triangle
definitions of the trig ratios. We create a right triangle by dropping a vertical
line from P to the x-axis, as shown in the figure. The legs of the right triangle
have lengths 12 and 5, and the hypotenuse has length 13.

Trigonometric Ratios for Obtuse Angles

Our new definitions for the trig ratios work just as well for obtuse angles, even
though  is not technically "inside" a triangle, because we use the coordinates
of P instead of the sides of a triangle to compute the ratios.

    Notice first of all that because x-coordinates are negative in the second
quadrant, the cosine and tangent ratios are both negative for obtuse angles.
For example, in the figure below, the point (-4, 3) lies on the terminal side of
the angle . We see that r = (-4)2 + 32 = 5 , so

                     x -4           P (-4, 3)
         cos() = =

                  3

Solution. Because  is obtuse, the terminal side of the angle lies in the second
                                                                                1

                                                                                3

y1
   = , so we can choose a point P with y = 1 and r = 3. To find cos () and

r3
tan () we need to know the value of x. From the Pythagorean Theorem,

         x2 + 12 = 32               (x, 1)
               x2 = 32 - 12 = 8  13 
                         
                x=- 8

Remember that x is negative in the second quadrant! Thus

                                                                   y -1

Using a Calculator

In the Examples above, we used a point on the terminal side to find exact
values for the trigonometric ratios of obtuse angles. Scientific and graphing
calculators are programmed with approximations for these trig ratios.

Example 3.6 Find the sine and cosine of 130. Compare to the sine and cosine
of 50.

Solution. Using a calculator and rounding the values to four places, we find

                   sin(130) = 0.7660 and cos(130) = -0.6428

                   sin(50) = 0.7660 and    cos(50) = 0.6428

    We see that sin(130) = sin(50) and cos(130) = - cos(50). This result
should not be surprising when we look at both angles in standard position, as
shown below.

                                           (-x, y)              (x, y)

The angles 50 and 130 are supple-                   r        r
mentary. The right triangles formed by
choosing the points (x, y) and (-x, y)                  130
on their terminal sides are congruent
triangles.                                              50

    Consequently, the trigonometric ratios for 50 and for 130 are equal, except
that the cosine of 130 is negative.

Trigonometric Ratios for Supplementary Angles

The Examples above illustrate the following equations for supplementary angles.
These three equations are called identities, which means that they are true
for all values of the variable .

           Trigonometric Ratios for Supplementary Angles.

· cos(180 - ) = - cos                 P (-x, y)                     P (x, y)
· sin(180 - ) = sin 
· tan(180 - ) = - tan                            r 180 -  r
                                                                  

Caution 3.8 Because of these relationships, there are always two (supplemen-
tary) angles between 0 and 180 that have the same sine. Your calculator will
only tell you one of them, so you have to be able to find the other one on your
own! Fortunately, this is not difficult.

Example 3.9 Find two different angles , rounded to the nearest 0.1, that
satisfy sin() = 0.25.

Solution. To find an angle with sin() = 0.25, we calculate  = sin-1(0.25).
With the calculator in degree mode, we press

                       2nd SIN 0.25 ) ENTER
    and find that one angle is   14.5. We draw this acute angle in standard
position in the first quadrant, and sketch in a right triangle as shown below.
There must also be an obtuse angle whose sine is 0.25. To see the second angle,
we draw a congruent triangle in the second quadrant as shown.

           yr                             ry
                             14.5     14.5

    The supplement of 14.5, namely  = 180 - 14.5 = 165.5, is the obtuse
                                             y

angle we need. Because the ratio is the same for both triangles, they have
                                             r

the same sine.
Checkpoint 3.10 Find two different angles  that satisfy sin() = 0.5.
Answer.  = 30,  = 150

    Because there are two angles with the same sine, it is easier to find an
obtuse angle if we know its cosine instead of its sine.

                                                     3

Solution.  Using x = -3 and y = 4, we find
                                                   

                             r = 32 + 42 = 25 = 5

so cos() = x = -3 , and  = cos-1 -3 . We can enter
           r5                      5

                   2nd COS -3 ÷ 5 )   ENTER

we get   53.1.
                                                                                         53.1

    This is the acute angle whose terminal side passes through the point (3, 4),

Supplements of the Special Angles

In Chapter 2 we learned that the angles             120                                  60
30, 45 and 60 are useful because we            135                                            45
can find exact values for their trigono-  150                                                      30
metric ratios. The same is true for the
supplements of these angles in the sec-
ond quadrant, shown at right.

Example 3.14 Find exact values for the trigonometric ratios of 135.

Solution. We sketch an angle of  = 135 in standard position, as shown

below. The terminal side is in the second quadrant and makes an acute angle
of 45 with the negative x-axis, and passes through the point (-1, 1). Thus,
r = (-1)2 + 12 = 2 , and we calculate

    We can also find the trig ratios for the quadrantal angles. These are the
angles, including 0, 90 and 180, whose terminal sides lie on one of the axes.

Example 3.16 Find exact values for the trigonometric ratios of 90.

Solution.                                                  (0, 1)

The terminal side of a 90 angle in standard position is
the positive y-axis. If we take the point P (0, 1) on the
terminal side as shown at right, then x = 0 and y = 1.
Although we don't have a triangle, we can still calculate
a value for r, the distance from the origin to P .

                   r = 02 + 12 = 1
Our coordinate definitions for the trig ratios give us

cos(90) = x = 0 and sin(90) = y = 1
r1                                                         r1

so cos(90) = 0 and sin(90) = 1 . Also, tan(90) = y = 1 , so tan(90) is
                                                                          x0

Answer. cos(180) = -1, sin(180) = 0, tan(180) = 0

The Area of a Triangle

The figure below shows part of the map for a new housing development, Pacific
Shores. You are interested in the corner lot, number 86, and you would like
to know the area of the lot in square feet. The sales representative for Pacific
Shores provides you with the dimensions of the lot, but you don't know a
formula for the area of an irregularly shaped quadrilateral.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                          97

It occurs to you that you can divide the quadrilateral       114.8 ft
into two triangles, and find the area of each. Now,                     86.1

you know a formula for the area of a triangle in                                   161 ft

terms of its base and height, namely,                   120.3 ft  95 86

                 1                                                     141 ft
           A = bh,

                 2

    but unfortunately, you don't know the height of either triangle.
    However, you can easily measure the angles at the corners of the lot using
the plot map and a protractor. You can check the values on the plot map for
lot 86 shown above.
    Using trigonometry, we can find the area of a triangle if we know two of
its sides, say a and b, and the included angle, . The figure below shows three
possibilities, depending on whether the angle  is acute, obtuse, or 90.

           (x, y) (x, y)                       (x, y)

          h

                                                                  
        b
                                            b                       b

    In each case, b is the base of the triangle, and its altitude is h. Our task
is to find an expression for h in terms of the quantities we know: a, b, and .
You should check that in all three triangles

                                   h
                       sin() =

                                   a

Solving for h gives us h = a sin(). Finally, we substitute this expression for h
into our old formula for the area to get

                    1                  1
             A = b h = b a sin()

                  2

Example 3.18 Find the area of lot 86.

Solution. For the triangle in the lower portion of lot 86, a = 120.3, b = 141,
and  = 95. The area of that portion is

                                      1
                   First Area = ab sin()

                                      2
                                  = 1 (120.3)((141) sin(95)  8448.88

                                      2

    For the triangle in the upper portion of the lot, a = 161, b = 114.8, and
 = 86.1. The area of that portion is
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                        98

                                     1
                Second Area = ab sin()

                                     2
                                  = 1 (161)((114.8) sin(86.1)  9220.00

                                     2

    The total area of the lot is the sum of the areas of the triangles

               Total area = First Area + Second Area  17668.88

Lot 86 has an area of approximately 17,669 square feet.

3.2 The Law of Sines

We have learned to use the trigonometric ratios to solve right triangles. But the
trig ratios are only valid for the sides of right triangles. Can we find unknown
sides or angles in an oblique triangle?

            B                                 B
                         c                                   c

            ?                                ?

            C               A             C                        A

We can find a if we know                  Can find a if we know A
A and c (and C = 90).                     and c and C?

    In this section and the next we find relationships among the sides and angles
of oblique triangles. These relationships are called the Law of Sines and the
Law of Cosines. To derive these new rules, we use what we already know about
right triangles.

Note 3.21 Reducing a new problem to an earlier one is a frequently used
technique in mathematics.

    Consider the oblique triangle below. By drawing in the altitude h of the
triangle, we create two right triangles, BCD and ABD, as shown in the
figure. Now we can write expressions in terms of h for sin A and for sin C.

Looking at BCD, we see that

              h                                                 B
                 = sin(C).
                                                a               h     c
              a
Looking at  ABD, we see that

              h                              C                  D        A
                 = sin(A).

               c
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                          107

Now we solve each of these equations for h:

h                  and         h  = sin(A)        Solve each equation for h.
  = sin(C)
                               c
a

      h = a sin(C) and h = c sin(A) Equate the expressions for h.

             a sin(C) = c sin(A)                  Divide both sides by ac.

             sin(C) sin(A)
                   =
             c           a

We have derived a relationship between the angles A and C and their

opposite sides, a and c. If we know any three of these quantities, we can find

the fourth.

In a similar way, by drawing in the altitude from the vertex C, we can show

that                              sin(A) sin(B)

                                  a  =         b

Putting both results together, we have the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines is

true for any triangle, whether it is acute, right, or obtuse.

                                  Law of Sines.

If the angles of a triangle are A, B, and C, and the B

opposite sides are respectively a, b, and c, then       c         a

             sin(A) sin(B) sin(C)                                    C

                      =           =                  A         b

                a           b        c

      or equivalently,

                            a     =  b         =  c

                         sin(A) sin(B) sin(C)

Finding a Side

In the next example, we use the Law of Sines to find a distance.

Example 3.22 Two observers onshore sight a ship at an unknown distance
from the shore. The observers are 400 yards apart at points A and B, and they
each measure the angle from the shoreline to the ship, as shown below. How
far is the ship from the observer at A?

                    B
             400 yd 79.4

                  83.2                                         C
             A
                                            d

Solution. First note that ABC is not a right triangle, so we cannot use

the trig ratios directly to find the sides of this triangle.
    The unknown distance d is the side opposite B = 79.4. In order to use

the Law of Sines, we must know another angle and the side opposite that angle.

We do: we know that side c = 400, and we can compute the angle at the ship,

Now we apply the Law of Sines, using angles B and C.

              b  =      c           Substitute the given values.

Solving Triangles with the Law of Sines

In order to apply the Law of Sines to find a side, we must know one angle of
the triangle and its opposite side (either a and A, or b and B, or c and C), and
one other angle. Then we can find the side opposite that angle.

Example 3.24

In the triangle shown at right,                                          B
             A = 37, B = 54, and a = 11                            54
                                                         c

                                                                         a = 11

a Find b.                                A 37            b          C
b Solve the triangle.

Solution.

a We use the Law of Sines with a and angle A to find b.

                    a      =  b          Substitute the given values.
                                         Multiply both sides by sin(54).
                 sin(A) sin(B)

                    11        b
                 sin(37) = sin(54)

sin(37 11 ) · sin(54) = b

Evaluating this expression with a calculator, we find that b  14.79.

b The angle C = 180 - (37 + 54) = 89. Now we use the Law of Sines to
   find side c. Note that it is safer to use the given side, a, rather than the
   value we calculated for b.

                    a      =  c          Substitute the known values.
                                         Multiply both sides by sin(89).
                 sin(A) sin(C)

                    11        c
                 sin(37) = sin(89)
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                         109

    sin(37 11 ) · sin(89) = c
so c  18.28.

A = 65, C = 42, and c = 16               c = 16 65 b

Answer. B = 73, b = 22.87, a = 21.68

Finding an Angle

We can also use the Law of Sines to find an unknown angle of a triangle. We
must know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of them.

Example 3.26

In the triangle shown at right,               B
       B = 55, a = 5, and b = 11         a = 5 55 c

Solve the triangle.                                                       A
                                                C b = 11

Solution. We must find the three remaining parts of the triangle, A, C, and
c. First, we use the Law of Sines to find sin(A).

sin(A) sin(B)
      =                                  Substitute the known values.
a                    b                   Multiply both sides by 5.

sin(A) sin(55)
      =
5                    11

sin(A) = 5 ·         sin(55)   0.3723

                         11

So A = sin-1(0.3723)  21.9. Now we know two angles, and we can find angle
C.

                         C = 180 - (B + A)
                            = 180 - 55 - 21.9 = 103.1

Finally, we use the Law of Sines to find side c.

   c          =          b               Substitute the known values.

sin(C) sin(B)                             Multiply both sides by
                                          sin(103.1).
c                        11
sin(103.1) = sin(55)

      c = sin(55 11 ) · sin(103.1)

Evaluating this expression with a calculator gives c  13.1.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                     110

Checkpoint 3.27 Sketch a triangle with C = 93, a = 7, and c = 11.
    a Use the Law of Sines to find another angle of the triangle.
    b Solve the triangle, and label your sketch with the results.

Answer.

a A = 39.5                              b b = 8.13, B = 47.5

Caution 3.28 In the last Example we used the value of sin(A) to find angle A.
But there are two angles that satisfy sin(A) = 0.3723, one acute (21.9) and
one obtuse (158.1). How did we know which one to choose?

                     y                  158.1 r
                        0.3723                 21.9

                     ry
                            r

    In this case, the obtuse angle is too big to fit in the triangle, because
angle B = 55. Sometimes both angles will produce (different) triangles, and
sometimes only the acute angle will work. You should always check whether
both angles provide solutions.

Note 3.29 Because there can be more than one solution for a triangle in which
we know two sides and an angle opposite one of them, this situation is called
the ambiguous case for the Law of Sines. (See Homework Problems 33-42
for more about the ambiguous case.)

Example 3.30 Find two triangles in which B = 14.4, a = 8, and b = 3, and
sketch both triangles.

Solution. Using the Law of Sines, we have

sin(A) sin(B)
         =                              Substitute the known values.
a             b                         Multiply both sides by 8.

sin(A) sin(14.4)
         =
8                 3

sin(A) = 8 ·  sin(14.4)   0.6632

                     3

There are two angles with sine 0.6632:

· the acute angle A = sin-1(0.6632) = 41.5,

   · or its supplement, A = 180 - 41.5 = 138.5.

    Each of these angles produces a different solution triangle, because the angle
C and side c will be different also.

   · In the first case, angle C = 180 - (14.4 + 138.5) = 27.1, and we have
       the triangle shown in figure (a).

· In the second case, C = 180 - (14.4 + 41.5) = 124.1, which gives us
   the triangle shown in figure (b).

         138.5 A                                                      A

Applications

In the next example, we use two triangles to solve the problem.

Example 3.32 Richard wants to measure the height of a castle controlled by
hostile forces. When he is as close as he can get to the castle, the angle of
elevation to the top of the wall is 18.5. He then retreats 20 yards and measures
the angle of elevation again; this time it is 15.9. How tall is the castle?

                               A

                                      r
           h

                                18.5                       15.9

           D                                         B 20 yd C

Solution.

                                                  A                r
Notice that h is one side of the right
triangle ADC. If we can find its                           18.5          15.9
hypotenuse, labeled r in the figure, h
we can use the sine ratio to find                                     B 20 yd C
h. To find r, we consider a second
triangle, ABC, as shown below.

                                                  D

    In this triangle, we know side BC = 20 and would like to find side AC = r.
We can use the Law of Sines to find r, but first we must calculate the other
angles of the triangle.

    Now, the angle opposite r, ABC, is the complement of 18.5, so

           ABC = 180 - 18.5 = 161.5
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                       112

The angle opposite the 20-yard side, BAC, is
                         BAC = 180 - (161.5 + 15.9) = 2.6

Now we can apply the Law of Sines to find r. We have

r  20                                 Solve for r.
sin(161.5) = sin(2.6)

   r = sin(161.5) · sin 2.6 20

    139.9

    So r is about 139.9 yards. Finally, using the right triangle ADC and the
definition of sine, we can write

h = sin(15.9)                         Solve for h.
r
h = r · sin(15.9)  38.33

    The castle is about 38.33 yards tall.

Checkpoint 3.33 Solve the problem in the previous example again, but instead
of finding r, find the length AB, and then use ABD to find h.
Answer. AB = 120.79, the castle is about 38.33 yards tall.

Measuring Astronomical Distances

If you look at a nearby object and alternately close your left and right eyes,
the object seems to jump in position. This apparent change occurs because
your eyes are viewing the object from two different positions spaced several
centimeters apart. If the object at point O is straight ahead of one eye, it
appears to be at some angle p away from the line of sight of the other eye. The
angle p is called the parallax of the object.

    Use the figure below to see that p is also the angle between the directions to
your two eyes when viewed from point O. (What fact from geometry justifies
this statement?)

                                                          O
                                                p

                                        p

    Astronomers use parallax to determine the distance from earth to stars and
other celestial objects. Two observers on Earth at a known distance apart both
measure the direction to the star. The difference in angle between those two
directions is the parallax.

Example 3.34 Astronomers 1000 kilometers apart observe an asteroid with a
parallax of 0.001. How far is the asteroid from Earth?

Solution. We let x represent the distance to the asteroid. The asteroid and
the two observers make an isosceles triangle with base 1000 km and equal sides
of length x, as shown below.

                                                                   2

    sin(89.999) = sin(0.001)                             Solve for x.

                     x = sin(89.999) · sin(0.001 1000 )

                     x  57, 000, 000

    The asteroid is about 57 million kilometers from Earth (roughly one third
of the distance to the Sun).

Checkpoint 3.35 Two observers 800 kilometers apart observe an object with
a parallax of 0.0005. How far is the object from Earth?

Answer. About 91,673,247 km

Small Angles: Minutes and Seconds

To obtain the most accurate parallax measurements, the distance between the

two observers should be as large as possible. But even measured from opposite

sides of Earth's orbit, stars outside the solar system have parallaxes much

smaller than 0.0001.

    In order to handle such small angles, we divide degrees into smaller units

                                             1
called minutes and seconds. One minute is of a degree, and 1 second is

and seconds.

    When describing large distances, astronomers sometimes use the distance
from Earth to the Sun, about 93 million miles, as the unit of measurement.
This distance is called 1 Astronomical Unit, or 1 AU. For example, an object
that is three times as far away as the Sun would be at a distance of 3 AU.

Example 3.36 The star Wolf 359 has a parallax of 0.85 when observed from
opposites sides of Earth's orbit. How far away is the star?

Solution. In the figure below, the star Wolf 359 is located at point O. Our
Sun is located at point C, halfway between the two observation points at A
and B. Thus, the distance between the observation points is twice the distance
from the Earth to the Sun, or 2 AU.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                                     114

    The star is approximately 485, 000 AU from Earth, or nearly half a million
times the distance from Earth to the Sun.

Checkpoint 3.37 Two observers are 1 AU (astronomical unit) apart. They
find that the parallax to a distant star is 1 . What is the distance to the star,
in astronomical units?

    (This distance is called a parsec. In other words, a parsec is the distance
at which the parallax from observations 1 AU apart is 1 . In this Exercise, you
are calculating the number of astronomical units in 1 parsec.)

Answer. 1 parsec  206, 265 AU

                                         Law of Sines.

    If the angles of a triangle are A, B, and C, and the opposite
sides are respectively a, b, and c, then

            sin(A) sin(B) sin(C)                              B
               =               =
            a               b         c                       ca

                                                                        C

                                                           A     b

          or equivalently,

                            a  =         b  =           c

                            sin(A) sin(B) sin(C)

2 We can use the Law of Sines to find an unknown side in an oblique triangle.
  We must know the angle opposite the unknown side, and another side-
   angle pair.

3 We can also use the Law of Sines to find an unknown angle of a triangle.
  We must know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of
   them.

4 Remember that there are two angles with a given sine. When using
   the Law of Sines, we must check whether both angles result in possible
   triangles.

5 We use minutes and seconds to measure very small angles.

Study Questions

    1 Can we use the Law of Sines to solve a right triangle?

    2 Explain why we cannot use the Law of Sines to solve the triangle with
       a = 8, b = c and C = 35.

    3 Francine says "I'm thinking of an angle whose sine is 0.3420 (rounded to
       four decimal places)." Delbert says "The angle must be 20 (rounded to
       the nearest degree)." Is he correct? Why or why not?

    4 Sketch two possible triangles with A = 25, b = 18, and a = 10.

    5 Try to sketch a triangle with A = 65, b = 18, and a = 10. What went
       wrong?

3.3 The Law of Cosines

If we know two angles and one side of a triangle, we can use the Law of Sines
to solve the triangle. We can also use the Law of Sines when we know two sides
and the angle opposite one of them. But the Law of Sines is not helpful for the
problem that opened this chapter, finding the distance from Avery to Clio. In
this case we know two sides of the triangle, a and c, and the included angle, B.

                                              B

of them. We can use the Law of Sines.   We cannot use the Law of Sines.

    To solve a triangle when we know two sides and the included angle, we will

need a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem known as the Law of Cosines.
    In a right triangle, with C = 90, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that

                             c2 = a2 + b2
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                           122

If we allow angle C to vary, but keep a and b the same length, the side c will
grow or shrink, depending on whether we increase or decrease the angle C, as
shown below.

ac                         ac                                  c
                                                     a

C  b            C          b                            C         b

C = 90                     C is acute                   C is obtuse
c2 = a2 + b2               c2 < a2 + b2                 c2 > a2 + b2

    The Pythagorean theorem is actually a special case of a more general law
that applies to all triangles, no matter what the size of angle C. The equation
relating the three sides of a triangle is

                c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos(C)

You can see that when C is a right angle, cos 90 = 0, so the equation reduces
to the Pythagorean theorem.

    We can write similar equations involving the angles or A or B. The three
equations are all versions of the Law of Cosines.

                                   Law of Cosines.

    If the angles of a triangle are A, B, and C, and the opposite sides
are respectively a, b, and c, then

                a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos(A)
                b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos(B)
                c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos(C)

Note 3.38 For a proof of the Law of Cosines, see Homework Problems 57 and
58.

Finding a Side

Now we can solve the problem of the dis-             North
tance from Avery to Clio. Here is the figure
from Section 3.1 showing the location of the  C
three towns.
                                                     35        ?

                                              34 mi

                                                     B 48 mi             East
                                                                     A

Example 3.39 How far is it from Avery to Clio?
Solution.

The angle ABC = 35 +90 = 125. Thus,                  C
in ABC we have a = 34, c = 48 and
B = 125. The distance from Avery to Clio                34 125

is represented by b in the figure.                          B        48 A

    We know two sides and the included angle, and we choose the version of
the Law of Cosines that uses our known angle, B.

b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos(B)                     Substitute the known values.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                     123

b2 = 342 + 482 - 2(34)(48) cos(125)          Simplify the right side.
b2 = 3460 - 3264 cos(125) = 5332.153         Take square roots.
 b = 73.02

Avery is about 73 miles from Clio.
Caution 3.40 When simplifying the Law of Cosines, be careful to follow the
order of operations. In the previous example, the right side of the equation

                           b2 = 342 + 482 - 2(34)(48) cos(125)

has three terms, and simplifies to

                            b2 = 1156 + 2304 - 3264 cos(125)
                            b2 = 3460 - 3264(-0.573567364...)

Note that 3264 is the coefficient of cos(125), so it would be incorrect to subtract
3264 from 3460. If you are using a graphing calculator, you can enter the right
side of the equation exactly as it is written.

Checkpoint 3.41 In ABC, a = 11, c = 23, and B = 87. Find b, and round
your answer to two decimal places.

Answer. 24.97

Finding an Angle

We can also use the Law of Cosines to find an angle when we know all three
sides of a triangle. Pay close attention to the algebraic steps used to solve the
equation in the next example.

Example 3.42

                                                               C

In the triangle at right, a = 6, b = 7, and     6                  7
c = 11. Find angle C.
                                                                      A
                                             B
                                                               11

Solution. We choose the version of the Law of Cosines that uses angle C.

c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos(C)             Substitute the known values.
                                      Simplify each side.
112 = 62 + 72 - 2(6)(7) cos(C)        Isolate the cosine term.
                                      Solve for cos (C).
121 = 36 + 49 - 84 cos(C)
                                      Solve for C.
36 = -84 cos(C)

-3                    = 115.4
     = cos(C)

 7
 C = cos-1 -3

                   7

Angle C is about 115.4.

Checkpoint 3.43 In ABC, a = 5.3, b = 4.7, and c = 6.1. Find angle B,
and round your answer to two decimal places.
Answer. 48.07

    Once we have calculated one of the angles in a triangle, we can use either
the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines to find a second angle. Here is how we
would use the Law of Sines to find angle A in the previous Example.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                             124

sin(A) sin(C)
   =                               Substitute the known values.
a             c                    Solve for sin A.

sin(A) sin(115.4)
   =
6                11

sin(A) = 6 ·  sin(115.4)   0.4928

                     11

    Thus, A = sin-1(0.4928) = 29.5. (We know that A is an acute angle
because it is opposite the shortest side of the triangle.) Finally,

                         B = 180 - (A + C)  35.1

Alternatively, we can use the Law of Cosines to find angle A.

a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos(A)          Substitute the known values.
                                   Simplify each side.
62 = 72 + 112 - 2(7)(11) cos(A)    Isolate the cosine term.
                                   Solve for cos(A).
36 = 49 + 121 - 154 cos(A)
                                   Solve for A.
-134 = -154 cos(A)

67                       = 29.5
    = cos(A)

77
 A = cos-1 67

                 77

Note 3.44 Using the Law of Sines requires fewer calculations than the Law of
Cosines, but the Law of Cosines uses only the original values, instead of the
results of our previous calculations and approximations.

    Whenever we round off a number, we introduce inaccuracy into the calcula-
tions, and these inaccuracies grow with each additional calculation. Thus, for
the sake of accuracy, it is best to use given values in preference to calculated
values whenever possible.

Using the Law of Cosines for the Ambiguous Case

In Section 3.2 we encountered the ambiguous case:
    If we know two sides a and b of a triangle and the acute angle  opposite

one of them, there may be one solution, two solutions, or no solution, depending
on the size of a in relation to b and , as shown below.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                               125

              The Ambiguous Case.

1 No solution: a < b sin()       3 Two solutions: b sin() <
                                    a<b
               ba
                                                b
                                                     aa
    is too short to make a tri-
   angle.                                        

2 One solution: a = b sin()      4 One solution: a > b

               ba                     b    a
                
                                         
    is exactly the right length
   to make a right triangle.

    If  is an obtuse angle, things are simpler: there is one solution if a > b,
and no solution if a  b.

    Because there are always two angles with a given sine, if we use the Law
of Sines for the ambiguous case, we must check whether both possible angles
result in a triangle. But here is another approach: We can apply the Law of
Cosines to find the third side first. With that method, we'll need the quadratic
formula.

              Quadratic Formula.

The solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0,  a = 0,

are given by                 
                     -b ± b2 - 4ac
              x=

                               2a

    A quadratic equation can have one solution, two solutions, or no solution,
depending on the value of the discriminant, b2 - 4ac. If we use the Law of
Cosines to find a side in the ambiguous case, the quadratic formula will tell us
how many triangles have the given properties.

   · If the quadratic equation has one positive solution, there is one triangle.

   · If the quadratic equation has two positive solutions, there are two triangles.

   · If the quadratic equation has no positive solutions, there is no triangle
       with the given properties.

Example 3.45 In ABC, B = 14.4, a = 8, and b = 3. Solve the triangle.
Solution. We begin by finding the third side of the triangle. Using the Law
of Cosines, we have

b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos(B)       Substitute the known values.
32 = 82 + c2 - 2(8)c cos(14.4)  Simplify.
 9 = 64 + c2 - 16c(0.9686)      Write the quadratic equation in standard form.
 0 = c2 - 15.497c + 55          Apply the quadratic formula.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                     126

        15.497 ± (-15.497)2 - 4(1)(55)                Simplify.
   c=

                            2(1)

   =      15.497 ± 4.490   = 5.503 or 9.994

             2

    Because there are two positive solutions for side c, either c = 5.503 or
c = 9.994, there are two triangles with the given properties. We apply the Law
of Cosines again to find angle C in each triangle.

    For the triangle with c = 5.503, we have

   c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos(C)              Substitute the known values.
                                          Solve for cos(C).
5.5032 = 82 + 32 - 2(8)(3) cos(C)

cos(C) =  5.5032 - 64 - 9  = 0.889876

          -48

   C = cos-1 0.889876) = 27.1

and A = 180 - (14.4 + 27.1) = 138.5.
For the triangle with c = 9.994, we have

   c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos(C)              Substitute the known values.
                                          Solve for cos(C).
9.9942 = 82 + 32 - 2(8)(3) cos(C)

cos(C) =  9.9942 - 64 - 9  = -0.560027

          -48

   C = cos-1(-0.560027) = 124.1

and A = 180 - (14.4 + 124.1) = 41.5. Both triangles are shown below.

             A                                  9.99                  A

B         14.4 5.5 138.5 27.1  3     B    14.4               41.5
                                                 8    124.1 3
          8                       C
                                                                 C

Note 3.46 In the previous Example, notice that we used the Law of Cosines
instead of the Law of Sines to find a second angle in the triangle, because there
is only one angle between 0 and 180 with a given cosine. We don't have to
check the results, as we would if we used the Law of Sines.

Navigation

Even with the aid of GPS (Global Positioning System) instruments, aircraft
pilots and ship captains need to understand navigation based on trigonometry.

Example 3.48 The sailing club leaves the marina on a heading 15 east of
north and sails for 18 miles. They then change course, and after traveling for
12 miles on a heading 35 east of north, they experience engine trouble and
radio for help. The marina sends a speed boat to rescue them. How far should
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                      127

the speed boat go, and on what heading?                                C
Solution.                                                     12
We'd like to find the distance x and the                     35
angle  shown in the figure. In ABC,
we can calculate the angle at point B                   B
where the sailing club changed course:
                                                      18 x
      B = 180 - 35 + 15 = 160                        15
                                                     
We know a = 12 and c = 18. We use
the Law of Cosines to find b and A.

                                                  A

b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos(B)                 Substitute the known values.
   = 122 + 182 - 2(12)18 cos(160)         Evaluate.
   = 873.95                               Take positive square root.

 b = 29.56

Next, we apply the Law of Cosines again to find A.

a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos(A)                         Substitute the known values.
                                                  Solve for cos(A).
122 = 29.562 + 182 - 2(29.56)(18) cos(A)

cos(A) =  122 - 29.562 - 182  = 0.9903

          -2(29.56)(18)

C = cos-1(0.9903) = 8

    Thus, x = 29.56 and  = 8 + 15 = 23. The speed boat should travel
29.56 miles on a heading 23 east of north.

Which Law to Use

How can we decide which law, the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines, is
appropriate for a given problem?

   · If we are solving a right triangle, we don't need the Laws of Sines and
       Cosines; all we need are the definitions of the trigonometric ratios.

   · But for oblique triangles, we can identify the following cases:
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                            128

                 How to Solve an Oblique Triangle.

If we know:                          We can use:
1. One side and two angles (SAA)     1. Law of Sines, to find another side
2. Two sides and the angle opposite  2. Law of Sines, to find another angle,
one of them (SSA, the ambiguous      or Law of Cosines, to find another
case)                                side
3. Two sides and the included angle  3. Law of Cosines, to find the third
(SAS)                                side
4. Three sides (SSS)                 4. Law of Cosines, to find an angle

Note 3.50 In the ambiguous case, SSA, the Law of Sines is easier to apply,
but there will be two possible angles, and we must check each angle to see if
it produces a solution. Using the Law of Cosines involves solving a quadratic
equation, but each positive solution of the equation yields a solution of the
triangle.

Example 3.51

In the triangle at right, which law should                      C

you use to find B ? Which law should                     6               10
you use to find c ?
                                                      A     40               B

                                                                   c

Solution. We know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of
them. We can use the Law of Sines to find B.

                 sin(B) sin(40)
                                     =
                             6              10

                 sin(B) = 0.3857

    This is the ambiguous case; there are two angles between 0 and 180 with
sine 0.3857, and we must check each angle to see if it produces a solution.

    If instead we start by finding side c, we use the Law of Cosines.

                 102 = 62 + c2 - 2(6)c cos(40)

c2 - (12 cos(40))c - 64 = 0

                      12 cos 40 ±               (-12 cos(40))2 - 4(1)(-64)
                 c=                                   2(1)

    You can check that the quadratic equation has only one positive solution
for c (or notice that because a > b, angle B must be acute).

Concepts

    1 The Law of Sines is not helpful when we know two sides of the triangle
       and the included angle. In this case we need the Law of Cosines.

    2
                                           Law of Cosines.

                If the angles of a triangle are A, B, and C, and the opposite
            sides are respectively a, b, and c, then

                           a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos(A)
                           b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos(B)
                           c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos(C)

3 We can also use the Law of Cosines to find an angle when we know all
   three sides of a triangle.

4 We can use the Law of Cosines to solve the ambiguous case.

       those two sides is , then the area of the triangle is given by

 7 We can use the Law of Sines to find an unknown side in an oblique triangle.
    We must know the angle opposite the unknown side, and another side-
    angle pair.

 8 We can also use the Law of Sines to find an unknown angle of a triangle.
    We must know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of
    them.

 9 Remember that there are two angles with a given sine. When using
    the Law of Sines, we must check whether both angles result in possible
    triangles.

10 We use minutes and seconds to measure very small angles.

12 For the trigonometric ratios of most angles, your calculator gives approxi-
    mations, not exact values.

13 The Law of Sines is not helpful when we know two sides of the triangle
    and the included angle. In this case we need the Law of Cosines.

14
                                        Law of Cosines.

    If the angles of a triangle are A, B, and C, and the opposite
sides are respectively a, b, and c, then

                  a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos(A)
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES                                          137

b2 = a2 + c2 - 2ac cos(B)
c2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab cos(C)

15 We can also use the Law of Cosines to find an angle when we know all
    three sides of a triangle.

16 We can use the Law of Cosines to solve the ambiguous case.

     an arc of radius 3 centered at B.

    Of course, the accuracy of the right angle constructed in this way depends
on the accuracy of the measurements of length. Problems 49 and 50 refer to
the surveyor's technique.

Activity 3.5 Understanding the Law of Sines.

   · Materials: You will need paper and pencil, a ruler, compass, and protrac-
       tor, or a dynamic geometry program such as Geogebra.

A The vertices of a triangle determine a unique circumscribing circle.

1 Draw a large acute triangle and label the vertices A , B, and C.

2 Draw the perpendicular bisector of side AC. You can use a compass,
   or use your ruler and protractor as follows:

a Find the midpoint, M , of side AC.
b Draw a line that passes through M and is perpendicular to side

   AC .

3 Draw the perpendicular bisector of side BC . Label the point where
   the two perpendicular bisectors meet with the letter O.

4 From geometry, we know that every point on the perpendicular
   bisector of a segment P Q is equidistant between P and Q. Use this
   fact to explain why the point O is the same distance from each vertex
   of your triangle.

Using the point at O as the center,            c
draw the circle that passes through all  A
three vertices of your triangle. The
circle is called the circumscribing
circle of the triangle.

   its angle.

1 Measure angle C in your triangle. We say that this angle subtends
   the arc joining A and B on the circle.

2 Choose any other point on the circle that is not on the arc AB. Call
   this point D. Draw the line segments AD and BD to create a second
   triangle. Measure the angle at D; it should be the same as the angle
   C.

3 In fact, all angles with vertex on the circle that subtend the same
   arc have the same measure. Verify this fact by creating two more

   angles that subtend the arc AB.

C What is the length of the diameter of the circumscribing circle?

1 At this point, if your drawing is too cluttered, you may need to make
   a fresh copy of the circumscribing circle. On this circle draw just
   the side AB from your original triangle.

2 Draw the diameter that passes through B (remember that O is the
   center of the circle), and label the other end of the diameter with
   the letter C .

3 Draw triangle ABC , and measure the angle at C . It should be
   the same as angle C in your original triangle. (Why?) Let's call this
   angle .

4 Now measure angle BAC . It should be 90 degrees, This is another
   fact from geometry: Any angle that intercepts the diameter of a
   circle is a right angle. Put a right angle symbol at angle BAC .

5 Label the length of the sides of your triangle as follows:

    · Side BC has length d (for diameter)
    · Side AC has length b
    · Side AB has length c

  (Notice that c is the side opposite the angle ). Using the letters d,
   b, and c as needed, finish the equation

       6 Start from the last equation, and solve for d in terms of sin C and c.

D Equating expressions for the diameter: The Law of Sines

       1 You have now written an expression for the diameter of the circum-
          scribing circle in terms of angle C and its opposite side. If you start
          the derivation with angle B and the arc AC, you will get another
          expression for the diameter. Write that expression here.

       2 Now write an expression for the diameter that results from starting
          with angle A and arc BC.
CHAPTER 3. LAWS OF SINES AND COSINES  145

       3 Write an equation that reflects the fact that the diameter of the
          circle has the same length in all three expressions.
          This is the Law of Sines! All three expressions represent the diameter
          of the circumscribing circle, so they are equal to each other.

E Verification for right and obtuse triangles
   If ABC is not an acute triangle, then one of the angles must either be a
   right angle or an obtuse angle.

      · In a right triangle, call the right angle A. Now you are already at
          step (4) of part C , so the derivation continues as before.

   To see the derivation for an obtuse triangle, follow the steps:

       1 Draw a circle and a triangle with vertices A, B, and C on the circle
          so that there is an obtuse angle at point C.

       2 Measure the angle at C. and note that the larger arc AB subtended
          by  is more than half of the circle.

       3 Choose a point D on the larger arc AB. In triangle ABD, the
          angle at D subtends the shorter arc connecting A and B. Measure
          the angle at D. You should find that the angles at C and D are
          supplementary.

       4 Here is another fact from geometry: The measure of an inscribed
          angle in a circle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Use this
          fact to explain why the angles at C and D are supplementary.

       5 What can you say about the sines of angles C and D? Because it is
          an acute triangle, we can use our original derivation on ABD, and
          substitute C for D in the result.

    A Lissajous figure is a pattern produced by the intersection of two sinu-
soidal curves at right angles to each other. They are the curves you often see
on oscilloscope screens depicting compound vibration.

    They were first studied by the American mathematician Nathaniel Bowditch
in 1815, and later by the French mathematician Jules-Antoine Lissajous, and
today have applications in physics and astronomy, medicine, music, and many
other fields.

    In 1855 Lissajous invented a pair of tuning forks designed to visualize sound
vibrations. Each tuning fork had a small mirror mounted at the end of one
prong, and a light beam reflected from one mirror to the other was projected
onto a screen, producing a Lissajous figure. Stable patterns appear only when
the two forks vibrate at frequencies in simple ratios, such as 2:1 or 3:2, which
correspond to the musical intervals of the octave and perfect fifth. So, by
observing the Lissajous figures, people were able to make tuning adjustments
more accurately than they could do by ear.

    In 1942 the Dadaist artist Max Ernst punched a small hole in a can of paint,
attached it to a coupled pendulum, and set it swinging to create Lissajous
figures. He then used the designs in some of his paintings.

    In 2001, NASA launched the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) to make fundamental measurements of our universe as a whole.
The probe was positioned near a gravitational balance point between Earth and
the Sun and moved in a controlled Lissajous pattern around the point. This
orbit isolated the spacecraft from radio emissions from Earth.

    The goal of WMAP was to map the relative cosmic microwave background
(CMB) temperature over the full sky. CMB radiation is the radiant heat left over
from the Big Bang. Tiny fluctuations in the CMB are the result of fluctuations
in the density of matter in the early universe, so they carry information about
the initial conditions for the formation of cosmic structures such as galaxies,
clusters, and voids.

    Here is the first fine-resolution map of the microwave sky, produced from
the WMAP data. This picture of the infant universe shows the temperature
fluctuations corresponding to the seeds of galaxies.

    From the WMAP data, scientists were able to:
    · estimate the age of the universe at 13.77 billion years old.
    · calculate the curvature of space to within 0.4% of "flat" Euclidean.
    · determine that ordinary atoms (also called baryons) make up only 4.6%

       of the universe.
    · find that dark matter (matter not made of atoms) is 24.0% of the universe.

4.1 Angles and Rotation

Introduction

So far we have studied angles as parts of triangles, but we can also use angles

to describe rotation. For example, think of the minute hand on a clock. Every
hour, the minute hand moves through one complete rotation, or 360. In two
hours, the minute hand rotates through 720.

Example 4.1 Through how many degrees does the minute hand rotate in an
hour and a half? In forty minutes?

Solution.

Look at the figure at right. An hour                      11 12  1
and a half represents 1.5 complete ro-               10              2

                                                     9                3
             1.5(360) = 540
                                                      8              4

                                                        540

Forty minutes is two-thirds of an hour,                   11 12  1
so the minute hand rotates through                   10              2

Angles in Standard Position

The degree measure of an angle depends only on the fraction of a whole rotation
between its sides, and not on the location or position of the angle. To compare
and analyze angles, we place them in standard position, so that the vertex of
the angle is located at the origin and its initial side lies on the positive x-axis.
If the terminal side rotates counter-clockwise, the degree measure of the angle
is positive; it is negative if the terminal side rotates clockwise. The figure below
shows four angles and how each appears in standard position.

    One-half a complete revolution is 180, and three-quarters of one revolution
is 270. Thus, for angles between 180 and 270 in standard position, the
terminal side lies in the third quadrant, and for angles between 270 and 360,
the terminal side lies in the fourth quadrant.

Example 4.3 Find the degree measure of the angles  and  shown below,
and sketch each angle in standard position.

                                    1 (360) = 72
                                    5

In standard position, it is a first-quadrant angle, as shown in figure (a) below.

                    = 72

                                        = 330

                                    12

In standard position, it is a fourth-quadrant angle. (See Figure (b).)

Trigonometric Ratios for All Angles

In Chapter 3 we defined the sine, cosine, and tangent for obtuse angles by
placing the angle in a Cartesian coordinate system. We can do the same for
angles that represent rotations.

· First, we place the angle  in standard position,

with its vertex at the origin. We picture the ter-

minal side sweeping counter-clockwise around a

circle to form the angle.                                  

· Next, we choose a point P with coordinates (x, y)           r
   on the terminal side, as shown at right. The dis-       P (x, y)
   tance from the origin to P is then r = x2 + y2.
   The trigonometric ratios of  are defined as fol-
   lows.

           The Trigonometric Ratios.

    If  is an angle in standard position, and (x, y) is a point on its
terminal side, with r = x2 + y2, then

                      y                  x                    y
         sin() =           cos() =              tan() =

                      r                  r                    x

    We can choose any point on the terminal side of the angle, and the trig
ratios defined by its coordinates will be the same. (Can you explain why?
Think about similar triangles.) And, as we noted when we first defined the trig
ratios, they are functions of the input angle, so there is only one sine, cosine,
or tangent for a given angle.

Note 4.5 The notation sin() is read "sine of theta," just as we say "f of x" for
f (x). The parentheses do not mean multiplication, but rather tell us to apply
the function.

    Because it is the distance from the origin to P , r is always positive. However,
x and y can be positive or negative (or zero), depending on the angle . For
example, in the second quadrant, x is negative but y is positive, so the cosine
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                                    151

and the tangent of angles between 90 and 180 are negative, but their sines
are positive.

Example 4.6 Give the sign of each of the three trigonometric ratios of the
angles.

a 200                                                  b 300

Solution. a. In standard position, the terminal side of an angle of 200 lies

in the third quadrant. (See figure (a) below.) In the third quadrant, x < 0
and y < 0, but r > 0. Thus, sin(200) is negative, cos(200) is negative, and
tan(200) is positive.

              200

                                                      300

    b. The terminal side of 300 lies in the fourth quadrant, so x > 0 and y < 0,
and r > 0. Thus, sin(300) is negative, cos(300) is positive, and tan(300) is

negative.

                                                    r6

To find the x-coordinate of P , we use the equation of a circle of radius 6,
x2 + y2 = 36.

                          x2 + (-5)2 = 36

                             x2 = 36 - 25 = 11
                                      

                              x = ± 11

                                                        
Because P is in the third quadrant, x = - 11. Thus,

                                                                 5

Reference Angles

In Section 3.1 we learned that the trig ratios for angles in the second quadrant
are the same as the trig ratios for their supplements, except for sign. For
example, you can use your calculator to verify that

sin(130) = 0.7660   sin(50) = 0.7660       P                             P
cos(130) = -0.6428  cos(50) = 0.6428              r          130 r
tan(130) = -1.1918  tan(50) = 1.1918

                                                       50    50

                                           Q                                Q

    The trig ratios for 130 and 50 have the same absolute value because the
two triangles formed by the angles are congruent, as shown above.

       OP Q is called a reference triangle for 130, and 50 is called the
reference angle.

    The trig ratios for angles between 180 and 360, whose terminal sides lie
in the third and fourth quadrants, are also related to the trig ratios of familiar
angles in the first quadrant. We "refer" the angle to a first quadrant angle with
a congruent reference triangle.

Note 4.10 Reference angles will be important when we need to solve trigono-
metric equations. There will always be two angles with the same trig ratio
(except for quadrantal angles), and they will have the same reference angle.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                153

    We can construct reference triangles for angles in any of the four quadrants,
and the trig ratios of the angle are the same as the trig ratios of its reference
angle, up to sign. Here is how to construct a reference triangle for an angle :

                          Constructing a reference triangle.

         1 Choose a point P on the terminal side.

         2 Draw a line from point P perpendicular to the x-axis.

    The figure below shows angles  between 0 and 360, and the reference
angle, , for each. Study the figures, and make sure you understand the formula
for finding the reference angle in each quadrant.

              P (x, y)              P (x, y)
             r
                                             r
         = ~                                     ~ 
First-quadrant: ~ = 
                            Second-quadrant: ~ = 180 - 

                            
            ~                         ~
        r                                 r

P (x, y)                                  P (x, y)

Third-quadrant: ~ =  - 180  Fourth-quadrant: ~ = 360 - 

Note 4.11 These observations may help you remember the formulas:

   · The right triangle formed in this way always lies between the terminal
       side and the x-axis.

   · The positive acute angle formed between the terminal side and the x-axis
       is the reference angle, and the right triangle is the reference triangle.

Using Reference Angles

Here is a summary of our discussion about reference angles.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                        156

                                 Reference Angles.

    The trigonometric ratios of any angle are equal to the ratios of its
reference angle, except for sign. The sign of the ratio is determined by
the quadrant.

    Any acute angle  is the reference angle for four angles between 0 and
360, one in each quadrant. The figure below shows the four angles in standard
position whose reference angle is 35. Note that each angle is found by measuring
35 from the x-axis in the appropriate quadrant, and that the four angles
together make a "bow-tie" shape.

                                                       y

                  145                           35

                       35                   35

                                                x

                       35                   35

                  215                           325

    From the figure, you can see that the angles in each quadrant with a given
reference angle are computed as follows.

           To find an angle  with a given reference angle :.

   Quadrant I:    =           Quadrant II:              = 180 - 
   Quadrant III:    = 180 +   Quadrant IV:               = 360 -

   reference angle 51.3. That angle is

          = 180 -                                  51.3

         = 180 - 51.3 = 128.7

   And in the third quadrant,                      231.3
                                                                     b.

The Special Angles

Recall that the angles 30, 45 and 60 are called the special angles because we
can express the exact values of their trigonometric ratios in terms of radicals.
There are special angles in all four quadrants; namely, those whose reference
angles are 30, 45 and 60.

Example 4.16 Find exact values for the sine, cosine, and tangent of 210.

Solution. An angle of 210 lies in the third quadrant, and its reference angle
is

                                     = 210 - 180 = 30

In the third quadrant, the sine and cosine are negative, so we have

                     -1                                         1
         sin() = ,                -3               tan() = 
                         cos() =          ,
                      2           2                               3

                                                             y

Alternatively, consider the reference triangle in

the figure at right, where r = 2. Because the

sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the ratio 1 :                        210
  3 : 2, the point P has coordinates (- 3, -1).
                                                                                            x

Using the definitions of the trig ratios, we can           2
calculate the values above.

Coterminal Angles

Because 360 represents one complete revolution, we can add or subtract a
multiple of 360 to any angle, and the terminal side will arrive at the same
position. For example, the angles 70 and 430 have the same terminal side
because 430 = 70 + 360. Such angles are called coterminal.

    The angle 790 is also coterminal with 70, because if we add two revolutions
to 70, we get 790 = 70 + 2(360), as shown below.

                      70                                         70

                 430                            790

Because coterminal angles have the same standard position, their trigono-

metric ratios are equal. For example, you can verify that, to four decimal

places,

                      cos(790) = cos(70) = 0.3420

Example 4.18

a Find an angle between 0 and 360 that is coterminal with 520.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                 159

b Use a calculator to verify that the trig ratios of 520 are the same as the
   ratios of the coterminal angle.

Solution.

    a We subtract multiples of 360 from 520 until the remainder is less than
       360.
                                          520 - 360 = 160
       Because 160 is between 0 and 360, this is the angle we want.

    b You can use your calculator to see that

                                 sin(160) = sin(520) = 0.3420
                                 cos(160) = cos(520) = -0.9397
                                 tan(160) = tan(520) = -0.3640

If the direction of rotation is important, we let positive

angles represent rotation in the counter-clockwise

direction, and negative angles represent rotation in

the clockwise direction. For example, the angle -60         
shown at right lies in the fourth quadrant. It is 300
                                                              -60

coterminal with -60 + 360 = 300.

Concepts

1 We can use angles to describe rotation. Positive angles indicate rotation
   in the counter-clockwise direction; negative angles describe clockwise
   rotation.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                  161

2 We define the trigonometric ratios of any angle by placing the angle
   in standard position and choosing a point on the terminal side, with
   r = x2 + y2.

               The Trigonometric Ratios.

    If  is an angle in standard position, and (x, y) is a point on
its terminal side, with r = x2 + y2, then

            y                           x                 y
sin() =                     cos() =           tan() =

            r                           r                 x

3 To construct a reference triangle for an angle :

      1 Choose a point P on the terminal side.
      2 Draw a line from point P perpendicular to the x-axis.

4 The reference angle for  is the positive acute angle formed between
   the terminal side of  and the x-axis.

              P (x, y)                    P (x, y)

P (x, y)                                     P (x, y)

Third-quadrant: ~ =  - 180        Fourth-quadrant: ~ = 360 - 

5 The trigonometric ratios of any angle are equal to the ratios of its reference
   angle, except for sign. The sign of the ratio is determined by the quadrant.

6
             To find an angle  with a given reference angle :.

Quadrant I:    =                  Quadrant II:          = 180 - 
Quadrant III:    = 180 +          Quadrant IV:           = 360 - 

                = 180 - ~      y               = ~

                            ~              ~  x

                            ~              ~

                = 180 + ~                   = 360 - ~

4.2 Graphs of Trigonometric Functions

A Periodic Function of Angle

Imagine that you are riding on a Ferris wheel. As the wheel turns, your
height above the ground increases and then decreases again, repeating the same
pattern each time the Ferris wheel makes a complete rotation. This pattern
is an example of a periodic function. We use periodic functions to model
phenomena that exhibit cyclical behavior, such as the height of tides, seasonal
patterns of growth in plants and animals, radio waves, and planetary motion.

    We'll create a mathematical model for a ride on a Ferris wheel that has
a radius of 100 feet and rotates counterclockwise. Our model will be a function
that describes your height above the ground as you ride the wheel. In order
to graph the Ferris wheel function, we must first specify the input and output
variables, and then choose a coordinate system to display their values.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                         167

We'll place the origin at the center of the Ferris      100 y
wheel. Then the line from the origin to your                
position on the wheel makes an angle with the                         h
horizontal, as shown at right. This angle, , will
be the input variable for the function. Your
height, h, is also a variable, and is related to
the y-coordinate of your position; in fact, we 100
see that h = y + 100, because the center of the
wheel is 100 feet above the ground.

    To simplify the model, we'll first graph y as the output variable, instead
of h. As the angle  increases from 0 to 90, your y-coordinate increases from
0 to 100. You are then at the top of the wheel. Then, as  increases from 90
to 180, your y-coordinate decreases from 100 back to 0.

100  100

                                                        210 270

                                             30 90 135
                                                 60

    Finally, as  increases from 180 to 360, your y-coordinate decreases from 0
to -100 and then increases from -100 back to 0. You have made one complete
rotation on the Ferris wheel. If you go around again,  increases from 360 to
720, and the graph of your y-coordinate will repeat the pattern of the first
rotation. The figure above shows how your y-coordinate is plotted as a function
of the angle .

                                                                                                   y
    Look back at the diagram of the Ferris wheel and notice that sin() = ,
so 100

                                          y = 100 sin()

    For example, when  = 30, the y-coordinate is

        y = 100 sin (30) = 100 1 = 50                          100
                                          2                         30 50

and your height above the ground is          100

               h = y + 100 = 150 feet

    In general, then, h is given as a function of  by

                               h = y + 100 = 100 sin () + 100

This is our model for your height on a Ferris wheel ride.

The Sine Function

Our Ferris wheel model used values of sin(), so let us explore its properties.
Remember that the trigonometric ratio sin() is actually a function of the angle
. Thus, for each value of , there is only one value of sin(), and we may write
f () = sin().
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                          168

Activity 4.3 Graph of the Sine Function. Graph the sine function
f () = sin().

    1 First make a table of values. You can use your calculator's table feature
       to fill in the following values, rounded to two decimal places.

2 Plot the points in the table and connect them with a smooth curve to
   graph the sine function for angles in the first quadrant, from 0 to 90.

                                      y

                                   1

                                                    
                    0 60 120 180

                                  -1

3 Recall that the values of sin() for angles in the second quadrant can be
   found using reference angles: sin(180 - ) = sin(). This fact gives us
  values of sin  from 90 to 180.

       100     110  120  130  140   150               160              170  180

Continue your graph from part (2) for second quadrant angles.

4 The values of sin() in the third and fourth quadrants are the negatives
   of their values in the second and first quadrants.

5 The graph of f () = sin() from 0 to 360 is shown below.
                     y

                  1

                                                            
  0 60 120 180 240 300 360

                     -1
    If we continue the graph for angles larger than 360 or smaller than 0,
we find that the same pattern repeats, as shown below. This should not be
surprising, because we know that coterminal angles have the same trigonometric
ratios.

                                       y

                                     1

-360 -270 -180 -90                                                                         
                       90 180 270 360 450 540 630 720

                                    -1

    The sine is an example of a periodic function. The smallest interval on
which the graph repeats is called the period of the graph. From the graph in
the previous example, we make the following observations:

                           Properties of the Sine Function.

        · The period of the sine function is 360.

        · The maximum and minimum function values are 1 and 1, respec-
            tively.

        · The graph oscillates around its midline, the horizontal line y = 0.

        · The distance between the midline and either the maximum or
            minimum value is called the amplitude of the function, so the
            amplitude of the sine function is 1.

    You can use your calculator to graph the sine function, by entering
                      Y1 = SIN X, T, , n )

    and pressing ZOOM 7 for the trig window. The graph shows two periods of
the sine function, from  = -360 to  = 360.

The Cosine Function

In the previous exercise you graphed the height of a person riding on a Ferris
wheel. Your graph involved sin(), because the sine function tells us the y-
coordinate of a point that travels around a circle. The cosine function tells us
the x-coordinate of a point that travels around a circle.

Example 4.21

Small adjustments to the fit of a bicycle can affect
both the cyclist's efficiency and the stress on his or
her jounts. The KOPS rule (Knee Over Pedal Stem)
aligns the cyclist's knee directly over the pedal at
the point of maximum force, as shown at right. As
the cyclist's foot rotates away from this KOPS line,
stress on the knee increases.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                       171

a Suppose the pedal crank is 18 centimeters long. When the crank makes
   an angle  with the horizontal, how far is the cyclist's foot displaced
   horizontally from the KOPS line?

b Graph the horizontal displacement, d, as a function of .

Solution.

    a The cyclist's foot travels around a circle of radius 18 centimeters. If we
       place the origin at the center of the chain gear, the x-coordinate of the
       foot is given by
                                       x = r cos() = 18 cos()

(See the figure at right.) The KOPS line is           d
the vertical line x = 18, so the horizontal  18
distance between the cyclist's foot and the
KOPS line is                                   

          d = 18 - 18 cos()

                                                                         x = 18

b You can use your calculator to verify the table and graph for the function

             d = 18 - 18 cos()

shown below.

  0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360
 d 0 2.4 9 18 27 33.6 36 33.6 27 18 9 2.4 0

            0 60 120 180 240 300 360

    In the example above, the period is 360, the amplitude is 18 cm, and the
midline is d = 18.

    You can see that the cosine graph is similar to the sine graph, but they are
not identical.

b Period: 360, amplitude: 1, midline: y = 0. The cosine graph starts
  ( = 0) at its high point, while the sine graph starts ( = 0) at its
   midline.

Interlude: Review of Function Notation

Perhaps it is time to review our use of function notation. Recall that we use
the notation y = f (x) to indicate that y is a function of x, that is, x is the
input variable and y is the output variable.

Example 4.23 Make a table of input and output values and a graph for the
function y = f (x) = 9 - x2.

Solution. We choose several values for the input variable, x, and evaluate
the function to find the corresponding values of the output variable, y. For
example,

                                  f (-3) = 9 - (-3)2 = 0

                                                          y

We plot the points in the table and con-     4

nect them to obtain the graph shown at       3

right. x  -3  -2  -1 0   1   2            3  2
                            
y 0 5 22 3 22 5 0                            1

                                             -4 -3 -2 -1                     x
                                                             1234
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                                                  173

    Of course, we don't always use x and y for the input and output variables.
In the previous example, we could write w = f (t) = 9 - t2 for the function,
so that t is the input and w is the output. The table of values and the graph
are the same; only the names of the variables have changed.

Note 4.24 When we discuss trigonometric functions, there are several variables
involved. Our definitions of the trig ratios involve four variables: x, y, r, and ,
as illustrated below.

                  y                                            y
                                                  P (x, y)
                     
                               x                       r=1 
                                                                             x
                r

                P (x, y)

    If the value of r is fixed for a given situation, such as the Ferris wheel or
the bicycle wheel discussed above, then x and y are both functions of . This
means that the values of x and y depend only on the value of the angle . If
r = 1, we have

                    x = f () = cos()
                    y = g() = sin()

The graphs of these functions are shown below. Note particularly that the
horizontal axis displays values of the input variable, and the vertical axis
displays the output variable.

          x                                                 y

       1                                                 1                                        
             90 180 270 360 450                                90 180 270 360 450
-90                                               -90
      -1                                                -1

    If we use different variables for the input and output, the functions and
their graphs are the same, but the axes should be labeled with the appropriate
variables.

Checkpoint 4.25 Sketch a graph of each function, and label the axes.

Caution 4.26 When we write cos(), we are using "cos" as the name of a
function whose input is .

    A common mistake is to think of cos() as a product, cos times , but this
makes no sense, because "cos" by itself has no meaning. Remember that cos()
represents a single number, namely the output of the cosine function.

The Tangent Function

The tangent function is periodic, but its graph is not similar
to the graphs of sine and cosine. Recall that the tangent of
an angle in standard position is defined by

                                            y
                               tan() =

                                            x

Study the figure at right to see that as  increases from 0
to 90, y increases while x remains constant, so the value
of tan() increases.

Example 4.27 Sketch a graph of f () = tan() for 0    180.
Solution. You can use your calculator to verify the following values for tan .

                                         10

     0 30 60 70 80 85 As                  8

  tan() 0 0.58 1.73 2.75 5.67 11.43       4
                                          2
 gets closer to 90, tan() increases
very rapidly. Recall that tan(90) is                                                
                                                 30 60 90 120150180
undefined, so there is no point on       -2
the graph at  = 90. The graph of         -4
f () = tan() for 0   < 90 is shown

at right.

    For  in the second quadrant, the tangent is negative. The reference angle
for each angle in the second quadrant is its supplement, so

                                         (-x, y)                   (x, y)

            tan() = - tan(180 - )                 r             r

as shown at right. For example, you can              130
verify that                                                    50

tan(130) = - tan(180 - 130) = - tan(50) = -1.19

In particular, for values of  close to

90, the values of tan() are large neg- 4

ative numbers. We plot several points 2

and sketch the graph in the second

                                               -8

                                               -10

    Now let's consider the graph of f () = tan() in the third and fourth
quadrants. The tangent is positive in the third quadrant, and negative in the
fourth quadrant. In fact, from the figure below you can see that the angles 
and 180 +  are vertical angles.

                                (x, y)

                                               (x, y)

                       180 +                                                                      

                                               180 + 

                                                                                                  (-x, -y)

(-x, -y)

    Because  and 180 +  have the same reference angle, they have the same
tangent. For example,

                                tan(200) = tan(20)
                                tan(230) = tan(50)
                                tan(250) = tan(70)

Thus, the graph of tan() in the third quadrant is the same as its graph in
the first quadrant. Similarly, the graph of the tangent function in the fourth
quadrant is the same as its graph in the second quadrant. The completed graph
is shown below.

Period, Midline and Amplitude

All sine and cosine graphs have the characteristic "wave" shape we've seen in
previous examples. But we can alter the size and frequency of the waves by
changing the formula for the function. In the next example we consider three
variations of the sine function.

Example 4.29 Make a table of values and sketch a graph for each of the
functions. How does each differ from the graph of y = sin() ?

a y = 3 sin()  b y = 3 + sin()                                 c y = sin(3)

Solution.

a We make a table with multiples of 45.

               0 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 360

y = 3 sin() 0 2.1 3 2.1 0                -2.1 -3 -2.1 0

We plot the points, and connect them y                                 y = 3 sin()
with a sine-shaped wave. Compare the 3
graph, shown at right, to the graph of 2                                 y = sin()
y = sin(). The graph is like a sine graph, 1                                              
except that it oscillates between a maxi-
mum value of 3 and a minimum value of -1                       90 180 270 360
-3. The amplitude of this function is 3. -2

                                                           -3

b Again, we make a table of values with multiples of 45 and plot the points.

               0 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 360

y = 3 + sin() 3 3.7 4 3.7 3              2.3 2                 2.1 3

This graph has the same amplitude as y                                   y = 3 + sin()
y = sin(), but the entire graph is shifted 5
up by 3 units, as shown at right. The 4                                  y = sin()
midline of this function is the line y = 3. 3                                             

                                                            2  90 180 270 360
                                                            1

                                                           -1

c This time we'll make a table with multiples of 15.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                       177

   y = sin(3) 0.7 1 0.7 0 -0.7 -1 -0.7 0             0.7 1        0.7 0

   You can continue the table for  between        y
   180 and 360, and plot the points to
                                              3
   find the graph shown at right. The graph
                                              2 y = sin()   y = sin(3)
   has the same amplitude and midline as      1

   y = sin(), but it completes three cycles                                     
   from 0 to 360 instead of one cycle. The           90 180 270 360
   period of this graph is one-third of 360,
   or 120.                                    -3

    The graphs in the previous example illustrate a general rule about sine and
cosine graphs.

                          Amplitude, Period, and Midline.

   1 The graph of

                     y = A cos() or y = A sin()

                                             Coordinates.

                If point P is located at a distance r from the origin in the direc-
            tion specified by angle  in standard position, then the coordinates
            of P are

                                 x = r cos() and y = r sin()

2 Navigational directions for ships and planes are sometimes given as
   bearings, which are angles measured clockwise from north.

3 Periodic functions are used to model phenomena that exhibit cyclical
   behavior.

4 The trigonometric ratios sin() and cos() are functions of the angle .

5 The period of the sine function is 360. Its midline is the horizontal
   line y = 0, and the amplitude of the sine function is 1.

6 The graph of the cosine function has the same period, midline, and
   amplitude as the graph of the sine function. However, the locations of
   the intercepts and of the maximum and minimum values are different.

7 We use the notation y = f (x) to indicate that y is a function of x, that
   is, x is the input variable and y is the output variable.

8 The tangent function has period 180. It is undefined at odd multiples of
   90, and is increasing on each interval of its domain.

9
                                   Angle of Inclination.

            The angle of inclination of a line is the angle  measured in
       the positive direction from the positive x-axis to the line. If the
       slope of the line is m, then

                                           tan  = m

4.3 Using Trigonometric Functions

Solving Trigonometric Equations

One of the main reasons we learned about reference angles is to help us solve

trigonometric equations. Remember that there are always two angles between

0 and 180 with a given sine ratio between 0 and 1.

For example, the two solutions to the equation sin() = 0.4226 are 25

and 155. That is,

                       sin(25) = sin(155) = 0.4226

These two angles are supplementary, so they have the same reference angle, as
shown below.

                   y                                y

155                    25 x                             25 x
        25                                                     335

                                     25
                             205

                   a.                               b.

    There are also two solutions between 0 and 360 to the equation sin() =
-0.4226. They are the angles in the third and fourth quadrants whose reference
angle is 25, namely 205 and 355, as shown above. But your calculator will
only give you one of these angles!

Example 4.33 You are riding on the Ferris wheel we modeled in Section 4.2,
where your height above ground is given as a function of  by

                       h = 100 + 100 sin()

When your height is at least 136 feet, you can see the snow on a distant mountain
range. Between what angles of rotation can you see snow?

Solution.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                           188

Look at the diagram of the Ferris wheel to                           36
                                                                        100
see that when your height is 136 feet, the
                           36

sine of the angle  is , or 0.36. The angle
                          100

with sine 0.36 is

          sin-1(0.36) = 21.1                   136

    And you will be able to see snow until you descend again below 136 feet.
That will happen at the angle in the second quadrant with sine 0.36, namely,
the second quadrant angle with reference angle 21.1°. And that angle is

                                    180 - 21.1 = 158.9.

Checkpoint 4.34 Refer to the Example in Section 4.2. about the Knee Over
Pedal Stem Rule. The distance between the cyclist's foot and the KOPS line is

          d = 18 - 18 cos()

At what angles is the cyclist's knee within 9 centimeters of the KOPS line?
Answer.

                                                                    9

When the angle of the crank is between 0° and                18
60°, and again between 300° and 360°.                           60

                                                                                                                      x = 18

Example 4.35 Solve the equation sin() = -0.6428 for angles between 0
and 360. Round your answers to the nearest degree.
Solution. Use your calculator to evaluate

          sin-1(-0.6428) = -40

The angle -40 is in the fourth quadrant, but it is not between 0 and 360.
We need an angle that is coterminal with -40, so we add 360.

          -40 + 360 = 320

Thus, one of the solutions is 320.

The sine is also negative in the third quadrant, so          y

there should also be a solution in the third quadrant.

The reference angle for 320 is 40, and the third-

quadrant angle with reference angle 40 is 220, as

shown at right. You can check that, rounded to four 40                          x
decimal places, both angles satisfy the equation,                      40

that is,                                                220            320

sin(320) = -0.6428 and sin(220) = -0.6428
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                                              189

Note 4.36 In the previous example we found two solutions of the equation
sin() = -0.6428. Actually, there are infinitely many solutions -- namely, all
the angles coterminal with 320 or 220. Because we can easily find coterminal
solutions by adding or subtracting multiples of 360, when solving an equation
we usually list only the solutions between 0 and 360.

Caution 4.37 When you ask your calculator to find an angle with a given sine
(or cosine or tangent), it will give you only one of the many possible answers.
You must be careful to choose the appropriate answer for the situation, using
reference and coterminal angles.

Checkpoint 4.38 Solve the equation tan() = -0.4 for angles between 0 and
360.

Answer. 338.2, 158.2

The Unit Circle

Now that we are thinking of angles as rotations, we'll introduce a tool called

the unit circle that will be useful as we proceed.
    Figure (a) below shows an angle of 30 in standard position in a circle of

radius 2. The hypotenuse of its reference triangle is the radius of the circle, so
the legs of the triangle have lengths 1 and 3. Thecoordinates of the point P
where the terminal side meets the circle are thus ( 3, 1). (You can check that
these coordinates satisfy the equation of the circle, x2 + y2 = 4.)

                  y                                               y

                                 x                                       3

                        3                                              2

                  a.                                              b.

Now consider the circle of radius 1 in Figure (b). A circle of radius 1 is

called a unit circle. In this figure, the hypotenuse of the reference triangle for

30 has length 1. What are the coordinates of the point Q where the terminal

side  meets  the  circle?  Each  side  of  this  triangle  is  1  the  length  of  the  sides   of
                                                               2               

the similar triangle in Figure (a), so the coordinates of Q are 23 , 21 . (Once

again, you should check that these coordinates satisfy the equation of the circle,

x2 + y2 = 1.)

Perhaps you recognize the coordinates of the point Q. Because r = 1 in this

circle, the definitions of the sine and cosine are

                           xx                                     yy
               cos() = = = x and sin() = = = y
                           r1                                     r1

We see that the coordinates (x, y) of Q are given by (cos(), sin()). We have
discovered an important property of unit circles.

                           Angles in a Unit Circle.

    Let P be a point on a unit circle determined by the terminal side of
an angle  in standard position. Then the coordinates (x, y) of P are

    given by          x = cos(), y = sin()
Example 4.39
                                                                             y

Find the coordinates of point P on the unit circle        315                       x
shown at right.                                                      1          P

Solution. The coordinates of P are given by

                      x = cos(315), y = sin(315).

The reference angle for 315 is 360 - 315 = 45, so the trig ratios of 315

are the same as the ratios for 45, up to sign.

Because  315  is  in  the  fourth  quadrant,    we  have  cos(315)              =  1      and
                                                                                     2

sin(315) = -1 . Thus, the coordinates of P are 1 , -1 .

5 What do you notice about the coordinates of the point located on the
   unit circle by an angle and the values of the trig ratios of that angle?

Location by Coordinates

One of the most useful applications of the trigonometric ratios allows us to find

distances or locations specified by angles. Starting with the definitions of sine

and cosine,  x                            y

             cos() = and sin() =          r
             r

we can solve for x and y, the coordinates of points on the terminal side of the

angle, and obtain the following results.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                                               192

                                     Coordinates.
    If point P is located at a distance r from the origin in the direction
specified by angle  in standard position, then the coordinates of P are

                      x = r cos() and y = r sin()

These formulas make sense when we think                                  y
of the unit circle. On a unit circle, the                                          P (r cos , r sin )

                                                                                              x
 are cos(), sin() , as shown at right.
                                                                   x2 + y2 = 1
On a circle of radius r, the angle  forms a                                       x2 + y2 = r2
similar triangle whose dimensions are scaled
up by a factor of r. In particular, the legs
of the new triangle are r times larger than
the original triangle.

Example 4.41 Point P is located 6 centimeters from the origin in the direction
of 292. Find the coordinates of P , rounded to hundredths.

Solution.

The location of point P is shown at right. We

see that r = 6, and we can use a calculator to                     y

evaluate cos(292) and sin(292).

x = r cos(292) and y = r sin(292)                                                             x
                                                                   292
= 6(0.3746)   = 6(-0.9272)
                                                                      r = 6 P (x, y)
= 2.2476      = -5.5632

The coordinates of P are approximately
(2.25, -5.56).

Bearings

Navigational directions for ships and planes are                 N

sometimes given as bearings, which are angles                       110

measured clockwise from north. For example,          = 340
a bearing of 110 is equivalent to an angle of
-20 in standard position, or to its coterminal
angle 340, as shown at right.

    From this example, we see that to convert a bearing to an angle  in standard
position, we can subtract the bearing from 90, or

                                      = -bearing + 90

Example 4.43 Francine leaves the airport at a bearing of 245 and flies 60
miles. How far south of the airport is she at that time?
Solution. A bearing of 245 is in the same direction as an angle of

              -245 + 90 = -155                                                 N  bearing
in standard position, as shown at right, or                                        245
as the coterminal angle                                             = 205
                                                                 y
              -155 + 360 = 205.
                                                                        60 mi

    We would like the y-coordinate of Francine's position, so we calculate
y = r sin(205).

               y = r sin(205)
                 = 60(-0.4226) = -25.36

Francine is about 25.4 miles south of the airport.

Checkpoint 4.44 Delbert leaves the airport and flies 150 miles at a bearing
of 132. How far east of the airport is he at that time?
Answer. 111.5 mile

Angle of Inclination

The tangent function also has applications in                    y
measurement. The figure at right shows a line                              x
in the xy-plane. The angle  measured in the
positive direction from the positive x-axis to the
line is called the angle of inclination of the
line.

Recall that the slope of a line is given by the ratio            y

y change in y
m= =           as we move from one point
x change in x

to another on the line. So, if we create a right                                           y

triangle by dropping a perpendicular segment from

gives the slope of the line.

But the ratio  opposite  is also the tangent of the angle .

                               Angle of Inclination.

    The angle of inclination of a line is the angle  measured in the
positive direction from the positive x-axis to the line. If the slope of the
line is m, then

Answer. 129.8
    Thinking about slope and the angle of inclination can help us understand

the graph of the tangent functin.

The slopes increase towards infin-   5
ity as  increases. But the values
of the slope m are the values of     4
tan(), and if we plot those val-
ues against , we see the graph       3
of the tangent function emerging.

Sinusoidal Functions

Many interesting functions have graphs shaped like sines or cosines, even though
they may not be functions of angles.

Example 4.49 Imagine a grandfather clock. As the minute hand sweeps
around, the height of its tip changes with time. Which of the graphs shown
below best represents the height of the tip of the minute hand as a function of
time?

           h                      h                 h

                       t                        t                                              t
           a.                        b.                                             c.

Solution. Figure (a) is not the graph of a function at all: It does not pass
the vertical line test. That is, some values of t, such as t = 0, correspond to
more than one value of h, which is not possible in the graph of a function.

    Figure (b) shows the height of the minute hand varying between a maximum
and minimum value. The height decreases at a constant rate (the graph is
straight and the slope is constant) until the minimum is reached, and then
increases at a constant rate.

But notice that during the 10 minutes from 12:10       12

to 12:20 the height of the minute hand decreases

about half the diameter of the clock, while from 9                                  3     1  diameter
12:20 to 12:30 the height decreases only about                                            2

a quarter of the diameter of the clock, as shown       6                               1  diameter
                                                                                       4

at right.

    Thus the height of the minute hand does not decrease at a constant rate.
    Figure (c) is the best choice. The graph is curved because the slopes are
not constant. The graph is steep when the height is changing rapidly, and
the graph is nearly horizontal when the height is changing slowly. The height
changes slowly near the hour and the half-hour, and more rapidly near the
quarter-hours.

Checkpoint 4.50 As the moon revolves around the earth, the percent of the
disk that we see varies sinusoidally with a period of approximately 30 days.
There are eight phases, starting with the new moon, when the moon's disk is
dark, followed by waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon,
waning gibbous, last quarter, and waning crescent. Which graph best represents
the phases of the moon?

Concepts

    1 To solve an equation of the form sin() = k, or cos() = k, or tan() = k,
       we can use the appropriate inverse trig key on a calculator to find one
       solution (or a coterminal angle.) We use reference angles to find a second
       solution between 0 and 360.

    2
                                     Angles in a Unit Circle.

                Let P be a point on a unit circle determined by the terminal
            side of an angle  in standard position. Then the coordinates (x, y)
            of P are given by

                                      x = cos(), y = sin()

CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS  202

                                 Coordinates.

    If point P is located at a distance r from the origin in the direc-
tion specified by angle  in standard position, then the coordinates
of P are

                     x = r cos() and y = r sin()

4 Navigational directions for ships and planes are sometimes given as
   bearings, which are angles measured clockwise from north.

5
                                   Angle of Inclination.

            The angle of inclination of a line is the angle  measured in
       the positive direction from the positive x-axis to the line. If the
       slope of the line is m, then

                                           tan  = m

       where 0    180.

6
                                     Periodic Function.

            The function y = f (x) is periodic if there is a smallest value
       of p such that

                                        f (x + p) = f (x)
       for all x. The constant p is called the period of the function.

     b A weight is 6.5 feet above the floor, suspended from the ceiling
        by a spring. The weight is pulled down to 5 feet above the floor
        and released, rising past 6.5 feet in 0.5 seconds before attaining its
        maximum height of feet. Neglecting the effects of friction, the height
        of the weight will continue to oscillate between its minimum and
        maximum height.

               4.4 Chapter 4 Summary and Review

               Key Concepts

                   1 We can use angles to describe rotation. Positive angles indicate rotation
                      in the counter-clockwise direction; negative angles describe clockwise
                      rotation.

                   2 We define the trigonometric ratios of any angle by placing the angle
                      in standard position and choosing a point on the terminal side, with
                      r = x2 + y2.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS                                  213

               The Trigonometric Ratios.

    If  is an angle in standard position, and (x, y) is a point on
its terminal side, with r = x2 + y2, then

          y                              x               y
sin  =                         cos  =          tan  =

          r                              r               x

3 To construct a reference triangle for an angle :

      1 Choose a point P on the terminal side.
      2 Draw a line from point P perpendicular to the x-axis.

4 The reference angle for  is the positive acute angle formed between
   the terminal side of  and the x-axis.

              P (x, y)                    P (x, y)

Third-quadrant: ~ =  - 180        Fourth-quadrant: ~ = 360 - 

5 The trigonometric ratios of any angle are equal to the ratios of its reference
   angle, except for sign. The sign of the ratio is determined by the quadrant.

6
             To find an angle  with a given reference angle :.

Quadrant I:    =                  Quadrant II:           = 180 - 
Quadrant III:    = 180 +          Quadrant IV:            = 360 - 

                = 180 - ~      y                = ~

                            ~               ~  x

                            ~               ~

                = 180 + ~                    = 360 - ~

7 There are always two angles between 0 and 360 (except for the quad-
   rantal angles) with a given trigonometric ratio.

8 Coterminal angles have equal trigonometric ratios.
CHAPTER 4. TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS  214

 9 To solve an equation of the form sin  = k, or cos  = k, or tan  = k,
    we can use the appropriate inverse trig key on a calculator to find one
    solution (or a coterminal angle.) We use reference angles to find a second
    solution between 0 and 360.

10
                                  Angles in a Unit Circle.

             Let P be a point on a unit circle determined by the terminal
         side of an angle  in standard position. Then the coordinates (x, y)
         of P are given by

                                    x = cos , y = sin 

11
                                          Coordinates.

             If point P is located at a distance r from the origin in the direc-
         tion specified by angle  in standard position, then the coordinates
         of P are

                                x = r cos  and y = r sin 

12 Navigational directions for ships and planes are sometimes given as
    bearings, which are angles measured clockwise from north.

13 Periodic functions are used to model phenomena that exhibit cyclical
    behavior.

14 The trigonometric ratios sin  and cos  are functions of the angle .

15 The period of the sine function is 360. Its midline is the horizontal
    line y = 0, and the amplitude of the sine function is 1.

16 The graph of the cosine function has the same period, midline, and
    amplitude as the graph of the sine function. However, the locations of
    the intercepts and of the maximum and minimum values are different.

17 We use the notation y = f (x) to indicate that y is a function of x, that
    is, x is the input variable and y is the output variable.

18 The tangent function has period 180. It is undefined at odd multiples of
    90, and is increasing on each interval of its domain.

19
                                    Angle of Inclination.

             The angle of inclination of a line is the angle  measured in
         the positive direction from the positive x-axis to the line. If the
         slope of the line is m, then

                                             tan  = m

         where 0    180.

                  Amplitude, Period, and Midline.

20 1 The graph of

                       y = A cos  or y = A sin 

   has amplitude |A|.
2 The graph of

                       y = cos B or y = sin B

has period        360  .

                  |B|

3 The graph of

                   y = k + cos  or y = k + sin 

has midline y = k.

                                                                            360
21 The graph of y = k + A sin B has amplitude A, period , and midline

                                                                              B
    y = k. The same is true for the graph of y = k + A cos B.

22 Functions that have graphs shaped like sines or cosines are called sinu-
    soidal.

23
                                      Periodic Function.

             The function y = f (x) is periodic if there is a smallest value
         of p such that

                                         f (x + p) = f (x)

         for all x. The constant p is called the period of the function.

5.1 Algebra with Trigonometric Ratios

In this chapter we apply some techniques from algebra to analyze more compli-
cated trigonometric expressions. Before we begin, let's review some algebraic
terminology.

                                     Algebra Refresher.

        · An algebraic expression is any meaningful collection of numbers,
            variables, and operation symbols. For example, the height of a
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                       222

   golf ball is given in feet by the expression -16t2 + 64t, where t is
   the number of seconds after the ball is hit.

· We evaluate an expression by substituting a specific value for the
   variable or variables involved. Thus, after 1 second, the height of
   the golf ball is

                    -16(1)2 + 64(11) = -16 + 64 = 48 feet

   and after 2 seconds, the height is

                    -16(2)2 + 64(2) = -64 + 128 = 64 feet

   and so on.

Evaluating Trigonometric Expressions

Trigonometric ratios represent numbers, and they may appear as part of an
algebraic expression. Expressions containing trig ratios can be simplified or
evaluated like other algebraic expressions.

Note 5.1 Keep in mind that sin(X), for example, is not a product: it does not
mean "sin times X" (whatever that might be). Instead, "sin" is the name of a
function, and sin(X) means to evaluate the sine function at X. Thus, sin(X) is
a single number, the output of the sine function.
Example 5.2 Evaluate each expression for X = 30 and Y = 135.

    a 2 tan(Y ) + 3 sin(X)

    b 6 tan(X) cos(Y )

Solution.
    a Substituting the values for X and Y , we get
                                       2 tan(135) + 3 sin(30)

Next, we evaluate each trig ratio and follow the order of operations.

                    2 tan(135) + 3 sin(30) = 2(-1) + 3( 1 )
                                                                       2

                                                                3 -1

                                                                22

Caution 5.4 In the previous Exercise, sin(3X + 45) is not equal to sin(3X) +
sin(45). That is,

                            sin(90 + 45) = sin(90) + sin(45)

(You can check this for yourself.) We must follow the order of operations and
evaluate the expression 3X + 45 inside parentheses before applying the sine
function.

Simplifying Trigonometric Expressions

Because expressions such as sin(x) and tan() are just variables, we can use
algebra skills to simplify expressions involving the trig functions. For the rest
of this section, we'll try to illustrate all the skills you will need going forward
with your study of trigonometry.

                       More Algebra.

    When we simplify an algebraic expression, we obtain a new expres-
sion that has the same values as the old one, but is easier to work with.
For example, we can apply the distributive law and combine like terms
to simplify

                  2x(x - 6) + 3(x + 2) = 2x2 - 12x + 3x + 6
                                              = 2x2 - 9x + 6

The new expression is equivalent to the old one, that is, the expressions
have the same value when we evaluate them at any value of x. For
instance, you can check that, at x = 3,

     2(3)(3 - 6) + 3(3 + 2) = 6(-3) + 3(5) = -3

and                    2(3)2 - 9(3) + 6 = 18 - 27 + 6 = -3

    To simplify an expression containing trig ratios, we treat each ratio as a
single variable. Compare the two calculations below:

8xy                    - 6xy      = 2xy

8 cos() sin() - 6 cos() sin() = 2 cos() sin()

Both calculations are examples of combining like terms. In the second cal-
culation, we treat cos() and sin() as variables, just as we treat x and y as
variables in the first calculation.

Example 5.5 Simplify.

a 3 tan(A) + 4 tan(A) - 2 cos(A)
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                       224

b 2 - sin(B) + 2 sin(B)

Solution.
    a Combine like terms.
                    3 tan(A) + 4 tan(A) - 2 cos(A) = 7 tan(A) - 2 cos(A)
       Note that tan(A) and cos(A) are not like terms.
    b Combine like terms.
                                2 - sin(B) + 2 sin(B) = 2 + sin(B)
       Note that - sin(B) is treated as - 1 · sin(B).

Checkpoint 5.6 Simplify 2 cos(t) - 4 cos(w) sin(w) + 3 cos(t) - 2 cos(w)
Answer. 5 cos(t) - 4 cos(w) sin(w) - 2 cos(w)
Caution 5.7 In the previous Checkpoint, note that cos(t) and cos(w) are not
like terms. (We can choose values for t and w so that cos(t) and cos(w) have
different values.)
Example 5.8 Simplify, and evaluate for z = 40.

                              3 sin(z) - sin(z) tan(z) + 3 sin(z)

Solution. We can combine like terms to get

                                    6 sin(z) - sin(z) tan(z)

Because 40 is not one of the angles for which we know exact trig values, we
use a calculator to evaluate the expression.

                  6 sin(40) - sin(40) tan(40) = 6(0.6428)(0.8391)
                                                          = 3.3174

Powers of Trigonometric Ratios

Compare the two expressions

                                                                   2

                                     cos() and cos(2)

They are not the same.

· The first expression,               2
   the result.
                         cos() , says to compute cos() and then square

· cos(2) says to square the angle first, and then compute the cosine.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                  225

For example, if  = 30, then

                                         2  2        3
                                            3
                       cos(30) =                  =
                                            2        4

           but  cos (302) = cos(900) = cos(180) = -1

    We usually write cos2() instead of cos() 2, to distinguish it from cos(2),
and to reduce the number of parentheses. Thus, cos2() means the square of

cos().

                       The square of cosine.

                       cos2() means                            2

                                                  cos()

The same notation applies to the other trig ratios, so that

                             2                                    2
           sin2() = sin() and tan2() = tan()

Example 5.10 Evaluate sin2(45).

           sin2(45) =                   2      12 1
Solution.                                   =
                       sin(45) =               2        2

  Other powers are written in the same fashion. Thus, for example, sin3() =

             3

sin() .

Checkpoint 5.11 Evaluate tan4(60)
Answer. 9

Products

We can multiply together trigonometric expressions, just as we multiply alge-

braic expressions. Recall that we use the distributive law in computing products

such as

                       x(3x - 2) = 3x2 - 2x

and
                               (x - 3)(x + 5) = x2 + 2x - 15

Example 5.12 Using the distributive law, multiply cos(t) 3 cos(t) - 2 .

Solution. Think of cos(t) as a single variable, and multiply by each term
inside parentheses. (The algebraic form of the calculation is shown below in
blue).

          cos(t) 3 cos(t) - 2 = cos(t) 3 cos(t) - cos(t) · 2
                                    = 3 cos2(t) - 2 cos(t)

                     x(3x - 2)= x · 3x - x · 2
                                    = 3x2 - 2x

                                                         2

Notice that we write cos(t) as cos2(t).
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                                   226

Checkpoint 5.13 Multiply 2 tan() 4 tan2() + tan()
Answer. 8 tan3() + 2 tan() tan()

    We can also use the distributive law to multiply binomials that include
trig ratios. You may have used the acronym F OIL to remember the four
multiplications in a product of binomials:

            F irst terms, Outside terms, Inside terms, and Last terms.

Example 5.14 Multiply 4 sin(C) - 1 3 sin(C) + 2 .
Solution. This calculation is similar to the product (4x - 1)(3x + 2), except
that the variable x has been replaced by sin(C). Compare the calculations for
the two products; first the familiar algebraic product:

               (4x - 1)(3x + 2) = 4x · 3x + 4x · 2 - 1 · 3x - 1 · 2
                                     = 12x2 + 8x - 3x - 2 = 12x2 + 5x - 2

We compute the product in this example in the same way, but replacing x by
sin(C ).

          4 sin(C) - 1 sin(C) + 2

             = 4 sin(C) 3 sin(C) + 4 sin(C) · 2 - 1 3 sin(C) - 1 · 2
             = 12 sin2(C) + 5 sin(C) - 2

                                                                                   2

Checkpoint 5.15 Expand 4 cos() + 3

Answer. 16 cos2() + 24 cos() + 9

Factoring

We can factor trigonometric expressions with the same techniques we use for
algebraic expressions. In the next two Examples, compare the familiar algebraic
factoring with a similar trigonometric expression.

Example 5.16 Factor.

a 6w2 - 9w               b 6 sin2() - 9 sin()

Solution.
    a We factor out the common factor, 3w.
                                       6w2 - 9w = 3w(2w - 3)

    b We factor out the common factor, 3 sin().
                           6 sin2() - 9 sin() = 3 sin() 2 sin() - 3

Answer.

a a(2a - b)                       b cos() 2 cos() - sin()

We can also factor quadratic trinomials.

Example 5.18 Factor.

a t2 - 3t - 10                    b tan2() - 3 tan() - 10

Solution.

a We look for numbers p and q so that (t + p)(t + q) = t2 - 3t - 10. We see

that their product must be pq = -10 , and their sum must be p + q = -3.

By checking the factors of -10 for the correct sum, we find p = -5 and

q = 2. Thus,

                           t2 - 3t - 10 = (t - 5)(t + 2)

b Now replace t by tan() to find

             tan2() - 3 tan() - 10 = tan() - 5 tan() + 2

Checkpoint 5.19 Factor.           b 3 sin2() - 2 sin() - 1

Concepts

    1 Expressions containing trig ratios can be simplified or evaluated like other
       algebraic expressions. To simplify an expression containing trig ratios, we
       treat each ratio as a single variable.

    2 sin(X + Y ) is not equal to sin(X) + sin(Y ) (and the same holds for
       the other trig ratios). Remember that the parentheses indicate function
       notation, not multiplication.

    3 We write cos2() to denote (cos 9)2, and cosn() to denote (cos())n.
       (Similarly for the other trig ratios.)

    4 We can factor trigonometric expressions with the same techniques we use
       for algebraic expressions.

5.2 Solving Equations

Introduction

Now that we understand that trigonometric functions can be used to model
rotations and cyclical behavior, we can begin to consider some applications.
An important part of any model involves solving equations. In Chapter 4 we
solved simple trigonometric equations, and now we are equipped to tackle more
challenging ones.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES  232

                                     Algebra Refresher.

         It is important to distinguish between an algebraic expression and an
    equation. An equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are
    equal. It may be true or false, depending on the values of any variables
    involved. Here are some examples of equations.

                                     5(2 + 6) = 5(2) + 5(6)
                                       32 + 42 = 3 + 4
                                      x2 + 3x = 10

    The first equation is true, the second is false, and the third equation is
    true only if x = 2 or x = -5. When you solve an equation, you are
    finding the values of the variable that make the equation true.

    You already know several algebraic techniques for solving equations of
different types. But sometimes simple trial and error is the best approach.
Example 5.20

    a Evaluate 2x + 3 x - 1 for x = 9.
    b Solve 2x + 3 x - 1 = 20.

Solution.

    a Substitute x = 9 into the expression to find
                                   2x + 3 x - 1 = 2(9) + 3 9 - 1
                                                     = 18 + 3 8 = 20

    b We must find a value for x that makes 2x + 3 x - 1 equal to 20. In part
       (a) we saw that this expression equals 20 when x = 9, so the solution of
       the equation 2x + 3 x - 1 = 20 is x = 9.

Checkpoint 5.21 Use trial and error to find a solution of the equation

                                       2x3 - 4x = 5x2 - 3

Hint. Try small integer values for x.
Answer. x = 3

    Another useful equation-solving method uses graphs.
Example 5.22 Use a graph to solve the equation x3 - 2x2 - 5x = -6.
Solution. We graph the expressions on either side of the equation, that is,
we graph y = x3 - 2x2 - 5x and y = -6 on the same grid, as shown below.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                            233

We are looking for any values of x where the                 y
two y-values are equal, and these occur at
the intersection points of the two graphs. At             4                 x
those points, the x-values are x = -2, x = 1                    24
and x = 3, and these are the solutions of      -4 -2
the equation. You can check that all three              -4
values make the equation true.                          -8
                                                      -12

Checkpoint 5.23 Use a graph to show that the equation x2 - 2x + 4 = 0 has
no real-valued solutions.
Answer.

                                                                                             y
                                                                                            8

The graph does not cross the line y = 0.            4

Trigonometric Equations

  The first Ferris wheel was built for the
  Chicago World's Fair in 1893. It had a
  diameter of 250 feet and could carry 2160
  people in 36 carriages. From the top of the
  wheel, passengers could see into four states.
  After loading all the passengers, the wheel
  made one revolution in nine minutes.

    If you are in the bottom carriage of the Ferris wheel at the start of its
revolution, your height after t seconds is given by

                                                                  2t
                               h = f (t) = 139 - 125 cos

                                                                   3

For how long are you more than 240 feet above the ground?

Note 5.24 In case you are wondering, the boarding platform is 14 feet above
the ground, so that h = 14 when t = 0. And notice that 2t = 360 when

                                                                                 3
t = 540 seconds, or 9 minutes.

    The figure below shows a graph of the height function and a horizontal line
at h = 240.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                      234

                                 h
                            300

                            250

                            200

                            150

                            100

                             50

                                      60 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 540 t

    From the graph, we see that h = 240 at approximately 215 seconds (or 3
minutes and 35 seconds) and 325 seconds (or 5 minutes and 25 seconds) into
the ride. Your height is more than 240 feet between those two times, or for
about 110 seconds.

Solving Trigonometric Equations

In the example above, we used a graph to solve the equation h = 240, or

139 - 125 cos                          2t   = 240

                                       3

To find a more precise solution, we can use algebraic methods. To start, we'll
solve the slightly simpler equation

                                    139 - 125 cos() = 240

We'll look for all solutions for  between 0 and 360. We begin by isolating
the trigonometric ratio on one side of the equation.

139 - 125 cos() = 240                  Subtract 139 from both sides.
     -125 cos() = 101                  Divide both sides by -125.
             cos() = -0.808

We have solved equations like this one before: we use the inverse cosine to solve
for . Remember that there are two angles between 0 and 360 that have a
cosine of -0.808, one in the second quadrant and one in the third quadrant.
The calculator will give us only the second quadrant solution.

                                  = cos-1(-0.808) = 143.9

To find the second solution, we need the third-quadrant angle whose cosine is
-0.808.

Now, the reference angle for 143.9 is       143.9
              180 - 143.9 = 36.1

and the angle in the third quadrant with                 36.1
the same reference angle is                              36.1

              180 + 36.1 = 216.1

(See the figure at right.) Thus, the other  216.1
solution is 216.1.

To solve simple equations involving a single trigonometric ratio (either

sin(), cos(), or tan()), we can follow the steps below.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                     235

  To Solve a Trigonometric Equation for 0    360.

1 Isolate the trigonometric ratio.
2 Find one solution.

      a Give an exact solution if the trig ratio is one of the special
         values.

      b Otherwise use the inverse trig keys on a calculator.
3 Use reference angles to find a second solution (if there is one).

Note 5.25 In step 3, note that if the first solution is a quadrantal angle, there

may not be a second solution. Consider, for example, the equation cos() = -1.

Our estimates from the graphical solutions were pretty good.

Example 5.26 Solve the equation 8 sin() - 1 = 3 for 0    360.

Solution. We begin by isolating the trig ratio.

8 sin() - 1 = 3                          Add 1 to both sides.

8 sin() = 4                              Divide both sides by 8.

the special angles, namely  = 30 , and              3          3
also for the obtuse angle  = 150, as

shown at right.

    We know that  = 150 is the second-quadrant angle with reference angle =
30. What about the other quadrants? Because the sine is negative in the third
and fourth quadrants, there are no other solutions between 0 and 360. The
solutions we want are  = 30 and  = 150.

Caution 5.27 Be careful! It is worth repeating that to solve a trigonometric
equation, it is not enough to find one solution; we must find all the solutions
between 0 and 360. To find the solutions in other quadrants, we use reference
angles.

    In the previous Example, we found two solutions of the equation 8 sin()-1 =
3. The equation actually has infinitely many solutions, as you can see in the
figure below, which shows a graph of y = 8 sin() - 1 and the horizontal line
y = 3. The line intersects the sine graph infinitely many times, twice in each
cycle.

    Each intersection represents a solution of the equation. Thus, all of the
angles coterminal with 30 and 150 are also solutions. We can easily find these
solutions by adding integer multiples of 360 to 30 or 150. This is why, when
solving a trigonometric equation, we usually list only the solutions in one cycle,
typically those between 0 and 360.

Checkpoint 5.28 Solve the equation 5 tan() + 7 = 2 for 0    360.
Answer.  = 135 and  = 315

    We can use a calculator to help us solve equations that do not involve special
angles.

Example 5.29 Solve the equation 3 tan() + 1 = -8 for 0    360.
Round your solutions to three decimal places.

Solution. First, we isolate the trig ratio.

                                   3 tan() + 1 = -8
                                        3 tan() = -9
                                          tan() = -3

There are two angles with tangent -3, one in the          r
second quadrant and one in the fourth quadrant.       3
The calculator finds the solution
                                                              1
                  tan-1(-3) = -71.565                     1

This angle is in the fourth quadrant, but it is not               3
between 0 and 360.                                           r

The angle we want is coterminal with -71.565, so we add 360 to get the

first solution:

                 B = tan-1(-3) + 360 = 288.435

    The other solution is in the second quadrant, as shown in the figure. This
angle is 180 less than the fourth quadrant solution:

                 B = tan-1(-3) + 180 = 108.435

Note 5.30 In the previous Example, notice that the solutions are 180 apart.
The solutions of an equation tan() = k always differ by 180, so the use of
reference angles is not necessary for these equations: once we have found one
solution, we can add or subtract 180 to find the other solution between 0 and
360. (See Homework Problems 69 and 70.)

Checkpoint 5.31 Solve the equation 4 cos(C) - 6 = -3, for 0    360.
Round your solutions to three decimal places.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                 237

Answer. C = 41.410 or C = 318.590
    Some trigonometric equations have no solution. As we can observe from

their graphs or from their definitions, the sine and cosine functions only have
values ranging from -1 to 1.

Example 5.32 Solve sin() - 3 = 1 for 0    360.
                                   5

Solution. We begin by isolating sin().

sin()                Add 3 to both sides.
         -3=1        Multiply both sides by 5.

The equation has no solution.

Answer. No solution

Graphical Solutions

Sometimes it is helpful to have a visual image of an equation, and we can use
graphs to find approximate solutions.

Example 5.34 Use a graph to solve the equation 3 tan(B) + 1 = -8.

Solution. Graph the equation y = 3 tan(B) + 1 and the horizontal line
y = -8 on the same axes, as shown below.

    It is difficult to read the graph with much accuracy, but you can use the
intersect feature on your calculator to verify that the graph of y = 3 tan(B)+1
has y-value -8 when B is about 108.4 or 288.4.

Equations with Squares of Trig Ratios

You know several techniques for solving quadratic equations. Simple quadratic
equations can be solved by extracting roots. For example, to solve the equation

                                           4x2 + 3 = 15

we first isolate x2:

                                             4x2 = 12
                                               x2 = 3

and then take square roots of both sides to find
                                              

                                      x = ± 3  ±1.732

Recall that a quadratic equation may have two real solutions, one (repeated)
real solution, or no real solutions. We can use extraction of roots to solve
trigonometric equations as well.

Example 5.36 Solve 4 tan2() + 3 = 15 for 0    360.
Solution. We begin by isolating the power of tangent, tan2 .

                                          4 tan2() = 12
                                            tan2() = 3

Next, we solve for tan() by extracting roots.
                                                         

                                          tan() = ± 3
There are two angles between 0 and 360 with tangent 3 and two angles
with tangent - 3, making four solutions to this equation. We know that
tan(60) = 3, so one of the solutions is 60.

The tangent function is also positive in the third     120         60
quadrant, and the angle in the third quadrant
with reference angle 60 is 180 + 60 = 240.               60        60
The angles in the second and fourth quadrants            60        60
with reference angle 60 have tangent - 3.              240         300
These angles are

180 - 60 = 120 and 360 - 60 = 300

The four solutions are shown at right.

Checkpoint 5.37 Solve the equation 2 sin2() = 1 for 0    360.

Answer.  = 45,  = 135,  = 225 , or  = 315

Other quadratic equations can be solved by factoring. For example, we can

solve the equation

                    4x2 + 4x - 3 = 0

by factoring the left side to get

                    (2x + 3)(2x - 1) = 0

Then we apply the Zero Factor Principle to set each factor equal to zero, and
solve each equation.

2x + 3 = 12                                            2x - 1 = 0

The solutions are and .
            2  2

Example 5.38 Solve 2 cos2() - cos() - 1 = 0 for 0    360.

Solution. Compare this equation to the algebraic equation 2x2 - x - 1 = 0.
Our equation has the same algebraic form, but with x replaced by cos().

    We can solve the algebraic equation by factoring 2x2 -x-1 as (2x+1)(x-1),
and we'll use the same strategy on the trigonometric equation.

2 cos2() - cos() - 1 = 0     Factor the left side.

2 cos() + 1 cos() - 1 = 0    Set each factor equal to zero.

cos() =  -1    or cos() = 1

         2

Now we solve each equation for . We know that cos(60) = 1 , and the cosine
                                                                                2

function is negative in the second and third quadrants. The angles in those
quadrants with reference angle 60 are

         180 - 60 = 120 and 180 + 60 = 240

Also, cos() = 1 when  = 0. Thus, the original equation has three solutions:
 = 120,  = 240, and  = 0.

Snell's Law

When you view an object through a liquid, such
as a spoon in a glass of water, or a fish in
an aquarium, the object may look distorted or
bent. This distortion is caused by refraction of
light. Light rays bend when they pass from one
medium to another, for instance from water to
glass or from glass to air.

    A light ray enters the boundary between the two media at a certain angle,
called the angle of incidence, but leaves the boundary at a different angle,
the angle of refraction. Both angles are acute angles measured from the
normal line perpendicular to the boundary, as shown below.

The change of angle is caused by the fact that    water    normal line
light travels at different speeds in different      1              2
media. The relationship between the angle of
incidence and the angle of refraction is given
by Snell's Law:

                    sin(1) = v1 glass
                    sin(2) v2

    where 1 is the angle in the medium where light travels at speed v1, and 2
is the angle where light travels at speed v2. The ratio of the speeds is called
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                             240

the index of refraction.

Example 5.40 The index of refraction from water to glass is 1.1. If light
passes from water to glass with a 23 angle of incidence, what is the angle of
refraction?

Solution. If  is the angle of refraction, then from Snell's Law we have

sin(23)                          Multiply both sides by sin().
           = 1.1                 Divide both sides by 1.1.

 sin()

sin(23) = 1.1 sin()

sin() =  sin(23)       = 0.3552

         1.1

Because sin() = 0.3552,  = sin-1(0.3552) = 20.8. (For Snell's Law we use
only acute angles.) The angle of refraction is approximately 20.8.

incidence. What is the angle of refraction?

5.3 Trigonometric Identities

What is an Identity?

Recall that an equation may be true or false, depending on the values of any
variables involved. For example, the equation

                                           x2 + 3x = 10

is true only if x = 2 or x = 5. An equation that is true only for certain values
of the variable, and false for others, is called a conditional equation. When
you solve a conditional equation, you are finding the values of the variable that
make the equation true.

    Some equations are true for all legitimate values of the variables. Such
equations are called identities. Here are some examples of identities.

                                    3(x + y) = 3x + 3y
                                    (x + 1)2 = x2 + 2x + 1

In an identity, the expressions on either side of the equal sign are equivalent
expressions, because they have the same value for all values of the variable.
When we simplify an algebraic expression, we are in fact creating an identity.

                                             Identity.

         An identity is an equation that is true for all legitimate values of
    the variables.

Example 5.42 Which of the following equations are identities?

    a 3s + 7s = 10s
    b 5c(c - 2s) = 5c2 - 10cs

    c 2t - 1 = 3

Solution. Many of the algebraic operations you have already learned, such
as combining like terms or applying the distributive law, produce equivalent
expressions.

    a Equation (a) is an identity obtained by combining like terms on the left
       side.

    b Equation (b) is an identity obtained by applying the distributive law on
       the left side.

    c Equation (c) is not an identity, because the equation is true only for t = 2.

Checkpoint 5.43 Which of the following equations are identities?
    a (c - s)(c + s) = c2 - s2
    b 3t2 = 1
    c (2c + 1) + (s - 3) = 2c + s - 2

Answer. (a) and (c)
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                               245

    Of course, you wouldn't be asked to solve an identity, because all values
of the variable are solutions. Instead, we use identities to replace one form of
an expression by a more useful form. You do this when you solve a quadratic
equation by factoring. For example,

    2x2 - x - 1 = 0  Factor the left side.
(2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0

Because (2x + 1)(x - 1) is equivalent to 2x2 - x - 1, we have not changed the
equation or its solutions. But now we can apply the Zero Factor principle and
solve the equation.

    Using identities is especially useful when we are working with trigonometric
ratios.

Using Trigonometric Ratios in Identities

Because the identity
                               2x2 - x - 1 = (2x + 1)(x - 1)

is true for any value of x, it is true when x is replaced, for instance, by cos().
This gives us a new identity

                 2 cos2() - cos() - 1 = 2 cos() + 1 cos() - 1

Expressions involving sin(), cos(), or tan() can be manipulated by the same
rules (such as the distributive law or the laws of exponents) that we use with
simple variables.
Example 5.44 Which of the following equations are identities?

    a 3 sin() + 7 sin() = 10 sin()

                                                                                      2

    b 5 cos() cos() - 2 sin() = 5 cos() - 10 cos() sin()

    c 2 tan() - 1 = 3

Solution. These equations are obtained from the equations in the previous
Example by replacing the variable s with sin(), the variable c with cos(), and
the variable t with tan(). Equations (a) and (b) are identities, for the same
reasons as before, and equation (c) is not. It is false, for example, when  = 0.

Checkpoint 5.45 Which of the following equations are identities?
    a cos() - sin() cos() + sin() = cos2() - sin2()
    b 3 tan2() = 1
    c 2 cos() + 1 + sin() - 3 = 2 cos() + sin() - 2

Answer. (a) and (c)

Caution 5.46 To show that an equation is not an identity, we need only find
one value of the variable for which the equation is false. However, to show that
a given equation is an identity, it is not enough to show that the equation is
true for one or even a dozen values of the variable. The equation must be true
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                 246

for all legitimate values of the variable. Because we cannot check all values
of the variable numerically, we must use algebraic methods to prove that an
equation is an identity.

Checking Identities Graphically

                     
Is the equation x2 = x an identity? The answer is no! Even though the

equation is true for all positive values of x, it is false for negative values of x.

For example, if x = -3, then                          
                                           (-3)2 = 9 = 3
                                     x2 =

so x2 = x. Because the radical symbol  stands for the nonnegative square
                                                                    
root, the left side of the equation, x2, is never negative. Therefore, x2

cannot equal x when x is a negative number. The equation is false for x < 0.
    One way to see that x2 and x are not equivalent is to compare the graphs

of Y1 = x2 and Y2 = x, shown below. You can see that x2 and x do not

have the same value for x < 0.

                                             Y2 = x
Y1 = x2

    Thus, to check to whether an equation is an identity, we can compare graphs
of Y1 = (left side of the equation) and Y2 = (right side of the equation). If the
two graphs are identical, the equation is an identity. If the two graphs are not
the same, the equation is not an identity.

Example 5.47 Which of the following equations are identities?

a sin(2) = 2 sin()                           b cos(x + 1) = cos(x)

Solution.

    a Compare the graphs of Y1 = sin(2x) and Y2 = 2 sin(x). Enter the two
       equations in the ZTrig window and press ZOOM 7 to see the graphs shown
       below.

   To help distinguish which graph is which, we can use the calculator's
   trace feature, illustrated in the figure at right. Because there are two
   distinct graphs, the expressions sin(2x) and 2 sin(x) are not equivalent,
   and consequently sin(2) = 2 sin() is not an identity.

b This time we graph Y1 = cos(x + 1) and Y2 = cos(x). Although the graphs
   appear to be identical, when we use the trace feature we see that their
   y-values differ at x = 0 (and at many other values of x.) See the figures
   below.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES  247

       The graphs are so close together that calculator's resolution does not
       distinguish them, but tracing the graphs reveals that they are not identical.
       Because the two graphs differ, the equation cos(x + 1) = cos(x) is not an
       identity.

Caution 5.48

   · The Example above illustrates the fact that graphs can be deceiving:
       even if two graphs look identical, it is always a good idea to check some
       numerical values as well.

   · Remember that we can use graphs to prove that an equation is not an
       identity, if the two graphs are clearly different, but to prove that an
       equation is an identity, we will need algebraic methods.

Checkpoint 5.49 Use graphs to decide which of the following equations are
identities.

    a cos(2) = 2 cos()

    b cos(2) = cos2() - sin2()

    c cos(2) = cos2()

Answer. (b)

Pythagorean Identity

All of the trigonometric functions are related. This is plausible when you think
about it, because the three trig ratios all involve the three sides of a right
triangle. Taking advantage of these relationships will simplify many calculations
involving the trig functions.

    We'll begin by considering the relationship between sin() and cos(). Com-
plete the following table with exact values.

                         cos() sin() cos2() sin2() cos2() + sin2()
                        0
                        30
                        45
                        60
                        90

    You should find that all the entries in the last column are 1.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                248

For all of the angles in the table,
                 cos2() + sin2() = 1

We can verify that this equation holds for all
angles by graphing the expressions on either
side of the equal sign. The graphs of these two
functions in the ZTrig window are shown at
right.

    We see that the graph of Y1 = cos2() + sin2() appears identical to the
horizontal line Y2 = 1. In fact, the graphs are identical, and the equation
cos2() + sin2() = 1 is an identity. It is important enough to earn a special
name.

                                   Pythagorean Identity.

For any angle ,

                 cos2() + sin2() = 1

    As you might guess from its name, the Pythagorean identity is true because
it is related to the Pythagorean theorem. We have not actually proved the
identity, and a skeptical student may wonder if cos2() + sin2() is only very
close to 1, or if it equals 1 for only some values of . Homework Problem 77
offers a proof of the Pythagorean identity.

Example 5.50 Evaluate cos2(27) + sin2(27) without using a calculator.
Solution. Because the identity cos2() + sin2() = 1 is true for any value of
, it is true in particular for  = 27. So cos2(27) + sin2(27) = 1.

Checkpoint 5.51 Evaluate 5 cos2(12) + sin2(12) without using a
calculator.

Answer. 5
    When we solve more complicated trigonometric equations in later chapters,

we will need to simplify trigonometric expressions so that they involve only
one of the trig functions. The Pythagorean identity is useful when we wish to
write an equivalent expression for either cos2() or for sin2(). Note that we
can write the identity in two alternate forms:

                 Alternate Forms of the Pythagorean Identity.

                 cos2()= 1 - sin2()
                 sin2()= 1 - cos2()

Example 5.52 Rewrite sin() cos2() as an expression involving sin() only.

Solution. Using one of the alternate forms of the Pythagorean identity, we
replace cos2() by 1 - sin2() to get

sin()cos2() = sin()(1 - sin2())       Apply the distributive law.
                   = sin() - sin3()
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                          249

    In the previous Example, we have shown that
                              sin() cos2() = sin() - sin3()

is an identity.

If we graph
           Y1 = sin(X) cos2(X)
           Y2 = sin(X) - sin3(X)

    for - 360  X  360, we see that they have the same graph, as shown
in the figure.
Checkpoint 5.53

    a Rewrite sin2() cos2() as an expression in cos().
    b Verify your identity by graphing.

Answer. cos2() - cos4()

Tangent Identity

There is also a relationship between the tangent ratio and the sine and cosine.
Complete the following table with exact values. You should find that the entries
in the last two columns are identical.

 cos() sin()                  sin()              tan()

                              cos()

0

30

45

60

For the angles in the table,

                                          sin()
                              tan() =

                                          cos()

Because cos(90) = 0, the quotient sin() is undefined for  = 90, and tan 90
                                              cos()

is undefined, too. The same is true for  = 270. For all other angles between

0 and 360, tan() = sin() . A proof of the tangent identity is outlined in
                               cos()

Homework Problem 78.

                             Tangent Identity.
For any angle not coterminal with 90 or 270,

                                sin()
                  tan() =

                                cos()

    Now we can see how to use identities to simplify trigonometric expressions.
One strategy for simplifying a trigonometric expression is to reduce the number
of different trig ratios involved. We can use the tangent identity to replace the
tangent ratio by sines and cosines.

All three of the trigonometric functions of an angle are related. If we know the
value of one of the three, we can calculate the other two (up to sign) by using
the Pythagorean and tangent identities. We do not need to find the angle itself
in order to do this. We need only know in which quadrant the angle lies to
determine the correct sign for the trig ratios.

                                       7  and 90 <  < 180 , find cos() and tan().
Example 5.56 If sin() =
                             25

Solution. We substitute sin() = 7 into the Pythagorean identity cos2()+
                                               25

sin2() = 1 to get

cos2() +   72                             Isolate cos2().
                  =1

           25

           cos2() = 1 -      72           1-         2
                             25
                                              257 = 1 - 625 49 = 625 625-49

           cos2() = 576                   Take square roots.
                        625

                          576
           cos  = ±

                          625
                       24
                 =±
                       25

Because  is between 90 and 180, cos() must be negative, so cos() = -24 .
                                                                                                  25

To find tan(), we use the tangent identity.

                                          sin() 7/25 -7
           tan() =                        =   =
                                          cos() -24/25 24

    We can also work the previous Example by sketching an appropriate triangle.

We begin by drawing an obtuse angle  and its reference triangle. Because
            7

sin() = , we can choose a point on the terminal side to have y-coordinate 7
            25

and r = 25, as shown below. In order to calculate cos() and tan(), we must

find the x-coordinate of the point. By the Pythagorean theorem,
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                                         251

      x2 + 72 = 252               Isolate x2.                     (x, 7)
            x2 = 576              Take square roots.           7 25 
             x = -24

     Note that x is negative because the point (x, 7) is in the second quadrant.

Then                x -24                                      y 7 -7

           cos() = =                        and tan() = =                    =
                    r 25                                       x -24 24

Solving Equations

Now we'll see how identities are useful for solving trigonometric equations. So
far we have only solved equations that involve a single trigonometric ratio. If
the equation involves more than one trig function, we use identities to rewrite
the equation in terms of a single trig function.

Example 5.58 Solve cos2(A) - sin2(A) - sin(A) = 0 for 0  A  360.

Solution. The equation involves both the cosine and sine functions, and we
will rewrite the left side in terms of the sine only. To eliminate the cosines, we
use the Pythagorean identity cos2(A) = 1 - sin2(A).

       cos2(A) - sin2(A) - sin(A) = 0               Replace cos2(A) by 1 - sin2(A).
(1 - sin2(A)) - sin2(A) - sin(A) = 0                Combine like terms.
                                                    Multiply both sides by - 1.
             1 - 2 sin2(A) - sin(A) = 0             Factor the left side.
             2 sin2(A) + sin(A) - 1 = 0
        (2 sin(A) - 1)(sin(A) + 1) = 0

Set  each  factor   equal     to  zero  to  see  that  either  sin(A)  =  1  or  sin(A)  =  -1.
                                                                          2
                 1                   30             150,                                   270.
Now,  sin(A)  =  2  when      A   =      or  A   =        and  sin(A)  =  -1  when  A  =

The solutions are A = 30, A = 150, or A = 270.

Checkpoint 5.59 Solve 1 - sin2() + cos() = 0 for 0    360.
Answer. 90, 180, 270

    Like the Pythagorean identity, the tangent identity can be helpful in solving
trigonometric equations.
Example 5.60 Solve cos(B) + 3 sin(B) = 0 for 0  B  360.

Solution. We first try to write the equation in terms of a single trig function.

                                                                                         
        3 sin(B) = - cos(B)                 Divide both sides by cos(B) and 3.

           sin(B) -1                        Apply the tangent identity.
                     =

           cos(B) 3
                        -1

           tan(B) =

Because tan(30 ) =  , we see that B has a                          3
                                                             3    30

reference angle of 30. And because the tangent
is negative in the second and fourth quadrants,
we have B = 150 or B = 330, as shown in the
figure.

Proving Identities

When we show that one trigonometric expression is equivalent to another
expression, we have proved a trigonometric identity. In a previous example we
proved that the equation

cos() tan() + sin() = 2 sin()

is an identity; it is true for all values of . A common strategy for proving an
identity is to transform one side of the equation using equivalent expressions
until it is identical to the other side. To help us choose the transformations at
each step of the proof, we try to match the algebraic form of the final expression.

Example 5.62 Prove the identity 1 + tan2(t) = cos21(t)

Solution. By manipulating the left side of the equation, we will show that
the expression 1 + tan2(t) is equivalent to cos21(t) . First, we use the tangent
identity to write the expression in terms of sines and cosines:

                       2           sin(t) 2             sin2(t)
1 + tan (t) = 1 +                            =1+ 2
                                   cos(t)               cos (t)

Next, we notice that the right side of the proposed identity has only one term,
so we combine the terms on the left side. So that the fractions have the same

                                     cos2(t)
denominator, we write 1 as cos2(t) .

sin2(t) cos2(t) sin2(t) cos2(t) + sin2(t)
1 + cos2(t) = cos2(t) + cos2(t) =
                                                        cos2(t)

Finally, we apply the Pythagorean identity to the numerator.

                          cos2(t) + sin2(t)      1
                                             = cos2(t)
                          cos2(t)

Thus, 1 + tan2(t) = cos21(t) , and the identity is proved.

    When you write out the proof of an identity, you should transform the
expression on one side of the identity into the expression on the other side,
showing one step of the calculation on each line of your proof. You can provide
a justification for each step to the right of the calculation. The proof of the
identity in the previous example would look like this:

1 + tan2(t) = 1 + sin(t) 2                   Replace tan(t) by   sin(t)  .
                          cos(t)
                                                                 cos(t)
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                       253

                      sin2(t)          Square the fraction.
              = 1 + cos2(t)                              cos2(t)

                 cos2(t) sin2(t)       Replace 1 by cos2(t) .
              = cos2(t) + cos2(t)      Add fractions.

                 cos2(t) + sin2(t)     Apply Pythagorean identity.
              = cos2(t)

                     1
              = cos2(t)

Checkpoint 5.63 Prove the identity 2 cos2(x) - 1 = 1 - 2 sin2(x)

Answer. 2 cos2(x) - 1 = 2 1 - sin2(x) = 2 - 2 sin2(x) - 1 = 1 - 2 sin2(x)

Concepts

    1 An equation that is true only for certain values of the variable, and false
       for others, is called a conditional equation. An equation that is true
       for all legitimate values of the variables is called an identity.

    2 The expressions on either side of the equal sign in an identity are called
       equivalent expressions, because they have the same value for all values
       of the variable.

    3 We often use identities to replace one form of an expression by a more
       useful form.
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                         254

4 To check to whether an equation is an identity we can compare graphs of
   Y1 = (left side of the equation) and Y2 = (right side of the equation). If
   the two graphs agree, the equation is an identity. If the two graphs are
   not the same, the equation is not an identity.

5.4 Chapter 5 Summary and Review

Key Concepts

    1 Expressions containing trig ratios can be simplified or evaluated like other
       algebraic expressions. To simplify an expression containing trig ratios, we
       treat each ratio as a single variable.

2 The parentheses in an expression such as sin(X + Y ) indicate function
   notation, not multiplication.

                                                                        2               n

3 We write cos2  to denote cos() , and cosn() to denote                    cos() .
  (Similarly for the other trig ratios.)

4 An equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. It
   may be true or false.

5 We can solve equations by trial and error, by using graphs, or by algebraic
   techniques.

6 To solve a trigonometric equation, we first isolate the trigonometric ratio

   on one side of the equation. We then use reference angles to find all the
   solutions between 0 and 360.

7 An equation that is true only for certain values of the variable, and false
   for others, is called a conditional equation. An equation that is true
   for all legitimate values of the variables is called an identity.

8 The expressions on either side of the equal sign in an identity are called
   equivalent expressions, because they have the same value for all values
   of the variable.

9 We often use identities to replace one form of an expression by a more
   useful form.

10 To check to whether an equation is an identity we can compare graphs of
    Y1 = (left side of the equation) and Y2 = (right side of the equation). If
    the two graphs agree, the equation is an identity. If the two graphs are
    not the same, the equation is not an identity.

11
                                   Pythagorean Identity.

For any angle ,

                 cos2() + sin2() = 1
CHAPTER 5. EQUATIONS AND IDENTITIES                                              259

    Alternate forms:

                             cos2() = 1 - sin2()
                             sin2() = 1 - cos2()

12
                                       Tangent Identity.

             For any angle not coterminal with 90 or 270,

                                                      sin()
                                         tan() =

                                                      cos()

13 To solve an equation involving more than one trig function, we use
    identities to rewrite the equation in terms of a single trig function.

14 To prove an identity, we write one side of the equation in equivalent forms
    until it is identical to the other side of the equation.

    Have you ever wonderd why we divide the circle into 360 degrees? Nobody
really knows the answer, but it may well have started around 600 BCE with
the Babylonians.
The Babylonians lived between the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers in present day Turkey and
Syria. They kept written records using a stylus
to press cuneiform, or wedge-shaped, symbols
into wet clay tablets, which were then baked
in the sun. Thousands of these tablets have
survived and give us detailed information about
the mathematical practices of the time.
The Babylonians used a base 60 number system
because the number 60 has many factors. They
did not invent decimal fractions, so they found
it difficult to deal with remainders when doing
division. But 60 can be divided evenly by 2,
3, 4, 5, and 6, which made calculations with
common fractions much easier.

    We still see traces of their base 60 system in our own day: there are 60
seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour.
In geometry, Babylonian mathematicians used
the corner of an equilateral triangle as their basic
unit of angular measure, and naturally divided
that angle into 60 smaller angles. Now, if the
corners of six equilateral triangles are placed
together they form a complete circle, and that
is why there are six times 60, or 360 degrees of
arc in a circle.

    During the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, using the tools and technology available

                                                 263
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                               264

to them, Babylonian astronomers calculated that a complete year numbered
360 days. This made dividing the circle into 360 degrees even more useful.

    So the number 360 is not fundamental to the nature of a circle. If ancient
civilizations had defined the full circle to be some other number of degrees,
we'd probably be using that number today.

    But why do we need another, different way to measure angles? In this
chapter we'll study radian measure, which at first may seem awkward and
unnatural. As a hint, consider that although 360 is not fundamental to circles,
the number  is.

01234567

01234567                        Imagine a circle of radius 1unit
                                rolling along a straight line. The
01234567                        circumference of a circle is 2 times
                                the length of its radius, so when
                                the circle has turned through one
01234567                        complete revolution, it has traveled
                       2        a distance of 2 units. When the
                                circle has turned through half a rev-
                                olution, it has taveled a distance of
                                 units.
                                In radian measure, the angle
                                through which the circle has turned
                                is equal to the distance the circle
                                has traveled, or the length of the
                                arc that has unrolled on the line.
                                The idea of radian measure was de-
                                veloped by Roger Cotes, an English
                                mathematician who worked closely
                                with Isaac Newton. He described
                                the radian in everything but name,
                                and recognized its naturalness as a
                                unit of angular measure.
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                                              265

    The term radian first appeared in print on June 5, 1873, on an exam
written by James Thomson, the brother of Lord Kelvin, at Queen's College in
Belfast.

    In calculus and most other branches of mathematics beyond practical
geometry, angles are nearly always measured in radians. Because radians arise
naturally when dealing with circles, important relationships are expressed more
concisely in radians. In particular, results involving trigonometric functions are
simpler when the variables are expressed in radians.

6.1 Arclength and Radians

Imagine that you are riding on a Ferris wheel   = 180           = 90
of radius 100 feet, and each rotation takes    p = 50          p = 25
eight minutes. We can use angles in stan-      t=4             t=2
dard position to describe your location as
you travel around the wheel. The figure                                    = 0
at right shows the locations indicated by                                 p=0
 = 0, 90, 180, and 270. But degrees                                       t=0
are not the only way to specify location on
a circle.                                                       = 270
                                                               p = 75
                                                               t=6

    We could use percent of one complete rotation and label the same locations
by p = 0, p = 25, p = 50, and p = 75. Or we could use the time elapsed, so
that for this example we would have t = 0, t = 2, t = 4, and t = 6 minutes.

    Another useful method to describe your location uses the distance traveled,
or arclength, along the circle. How far have you traveled around the Ferris
wheel at each of the locations shown?

    Before we consider that question, let's agree on some vocabulary. An arc is a
portion of a circle, and its length, quite naturally, is called arclength. An angle
with vertex at the center of the circle is called a central angle, and a central
angle whose sides meet the endpoints of an arc is said to subtend the arc.
Or we may say that the angle spans the arc. If the arc represents a distance
traveled, we sometimes refer to such an angle as the angle of displacement.

Arclength

Recall that the circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius,

                    C = 2r

If we walk around the entire circumference of a circle, the distance we travel is
2 times the length of the radius, or about 6.28 times the radius. If we walk
only part of the way around the circle, then the distance we travel depends also
on the angle of displacement.

For example, an angle of 45 is                             B   s = 4 r (or 18
1                                                      18 rev  circumference)

to point B, called s in the figure

               8

Thus
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                                           266

                                8          4

Similarly, the angle of displacement

                             3
from point A to point C is of
                                        4

                                4          2

In general, for a given circle the length of the arc spanned by an angle is

proportional to the size of the angle.

                          Arclength on a Circle.

Arclength = (fraction of one revolution) · (2r)

The Ferris wheel in the introduction has circumference

                          C = 2(100) = 628 feet

so in half a revolution you travel 314 feet around the edge, and in one-quarter
revolution you travel 157 feet.

To indicate the same four locations on the                       s = 157
wheel by distance traveled, we would use                   r = 100 s = 0

   s = 0, s = 157, s = 314, and s = 471, s = 314

as shown at right.                                         s = 471

Example 6.1 What length of arc is spanned by an angle of 120 on a circle of

radius 12 centimeters?

Solution. Because 120 = 1 , an angle of 120 is 1 of a complete revolution,
                    360 3                          3
as shown at right.

Using the formula above with r = 12, we find that                   s = 8 cm

1                         2
s = 3 (2 · 12) = 3 · 12 = 8 cm 120

or about 25.1 cm.                                          r = 12 cm

of radius 100 feet when you have turned through an angle of 150?
Answer. 261.8 ft

Measuring Angles in Radians

If you think about measuring arclength, you will see that the degree measure
of the spanning angle is not as important as the fraction of one revolution it
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                                       267

covers. This observation suggests a new unit of measurement for angles, one
that is better suited to calculations involving arclength. We'll make one change
in our formula for arclength, from

               Arclength = (fraction of one revolution) · (2r)

to
              Arclength = (fraction of one revolution × 2) · r

We'll call the quantity in parentheses, (fraction of one revolution ×2), the
radian measure of the angle that spans the arc.

                                             Radians.
         The radian measure of an angle is given by

                          (fraction of one revolution × 2)

For example, one complete revolution, or 360, is equal to 2 radians, and

one-quarter revolution, or 90, is equal to 1 (2) or  radians. The figure below
                                         4          2
shows the radian measure of the quadrantal angles.

          = 2             =               = 32

                                                        = 2

 = 2                      =                  = 32                  = 2

Example 6.3 What is the radian measure of an angle of 120?
Solution. An angle of 120 is 1 of a complete revolution, as we saw in the

                                           3
previous example. Thus, an angle of 120 has a radian measure of 1 (2), or

                                                                                          3

very familiar with both the exact values of these angles in radians and their

besides calculating arclengths, so we need to start thinking in radians. To help
that process, we'll first learn to convert between degrees and radians.

Converting Between Degrees and Radians

It is not difficult to convert the measure of an angle in degrees to its measure

in radians, or vice versa. One complete revolution is equal to 2 radians or to

360, so

                          360 = 2 radians

If we divide both sides of this equation by 360, we get a fraction that is equal

to 1:                          2 radians  radians
                          1 = 360 = 180

And of course it is also true that

                                   180
                          1=

                                radians

    Because multiplying by 1 does not change the value of a number, we can
use these fractions to convert between degrees and radians.

       · To convert from degrees to radians we multiply the degree measure
                radians

          by 180 .

    b (3) × 180 
                         
                     =  0.05 radians.

Thus, the fraction  (or its reciprocal 180 ) gives us a conversion factor
between degrees and radians:

                     Unit Conversion for Angles.

                                 180
                                            =1

                               radians

Note 6.10 You can review the use of conversion factors in the Algebra Refresher
at the end of this Section.

From our conversion factor we also learn that

         1 radian = 180  57.3                        1 rad 57.3
                           

So while 1 is a relatively small angle, 1 radian is
much larger -- nearly 60, in fact.

    But this is reasonable, because there are only a little more than 6 radians
in an entire revolution. An angle of 1 radian is shown above.

    We'll soon see that, for many applications, it is easier to work entirely in
radians. For reference, the figure below shows a radian protractor.

Arclength Formula

Now let us return to our calculation of arclength, and we'll see the first instance
in which measuring angles in radians is useful: To calculate an arclength we
need only multiply the radius of the circle by the radian measure of the spanning
angle, . Look again at our formula for arclength:

              Arclength = (fraction of one revolution × 2) · r

    The quantity in parentheses, fraction of one revolution ×2, is just the
measure of the spanning angle in radians. Thus, if  is measured in radians, we
have the following simple formula for arclength, s.

                                    Arclength Formula.

         On a circle of radius r, the length s of an arc spanned by an angle
     in radians is

                                              s = r

                                                                         1 rad

Thus, there is a special relationship between                   s=2             s=4
arclength and radians. An angle of 1 radian                                       4
spans an arc on a circle equal to the radius              s=1
of the circle, as shown at right. And the
length of any arc is just the measure of its               12
spanning angle in radians times the radius
of the circle.

So for instance, we can use the formula to find                    s
the arclength spanned by an angle of 2.5 radians
on a circle of radius six inches:                         2.5 radians
                                                               r = 6 in
            s = r = 6(2.5) = 15 inches
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                                           271

                                                               s
    We can also use the formula in the form  = to find an angle that spans a

                                                               r
given arc. For example, an arclength equal to one radius determines a central
angle of one radian, or about 57.3. In the next example, we compute a change

in latitude on the Earth's surface.

Example 6.11 The radius of the Earth is about 3960 miles. If you travel 500
miles due north, how many degrees of latitude will you traverse? (Latitude is
measured in degrees north or south of the equator.)

Solution.

We think of the distance 500 miles as an                             500 mi
arclength on the surface of the Earth, as          3960 mi 
shown at right. Substituting s = 500 and
r = 3960 into the arclength formula gives

500 = 3960 

=          500   = 0.1263 radians

           3960

To convert the angle measure to degrees, we multiply by  180  to get

                                                         

                    0.1263 180 = 7.23
                                 

Your latitude has changed by about 7.23.

five feet. What is the radius of the clock?
Answer. 9.55 ft

Unit Circle

In the rest of this chapter we will see how to use the trigonometric functions
sine, cosine, and tangent when the input variable is measured in radians instead
of degrees, and why making that change greatly increases the utility of those
functions. In Section 4.1 we connected the sine and cosine to the coordinates of
points on a unit circle, a circle of radius 1. Here is an important observation
that will inform our study:

    On a unit circle, r = 1, so the arclength formula becomes s = . Thus, on a
unit circle, an arc of length 1 determines a central angle of 1 radian, or about
57.3. And the measure of a (positive) angle in radians is equal to the length
of the arc it spans. In other words, if we walk around the circle, each time we
travel over an arclength of one radius, we turn through an angle of one radian.

Example 6.13 You are walking on a trail around a circular pond of radius one
mile. You have have walked 4 miles from the trailhead. Sketch your location
now.

Solution.

The pond is a unit circle, so you have traversed   4 mi
an angle in radians equal to the arc length trav-            r = 1 mi
eled, 4 miles. An angle of 4 radians is in the
middle of the third quadrant relative to your
starting point, more than halfway but less than
three-quarters around the pond.

6.2 The Circular Functions

Trigonometric Functions of Angles in Radians

Measuring angles in radians has other applications besides calculating arclength,
and we will need to evaluate trigonometric functions of angles in radians. The
sine, cosine, or tangent of a particular angle is the same whether the angle is
measured in radians or in degrees.

    In Section 4.1 we saw that the sine and cosine are related to points on a
unit circle.

                                 Angles in a Unit Circle.

         Let P be a point on a unit circle determined by the terminal side of
    an angle  in standard position. Then the coordinates (x, y) of P are
    given by

                                x = cos(), y = sin()

    This fact follows easily from the definitions of sine and cosine, because on a
unit circle r = 1. In the next Activity we'll use this relationship to get a feel
for the trig values of angles in radians.

Activity 6.2 Trigonometry in Radians. Here is a unit circle with ar-
clengths labeled, measured counterclockwise from (1, 0). (Note that the distance
around the whole circle is 6.28 units!) In Section 6.1 we learned that on a unit
circle, the measure of a positive angle in radians is equal to the length of the
arc that it spans.

Using a Calculator

Your calculator can give you the trigonometric function values for angles
expressed in radians. For example,  radians is the same as 60, because
 180   3
·  = 60 , so
3                                 

                    sin  = sin(60) = 3
                          3       2

However, we don't have to convert radians to degrees in order to evaluate trig
ratios. First, change the calculator setting from Degree mode to Radian mode.
Then enter

                                            sin ( ÷ 3)

and the calculator will return 0.8660254038. You can check that this number is

    a With the calculator in radian mode, and rounding to four decimal places
       we find

                         cos(7/4) = 0.7071
                         sin(7/4) = -0.7071

If two angles are coterminal they have the same trig values, just as they do

when measured in degrees. So adding or subtracting a multiple of 2 to any

angle results in a new angle in the same standard position and with the same

trig values.

b Rounded to four places, your calculator will give you the values

                                      sin(-4) = 0.7568

   By adding 6.2832 (that's approximately 2) to -4 we see that -4 radians
   is coterminal with 2.2832 radians, a second-quadrant angle. You can
   check that 2.2832 radians has (approximately) the same trig values as -4
   radians.

    Recall the formula for arclength when the angle is measured in radians:
                                                     s

s = r. If we solve for , we see that  = , a ratio of two lengths. The units of
                                                     r

length cancel out, so that radian measure has no units; it is a "dimensionless"

quantity. In other words, a radian measure is just a real number.

We shall see that this property makes radians especially useful in applications.

From now on we shall omit the tag "radians," and you may assume that any

angle given without units is in radians.

Sine and Cosine of Real Numbers

We have observed that the measure of an angle in radians is just a real number.
This is an important observation, because it allows us to define the sine and
cosine as functions of real numbers, instead of as functions of angles.

                         Sine and Cosine of Real Numbers.
         We define the trigonometric functions of the real number t by

                       cos(t) = cos() and sin(t) = sin()

    where  = t is an angle measured in radians.

    We can think of the definition this way: to find the sine or cosine of a real
number t, we find the sine or cosine of the angle  = t in radians.

Note 6.19 To understand the connection between real numbers and radians,
you may find it helpful to remember that the measure of a positive angle in
radians is equal to the length of the arc it spans on a unit circle.

                                                                   t=2

Consider the unit circle shown at right, and the     =2
angle  determined by the arc of length t. The
radian measure of  is the same as the length t of
the arc. (For example, in this figure  = t = 2.)
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                            283

    In practice, there is no difference between finding the sine or cosine of the
number 2 and the sine or cosine of an angle of 2 radians: in each case we set
the calculator in Radian mode and evaluate

                    cos (2) = -0.4161 and sin (2) = 0.9093

    So, in some sense then, a trig function of a radian is the same as a trig
function of a real number. This result is so important that it bears repeating:
to find the sine or cosine of a real number t, we find the sine or cosine of the
angle t radians. We can now use the trigonometric functions to model periodic
behavior as functions of time, or indeed, of any variable.

Example 6.20 The sunset time in Stockholm, Sweden, on the nth day of the
year can be modeled by

           T = 3.11 sin (0.017n - 1.38) + 6.03

where T is given in hours after noon. Find the sunset time on January 1 (day
n = 1) and on July 1 (day n = 182).

       50  100      150  200         250           300   350

Solution. Evaluate the function for n = 1 to find

           T = 3.11 sin (0.017(1) - 1.38) + 6.03 = 2.99

On January 1, sunset in Stockholm occurs about 2.99 hours after noon, or at
2:59 pm.

    Evaluate the function at n = 182 to find

       T = 3.11 sin (0.017(182) - 1.38) + 6.03 = 9.11

On July 1, sunset occurs about 9.11 hours after noon, or at 9:07 pm. (Actually,
10:07 pm, because of daylight savings time.)

Checkpoint 6.21 Variable stars are important in astronomy because they are

The Tangent Function

We can also define the tangent function for real numbers. Let P (x, y) be the
terminal point of an arc of length t in standard position on a unit circle. Then

                                                         y
                                           tan(t) =

                                                         x

Of course, this definition agrees with our earlier definition of the tangent
function for angles, because the point P lies on the terminal side of the angle
 = t radians.

For example, we saw earlier that, rounded to four

decimal places,                                        P (x, y)       t=2

     cos(2) = -0.4161 and sin(2) = 0.9093                        =2

so the coordinates of point P on the unit circle in
the figure at right are (-0.4161, 0.9093). Therefore,

         tan(2) =  0.9093   = -2.1853

                   -0.4161

You can set your calculator in radian mode to verify that, to three decimal

places,

                            tan(2) = -2.185

    Because the trig values can be found as coordinates on a unit circle, our
three trig functions are often called the circular functions. We now have the
following definitions for the circular functions of real numbers.

                            The Circular Functions.

    Let P be the terminal point of an arc of length t in standard position
on a unit circle. The circular functions of t are defined by
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                                       285

Solution. The circle is scaled in units of 0.1 radians, and an arc of 2.5 radians
in standard position has its terminal point, P , in the second quadrant. The
coordinates of P are approximately (-0.8, 0.6), so we have

   cos(2.5) = -0.8 and sin(2.5) = 0.6

and 60. Recall that the trig values for these angles can be used as benchmarks
for estimating and mental calculation. Now we review those values when the
angles are measured in radians.

    The easiest way to remember the special values is to refer to the sides of
the two special triangles:

We can graph the circular functions y = sin(t), y = cos(t), and y = tan(t) just
as we graphed trigonometric functions of angles in degrees. The only difference
is that we scale the horizontal axis in radians.

                    1

                                                                                 t
                             12345678
                  -1

    You can probably recognize this graph as one cycle of y = sin(t). For
example, you can see that the graph completes one cycle at t = 2 radians,

                                                                                                
or approximately 6.28. It reaches its maximum value, y = 1, at t = , or

                                                                                                2
approximately 1.57. You should also notice that y = 0 at t = , approximately
3.14.

    Instead of scaling the horizontal axis with integers, we often use multiples
of . Using such a scale, we can show the exact location of the intercepts of
the graph, and of its high and low points.

Example 6.29 Graph one cycle of y = sin(t), and scale the horizontal axis in
multiples of .

Solution. We start by making a table of values for sin(t), where t is in radians.
We'll use the special values of t, because we know the sines of those values.

       t0                                     2 3 5

   sin(t) 0 0.500 0.707 0.866 1.000 0.866 0.707 0.500 0

   In order to plot the points in the table, we scale the horizontal axis in
                                                                                          
multiples of . (Note that the special values are all multiples of . Thus,
              12                                                                          12
                        
   =2         , =3             , and so on.) The table lists values of sin(t) in the

   sin(t) 0 -0.500 -0.707 -0.866 -1.000 -0.866 -0.707 -0.500 0

   The completed graph is shown below.

    If we continued to plot points for values of t greater than 2 or less than 0,

we would see the periodic behavior of the graph, as it repeats the same shape
over each interval of length 2, just as it does for periods of 360 when the

Note 6.31 Because we know the basic shapes of the sine and cosine graphs, to

quadrantal angles, and then draw a smooth curve through the points. Try it
for yourself. Use the axes below.

Activity 6.5 Graphs of Sine and Cosine.
    We are going to graph f (t) = sin(t) and g(t) = cos(t) from their definitions.

The unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 at the left of each grid is marked off in radians.
(Each tick mark is 0.1 radian.) The horizontal t-axis of each grid is also marked
in radians.

1 Choose a value of t along the horizontal axis of the f (t) = sin(t) grid.
  This value of t represents an angle in radians.

2 Now look at the unit circle and find the point P designated by that same
   angle in radians.

3 Measure the vertical (signed) distance that gives the y-coordinate of point
   P.

4 At the value of t you chose in step 1, lightly draw a vertical line segment
   the same length as the y-coordinate of P . Put a dot at the top (or bottom)
   of the line segment.

The Tangent Function

Finally, we consider the graph of the tangent function. Once again, the only
difference between this new graph and our old version of the tangent graph in
degrees is that the horizontal axis is scaled in radians.

Example 6.32 Graph the tangent function, y = tan(t), where t is measured
in radians.

Solution. We begin by making a table of values for the tangent function. We
choose the special values for t between 0 and .

Plot the points and connect them

with smooth curves, remembering that
      

tan( 2 ) is undefined. The graph repeats 2
for values of t between  and 2. So,

while the graph in degrees had vertical

asymptotes at  = 90 and  = 270,                                                       t

Solving Equations

We can use the graphs of the circular functions find solutions to trigonometric
equations.

Example 6.34 Use a graph to find all solutions of cos(t) = -0.62 between 0
and 2.
Solution. The figure shows a graph of y = cos(t), with t in radians, and the
horizontal line y = -0.62. The solutions of the equation are the t-coordinates
of the intersection points, and these appear to be about t = 2.25 and slightly
over 4.0, perhaps 4.05. You can check that these values roughly satisfy the
equation; it is difficult to read the graph with any greater accuracy.

    b Find all solutions of the equation.

Solution.

    a The cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants, so we expect to
       find our answers between t = 1.57 and t = 4.71. We use a calculator to
       find one of the angles:
                                    cos-1 (-0.62) = 2.23953903

Rounded to hundredths, the second quadrant angle is t1 = 2.24 radans.
To find the other angle, we first find the reference angle for t1:

                                                              = 0.90
The third quadrant angle with the same ref-
erence angle is

            t2 =  + 0.90 = 4.04                 t2 = 4.04

Thus, the two solutions are t1 = 2.24 and t2 = 4.04 radians, as shown in
the figure.

b All angles coterminal with t1 and t2 are also solutions of the equation
    cos t = -0.62 . So adding or subtracting multiples of 2 to t1 and t2

   produces all the solutions. For example, 2.24 + 2 = 8.52 and 4.04 - 2 =
   -2.24 are solutions. We write the solutions as t = 2.24 ± 2k and
   t = 4.04 ± 2k, where k is an integer.

Solution. Because tan 4 = 1, one of the solutions is t1 = 4 . Remember

that there are two solutions between 0 and 2; and the tangent function is

positive in the third quadrant.

                                                             5

Modeling with Circular Functions

Now that we have defined trigonometric functions of real numbers, we can
describe periodic phenomena as functions of time (or other variables besides
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                                304

angles).
    For example, we began this chapter with a Ferris wheel of radius 100 feet

that rotates once every 8 minutes. If you board the Ferris wheel at the bottom,
your height is given as a function of time by

                                   
h = f (t) = 100 - 100 cos t

                                   4

where t is measured in minutes after boarding.

Thus, after 2 minutes your height is h

                                                             200

                                    
     f (2) = 100 - 100 cos 2 150

= 100 - 100(0) = 100      100

and after 4 minutes your height is 50

f (4) = 100 - 100 cos()                                                                                              t
                                                                  2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16

    The graph of h = f (t) is shown above. From the graph, we see that the
midline of the function is h = 100, its amplitude is 100, and its period is 8
(which is reasonable because the Ferris wheel rotates every 8 minutes). You
can review period, midline, and amplitude of periodic functions in Section 4.3.

Example 6.40 The formula

                                 
D(t) = 12.25 - 5.25 cos t

c On the longest day of the year, there are 12.25 + 5.25 = 17.5 hours of
   daylight in Glasgow.

d From the graph, we see that D(t) < 8 for t between 0 and 2, or in January

Domain and Range

The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values. For many
familiar functions, the domain is the set of all real numbers. In particular, the
domain of any linear or quadratic function is the set of all real numbers.

    Consider the functions f (x) = 2x + 5 and g(x) = x2 - 4 shown below. We
can use any real number as an input for either of these functions, and their
graphs extend across the entire x-axis.
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                                                  306

            -4                             -4                             -4

            -8                           -8                   -8
                                                                  
       f (x) = 2x + 5               g(x) = x2 - 4
Domain: all real numbers     Domain: all real numbers   h(x) = x + 3
Range: all real numbers      Range: y  -4              Domain: x  -3
                                                       Range: y  0

    However, for other types of functions we must sometimes exclude certain
values from the domain. For example, the domain of the function h(x) = x + 3
is restricted because we cannot take the square root of a negative number. We
must have x + 3  0, so the domain of the function consists of all x  -3.

    You can see the domain of afunction in its graph; notice that there are no
points on the graph of h(x) = x + 3 with x-coordinates less than -3.

    The range of a function is the set of all output values for the function. We
can also see the range of a function in its graph; it is the set of all y-values for
points on the graph.

· Because the graph of f (x) = 2x + 5 extends infinitely in both directions,
   its range consists of all real numbers. There is an input value that will
   produce any output we want.

· However, the range of g(x) = x2 - 4 consists of all y  -4, because there
   are no points on the graph with y-coordinate less than -4.
                               

· The range of h(x) = x + 3 consists of all y  0.

                               Domain and Range.

    The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values.
    The range of a function is the set of all output values for the
function.

Example 6.42 Find the domain and range of each function.

a f (x) = 1 - x2                                              1

Solution.

a There are no restrictions on the input values for this function, so its
   domain is all real numbers. The graph is a parabola with high point at
  (0, 1), so the range of the function is all y  1. See the figure below left.

                                                                 x-3
CHAPTER 6. RADIANS                                                      307

b Because we cannot divide by zero, we cannot allow x = 3 for this function.
   Thus, the domain of g is all real numbers except 3. The graph has a
   horizontal asymptote at y = 0, and you can see that there is no input
   that will produce an output of zero. So the range of g is all real numbers
   except 0.

Checkpoint 6.43 Use the formula and a graph to find the domain and range.

Answer.

a Dom (f ): all real numbers except -4, Rge (f ): all real numbers except 2

b Dom (8): (-, 5], Rge (g): [1, )

What about the domain and range of the trigonometric functions? The sine

and cosine both include all real numbers in their domains; we can find the sine

or cosine of any number. Because the output values of the sine and cosine are

both defined by the coordinates of points on a unit circle, their values cannot

be greater than 1 or less than -1. The range of both sine and cosine is the

interval [-1, 1].                                            

The tangent function is undefined at odd multiples of (that is, at
                                                             2
       -3 -  3
··· ,    , , , , · · ·), so those values must be excluded from its
       2 2 22
domain. However, the output values of the tangent function increase without
                           
bound as the input approaches from the left, and decrease from the right.
                           2
The range of the tangent is all real numbers.

6.4 Chapter 6 Summary and Review

Key Concepts

    1 The distance we travel around a circle of radius is proportional to the
       angle of displacement.
                   Arclength = (fraction of one revolution) · (2r)

    2 We measure angles in radians when we work with arclength.

                                                 Radians.
                The radian measure of an angle is given by

                               (fraction of one revolution × 2)

     3 An arclength equal to one radius determines a central angle of one radian.

     4 Radian measure can be expressed as multiples of  or as decimals.

                                    Arclength Formula.

            On a circle of radius r, the length s of an arc spanned by an
       angle  in radians is

                                              s = r

7 On a unit circle, the measure of a (positive) angle in radians is equal to
   the length of the arc it spans.

8 The sine, cosine, or tangent of a particular angle is the same whether the
   angle is measured in radians or in degrees.

9 You should be familiar with the trig values of the special angles in radians.

Circular Functions

   · Transformations of Graphs
   · The General Sinusoidal Function
   · Solving Equations

    Musical instruments produce sound by the vibration of a string on a violin,
guitar, or piano, or a column of air in a brass or woodwind instrument. The
vibration causes a periodic variation in air pressure that is heard as sound.
Periodic vibrations create a pleasing, musical sound, while random vibrations
sound like noise.

    There are three distinguishing characteristics of musical notes: loudness,
pitch, and timbre.

   · The loudness of a note is measured by the magnitude, or amplitude, of
       the changes in air pressure.

   · The pitch of the note is determined by its frequency, the number of times
       its basic pattern is repeated each second. For example, a note with pitch
       440 hertz repeats its pattern 440 times per second. Humans can hear
       frequencies that range roughly from 20 to 18,000 hertz.

   · The timbre of the note allows us to tell a piano note from a guitar note
       with the same loudness and pitch.

    The simplest pressure vibration is produced by a tuning fork. The graph
of its pressure function resembles a sine curve, and the corresponding sound
is called a pure tone. When a musical instrument produces a pure tone,
not only is its frequency produced, but integer multiples of the fundamental
frequency, called harmonics, are produced as well. Sine curves of different
frequencies combine to create the timbre of the note.

                                                 326
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS  327

    If two musical instruments play the same note, the notes have the same
pitch, but they sound different beause the amplitudes of each of the harmonics
is different for the two instruments.

    The French mathematician Joseph Fourier, who lived from 1768 to 1830,
discovered that any periodic wave can be written as the sum of a number of
sines and cosines with differing amplitudes.

    Fourier created a method for determining the frequencies and amplitudes of
the simpler waves that make up a more complicated periodic function. Applying
the Fourier transform to a sampled musical note reveals which component
frequencies are present in the note. The same sound can then be re-synthesized
by including those frequency components.
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS                                          328

    Today, Fourier analysis is the foundation of signal processing, not only for
audio waves, but for radio waves, light waves, seismic waves, and even images.
By analyzing a compound waveform, the "noise" components can be isolated
and removed in order to smooth out the signal.

    Fourier analysis is also used in X-ray crystallography to reconstruct a
crystal structure from its diffraction pattern, and in nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy to determine the mass of ions from the frequency of their motion
in a magnetic field.

7.1 Transformations of Graphs

In Chapter 4 we saw that the amplitude, period, and midline of a sinusoidal
graph are determined by the coefficients in its formula. The circular functions
(sine and cosine of real numbers) behave the same way.

Period, Midline, and Amplitude

Changes to the amplitude, period, and midline are called transformations of
the basic sine and cosine graphs.

· Changing the midline shifts the graph vertically.

· Changing the amplitude stretches or compresses the graph vertically.

· Changing the period stretches or compresses the graph horizontally.

First, we'll consider changes in amplitude.

Example 7.1 Compare the graphs of f (x) = 2 sin(x) and g(x) = 0.5 sin(x)
with the graph of y = sin(x).

Solution. Use technology to graph the three functions for -2  x  2.
The graphs are shown below.

                             y

             3                                 y = sin(x)

-2
   y = 0.5 sin(x)

-3

    All three graphs have the same period (2) and midline (y = 0), but the
graph of f has amplitude 2, and the graph of g has amplitude 0.5.

    The amplitude of y = A sin(t) is given by |A|, and the same is true of
y = A cos(t). In the next exercise, remember that the amplitude is always a
nonnegative number.

Checkpoint 7.2 Compare the graphs of f (x) = 3 cos(x) and g(x) = -3 cos(x)
with the graph of y = cos(x).

Answer. Both graphs have amplitude 3. The graph of g(x) = -3 cos(x) is
reflected about the x-axis.

                                             y = 3 cos(x)

Next, we'll consider changes in the period of the graph.

                                                                                                 1

                                                                                                 3
with the graph of y = cos(x).

Solution. Use technology to graph f (x) = cos(2x) and y = cos(x) for -2 
x  2, as shown below.

                             y                          y = cos(2x)
       y = cos(x) 2

Answer.
                                                                                          2

    a The graph of f completes 3 cycles from 0 to 2. Its period is .
                                                                                           3

    b The graph of g completes one cycle from 0 to 8. Its period is 8.
    Next we'll consider changes in midline.

Example 7.5 Compare the graph of f (x) = 2 + sin(x) with the graph of
y = sin(x).

Solution. Graph both functions -2  x  2. The graphs are shown below.

         y

3 y = 2 + sin(x)

-2 - -1                             x

                                 2

-2 y = sin(x)

-3

    Each point on the graph of f (x) = 2 + sin(x) has y-coordinate 2 units higher
than the corresponding point on the graph of y = sin(x). Thus, the graph
of f (x) = 2 + sin(x) is shifted vertically by 2 units relative to the graph of
y = sin(x). In particular, the midline of f (x) = 2 + sin(x) is the line y = 2.

Checkpoint 7.6 Compare the graph of g(x) = -3 + cos(x) with the graph of
y = cos(x).

Answer. The graph of g is shifted down 3 units. Its midline is y = -3.
    Here is a summary of our findings.

                        y = A cos(x) or y = A sin(x)

2 The graph of

                        y = cos(Bx) or y = sin(Bx)

   has midline y = k.

                      y = k + A sin(Bx) or y = k + A cos(Bx)
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS                             331

By adjusting the amplitude, period, and midline of the sine or cosine graph, we
can sketch these sinusoidal functions.
Example 7.7

    a State the amplitude, period, and midline of y = 2 + 3 cos(4t).

    b Sketch by hand a graph of y = 2 + 3 cos(4t).

Solution.

a The amplitude of the graph is 3, its midline is y = 2, and its period is
   2 
        =.
    42

b One way to make a quick sketch of a sinusoidal graph is to use a table of
   values. The trick is to choose convenient values for the input variable. In
   the table below, notice that we choose the quadrantal angles as the input
   values for the trigonometric function.

Modeling with Sinusoidal Functions

Sinusoidal functions are used to model a great variety of physical phenomena,
including sound and light waves, tides and planetary orbits, and the life cycles of
plants and animals. They are also often used to approximate periodic functions
that are not exactly sinusoidal, such as blood pressure.
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS                                                  333

Example 7.9 A typical blood pressure for a healthy adult, measured in
millimeters of mercury, varies between 70 and 110, and a typical heart rate
is 60 beats per minute. Write a sinusoidal function that approximates blood
pressure, and sketch its graph.

Solution. We would like a function of the form y = k + a sin(Bt), so we must
find the values of the parameters A, B and k.

· The midline of the graph is y =  70 + 110        = 90, and the amplitude is

       110 - 90 = 20, so A = 20 and k = 90.  2

                                                                                1
· The graph repeats 60 times per minute, so the period is minute, and

                                                                               60
          2
   B = 1 = 120.

               60

Thus,

                            y = 90 + 20 sin(120t)

The graph of the function is shown below.

               y

                            1/60             1/30  1/20

Note 7.10 In the preceding Example, we could have chosen either a sine or a
cosine function to model blood pressure; both describe the periodic behavior
described. However, if we are given, or would like to specify, the starting
point for a sinusoidal function, one choice can be more suitable than the other.
Consider the functions graphed below.

                            2                                            2

          c. y = 3 cos(2x)                            d. y = -3 cos(2x)

    All four functions have the same amplitude and period, but they start at
different points on the cycle.
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS                                 334

· The graphs in (a) and (b) start on the midline, so they are best modeled
   by sine functions.

· The graph in (b) starts out decreasing instead of increasing, so the
   coefficient A is negative.

   · The graph in (c) is modeled by a cosine, because it starts at the maximum
       point, and the graph in (d) starts at the minimum point, so we choose a
       negative cosine to model it.

    (In Section 7.2, we'll consider sinusoidal functions that start at other posi-
tions on the cycle.)

    In the next Checkpoint, note the starting point of the graph, and choose
the most appropriate sinusoidal function to model the function.

The Tangent Function

The transformations of shifting and stretching can be applied to the tangent
function as well. The graph of y = tan x does not have an amplitude, but we
can see any vertical stretch by comparing the function values at the guidepoints.
Example 7.12

    a Graph y = 1 + 3 tan(2x).

    b Describe the transformations of the graph, compared to y = tan(x).

Solution.

    a Recall that the period of the tangent function is . We make a table of
                                                                                   

       values for one cycle of the function, choosing multiples of as the inputs
                                                                                   4

       for the tangent function. Then we plot the guidepoints, and sketch a
       tangent function through them. The graph is shown below.

b Writing the formula as

                     y = A tan(Bx) + k = 3 tan(2x) + 1

we see that the graph is stretched vertically by a factor of A = 3. The
midline is y = 1, so the graph is shifted up by 1 unit. Finally, the
coefficient B = 2 compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 2, so

                                   
the period of the graph is , and there are four cycles between 0 and 2

Concepts

    1 Changes to the amplitude, period, and midline of the basic sine and
       cosine graphs are called transformations. Changing the midline shifts
       the graph vertically, changing the amplitude stretches or compresses the
       graph vertically, and changing the period stretches or compresses the
       graph horizontally.

3 The graph of
                 y = k + cos(x) or y = k + sin(x)

   has midline y = k.

3 One way to make a quick sketch of a sinusoidal graph is to use a table of
  values. The trick is to choose convenient values for the input variable.

4 The transformations of shifting and stretching can be applied to the
   tangent function as well.

7.2 The General Sinusoidal Function

Horizontal Shifts

In the previous section we considered transformations of sinusoidal graphs,
including vertical shifts, which change the midline of the graph, vertical stretches
and compressions, which change its amplitude, and horizontal stretches and
compressions, which occur when we change the period of the graph.

    In this section we consider one more transformation, shifting the graph
horizontally. The figure below shows four different transformations of the graph
of y = sin(x).

                        -3

    We can see why this shift occurs by studying a table of values for the two
functions.

    Notice that in the table, g has the same function values as f , but each one
             

is shifted units to the right. The same thing happens in the graph: each
             4

y-value appears units farther to the right on g than it does on f .

Answer. The graph of g is shifted units to the left of f .

                                                 4

    The examples above illustrate the following principle.

                     Horizontal Shifts.

The graphs of

          y = sin(x - h) and t = cos(x - h)

are shifted horizontally compared to the graphs of y = sin(x) and
y = cos(x).

· If h > 0, the graph is shifted to the right.
· If h < 0, the graph is shifted to the left.

    We can use a table of values to sketch graphs that involve horizontal shifts.

Example 7.16 Make a table of values and sketch a graph of y =
                

-2 cos x + .
                 3

Solution. First notice that we can write the equation as

                                          -
                  y = -2 cos x -

                                           3

                                                    
so that h = - , and we expect the graph to be shifted units to the left

compared to the graph of y = cos(x).
    We choose convenient values for the inputs of the cosine function, namely
     

x+ .

From those values, we work backwards to x and forwards to y. (To obtain
                                    
the values of x, we subtract from the values of x + .)

Combining Transformations

The order in which we apply transformations to a function makes a difference
in the graph. We'll compare the graphs of the two functions

                                                                                   
         f (x) = sin 2 x -                         and g(x) = sin 2x -

                                   3                                               3

Graph the two functions for 0  x  2, along with y = sin(2x), as shown
below. Each graph involves a horizontal shift relative to y = sin(2x), but

                                  
the graph of f is shifted units to the right, while the graph of g is shifted

       3
only units to the right. This difference occurs because of the order of the

       6
transformations.

       f (x) = sin 2 x -                                  g(x) = sin 2x -

                                 3                                               3

We transform the graph of y = sin(x) into the graph of f in two steps:
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS                                                                         349

    Step 1: First we replace x by 2x to get y = sin(2x), which compresses the
graph horizontally by a factor of 2. (See figure (a) below.)

                                                                                           , which
    Step 2: Then we replace x by x - to get f (x) = sin 2 x -

shifts the graph units to the right. (See figure (b).)

    To transform the graph of y = sin(x) into the graph of g, we perform the

two steps in the opposite order:                                             

    Step 1: We replace x by x - which shifts the graph units to the right.

    Step 2: Then we replace x by 2x to get g(x) = sin 2x -

                                                                                        3

compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 2, including the horizontal
                                                           

shift. This reduces the horizontal shift from to . (See figure (b.)

    It is easier to analyze the transformations in the function f , because we can
read the horizontal shift from the formula.

                                                             
                                   f (x) = sin 2 x -

where 2 is the compression factor and is the horizontal shift.

                                                   3
    We can write the formula for g(x) in the same easy-to-analyze form by
factoring the input for the sine function:

                                                                   
                   g(x) = sin 2x - = sin 2 x -
                                             3                     6

    In general, if we write the formula for a sinusoidal function in standard
form, we can read all the transformations from the constants in the formula.

                Standard Form for Sinusoidal Functions.
    The graphs of the functions

   y = A sin(B(x - h)) + k and y = A cos(B(x - h)) + k

are transformations of the sine and cosine graphs.

    1 The amplitude is |A|.
    2 The midline is y = k.

                           2
    3 The period is , B = 0.

                          |B|
    4 The horizontal shift is h units to the right if h is positive, and h

       units to the left if h is negative.

Example 7.18
    a State the midline, amplitude, period, and horizontal shift for the function
                                       f (x) = 4 cos(3x + ) - 2

    b Sketch a graph of the function for -  x  .
Solution.

    a First, we write the input for the cosine function in factored form:

                    f (x) = 4 cos 3 x +     -2

                                         3

Comparing the formula for f with the standard form, we see that A = 4,

           -
B = 3, h = , and k = 2. Thus, the midline is y = -2, the amplitude
           3
                2                           
is 4, the period is , and the horizontal shift is units to the left.

b Use a table of values to locate the guidepoints for the graph. Begin by
   choosing convenient values for the input, 3x + . Then work backwards
   to find values for x and forwards to find values for f (x).

Modeling with Sinusoidal Functions

In Section 7.1 we found formulas for sinusoidal functions that start on the
midline, or at their maximum or minimum value. We use horizontal trans-
formations to write formulas for functions that start at other points on the
cycle.

Example 7.20 Find a formula for the sinusoidal function whose graph is shown
below.
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS                                            352

                             y

                          4                                     x

                        -4

Solution. The midline of the graph is y = 0, and its amplitude is 4. It has
                                                                                  

the shape of a cosine, but its maximum value occurs at x = instead of at
                                        6

x = 0; so the graph is shifted units to the right, compared to the graph of
                                        6

y = cos(x).

                                                                   13
The graph completes one cycle between x = and x = , so its
                                                             6     6
period is 2. Thus, we use the standard form y = A cos B(x - h) + k with
                 
A = 4, B = 1, h = , and k = 0, giving us
                 6

                                                 6

as our formula for the function.

Note 7.21 In Example 4, our solution is not the only sinusoidal function that

fits the given graph. For example, if we regard the graph as a sine function

                                                                      
shifted units to the left, we would use the formula y = 4 sin x + . You

can check that the two functions have identical graphs. Usually it is a good

idea to choose a formula with a small horizontal shift.

    Many natural phenomena can be modeled with sinusoidal functions.

Example 7.23 Sunspots are dark regions on the Sun first observed by Galileo
in 1610. The number of sunspots is not constant, but varies with a period of
approximately 11 years, called the solar cycle. Solar activity is directly related
to this cycle, and can cause disturbances in the earth's upper atmosphere.
Planning for satellite orbits and space missions requires knowledge of solar
activity levels years in advance.

    The figure below shows sunspot data for the last solar cycle, from July, 1985
through June, 1996, and a sinusoidal function that models the data.
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS                                   353

a The period of the solar cycle shown is actually 10.8 years. Use this
   information and the graph to write a formula for the model.

b Improve the fit of the model by adjusting its horizontal shift.

Solution.

a The graph has the shape of y = - cos x. It appears to have midline y = 75
   and amplitude 75, so k = 75 and A = -75 To find B, we compute

           B=  2  =            2  = 0.58

               period 10.8

Thus, a formula for the model is y = 75 - 75 cos[0.58(x - h)].

b Fitting a curve by eye is a subjective process, but it looks like we can get
   a better fit by shifting the curve slightly to the left. By trying several
   values for h in
                                y = 75 - 75 cos[0.58(x - h)],

   we might settle on h = 0.3, which results in the curve shown below.

Checkpoint 7.24 The figure below shows the sunspot data for the solar cycle
that began in July 1996, and a curve of best fit calculated by NASA. This curve
is not sinusoidal, but has a similar shape.

   are shifted horizontally compared to the graphs of y = sin(x) and
   y = cos(x).
1 · If h > 0, the graph is shifted to the right.

      · If h < 0, the graph is shifted to the left.

7.3 Solving Equations

Introduction

We have seen that an equation of the form sin() = k (for -1 < k < 1) always

has two solutions between 0 and 2. For example, the figure below illustrates

              5
that x = and x = are solutions of the equation sin(x) = 0.5. These two
6             6
solutions correspond to the two points on the unit circle where y = 0.5.

                      y = sin(x)                    The unit circle

    The calculator gives us only one of these solutions, but we can use reference

angles to find the other solution. In fact, if we use a calculator to find one
solution as 1 = sin-1(k), then the other solution is 2 =  - 1. You can see
this by considering the symmetry of the sine graph, or of the unit circle, as

shown below.

k                                       - 1                  1 y = k

                               Solutions of sin() = k, k > 0

    This relationship between the two solutions still holds if k is negative,
because the calculator returns a negative angle for 1 = sin-1(k). See the figure
below.

Note 7.25 Why is  -  greater than  in the figure above? Think about

negative numbers: if  is a negative number, then  -  is greater than . For

Example 7.26 Solve sin() = -0.58 for 0   < 2.
Solution. The calculator gives us the solution

                      sin-1(-0.58) = -0.6187

However, because this solution is not between 0 and 2, we find a coterminal

angle,

                1 = sin-1(-0.58) + 2 = -0.6187 + 2 = 5.6645

for the solution in the fourth quadrant. The second quadrant solution is

                2 =  - sin-1(-0.58) =  + 0.6187 = 3.7603

To four decimal places, the desired solutions are 3.7603 and 5.6645.

    A similar method applies to equations of the form cos() = k. The two
solutions between 0 and 2 are 1 = cos-1(k) and 2 = 2 - cos-1(k). Once
again, you can see this by considering the symmetry of the cosine graph, or of

    The relationship between the two solutions still holds if k is negative. See
the figure below.

Answer. 1.9391, 4.3441
    Equations of the form tan() = k are generally easier to solve, because there

is only one solution in each cycle of the graph. Each solution differs from the
previous one by , as shown below.

k                                                                    slope = k

                         + 1

                        Solutions of tan() = k,

For example, to solve the equation tan() = -2.4 for 0   < 2, we first

calculate

                        tan-1(-2.4) = -1.1760

Because this angle is not between 0 and 2, we add  to find the next two
solutions:

                        1 = -1.1760 +  = 1.9656
                        2 = 1.9656 +  = 5.1072

    We summarize these observations for the three trigonometric functions as
follows.

Example 7.28 Find all solutions of sin(2x) = 0.5 between 0 and 2.

Solution. We begin as usual, by taking the inverse sine of each side of the

equation, to get

                                 2x = sin-1(0.5)

There are two values of 2x between 0 and 2 with sin(2x) = 0.5 namely 2x =  

               5                                                           6

and 2x =  - = . Solving these equations for x yields x = and x = .
              66                                             12           12
But these are only two of the four solutions! The graph of y = sin(2x)

completes two cycles between 0 and 2, each of length . We must add  to

each of the first two solutions to find the solutions in the second cycle. These

two solutions are

be included in the set of all solutions between 0 and 2. The four solutions are

    As we observed earlier, equations involving the tangent function are easier
to solve, because there is only one solution in each cycle of the graph. Once we
have found one solution, we can find all the others by adding multiples of the
period.

The larger the value of n, the more cycles the graph completes between 0

and 2, and the more solutions we find. Thus, for -1 < k < 1, there are six

solutions of sin(3x) = k between 0 and 2, eight solutions of sin(4x) = k, and

so on. (See the figure below.)

                                2                                          2

       y = sin(3x)                                          y = sin(4x)

Using a Calculator for Multiple Solutions

Of course, if k is not one of the special values, we'll need a calculator to help
us solve the equation.

Example 7.32 Solve 1 + 4 cos(2x) = 2 for 0  x  2.
Solution. We first solve for the trig ratio, cos(2x)

       1 + 4 cos(2x) = 2              Subtract 1 from both sides.
            4 cos(2x) = 1             Divide both sides by 4.
              cos(2x) = 0.25

Next, we use a calculator to find two solutions of cos(2x) = 0.25. The solutions
of this equation, rounded to three decimal places, are

       2x = 1.318                  and                      2x = 4.965

x1 = 0.659                                x2 = 2.483

Finally, because the period of the function f (x) = cos(2x) is , we can find the
other two solutions by adding  to the first two solutions, to get

                   x3 = 0.659 +  = 3.801
                   x4 = 2.483 +  = 5.624

To two decimal places, the four solutions are 0.66, 2.48, 3.80, and 5.62

Answer. 0.24, 1.86, 2.33, 2,95, 4.43, 6.06

Using a Substitution

For more complicated equations, it can be helpful to use a substitution, in order
to reduce the equation to the form sin() = k or cos() = k or tan() = k.
We want our substitution to replace the input of the sine function by a single
variable. For example, in the next example, we substitute  for the angle
2x + 1.5, so that the equation sin(2x + 1.5) = -0.3 becomes sin() = -0.3.

Example 7.34 Use a substitution to solve sin(2x + 1.5) = -0.3 for
0  x  2.
Solution. We expect to find four solutions. Let  = 2x + 1.5, and use a
calculator to find two solutions of sin() = -0.3. The solutions, rounded to
three decimal places, are

        1 = sin-1(-0.3) = -0.3047 and 2 =  - sin-1(-0.3) = 3.4463

Because  is not between 0 and 2, we find a coterminal angle,
                              1 = sin-1(-0.3) + 2 = 5.9785

Next we replace  by 2x+1.5 to find two of the solutions of the original equation:

2x + 1.5 = 3.4463  and                    2x + 1.5 = 5.9785

x1 = 0.9731                               x2 = 2.2392

Finally, because the period of the function f (x) = sin(2x + 1.5) is , we find
the other two solutions by adding  to the first two solutions, to get

            x3 = 0.9731 +  = 4.1147
            x4 = 2.2392 +  = 5.3808

Rounded to hundredths, the four solutions are 0.97, 2.24, 4.11, and 5.38.

   solution.

Example 7.36 Find all solutions between 0 and 2 to 5 + 0.4 tan(3x - 0.5) =
4.5.

Solution. The graph of f (x) = 5 + 0.4 tan(3x - 0.5) completes six cycles
between 0 and 2, so we expect to find six solutions, as illustrated below. We'll
use the substitution  = 3x - 0.5 to reduce the equation to 5 + 0.4 tan() = 4.5.
Next, we isolate the trig ratio.

                                       y

Subtract 5 from both sides of the

equation, then divide by 0.4.      6

         0.4 tan  = -0.5           4
             tan  = -1.25
                                   2
Now we can solve for .
  = tan-1(-1.25) = -0.8960                                                  x

                                   -1                                    2

                                          f (x) = 5 + 0.4 tan(3x - 0.5)

Replacing  by 3x - 0.5, we find the first solution.

                                      3x - 0.5 = -0.8960
                                              3x = -0.3960
                                               x = -0.1320
                                                                                                    

This value of x is not between 0 and 2, but because the period of f (x) is ,
                3

we can add  1.0472 to any solution to find another solution.
                3

                              x1 = -0.1320 + 1.0472 = 0.9152
                              x2 = 0.9152 + 1.0472 = 1.9624
                              x3 = 1.9624 + 1.0472 = 3.0096
                              x4 = 3.0096 + 1.0472 = 4.0568

Applications

Trigonometric equations often arise in the study of periodic models.

Example 7.38 A piston is pumping vertically at a rate of 1000 cycles per
second. The distance between its lowest and highest position is 16 centimeters.

    a Suppose the piston is at its midline position at t = 0 and moving down-
       wards. Find a formula for the sinusoidal function h(t) that gives the
       piston's height.

    b Use the formula to find the first two times the piston is 14 centimeters
       above its lowest position.

Solution.

    a Because the piston starts at its midline and moves down, we will write
       h(t) as a sine function:

                            h(t) = -A sin(Bt) + k

                            16
The amplitude is A = = 8, and the midline is k = 8. The period is

b With h(t) = 14, we have

         -8 sin(2000t) + 8 = 14                 Subtract 8 from both sides.
              -8 sin(2000t) = 6                 Divide both sides by - 8.
                                      -3
                  sin(2000t) =
                                       4

We use the substitution  = 2000t and find two positive solutions of the

Replace  by 2000t, and solve each equation for t:

         2000t = 5.4351                    and  2000t = 3.9897

                     t = 0.000865                  t = 0.000635

Thus, the first two times the piston is at a height of 14 centimeters are
approximately t = 0.000865 and t = 0.000635 seconds.

7.4 Chapter 7 Summary and Review

Key Concepts

    1 Changes to the amplitude, period, and midline of the basic sine and
       cosine graphs are called transformations. Changing the midline shifts
       the graph vertically, changing the amplitude stretches or compresses the
       graph vertically, and changing the period stretches or compresses the
       graph horizontally.

    2 The order in which we apply transformations to a function makes a
       difference in the graph.

            Amplitude, Period, and Midline of Sinusoidal Functions.

         3 1 The graph of

                                     y = A cos(x) or y = A sin(x)

                   has amplitude |A|.
                2 The graph of

                                     y = cos(Bx) or y = sin(Bx)
                                    2
                   has period .
                                    B
                3 The graph of

                                  y = k + cos(x) or y = k + sin(x)

                   has midline y = k.

                             Horizontal Shifts.
    The graphs of

                 y = sin(x - h) and t = cos(x - h)
are shifted horizontally compared to the graphs of y = sin(x) and
CHAPTER 7. CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS                                     380

   y = cos(x).
4 · If h > 0, the graph is shifted to the right.

      · If h < 0, the graph is shifted to the left.

               Standard Form for Sinusoidal Functions.
       The graphs of the functions

         y = A sin B(x - h) + k and y = A cos B(x - h) + k

   are transformations of the sine and cosine graphs.
5 1 The amplitude is |A|.

       2 The midline is y = k.
                              2

       3 The period is , B = 0.
                             |B|

       4 The horizontal shift is h units to the right if h is positive,
          and h units to the left if h is negative.

                 Solutions of Trigonometric Equations.

6 1 The equation cos() = k, - 1 < k < 1, has two solutions
          between 0 and 2:

                           1 = cos-1(k) and 2 = 2 - 1

       2 The equation sin() = k, - 1 < k < 1, has two solutions
          between 0 and 2:

                     If k > 0 : 1 = sin-1(k) and 2 =  - 1
             If k < 0 : 1 = sin-1(k) + 2 and 2 =  - sin-1(k)

       3 The equation tan() = k, has two solutions between 0 and
          2:
                     If k > 0 : 1 = tan-1(k) and 2 =  + 1
                  If k < 0 : 1 = tan-1(k) +  and 2 =  + 1

7 If n is a positive integer, the equations sin(n) = k and cos(n) = k each
   have 2n solutions between 0 and 2, for -1 < k < 1.

8 The equation tan(n) = k has one solution in each cycle of the graph.

    Mapmakers have always faced an unavoidable challenge: It is impossible
to translate the surface of a sphere onto a flat map without some form of
distortion. Over the years, a variety of map projections have been developed to
suit different uses.

    The sixteenth century was an age of discovery, when explorers and merchants
began sailing to distant and previously unknown lands. But at that time there
was no reliable technology for navigation. Although more regions of the world
were being mapped more accurately, a flat map by itself was not enough to
help a sailor in the middle of the ocean.

                                                 386
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES  387

 In 1569, the Flemish cartographer
 Gerardus Mercator published a new
 map using what is known as a cylin-
 drical projection. To imagine how a
 Mercator projection works, picture
 shining a light through a glass globe
 onto a piece of paper rolled into a
 cylinder and wrapped around the
 globe. The cylinder is tangent to
 the globe at its equator.

    Notice how the latitude lines are farther apart the farther you get from the
Equator. This projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases,
so that Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they actually are.

    But the Mercator projection map is ideally suited for navigation, because
any straight line on the map is a line of constant true bearing. If a navigator
measures the bearing on the map from his location to his destination, he can
set his ship's compass for the same bearing and maintain that course.

    However, the Mercator projection does not preserve distances. On a globe,
circles of latitude (also known as parallels) get smaller as they move away from
the Equator towards the poles. Thus, in the Mercator projection, when a globe
is "unwrapped" on to a rectangular map, the parallels need to be stretched
to the length of the Equator. Mercator had to increase the scale of his map
gradually as it moved away from the equator, so that the latitude lines appear
equal in length to the equator.

    The horizontal scale factor at any latitude must be inversely proportional
to lengths on that latitude. Because the radius of the circle of latitude  is
R cos , the corresponding parallel on the map must be stretched by a factor of

  1
      . And because the secant is the reciprocal of the cosine, the scale factor is

cos 
proportional to the secant of the latitude.

    A variety of "equal area" projections have been developed in modern times,
but the Mercator projection is still widely used, in classrooms and atlases. For
many people, it represents our image of the world.

8.1 Sum and Difference Formulas

In Chapter 5 we studied identities that relate the three trigonometric functions
sine, cosine, and tangent.

                       Pythagorean and Tangent Identities.

Pythagorean identity     sin2() + cos2() = 1
Tangent identity                       sin()

                         tan() =
                                       cos()

    If we know one of the three trig values for an angle, we can find the other
two by using these identities. Identities are useful for changing from one form to
another when solving equations, and for finding exact values for trigonometric
functions.

    Are there identities relating the trig ratios of different angles?
    For example, if we know the sine of 27, can we find the sine of 2(27) = 54
without using a calculator? Or, if we know cos() and cos(), can we calculate
cos( + )?

The Sum of Angles Identities

All of the identities that relate the trig ratios of different angles are derived
from the sum and difference formulas. Let's see why we need these formulas.

    Is it true that

                           cos( + ) and cos() + cos()

are equal for any values of  and  ? We can test this hypothesis by evaluating
both expressions for some specific values of  and , say  = 45 and  = 30,
as shown below.

1                     1                  1

   75                    45                 30
        1                          1                 1

Is cos 75 =  cos 45                   +  cos 30         ?
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                              389

    From the figure, you should be able to see that cos(75) is in fact smaller
than either cos(45) or cos(30), so it cannot be true that cos(75) is equal to
cos(45) + cos 3(0).

Example 8.1 Verify that cos(45 + 30) is not equal to cos(45) + cos(30).
Solution. Use your calculator to evaluate each expression.

                               cos(45 + 30) = cos(75) = 0.2588
               but cos(45) + cos(30) = 0.7071 + 0.8660 = 1.5731

The two expressions are not equal.

Checkpoint 8.2 Show that sin(60 + 30) is not equal to sin(60) + sin(30).
                                                   
                                                     31
Answer. sin(60 + 30) = 1, but sin(60) + sin(30) =      +
                                                   22

Caution 8.3 Because the values of the expressions in the previous Example and
Exercise are different, it is not true that cos( + ) is equal to cos() + cos()
for all angles  and , or that sin( + ) is equal to sin() + sin().

    It turns out that there is a relationship between the trig ratios for  + 
and the trig ratios of  and , but it is a little more complicated.

                    Sum of Angles Identities.

cos( + ) = cos() cos() - sin() sin()
sin( + ) = sin() cos() + cos() sin()

    Notice that to find the sine or cosine of  +  we must know (or be able to
find) both trig ratios for both and  and .

    The sum and difference formulas can be used to find exact values for trig
ratios of various angles.

Example 8.4 Find an exact value for cos(105).
Solution. We can write 105 as the sum of two special angles: 105 = 60+45.
Now apply the sum of angles identity for cosine.

cos(60 + 45) = cos(60) cos(45) - sin(60) sin(45)

                           22 2 2              4


Thus, cos(105) = 2 - 6 . You can check that your calculator gives the same

The difference formulas for sine and cosine can be derived easily from the sum
formulas, using the identities for negative angles. Note that the difference
formulas are identical to the corresponding sum formulas, except for the signs.

Double Angle Identities

There are a number of other very useful identities that can be derived from
the sum and difference formulas. In particular, if we set  =  =  in the sum
of angles identities (also called addition formulas), we obtain the double
angle formulas. These identities are used frequently, so it is helpful to know
them well.

                                 Double Angle Identities.

                               cos(2) = cos2() - sin2()

                                 sin(2) = 2 sin() cos()
                                                     2 tan()

                                  tan(2) = 1 - tan2()

    You can also justify the identities to yourself by graphing both sides of the
formula to see that the graphs are identical.
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                                   393

Caution 8.12 The first thing we can learn from the double angle formulas is

that sin(2) is not equal to 2 sin()! You can check this very easily by choosing
a value for , say 45. Then

                      sin(2) = sin(90) = 1

                  but 2 sin() = 2 sin(45) = 2      2 
                                                            =2
                                                     2

     
and 2 = 1. Similarly, cos(2) = 2 cos() and tan(2) = 2 tan()

Example 8.13

Find sin(2) for the angle  shown. 2

                                                            
                                                                  3

Solution. We start by using the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse

of the triangle.

                                c2 = 22 + 32 = 13

                                   3                 2
so c = 13. Thus, cos() =  and sin() =  . Now we can use these
                                   13                13

values in the double angle identity to find sin(2).

                      sin(2) = 2 sin() cos()

Answer. cos(2) = , tan(2) =
                      13                  5

We will often work with algebraic expressions instead of numerical values

for the trig ratios.

Example 8.15

Use the figure to express cos(2) in                                  a
terms of a.                                                              

                                                                      3

Solution. We use the Pythagorean Theorem to find an expression for the
third side of the triangle.

                  a2 + b2 = 32                     Solve for b.

                      b = 9 - a2

Now we can write expressions for the sine and cosine of .

                                a                       9 - a2

                      cos() = and sin() =

CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                                  394

Finally, we substitute these expressions into the double angle identity.

                  cos(2) = cos2() - sin2()

                                    a2              9 - a2    2

                             =         3      -     3

By using the Pythagorean identity, we can write the double angle formula

for cosine in two alternate forms.

                  cos(2) = cos2() - sin2()
                            = cos2() - (1 - cos2())
                            = 2 cos2() - 1

                              cos(2) = cos2() - sin2()
                                        = (1 - sin2()) - sin2()
                                        = 1 - 2 sin2()

    Thus, we have three forms for the double angle formula for cosine, and we
can use whichever form is most convenient for a particular problem.

                                          = 1 - 2 sin2()

                                                                                                  x

Solving Equations

If a trigonometric equation involves more than one angle, we use identities to
rewrite the equation in terms of a single angle.

Example 8.19 Solve sin(2x) - cos(x) for 0  x  2.
Solution. We first use the double angle formula to write sin(2x) in terms of
trig functions of x alone.

                                          sin(2x) - cos(x) = 0
                                 2 sin(x) cos(x) - cos(x) = 0

    Once we have all the trig functions in terms of a single angle, we try to
write the equation in terms of a single trig function. In this case, we can factor
the left side to separate the trig functions.

2 sin(x) cos(x) - cos(x) = 0

cos(x)(2 sin(x) - 1) = 0               Set each factor equal to zero.
                                       Solve each equation.

Activity 8.2 Identities. I Sum of Angles Identities

1 Is it true that cos( + ) = cos() + cos()? Try it for  = 60 and
    = 45.

2 a Recall the distributive law, a(b + c) = ab + ac, where the parentheses
         denote multiplication. Is the same law true when the parentheses
         denote a function? In other words, is it true that f (a + b) =
         f (a) + f (b)?

      b In the expression sin( + ), do the parentheses denote multiplication
         or the application of a function? Does the distributive law apply
         to sin( + )? Do you think that sin( + ) = sin() + sin() is an
         identity?

3 a Look at the Sum of Angles Identities in this section. Make some
         observations that will help you memorize these formulas.

      b Do you think you would have to memorize these formulas if the
         equation sin( + ) = sin() + sin() were an identity?

II Difference of Angles Identities, Tangent Identities
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                     396

1 a Yikes! More formulas. Compare the Difference of Angles Identities
         with the Sum of Angles Identities. If you have memorized the Sum
         formulas, how can you also memorize the Difference formulas?

      b Comment on the sign patterns in the Sum and Difference Identities
         for Tangent.

2 a Now let's use the formulas backwards: look at the expression below:

                                        tan(285) - tan(75)
                                       1 + tan(285) tan(75)

         Does it remind you of the left side of one of the six new identities?
         Use that identity to simplify the expression.
      b Do the same thing for this expression:

                                sin(4t) cos(0.7) - cos(4t) sin(0.7)

III Double Angle Identities

    1 a Is it true that sin(2) = 2 sin()? Choose a value for  and try it.
              Sketch  and 2 on a unit circle and show the sine of each.

           b Is it true that cos(2) = 2 cos()? Repeat part (a) for cosine.

    2 a Substitute  =  and  =  into the sum of angles formulas for sine,
              cosine, and tangent to derive the double angle formulas.

           b Choose one of the three forms of the Double Angle Identity for
              Cosine. Use the Pythagorean Identity to convert from that form to
              each of the other two forms.

             (b). Simplify the equation to obtain cos( - ) = cos() cos() +
              sin() sin().

8.2 Inverse Trigonometric Functions

We have been using the calculator keys sin-1, cos-1, and tan-1 to find approx-
imate values of  when we know either sin , cos , or tan . For example, if
we know that cos  = 0.3, then

                               = cos-1(0.3)  1.2661 radians
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                             405

    In other words, we use the sin-1, cos-1, and tan-1 keys to solve trigonomet-
ric equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. Using
one of these keys performs the inverse operation for computing a sine, cosine
or tangent, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.

    Many functions can be described as an operation or as a sequence of
operations on the input value, and this leads us to the notion of an inverse
function.

Inverse of a Function

Raising a number to the nth power and taking nth roots are an example of
inverse operations. For example, if we first cube a number and then take the
cube root of the result, we return to the original number.

We say that the two functions f (x) = x3 and g(x) = 3 x are inverse

functions. Each of the functions undoes the results of the other function.

You can confirm this behavior by consulting the tables of values for the two

functions.

            x f (x) = x3      x g(x) = 3 x

            -2       -8       -8          -2

            -1       -1       -1          -1

            -  1     -  1     -  1  -     1

               2        8        8        2

            0        0        0           0

            1        1        1           1

            2        8        8           2

            1        1        1           1

            2        8        8           2

Observe that the table of values for g(x) = 3 x can be obtained from the

table for f (x) = x3 by interchanging the values of x and y in each ordered pair.

In fact, we can often find a formula for the inverse function by interchanging

the input and output variables in the formula for the function, and then solving

for the new output variable.

For our example, we start with the formula for the cubing function:

            y = x3            Interchange x and y.
            x = y3            Solve for y.
            y = 3 x           A formula for the inverse function.

We use the notation f -1(x) to denote the inverse function. Thus, we have
just shown that the inverse function for f (x) = x3 is f -1(x) = 3 x.

Caution 8.21 The notation f -1(x) does not mean 1 !
                                                                     f (x)

    For example, if f (x) = x3, we have f -1(x) = 3 x, but 1 f (x) = x3 1 , and we
know that 3 x = x3 1 .

    Although it is true that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal, so that,
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                                   406

for instance, a-2 = 1a2 , the -1 in f -1(x) is not an exponent; this is an entirely
new use for the same symbol.

Example 8.22 Let f (x) =              1  . Find a formula for the inverse function.

                                   x-3

Solution. We interchange the variables in the formula for f (that is, in

y=  1    ) to get x =        1     .

    x-3                      y-3

Now we solve for y in terms of x by taking the reciprocal of both sides.

         1                1
y - 3 = , so y = + 3.
         x                x
The formula for the inverse function is f -1(x) = 1 + 3.

In the examples above, note that f -1(x) =    f (x)                     .
                                                                     g(x)

The Graph of the Inverse

If we graph the function f (x) = x3 and its inverse f -1(x) = 3 x on the same
set of axes, we see that the graphs are related in an interesting way, as shown
below.

                                                  yf (x) = x3     y=x
                                                  4

The graphs are symmetric about the line           2               f -1(x) = 3 x
y = x, which means that if we were to
place a mirror along the line each graph      -2         2     4  x
would be the reflection of the other.
This symmetry occurs because we inter--4          -2
changed the roles of x and y when we
defined the inverse function.

                                                                             -4

    Note that, for this example, both graphs pass the vertical line test, so they
are both graphs of functions.

Example 8.24

a Graph the function f (x) = 1 and its inverse f -1(x) = 1 + 3 on the

                                           -2

b Note that f is undefined at x = 3, and f -1 is undefined at x = 0. Thus,
   the domain of f is all real numbers except 3, and the domain of f -1 is
   all real numbers except 0.

   We can find the range of each function by examining its graph:

     · f has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0, so there is no point on the
         graph with y = 0. Its range is all real numbers except 0.

     · Similarly, there is no point on the graph of f -1 with y = 3, so its
         range is all real numbers except 3.

range of f , and the range of f -1 is the same as the domain of f . This should
seem reasonable, because we obtain the inverse function by interchanging the
values of the input and output variables.

Does Every Function Have an Inverse?

In the Examples above, the inverse of the function turned out to be a function
as well. But this is not always the case. Consider the function F (x) = x2 - 4.
First we'll find a formula for the inverse. We interchange x and y and solve for
y:

                    x = y2 - 4                               y    F   F -1
                   y2 = x - 4                              6    24     x
                                                           4         6
                                                           2
                    y=± x-4
                                            -6 -4 -2
The graphs of F and its inverse are shown                -2
at right. You can see that although F is a               -4
function, its inverse is not.                            -6

    Is there some way to predict whether the inverse of a function will be a
function, too? Yes! In order for the inverse to be a function, its graph must
pass the vertical line test. (Recall that if a graph passes the vertical line test,
there is only one y-value for each value of x.)

    Now, we obtain the inverse by interchanging x and y in the formula for a
function, so the inverse will be a function only if the original function passes
the horizontal line test. A function that passes the horizontal line test is called
one-to-one.

      Horizontal Line Test.

    A function passes the Horizontal Line Test if every horizontal
line intersects the graph at most once. In that case, there is only one
x-value for each y-value, and the function is called one-to-one.

Caution 8.26 It is always the case that we can find the inverse of a function:
we just interchange the domain and range values. However, the important
question is whether the inverse is also a function. If the inverse is a function,
we say that "f has an inverse function." All of this leads us to the following
result.

                                      Inverse Function.

         A function f has an inverse function if and only if f is one-to-one.

Answer. I and III

Restricting the Domain: The Inverse Sine Function

Sometimes it is so important that the inverse be a function that we are willing
to sacrifice part of the original function to achieve this result.

Look again at the graph of F (x) = x2 - 4.                                               yf
If we use only nonnegative x-values for the                                            6
domain, we create a new function,
                                                                                       4 f -1
                                                                                       2

              f (x) = x2 - 4, x  0                          -6 -4 -2                                      x
                                                                        -2                   246
The graph of this new function is shown as
a dashed curve in the figure at right.                                  -4

                                                                                -6

The new function is one-to-one, and its inverse, f -1(x) = x + 4, is also a

function. (We could also have used only negative x-values for the domain, or

some smaller interval, just as long as the resulting function is one-to-one.)

We say that we have restricted the domain of the original function, and

we will use this technique to define inverse functions for the trigonometric

functions.

The sine function is not one-to-one; there are many angles that have the
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                                 410

same sine value. In order to define its inverse function, we must restrict the

domain of the sine to an interval on which the y-values do not repeat. But

there are many candidates for such an interval; which one shall we choose?

    It turns out that the most useful interval is found by starting at x = 0 and

moving as far as we can in either direction until the y-values begin to repeat.

                                          -             
By doing so, we obtain the restricted domain  x  , as shown below.
                                          2             2

these angles can be sin-1(x). This is why the calculator's sin-1 key only gives

The Inverse Cosine and Inverse Tangent Functions

The cosine and tangent functions are also periodic, so, just as with the sine
function, to define their inverse functions we must restrict their domains to
intervals where they are one-to-one. The graph of cosine is shown below.

                                            y
                                        1

                 2        2 -1

    Once again the choice of these intervals is arbitrary. If we start at  = 0
on the cosine graph, we can move in only one direction, either right or left,
without encountering repeated y-values.

    We choose to move in the positive direction, to obtain the interval 0    ,
as shown above. On this domain, the inverse of cosine is a function. Its graph
is shown below.

                      y = cos-1 x y                    y=x

    The range of the inverse cosine function is 0  y  , so it delivers angles
in the first and second quadrants. (Compare to the inverse sine, whose outputs
are angles in the first or fourth quadrants.)

Caution 8.38 In the Examples above, perhaps you noticed that
sin sin-1(x) = x for any value of x in the domain of the inverse sine. In other
words, if we find the inverse sine of a number between -1 and 1, and then
take the sine of the resulting angle, we get the original number back again.
The same is true for the cosine and tangent, so that cos cos-1(x) = x and
tan tan-1(x) = x.

    However, if we apply the functions in the opposite order, we may not get
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES             414

back the original number. For example,

          sin-1 sin 3                   -1 -1  
                           4     = sin  =
                                        24

This inequality occurs because the inverse sine function returns just one of the
                                   -1

many angles whose sine is  , and that angle may not be the angle we started
                                     2

with.
    We summarize the content of the Caution above as follows.

             tan tan-1(x) = x for all x

However,

          sin-1 sin(x) may not be equal to x

          cos-1 cos(x)        may not be equal to x
          tan-1 tan(x)        may not be equal to x

Modeling with Inverse Functions

The inverse trig functions are used to model situations in which an angle is
described in terms of one of its trigonometric ratios.

your eye level. The angle  subtended vertically by the tapestry changes as you
approach the wall.

tapestry and the lines of sight to its bottom and                3

that tan() = , so d =            .

b Because tan() = 3 ,  = tan-1 3 .

Alternate Notations

The inverse sine function, sin-1(x), is also called            1
the arcsine function and denoted by arcsin (x).                        t arcsin t
(This terminology reminds us that the output of the                        1
inverse sine function is an angle, or the arc on a unit
circle determined by that angle, as shown at right.)

    Similarly, the inverse cosine function is sometimes denoted by arccos (x),
and the inverse tangent function by arctan (x). Some computer programs use
the notation asin (x), accos (x), and atan (x).

Simplifying Expressions

The key to simplifying expressions involving inverse trigonometric functions
is to remember that the inverse sine, cosine, or tangent of a number can be
treated as an angle. If we assign a name such as  or  to the inverse trig value,
it can often clarify the computations.

Example 8.43 Evaluate sin cos-1 3 .
                                                  5

Solution.  Let    represent  the  angle  cos-1       3   so  that              =  cos-1  3
                                                      ,                                      , and
                                                     5                                   5

consequently cos() = 3 . Then sin cos-1 3                simplifies to sin(), and we
                  5                                  5

                           3
know that cos() = . If we know one of the trigonometric ratios of an angle,

                           5
we can find all the others, either by using a diagram or by using identities. In
this case we'll use the Pythagorean identity, sin2() + cos2() = 1. We have

                             sin2() +    32
                                               =1

                                         5

and solving for sin() gives us sin() = ±4 . But  = cos-1 3                               is a first
                                         5                                        5

quadrant angle, so its sine is positive. Thus, sin cos-1 3                           4
                                                                            5     =.

                                                                                     5

Answer. 

                  13
    We can verify the results of the previous example using a calculator, but
the same technique can be applied to simplify similar expressions involving
variables.

Example 8.45 Simplify tan[sin-1(x)], assuming that 0  x  1.
Solution. Let  = sin-1(x), so that sin() = x, and we can rewrite the
expression tan[sin-1(x)] as tan(). Now we use identities to write tan() in
terms of x. First, from the Pythagorean identity we know that

and then          cos() = 1 - sin( 2) = 1 - x2
                      tan() = sin() =  x

Concepts

    1 Using one of the calculator keys sin-1, cos-1, or tan-1 performs the
       inverse operation for computing a sine, cosine or tangent.

    2 Two functions are called inverse functions if each "undoes" the results of
       the other function.

    3 If y = f (x) is a function, we can often find a formula for the inverse
       function by interchanging x and y in the formula for the function, and
       then solving for y.

    4 The graphs of y = f (x) and y = f -1(x) are symmetric about the line
       y = x.

    5 The domain of f -1 is the same as the range of f , and the range of f -1 is
       the same as the domain of f .

                A function passes the Horizontal Line Test if every hori-
            zontal line intersects the graph at most once. In that case, there
            is only one x-value for each y-value, and the function is called
            one-to-one.

7 A function f has an inverse function if and only if f is one-to-one.

a fraction that it is convenient to give names to their reciprocals. We define
three new trigonometric functions as follows.

position, and P (x, y) is a point on the terminal side, then we define the following

    Calculators do not have keys for the secant, cosecant, and cotangent func-
tions; instead, we calculate their values as reciprocals.

Example 8.50 Use a calculator to approximate sec(47) to three decimal
places.

Solution. With the calculator in degree mode, enter
                       1 ÷ COS 47 ) ENTER

    to obtain sec(47)  1.466. Or we can calculate cos(47) first, and then use
the reciprocal key:

                       COS 47 ) ENTER x-1 ENTER

Checkpoint 8.51 Use a calculator to approximate csc(132) to three decimal
places.

Answer. 1.346
    Of course, we can also evaluate the reciprocal trig functions for angles in

radians, or for real numbers. Thus for example,

csc(3.5) =  1         = -2.8508 and cot(-4) =                 1     = -0.8637

            sin(3.5)                                       tan(-4)

In particular, the exact values for the reciprocal trig functions of the special
angles are easily obtained.

Caution 8.52 The reciprocal functions are not the same as the inverse trig

functions!

For example, sec(0.8) is not equal to cos-1(0.8). Remember that

cos-1(0.8) is an angle, namely the angle whose cosine is 0.8, while sec(0.8)

is the reciprocal of the cosine of 0.8 radians, or  1         . You can check on

                                                    cos(0.8)

your calculator that

              cos-1(0.8) = 0.6435 radians, and sec(0.8) = 1.4353

    Each of the reciprocal functions is undefined when its denominator is equal
to zero. For example, the secant is undefined when cos() = 0, or when  is an
odd multiple of 90.

Example 8.53 For which angles is the cosecant undefined?

Solution. The cosecant is undefined when its denominator, sin(), equals
zero, and sin() = 0 when  is a multiple of 180. In radians, csc() is undefined
if  is a multiple of .

Checkpoint 8.54 For what angles is the cotangent undefined? Give your
answers in degrees and in radians.
Answer. Multiples of 180, or multiples of .

Note 8.55 Although tan     is undefined, cot     = 0.

Application to Right Triangles

In Chapter 2 we defined three trigonometric ratios for an acute angle; namely,
sine, cosine, and tangent. When we take the reciprocals of those ratios, we
obtain expressions for the secant, cosecant, and cotangent.

                          Reciprocal Trigonometric Ratios.

         If  is one of the acute angles in a right triangle,

csc() =

               opposite
             adjacent
cot() =
             opposite

    Although we can express any relationship between the sides of a right
triangle using sine, cosine, and tangent, sometimes it is more convenient to use
one of the reciprocal functions.

Example 8.56

flagpole on a sunny day depends on the

, that the sun's rays make with ground.            L

a Write an expression for the length, L, of the shadow cast by a flagpole of
   height h when the sun makes an angle of  from the ground.

b Find the length (to the nearest 0.01 meter) of the shadow cast by a
   3-meter flagpole when the sun makes an angle of 20 from the ground.

                                L = 3 cot(20) = 3(2.7475) = 8.24

       The shadow is about 8.24 meters long.

Graphs of the Reciprocal Functions

We can obtain graphs of the reciprocal trig functions by plotting points, as we
did for the sine, cosine and tangent functions. However, it is more enlightening
to construct these graphs as the reciprocals of the three basic functions.

Example 8.58 Use the graph of y = cos(x) to construct a graph of f (x) =
sec(x).

Solution. Consider the graph of y = cos(x) shown at left below.

                    -              3
When x = , and , cos(x) = 0, so sec(x) is undefined at these
                    22             2
x-values, and we insert vertical asymptotes at those x-values to start our graph

of y = sec(x), as shown at right below.

                      y                                                 y

                   2                          x                      2                       x
                   1          2 3                                    1       2 3

-3 -2 --1                                         -3 -2 --1
                 -2                                                -2

To find some points on the graph, we look at points on the graph of

y = cos(x). At each x-value, the y-coordinate of the point on the graph of

y = sec(x) is the reciprocal of cos(x).

For  example,         at  x  =  0  and  x  =  2,  we  have  cos(x)  =   1,  so  sec(x)  =  1  =  1.
                                                                                           1

Thus, we plot the points (0, 1) and (2, 1) on the graph of f (x) = sec(x).
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                                                                430

Similarly,  at  x  =  -  and  x  =  ,  cos(x)           =  -1,  so  the  value  of  sec(x)   is   1  =    -1,
                                                                                                 -1

and we plot the points (-, -1) and (, -1) on the graph of f (x) = sec(x).

    Finally, we notice that the values of cos(x) are decreasing toward 0 as x
                           

increases from 0 to , so the graph of f (x) = sec(x) increases toward  on
                           2

the same interval.

By similar arguments, we fill in the graph of f (x) = sec(x) between each of

the vertical asymptotes, to produce the graph below.

                                                     y

                                              1
                   -3 -2                                                 2      3
                                    -
                                           -1
                                           -2

                                           -2

    The graphs of the three new functions are shown below, with x in radians.
                                                                                     

Note that the secant function is undefined at odd multiples of , the values
                                                                                     2

at which cos(x) = 0. The cosecant is undefined where sin(x) = 0, namely at
multiples of . The cotangent is also undefined at multiples of , because
tan(x) = 0 at those values.

Example 8.60 State the domain and range of the secant function.

Solution. Because the cosine is defined for all real numbers, the domain of

the secant includes all real numbers except for values where the cosine is zero.

                                                                     3 5
These values are the odd multiples of , that is, , , , . . ., and their
                                                        2           22 2
opposites.

Because the range of the cosine consists of all y-values with -1  y  1, the
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                                 431

range of the secant includes the reciprocals of those values, namely y  1 and
y  -1.

Checkpoint 8.61 State the domain and range of the cosecant and cotangent
functions.

Answer. Domain of cosecant: all real numbers except integer multiples of ;
Range of cosecant: (-, -1]  [1, )

    Domain of cotangent: all real numbers except integer multiples of ; Range
of cotangent: all real numbers

Solving Equations

From the graph of the secant function, we can see that the equation sec() = k

has two solutions between 0 and 2 if k  1 or k  -1, but no solution for

-1 < k < 1. The same is true of the cosecant function: the equation csc() = k

has no solution for -1 < k < 1.

Example 8.62 Solve                      for  between 0 and 2.
                                   23
                       csc() =

                                     3

Solution. We take the reciprocal of each side of the equation to obtain

                                        3         3

                               sin() =  =

Because is one of the special values, we recognize that one of the solutions
         2

is  = . The sine and the cosecant are also positive in the second quadrant,
         3
                                        2

so the second solution is  - = .

Checkpoint 8.63 Solve sec() = -1.6 for  between 0 and 2.

Answer.  = 2.25, 4.04

Using Identities

All six of the trigonometric ratios are related. If we know one of the ratios, we
can use identities to find any of the others.

                                                 
Example 8.64 If sec() = 3, and -    0, find an exact value for csc().

                                                 2

Solution. Because sec() =          1  , we see that     1                   1
                                                               = 3, or cos() = .
                               cos()                    cos()               3

We use the Pythagorean identity to find the sine.

cos2() + sin2() = 1                                  1
                                      Substitute for cos().
   1 + sin2 2 () = 1
   3                                                 3

            sin2() = 1 - 1 = 8        Subtract    12 1
                               99                       = from both sides.
                                                  3        9

Because  lies in the fourth quadrant, where the sine function is negative, we

choose the negative square root for sin(). Once we know sin(), we calculate

its reciprocal to find csc().

                                                     1

Answer. sec() =

Identities are especially useful if the trig ratios are algebraic expressions,

rather than numerical values. In the next example, we use the cotangent

identity.

                            Cotangent Identity.

                  cot() =    1        =  cos()  ,   sin() = 0

                            tan() sin()

                                                           
Example 8.66 If csc(x) = w and 0 < x < , find an expression for cot(x).

                                                           2

Solution. Because the sine is the reciprocal of the cosecant, we have sin(x) =

1           1                1
      = . We substitute for sin(x) in the Pythagorean identity to find
csc(x) w                     w

                  cos(x) = ± 1 - sin2(x) = ± 1 - 1 2
                                                                   w

We choose the positive root because cosine is positive in the first quadrant, and
simplify to get

                                   1        w2 - 1         w2 - 1
                             1 - w2 =
                  cos(x) =                      w2 = |w|

We can replace |w| by w in this last expression because w > 0. (Do you see

why w > 0?) Finally, because the cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent, we

have                                     w2 - 1

                     cot(x) = cos(x) = w = w2 - 1
                             sin(x)         1

                                            w

                                   2     3
Checkpoint 8.67 If sec(t) = and < t < 2, find expressions for csc(t)
                                   a     2
and cot(t).

Answer. csc(t) =  -2 , cot(t) =  -a
                     1 - a2                 1 - a2

We can often simplify trigonometric expressions by first converting all the

trig ratios to sines and cosines.

Example 8.68 Simplify sec() - tan() sin().

Solution. We replace sec() by            1      and tan() by          sin()  to get

                                         cos()                        cos()

               1  -  sin()  · sin() =    1      -  sin2()

            cos() cos()                  cos() cos()
CHAPTER 8. MORE FUNCTIONS AND IDENTITIES                            433

                              =      1 - sin2() cos2()
                                                 =         = cos()
                                         cos()      cos()

   In the previous example, you can verify that

                 sec() - tan() sin() = cos()

by graphing the functions Y1 = sec() - tan() sin() and Y2 = cos() to see
that they are the same.

Checkpoint 8.69 Show that sin2(x)(1 + cot2(x)) = 1.

Answer.  2           2           2              cos2(x)    = sin2(x) + cos2(x) =
         sin (x)(1 + cot (x)) = sin (x) 1 + 2
                                                sin (x)

   There are two alternate versions of the Pythagorean identity which involve

the reciprocal trig functions. These identities are useful when we know the

value of tan() or cot() and want to find the other trig values.

            Two More Pythagorean Identities.

         1 + tan2() = sec2()                 1 + cot2() = csc2()

    You can memorize these identities, but they are easy to derive from the
original Pythagorean identity, sin2() + cos2() = 1. We will prove them in the
Homework problems.

                                         3
Example 8.70 If tan() = and  lies in the third quadrant, find exact

                                         5
values for sec() and cos().

Solution. We cannot find the sine and cosine of an angle directly from the
value of the tangent; in particular, it is not true that sin() = 3 and cos() = 5!
(Do you see why?) Instead, we begin with the Pythagorean identity for the
tangent.

                 sec2() = 1 + tan2() = 1 + ( 3 )2
                                                        5

                              25 9 34
                            =+=
                              25 25 25
                                             
                                     34 ± 34
                 sec() = ±               =
                                     25      5

Because  is in the third quadrant, both its sine and cosine are negative.

Therefore the reciprocals of cosine and sine, namely secant and cosecant, must
                                     - 34
also be negative, and hence sec() =          . The cosine of  is the reciprocal
                                         5
                        -5
of the secant, so cos() =  .

exact values for csc() and sin().

                                                                  1

                                                   csc() =
                                                               sin()
                                                                   1

                                                   cot() =
                                                                tan()

4 We can obtain graphs of the secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions as
   the reciprocals of the three basic functions.

5 We can solve equations of the form sec() = k, csc() = k, and cot() = k
   by taking the reciprocal of both sides.

6 If we know one of the trigonometric ratios for an angle, we can use
   identities to find any of the others.

                 cot() =  1      =       cos()  ,  sin() = 0

                          tan() sin()

                        Two More Pythagorean Identities.

            1 + tan2() = sec2()          1 + cot2() = csc2()

9 We can often simplify trigonometric expressions by first converting all
   the trig ratios to sines and cosines.

Study Questions

1 Delbert says that sec(x) is just another way of writing cos-1(x), because

cos-1(x) =       1
                      . Is he correct? Explain your reasoning.

    1 Identities are useful for changing from one form to another when solving
       equations, for simplifying expressions, and for finding exact values for
       trigonometric functions.

 6 Two functions are called inverse functions if each "undoes" the results of
    the other function.

 7 If y = f (x) is a function, we can often find a formula for the inverse
    function by interchanging x and y in the formula for the function, and
    then solving for y.

 8 The graphs of y = f (x) and y = f -1(x) are symmetric about the line
    y = x.

 9 The domain of f -1 is the same as the range of f , and the range of f -1 is
    the same as the domain of f .

                                    Horizontal Line Test.

             A function passes the Horizontal Line Test if every hori-
         zontal line intersects the graph at most once. In that case, there
         is only one x-value for each y-value, and the function is called
         one-to-one.

11 A function f has an inverse function if and only if f is one-to-one.

             However,

                           sin-1(sin(x)) may not be equal to x
                           cos-1(cos(x)) may not be equal to x
                           tan-1(tan(x)) may not be equal to x

14 The inverse sine function is also called the arcsine function and denoted
    by arcsin(x). Similarly, the inverse cosine function is sometimes denoted
    by arccos(x), and the inverse tangent function by arctan(x).

15 When simplifying expressions involving inverse trigonometric functions,
    it can often clarify the computations if we assign a name such as  or

                                   Three More Functions.

    If  is an angle in standard position, and P (x, y) is a point on
the terminal side, then we define the following functions.

 The secant :                r              y
The cosecant :   sec() =
The cotangent :                                
                             x                            x
                             r
                 csc() =                  r
                             y       P (x, y)
                              x
                  cot() =
                              y

                        Reciprocal Trigonometric Functions.

 The secant function :                              1
The cosecant function :              sec() =
The cotangent function :
                                                 cos()
                                                    1

                                     csc() =
                                                 sin()
                                                     1

                                     cot() =
                                                  tan()

19 We can obtain graphs of the secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions as
    the reciprocals of the three basic functions.

20 We can solve equations of the form sec() = k, csc() = k, and cot() = k
    by taking the reciprocal of both sides.

21 If we know one of the trigonometric ratios for an angle, we can use
    identities to find any of the others.

                          Two More Pythagorean Identities.

            1 + tan2() = sec2()            1 + cot2() = csc2()

24 We can often simplify trigonometric expressions by first converting all
    the trig ratios to sines and cosines.

Vectors

   · Geometric Form
   · Coordinate Form
   · The Dot Product

    A vector is a mathematical tool that indicates both a direction and a size,
or magnitude. Vectors are often represented visually as arrows. For example,
we can use vectors to indicate the speed and direction of the wind. You may
see weather maps like the ones below.

    Usually the magnitude of the vector, (the wind speed in this example), is
shown by the length of the arrow, but sometimes a color key makes the map
easier to read.

    Of particular interest are the winds produced by tropical storms, or hurri-
canes and the forces that create the storm. Near the Earth's surface, winds
spiral towards the center of a hurricane. They rotate in a counterclockwise di-
rection in the Northern Hemisphere and in a clockwise direction in the Southern
Hemisphere.

                                                 453

    · friction.
    The center, or eye, of a hurricane contains the lowest atmospheric pressure,
so the pressure gradient pulls air towards the center of the hurricane. In the
Northern Hemisphere, this air is deflected towards the right because of the
Coriolis force, a result of the Earth's own rotation. As the air turns to the
right, the primary circulation around a hurricane begins to develop.

    Hurricane researchers know that strong vertical wind shear is a major factor
affecting potential hurricane development. Wind shear is the variation of the
wind's speed or direction over a short distance within the atmosphere. If there is
too much wind, a storm has trouble developing into a cyclone. With little or no
wind shear, the turning within the tropical system becomes vertically aligned,
helping to keep it intact. Thus, the most favorable condition for tropical cyclone
development is the absence of wind shear.

    Using simple mathematical models, researchers can estimate the degree to
which the center of the storm becomes vertically tilted, based on the cloudiness
within the eyewall and the structure of the wind outside the eyewall. By
modeling the development of storm tilt, a better understanding of a tropical
cyclone's behavior is gained in the presence and absence of wind shear. In
particular, an El Niño weather system creates changes in the jet stream over
the Northern Hemisphere, resultingin decreased wind shear in the Pacific and
increased wind shear across much of the Atlantic basin, which suppresses
hurricane activity.

    These model simulations show promise in understanding the processes
driving the intensity of tropical cyclones.

9.1 Geometric Form

Introduction

One way to specify a location is to give a direction and a distance from a
fixed landmark. For example, we might say that the airport is located 8 miles
northeast of the town hall, or that a ship has been sighted 20 miles from the
lighthouse in the direction 10° west of north. It's not enough to give just the
distance to the object or just the direction; we need both to describe the object's
location.

    In mathematics, a quantity defined by both a magnitude (such as a distance)
and a direction is called a vector. A vector used to designate location relative
to a fixed landmark, as in the examples above, is called a position vector.
Vectors are also used to analyze motion and velocity in two or three dimensions,
to study forces such as gravity and electric fields, and to design computer
graphics and animation.

    We often illustrate a vector by an arrow. The length of the arrow represents
the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the vector is indicated by the
head of the arrow.

Example 9.1 Draw an arrow to represent each vector.

    a The campsite is 3 miles away, in a direction 30 north of east.

    b The wind is blowing due west at 50 kilometers per hour.

Solution.
    a We draw an arrow making an angle of 30 from east. The length of the
       arrow is 3 units, representing 3 miles. See figure (a) below.

b We draw an arrow pointing due west, that is, making an angle of 180
   from east. The length of the arrow represents the speed of the wind, 50
   kilometers per hour. See figure (b) above.

Notation for Vectors

In print, we use boldface characters such as u and v to represent vectors. When
writing by hand, we use an arrow above a variable to indicate that it is a vector,
like this: v.

    It is important to distinguish vector quantities from quantities that have
magnitude only, such as length or temperature. These quantities are called
scalars. They are the constants and variables you are used to dealing with,
which are usually denoted by italic letters such as x or k.

    The length of a vector v is called its magnitude, and is denoted by v .

Caution 9.3 Note that the magnitude of a vector is a scalar quantity. Thus,
v denotes a vector, but v denotes a scalar.

Two vectors may have the same length, but point in

different directions. The figure at right shows two vectors,

u and v, that have the same magnitude but different           u

directions. For this example, u = v , but u = v. Two

vectors are equal if and only if they have the same length            v

and the same direction, but they can start at different

locations. The fact that we can move vectors from one

location to another is a useful property.

Example 9.4

Which of the vectors shown at right are    ab c                  d
equal?                                        g                    e

                                                              f

Solution. Only vectors c and g are equal. Vectors b, c, and f are all the
same length but have different directions. Vectors a and d also have equal
lengths but different directions. Vectors d and e have the same direction but
different lengths.

Scalar Multiplication of Vectors

We can multiply a vector by a scalar. The figure below shows the vector w and
the vector v = 3w. Multiplying by a positive scalar changes the length of a
vector but not its direction.

                                                   wu
                                                 v

    Thus, the vector v is 3 times as long as the vector w. If we multiply a
vector by a negative scalar, we alter its length and reverse its direction; that is,
we change the direction by 180. For example, the vector u = - 12 w. It is half
the length of w, and points in the opposite direction.

    In general, if k is a real number, then kv represents the vector with magni-
tude k times the magnitude of v. It points in the same direction as v when
k > 0 and in the opposite direction from v when k < 0. Real numbers are
called scalars because they "scale" vectors in this way, and multiplying a scalar
times a vector is called scalar multiplication.

Example 9.6

The figure at right shows the vector v and two           23 v
                                                     v
scalar multiples of v.
The vector 23 v points in the same direction as                  
v, but is only two-thirds as long as the vector                - 3v
v. The vector - 3v points in the direction
opposite to v and is 3 or approximately 1.7

times as long as v.

                                                   -2
    Note that because v has a slope of , so does any nonzero multiple of v.

Addition of Vectors

A displacement vector represents the change in position from one point to
another.

For example, suppose you leave home and travel 6 miles     N                    w
east and then 8 miles north. These two displacements            E                     v
are represented by the vectors u and v shown at right.

When we follow one displacement vector by a second                                      8 mi

one, the net displacement is a new vector, w, starting

at the base of the first vector and ending at the head of                       
the second vector.                                                              6 mi u

    In this example, notice that w forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so
we can calculate its magnitude and direction.

                  w 2 = u 2 + v 2 = 62 + 82 = 100

                  w = 10

                              84            = 53.1
                  tan() = =

                              63
                         = tan-1 4

                                         3

The net displacement gives your current position relative to home: 10 miles
in the direction 53.1 north of east. When we follow one vector by a second
vector as described above, we are adding the two vectors. The sum is called
the resultant vector.

Example 9.8 For each pair of vectors, draw the resultant vector w = u + v.

you start off from your campground at point C                   A

and hike 4 miles southwest to point B. After                          

taking a break, you continue hiking, and this             3 mi     4 mi
time you cover 3 miles in the direction 30 east        N

of north, and arrive at point A, as shown at            30

right. What is your position relative to the

campground?                                      B

Solution. The resultant vector, w, forms the side opposite a 15 angle. We
use the law of cosines to compute its length.

                   w 2 = 42 + 32 - 2(4)(3) cos 15
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                       460

                                  = 16 + 9 - 24(0.9659) = 1.81778

                  
Thus, w = 1.81778 = 1.348, so you are 1.348 miles from the campground.
To find the direction back to the campground, we use the law of sines to
calculate the angle at C.

                       sin(C) sin 15
                          =
                       3         1.348

                       sin(C) =  3 sin 15  = 0.5759

                                 1.348

                          C = sin-1(0.5759) = 35.2

The angle labeled  in the figure is 45 - 35.2 = 9.9, so at point A you are
1.348 miles from camp in the direction 9.8 south of west.

Checkpoint 9.11 Delbert has gone sailing with friends. After leaving the
marina, they sail for 5 miles on a bearing of 160 and stop at Gull Island for
lunch. (Recall that bearings are measured clockwise from north.) After lunch,
they have sailed for 3 miles on a bearing of 25 when they get a phone call to
return home. What bearing is the most direct route back to the marina, and
how far is it?

Answer. 56.4 W of N, 3.58 mi

    It doesn't matter which order we choose to add two vectors. As with the
ordinary addition of scalars, the addition of vectors is commutative, so that
u + v = v + u. To see this, first draw u and v starting at the same point.

          v               · To represent u + v, we place the base of v at
                    u        the head of u, and draw the resultant vector
                             u + v as shown at left.
   u+v

u                         · To represent v + u, we place the base of u at

   v                             the head of v, and the resultant vector v + u

                                 is the same as the vector u + v.

Because the vector sum forms the diagonal of a parallelogram in this picture,

the rule for adding vectors is sometimes called the parallelogram rule.

We summarize the operations on vectors as follows.

                       Operations on Vectors.

   1 We can multiply a vector, v, by a scalar, k.

         a If k > 0, the magnitude of kv is k times the magnitude of v.
            The direction of kv is the same as the direction of v.

         b If k < 0, the direction of kv is opposite the direction of v.

   2 We can add two vectors v andw with the parallelogram rule.

Caution 9.12 Unless u and v are parallel vectors, it is not true that the
length of u + v is just the sum of the lengths of u and v. Vector addition is a
geometric operation; the length of u + v depends on the lengths of u and v and
on the angle between them. Be careful to distinguish between regular addition
of scalars, such as u + v , and vector addition, u + v, which requires the
parallelogram rule.

Velocity

Physicists and mathematicians use the word velocity to mean not simply speed
but the combination of speed and direction of motion. The interesting thing
about velocities is that they add like vectors; if an object's motion consists of
two simultaneous components, the resulting displacement is the same as if the
motions had occurred one after the other.

    For example, imagine a beetle walking across a moving conveyor belt, as
shown in figure (a) below. The conveyor belt is moving at a speed of 4 inches
per second, and the beetle walks at right angles to the motion of the belt at
2 inches per second. After 1 second, the beetlehas traveled from his starting
point at P to point Q, distance of 22 + 42 = 20, or about 4.47 inches. His
actual velocity relative to the ground is 4.47 inches per second at an angle of
 = tan-1( 24 ) = 26.6 from the direction of the conveyor belt.

    Notice that if the two motions were performed in succession instead of
simultaneously, as shown in figure (b), the resulting displacement would be the
same. In other words, if the beetle had walked across the belt for 1 second
before it started moving, and then ridden the belt for 1 second without walking,
he would still end up at point Q.

    Thus, velocity is a vector quantity, and we can calculate the result of
two simultaneous motions by using the parallelogram rule. We treat the two
motions as if they had occurred one after the other, by starting one vector at
the endpoint of the other. (Remember we can move a vector from one location
to another, as long as we preserve its length and direction.)

Example 9.13 A ship travels at 15 miles per hour relative to the water on a
bearing of 280. The water current flows at 6 miles per hour on a bearing of
160. What is the actual speed and direction of the ship?

Solution. We represent the ship's velocity by a vector v and the velocity of
the water current by vector w, as shown in figure (a). The actual motion of
the ship is the sum of these two vectors, and we can calculate the sum just as
if the two motions had occurred separately, one after the other.

    So we will add w to v by placing the base of w at the head of v, as shown
in figure (b). The resultant vector, u, represents the actual motion of the ship.

                 N                             N

v                       v 10
             15  280 160 E w 20  E

                    6  u

a. w b.

    We first calculate the angle  between the two vectors v and w. Because
 = 10, we have 20 +  = 90, so  = 60. Now we can use the law of cosines

to find u .

                 u 2 = v 2 + w 2 - 2 v w cos 
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                     462

                                 = 152 + 62 - 2(15)(6) cos(60)
                                 = 171
                         
The ship's speed is 171  13.1 mph. Next we use the law of sines to calculate
the ship's bearing.

              sin() sin()
                       =
              6           u

                             sin(60)
              sin() = 6 ·  = 0.3974

                                  171

                        = sin-1(0.3974) = 23.5

The direction of the ship is  - 10 = 13.4 south of due west, or on bearing
256.6.

Checkpoint 9.14 A plane heads due north at an airspeed of 120 miles per
hour. There is a 45 mph wind traveling 5 south of due east. What are the
plane's actual speed and direction relative to the ground?

Answer. 56.4 W of N, 3.58 mi

    In some situations, instead of calculating a vector sum, we would like to
find a vector to produce a particular sum. That is, we know vectors u and w,
and we want to find a vector v so that u + v = w.

Example 9.15 Barbara wants to travel west to an island at a speed of 15
miles per hour. However, she must compensate for a current running 45 east
of north at a speed of 3 miles per hour. In what direction and at what speed
should Barbara head her boat?

Solution. We draw a triangle using vectors to represent the desired velocity
of Barbara's boat, w, and the velocity of the current, u, as shown below. We
would like to find a vector v that represents the speed and heading Barbara
should take in order to compensate for the current.

    We first use the law of cosines to calculate the length or magnitude of the
vector v. The angle at C is 135. (Do you see why?). Thus,

                                                                       N

v 2 = 32 + 152 - 2(3)(15) cos(135) N  C            15

    = 297.64                          45                               B
v = 17.25
                                         3      v

                                 D

So Barbara should travel at about 17.25 miles per hour.
To find her heading, we use the law of sines to calculate the angle .

              sin() sin(45)
                       =
                    3     15

              sin() =     3(0, 7071)  = 0.1414

                             15

                        = sin-1(0.1414) = 8.1

Barbara should head her boat about 8.1 south of west, or at a bearing of
261.9.

Checkpoint 9.16 Ahab would like to sail at 20 kilometers per hour due west
towards a whale reported at that position. However, a steady ocean current is
moving 52 east of north at 8 kilometers per hour. At what speed and heading
should Ahab sail?

Answer. 26.76 kph 10.6 S of W

Components of a Vector

We have seen that we can add two vectors to get a third or resultant vector.
We can also break down a vector into two or more component vectors. For
many applications, it is useful to break a vector into horizontal and vertical
components.

For example, the beetle on the conveyor belt        y
moved at 4.47 inches per second in the direction
26.6. If we set up coordinate axes as shown at               v        vy = 2 in/sec
right, the vector v representing his velocity is       vx = 4 in/sec       x
the sum of the beetle's motion in the x-direction,
vx, at 4 inches per second, and his motion in
the y-direction, vy, at 2 inches per second.

    We can break down any vector into its x- and y-components, and the sum of
those components is equal to the original vector. In other words, v = vx + vy.

    The horizontal and vertical vectors vx and vy are called the vector com-
ponents of v. If we designate the direction of v by an angle  measured
counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis, then the scalar quantities given by

                        vx = v cos()

                        vy = v sin()

are called simply the components of the vector v.
    Note that the components vx and vy of a vector are scalars; they are not

vectors themselves. They can be either positive or negative (or zero), as shown
below.

           y            y           y                  y

              vv                                    x                 x

                     x           x  v                         v
                                       vx < 0          vx > 0
           vx > 0       vx < 0         vy < 0          vy < 0
           vy > 0       vy > 0

Example 9.17 A plane flies at 300 miles per hour in the direction 30 north
of west. Find the x- and y-components of its velocity.

Solution.

We draw a triangle showing the plane's velocity, v,                      y
as the sum of components in the x- and y-directions, v
as shown at right. In this coordinate system, the              vy           150
angle  is 150. Because the components are the              300                   x
legs of a right triangle, we have vx
                                                          30

                        vx = 300 cos(150) = -259.81
                        vy = 300 sin(150) = 150

Checkpoint 9.18 The wind is blowing 50 kilometers per hour in a direction
10 south of due west. Find the x- and y-components of its velocity.

Answer. vx  -49.2 kph, vy  -8.7 kph
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                              464

Using Components

We can describe a vector completely using either magnitude and direction
or components. Many calculations with vectors are simpler when we use
components. For example, to add two vectors using components, we don't need
the laws of sines and cosines. We resolve each vector into its horizontal and
vertical components, add the corresponding components, then compute the
magnitude and direction of the resultant vector.

    To calculate magnitude and direction from the components, we need only
right triangle trigonometry.

v = (vx)2 + (vy)2 and tan() = vy
                                                     vx

Example 9.19 After flying for some time, the airplane in the previous example
encounters a steady wind blowing at 40 miles per hour from 10 south of west.
What are the actual speed and heading of the airplane relative to the ground?

Solution. We would like to add the vectors v, representing the plane's in-
tended velocity, and u, representing the velocity of the wind. We first resolve u
into its components.

             ux = 40 cos(10) = 39.30                            y
             uy = 40 sin(10) = 6.95
                                                v uw           wy vy
We find the components of the resultant, w, by
adding the components of u and v, as shown           300           
at right. That is,                                         30
                                                                150
                                                vx wx                        x

                                                                    u
                                                                       10

wx = ux + vx = 39.30 - 259.81 = -220.51
wy = uy + vy = 6.95 + 150 = 156.95

Finally, we compute the magnitude and direction of the resultant.

                   w 2 = (-220.51)2 + (156.95)2 = 73, 257.96
                    w = 270.66

So, the ground speed of the airplane is 272.41 miles per hour.
    To find its heading, , we compute

tan() =             156.95   = -0.7118

                    -220.51

Because  is a second-quadrant angle, we have

 = tan-1(-0.7118) + 180 = 145

The plane flies in the direction 145, or 35 north of west.

Caution 9.20 In the previous example, the airplane's heading is not
tan-1(-0.7254) = -36. Remember that there are always two angles with a
given tangent. We can refer to a sketch of the vector or to the signs of its
components to decide which of those two angles is appropriate.

Checkpoint 9.21 A plane is flying in a wind blowing 50 kilometers per hour
in a direction 10 south of due west. The plane has an airspeed of 200 kph and
heading 142 What is the ground speed and actual direction of the plane?

Concepts

    1 A quantity defined by both a magnitude (such as a distance) and a
       direction is called a vector.

    2 Two vectors are equal if they have the same length and direction; it does
       not matter where the vector starts.

    3 The length of a vector v is called its magnitude, and is denoted by v .

    4 The sum of two vectors u and v is a new vector, w, starting at the tail
       of the first vector and ending at the head of the second vector. The sum
       is called the resultant vector.

    5 Addition of vectors is commutative. The rule for adding vectors is
       sometimes called the parallelogram rule.
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS  466

                            Operations on Vectors.

6 1 We can multiply a vector, v, by a scalar, k.

              a If k > 0, the magnitude of kv is k times the magnitude
                 of v. The direction of kv is the same as the direction
                 of v.

              b If k < 0, the direction of kv is opposite the direction of
                 v.

       2 We can add two vectors v andw with the parallelogram rule.

    7 Any vector can be written as the sum of its horizontal and vertical vector
       components, vx and vy.

    8 The components of a vector v whose direction is given by the angle 
       in standard position are the scalar quantities

                                              vx = v cos 
                                              vy = v sin 
    9 The magnitude and direction of a vector with components and are given
       by
                            v = (vx)2 + (vy)2 and tan  = vy

   10 To add two vectors using components, we can resolve each vector into its

       horizontal and vertical components, add the corresponding components,
       then compute the magnitude and direction of the resultant.

      How far is Esther from her starting point, and in what direction?

36. Rani paddles her canoe 4.5 miles in the direction 12 west of north.

37. Brenda wants to fly to an airport that is 103 miles due west in 1 hour.
      The prevailing winds blow in the direction 112 east of north at 28

      will move him 160 meters due south compared with where his speed
      and direction would take him if the current stopped. Compute the

    Multiplying a vector v by -1 gives a vector -v that has the same magnitude
as v but points in the opposite direction. We define subtraction of two vectors
the same way we define subtraction of integers:

                                       u - v = u + (-v)

That is, to subtract a vector v, we add its opposite.

9.2 Coordinate Form

Introduction

In Section 9.1 we saw how to resolve a vector into horizontal and vertical
components. Thus, every vector can be expressed as the sum of a horizontal
vector and a vertical vector.
Example 9.22 A vector w has magnitude 4 and direction  = 29, where  is
measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis. Express w as the sum of
a horizontal vector, wx, and a vertical vector, wy.
Solution. The components of w are given by
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                              471

wx = w cos()                                 y
    = 4 cos(29) = 3.50
                                         1.94 w

                                         wy           4

wy = w sin()                                          29                  x
    = 4 sin(29) = 1.94                                   wx        3.50

    Then w = wx + wy, where wx is a horizontal vector of magnitude 3.50,
and wy is a vertical vector of magnitude 1.94. See the figure above.

Checkpoint 9.23 A vector u has magnitude 2 and direction  = 116, where
 is in standard position. Express u as the sum of a horizontal vector, ux, and
a vertical vector, uy.

Answer. u = ux + uy, where ux = -1.943, uy = 0.473

Unit Vectors

It is often useful to describe a vector by giving its horizontal and vertical
components, instead of its magnitude and direction. To make the notation
easier, we give names to the vectors of length 1 that point in the x- and y-
directions. A vector of magnitude 1 is called a unit vector. We can have unit
vectors in any direction, but the unit vector in the x-direction is denoted by i,
and the unit vector in the y-direction is called j, as shown below.

By taking scalar multiples of i and j, we can de-       y             (4, 3)
scribe any vector that lies in the directions of the  3            v
coordinate axes. For example, 4i represents the vec-
tor of magnitude 4 pointing in the x-direction, and       3j        4i x
3j represents the vector of magnitude 3 pointing in                      4
they-direction. And by adding multiples of i and      j
j, we can represent any vector we like. The vector
v = 4i + 3j is shown at right.                                i

    Because the components of the vector are chosen to align with the coordinate
system, we call this the coordinate form of the vector.

              Coordinate Form of a Vector.

The vector

                        v = ai + bj

is the vector whose horizontal component is a and whose vertical com-
ponent is b.

    The coordinate form of the vector w in the previous example is w =
3.50i + 1.94j.

Example 9.24

State the coordinate form of the vector                         y
shown at right.                                       v

Solution.  From its base to its tip, the vector extends 4 units in the negative
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                     472

i direction and 6 units in the j direction. Thus, v = -4i + 6j.
Checkpoint 9.25

State the coordinate form of the vector           y
shown at right.                                                  x

                                              -5    w

Answer. w = 3i - 5j

Converting Between Geometric and Coordinate Form

It is a simple matter to find the magnitude and direction of a vector given in
coordinate form. The vector v = 4i + 3j has magnitude

                                                          
                                  v = 32 + 42 = 25 = 5

and direction  = tan-1 3 = 36.9. Thus, we can readily convert vectors
                                   4

from geometric form to coordinate form or vice versa.

Comparing the Geometric and Coordinate Forms of a Vector.

    Suppose that the vector v has magnitude v and points in the
direction of the angle  in standard position. If v has the coordinate
form v = ai + bj, then

a = v cos()                                   v = a2 + b2
b = v sin()                                             b

                                         tan() =
                                                        a

Example 9.26

    a Find the geometric form of the vector w = -3i - 2j.

    b Find the coordinate form of the vector whose magnitude is 5 and whose
       direction is the angle  = 135.

Solution.

                                                                            
    a The magnitude of w is w = (-3)2 + (-2)2 = 13. The direction

                                                -2
       satisfies the equation tan() = . Because the point (-3, -2) lies in the

                                                -3
       third quadrant, we know that  must be a third quadrant angle. Thus,
        = tan-1 2 + 180 = 213.69.

Checkpoint 9.27 Find the geometric form of the vector F = -6i + 8j.
Answer. magnitude 10, direction 127

Scalar Multiples of Vectors in Coordinate Form

Scalar multiplication is easy to compute in coordinate form. This is really a
consequence of the fact that the sides of similar triangles are proportional.

The figure at right shows the vectors u = 3i + 2j                    v

and v = 2u. The vector v is twice as long as

u and points in the same direction as u. You                 u

can see that each component of v is twice the

corresponding component of u, so that v =

6i + 4j.

          Scalar Multiplication in Coordinate Form.

If v = ai + bj and k is a scalar, then

                           kv = kai + kbj

    In other words, to find a scalar multiple of a vector in coordinate form, we
multiply each component by the scalar.

Example 9.28 The vector v has coordinate form v = 4i - 7j. Find the

                                                  1
coordinate form for the vector w = - v.

Solution. We multiply each component of v by - to get w = -2i + j.
                                                       2                2

Checkpoint 9.29 Find the coordinate form for the vector u = 3v, where
v = -12i + 15j.

Answer. u = -36i + 45j

    If we divide a non-zero vector v by its own length, we create a unit vector

that points in the same direction as v. (Dividing a vector by a scalar k is the
                                              1

same as multiplying the vector by .)
                                              k

Example 9.30 Find a unit vector pointing in the same direction as v = 2i - 4j.

Solution. We first compute the magnitude of v.

                                                       
              v = 22 + (-4)2 = 20 = 2 5

Next we multiply v by the reciprocal of its length. The unit vector in the same
direction as v is then

          1             1
          u = v =  (2i - 4j)
          v             25

                        1    1                         1 -2

    By computing its length, you can check that the vector u found in the
previous Example really is a unit vector.

          u=             12  -2 2                      14
                        +    =                           + = 11

Once we have a unit vector u that points in a given direction, we can create
a vector of any length in that direction, simply by scaling u by the length we
desire. For example, the vector of length 10 pointing in the same direction as v
in the previous example is

                                          1 -2
    10u = 10 ·  i +  j

A vector w of length k in the direction of v is given by w = v.

Answer. u = -  i +  j, w = - 10i + 3 10j

Adding Vectors in Coordinate Form

It is also easy to add vectors in coordinate form. The figure below shows the
sum of u = i + 2j and v = 5i + 3j. Remember that we add two vectors by
following the first vector by the second.

The vector sum describes the path                                               v u+v
                                                                                v u+v
             1 unit in the x-direction, then
                                                                             u

             2 units in the y-direction, then
             5 units in the x-direction, then

                3 units in the y-direction.

But we arrive at the same endpoint by traveling u

1 + 5 = 6 units in the x-direction, then
   2 + 3 = 5 units in the y-direction.

    The resultant vector has components that are just the sums of the compo-
nents of the vectors u and v. To add two vectors in coordinate form, we add
the corresponding components.

If u = ai + bj and v = ci + dj, then

    u + v = (a + c)i + (b + d)j

Example 9.32 Kyle flew 15 miles southwest and then 20 miles on a bearing
of 260. What is his current position relative to his starting point?

Solution. A sketch of Kyle's journey is shown below. We begin by converting
the vector for each leg of his journey into coordinate form.
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                               475

       vx = 15 cos(225) = -10.607                         225
       vy = 15 sin(225) = -10.607
       wx = 20 cos(190) = -19.696                    190  15 mi
       wy = 20 sin(190) = -3.473
                                   20 mi 260
Thus,

v = -10.607i - 10.607j and w = -19.696i - 3.473j

We find the resultant vector, r, by adding v and w.

r = (-10.607 - 19.696)i + (-10.607 - 3.473)j
  = -30.303i - 14.08j

Kyle's position vector is r = 30.303i - 14.08j, or about 30.3 miles west and 14.1
miles south of his starting position.

Checkpoint 9.33 Arianna's yacht heads 10 west of north at a speed of 20

land?
Answer. 22.7 kph due north

    The coordinate form is especially efficient if we want to add more than two
vectors.

Example 9.34 While exploring an abandoned cottage in the woods, you
discover an old map showing the location of a buried treasure.

    1 From the cottage, go 10 km in the direction 70.

    2 From that point, go 12.8 km in the direction 348.

    3 Finally, go 9.5 km in the direction 129.

    You wonder if the directions will lead you safely to the treasure. You draw
vectors to illustrate the path described by the directions, as shown in the figure.
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                           476

    Instead of following the map directions, you plan to fly by helicopter from
the abandoned cottage directly to the treasure, but you will need to know the
correct heading and distance to fly. Draw the vector for the net displacement
from the cottage to the treasure, and give its length and direction.
Solution. The helicopter's flight plan is the vector sum of the three vectors
u, v, and w shown in the figure. To find their sum, we resolve each of the three
vectors into its components. In coordinate form, the three displacement vectors
are

              u = (10 cos(70))i + (10 sin(70))j = 3.42i + 9.40j
              v = (12.8 cos(348))i + (12.8 sin(348))j = 12.52i - 2.66j
              w = (9.5 cos(129))i + (9.5 sin(129))j = -5.98i + 7.38j

The net displacement is given by the resultant vector, r. We add the corre-
sponding components ofu, v, and w.

         r = (3.42i + 9.40j) + (12.52i - 2.66j) + (-5.98i + 7.38j)
           = (3.42 + 12.52 - 5.98)i + (9.40 - 2.66 + 7.38)j = 10i + 14.12j

The treasure is at the point 10 km east
and 14.12 km north of the cottage. To
find the flight plan for the helicopter, we
compute the magnitude and direction of
the vector r.

r = 102 + 14.122 = 17.3

tan() =    14.12  = 1.412

           10

 = tan-1(1.412) = 54.69

Thus, the treasure is 17.3 km from the
cottage, in the direction 54.7 from east.
The helicopter's flight path is shown at
right.

Force

When you push or pull on something, you are exerting a force on the object.
For example, the weight of an object is actually a force, the result of gravity
pulling the object towards the earth. A force has magnitude (measured in
pounds) and direction, so force is a vector quantity. A force applied to an
object causes the object to accelerate in the direction of the force.

    When two or more forces act simultaneously on an object, the object moves
as if it were acted on by the sum of the individual force vectors. The sum of all
the forces acting on an object is called the resultant force.

Example 9.36

Abe and Bart are trying to move a refrigerator by              B
pulling on it with forces of 150 pounds and 120       120 80 150
pounds respectively, as shown in figure (a). What is
the resulting force on the refrigerator, and in what                          A
direction will it move?                                               20

Solution. We write each force in its coordinate form.

       A = (150 cos(20))i + (150 sin(20))j = 140.95i + 51.30j
       B = (120 cos(80))i + (120 sin(80))j = 20.84i + 118.18j

Next, we add the forces applied by Abe and Bart to find the resultant force,
r = A + B.

              r = (140.95i + 51.30j) + (20.84i + 118.18j)
                = 161.75i + 169.48j

The magnitude of the resultant force is                r

r = 161.752 + 169.482 = 234.28                             118.18j

and the direction of the force is given by                   20.84i
              tan-1 169.48 = 46.33                         51.3j
                        161.75
                                            140.95i

    The force exerted on the refrigerator is about 234 pounds, and it will move
at an angle of 46 from the horizontal segment shown in the figure.

Checkpoint 9.37 Two tugboats pull on a barge in the river with forces
u = 20i + 8j and v = 28i - 6j, measured in thousands of pounds. In what
direction will the barge move, and what is the magnitude of the force propelling
it?

Answer. 2.4, 48.04 thousand lbs

    If vectors u and v have the same magnitude but opposite directions, then
u + v has zero magnitude and is called the zero vector. A zero displacement
vector means that the object started and ended in the same place; a zero
velocity vector means that the object is not moving. We denote the zero vector
by 0, so 0 = 0.

    The vector that has the same magnitude as v but the opposite direction is
called the opposite of v and denoted by -v. Then

                    v + -v = 0

If the sum of the forces acting on an object is 0, the forces are said to be in
equilibrium, and the object will remain stationary.
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                            478

Example 9.38 Recall the refrigerator in the previous example. Carl does not
want Abe and Bart to move the refrigerator. How hard must Carl pull so that
the refrigerator remains motionless?

Solution. The force C that Carl applies must equal in magnitude the sum of
the forces applied by Abe and Bart, but point in the opposite direction. That
is,

                                     C = -r = -(A + B)

So Carl must pull with 234.3 pounds in the direction 180 + 46.33 = 226.33.

9.3 The Dot Product

Components

We have seen that it can be useful to resolve a vector into horizontal and
vertical components. We can also break a vector into components that point in
other directions.

    Imagine the following experiment: Delbert holds a ball at shoulder height
and then drops it, so that it falls to the ground. Francine holds a ball at
shoulder height on an inclined ramp, then releases it so that it rolls downhill.
Which ball will reach the ground first?

    Although gravity causes both balls to speed up, the free-falling ball will
reach the ground first. The force of gravity pulls straight down, the same
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                             484

direction as the motion of the free-falling ball, but the rolling ball must move
at an angle to the pull of gravity, along the surface of the ramp. Only part of
the gravitational force accelerates the rolling ball, and the rest of the force is
counteracted by the surface of the ramp. What fraction of the gravitational
force causes the ball to roll?

                        v                               v
                         uF                              uF



                    a.                                      b.

    In figure (a), the gravitational force F is resolved into the sum of two vectors,

F = u + v, where v points down the ramp, and u is perpendicular to the ramp.

The magnitude of v is called the component of F in the direction of motion,

and is denoted by compvF. This is the portion of the gravitational force that
moves the ball. From figure (b), we see that compvF = F cos(), where  is
the angle between F and v.

                   Component of a Vector.

The component of a vector F in the direction of vector v is

                               compvF = F cos()
where  is the angle between F and v.

    With a little geometry, you can verify that in this example the angle  is
the complement of the angle of inclination of the ramp, . (Think of similar
triangles.) Now suppose that we increase the angle of inclination. As  increases,
 decreases, cos() increases, and hence compvF increases. This result agrees
with our experience: as the ramp gets steeper, the ball rolls faster.

Example 9.40 Delbert uses a sheet of plywood as a ramp for his wheelbarrow.
The ramp is inclined at an angle of 15 to the horizontal. The plywood can
support a maximum weight of 200 pounds. What weight will the ramp support?

Solution. The component of the weight perpendicular to the ramp cannot be
more than 200 pounds. If the weight of the wheelbarrow is w, and v is a vector
perpendicular to the ramp, as shown below, then the angle between v and w is
15, by similar triangles. Thus, the component of w in the direction of w is

compvw = w cos(15) = 200

                 w (0.9659) = 200                       15            200 lbs
                                                                wv
                    w = 207.06
                                                                  ?
The ramp can support no more than about 207 pounds.                30 lb

Checkpoint 9.41

Delbert pushes a lawn mower whose handle makes a

40 angle with the horizontal. If he applies a force of

30 pounds in the direction of the handle, what is the

component of the force in the horizontal direction?     40

Answer. 23 pounds
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                         485

Coordinate Form for Components

In the examples above, we computed the component of a force F in the direction
of a vector v by knowing the angle between F and v. If the vectors are given
in coordinate form (that is, v = ai + bj), we may not know the angle between
them. Can we compute the component of a vector w in the direction of v, in
terms of the coordinates of v andw?

    Suppose v = ai + bj and w = ci + dj, as shown below. We will need to
compute the cosine of  in terms of a, b, c, and d.

First verify that                             b                       w
                        and sin() =                        d
                     a
      cos() =                                 v            b v
                                               d                 
                     v  and sin() =                                    ca
                     c                        w
      cos() =
                     w

Because  =  = , we use the subtraction formula for cosine.

                        cos() = cos() cos() + sin() sin()

                        =         ac    +         bd

                                  vw vw

                        =         1     (ac + bd)

                                  vw

And finally,

                                                         ac + bd
                        compvw = w cos() = v

Now we have a fromula for the component of a vector w in the direction of

a vector v.

              Component of a Vector in Coordinate Form.

    If v = ai + bj and w = ci + dj, then the component of w in the
direction of v is given by

                                        ac + bd
                        compvw = v

Caution 9.42 Recall that the "component" of a vector is a scalar. If a vector
w is resolved into two component vectors, w = u + v, its components are the
lengths of the vectors u and v. The vectors u and v themselves are called the
vector components of w.

Example 9.43

    a Compute the component of w = 6i + 2j in the direction of v = 4i + 3j.

b Find the vector component of w in the direction of v.

c Find the vector component of w perpendicular to v.

Solution.

a We use the formula derived above.

                                  ac + bd 4(6) + 3(2) 30
                        compvw =        =                  = =6
                                     v            42 + 32         5

Remember that the component of w in the direction of v is a scalar; it is
the length of the projection of w onto v.

q = (4i + 3j) = i + j

c Because w = p + q, where p is perpendicular to q, we have

                           24 18                68
p = w - q = (6i + 2j) - i + j = i - j

compvw, is quite useful and is given a name; it is called the dot product of
the vectors v = ai + bj and w = ci + dj.

    It is easy to remember the formula for the dot product if we think of adding
the product of the i-components and the product of the j-components of the
two vectors.

                                         Dot Product.
         The dot product of two vectors v = v1i + v2j and w = w1i + w2j
    is the scalar

                                    v · w = v1w1 + v2w2

Note 9.45 From the formula above, you can see that the dot product is
commutative. That is,

                                           v·w=w·v
You can check that this is true in the following example.
Example 9.46 Compute the dot product of v = 5i - 3j and w = 4i + j.
Solution. We apply the formula above to find

                                 v · w = 5(4) + (-3)(1) = 17

    In the examples above, you can see that the dot product of two vectors is a
scalar. For this reason, the dot product is also called the scalar product.
Checkpoint 9.47 Compute the dot product of v = 6i + 2j and w = -2i + 3j.
Answer. -6

    We can now write the formula for compvw using the dot product.

                                                         ac + bd v · w
                        compvw = w cos() = v = v

We have derived an alternate formula for a component of a vector.

                        Component of a Vector.
The component of w in the direction of v is the scalar

                                              v·w
                              compvw = v

Example 9.48 Compute the component of v = 5i - 3j in the direction of
w = 4i + j.

                                                                                  v·w
Solution. Using the formula above, we have compwv = w . We first
compute v · w and w .

                                                                                    
             v · w = 5(4) + (-3)(1) = 17 and w = 42 + 12 = 17

Thus,                                               
                         v · w 17                     17 w

          compwv = w = 17 = 17
The length of the projection of v in the direction
of w is 17 units, as shown at right.

                                                                                        v

Geometric Meaning of the Dot Product

An even more important relationship, which gives geometric meaning to the
dot product, follows from the formula for a component. We now have two ways
to compute the component of w in the direction of v:

                                                                              v·w
                  compvw = w cos  and compvw = v
Equating these two expressions, we find

                                                         v·w
                                        w cos() =

                                                           v
or v w cos  = v · w. This is a geometric formula for the dot product.

                       Geometric Form for the Dot Product.
         The dot product of two vectors v and w is the scalar

                                   v · w = v w cos()

    where  is the angle between the vectors.

    The dot product is a way of multiplying two vectors that depends on the
angle between them.
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                           488

· If  = 0, so that v and w point in the same direction, then cos() = 1
   and v · w is just the product of their lengths, v w .

· If v and w are perpendicular, then cos() = 0, so v · w = 0. (Two vectors
   v and w are said to be orthogonal if their dot product is zero.)

· If  is between 0 and 90, the dot product multiplies the length of v
   times the component of w in the direction of v.

                    w                         w

            w                   v                               v
                v   v·w=0                     v · w = v compvw

v·w= v w

Example 9.50 Show that the vectors v = 2i + 6j and w = -9i + 3j are
orthogonal.

Solution. We compute the dot product of the vectors.

                    v · w = 2(-9) + 6(3) = 0

Thus, v w cos() = 0, so v and w are orthogonal. Because neither v = 0
or w = 0, it must be the case that cos() = 0, so  = 90 or 270.

    b Find a vector w perpendicular to v = -3i - 5j.

Answer.

Using the dot product, we can find the angle between two vectors.

                    Angle Between Two Vectors.
The angle  between two vectors v and w is given by

                                             v·w
                             cos() =

                                             vw

Example 9.52 Find the angle between the vectors u = -3i+2j and v = 5i+3j.
Solution. We first compute u · v and the magnitude of each vector.

u · v = -3(5) + 2(3) = -9                                                 v
                                              u

  u = (-3)2 + 22 = 13                                    
                          

  v = 52 + 32 = 34

Then we apply the formula for cos().

                    v·w                   -9
cos() =                  =   = -0.4281
                    vw           13 34

 = cos-1(-0.4281) = 115.35

The angle between the vectors is 115.35.

9.4 Chapter Summary and Review

Key Concepts

    1 A quantity defined by both a magnitude (such as a distance) and a
       direction is called a vector.
CHAPTER 9. VECTORS                                                    494

2 Two vectors are equal if they have the same length and direction; it does
   not matter where the vector starts.

3 The length of a vector v is called its magnitude, and is denoted by v .

4 The sum of two vectors u and v is a new vector, w, starting at the tail
   of the first vector and ending at the head of the second vector. The sum
   is called the resultant vector.

5 Addition of vectors is commutative. The rule for adding vectors is
   sometimes called the parallelogram rule.

                                 Operations on Vectors.

    6 1 We can multiply a vector, v, by a scalar, k.

                  a If k > 0, the magnitude of kv is k times the magnitude
                      of v. The direction of kv is the same as the direction
                      of v.

                  b If k < 0, the direction of kv is opposite the direction of
                     v.

            2 We can add two vectors v andw with the parallelogram rule.

7 Any vector can be written as the sum of its horizontal and vertical vector
   components, vx and vy.

8 The components of a vector v whose direction is given by the angle 
   in standard position are the scalar quantities

                    vx = v cos()

                    vy = v sin()

9 The magnitude and direction of a vector with components and are given

   by
                       v = (vx)2 + (vy)2 and tan() = vy
                                                                            vx

10 To add two vectors using components, we can resolve each vector into its
    horizontal and vertical components, add the corresponding components,
    then compute the magnitude and direction of the resultant.

11 A vector of magnitude 1 is called a unit vector. The unit vector in the
    direction of the x-axis is denoted by i. The unit vector in the direction of
    the y-axis is called j.

    is the vector whose horizontal component is a and whose vertical
    component is b.

    The picture on the left below is a photo of a fern leaf. The picture on the
right is a computer-generated image called the Barnsley fern. It is named after
the British mathematician Michael Barnsley, who developed it in the 1980's.

    The Barnsley fern is an example of a fractal. A fractal is an infinitely
complex pattern created by iteration: repeating a process over and over in an
ongoing feedback loop. You can watch a Barnsley fern being created at

               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGMGVpLMtMs
    One of the most famous and intriguing fractals is the Mandelbrot set, named
after the French mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot, who lived from 1924 to
2010. The Mandelbrot set looks like a cardioid, or heart-shaped figure, studded
with circles all around its boundary.

                                                 499
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 500

Like the Barnsley fern, we can create the Mandelbrot set by repeatedly

evaluating a simple equation over and over. This equation uses complex

numbers.

The plane of complex numbers is similar to a two dimensional coordinate

system. Every point on the plane is represented by a complex number c = x+iy,

and we perform the following steps for every point:

Starting with z1 = 0, we create an infinite sequence of complex numbers zn

according to the rule

                       zn+1 = (zn)2 + c

If this sequence increases to infinity (it diverges), we color the point c white. If
the sequence does not increase beyond a certain limit (it is bounded), we color
the point black.

    We create a sequence for every point c in the plane. The collection of all
the black points is the Mandelbrot set. It sits in the portion of the plane where
x is between -1 and 2, and y is between -1.5 and 1.5. Outside the set, all the
values of c cause the sequence to go to infinity, and the color of the point is
proportional to the speed at which the sequence diverges.

    Because the calculations must be performed thousands or millions of times,
we need computers to study them. The higher the number of iterations, the
better the quality of the image produced. Not coincidentally, the Mandelbrot
set was discovered in 1980, shortly after the invention of the personal computer.

    One of the intriguing features of fractal images is self-similarity. If we
zoom in on a fractal, we see the same pattern repeated again and again,
sometimes with interesting variations. Here is a portion of the boundary of the
Mandelbrot set, blown up to many times its original size. You can see the copy
of whole set embedded in the image.

                          https://mathigon.org/world/Fractals

    Here are some more fractals, called Julia sets:

    Fractal patterns seem familiar because the laws that govern the creation
of fractals are found throughout the natural world. Tree branches, rivers, ice
crystals, and seashells all form in fractal shapes. You can see some examples at

10.1 Polar Coordinates

The Cartesian coordinate system is also called the rectangular coordinate
system, because it describes a location in the plane as the vertex of a rectangle.
To construct a rectangular coordinate system, we begin with two perpendicular
axes that intersect at the origin. The x- and y-coordinates of a point indicate
the length and width of a rectangle with one vertex at the origin. The point
P (x, y) sits at the opposite vertex of the rectangle, as shown in the figure below.

    In Chapter 9 we used vectors to specify a location by giving a distance
and a direction. For example, we might say that the airport is located 5 miles
southwest of the city center. This method of designating locations is so useful
that we will construct a new coordinate system using the same tools: distance
and direction.

                  P (x, y)                   P (r, )

Cartesian coordinates       Polar coordinates

    In the polar coordinate system we start with the origin or pole, and a
single ray from the pole, called the polar axis. We describe the location of a
point P in the plane by measuring the distance, |r|, from P to the pole, and

the angle, , that OP makes with the polar axis (measured counterclockwise).
The components of the ordered pair (r, ) are called the polar coordinates of
the point P .

                             Polar Coordinates.
The polar coordinates of a point P in the plane are (r, ), where
· |r| is the distance from P to the pole,
·  is the angle measured counterclockwise from the polar axis to
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 502

the ray through P from the pole.

In our work with polar coordinates, we will always              P  (2,      )
use radians for the angle . For example, the point                       2

                                                       2

angle of radians, and Q(3, 4) is located 3 units
            2

from the pole at an angle of 4 radians. The graphs
of P and Q are shown at right.

    A piece of graph paper in rectangular coordinates consists of a grid of
horizontal and vertical lines. These are the lines x = k and y = k, for evenly
spaced values of k. Each vertical grid line consists of points that have the same
x-coordinate, and each horizontal grid line is made up of points that have the
same y-coordinate. The grid lines are bench marks to help us locate points
with specific rectangular coordinates.

    A piece of graph paper in polar coordinates consists of a grid of concentric
circles and radial lines, as shown below. Each circle consists of points with the
same r-coordinate; they are all the same distance from the pole. All points
with the same -coordinate lie on one of the radial lines. This grid helps us
locate points with specific polar coordinates.

Plotting Points

You are used to thinking in rectangular coordinates: to locate a point, we move
so many units left or right, and so many units up or down. When working in
polar coordinates, we want to "think radially:" how far to move from the pole,
and in which direction.

Each point has infinitely many polar coordinates, because we can add

multiples of 2 to the value of . For example, the point with polar coordinates

                                         5  and 1,    -3             .

If we allow negative values of r, there are even more ways to write the

coordinates of a point. Each angle designates a line through the pole, and each

line has both a postive and a negative direction.

                                                                                  4

Regions in the Plane

In Cartesian coordinates, we use equations and inequalities to describe regions
in the plane. For example, the shaded region in figure (a) is the graph of
y  x + 2. The pair of inequalities x  -2, 1 < y < 3 describes the region in
figure (b). This region is particularly simple, in that its boundaries are portions
of the coordinate grid lines x = k and y = k, where k is a constant.

                   y                                y
                            y = x+2  x = -2

                                                           y=3

                              x                            y=1
                                                           x

                   a.                         b.

    In the polar plane, the coordinate grid lines are circles centered at the pole,
with equations r = k, and lines through the pole, with equations  = k.

Example 10.6 Sketch the region designated by each set of inequalities.

a 1r<3

Solution.

Converting Between Polar and Cartesian Coordinates

Using trigonometry, it is easy to convert from polar coordinates to Cartesian, or
vice versa. The figure below shows how the two sets of coordinates are related.

    If we know the polar coordinates (r, ), we can compute the Cartesian
coordinates (x, y) as the legs of a right triangle.

Equations in Polar Coordinates

Polar coordinates are useful for studying objects or phenomena that have radial
symmetry, such as circles, spheres, and cylinders, or the central forces (those
that act equally in all directions), such as gravity and electric charge. The
equations describing these objects are often simpler in polar coordinates than
they are in Cartesian coordinates.

    It is not hard to convert an equation from Cartesian to polar coordinates:
we replace each x with r cos() and each y with r sin().

Example 10.13 Convert the equation 2x + 3y = 6 to polar coordinates.

Solution. Replacing by x by r cos() and y by r sin(), we get

2r cos() + 3r sin() = 6

If we solve for r in terms of , we find

r(2 cos() + 3 sin()) = 6
                6

r=
     2 cos() + 3 sin()

Neither of these equations is simpler than the Cartesian version, but that should
not surprise us, because the original equation describes a line, and Cartesian
coordinates are better suited to rectilinear graphs.

Checkpoint 10.14 Convert the equation x2 + y2 = 4 to polar coordinates.
Answer. r = 2

    Perhaps you recognize the equation in the previous exercise as a circle. Note
also that its polar equation has a simpler form than the familiar Cartesian
version.

    Converting equations from polar to Cartesian form is not as straightforward
as the other direction (and is sometimes impossible). Here are some strategies
to try:

   · Expressions of the form r cos() or r sin() can be replaced by x and y,
       respectively.

   · r2 can be replaced by x2 + y2.
                                           y

   · tan() can be replaced by .
                                           x

Example 10.15 Convert the equation r = 3 cos() to Cartesian coordinates.
Solution. We multiply both sides of the equation by r to obtain

                                          r2 = 3r cos()

Now we can replace the left side by x2 + y2 and the right side by 3x to obtain

                                           x2 + y2 = 3x

This is the equation of a circle. By completing the square in each variable, we
can write the equation in standard form,

   x - 3 + y2 2 = 9
   2                                     4

3                                           3
The center of the circle is , 0 , and its radius is .

Answer. y2 =  x4

              1-x  2

Review the following skills you will need for this section.

Algebra Refresher 10.1

Recall the standard form for the equation of a circle of radius r centered at

(h, k):

                        (x - h)2 + (y - k)2 = r2

Use completing the square to write each equation in standard form.

1 x2 + y2 - 4x + 2y - 4 = 0

2 x2 + y2 = 88 + 18y

3 x2 + y2 + 25 = 9 - 10x - 9y

4 5y2 = 85 - 5x2 - 10x

Algebra Refresher Answers
    1 (x - 2)2 + (y + 1)2 = 32
    2 x2 + (y - 9)2 = 132
    3 (x - 5)2 + (y - 3)2 = (32)2

Concepts

                        Polar Coordinates.

             The polar coordinates of a point P in the plane are (r, ),
         where

         1 · |r| is the distance from P to the pole,             P

          ·  is the angle measured counterclock-             r   y
             wise from the polar axis to the ray
             through P from the pole.                        
                                                              x

                          Non-Uniqueness of Polar Coordinates.

         2 1 Any point with polar coordinates (r, ) also has coordinates
                   (r,  + 2k), where k is an integer.

                2 The point (r, ) can also be designated by (-r,  + ).
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 509

                3 The pole has coordinates (0, ), for any value of .

    3 In the polar plane, the coordinate grid lines are circles centered at the
       pole, with equations r = k, and lines through the pole, with equations
        = k.
                                      Conversion Equations.

         4 1 To convert from polar coordinates (r, ) to Cartesian:

                                                   x = r cos()
                                                   y = r sin()

                2 To convert from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar:

                                                 r = x2 + y2
                                                               y

                                                  tan() =
                                                               x

                where the choice of  depends on the quadrant.

    5 To convert an equation from Cartesian to polar coordinates, we replace
       each x with r cos() and each with y with r sin(). To convert an equation
       from polar to Cartesian coordinates, look for expressions of the form
       r cos(), r sin(), r2, or tan().

10.2 Polar Graphs

Graphing in Polar Coordinates

When we plot points in Cartesian coordinates, we start at the origin and move
a distance right or left given by the x-coordinate of the point, then move up or
down according to the y-coordinate. When we sketch the graph of an equation
or function, we think of drawing the graph from left to right, with the "height"
of the graph at each x-value given by the function, as shown in figure (a).

                     a.                            b.

    In polar coordinates, however, the dependent variable, r, gives not a height
but a distance from the pole in direction , as shown in figure (b). When
graphing an equation in polar coordinates, we think of sweeping around the
pole in the counterclockwise direction, and at each angle  the r-value tells us
how far the graph is from the pole.

Example 10.17 Graph the polar equation r = 2 sin().

Solution. We make a table of values, choosing the special values for . For
each value of , we evaluate r = 2 sin().

0                        2 3 5                                   

                     6 4 3 2 3 4 6
r0 1 2 3 2 3 2 1 0

    First we'll plot the points in the first quadrant. Observe that as  increases
              

from 0 to , r increases from 0 to 2. Starting at the pole, we connect the
              2

points in order of increasing . Imagine a radial line sweeping around the graph
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 513

through the first quadrant: as the angle increases, the length of the segment
increases, so that its tip traces out the graph shown in figure (a).

                 1.5                                  1.5

                 0.5                                  0.5

                 a.                                   b.

                                                                                              
    Now continue plotting the points in the table as  increases from to .

                                                                                              2
In the second quadrant, r decreases as  increases, as shown in figure (b). The

graph we obtain is, in fact, a circle, which we will prove algebraically shortly.

However, we have not yet plotted points for  between 0 and 2. Because sin()

is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, all the r-values for these angles

are negative.

                 7 5 4 3 5 7 11                                  

                 6    4      3 2  3         4              6

               r 0 -1 - 2 - 3 -2 - 3 - 2 -1 0

   When we plot the points in this table, we see that the original graph is

                                                          7
traced out again. For example, the point , -1 is the same as the point

                                                           6

                 5                                            
   , 1 , the point , - 2 is the same as the point , 2 , and so on,
6                4                                            4

around the circle. Thus, the graph of r = 2 sin  is a circle, traced twice for

0    2.

   To prove that the graph in the precious Example is really a circle, we convert

the equation r = 2 sin() to Cartesian form. First, multiply both sides by r to

obtain

                             r2 = 2r sin()

Next, replace r2 by x2 + y2 and r sin() by y, to get

                             x2 + y2 = 2y

This equation is quadratic in two variables, so its graph is a conic section. We
put the equation in standard form by completing the square in y.

           x2 + y2 - 2y = 0  Add 1 to both sides.
   x2 + (y2 - 2y +1) = 1     Write the equation in standard form.
   (x - 0)2 + (y - 1)2 = 1

We have the equation of a circle with center (0, 1) and radius 1.

Using a Graphing Calculator

You are familiar with the graphs of many equations in Cartesian coordinates,
including lines, parabolas and other conic sections, and the graphs of basic
functions. You should now become familiar with some standard graphs in
polar coordinates. These include circles and roses, cardioids and limaçons,
lemniscates, and spirals.

    At the end of this section you will find a Catalog of the basic polar graphs
and their properties. You can use your calculator, set in Polar mode, to
experiment with these graphs.

Example 10.19 Graph the Archimedean spiral r = 2, for 0    6.

Solution. After setting the calculator in Polar mode, we enter the equation
r = 2 and enter the window settings

                                         40

                                         30

min = 0          max = 6 step = 0.1      20

Xmin = -25 Xmax = 25 Xstep = 5           10

Ymin = -25 Ymax = 25 Yscl = 5

We then press Zoom 5 to set a square
window. The graph is shown at right.

Studying a table of values can help us understand the shape of the graph.

                             0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25
                            r 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50

    As  increases, r increases also, at a constant rate. We wind our way around
the pole, steadily increasing our distance from the pole as we go. We spiral
outwards, tracing the graph shown above.

It is important to connect the points on the graph in order of increasing .

Example 10.21 Graph the polar equation r = 2 sin(3).

Solution. We'll graph the equation in stages in order to see how the graph is
traced out. Begin with the window settings

    min = 0                              step = 0.5
                          max =
    Xmin = -4.5                          Xstep = 1
    Ymin = -3                         3      Yscl = 1
                        Xmax = 4.5

                        Ymax = 3

Watch as your calculator produces the graph shown in figure (a).

    Observe that, as  increases from 0 to , r first increases, reaching its

                                    3
maximum value of 2 at  = and then decreases back to 0. You can verify the

                                    6

                                                                                         18
points create the first loop of the graph.

out two loops, as shown in figure (b). For  between and , r is negative,
                                                  3           3
so the second loop lies in the third and fourth quadrants.

Sketching Familiar Equations

You should also be able to sketch the standard polar graphs by hand. Once you
recognize an equation as a particular type of graph, say a rose or a limaçon,
you can sketch the graph quickly by finding just a few well-chosen guidepoints.
The next example demonstrates a technique for sketching a rose.

Example 10.23 Graph the polar equation r = 3 sin(2).

Solution. Referring to the Catalog of Polar Graphs, we see that the graph
of this equation is a rose, with petal length a = 3 and four petals, because
2n = 4. If we can locate the tips of the petals, we can use them as guidepoints
to sketch the graph.

    Now, the points at the tips of the petals have r = 3, so we substitute r = 3
into the equation of the rose to find the values of  at those points.

3 = 3 sin(2)              Divide both sides by 3.

1 = sin(2)                Apply the arcsine function to both sides.
                          Divide both sides by 2.

   = 2

    Thus, one of the petal tips is located at  = . Because the 4 petals are

                                                                 4
                                                                                     2 

evenly spaced around the pole, the angle between the petals is = , and
                                                                                      42

    The limaçons, r = a ± sin() and r = a ± cos(), are another family of

Solution.

This is the equation for a limaçon, with a = 3      r = 3 + 2 cos()

           a.                                          b.

Solution.

a The graph is a circle centered at (-2, 0) and with radius 2, so we choose
   the equation r = 2a cos(), with a = -2. Thus, r = -4 cos().

b The graph is a cardioid with its axis of symmetry on the x-axis, and the
  "bottom" of the heart points in the positivexdirection, so its equation has
   the form r = a + a cos(). At  = 0, r = 2, so we can solve for a:

                                    2 = a + a cos(0)
                                    2 = a + a(1) = 2a

Thus, a = 1 and we choose the equation r = 1 + cos().

Finding Intersection Points

To find the intersection points of two graphs, we solve the system made up of
their equations. If the equations are y = f (x) and y = g(x), we simply solve the
equation f (x) = g(x). For example, we find the intersection points of y = x2
and y = x + 2 by solving the equation x2 - x - 2 = 0 to get

                                             x2 - x - 2 = 0
                                        (x - 2)(x + 1) = 0
                                   x - 2 = 0, x + 1 = 0

                                           x = 2, x = -1
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 519

These are the x-coordinates of the intersection                      y

points, and we can find the y-coordinates by 8
substituting these values into either equation.

                                                                  6

· For x = 2, we find y = 22 = 4.                                  4

· For x = -1, we find y = (-1)2 = 1.                              2

Thus, the intersection points are (2, 4) and            -4 -2                    x
(-1, 1), as shown at right.                                    -2       24

    To find the intersection points of the polar graphs r = f () and r = g()
we solve the equation f () = g().

Example 10.29 Find all intersection points of the graphs of r = 2 + 2 sin()
and r = 2 + 2 cos().

Solution. We equate the two expressions for r and solve for .

r = 2 + 2 sin() = r = 2 + 2 cos()                 Divide both sides by cos().
            sin() = cos()                         Solve for .
            tan() = 1
                         5
                  = ,
                        44

    We evaluate either expression for t to find the other coordinate of the
intersection point.

                                                        1               
 when   = ,                     r = 2 + 2 sin     =2+  =2+ 2

              4
            5                                  5        -1                 
       = ,                                        =2+  =2- 2
             4                                 4           2

Thus, two of the intersection points are                                4

                                 5                                      3

at right. However, you can see in the figure that

the graphs also appear to intersect at the pole. To

verify that the pole indeed lies on both graphs, we

can solve for  in each equation when r = 0.

Caution 10.30 As we saw in the previous Example, solving a system of
equations r = f () and r = g() will not always reveal an intersection at
the pole, because r may be equal to zero for different values of  in the two
equations. We should always check separately whether the pole is a point on
both graphs.

Concepts

    1 When graphing an equation in polar coordinates, we think of sweeping
       around the pole in the counterclockwise direction, and at each angle 
       the r-value tells us how far the graph is from the pole.

    2 Standard graphs in polar coordinates include circles and roses, cardioids
       and limaçons, lemniscates, and spirals.

    3 To find the intersection points of the polar graphs r = f () and r = g()
       we solve the equation f () = g(). In addition, we should always check
       whether the pole is a point on both graphs.

Study Questions
    1 Delbert says that the graph of r = 2 sin() in the first example cannot
       be correct, because there are no points on the graph for angles between
       and 2. How do you respond?

    2 Is it possible to have a rose with only two petals? What would its equation
       be?

    3 Francine says that a circle of the form r = 2a cos() is just a special case
       of a limaçon. Support or refute her statement.

    4 There are no points on the graph of r2 = 4 cos(2) for angles between 
                                                                                                    4

10.3 Complex Numbers

So far most of your work in mathematics has been done using the set of real
numbers. We often represent the real numbers by a number line, because they
can be matched up one-for-one with the points on the line. Every real number is
either rational or irrational, and can be expressed as a decimal number, although
irrational numbers are non-repeating, non-terminating decimals. However, the
real numbers are actually a subset of a larger set of numbers called the complex
numbers.
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 529

You may have first encountered complex numbers as             y y = x2 - 2x + 2
                                                            8
solutions of certain quadratic equations. For example,      6
                                                            4
the graph of

              f (x) = x2 - 2x + 2

has no x-intercepts (as shown at right), because the        2

equation x2 - 2x + 2 - 0 has no real-valued solutions.

                                                        -2                  x
                                                               24

Applying the quadratic formula, we find

                    -(-2) ±  (-2)2 - 4(1)(2) 2 ± -4
              x=                                =
                                   2                    2

                                                   
                                   2 + -4       2 - -4
The solutions of the equation are          and              , but they are not
real numbers. Because -4 is not a real number, the equation x 2 2 2 - 2x + 2 - 0

has no real solutions.

Imaginary Numbers

                                                                    
Although square roots of negative numbers such as -4 are not real numbers,
they occur often in mathematics and its applications. Mathematicians began
working with square roots of negative numbers in the sixteenth century, in
their attempts to solve quadratic and cubic equations. René Descartes gave
them the name imaginary numbers, which reflected the mistrust with which
mathematicians regarded them at the time. Today, however, such numbers are
well understood and used routinely by scientists and engineers.

    We begin by defining a new number, called i, whose square is -1.

                                       Imaginary Unit.

         We define the imaginary unit, i, by
                               i2 = -1 or i = -1

    The letter i used in this way is not a variable, it is the name of a specific
number, and hence is a constant. The square root of any negative number can
be written as the product of a real number and i. For example,

                                      
                          -4 = -1 · 4
                                      
                             = -1 4 = i · 2

   
or -4 = 2i. Any number that is the product of i and a real number is called
an imaginary number.

                        Imaginary Numbers.

For any real number a > 0,

                                              
                          -a = -1 a = i a

                                           7                
Examples of imaginary numbers are 3i, i, - 38i, and i 5.
                                           8
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 530

Example 10.32 Write each radical as an imaginary number.

                                               
a -25                                      b 2 -3

Solution.

                    
a -25 = -1 25 = i 25 = 5i

                    
b 2 -3 = -1 3 = 2i 3

Checkpoint 10.33 Write each radical as an imaginary number.

                                                  
a -18                                      b -6 -5

Answer.

                                                   
a 3i 2                                     b -6i 5

Just as each positive number has two real-valued square roots, every negative

number has two imaginary square roots. For example, the two square roots of

-9 are 3i and -3i.

Complex Numbers

Consider the quadratic equation
                                         x2 - 2x + 5 = 0

Using the quadratic formula to solve the equation, we find

                 -(-2) ±  (-2)2 - 4(1)(5) 2 ± -16
           x=                                             =
                          2                                  2

                        
If we now replace -16 by 4i, we have

                    x=    2 ± 4i           = 1 ± 2i

                                     2

The two solutions are 1 + 2i and 1 - 2i. These are examples of complex
numbers.

                    Complex Numbers.

A complex number can be written in the form

                          z = a + bi

where a and b are real numbers.

Examples of complex numbers are

                           4-i
                    3 - 5i, 2 + 7i,        , 6i, and - 9
                                        3

In a complex number a + bi, a is called the real part, and b is called the
imaginary part. All real numbers are also complex numbers (with imaginary
part equal to zero). A complex number whose real part equals 0 is called a
pure imaginary number.

    The real and imaginary parts of a complex number cannot be combined.
Thus, two complex numbers z1 and z2 are equal if and only if their real parts
are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.

Equality of Complex Numbers.

    Two complex numbers z1 = a + bi and z2 = c + di are equal if and
only if

                                   a = c and c = d

                                                                             
Example 10.34 The solutions of the equation x2 - 2x + 2 = 0 are 2 ± -4 .
                                                                             2
Write these solutions as complex numbers, and simplify.

Arithmetic of Complex Numbers

We add and subtract complex numbers by combining their real and imaginary
parts separately. For example,

                          (4 + 5i) + (2 - 3i) = (4 + 2) + (5 - 3)i
                                                   = 6 + 2i

The algebraic form of this rule can be stated as follows.
                   Sum and Difference of Complex Numbers.

         The sum of two complex numbers z1 = a + bi and z2 = c + di is
              z1 + z2 = (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i

    Their difference is
              z1 - z2 = (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i

Example 10.36 Subtract: (8 - 6i) - (5 + 2i).
Solution. Combine the real and imaginary parts.

                        (8 - 6i) - (5 + 2i) = (8 - 5) + (-6 - 2)i
                                                 = 3 + (-8)i = 3 - 8i

Checkpoint 10.37 Subtract: (-3 + 2i) - (-3 - 2i)
Answer. 4i
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 532

Products of Complex Numbers

To find the product of two imaginary numbers, we use the fact that i2 = -1.
For example,

                                   (3i)(4i) = 3 · 4i2
                                              = 12(-1) = -12

    To find the product of two complex numbers, we use the distributive law,
as if the numbers were binomials.
Example 10.38 Multiply (2 + 3i)(3 - 5i).
Solution. We multiply each term of the first complex number by each term
of the second one.

                           (2 + 3i)(3 - 5i) = 6 - 10i + 9i - 15i2

Because i2 = -1, the last term, -15i2, can be replaced by -15(-1), or 15, to
obtain

                                        6 - 10i + 9i + 15
Finally, we combine the real parts and imaginary parts to obtain

                               (6 + 15) + (-10i + 9i) = 21 - i

Checkpoint 10.39 Multiply (-3 + 2i)(-3 - 2i).
Answer. 13

    In the Homework Probems, you will verify that the following rule holds.

                            Product of Complex Numbers.
         The product of two complex numbers z1 = a + bi and z2 = c + di is

               z1z2 = (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

Caution 10.40 One property of real numbers that is not true of complex
numbers is ab = a b. This identity fails when a and b are both negative.

For example, if a = b = -2, we have

                                     

      ab = (-2)(-2) = 4 = 2

but
                           
                             a · b = (-2) · (-2)

      = (-1 · 2) · (-1 · 2)
      = i2 · i2 = i2(2)2 = -2

  
so ab = a b. We can avoid possible errors by writing square roots of

negative numbers as imaginary numbers before attempting any calculations.

Quotients of Complex Numbers

To find the quotient of two complex numbers, we use the technique of rational-
izing the denominator. First consider division by a pure imaginary number.
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 533

Example 10.41 Divide         3 + 4i  .

                                2i                           

Solution. Because i is really a radical (remember that i = -1), we multiply

the numerator and denominator of the quotient by i to obtain

         (3 + 4i) · i 3i + 4i2             Apply the distributive law.
            2i · i = 2i2                   Recall that i2 = -1.
                           3i - 4
                       =
                             -2

To write the quotient in the form a + bi, we divide -2 into each term of the

numerator.                      3i 4 -3
                                    - = i+2

                                -2 -2 2

                          3
The quotient is 2 - i.

                          2

Checkpoint 10.42 Divide         8 + 9i  .

                                    3i

                    8
Answer. 3 - i

                    3

Perhaps you recall that to rationalize a binomial denominator, we multiply

                                                                        5
by its conjugate. For example, to rationalize the denominator of  , we
                                                               2+ 3
                                                    
multiply numerator and denominator by 2 - 3. A similar technique works

for dividing complex numbers. We first define the conjugate of a complex

number.

Definition 10.43 Complex Conjugate. For any complex number z = a+bi,
the number

                                           z¯ = a - bi

is called the complex conjugate of z.                                      

Note 10.44 The conjugate of a complex number has several useful properties.
In particular, the product of a nonzero complex number and its conjugate is
always a positive real number.

         zz¯ = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a2 - b2i2 = a2 - b2(-1) = a2 + b2

To illustrate, we calculate the quotient       5      . We multiply numerator and

                                           2 + 3i
denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, 2 - 3i, to obtain

                                        5 2 - 3i
                                             ·

                                     2 + 3i 2 - 3i

The denominator is then a real number, because

            (2 + 3i)(2 - 3i) = 4 - 6i + 6i - 9i2 = 4 + 9 = 13

and the quotient is

                       5 2 - 3i 10 - 15i 10 15
                             ·          =           = -i
                       2 + 3i 2 - 3i       13         13 13

Example 10.45 Divide         2 + 3i  .

                             4 - 2i

Solution. We multiply numerator and denominator by 4 + 2i, the complex

conjugate of the denominator.             Expand numerator
                                             and denominator.
         2 + 3i (2 + 3i)(4 + 2i)
                  =                      Replace i2 by -1.

         4 - 2i (4 - 2i)(4 + 2i)         Combine like terms.
                     8 + 4i + 12i + 6i2
                                          Divide 20 into each term
                  = 16 + 8i - 8i - 4i2        of numerator.
                     8 + 16i - 6

                  =
                      16 - (-4)

In the Homework Problems you will verify the rule for dividing complex

numbers.

                Quotient of Complex Numbers.

The quotient of two complex numbers z1 = a + bi and z2 = c + di is

          z1 a + bi a + bi c - di ac + bd bc - ad
          z2 = c + di = c + di · c - di = c2 + d2 + c2 + d2 i

Graphing Complex Numbers

Real numbers can be plotted on a number line, but to graph a complex number
we use a plane, called the complex plane. In the complex plane, the real
numbers lie on the horizontal or real axis, and pure imaginary numbers lie
on the vertical or imaginary axis. To plot a complex number a + bi we move
a units from the origin in the horizontal direction and b units in the vertical
direction.

Example 10.47 Plot the numbers z = 2 + 3i and z¯ = 2 - 3i in the complex
plane.

Solution.

To plot z = 2 + 3i, we move from the origin               4i          2 + 3i
2 units to the right and 3 units up. To plot              2i          24
z¯ = 2 - 3i we move from the origin 2 units to
the right and 3 units down. The numbers 2 + 3i   -4 -2
and 2 - 3i are plotted in the figure at right.          -2i

                                                 -4i 2 - 3i

         -5i
-3 - 5i

Caution 10.49 You are used to plotting ordered pairs (x, y) in the Cartesian
plane, so that one point represents two real numbers, given by its coordinates.
However, in the complex plane one point represents a single complex number
z = a + bi, and the coordinates of the point are the real and imaginary parts
of z. For example, the point (2, -6) in the real plane represents the pair of
real numbers x = 2 and y = -6, but the point (2, -6) in the complex plane
represents the complex number z = 2 - 6i.

    The modulus, or length, of a complex number is its distance from the
origin in the complex plane. The modulus of a complex number is analogous to
the absolute value of a real number, and is denoted by |z|. If z = a + bi, we
can use the Pythagorean theorem to compute its modulus.

                           Modulus of a Complex Number.

         The modulus of a complex number z = a + bi is given by

                                        |z| = a2 + b2

For example, the modulus of z = 2 + 3i is
                                                        

                                |z| = 22 + 32 = 13

Example 10.50 Plot all points in the complex plane that satisfy the equation
|z| = 4.
Solution.

                                                                                               5i

The points that satisfy |z| = 4 all lie at a dis-

tance of 4 units from the origin. In other words,

they lie on a circle of radius 4 centered at the          -5       5

origin, as shown at right.

                                                              -5i

Checkpoint 10.51 Write an equation for the circle of radius 1 centered at the
origin in the complex plane.

Answer. |z| = 1

    We can think of the graph of a complex number z = a + bi as the vector
(or arrow) that starts at the origin and ends at the point (a, b) in the complex
plane, as shown in figure (a).
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 536

iy                                          iy

                z = a + bi                      z2         z1 + z2
                                                        z1

            a.                                      b.

    Then the sum of two complex numbers corresponds to the sum of the
two vectors representing them. Figure (b) illustrates the sum of two complex
numbers, z1 and z2, by vector addition using the parallelogram law: we form a
parallelogram with the vectors z1 and z2 and as adjacent sides. Their sum is
the vector that forms the diagonal of the parallelogram, starting at the origin.

Example 10.52 Illustrate the sum of z1 = 5 - i and z2 = -7 + 4i by vector
addition.

Solution.

Draw a vector starting at the origin and end-           8i

ing at the point (5, -1) in the complex plane           z2 z1 + z2
to represent z1, and another vector ending at

(-7, 4) to represent z2. Now sketch the opposite

sides of a parallelogram, and draw the diagonal     -8              z1 8

starting at the origin, as shown at right.

    This vector represents the sum z1 + z2. You can check that the vector ends
at the point

                         z1 + z2 = (5 - 7) + (-1 + 4)i = -2 + 3i

    To visualize subtraction, we add the opposite of the second vector, because

                                      z1 - z2 = z1 + (-z2)

Recall that the opposite of a vector has the same length, but it points in the
opposite direction.

Zeros of Polynomials

A polynomial with real-number coefficients may or may not have real-valued
zeros. For example, the polynomial x4 + 4 has no real-valued zeros. But a
polynomial always has a zero if we allow complex numbers as inputs. Because
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 537

we can add, subtract, and multiply any two complex numbers, we can evaluate
a polynomial function at a complex number. Thus, we can extend the domain
of any polynomial to include all complex numbers.

Example 10.54 Evaluate the polynomial f (x) = x2 - 2x + 2 for x = 1 + i,
and simplify.
Solution. We substitute x = 1 + i, to find

                           f (1 + i) = (1 + i)2 - 2(1 + i) + 2
                                      = 12 + 2i + i2 - 2 - 2i + 2
                                      = 1 + 2i + (-1) - 2 - 2i + 2

Thus, f (1 + i) = 0, so 1 + i is a zero of the polynomial.

Checkpoint 10.55 If f (x) = x2 - 6x + 13, evaluate f (3 + 2i).

Answer. 0
    The zeros of a quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c , of course, are the

solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 , and those solutions are
given by the quadratic formula,

-b b2 - 4ac    -b b2 - 4ac
x= +           and x = -
2a       2a    2a                                                 2a

If the discriminant D = b2 - 4ac is negative, the two solutions are complex
conjugates. For example, the solutions of the equation x2 - 4x + 5 = 0 are

-(-4) ±  (-4)2 - 4(1)(5) 4 ± -4
               =
         2(1)                                                  2

or z = 2 + i and z¯ = 2 - i. Thus, if we know that z = a + bi is one complex
solution of a quadratic equation, we know that z¯ = a - bi is the other solution.

    We can now write a quadratic polynomial, with real coefficients, having
any complex number as one of its zeros. The factored form of the quadratic
polynomial with zeros z and z¯ is

         p(x) = (x - z)(x - z¯)

Expanding the right side, we find
                                  p(x) = x2 - (z + z¯)x + zz¯

Because (z + z¯) and zz¯ are both real numbers, this polynomial has real-valued
coefficients.

                   Complex Zeros of a Quadratic Polynomial.

    If z = a + bi, b = 0, is a complex zero of a quadratic polynomial p(x)
with real coefficients and lead coefficient 1, then z¯ = a - bi is the other
zero, and

              p(x) = (x - z)(x - z¯) = x2 - (z + z¯)x + zz¯

Example 10.56
    a Let z = 7 - 5i. Compute (z + z¯) and zz¯.
    b Find a quadratic polynomial with one zero being z = 7 - 5i.
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 538

Solution.
    a The conjugate of z = 7 - 5i is z¯ = 7 + 5i, so
                                 (z + z¯) = (7 - 5i) + (7 + 5i) = 14
       and
                                   zz¯ = (7 - 5i)(7 + 5i)

One of the most important results in mathematics is the fundamental

theorem of algebra, which says that if we allow complex numbers as inputs,

then every polynomial p(x) of degree n  1 has exactly n complex number

zeros.

         Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

    Let p(x) be a polynomial of degree n  1. Then p(x) has exactly n
complex zeros, counting multiplicities.

Note 10.58 A polynomial has a zero "of multiplicity k" at x = a if (x - a)

occurs k times as a factor of the polynomial. For example, the polynomial
p(x) = (x - 5)2 has a zero of multiplicity 2 at x = 5.

    As a result, every polynomial of degree can be factored as the product of
linear terms.

For example, although the graph of y = x4+4 shown at                           y y = x4 + 4
                                                                             8
right has no x-intercepts, the fundamental theorem tells                     6
us that there are four complex solutions to x4 + 4 = 0 ,                     4
and that x4 + 4 can be factored. You can check that                          2
the four solutions to x4 + 4 = 0 are

         1 + i, - 1 + i, - 1 - i, and 1 - i                           -4 -2          x
                                                                             24

For example, if x = 1 + i, then

         x2 = (1 + i)2 = 1 + 2i + i2 = 2i

and
                                   x4 = (x2)2 = (2i)2 = -4
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 539

Because each zero corresponds to a factor of the polynomial, the factored form
of x4 + 4 is

          x4 + 4 = x - (1 + i)][x - (-1 + i) x - (-1 - i) x - (1 - i)

The four solutions to x4 + 4 = 0 form two complex conjugate pairs, namely
1 ± i and -1 ± i. We see again that, for every polynomial with real coefficients,
the nonreal zeros always occur in complex conjugate pairs.
Example 10.59 Find a fourth degree polynomial with real coefficients, two of
whose zeros are 3i and 2 + i.
Solution. The other two zeros are -3i and 2 - i. The factored form of the
polynomial is

                         (x - 3i)(x + 3i)[x - (2 + i)][x - (2 - i)]
We multiply together the factors to find the polynomial. The product of
(x - 3i)(x + 3i) is x2 + 9, and

          [x - (2 + i)][x - (2 - i)] = x2 - (2 + i + 2 - i)x + (2 + i)(2 - i)
                                          = x2 - 4x + 5

Finally, we multiply these two partial products to find the polynomial we seek,

                 (x2 + 9)(x2 - 4x + 5) = x4 - 4x3 + 14x2 - 36x + 45

                                           Imaginary Unit.

                We define the imaginary unit, i, by
                                    i2 = -1 or i = -1

2 The square root of a negative number is an imaginary number: if a >
   0, -a = i a

3 A complex number z is the sum of a real number and an imaginary
   number, z = a + bi.

4 We can perform the four arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

                        Operations on Complex Numbers.

z1 + z2 = (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i

z1 - z2 = (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i

z1z2 = (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

z1 a + bi a + bi c - di ac + bd bc - ad
=                    =  ·  = 2 2 + 2 2i
z2 c + di c + di c - di c + d c + d

5 The product of a nonzero complex number and its conjugate is always a
   positive real number.

            zz¯ = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a2 - b2i2 = a2 - b2(-1) = a2 + b2.

6 We can graph complex numbers in the complex plane.

7 We can visualize the sum of two complex numbers by vector addition in
   the complex plane.

The vectors are shown at right. We see that               4i                  z
multiplication by i corresponds to rotating the   iz 2i                       24
vector around the origin by 90 in the counter-
clockwise direction.                             -4 -2
                                                        -2i

                                                                         -4i

Checkpoint 10.62
    a Let z = 1 + i, and calculate iz, i2z, and i3z.
    b Plot z, iz, i2z, and i3z as points on the complex plane.

Answer.
    a iz = i - 1, i2z = -1 - i, i3z = -i + 1

      iz     z = 1+i
b

     i2z          i3z

    The previous example suggests that multiplication by a complex number
results in a rotation. Polar coordinates are well suited to processes that involve
rotation, because they use angles to specify location. Thus, we will next
represent complex numbers in an alternate polar form.

Polar Form

The figure below shows the complex number z = 3 + 3i, represented as a vector
in the complex plane. The distance r from the origin to z is

                                                             
                                     r = 32 + 32 = 3 2

                                                                      
and the angle from the real axis to the vector is  = .

                                                                      4

Using right triangle trigonometry, we see that   3                                      3 + 3i

                                                                         =
                       1

In general, we can write the real and imaginary parts of z in terms of r and

 as

                       a = r cos() and b = r sin()
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 545

Thus, the complex number z = a + bi can also be written as

             z = (r cos()) + (r sin())i or z = r(cos() + i sin()).
                                                             

Example 10.63 Find the polar form for z = 3 + i.
Solution. We compute

                 2 2 1
       r = a + b = 3 + 1 = 2 and tan() = 

                                                                        3

The angle  is in the first quadrant, so                                     
                                                     1 3+i
       -1 1                
        = tan  =                                           r=2
                    36                                                  

                                                                  =
                                                                        6
                                                                         
                                                                            3

Thus, z = 2 cos     + i sin

       Polar Form for a Complex Number.

The complex number z = a + bi can be written in the polar form

where                    z = r cos() + i sin()
            
       r = a2 + b2 and  is defined by

       a = r cos(), b = r sin(), 0    2

The angle  is called the argument of the complex number, and r is
its length, or modulus.

                                                                        
Checkpoint 10.64 Find the polar form for w = 1 + i 3.

                           
Answer. w = 2 cos + i sin
                 3         3

    Of course, we can always recover the Cartesian form of a complex number
from its polar form by evaluating the trigonometric functions. We'll check the
result of the previous example:

                 z=2   cos               + i sin  
                   =2
                              6                   6

                           3             1     
                                            = 3+i
                           2  +i·        2

Products and Quotients in Polar Form

The polar form is especially convenient for computing the product or quotient
of two complex numbers.
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 546

                               Product in Polar Form.
       If z1 = r(cos() + i sin()) and z2 = R(cos() + i sin()), then

                    z1z2 = rR (cos( + ) + i sin( + )

    This formula, which you will prove in the Homework Problems, says that
the product of two complex numbers in polar form is the complex number with
modulus rR and argument  + . Thus, to find the product of two complex
numbers, we multiply their lengths and add their arguments.

Example 10.65 Find the product of z = 2 cos             + i sin           and w =

                                                     6           6

Solution. We multiply the moduli, 2 · 2 = 4, and add the arguments, + =

  . The polar form of the product is thus
2

                   zw = 4 cos     + i sin               = 4i

                               2                  2

Note that z and w are the numbersfrom the previous Example and Exercise,
namely z = 3 + i and w = 1 + i 3. You can compute the product zw in
Cartesian form to check that you get the same result, 4i.

The figure at right shows the graphs of z and                    zw
w, and their product, zw. You can see that                           w
multiplying z by w rotates the graph of z by the                       z
argument of w, namely  or 60.                                        12345

Powers and Roots of Complex Numbers

Because raising to a power is just repeated multiplication, we can also use
the polar form to simplify powers of a complex number. For example, if
z = r(cos() + i sin()), then

                   z2 = z · z = r · r(cos( + ) + i sin( + ))

We compute z2 by squaring the modulus, r, and doubling the argument, , so

the polar form is

                            z2 = r2(cos(2) + i sin(2))

An analogous result holds for all positive integers n, and is known as De Moivre's
Theorem.

                            De Moivre's Theorem.

       If z = r(cos() + i sin()) is a complex number in polar form, and n
   is a positive integer, then

                   zn = rn(cos(n) + i sin(n))

                                     
Example 10.69 Raise z = 3 + i to the fourth power.

Solution. We use the polar form, z = 2 cos              + i sin           , and apply

                                                 6               6

                   z4 = 24 cos 4 ·  + i sin 4 ·

Answer. 4 2 + 4 2i

    DeMoivre's Theorem also works for fractional values of n, so we can compute
                                                                                                    1

roots of complex numbers. For example, by applying the theorem with n = ,
                                                                                                    2

we see that one of the square roots of z = r cos() + i sin() is

   z1/2 = r1/2 cos  + i sin 
                                         2              2

Now, every number,whether real or complex, has two square roots. To find the
other root, remember that we can add a multiple of 2 to the argument of z,
that is, we can also write the polar form of z as

                       z = r(cos( + 2) + i sin( + 2))

The second square root of z is thus

r1/2 cos  +  + i sin  + 
                          2                          2

                                                                        2                              2
As an example consider w = -8+8i 3, whose polar form is 16 cos                + i sin                     ,
                                                                        3                              3

or by adding 2 to the argument, 16 cos             8    + i sin  8     . The two

                                                   3             3

square roots of w are

z1 = 161/2 cos  + i sin                         1 3 
                                         =4 +i              = 2 + 2i 3
   3                         3                  22

z2 = 161/2 cos 4 + i sin 4                         -1 -3 
                                            =4          +i       = -2 - 2i 3
                       3              3            2        2

You can verify that both of these numbers are square w
roots of w = -8 + 8i 3, for instance,

2                                          + 12i2                       z1
2 + 2i 3 = 4 + 2(2) 2i 3
                                                                          5 10 15
                                                                 z2
                       = -8 + 8i 3

The graphs of w and its two square roots are shown at
right.

    It is not hard to show that every number has three complex cube roots, four
complex fourth roots, and so on.

Example 10.71 Find three complex cube roots of 8.
Solution. One polar form of z = 8 is

                          z = 8(cos 0 + i sin 0)
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 549

so one of its cube roots is

         z1 = 81/3 cos 0 + i sin 0          = 2(cos 0 + i sin 0) = 2
                             3         3

But by adding multiples of 2 to the argument, we can also write the polar
form of as

         z = 8(cos 2 + i sin 2) and z = 8(cos 4 + i sin 4)

    Applying De Moivre's theorem to each of these expressions gives us two

                            Polar Form for a Complex Number.

           The complex number z = a + bi can be written in the polar
       form

                                  z = r(cos() + i sin())

       where

                                  r = a2 + b2

       and  is defined by

              a = r cos(), b = r sin(), 0    2

       The angle  is called the argument of the complex number, and

Key Concepts

              Polar Coordinates.

    The polar coordinates of a point P in the plane are (r, ),
where

1 · |r| is the distance from to the pole,       P

·  is the angle measured counterclock-     r    y
   wise from the polar axis to the ray
   through P from the pole.

                                           
                                             x

                 Non-Uniqueness of Polar Coordinates.

2 1 Any point with polar coordinates (r, ) also has coordinates
          (r,  + 2k), where k is an integer.

       2 The point (r, ) can also be designated by (-r,  + ).
       3 The pole has coordinates (0, ), for any value of .

3 In the polar plane, the coordinate grid lines are circles centered at the
   pole, with equations r = k, and lines through the pole, with equations
    = k.
                                  Conversion Equations.

    4 1 To convert from polar coordinates (r, ) to Cartesian:

                                              x = r cos()
                                              y = r sin()

            2 To convert from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar:

                                             r = x2 + y2
                                                          y

                                             tan() =
                                                          x

            where the choice of  depends on the quadrant.

5 To convert an equation from Cartesian to polar coordinates, we replace
   each x with r cos() and each with y with r sin). To convert an equation
   from polar to Cartesian coordinates, look for expressions of the form
   r cos(), r sin(), r2, or tan().

6 When graphing an equation in polar coordinates, we think of sweeping
   around the pole in the counterclockwise direction, and at each angle 
   the r-value tells us how far the graph is from the pole.
CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 556

    7 Standard graphs in polar coordinates include circles and roses, cardioids
       and limaçons, lemniscates, and spirals.

    8 To find the intersection points of the polar graphs r = f () and r = g()
       we solve the equation f () = g(). In addition, we should always check

                                           Imaginary Unit.

                We define the imaginary unit, i, by
                                    i2 = -1 or i = -1

10 The square root of a negative number is an imaginary number: if a >
    0, -a = i a

11 A complex number z is the sum of a real number and an imaginary
    number, z = a + bi.

12 We can perform the four arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

                          Operations on Complex Numbers.

z1 + z2 = (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i

z1 - z2 = (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i

z1z2 = (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i

z1 a + bi a + bi c - di ac + bd bc - ad
=  =  ·  = 2 2 + 2 2i
z2 c + di c + di c - di c + d c + d

13 The product of a nonzero complex number and its conjugate is always a
    positive real number.

             zz¯ = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a2 - b2i2 = a2 - b2(-1) = a2 + b2.

14 We can graph complex numbers in the complex plane.

15 We can visualize the sum of two complex numbers by vector addition in
    the complex plane.

                          Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

             Let p(x) be a polynomial of degree n  1. Then p(x) has
         exactly n complex zeros.

17 The nonreal zeros of a polynomial with real coefficients always occur in
    conjugate pairs.

18 Multiplying a complex number by i rotates its graph by 90 around the
    origin.

CHAPTER 10. POLAR COORDINATES AND COMPLEX NUMBERS 557

       Polar Form for a Complex Number.

    The complex number z = a + bi can be written in the polar
form

                           z = r(cos() + i sin())

where

                    r = a2 + b2

and  is defined by

       a = r cos(), b = r sin(), 0    2

The angle  is called the argument of the complex number, and
r is its length, or modulus.

                        Product and Quotient in Polar Form.

             If z1 = r(cos  + i sin ) and z2 = R(cos  + i sin ), then

                            z1z2 = rR(cos( + ) + i sin( + ))

         and z1 r
                                 = (cos( - ) + i sin( - ))

                             z2 R

21
                                   De Moivre's Theorem.

             If z = r(cos() + i sin()) is a complex number in polar form,
         and n is a positive integer, then

                                 zn = rn(cos(n) + i sin(n))

22
                              Roots of a Complex Number.

             A complex number z = r(cos() + i sin()) in polar form has
         n complex nth roots, given by

zk = r1/n cos  + 2k + i sin  + 2k
                                 n  n

a  and  are complements.

    b sin() = cos() and cos() = sin(). The side opposite  is the side
       adjacent to , and vice versa.

53.

a As  increases, tan() increases also. The side opposite  increases in
   length while the side adjacent to  remains fixed.

b As  increases, cos() decreases. The side adjacent to  remains fixed
   while the hypotenuse increases in length.

55. As  decreases toward 0, the side opposite  approaches a length of 0,
so sin () approaches 0. But as  increases toward 90, the length of the side

opposite  approaches the length of the hypotenuse, so sin() approaches 1.

         a First figure: b - x is the base of the small right triangle. Second: -x
            is the horizontal distance between P and the x-axis, so b + (-x) or
            b - x is the base of the large right triangle. Third: x = 0, and b is
            the base of a right triangle.

         b First: x and y are the legs of a right triangle, a is the hypotenuse.
            Second: -x and y are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse a.
            Third: x = 0 and y = a

         c x = a cos(C)

              b2 + c2 = (a2 + c2 - 2ac cos(B)) + (a2 + b2 - 2bc cos(C))
                        = 2a2 + b2 + c2 - 2a(c cos(B) + b cos(C))

so 2a2 = 2a(c cos(B) + b cos(C)), and dividing both sides by 2a yields a =
(c cos(B) + b cos(C)

61. For the first equation, start with the Law of Cosines in the form
                                   a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bc cos(A)

Add 2ab + 2bc cos(A) - a2 to both sides of the equation, factor the right side,
then divide both sides by 2bc.

                                    b2 + c2 - 2bc cos(A) = a2

Add 2bc - b2 - c2 to both sides of the equation, factor the right side, then divide
 both sides by 2bc.

For the point P where r = 1, cos() = x, sin() = y. The arc of length t is

spanned by an angle  in standard position. Because arclength is r and r = 1,

t = , so x = cos(t), y = sin(t).

    77. The two right triangles shown are similar, so their sides are proportional.
    The hypotenuse of the large triangle is r times the hypotenuse of the small
    triangle, so the two legs of the large triangle must be r times the legs of
    the small triangle. Thus, because the coordinates of the vertex on the unit
    circle are (cos(), sin()), the coordinates of P must be (r cos(), r sin()).

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

<http://www.fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License
preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while
not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works
of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements
the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come
with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS. This License applies to
any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.
Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute
the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
and/or translated into another language.

                                                 666
APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE  667

    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers
or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary
Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter
of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not
identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-
Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is
released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and
a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public,
that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text
editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or
discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image
format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include propri-
etary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
some word processors for output purposes only.

    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires
to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title
page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance
of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

    The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the
Document to the public.

    A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text
that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific
section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
"Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
according to this definition.

    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers
APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE  668

are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING. You may copy and distribute the Document
in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you
make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
the conditions in section 3.

    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY. If you publish printed copies (or copies
in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering
more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher
of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of
the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover,
and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-
network location from which the general network-using public has access to
download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy
of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must
take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies
in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at
the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version
of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

   A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that
       of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE  669

       there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You
       may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
       that version gives permission.

   B. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
       as the publisher.

   C. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

  D. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
       the other copyright notices.

   E. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
       the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
       License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

   F. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
       required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

  G. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

  H. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of
       the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section
       Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
       authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then
       add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous
       sentence.

    I. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
       access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
       locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
       These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
       location for a work that was published at least four years before the
       Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
       gives permission.

   J. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve
       the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance
       and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
       given therein.

  K. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text
       and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered
       part of the section titles.

   L. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
       included in the Modified Version.

  M. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

  N. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE  670

Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other
section titles.

    You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties -- for
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one
of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement
of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS. You may combine the Document with
other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section
4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list
them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and
that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make
the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS. You may make a collection
consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License,
and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with
a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.

    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into
the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding
verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS. A compila-
tion of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent
documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used
to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License
APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE  671

does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the
Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers
that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so
you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in
the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions of those
notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and
the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version
will prevail.

    If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will
typically require changing the actual title.

9. TERMINATION. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt oth-
erwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a
copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE. The Free Software
Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation
License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that
has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
APPENDIX B. GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE  672

Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

11. RELICENSING. "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC
Site") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works
and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive
Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of
copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

    "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corpora-
tion with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as
future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

    "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

    An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and
if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than
this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC,
(1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated
prior to November 1, 2008.

    The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided
the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
