About this project

The goal of this textbook is to provide an edition of Euclid's Elements that is easy
to read, inexpensive, and has been released under an open culture license.1

The title Euclid's "Elements" Redux indicates that while this edition states and
proves Euclid's results, the proofs have been rewritten using modern mathematics.
This is because mathematics has almost completely changed since The Elements
was published c. 300 BC.

In Euclid's Hellenistic culture, a number was synonymous with a length that could
be measured. This gave Euclid access to all of the positive numbers but neither zero
nor the negatives. But since the development of algebra wouldn't begin for another
millennium, Euclid could not have known that the result of Book I, Proposition 47
would be summarized as a2 + b2 = c2.

When a modern student encounters the original Elements for the first time, he
or she encounters two problems: the logic of the proof, and Euclid's now archaic
concept of numbers. This edition updates Euclid's proofs while retaining his funda-
mental results.

It may be impossible to overstate how fundamental these results are to mathemat-
ics. They are the primary reason why The Elements was the world's most important
mathematics textbook for about 2,200 years.

Let that number sink in for a moment... one math textbook was used by much of
the literate world for over two thousand years. Why should this be? Lack of com-
petition? At certain times and places, yes, but in schools where Euclid's Elements
got a foothold, other textbooks soon followed. Therefore, this can't be the complete
answer.

8  CHAPTER 0. ABOUT THIS PROJECT

Elegant proofs? While Euclid's originals remain a model for how proofs should be
written, they aren't irreplaceable.

Content? Until the development of algebra and calculus, The Elements covered
everything a novice mathematician needed to know. And even after the advent of
calculus, The Elements still had its place. Isaac Newton's assistant claimed that
in five years of service, he had heard Newton laugh just once: a student asked
if Euclid was still relevant, and Newton laughed at him. But most students only
studied the first six Books (i.e., the first six of the thirteen scrolls that made up the
original Elements). Therefore, not everyone studied The Elements exclusively for
its content.

So, whatever is valuable about The Elements must be present in its first half; but
each Book begins with a foundation (definitions and axioms) and builds upwards
one proposition at a time.

This, I think, is the key to the question: not only does The Elements help a student
learn geometry, but it also immerses the student in a logical system that is as useful
as it is penetrating. While learning algebra helps a student to perform calculus and
statistics, learning geometric proofs from The Elements helps a student to think
clearly about politics, art, music, design, coding, law... any subject that requires
rational thought can be better understood after Euclid.

The reason The Elements was needed in the past, and why it's needed to-
day, is that it helps its readers learn to think clearly.

But if The Elements is a good textbook, why was it abandoned at the end of the 19th
century?

Mathematics faced a crisis in the last half of that century - ambiguous definitions
and sloppy logic had led to serious contradictions. Without a complete overhaul of
common definitions and the construction of formal logic, mathematics would have
collapsed.

After several decades of work by many brilliant minds, the overhaul was completed,
leading to a mathematical golden age which is still unfolding. But that overhaul
made Euclid's weaknesses clear: while his logic remained sound, the presentation
of that logic was outdated. Euclid's definitions and assumptions were ambiguous
to the point of being unworkable. Most seriously, other geometries had been devel-
oped, proving that Euclid's work was not unique.

As calculus developed into the foundation of engineering and the sciences, its pre-
requisite, algebra, became the course every student seemed to require. Geometric
proofs became a luxury rather than a necessity. With perfect hindsight, the error
is clear - forcing each and every student to learn algebra has only succeeded in
teaching students to hate "math" (which millions of people associate exclusively
with algebra) while hindering their attempts to think logically.

The way forward is also clear - either to rewrite The Elements or to develop a new,
equivalent work. I have opted to rewrite Euclid in the hope that The Elements will
                                                                           9

again be recognized as a textbook of introductory, axiomatic geometry, a model of
proof-writing, and a case-study in applied logic.2

Like all math textbooks, Euclid's "Elements" Redux requires its student to work
slowly and carefully through each section. The student should confirm each result
and not take anything on faith. While this process may seem tedious, it is exactly
this attention to detail which separates those who understand mathematics from
those who do not.

This edition also contains homework problems and a partial answer key. However,
no prerequisites are required if the student's goal is to read and understand the
material. The best way to demonstrate this understanding is to memorize a certain
number of proofs and then recite them on request. This was how Abraham Lincoln
made use of The Elements:

In the course of my law-reading, I constantly came upon the word demon-
strate. I thought at first that I understood its meaning, but soon became
satisfied that I did not. I said to myself, "What do I mean when I demon-
strate more than when I reason or prove? How does demonstration dif-
fer from any other proof?" ... I consulted all the dictionaries and books
of reference I could find, but with no better results. You might as well
have defined blue to a blind man. At last I said, "Lincoln, you can never
make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means;" and
I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and
stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid
at sight. I then found out what "demonstrate" means, and went back to
my law-studies.3

If the student intends to prove some of the problems, then proportions, algebra,
trigonometry, and possibly linear algebra will be helpful. Students with no knowl-
edge of proof writing should consult Richard Hammack's "Book of Proof ", 3rd ed.4

It is vitally important to understand that, in the mind of mathematicians, math
is a collection of statements about relationships between quantities which can be
proven. Without proofs, mathematics does not exist.

0.2 Dedication

This book is dedicated to everyone in the educational community who believes that
algebra provides a better introduction to mathematics than geometry.

0.3 Who needs a new edition of Euclid's Elements?

Consider an analogous question: who needs training wheels on a bike?
A young person who doesn't know how to ride a bicycle.
Experienced mathematicians may no longer need Euclid, but Euclid's construction
of complex ideas from simple axioms remains a model for how mathematics should
be approached. Students who attempt to master Euclid's Elements will find 21st
century mathematics less confusing despite Euclid's less-than-rigorous definitions.

0.4 Why rewrite Euclid's Elements?

The concept that Euclid could use a little tweaking goes back a long way. Book
I, Proposition 40 has been identified as an interpolation, along with many of The
Elements' lemmas and corollaries. Some editions include the apocryphal Books XIV
and XV which add results on the topic of solid geometry.

It's important to realize that no math textbook is perfect; flaws will inevitably come
to light after centuries of close study by intelligent minds.

But it's also important to realize that more than one correct geometry exists; Eu-
clid's geometry is one of many (but perhaps the easiest to learn). Similarly, for any
true and logical result, either more than one proof exists or the potential for more
than one proof exists. Euclid's proofs need not be treated as special because they
are "the originals".12

There at least two reasons for this. First, a student of mathematics should always
ask if there is another way to prove an interesting theorem. Doing so may provide
insight, if not help generate a new result.

Second, it's doubtful that Euclid (if indeed he was a single individual) is the sole
author of these proofs. It's more likely that he (or the scholars of his school) com-
piled and rewrote these proofs from difference sources. Rewriting and editing is
part of a mathematician's work.

This is not to denigrate the achievement of "The Elements" - the original thirteen
books may have been the first to demonstrate how to construct hundreds of complex

  12Some of the proofs in this text are not based on Euclid's originals.  The originals can be found in

several printed editions, online at David E. Joyce's Euclid's Elements:

structures beginning with first principles. Nearly all well-written math, physics,
and engineering textbooks follow a similar format (and all of the bad ones do not).

But is still the case that Euclid's original proofs are obsolete - they refer to a con-
ception of mathematics that is no longer viable because it cannot be extended to
produce real analysis, complex analysis, etc. To help see this, consider Euclid's
original proof of [1.3]:

Book I, Proposition 3: For two given unequal straight-lines, to cut off the greater a
straight-line equal to the lesser.

Proof. Let AB and C be the two given unequal straight-lines, of which let the
greater be AB. So it is required to cut off a straight-line equal to the lesser C from
the greater AB.

Let the line AD, equal to the straight-line C, have been placed at point A. And let
the circle have been drawn with center A and radius AD.

    Figure 0.4.1: Book I, Proposition 3 (original on the left, rewrite on the right)

And since point A is the center of circle DEF, AE is equal to AD. But, C is also equal
to AD. Thus, AE and C are each equal to AD. So AE is also equal to C.
Thus, for two given unequal straight-lines, AB and C, the (straight-line) AE, equal
to the lesser C, has been cut off from the greater AB. (Which is) the very thing it
was required to do.13

Compare the original to the rewritten proof below:
Given two arbitrary segments which are unequal in length, it is possible to subdivide
the larger segment such that one of its two sub-segments is equal in length to the
smaller segment.

Proof. Construct segments AB and CG such that CG < AB. We claim that AB
may be subdivided into segments AE and EB where AE = CG.

  13From Richard Fitzpatrick's "Euclid's Elements of Geometry".
0.5. RECOMMENDED READING  13

From point A, construct the segment AD such that AD = CG [1.2]. With A as the
center and AD as radius, construct the circle A [Postulate 1.3] which intersects
AB at E.

Because A is the center of A, AE = AD [Def. 1.32]. Since AD = CG by construc-
tion, by Axiom 9 from section 1.3.1 (using equalities), we find that AE = CG, which
proves our claim.

Students should construct figures and/or work through the proofs step-by-step.
This is an essential component to the learning process that cannot be avoided. The
old saying, "There is no royal road to geometry", means: "No one learns math for
free."

1.1 Symbols, Logic, and Definitions

The propositions of Euclid will be referred to in brackets; for example, we1 write
[3.32] instead of writing Proposition 3.32. Axioms, Definitions, etc., will also be
referred to in this way; for example, Definition 12 in chapter 1 will be written as
[Def. 1.12]. Exercises to problems will be written as [3.5, #1] instead of exercise 1
of Proposition 3.5.
Numbered equations will be written as (10.2.2) instead of the second equation in

A note on the exercises: do some of them but don't feel pressured to do all of them.
Generally, an exercise is expected to be solved using the propositions, corollaries,
and exercises that preceded it. For example, exercise [1.32, #3] should first be at-
tempted using propositions [1.1]-[1.32] as well as all previous exercises. Should
this prove too difficult or too frustrating, he or she should consider whether propo-
sitions [1.33] or later (and their exercises) might help solve the exercise. It is also
permissible to use trigonometry, linear algebra, or other contemporary mathemat-
ical techniques on challenging problems.2

    1Mathematicians often write "we" when writing about math in the same way that coaches tell players
"here's what we're going to do" - we are engaged in a team effort to overcome our difficulties.

    2And remember that math makes everyone feel stupid at times. Never give up.

1.1.1 Symbols

The following symbols will be used to denote standard geometric shapes or rela-
tionships:

    · Circles are denoted by: . When the center of a circle is known (for example,
       point A), the circle will be identified as A. Otherwise, the circle will be
       identified with points on its circumference, such as ABC.

    · Triangles by: 

    · Parallelograms by: 
    · Parallel lines by: 

    · Perpendicular lines by: 

In addition to these, we shall employ the usual symbols of algebra: +, -, =, <, >,
, , =, as well as a few additional symbols:

    · Composition:  For example, suppose we have the segments AB and BC
       which intersect at the point B. The statement AB + BC refers to the sum of
       their lengths, but AB  BC refers to their composition as one object. See Fig.
       1.1.1.

Figure 1.1.1: Composition: the geometrical object AB  BC is a single object com-
posed of two segments, AB and BC.

       The composition of angles, however, can be written using either + or , and
       in this textbook their composition will be written with +.

    · Similar:  Two figures or objects are similar if they have the same shape
       but not necessarily the same size. If two similar objects have the same size,
       they are also congruent.

    · Congruence: = Two figures or objects are congruent if they have the same
       shape and size, or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of
       the other. This means that an object can be re-positioned and reflected so as
       to coincide precisely with the other object without resizing.3

1.1. SYMBOLS, LOGIC, AND DEFINITIONS  17

1.1.2 Logic

Propositions are mathematical statements that are either completely true or com-
pletely false, but never both.4 Some examples and counterexamples:

· "A triangle has two sides" is a false proposition.
· "A triangle has three sides" is a true proposition.
· "A triangle has three sides?" is not a proposition; it is a question, not a state-

   ment.
· "Draw a triangle" is not a proposition; it is a command.

Propositions which are true may be divided into axioms and theorems. An axiom
needs no proof, and a theorem requires at least one proof; both axioms and theo-
rems are considered true. A proposition which cannot be proven true is neither an
axiom nor a theorem and is considered false. (Minor spoiler: all propositions in this
book will be shown to be true, i.e., they are theorems.)

An axiom is a proposition that is assumed to be true without proof 5. They are
considered so fundamental that they cannot be inferred from any proposition which
is more elementary. "Any two sides of a triangle are greater in length than the third
side" may be self-evident; however, it is not an axiom since it can be inferred by
demonstration from other propositions. The statement "two objects which are equal
in length to a third object are also equal in length to each other" is self-evident, and
so it is considered an axiom.6

A theorem is a proposition that may be proven from known propositions (either
theorems or axioms). Theorems may also be described as formal statements of
mathematical or logical properties.

A proof is a rigorous mathematical argument which unequivocally demonstrates
the truth of a given proposition7. A proof consists of three parts: the hypothesis,
that which is assumed, the claim, that which the author intends to prove, and
the bulk of the proof which demonstrates how the claim must be true once the
hypothesis is assumed to be true.

A corollary is an inference or deduction based on a theorem which usually states
a small but important result that follows immediately from the proof itself or from

    4Propositions are also never partly true. If your dog has brown fur except for one white paw, the
proposition "Your dog is brown" is false.

    6Whether a given statement is considered an axiom or a theorem depends on which textbook you are
reading. Graduate textbook authors may require students to prove statements which were considered
axiomatic at the undergraduate level.

the result of the theorem. For example, if a theorem states that all prime num-
                                                                                                           

bers have irrational square roots, then one corollary to this theorem is that 2 is
irrational.8

A lemma is a theorem which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather
than as a statement of interest by itself.9 While technically all lemmas are theo-
rems, lemmas are not called theorems in order to communicate the idea that the
result is of minor importance and exists to help prove something more profound.10

1.1.2.1 Examples

Proposition. (1) If x is a rational number, then x has a decimal expansion.

The hypothesis is that "x is a rational number", and the claim is that "x has a
decimal expansion" (i.e., it can be written in decimal form). In order to prove this
proposition is a theorem, we begin by assuming that x is a rational number (e.g., a
fraction). From this, we must show logically that x has a decimal expansion. If we
can do this, we have written a proof, turning this proposition into a theorem.11

Converse statements: if we rewrite the above proposition by swapping the hypothe-
sis and the claim, we obtain its converse statement:

Proposition. (2) If x has a decimal expansion, then x is a rational number.

Since this proposition is false, it has no proof and therefore is not a theorem.

     There is no guarantee that the converse of a given proposition will be true.

From propositions (1) and (2), we may infer two others: their contrapositive propo-
sitions (informally called contrapositives). The contrapositive forms of proposition
(1):

Proposition. (3) If x does not have a decimal expansion, then x is not a rational
number.

The contrapositive forms of proposition (2):

Proposition. (4) If x is not a rational number, then x does not have a decimal
expansion.

Unlike converse propositions, a contrapositive proposition is true if and only if the
original proposition is true. Since (1) is true, (3) is true; since (3) is true, (1) is true.
Similarly, a contrapositive proposition is false if and only if the original proposition
is false: since (2) is false, (4) is false; since (4) is false, (2) is false.

    8This important result will not be proven here. Interested readers should consult Dummit & Foote's
"Abstract Algebra", 3rd edition.

   9Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(mathematics)
  10The difference between a lemma and a theorem is often determined by the author. For example, it
could be considered that propositions 1-46 in Chapter 1 are lemmas leading toward propositions 47-48,
which are the most profound statements in the chapter.
  11While this is indeed a theorem, we will not prove it here.
1.1. SYMBOLS, LOGIC, AND DEFINITIONS  19

1.1.3 Definitions

We need a common language in order to discuss similar experiences or ideas. For
mathematics, this is true to an almost ridiculous degree. A mathematician's work
can be rendered useless if the definitions he or she employs turn out to be vague or
sloppy.12

Students reading this section for the first time may wish to read definitions 1-6 and
9-11 and then skip ahead to [1.4], returning to the remaining definitions as well as
[1.2] and [1.3] as needed.

The Point

1. A point is a zero dimensional object.13 A geometrical object which has three
dimensions (length, height, and width) is a solid. A geometrical object which has
two dimensions (length and height) is a surface, and a geometrical object which has
one dimension is a line or line segment. Since a point has none of these, it has zero
dimensions.

The Line

2. A line is a one dimensional object: it has only length. If it had any height or
width, no matter how small, it would have two dimensions. Hence14, a line has
neither height nor width.

                                                        
A line with points A and B is written as AB.

(This definition conforms to Euclid's original definition in which a line need not be
straight. However, in all modern geometry texts, it is understood that a "line" has
no curves. See also [Def 1.4].)

3. The intersections of lines are points. However, a point may exist without being
the intersection of lines.

4. A line without a curve is called a straight line. It is understood throughout this
textbook that a line refers exclusively to a straight line. A curved line (such as the
circumference of a circle) will never be referred to merely as a line in order to avoid
confusion. Lines have no endpoints since they are infinite in length.

A line segment (or more simply a segment) is similar to a line except that it is finite
in length and has two endpoints at its extremities. A line segment with endpoints

  12Euclid's original definitions are almost useless to modern mathematicians. One example: Euclid
defines a line as either straight or curved and either finite or infinite in length. This type of vagueness,
common until the early 19th century, was one reason why mathematics had to be rewritten into its
modern form.

  14"Hence", along with "thus" and "therefore", are three words that mathematicians use to mean "con-
sequently" or "for this reason". Generally, "hence" is used for minor results, "thus" for major results, and
"therefore" for results in between. However, YMMV.
20         CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

A and B is written as AB. (If the length of a segment appears in a fraction, we will

omit  the  overline.  For  example,  1  =  AB  for  any  segment  AB.)
                                           AB

A ray is like a line in that it is infinite in length; however, it has one endpoint. A
                                                                --

ray with endpoint A and point B is written as AB (where A is the endpoint).

                                            
Figure 1.1.2: [Def. 1.2, 1.3, 1.4] AB is a line, CD is a segment (sometimes called a

                          --
line segment), and EF is a ray

The Plane

5. A surface has two dimensions: length and height. It has no width; if it had, it
would be a space of three dimensions.

6. A plane is a surface that extends infinitely far and is assumed to be completely
flat. A plane is the two-dimensional analogue of a point (zero dimensions), a line
(one dimension) and three-dimensional space. Planes act as the setting for most
of Euclidean geometry; that is, "the plane" refers to the whole space in which two-
dimensional geometry is performed.

Planes are defined by three points. For any three points not on the same line, there
exists one and only one plane which contains all three points.

7. Any combination of points, lines, line segments, or curves on a plane is called
a plane figure. A plane figure that is bounded by a finite number of straight line
segments closed in a loop to form a closed chain or circuit is called a polygon15.
All bounded plane figures have a measure called area. Area16 is the quantity that
expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape on a plane. Area can
be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be
necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to
cover the surface with a single coat.

Area is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional
concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). Surface area is its
analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object.17

8. Points which lie on the same straight line, ray, or segment are called collinear
points.

1.1. SYMBOLS, LOGIC, AND DEFINITIONS  21

Figure 1.1.3: [Def 1.11] Notice that both angles could be referred to as BAC,
CAB, or the angle at point A where A is a vertex.

The Angle

9. The angle made by two straight lines, segments, or rays extending outward from
a common point but in different directions is called a rectilinear angle (or simply
an angle).

10. The one point of intersection between straight lines, rays, or segments is called
the vertex of the angle.

11. A particular angle in a figure will be written as the symbol  and three letters,
such as BAC, of which the middle letter, A, is at the vertex. Hence, such an angle
may be referred to either as BAC or CAB. Occasionally, this notation will be
shortened to "the angle at point A" instead of naming the angle as above.

12. The angle formed by composing two or more angles is called their sum. Thus in
Fig. 1.1.4, we find that ABC  P QR = ABR where the segment QP is applied
to the segment BC. We generally write ABC + P QR = ABR to express this
concept.

Figure 1.1.4: [Def. 1.12]

                                         Figure 1.1.5: [Def. 1.13]

13. Suppose two segments BA, AD are composed such that BA  AD = BD where
BD is a segment (see Fig. 1.1.5). If a point C which is not on the segment BD
is connected to point A, then the angles BAC and CAD are called supplements
22  CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

of each other. This definition holds when we replace segments by straight lines or
rays, mutatis mutandis18.

14. When one segment, AE, stands on another segment, BD, such that the adjacent
angles on either side of AE are equal (that is, EAD = EAB), each of the angles
is called a right angle, and the segment which stands on the other is described as
perpendicular to the other (or sometimes the perpendicular to the other). (See Fig.
1.1.5.)

We may write that AE is perpendicular to DB or more simply that AE  DB. It
follows that the supplementary angle of a right angle is another right angle.

Multiple perpendicular lines on a many-sided object may be referred to as the ob-
ject's perpendiculars.

The above definition holds for straight lines and rays, mutatis mutandis.

A line segment within a triangle that runs from a vertex to an opposite side and is
perpendicular to that side is usually referred to an altitude of the triangle, although
it could be referred to in a general sense as a perpendicular of the triangle.

15. An acute angle is one which is less than a right angle. DAB in Fig. 1.1.6 is an
acute angle.

16. An obtuse angle is one which is greater than a right angle. EAB in Fig. 1.1.6
is an obtuse angle. The supplement of an acute angle is obtuse, and conversely, the
supplement of an obtuse angle is acute.

17. When the sum of two angles is a right angle, each is called the complement of
the other. See Fig. 1.1.6.

Figure 1.1.6: [Def. 1.17] The angle BAC is a right angle. Since BAC = CAD +
DAB, it follows that the angles BAD and DAC are each complements of the
other.

Concurrent Lines

18. Three or more straight lines intersecting the same point are called concurrent
lines. This definition holds for rays and segments, mutatis mutandis.
19. The common point through which the rays pass is called the vertex.

  18Mutatis mutandis is a Latin phrase meaning "changing [only] those things which need to be
changed" or more simply "[only] the necessary changes having been made". Source: http://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutatis_mutandis
1.1. SYMBOLS, LOGIC, AND DEFINITIONS  23

The Triangle

20. A triangle is a polygon formed by three segments joined at their endpoints.
These three segments are called the sides of the triangle. One side in particular
may be referred to as the base of the triangle for explanatory reasons, but there is
no fundamental difference between the properties of a base and the properties of
either of the two remaining sides of a triangle. An exception to this is the isosceles
triangle where two sides are equal in length: the third side is sometimes referred
to as the base.

The formula for the area of a triangle is defined as

                                                          1
                                                   A = bh

                                                          2

where b =the length of a particular side, and h =the length of a perpendicular
segment from the base to a vertex.

The area of a triangle is zero if and only if its vertices are collinear.

21. A triangle whose three sides are unequal in length is called scalene (the left-
hand triangle in Fig. 1.1.7). A triangle with two equal sides is called isosceles
(the middle triangle in Fig. 1.1.7). When all sides are equal, a triangle is called
equilateral, (the right-hand triangle in Fig. 1.1.7). When all angles are equal, a
triangle is called equiangular.

Figure 1.1.7: [Def 1.21] The three types of triangles: scalene, isosceles, equilateral.

22. A right triangle is a triangle in which one of its angles is a right angle, such as
the middle triangle in Fig. 1.1.7. The side which stands opposite the right angle is
called the hypotenuse of the triangle. (In the middle triangle in Fig. 1.1.7, EDF
is a right angle, so side EF is the hypotenuse of the triangle.)

Notice that side EF of a triangle is not written as EF despite the fact that EF is
also a line segment; since EF is a side of a triangle, we may omit the overline.

                                         Figure 1.1.8: [Def. 1.23]

23. An obtuse triangle is a triangle such that one of its angles is obtuse (such as
CAB in CAB, Fig. 1.1.8).

24. An acute triangle is a triangle such that each of its angles are acute, such as
the left and right triangles in Fig. 1.1.7.

25. An exterior angle of a triangle is one which is formed by extending the side of a
triangle. In Fig. 1.1.8, CAB has had side BA extended to the segment BD which
creates the exterior angle DAC.

Every triangle has six exterior angles. Also, each exterior angle is the supplement
of the adjacent interior angle. In Fig. 1.1.8, the exterior angle DAC is the supple-
ment of the adjacent interior angle CAB.

The Polygon

26. A rectilinear figure bounded by three or more line segments can also be referred
to as a polygon (see definition 7). For example, a circle is a plane figure but not a
polygon, but the triangles in Fig. 1.1.8 are both plane figures and polygons.

27. A polygon is said to be convex when it does not have an interior angle greater
than 180.

28. A polygon of four sides is called a quadrilateral.

29. A lozenge19 is an equilateral parallelogram whose acute angles are 45 degrees.
Sometimes, the restriction to 45 degrees is dropped, and it is required only that two
opposite angles are acute and the other two obtuse. The term rhombus is commonly
used for an equilateral parallelogram20; see Fig. 1.1.9.

30. A rhombus which has a right angle is called a square.
31. A polygon which has five sides is called a pentagon; one which has six sides, a
hexagon, etc.21

The Circle

32. A circle is a plane figure constructed by connecting all points which are equally
distant from a center point. This center point is the center of the circle, and the
connected points become the circumference of the circle.

Figure 1.1.10: [Def. 1.32] C is constructed with center C and radius CD. Notice
that CA = CB = CD. Also notice that AB is a diameter.

33. A radius of a circle is any segment constructed from its center to its circumfer-
ence, such as CA, CB, or CD in Fig. 1.1.10. Notice that CA = CB = CD.
34. A diameter of a circle is a segment constructed through the center and termi-
nated at both ends by the circumference, such as AB in Fig. 1.1.10.

Other

35. A segment, line, or ray in any figure which divides the area of a regular or
symmetrical geometric object into two equal halves is called an Axis of Symmetry
of the figure (such as AC in the polygon ABCD, Fig. 1.1.11).

  21See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon

Alternatively, if an object is bisected by a segment (or line or ray) such that if for
each point on one side of the segment (or line or ray) there exists one point on the
other side of the segment (or line or ray) where the distance from each of these
points to the segment (or line or ray) is equal, then the segment (or line or ray) is
an Axis of Symmetry.

36. A segment constructed from any angle of a triangle to the midpoint of the
opposite side is called a median of the triangle. Each triangle has three medians
which are concurrent. The point of intersection of the three medians is called the
centroid of the triangle.

Figure 1.1.12: [Def. 1.36] CD is a median of ABC. The triangle has two other
medians not shown, and their intersection is the centroid of ABC.

37. A locus (plural: loci) is a set of points whose location satisfies or is determined
by one or more specified conditions, i.e., 1) every point satisfies a given condition,
and 2) every point satisfying it is in that particular locus.22 For example, a circle is
the locus of a point whose distance from the center is equal to its radius.
38. The circumcenter23 of a triangle is the point where the three perpendicular
bisectors of a triangle intersect.

39. The bisectors of the three internal angles of a triangle are concurrent, and their
point of intersection is called the incenter of the triangle.

Additional definitions will be introduced in [1.5] and subsequent chapters.

1.2 Postulates

We assume the following:

   1. A straight line, ray, or segment may be constructed from any one point to
       any other point. Lines, rays, and segments may be subdivided by points into
       segments or subsegments which are finite in length.

   2. A segment may be extended from any length to a longer segment, a ray, or a
       straight line.

   3. A circle may be constructed from any point (its center) and from any finite
       length measured from the center (its radius).

1.3 Axioms

1.3.1 Algebraic Axioms

Let a, b, c, etc., be real numbers. These axioms require four operations: addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Addition24 (often signified by the plus symbol "+") is one of the four basic opera-

tions of arithmetic, with the others being subtraction, multiplication and division.

The addition of two numbers which represent quantities gives us the sum, or to-

tal amount of those quantities combined. For example, if A = 34  radians and
B = 14  radians, then

                     (                                       )
A + B = 3  + 1  = 3 + 1  = 4  = 
                 44     44                                      4

radians.

Addition for quantities is defined when the quantities under consideration have the
same units. For example, a segment with a length of 3 units that is extended by
an additional 7 units now has side-length of 10 units; or 3 + 7 = 10 where each
number represents the number of units. However, if a segment with a length of 3 is
added to A = 34  radians, the sum is not defined. (In some cases, if the units are
removed and the now unit-less numbers are added together, their sum is defined,
but the sum may have no bearing on the context of the problem.)

Subtraction represents the operation of removing quantities from a collection of

quantities. It is signified by the minus sign (-). For example, if A = 34  radians
and B = 14  radians, then

                     (                                       )
A - B = 3  - 1  = 3 - 1  = 2  = 1 
                 44     44                                      42

Subtraction is a special case of addition where

                                      a + (-b) = a - b = c

The caveat above concerning units applies to subtraction.

Multiplication (often denoted by the cross symbol "×", by a point "·" or by the
absence of symbol): when thinking of multiplication as repeated addition, multi-
plication is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them (multiplicand) as
the value of the other one (multiplier). Normally the multiplier is written first
and multiplicand second, though this can vary and sometimes the distinction is not
meaningful. As one example,

                                          a×b = a+a+...+a

where the product a × b equals a added to itself a total of b times.

Multiplication is a special case of addition, and so the caveat above concerning
units applies to multiplication. The area of a certain geometric objects on the plane
(triangles, rectangles, parallelograms, etc.) can be defined by the product of two
lengths (base and height, two adjacent side-lengths, etc.). The volume of a certain
solid geometric objects (spheres, cubes, etc.) can also be defined by the product of
three lengths.

Division:  in  elementary    arithmetic,      division  (denoted   ÷    or  /  or  by  a  where  b  =   0)
                                                                                       b

is an arithmetic operation. Specifically, if b times c equals a, written:

                                           a=b×c

where b is not zero, then a divided by b equals c, written:

                             a÷b=c              a/b = c     a
                                                              =c

                                                            b

Division is a special case of multiplication where

                                           1             a
                                      a· b =a÷b= b

Hence, the caveat above concerning units applies to division.

Also,  b  divides  a  whenever  a  =  t·b  for  some  integer  t;  or,  a   =  tb  =   t  where  t  is  an
                                                                        b      b

integer. Note that if b divides a, then we also have that;

    1. b is a divisor of a
    2. a is a multiple of b

1.3.2 Congruence Axioms

In geometry, two figures or objects are congruent if they have the same shape and
size, or if one has the same shape and size as the mirror image of the other.26 More
formally, two objects are called congruent if and only if one can be transformed into
the other using only translations, rotations, or reflections. This means that either
object can be re-positioned and reflected (but not resized) so as to coincide precisely
with the other object. Therefore two distinct plane figures on a piece of paper are
congruent if we can cut them out and then match them up completely. Turning the
paper over is permitted.
Examples include:

    · Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length.

    · Two angles are congruent if they have the same measure.

    · Two circles are congruent if they have the same diameter or radius.

If a and b are congruent, we may write a = b. Three congruence properties with
examples:

   1. Reflexive Property: DE = DE and ABC = ABC.
   2. Symmetric Property: If DE = F G, then F G = DE. Also, if ABC = DEF ,

       then DEF = ABC.
   3. Transitive Property: If AB = CD and CD = EF , then AB = EF . Also, if

       ABC = DEF and DEF = GHI, then ABC = GHI.

The Algebraic and Congruence Axioms give us the Distributive Property:

                                             a(b + c) = ab + ac

1.3.3 Geometric Axioms

1. Any two objects which can be made to coincide are equal in measure.
The placing of one geometrical object on another, such as a line on a line, a triangle
on a triangle, or a circle on a circle, etc., is called superposition. The superposi-
tion employed in geometry is only mental; that is, we conceive of one object being
placed on the other. And then, if we can prove that the objects coincide, we infer
by the present axiom that they are equal in all respects, including magnitude. Su-
perposition involves the following principle which, without being explicitly stated,
Euclid uses frequently: "Any figure may be transferred from one position to another
without change in size or form."

2. Two straight lines on a plane cannot enclose a finite area.

3. All right angles are equal to each other.

                                              
4. If two lines (AB, CD) intersect a third line (AC) such that the sum of the two

interior angles (BAC + ACD) on the same side is less than the sum of two right
angles, then these lines meet at some finite distance. See Fig. 1.3.1.

                   
Figure 1.3.1: AB and CD must eventually meet (intersect) at some finite distance.

The above holds for rays and segments, mutatis mutandis.
Playfair's axiom27 can also be substituted for the above axiom, which states: "In
a plane, given a line and a point not on it, at most one line parallel to the given
line can be drawn through the point." This axiom was named after the Scottish
mathematician John Playfair. His "at most" clause is all that is needed since it can
be proven through Euclid's propositions that at least one parallel line exists. This
axiom is often written with the phrase, "there is one and only one parallel line".
Axioms which are equivalent to axiom 4 include:

    · The sum of the angles in every triangle is 180° (triangle postulate).

    · Every triangle can be circumscribed.

    · There exists a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles (that is, a
       rectangle).

    · There exists a pair of straight lines that are at constant distance from each
       other.

  27https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair's_axiom
32  CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

    · Two lines that are parallel to the same line are also parallel to each other.
    · There is no upper limit to the area of a triangle. (Wallis axiom)28.

Proposition 1.1. CONSTRUCTING AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE.

Given an arbitrary segment, it is possible to construct an equilateral triangle on
that segment.

Proof. Suppose we are given segment AB; we claim that an equilateral triangle
can be constructed on AB.
With A as the center of a circle and AB as its radius, we construct the circle A
[Postulate 3 from section 1.2]. With B as center and AB as radius, we construct the
circle B, intersecting A at point C.
Construct segments CA, CB [Postulate 1 from section 1.2]. We claim that ABC
is the required equilateral triangle.

                                             Figure 1.4.1: [1.1]

Because A is the center of the circle A, AC = AB [Def. 1.33]. Since B is the center
of the circle B, AB = BC. By Axiom 9 from section 1.3.1 (using equalities), we
have AC = AB = BC.
Since these line segments are the sides of ABC, ABC is an equilateral triangle
[Def. 1.21]. Since ABC is constructed on segment AB, we have proven our claim.

Remark. [1.1]-[1.3] are lemmas to [1.4].

Remark. This proposition may seem strange to readers who are familiar with mod-
ern mathematical proofs. Proofs from the 21st century usually show that some non-
tangible, mathematical object either does or does not exist, while [1.1] describes
how to construct an object and then proves that this object is what we intended to
construct.
The mathematics of Euclid's day was akin to engineering and construction. If you
could prove something existed but not use that knowledge to help construct an
object in the real world, you were on track to becoming a full-time ptochos29.

Proposition 1.2. CONSTRUCTING A LINE SEGMENT EQUAL IN LENGTH
TO AN ARBITRARY LINE SEGMENT.

Given an arbitrary point and an arbitrary segment, it is possible to construct a
segment with:

   (1) one endpoint being the previously given point
   (2) a length equal to that of the arbitrary segment.

Proof. Let A be an arbitrary point on the plane, and let BC be an arbitrary seg-
ment. Our claim is stated above.

Construct AB, and on AB construct the equilateral triangle ABD [1.1].
With B as the center and BC as the radius, construct B. Extend DB to intersect
the circle B at E [Postulate 2 from section 1.2]. With D as the center and DE as
radius, construct D. Extend DA to meet D at F .

                                 Figure 1.4.3: [1.2] fully constructed

Proof. Clearly, AF has A as one of its endpoints (claim 1). If we can show that
AF = BC, we will have proven our claim.
36  CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

Since DE and DF are radii of D, DF = DE [Def. 1.32]. Because DAB is an
equilateral triangle, DA = DB [Def. 1.21]. By [Axiom 2 from section 1.3.1], we find
that

                                          DF - DA = DE - DB

But DF - DA = AF and DE - DB = BE. By [Axiom 5 from section 1.3.1], we find
that AF = BE.

Since BC and BE are radii at B, BE = BC. By Axiom 9 from section 1.3.1 (using
equalities), we have AF = BC (claim 2), which completes the proof.

Given two arbitrary, unequal segments, it is possible to subdivide the larger seg-

ment.

Proof. Construct segments AB and CG such that CG < AB. We claim that AB
may be subdivided into segments AE and EB where AE = CG.

From A, construct AD such that AD = CG [1.2]. With A as the center and AD as
radius, construct A [Postulate 1.3] which intersects AB at E.

                                             Figure 1.4.4: [1.3]

Because A is the center of A, AE = AD [Def. 1.32]. Since AD = CG by construc-
tion, by Axiom 9 from section 1.3.1 (using equalities), AE = CG, which proves our
claim.

Proposition 1.4. THE "SIDE-ANGLE-SIDE" THEOREM FOR THE CONGRU-
ENCE OF TRIANGLES.

If two pairs of sides in two triangles is respectively equal in length, and if the cor-
responding interior angles are equal in measure, then the triangles are congruent.

Proof. If ABC and DEF exist such that AB = DE, AC = DF , and BAC =
EDF , then ABC = DEF .

                                             Figure 1.4.5: [1.4]

Recall that superposition allows us to move one object top of another without dis-
torting its shape or measure. If ABC is positioned30 on DEF such that the
point A is positioned on the point D and side AB is positioned on side DE, then the
point B coincides with the point E because AB = DE.
Since AB coincides with DE, the side AC also coincides with side DF because
BAC = EDF . Since AC = DF , C coincides with F .
Because B coincides with E, the base BC of ABC coincides with the base EF of
DEF ; it follows that BC = EF .
Hence all sides and angles of one triangle are equal with their corresponding sides
and angles in the other triangle. We conclude that ABC = DEF .

Remark. Euclid's Elements contains three propositions on the congruence of trian-
gles: [1.4] side-angle-side (SAS), [1.8] side-side-side (SSS), and [1.26] angle-angle-
side (AAS or SAA) and angle-side-angle (ASA).

Exam questions.
1. What is meant by superposition?
2. How many parts make up a triangle? (Ans. 6, three sides and three angles.)
3. When it is required to prove that two triangles are congruent, how many parts of
one must be given equal to the corresponding parts of the other? (Ans. In general,

Proposition 1.5. ISOSCELES TRIANGLES I.

If a triangle is isosceles, then:
   (1) if the sides of the triangle other than the base are extended, the angles under

the base are equal in measure
   (2) the angles at the base are equal in measure.

Proof. Construct ABC such that sides AB = AC and denote side BC as the tri-
angle's base. Extend AB to AD and AC to AE such that CE  BD. We claim
that:

   (1) DBC = ECB
   (2) ABC = ACB
We will prove each claim separately. Claim 1: DBC = ECB
Let F be a point on BD other than B or D. On CE, choose point G such that
CG = BF [1.3]. (Since CE  BD, such a point exists and is not an endpoint.)
Construct BG and CF [two applications of Postulate 1 from section 1.2].

                                             Figure 1.4.6: [1.5]

Because AF = AG by construction and AB = AC by hypothesis, it follows that
sides AF and AC in F AC are respectively equal in length to sides AG and AB
in GAB. Also, the angle BAC is the interior angle to both pairs of sides in
each triangle. By [1.4], F AC = GAB; this implies that AF C = AGB and
BG = CF.
Consider F BC, GCB: since BF = CG, CF = BG, and AF C = AGB, by [1.4]
F BC = GCB. This implies that F BC = GCB, which are the angles under
the base of ABC; or,

                                DBC = F BC = GCB = ECB

This proves claim 1.
1.4. BOOK I, PROPOSITIONS 1-26                                                 41

Claim 2: ABC = ACB

Since F BC = GCB, we have F CB = GBC. By the above31, F CA = GBA.
Notice that:

             F CA = GBA
F CB + ACB = GBC + ABC
F CB + ACB = F CB + ABC

             ACB = ABC

This proves claim 2 and completes the proof.

Remark. The difficulty which beginners may have with this proposition is due to
the fact that ACF , ABG overlap. A teacher or tutor should graph these trian-
gles separately and point out the corresponding parts: AF = AG, AC = AB, and
F AC = GAB. By [1.4], it follows that ACF = ABG, AF C = AGB.

Corollary. 1.5.1. A triangle is equilateral if and only if it is equiangular.

Proposition 1.6. ISOSCELES TRIANGLES II.

If a given triangle has two equal angles, then the sides opposite the two angles are
equal in length (i.e., the triangle is isosceles).

Proof. Construct ABC such that ABC = ACB. In order to prove our claim
that AB = AC, we will use a proof by contradiction32 33.

                                             Figure 1.4.7: [1.6]

Without loss of generality34, suppose side AB > AC. On AB, construct a point D
such that BD = CA [1.3] and construct CD. Notice that ACD > 0 (i.e., the area
of ACD is greater than 0); otherwise, we would not have ACD.

Consider DBC and ACB: since DB = AC, DBC = ACB, and each triangle
contains the side BC, by [1.4] DBC = ACB. It follows that ACB = DBC.

But ACB = ACD  DBC, and so it follows that ACD = 0 (i.e., the area
of ACD equals 0). But above we showed that ACD > 0. By showing that
ACD = 0 and ACD > 0, we obtain a contradiction.

Specifically, we assumed that AB > AC and obtained a contradiction. If we instead
assume that AC > AB, we would obtain the same contradiction (this is what we
mean by "without loss of generality"; we had two ways to begin the proof, and
either way would have obtained the same result). Since AB > AC and AC > AB
each produce a contradiction, we must have AB = AC, which proves our claim.

Corollary. 1.6.1. Together, [1.5] and [1.6] state that a triangle is isosceles if and
only if35 the angles at its base are equal.

  32Mathematics rigidly follows the laws of Western logic, which means that contradictions are always a
sign of error. If we attempt to prove a proposition and obtain a contradiction, then, because a proposition
is either true or false, the proposition must be false.

  See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction
  33This proof by contradiction will show that the statement "A triangle with two equal angles has
unequal opposite sides" is false.
  See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction
  34This term is used before an assumption in a proof which narrows the premise to some special case;
it is implied that either the proof for that case can be easily applied to all others or that all other cases
are equivalent. Thus, given a proof of the conclusion in the special case, it is trivial to adapt it to prove
the conclusion in all other cases. It is usually abbreviated as wlog.

Proposition 1.7. DISTINCT TRIANGLES.

If we construct two distinct triangles such that two sides are equal in length, then
the third side of each triangle will be unequal in length.

Proof. Construct distinct triangles ADB, ACB which share the base AB. Sup-
pose that AC = AD. We claim that BC = BD.

                                        Figure 1.4.8: [1.7], case 1

The vertex of the second triangle may be either within or outside the first triangle.

Case 1: Vertex outside of the other triangle.

Let the vertex of each triangle lie outside the interior of the other triangle (i.e., D
does not lie inside ACB and C does not lie inside ADB). Construct CD. Because
AD = AC by hypothesis, ACD is isosceles. By [Cor. 1.6.1], ACD = ADC.
Since ADC = ADB + BDC and ADB > 0, it follows that ADC > BDC
[1.3.1 Axiom 12]. Because ACD = ADC, we also have that ACD > BDC.
Since BCD = BCA + ACD, we also have that BCD > BDC.
Consider BDC. Since BCD > BDC, by [Cor. 1.6.1] we find that BD = BC,
which proves our claim.

Case 2: Vertex inside the other triangle.

Wlog, let the vertex of the triangle ADB be located within the interior of ACB.
Extend side AC to segment AE and side AD to segment AF . Construct CD. Be-
cause AC = AD by hypothesis, the triangle ACD is isosceles; by [1.5] ECD =
F DC.

                                        Figure 1.4.9: [1.7], case 2

Since ECD = ECB + BCD, it follows that ECD > BCD [1.3.1 Axiom 12].
Because ECD = F DC, we also have that F DC > BCD. Since BDC =
BDF + F DC, we find that BDC > BCD.
Consider BDC. Since BDC > BCD, by [Cor. 1.6.1] we find that BD = BC,
which proves our claim and completes the proof.

Corollary. 1.7.1. Two triangles are distinct whenever no side of one triangle is
equal in length to any side of the other triangle.

Proposition 1.8. THE "SIDE-SIDE-SIDE" THEOREM FOR THE CONGRUENCE
OF TRIANGLES.

If all three pairs of sides of two triangles are respectively equal in length, then the
triangles are congruent.

Proof. Suppose ABC and DEF are triangles where sides AB = DE, AC = DF ,
and BC = EF (where BC and EF are the bases of those triangles). We claim that
ABC = DEF .

                                            Figure 1.4.10: [1.8]

Let ABC be positioned on DEF such that point B coincides with point E and
the side BC coincides with the side EF . Because BC = EF , the point C coincides
with point F . If the vertex A falls on the same side of EF as vertex D, then the
point A must coincide with D.
If this were not true, then A must have a different location: call this point G. Our
hypothesis then states EG = AB and AB = ED. By [1.3.1 Axiom 8], EG = ED.
Similarly, F G = F D. However, by [1.7], F G = F D, a contradiction.
Hence the point A must coincide with point D, and so the three angles of one tri-
angle are respectively equal to the three angles of the other (specifically, ABC =
DEF , BAC = EDF , and BCA = EF D). Therefore, ABC = DEF .

Proposition 1.9. BISECTING A RECTILINEAR ANGLE.

It is possible to bisect an angle.

                                    --                    -
Proof. Construct BAC, point D on AB, and point E on AC such that AE = AD

[1.3]. Construct DE; also construct the equilateral triangle DEF [1.1] such that

F stands on the other side of DE than A. Construct AF . We claim that AF bisects

B AC .

                                    Figure 1.4.11: [1.9]

Consider DAF , EAF : each shares AF , AD = AE by construction, and DF =
EF by construction. By [1.8], DAF = EAF , and so DAF = EAF . Notice
that

            BAC =                       DAF + EAF
                          =             2 · DAF

                        =               DAF
        1 · BAC =
        2

Or, BAC is bisected by AF , which completes the proof.

                                                          
Corollary. 1.9.1. If AF is extended to the line AF , then AF is the Axis of Symmetry

of the AED, DEF , figure BDAEC, and segment DE.

ments of appropriate length with point A as the vertex, mutatis mutandis.

Proposition 1.10. BISECTING A SEGMENT.

It is possible to bisect a segment of arbitrary length (i.e., it is possible to locate the
midpoint of a segment).

Proof. Construct AB; we claim that the segment AB can be bisected.

                                           Figure 1.4.12: [1.10]

Construct the equilateral triangle ABC with AB as its base [1.1]. Bisect ACB
by constructing the segment CD [1.9] which intersects AB at D. Clearly, AB =
AD  DB. We claim that AB = 2 · AD = 2 · DB (which is equivalent to stating that
AB is bisected at D).
Consider ACD, BCD: AC = BC (since each are sides of the equilateral triangle
ACB); each triangle shares side CD; ACD = BCD by construction. By [1.4],
ACD = BCD, and so AD = DB. Therefore,

                                 AB = AD + DB = 2 · AD = 2 · DB

which proves our claim.

Proposition 1.11. CONSTRUCTING A PERPENDICULAR SEGMENT I.

It is possible to construct a segment at a right angle to a given line from any point
on the line.

Proof. Construct AB containing point C. On CA, choose any point D; on CB, choose

E such that CE = CD [1.3]. Construct the equilateral triangle DF E on DE [1.1]
                                              

and construct CF . We claim that AB  CF .

                                           Figure 1.4.13: [1.11]

Consider DCF , ECF : each shares side CF , CD = CE by construction, and
DF = EF since DF E is equilateral. By [1.8] DCF = ECF , and so DCF =
ECF . Since these are adjacent angles, [Def. 1.13] states that each of these angles
is a right angle, which proves our claim.

Corollary. 1.11.1. [1.11] holds when AB is a segment or ray and/or when CF is a
straight line or a ray, mutatis mutandis.

Proposition 1.12. CONSTRUCTING A PERPENDICULAR SEGMENT II.

Given an arbitrary line and an arbitrary point not on the line, we may construct a
perpendicular segment from the point to the line.

                                  
Proof. Construct AB and C such that C is not on AB. We wish to construct CH
  
such that H is on AB and CH  AB.

Bisect F G at H [1.10] and construct CH [Postulate 1.1]. We claim that CH  AB.
Construct CF G, and consider F HC and GHC: F H = GH by construction;
the triangles share HC; CF = CG since each are radii of C [Def. 1.32]. By [1.8],
F HC = GHC, and so CHF = CHG. Since these are adjacent angles, [Def.
1.13] states that each angle is a right angle, which proves our claim.

Proposition 1.13. ANGLES AT INTERSECTIONS OF STRAIGHT LINES.

If a line intersects another line, the lines either stand at right angles or at two
angles whose sum equals two right angles.

      
Proof. If the line AB intersects the line CD at B, we claim that either ABC and

ABD are right angles or that ABC + ABD equals two right angles.

                           Figure 1.4.15: [1.13] () on left, () on right

    
If AB  CD as in Fig. 1.4.15(), then ABC and ABD are right angles.
Otherwise, ABC and ABD are not right angles as in Fig. 1.4.15(); construct
 
BE  CD [1.11]. Notice that ABC = CBE + EBA [Def. 1.11]. Adding ABD
to each side of this equality, we obtain that

                          ABC + ABD = CBE + EBA + ABD

Similarly, we find that
                          CBE + EBA + ABD = CBE + EBD

By [1.3.1 Axiom 8], we find that
                                 ABC + ABD = CBE + EBD

Since CBE and EBD are right angles, ABC + ABD equals the sum of two
right angles, which proves our claim.

Proof. Denote EBA by . Notice that:

                                  CBA = right angle +

Proposition 1.14. RAYS TO STRAIGHT LINES.

If at the endpoint of a ray there exists two other rays constructed on opposite sides
of the first ray such that the sum of their adjacent angles is equal to two right
angles, then these two rays form one line.

    --                           --             -- --
Proof. Construct BA. On opposite sides of BA, construct BC and BD such that the

sum of their adjacent angles, CBA + ABD, equals two right angles. We claim
      -- -- 

that BC  BD = CD.

                         Figure 1.4.16: [1.14]

                         -- --                        
Suppose instead that BC  BE = CE and EBD > 0. Since CE is a line and
--
BA stands on it, the sum CBA + ABE equals two right angles [1.13]. Also by

hypothesis, the sum CBA + ABD equals two right angles. Therefore,

                         CBA + ABE = CBA + ABD
                                     ABE = ABD
                                     ABE = ABE + EBD

Proposition 1.15. OPPOSITE ANGLES ARE EQUAL.

If two lines intersect at a point, then their opposite angles are equal.

            
Proof. Suppose AB and CD intersect at E. We claim that AEC = DEB and

BEC = DEA.

              Figure 1.4.17: [1.15]

            
Because AB intersects CD at E, the sum DEA + AEC equals two right angles
                                     
[1.13]. Similarly, because CD intersects AB at E, the sum AEC + BEC also

equals two right angles. Therefore,

            AEC + DEA = AEC + BEC
                        DEA = BEC

Similarly, we can also show that AEC = DEB, which proves our claim.

An alternate proof:
Proof. Because opposite angles share a common supplement, they are equal.

Proposition 1.16. THE EXTERIOR ANGLE OF A TRIANGLE IS GREATER
THAN EITHER OF THE NON-ADJACENT INTERIOR ANGLES.

If any side of a triangle is extended, the resulting exterior angle is greater than
either of the non-adjacent interior angles.

Proof. Construct ABC. Wlog, we extend side BC to BD. We claim that the exte-

rior angle ACD is greater than either of the interior non-adjacent angles ABC,
B AC .

                                           Figure 1.4.18: [1.16]

Bisect AC at E [1.10] and construct BE [Postulate 1.1]. Extend BE to BF such
that BE = EF [1.3]. Also construct CF .
Consider CEF and AEB: CE = EA by construction, BE = EF by construction,
and CEF = AEB [1.15]. By [1.4], CEF = AEB, and so ECF = EAB.
Since ACD = ECF + F CD and EAB = BAC,

                          ACD = EAB + F CD = BAC + F CD
It follows that ACD > BAC.
Similarly, if BC is bisected, it can be shown that ACD > ABC, which completes
the proof.

Proposition 1.17. THE SUM OF TWO INTERIOR ANGLES OF A TRIANGLE.

The sum of two interior angles of a triangle is less than the sum of two right angles.

Proof. We claim that the sum of any two interior angles of ABC is less than the
sum of two right angles.

                                           Figure 1.4.19: [1.17]

Wlog, choose ABC and BAC and extend side BC to BD. By [1.16], ACD >
ABC. To each, add the angle ACB:

                               ACD + ACB > ABC + ACB

By [1.13], ACD +ACB equals two right angles; therefore, ABC +ACB is less
than two right angles.
Similarly, we can show that the sums ABC + BAC and ACB + BAC are
each less than two right angles, mutatis mutandis. A similar argument follows on
EF G, which proves our claim.

Proposition 1.18. ANGLES AND SIDES IN A TRIANGLE I.

If one side of a triangle is longer than another side, then the angle opposite the
longer side is greater in measure than the angle opposite the shorter side.

Proof. Construct ABC with sides AB and AC where AC > AB. We claim that the

angle opposite AC is greater in measure than the angle opposite AB; or, ABC >
AC B .

                                           Figure 1.4.20: [1.18]

On AC, find D such that AD = AB [1.3], and construct BD; notice that ABD is
isosceles. By [1.6], ADB = ABD. Since ADB > ACB by [1.16], ABD >
ACB. Since ABC = ABD + CBD, we also have that ABC > ACB, which
proves our claim.

1. Prove that if two of the opposite sides of a quadrilateral are respectively the
greatest and the least sides of the quadrilateral, then the angles adjacent to the

Proposition 1.19. ANGLES AND SIDES IN A TRIANGLE II.
In a triangle, if one angle is greater in measure than another, then the side opposite
the greater angle is longer than the side opposite the shorter angle.

Proof. Construct ABC where ABC > ACB. We claim that AC > AB.

                                           Figure 1.4.21: [1.19]

If AC > AB, then either AC = AB or AC < AB.
1. If AC = AB, ACB is isosceles and ACB = ABC [Cor. 1.6.1]. This contra-
dicts our hypothesis that ABC > ACB, and so AC = AB.
2. If AC < AB, we find that ACB > ABC [1.18]. This also contradicts our
hypothesis that ABC > ACB, and so AC < AB.
Since AC  AB, we must have that AC > AB.

Corollary. 1.19.1. In a triangle, longer sides stand opposite the greater interior
angles and shorter interior angles stand opposite the shorter sides.

1. Prove this proposition by a direct demonstration.

Proposition 1.20. THE SUM OF THE LENGTHS OF ANY PAIR OF SIDES OF
A TRIANGLE.

In a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any pair of sides is greater than the length
of the remaining side.

Proof. Construct ABC; wlog, we claim that AB + AC > BC.

                                           Figure 1.4.22: [3.20]

Extend BA to BD such that AD = AC [1.3], and construct CD.
Consider ACD: by construction AD = AC, and so ACD = ADC [1.5]. Since
BCD = BCA + ACD, BCD > ACD = ADC = BDC. By [1.19], BD >
BC.
Notice that

                                                AD = AC
                                        BA + AD = BA + AC

                                                BD = BA + AC

and so BA + AC > BC, which proves our claim.

Alternatively:

Proof. Construct ABC; wlog, we claim that AB + AC > BC. Bisect BAC by
constructing AE [1.9]. Then BEA > EAC = EAB. It follows that BA > BE
[1.19]. Similarly, AC > EC. It follows that

                                      BA + AC > BE + EC = BC

which proves our claim.

Proposition 1.21. TRIANGLES WITHIN TRIANGLES.

In an arbitrary triangle, if two segments are constructed from the vertexes of its
base to a point within the triangle, then:

   (1) the sum of the lengths of these inner sides will be less than the sum of the
outer sides (excluding the base);

   (2) these inner sides will contain a greater angle than the corresponding sides of
the outer triangle.

Proof. Construct ABC with base BC, and construct D within ABC. Finally,
construct segments BD, CD. We claim that:

   1. BA + AC > BD + DC
   2. BDC > BAC

                                           Figure 1.4.23: [3.21]

Claim 1: BA + AC > BD + DC.
Extend BD to BE where E is on AC. In BAE, we find that BA + AE > BE [1.20].
It follows that:

                             BA + AC = BA + AE + EC > BE + EC

Similarly, in DEC, we find that DE + EC > DC, from which it follows that
                            BE + EC = BD + DE + EC > BD + DC

From these two inequalities, we obtain that BA + AC > BD + DC, which proves
claim 1.
Claim 2: BDC > BAC.
By [1.16], we find that BDC > BEC. Similarly, BEC > BAE. It follows that
BDC > BAE = BAC, which proves claim 2 and completes the proof.

An alternative proof of claim 2 that does not extend sides BD and DC:

Proof. Construct ABC and BDC as above. Also construct AD and extending it
to intersect BC at F . Consider BDA and CDA. By [1.16], BDF > BAF and
F DC > F AC. Then

                   BDC = BDF + F DC > BAF + F AC = BAC

which completes the proof.

Proposition 1.22. CONSTRUCTION OF TRIANGLES FROM ARBITRARY SEG-
MENTS.

It is possible to construct a triangle whose sides are respectively equal in length to
three arbitrary segments whenever the sum of the lengths of each pair of segments
is greater than the length of the remaining segment.

Proof. Let AR, BS, and CT be arbitrary segments which satisfy our hypothesis.

Construct DE such that it contains the segments DF = AR, F G = BS, and

1.2, Postulate 3]. With G as the center and GH as radius, construct G where K is
one intersection between F and G. Construct KF , KG. We claim that KF G
is the required triangle.
Since F is the center of F , F K = F D. Since F D = AR by construction, F K = AR.
Also by construction, F G = BS and KG = CT . Therefore, the three sides of the
triangle KF G are respectively equal to the three segments AR, BS, and CT ,
which proves our claim.

Proposition 1.24. ANGLES AND SIDES IN A TRIANGLE III.

Suppose we have two triangles such that two sides of the first triangle are respec-
tively equal in length to two sides of the second triangle and that the interior angles
of each of these pairs of sides are unequal. The third side of the triangle with the
larger interior angle will be longer than the third side of the triangle with the
smaller interior angle.

Proof. Construct two triangles ABC and DEF where AB = DE, AC = DF ,
and BAC > EDF . We claim that BC > EF .

                                           Figure 1.4.28: [1.24]

Construct point G on BC such that BAG = EDF . Wlog, suppose that AB < AC;
by [1.19, #5] we find that AG < AC. Extend AG to AH where AH = DF = AC
[1.3].

Construct BH and CH. In triangles BAH and EDF , we have AB = DE, AH =
DF , and BAH = EDF by construction. By [1.4], BAH = EDF , and so
BH = EF.

Notice that ACH > BCH since ACH = BCH + BCA. Because AH = AC
by construction, ACH is isosceles; therefore, ACH = AHC [1.5]. It follows
that AHC > BCH. And since BHC = BHA + AHC, we also have that
BHC > BCH.
By [1.19], BC > BH. Since BH = EF by the above, BC > EF , which proves our
claim.

Alternatively, the concluding part of this proposition may be proved without con-
structing CH.
1.4. BOOK I, PROPOSITIONS 1-26                                    69

Proof. Assume the hypotheses and construct the triangles as in the previous proof;
we claim that this proof does not require CH.

Notice that

                     BG + GH > BH                   [1.20] and
                      AG + GC > AC                  [1.20] 
(BG + GH) + (AG + GC) > BH + AC
(BG + GC) + (AG + GH) > BH + AC                                 
                     BC + AH > BH + AC                          

Since AH = AC and BH = EF by construction, we have

                         BC + AC > EF + AC
                                 BC > EF

which proves our claim.

Another alternative:

                                                                
Proof. In ABC, bisect the angle CAH by AO. In CAO and HAO we have
the sides CA, AO in one triangle respectively equal to the sides AH, AO in the
other where the interior angles are equal. By [1.4], OC = OH. It follows that
BO + OH = BO + OC = BC. But BO + OH > BH [1.20], and so BC > BH. Since
BH = EF , BC > EF , which proves our claim.

Remark. The reader will have noticed by now that the number of explicit references
to definitions, axioms, and theorems has dwindled since the first proposition. This
is normal in mathematical writing even though it is sub-optimal to the reader.
Such practice is normal because to do otherwise would place an impossible burden
on the writer. One reader will wish I had cited the Inequality Properties of Addition
and Subtraction in the above. Another would be insulted if I had halted the proof
to cite something so obvious.36 Yet another reader will ask why the Inequality
Properties of Addition and Subtraction was assumed rather than proven.37 No
writer can satisfy contradictory demands. The best way out for the author is to
discard whatever he or she finds obvious and to leave the detective work to the
reader.

1. Prove this proposition by constructing the angle ABH to the left of AB.

  36Exactly what is and is not obvious in mathematics is a can of worms I do not intend to open here.
  37The questions regarding the foundations of mathematics are not as simple as one might think.
Whitehead & Russell's "Principia Mathematica" is so detailed that the authors take well over 300 pages
to prove that 1 + 1 = 2.

Proposition 1.25. ANGLES AND SIDES IN A TRIANGLE IV.

Suppose two triangles exist such that two sides of the first triangle are respectively
equal in length to two sides of the second triangle and the third sides are unequal
in length. The triangle with the longer third side will have a larger interior angle
than the triangle with the shorter side.

Proof. Construct ABC and DEF such that AB = DE, AC = DF , and BC >
EF . We claim that BAC > EDF .

                                           Figure 1.4.29: [1.25]

Suppose instead that BAC = EDF ; since AB = DE and AC = DF by construc-
tion, by [1.4] ABC = DEF , and so BC = EF . This contradicts our hypothesis
that BC > EF ; hence, BAC = EDF .
Now suppose that BAC < EDF ; since AB = DE and AC = DF , by [1.24]
we find that EF > BC. This contradicts our hypothesis that BC > EF ; hence,
BAC  EDF .
Since BAC  EDF , BAC > EDF , which proves our claim.

Proposition 1.26. CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES WITH ONE EQUAL SIDE
AND TWO EQUAL INTERIOR ANGLES.

If two triangles exist such that one side of the first triangle is equal in length to
one side of the second triangle and that two interior angles of the first triangle are
respectively equal in measure to two interior angles of the second triangle, then the
triangles are congruent. Most express this proposition as two theorems:

1. "ANGLE-SIDE-ANGLE" CONGRUENCE. If the equal side stands between the
two equal angles, then the triangles are congruent.

2. "ANGLE-ANGLE-SIDE" CONGRUENCE. If the equal side does not stand be-
tween the two equal angles, then the triangles are congruent.

We will prove this proposition in two cases.

Proof. Construct ABC and DEF such that ABC = DEF and ACB =

EF D. We claim that if one side of ABC is equal in length to its respective
side in DEF , then ABC = DEF .

                                      Figure 1.4.30: [1.26], case 1

Case 1. ANGLE-SIDE-ANGLE
Suppose that BC = EF . If AB = DE, suppose that AB = GE where G is a point
on DE such that D = G. Construct GF , and notice that GF D > 0. (If GF D = 0,
then D = G, a contradiction.)
Consider ABC and GEF : AB = GE, BC = EF , and ABC = GEF . By [1.4],
ABC = GEF , and so ACB = GF E. Since ACB = DF E by hypothesis,
we find that GF E = DF E and GF E + GF D = DF E; hence GF D = 0 and
GF D > 0, a contradiction. Therefore, AB = DE.
Since AB = DE, BC = EF , and ABC = DEF , by [1.4] ABC = DEF .

Case 2. ANGLE-ANGLE-SIDE
Now suppose that AB = DE.
72  CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

                                      Figure 1.4.31: [1.26], case 2

If BC = EF , suppose that EF = BG where G is a point on BC such that C =
G. Construct AG, and consider ABG and DEF : AB = DE, BG = EF , and
ABG = DEF . By [1.4], ABG = DEF , and so AGB = DF E. Since
ACB = DF E by hypothesis, AGB = ACB; that is, the exterior angle of
ACG is equal to an interior and non-adjacent angle, contradicting [1.16]. Thus
BC = EF.
Since AB = DE, BC = EF , and ABC = DEF , by [1.4] ABC = DEF .
This proves both claims and completes proof.

Proposition 1.27. PARALLEL LINES I.

If a line intersects a pair of lines and their alternate angles are equal, then the pair
of lines are parallel.

              
Proof. Let EF intersect AB and CD such that AEF = EF D. We claim that
 
AB  CD.

If AB  CD, then AB and CD intersect at point G where the length of BG is finite.

It follows that EGF is a triangle where AEF is an exterior angle and EF G a
non-adjacent interior angle. By [1.16], AEF > EF D; but AEF = EF D by

Suppose a line intersects a pair of lines.

its corresponding interior angle, then the pair of lines is parallel.

2) PARALLEL LINES III. If the intersecting line makes the sum of two interior
angles on the same side equal to two right angles, then the pair of lines is parallel.

       
Proof. Suppose EF intersects AB and CD.

Claim 1: If EGB = GHD, we claim that AB  CD.

         
Since AB, EF intersect at G, AGH = EGB [1.15]. By hypothesis, AGH =

                                                              
GHD. Since these are alternate angles, AB  CD by [1.27], which proves our
claim.

                                                                                               
Claim 2: If BGH + GHD equals two right angles, we claim that AB  CD.
Since AGH and BGH are adjacent angles, by [1.13] the sum AGH + BGH
equals two right angles. Since BGH = BGH,

                              BGH + GHD = BGH + AGH
                                           GHD = AGH

                                                                    
Since GHD and AGH are alternate angles, AB  CD by [1.27], which proves
our claim and completes the proof.

Proposition 1.29. PARALLEL LINES IV.

If a line intersects two parallel lines, then:
   (1) corresponding alternate angles are equal,
   (2) exterior angles are equal to corresponding interior angles,
   (3) the sum of interior angles on the same side equals two right angles.

                                     
Proof. If EF intersects AB and CD where AB  CD, we claim that:

   (1) AGH = GHD (BGH = GHC, mutatis mutandis);

   (2) EGB = GHD (EGA = GHC, mutatis mutandis);

   (3) GHD + HGB equals two right angles (AGH + GHC also equals two
right angles, mutatis mutandis)

Claim 1: if AGH = GHD, one angle must be greater than the other. Wlog,
suppose that AGH > GHD. Then we obtain the inequality

    AGH + BGH > GHD + BGH

where AGH + BGH is equal to the sum of two right angles by [1.13]. It follows
                                                                             
that GHD + BGH is less than two right angles. By the proof of [1.27], AB and
                                                                 
CD meet at some finite distance; this contradicts our hypothesis that AB  CD.

Hence, AGH = GHD, proving claim 1.

Claim 2: since EGB = AGH by [1.15] and AGH = GHD by claim 1, EGB =
GHD, proving claim 2.

Claim 3. since AGH = GHD by claim 1,
                                AGH + HGB = GHD + HGB

Since AGH + HGB equals the sum of two right angles, GHD + HGB equals
the sum of two right angles. This proves claim 3 and completes the proof.

If a line intersects a pair of lines, then the pair of lines are parallel if and only if any
of these three properties hold:

1) corresponding alternate angles are equal;

2) exterior angles equal their corresponding interior angles;

3) the sum of the interior angles on the same side are equal to two right angles.

Corollary. 1.29.2. We may replace the lines in [1.29, Cor. 1] with segments of
appropriate length or rays, mutatis mutandis.

      Figure 1.5.5: [1.28] and [1.29]

Exercises.

Remark. We may use [1.31] in the proofs of these exercises since the proof of [1.31]
does not require [1.29].

1. Demonstrate both parts of [1.28] without using [1.27].

      
2. Construct AB containing the point C and EF containing the point D such that
 
AB  EF . Construct CH and CJ such that CJ bisects ACD and CH bisects

BCD. Prove that DH = DJ. [See the final chapter for a solution.]

4. If any other secant is constructed through the midpoint O of any line terminated
by two parallel lines, the intercept on this line made by the parallels is bisected at
O.

5. Two lines passing through a point which is equidistant from two parallel lines
intercept equal segments on the parallels. [See the final chapter for a solution.]

6. Construct the perimeter of the parallelogram formed by constructing parallels to
two sides of an equilateral triangle from any point in the third side. This perimeter
is equal to 2× the side.

7. If the opposite sides of a hexagon are equal and parallel, prove that its diagonals
are concurrent.

8. If two intersecting segments are respectively parallel to two others, the angle
                                                              
between the former is equal to the angle between the latter. (Hint: if AB, AC are
                                  
respectively parallel to DE, DF and if AC, DE intersect at G, then the angles at

points A, D are each equal to the angle at G [1.29].)

Proposition 1.30. TRANSITIVITY OF PARALLEL LINES.

Lines parallel to the same line are parallel to each other.

                                                  
Proof. Construct lines AB, CD, EF such that AB  EF and CD  EF . We claim
 
that AB  CD.

                 Figure 1.5.6: [1.30]

                 --               
Construct any secant line GHK. Since AB  EF , the angle AGH = GHF [Cor.
               
1.29.1]. Since CD  EF , the angle GHF = HKD [Cor. 1.29.1]. It follows

that AGH = GHF = HKD. Since AGH = AGK and HKD = GKD,
                                        

AGK = GKD. By [1.27], AB  CD.

                                 
Corollary. 1.30.1. AB, CD, EF , and GK in [1.30] may be replaced by segments of

appropriate length or rays, mutatis mutandis.

Proposition 1.31. CONSTRUCTION OF A PARALLEL LINE.

We wish to construct a line which is parallel to a given line and passing through a
given point.

                                                    
Proof. Given the line AB and a point C, we wish to construct the line CE such that
 
CE  AB.

              Figure 1.5.7: [1.31]

                                                         
Using [1.23], construct D on AB and E not on AB such that, after constructing CE,
                 
ADC = DCE. By [Cor. 1.29.1], CE  AB.

                            
Corollary. 1.31.1. AB and CE in [1.31] may be replaced by segments of appropriate
length or rays, mutatis mutandis.

an equilateral ABC. Bisect the angles at points A and B by the lines AD and
                                                    
BD. Through D, construct parallels to AC and BC which intersect AB at E and F .

Proposition 1.32. EXTERIOR ANGLES AND SUMS OF ANGLES IN A TRIAN-
GLE.

If the side of a triangle is extended,
   (1) the exterior angle equals the sum of the its interior and opposite angles;
   (2) the sum of the three interior angles equals two right angles.

Proof. Construct ABC, and wlog extend side AB to segment AD.

                                            Figure 1.5.8: [1.32]

Claim 1: CBD = BAC + ACB.
Construct BE  AC [1.31]. Since BC intersects BE and AC, we find that EBC =
ACB [1.29]. Also, since AB intersects BE and AC, we find that DBE = BAC
[1.29]. Since CBD = EBC + DBE,

                                       CBD = ACB + BAC

Claim 2: BAC + ACB + ABC = two right angles.
Adding ABC to each side of the equality in claim 1, we obtain

                        ABC + CBD = ABC + ACB + BAC

By [1.13], ABC + CBD equals two right angles, and so
                                        BAC + ACB + ABC

equals two right angles. This completes the proof.

Corollary. 1.32.1. If a right triangle is isosceles, then each base angle equals half
of a right angle.

Corollary. 1.32.2. If two triangles have two angles in one respectively equal to two
angles in the other, then their remaining pair of angles is also equal.
82  CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

Corollary. 1.32.3. Since a quadrilateral can be divided into two triangles, the sum
of its angles equals four right angles.

Corollary. 1.32.4. If a figure of n sides is divided into triangles by drawing diag-
onals from any one of its angles, we will obtain (n - 2) triangles. Hence, the sum of
its angles equals 2(n - 2) right angles.

Corollary. 1.32.5. If all the sides of any convex polygon are extended, then the sum
of the external angles equals to four right angles.

Corollary. 1.32.6. Each angle of an equilateral triangle equals two-thirds of a right
angle.

Corollary. 1.32.7. If one angle of a triangle equals the sum of the other two, then it
is a right angle.

Corollary. 1.32.8. Every right triangle can be divided into two isosceles triangles
by a line constructed from the right angle to the hypotenuse.

Exercises.

1. Trisect a right angle.

2. If the sides of a polygon of n sides are extended, then the sum of the angles
between each alternate pair is equal to 2(n - 4) right angles.

3. If the line which bisects an external vertical angle of a triangle is parallel to
the base of the triangle, then the triangle is isosceles. [See the final chapter for a
solution.]

4. If two right triangles ABC, ABD are on the same hypotenuse AB and if the
vertices C and D are joined, then the pair of angles standing opposite any side of
the resulting quadrilateral are equal.

5. Prove that the three altitudes of a triangle are concurrent. Note: We are proving
the existence of the orthocenter39 of a triangle: the point where the three alti-
tudes intersect, and one of a triangle's points of concurrency40. [See the final
chapter for a solution.]

6. The bisectors of the adjacent angles of a parallelogram stand at right angles.
[See the final chapter for a solution.]

7. The bisectors of the external angles of a quadrilateral form a circumscribed

Proposition 1.33. PARALLEL SEGMENTS.

Segments which join adjacent endpoints of two equal, parallel segments are them-
selves parallel and equal in length.

Proof. Suppose that AB  CD and AB = CD. Construct ABDC. We claim that
AC = BD and AC  BD.

                                    Figure 1.5.9: [1.33] and [1.34]

Construct BC. Since AB  CD by hypothesis and BC intersects them, ABC =
DCB [Cor. 1.29.1].
Consider ABC and DCB: AB = DC, the triangles share side BC, and ABC =
DCB. By [1.4], ABC = DCB.
It follows that AC = BD and ACB = CBD. By [Cor. 1.29.1], ACB = CBD
implies that AC  BD, which completes the proof.

Corollary. 1.33.1. [1.33] holds for straight lines and rays, mutatis mutandis.

Corollary. 1.33.2. Figure ABDC is a parallelogram [Def. 1.39].

Proposition 1.34. OPPOSITE SIDES AND OPPOSITE ANGLES OF PARAL-
LELOGRAMS.

Opposite sides and opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal to one another and
either diagonal bisects the parallelogram.

Proof. Construct ABCD. We claim that:

   (1)AB = CD and AC = BD;

   (2)CAB = CDB;
   (3)ACD = ABD;

   (4) either diagonal (BC or AD) bisects the parallelogram.

Construct BC, and consider ABC and DBC: since AB  CD by construction
and BC intersects them, ABC = DCB and ACB = CBD [1.29]. Also, ABC
and DBC share side BC. By [1.26], ABC = DCB: it follows that AB = CD
and AC = BD (claim 1) and CAB = CDB (claim 2).
Now ACD = ACB + DCB and ABD = CBD + ABC. Since ACB =
CBD and DCB = ABC by [Cor. 1.29.1], we obtain

                                     ACD = ACB + DCB
                                                 = CBD + ABC
                                                 = ABD

(claim 3).

Since ABCD = ABC  DEF and ABC = DCB, ABC = DBC. It
follows that BC bisects ABCD. The remaining case follows mutatis mutandis if
we construct AD instead of BC (claim 4).

Corollary. 1.34.1. ABDC = 2 · ACB = 2 · BCD

Corollary. 1.34.2. If one angle of a parallelogram is a right angle, each of its angles
are right angles.

Corollary. 1.34.3. If two adjacent sides of a parallelogram are equal in length,
then it is a rhombus.

Corollary. 1.34.4. If both pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are equal in
length, it is a parallelogram.

Corollary. 1.34.5. If both pairs of opposite angles of a quadrilateral are equal, it is
a parallelogram.

allelogram.

bisect its angles.

Corollary. 1.34.9. If the adjacent sides of a parallelogram are equal, its diagonals

tices it joins, the parallelogram is a rhombus.

angles. [See the final chapter for a solution.]

Proposition 1.35. AREAS OF PARALLELOGRAMS I.

Parallelograms on the same base and between the same parallels are equal in area.

Proof. We shall prove three cases.

                                      Figure 1.5.10: [1.35], case 1

Case 1: Construct ABCD and F DBC on base BC and between parallels AF
and BC where ABCD and F DBC share the base and a vertex at D. We claim
that ABCD = F DBC.
By [Cor. 1.34.1], ADCB = 2 · BCD = F DBC, which proves case 1.

                                      Figure 1.5.11: [1.35], case 2

Case 2: Construct ABCD and EF CB on base BC and between parallels AF and
BC where ABCD and EF CB share the base and ED. We claim that ABCD =
EF CB.
Because ABCD is a parallelogram, AD = BC [1.34]; because BCEF is a paral-
lelogram, EF = BC, and so AD = EF . Notice that

                                       AD - ED = EF - ED
                                                AE = DF

Consider BAE and CDF : AE = DF , BA = CD [1.34], and BAE = CDF by
1.5. BOOK I, PROPOSITIONS 27-48                               89

[1.29, Cor. 1]. By [1.4], BAE = CDF . Notice that

                                   AF CB = EF CB + BAE
                                                = ABCD + CDF

Since BAE = CDF , ABCD = EF CB, proving case 2.

                                      Figure 1.5.12: [1.35], case 3

Case 3: Construct ABCD and EF CB on base BC and between parallels AF
and BC where ABCD and EF CB share the base and point G where G is not a
vertex. We claim that ABCD = EF CB.
Notice that AD = BC = EF . Since AD+DE = AE, DE +EF = DF , and AD = EF ,
we have AE = DF .
Consider BAE and CDF : BA = CD, AE = DF , and BAE = CDF by [1.29].
By [1.4], BAE = CDF , from which it follows that:

                                           BAE = CDF
                             BAE - DEG = CDF - DEG

                                           ADGB = CGEF
                              ADGB + BGC = CGEF + BGC

                                         ABCD = EF CB

This proves case 3 and completes the proof.
90  CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

Proposition 1.36. AREAS OF PARALLELOGRAMS II.

Parallelograms on equal bases and on the same parallels are equal in area.

                                                                       
Proof. Construct ADCB and EHGF between AH  BG on bases BC and F G
such that BC = F G. We claim that ADCB = EHGF .

                                           Figure 1.5.13: [1.36]

Construct BE and CH. Since EHGF is a parallelogram, F G = EH [1.34]. Since
BC = F G by hypothesis, BC = EH. Given this equality and BC  EH, by [1.33]
BE = CH and BE  CH. It follows that EHCB is a parallelogram.
By [1.35], EHCB = EHGF and EHCB = ADCB. Therefore, ADCB =
EHGF , which completes the proof.
1.5. BOOK I, PROPOSITIONS 27-48                                                    91

Proposition 1.37. TRIANGLES OF EQUAL AREA I.

Triangles which stand on the same base and in the same parallels are equal in
area.

Proof. Construct ABC and DBC on base BC such that each triangle stands
                          

between parallels AD and BC. We claim that ABC = DBC.

                                     Figure 1.5.14: [1.37]

                                
Construct BE  AC and CF  BD. It follows that AEBC and DBCF are

parallelograms. By [1.35], AEBC = DBCF .

Notice  that  1  ·  ABC   =    AEBC  because   the    diagonal  AB  bisects  AEBC  [1.34,
              2

#1].  Similarly,    1  ·  DBC  =  DBCF ,  and  so
                    2

                                  2 · ABC = 2 · DBC

                                     ABC = DBC

Proposition 1.38. TRIANGLES OF EQUAL AREA II.

Triangles which stand on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal in area.

                                                
Proof. Construct ABC and DEF between BF and AD such that BF  AD and

BC = EF . We claim that ABC = DEF .

                                           Figure 1.5.15: [1.38]

                                                                  
By [1.31], construct BG where G is a point on AD such that BG  AC; similarly,

                                                 
construct F H where H is a point on AD such that F H  DE. It follows that GACB
and DHF E are parallelograms. Since BC = EF , by [1.36] GACB = DHF E.
Since AB bisects GACB and DF bisects DHF E by [1.34], ABC = DEF ,
completing the proof.

Exercises.

1. Every median of a triangle bisects the triangle. [See the final chapter for a

Proposition 1.39. TRIANGLES OF EQUAL AREA III.

Triangles which are equal in area and stand on the same base and on the same side
of the base also stand between the same parallels.

Proof. Suppose that BAC and BDC stand on the same base, BC, on the same
side of BC, and that BAC = BDC; we claim BAC and BDC stand between
AD  BC.

                                           Figure 1.5.16: [1.39]

Construct AD. Clearly, the triangles stand between AD and BC. We need only
prove that AD  BC.
Suppose AD  BC and that AE  BC where E is a point on BD other than D;
construct EC. Notice that EDC > 0 (if EDC = 0, then E = D, a contradiction).
Since the triangles BEC, BAC stand on the same base BC and between the
same parallels (BC and AE), we find that BEC = BAC [1.37]. By hypothe-
sis, BAC = BDC. Therefore, BDC = BEC [Axiom 1.1]. But BDC =
BEC + EDC, and so EDC = 0 and EDC > 0. A similar contradiction
results if we place E anywhere other than on D.

It follows that AD  BC, which completes the proof.

Proposition 1.40. TRIANGLES OF EQUAL AREA IV.

Triangles which are equal in area and stand on equal bases on the same side of
their bases stand between the same parallels.

Proof. Construct ABC and DEF on BF such that BC = EF , CE > 0, ABC =
DEF , and where each triangle stands on the same side of its base. Construct AD.
Clearly, ABC and DEF stand between AD and BF ; we claim that AD  BF .

                                           Figure 1.5.17: [1.40]

If AD  BF , construct AG (where G is a point on DE) such that AG  BF . Also
construct F G. Notice that DF G > 0.
Consider the triangles GEF and ABC: they stand on equal bases (BC, EF )
and between the same parallels (BF , AG). By [1.38], GEF = ABC.
But DEF = ABC by hypothesis, and so DEF = GEF . Since DEF =
GEF + DGF , DGF = 0 and DF G > 0. A similar contradiction results if we
place G anywhere other than on D.
It follows that AD  BF , which completes the proof.

Proposition 1.41. PARALLELOGRAMS AND TRIANGLES.

If a parallelogram and a triangle stand on the same base and between the same
parallels, then the parallelogram is double the area of the triangle.

Proof. Construct ABCD and EBC on base BC and between AE  BC. We
claim that ABCD = 2 · EBC.

                                           Figure 1.5.18: [1.41]

Construct AC and DE. By [1.34], ABCD = 2·ABC; by [1.37], ABC = EBC.
Therefore, ABCD = 2 · EBC, which completes the proof.

Corollary. 1.41.1. If a triangle and a parallelogram have equal altitudes and if
the base of the triangle is double of the base of the parallelogram, then their areas
are equal.

Corollary. 1.41.2. Suppose we have two triangles whose bases are two opposite
sides of a parallelogram and which have any point between these sides as a common
vertex. Then the sum of the areas of these triangles equals half the area of the
parallelogram.

Proposition 1.42. CONSTRUCTION OF PARALLELOGRAMS I.

Given an arbitrary triangle and an arbitrary acute angle, it is possible to construct
a parallelogram equal in area to the triangle which contains the given angle.

Proof. Construct ABC and RDS. We wish to construct F GBE such that
F GBE = ABC and where F GBE contains an angle equal in measure to
RDS.

                                           Figure 1.5.19: [1.42]

Bisect AB at E, and construct EC. Construct BEF = RDS [1.23], CG  AB,
and BG  EF [1.31].
Because AE = EB by construction, AEC = EBC by [1.38]. Therefore, ABC =
2 · EBC. By [1.41], F GBE = 2 · EBC. Therefore, F GBE = ABC.
Since F GBE contains BEF where BEF = RDS, the proof is complete.

Proposition 1.43. COMPLEMENTS OF PARALLELOGRAMS.

Parallel segments through any point in one of the diagonals of a parallelogram di-
vides the parallelogram into four smaller parallelograms: the two through which
the diagonal does not pass are called the complements of the other two parallelo-
grams, and these complements are equal in area.

Proof. Construct ABCD and diagonal AC. Let K be any point on AC except A
or C. Construct GH and EF through K such that GH  CD and EF  AD. This

divides ABCD into four smaller parallelograms where EBGK, HKF D are
the complements of AEKH, KGCF . We claim that EBGK = HKF D.

                                           Figure 1.5.20: [1.43]

Because AC bisects the parallelograms ABCD, AEKH, and KGCF by [1.34],
we have ADC = ABC, AHK = AEK, and KF C = KGC. Therefore,

                            EBGK = ABC - AEK - KGC
                                           = ADC - AHK - KF C
                                           = HKF D

which completes the proof.

Corollary. 1.43.1. If through some point K within parallelogram ABCD we
have constructed parallel segments to its sides in order to make the parallelograms
HDF K, EKGB equal in area, then K is a point on the diagonal AC.
Given [1.43], we find that HDF K, EKGB equal in area if and only if K is a
point on the diagonal AC.

Corollary. 1.43.2. AHGB = ADF E and EF CB = HDCG.

Proposition 1.44. CONSTRUCTION OF PARALLELOGRAMS II.

Given an arbitrary triangle, an arbitrary angle (acute, right, or obtuse), and an
arbitrary segment, we can construct a parallelogram equal in area to the triangle
which contains the given angle and has a side length equal to the given segment.

Proof. Construct RST , N P Q, and AB. We wish to construct BALM on AB
such that BALM = N P Q and BALM contains an angle equal to RST .

                                           Figure 1.5.21: [1.44]

Construct the parallelogram BEF G where BEF G = N P Q [1.42], GBE =
RST , and AB  BE = AE. Also construct segment AH  BG [1.31]. Extend F G
to F H, and construct HB.

Since AH  BG and BG  F E by construction, AH  F E by [1.30]. Notice that HF
intersects AH and F E; therefore, AHF + HF E = two right angles. It follows
that BHG + GF E < two right angles. By [1.3.3, Axiom 4], if we extend HB and
F E, they will intersect at some point K. Through K, construct KL  AB [1.31],
extend AH to intersect KL at L, and extend GB to intersect KL at M . We claim
that BALM fulfills the required conditions.

Clearly, BALM is constructed on AB. By [1.43], BM LA = F EBG, and F EBG =
N P Q by construction; therefore BALM = N P Q. By [1.15], ABM = EBG,
and EBG = RST by construction; therefore, ABM = RST . This completes
the proof.
1.5. BOOK I, PROPOSITIONS 27-48  101

Proposition 1.45. CONSTRUCTION OF PARALLELOGRAMS III.

Given an arbitrary angle (acute, right, or obtuse) and an arbitrary polygon, we can
construct a parallelogram equal in area to the polygon which contains an angle
equal to the given angle.

Proof. Construct polygon ABCD and LM N . We wish to construct F IKE such
that it contains an angle equal to LM N and F IKE = ABCD.

                                           Figure 1.5.22: [1.45]

By [1.42]. we may construct BD and F GHE such that F GHE = ABD where
F EH = LM N .
On GH, construct GIKH such that GIKH = BCD where GHK = LM N
[1.44]. (We may continue to this algorithm for any additional triangles that remain
in ABCD. This allows us to claim that the proof which follows applies to any n-gon
where n < .) Upon completing this algorithm, we claim that F EKI fulfills the
required conditions.

Because GHK = LM N = F EH by construction, GHK = F EH. From this,
we obtain

                              GHK + GHE = F EH + GHE

Since HG  EF and EH intersects them, the sum F EH + GHE = two right
angles [1.29]. Hence, GHK + GHE = two right angles, and so EH  HK = EK
[1.14, Cor. 1]. Since EH  F G by construction, we now have EK  F G.

Similarly to the above, because GH intersects the parallels F G and EK, F GH =
GHK [Cor. 1.29.1], and so

                              F GH + HGI = GHK + HGI

Since GI  HK and GH intersects them, the sum GHK + HGI = two right
angles [1.29]. Hence, F GH + HGI = two right angles, and F G  GI = F I.
Because F EHG and GHKI are parallelograms, EF and KI are each parallel
to GH; by [1.30], EF  KI. Since GHK = F GH by the above, by [Cor. 1.29.1],
EK  F I. Therefore, F IKE is a parallelogram.
102  CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

Since F EK = LM N , F IKE contains an angle equal to a LM N .

                                           Figure 1.5.23: [1.45]

Because F GHE = ABD by construction and GIKH = BCD,
                                  ABCD = ABD  BCD
                                               = F GHE  GIKH
                                               = F IKE

which completes the proof.

Proposition 1.46. CONSTRUCTION OF A SQUARE I.

Given an arbitrary segment, we may construct a square on that segment.

Proof. Construct AB; we wish to construct a square on AB.

                  Figure 1.5.24: [1.46]

Construct AD  AB [1.11] where AD = AB [1.3]. Through D, construct CD  AB
[1.31] where AB = CD, and through B construct BC  AD. We claim that ABCD
is the required square.

By construction,

                  AD = AB = CD

Because ABCD is a parallelogram, AD = BC [1.34]; hence, all four sides of
ABCD are equal. It follows that ABCD is a rhombus and DAB is a right
angle. By [Def. 1.30], ABCD is a square.

Remark. [1.46] is a lemma to [1.47]. [2.14] offers a second method to construct a
square.

Proposition 1.47. THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM (aka. THE GOUGU / SHANG
GAO THEOREM).

In a right triangle, the square on the side opposite the right angle (the hypotenuse)
is equal in area to the sum of the areas of the squares on the remaining sides.

Proof. Construct right triangle ABC where AB is the hypotenuse. We claim that
                                            AB2 = AC2 + BC2

                                           Figure 1.5.25: [1.47]

By [1.46], we may construct squares on sides AB, BC, and CA of ABC as in
Fig. 1.5.25. Construct CL  AG where L is a point on GF . Also construct CG
and BK. Because both ACB and ACH are right angles by construction, the
sum ACB + ACH equals two right angles. Therefore BC  CH = BH [1.14].
Similarly, AC  CD = AD.

Because BAG and CAK are each angles within a square, they are right angles.
Hence,

                                            BAG = CAK
                               BAG + BAC = CAK + BAC

                                            CAG = KAB

Since BAGF and CHKA are squares, BA = AG and CA = AK. Consider
CAG and KAB: since CA = AK, BA = AG, and CAG = KAB, by [1.4]
CAG = KAB.
1.5. BOOK I, PROPOSITIONS 27-48                             105

By [1.41], AGLO = 2 · CAG because they both stand on AG and stand between
the parallels AG and CL. Similarly, CHKA = 2 · KAB because they stand on
AK and between AK and BH. Since CAG = KAB, AGLO = KACH.

Similarly, it can be shown that OLF B = DCBE. Hence,

                                    AB2 = AGF B
                                             = AGLO  OLF B
                                             = KACH + DCBE
                                             = AC2 + BC2

which proves our claim.

Remark. [1.47] is a special case of [6.31].

Remark. [Cor. 10.28.1] describes a ratio which provide Pythagorean Triples41 (three
positive integers a, b, and c such that a2 + b2 = c2): if a and b are positive integers
and b < a, then Pythagorean Triples follow the ratio

      a2 - b2 a2 + b2

106             CHAPTER 1. ANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, PARALLELOGRAMS

Alternatively:

Proof. Construct the squares as in Fig. 1.5.26 such that ACB is a right triangle
where ACB is the right angle.

                                Figure 1.5.26: [1.47], alternate proof

Construct CG and BK; through C construct OL  AG. Notice that GAK =
GAC + BAC + BAK and that BAG and CAK are right angles. It follows
that:

                                            BAG = CAK
                               BAG - BAC = CAK - BAC

                                            CAG = BAK

Consider CAG and BAK: CA = AK, AG = AB, and CAG = BAK; by [1.4],
CAG = BAK.
Applying [1.41], we find that GAOL = AKHC. Similarly, LOBF = DEBC.

Remark. The alternative proof is shorter since it's not necessary to prove that AC
and CD form one segment. Similarly, the proposition may be proven by taking
any of the eight figures formed by turning the squares in all possible directions.
Another simplification of the proof can be obtained by considering that the point A
is such that one of the triangles CAG or BAK can be turned round it in its own
plane until it coincides with the other; hence, they are congruent.

More generally, if the vertical angle of a triangle is equal to the angle of a regular

Proposition 1.48. THE CONVERSE OF THE PYTHAGOREAN/GOUGU THE-
OREM.

Construct squares on all sides of a triangle. If the square on the hypotenuse is
equal in area to the sum of the areas of the squares on the remaining sides, then
the angle opposite to the longest side is a right angle.

Proof. Construct ABC such that AB is the longest side and
                                            AB2 = AC2 + BC2

We claim that ACB is a right angle.

                                           Figure 1.5.27: [1.48]

Construct CD such that CD = CA [1.3] and CD  CB [1.11]. Construct BD, and
consider BCD: BCD is a right angle by construction. AC = CD implies that
AC2 = CD2, and so

                                       AC2 + CB2 = CD2 + CB2

By [1.47] CD2 + CB2 = BD2; by hypothesis, AC2 + CB2 = AB2. Hence AB2 = BD2;
it follows that AB = BD [1.46, #1].

Consider ACB and DCB: AB = DB, AC = CD by construction, and each
shares the side CD. By [1.8], ACB = DCB, and so ACB = DCB. Since
DCB is a right angle by construction, ACB is also a right angle.
1.5. BOOK I, PROPOSITIONS 27-48       109

An alternate proof by contradiction:

                              Figure 1.5.28: [1.48], alternative proof

Proof. Construct ABC such that AC2 + BC2 = AB2. If CB  CA, construct
CD  CA such that CD = CB. Construct AD.
Consider ABC and ADC: CD = CB, the triangles share side AC, and as in the
above proof, it can be shown that AD = AB. This contradicts [1.7]; it follows that,
ACB is a right angle.

Corollary. 1.48.1 Let a, b, and c be sides of A where c is the longest side. A is a
right triangle if and only if a2 + b2 = c2.

Rectangles

Chapter 2 proves a number of propositions that are familiar in the form of alge-
braic equations. Algebra as we know it had not been developed when Euclid wrote
"The Elements", and so the results are more of historical importance than practical
use (except when they are used in subsequent propositions). This is why Book II
appears in truncated form.
If definitions, postulates, or axioms from chapter 1 are used, they generally won't
be cited.

2.1 Definitions

1. If AB contains point C, then C is the point of division between AC and CB.
(Notice that the midpoint of AB is a special case of all such points of division.)
2. If AB is extended to point C, then point C is called a point of external division.

                          Figure 2.1.1: [Def. 2.1] above, [Def 2.2] below

3. A parallelogram whose angles are right angles is called a rectangle.

4. A rectangle is said to be contained by any two adjacent sides: thus, ABCD is
contained by sides AB and AD, or by sides AB and BC, etc.
5. The rectangle contained by two separate adjacent sides (such as AB and AD
above) is the parallelogram formed by constructing a perpendicular to AB at B
which is equal in length to AD and then constructing parallels.
The area of the rectangle is written AB · AD.

                                         Figure 2.1.3: [Def. 2.6]

6. In any parallelogram, a figure which is composed of either of the parallelograms
about a diagonal and the two complements is called a gnomon [see also 1.43]. If
in Fig. 2.1.3 we remove either of the parallelograms AGDE or OF CH (but not
both) from the parallelogram ADCB, the remaining object is a gnomon.
7. A segment divided as in [2.11] is said to be divided in "extreme and mean ratio."

2.2 Axioms

1. A semicircle (half-circle) may be constructed given only a center point and a
radius.

Proposition 2.5. If a segment (AB) is divided into two equal parts (at C) and also
into two unequal parts (at D), the rectangle contained by the unequal parts (AD,
DB) together with the square on the part between the points of section (CD) is equal
in area to the square on half the line.

Figure 2.3.5: [2.5]

Corollary. 2.5.1. Algebraically, [2.5] states1

xy =  (x + y)2 (x - y)2
                                +
      2                                         2

This may also be expressed as AD · DB + (CD)2 = (AC)2 = (CB)2.

Corollary. 2.5.2. The rectangle AD · DB is the rectangle contained by the sum
of the segments AC, CD and their difference, and we have proved it equal to the
difference between the square on AC and the square on CD. Hence the difference of
the squares on two segments is equal to the rectangle contained by their sum and
their difference.

Corollary. 2.5.3. The perimeter of the rectangle AH = 2 · AB, and is therefore
independent of the position of the point D on AB. The area of the same rectangle is
less than the square on half the segment by the square on the subsegment between
D and the midpoint of the line; therefore, when D is the midpoint, the rectangle will
have the maximum area. Hence, of all rectangles having the same perimeter, the
square has the greatest area.

Exercises.

1. Divide a given segment so that the rectangle contained by its parts has a maxi-
mum area.

2. Divide a given segment so that the rectangle contained by its subsegments is
equal to a given square, not exceeding the square on half the given line.

square on the segment between the midpoint and the endpoint of the second segment.

Proposition 2.7. If a segment (AB) is divided into any two parts (at C), the sum

segment, together with the square on the remaining segment.

                                                   = y2 + 2xz

Or,
                               (AB)2 + (BC)2 = 2 · AB · BC + (AC)2

Proposition 2.10. If a segment (AB) is bisected (at C) and is extended to a segment
(AD), the sum of the areas of the squares on the segments (AD, DB) made by the
endpoint (D) is equal to twice the area of the square on half the segment and twice
the square on the segment between the points of that section.

Proposition 2.11. It is possible to divide a given segment (AB) into two segments

Corollary. 2.11.2. The segment CF is divided in "extreme and mean ratio" at A.

Corollary. 2.11.3. If from the greater segment CA of CF we take a segment equal
to AF , it is evident that CA will be divided into parts respectively equal to AH, HB.
Hence, if a segment is divided in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment will
be cut in the same manner by taking on it a part equal to the less, and the less will
be similarly divided by taking on it a part equal to the difference, and so on.

Corollary. 2.11.4. Let AB be divided in "extreme and mean ratio" at C. It is evident
([2.11], Cor. 2) that AC > CB. Cut off CD = CB. Then by ([2.11], Cor. 2), AC is cut
in "extreme and mean ratio" at D, and CD > AD. Next, cut off DE = AD, and in the
same manner we have DE > EC, and so on. Since CD > AD, it is evident that CD
is not a common measure of AC and CB, and therefore not a common measure of AB
and AC. Similarly, AD is not a common measure of AC and CD and so is therefore
not a common measure of AB and AC. Hence, no matter how far we proceed, we
cannot arrive at any remainder which will be a common measure of AB and AC.
Hence, the parts of a line divided in "extreme and mean ratio" are incommensurable
(i.e., their ratio will never be a rational number).

taining the obtuse angle (BC, CA) by twice the area of the rectangle contained by
either of them (BC) and its extension (CD) to meet a perpendicular (AD) on it from
the opposite angle.

                               (AB)2 = (AC)2 + (BC)2 + 2 · BC · CD

and the intercept (CD) between the acute angle and the foot of the perpendicular on
it from the opposite angle.

Proposition 2.14. CONSTRUCTION OF A SQUARE II. It is possible to construct
a square equal in area to any given polygon.

Proof. We wish to construct a square equal in area to polygon M N P Q.

                                           Figure 2.3.15: [2.14]

Construct rectangle ABCD equal in area to M N P Q [1.45]. If any two adjacent
sides of ABCD are equal, then ABCD is a square and we have completed the
construction.
Otherwise, extend side AB to AE such that BE = BC. Bisect AE at F , and with F
as center and F E as radius, construct semicircle AGE. Extend CB to the semicircle
at G. We claim that the square constructed on BG is equal in area to M N P Q.
To see this, construct F G. Because AE is divided equally at F and unequally at B,
by [2.5] AB · BE + (F B)2 = (F E)2. Also, (F E)2 = (F G)2, since both are radii of
semicircle AGE. By [1.47], (F G)2 = (F B)2 + (BG)2. Therefore,

                               AB · BE + (F B)2 = (F B)2 + (BG)2
                                           AB · BE = (BG)2
                                           AB · BC = (BG)2
                                           ABCD = (BG)2

which completes the construction.

Corollary. 2.14.1. The square on the perpendicular from any point on a semicircle
to the diameter is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the diameter.

Circles

Axioms and Mathematical Properties from chapters 1 and 2 will be assumed and
not generally cited. This will be a rule that we will apply to subsequent chapters,
mutatis mutandis.
Remark. Modern geometry no longer uses Euclid's definitions for curves, tangents,
etc. However, for our purposes, the definitions are adequate.

3.1 Definitions

1. Equal circles are circles with equal radii.1
2. A chord of a circle is a segment which intersects two points of the circle's cir-
cumference. If the chord is extended to a line, then this line is called a secant, and
each of the parts into which a secant divides the circumference is called an arc--the
larger is called the major conjugate arc, and the smaller is called the minor conju-
gate arc.
3. A segment, ray, or straight line is said to touch a circle when it intersects the cir-
cumference of a circle at one and only one point. The segment, ray, or straight line
is called a tangent to the circle, and the point where it touches the circumference is
called the point of intersection.

    1This is actually a theorem, and not a definition. If two circles have equal radii, they are evidently
congruent figures and therefore equal in all aspects. Using this method to prove the theorem, [3.26]-
[3.29] follow immediately.

Figure 3.1.1: [Def. 3.3] CD touches A at B; or, CD is tangent to
       
point of intersection between A and CD.

4. Circles are said to touch one another when they intersect at one and only one
point. There are two types of contact:

   a) When one circle is external to the other.

   b) When one circle is internal to the other.

When circles intersect at two points, the intersection may be referred to as a cut.
3.1. DEFINITIONS  139

Figure 3.1.2: On the left: [Def. 3.4] The circles A and D touch externally at E,
while the circles C and A touch internally at B. On the right: [Def. 3.5] The
chord CD of the circle A divides the circle itself into segments DEC and DBC.
Segment DEC (shaded) is bounded by chord CD and arc DEC, and segment DBC
(unshaded) is bounded by chord CD and arc DBC.

5. A segment of a circle is a two-dimensional figure bounded by a chord and an arc
whose boundary points include the endpoints of the chord.

6. Chords are said to be equally distant from the center when the perpendiculars
constructed to them from the center are equal in length.

7. The angle in the segment is the rectilinear angle contained between two chords
which intersect at the same endpoint on the circumference of a circle. In Fig. 3.1.3,
DCE is an angle in the segment. See also [3.21].

8. The angle of a segment is the non-rectilinear angle contained between its chord
and the tangent at either endpoint. In Fig. 3.1.3, the arc DEC is the angle of
segment DEC. These angles only appeared in the original proof to [3.16].

9. An angle in a segment is said to stand on its conjugate arc.

10. Similar arcs are those that contain equal angles.

11. A sector of a circle is formed by two radii and the arc that is included between
them. In Fig. 3.1.3, A, radius AD, and radius AC form the sectors DACE and
DAC B .

                      Figure 3.1.3: [Def. 3.8], [Def. 3.9], and [Def. 3.11]

12. Concentric circles are those which have the same center point.
13. Points which lie on the circumference of a circle are called concyclic.
14. A cyclic quadrilateral is a quadrilateral which is inscribed in a circle.
15. A modern definition on an angle2: an angle in geometry is the figure formed by
two rays, called the sides of the angle, which share a common endpoint, called the
vertex of the angle. This measure is the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its
radius, where the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides.
The size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the
smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles that have the
same size are called congruent angles.

     Figure 3.1.4: The measure of angle  is the quotient of s and r.

In order to measure an angle , a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle
is constructed, e.g., with a pair of compasses. The length of the arc is then divided
by the radius of the arc r, and possibly multiplied by a scaling constant k (which
depends on the units of measurement that are chosen):

                                      = ks/r

2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle
3.1. DEFINITIONS                                                                          141

The value of  thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of
the radius is changed, then the arc length changes in the same proportion, and so
the ratio s/r is unaltered.

                                 Figure 3.1.5:  = s/r rad = 1 rad.

A number of units are used to represent angles: the radian and the degree are by
far the most commonly used.

Most units of angular measurement are defined such that one turn (i.e. one full

circle) is equal to n units, for some whole number n. In the case of degrees, n = 360.

A  turn  of  n  units  is  obtained  by  setting  k  =  n  in  the  formula  above.
                                                        2

The radian is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle (that is, the angle standing

opposite the arc of a circle) that has the same length as the circle's radius. The

case of radian for the formula given earlier, a radian of n = 2 units is obtained

by setting k =  2          = 1.  One  turn  is  2    radians,  and  one  radian  is  180  degrees,
                2                                                                     

or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated rad, though this symbol is

often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified

otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The

radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry,

due, for example, to the pleasing and "natural" properties that the trigonometric

functions display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived)

unit of angular measurement in the SI system.

The degree, written as a small superscript circle (), is 1/360 of a turn, so one turn
is 360. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5
for three and a half degrees), but the "minute" and "second" sexagesimal sub-units
of the "degree-minute-second" system are also in use, especially for geographical
coordinates and in astronomy and ballistics.

Although the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the con-
cept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows
positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and/or rotations in
opposite directions relative to some reference.

In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, an angle is typically defined by
its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The initial side is on the positive x-axis,
while the other side or terminal side is defined by the measure from the initial
side in radians, degrees, or turns. Positive angles represent rotations toward the
positive y-axis, and negative angles represent rotations toward the negative y-axis.
142  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

When Cartesian coordinates are represented by standard position, defined by the
x-axis rightward and the y-axis upward, positive rotations are anticlockwise and
negative rotations are clockwise.

OF · OP is equal to the area of the square of the radius of that circle, then F and P
are called inverse points with respect to the circle.
17. The supplement of an arc is the amount by which an arc is less than a semicir-
cle, or an angle less than two right angles.

Proposition 3.1. THE CENTER OF A CIRCLE I.

It is possible to locate the center of a circle.

Proof. Construct a circle and take any two points A, B on the circumference. Con-
struct AB and bisect AB at C [1.10]. Construct CD  AB (where D is on the
circumference) and extend CD to intersect the circumference at E. Bisect DE at F .
We claim that F is the center of the circle.

                                             Figure 3.2.1: [3.1]

Suppose instead that point G, which does not lie on chord DE, is the center of the
circle. Construct GA, GC, and GB. Notice that ACG = ACD + DCG; clearly,
DCG > 0.
Consider ACG and BCG: we have AC = CB by construction, GA = GB (since
they are radii by hypothesis), and side CG is shared in common. By [1.8], we find
that ACG = BCG; therefore, each angle is a right angle. But ACD is right by
construction; therefore DCG = 0. But DCG > 0 above, a contradiction.
Hence, no point can be the center of the circle other than a point on DE. Since all
radii are equal in length and F E = F D, it follows that F , the midpoint of DE, is
the center of F . This proves our claim.
144             CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES
Alternatively:

Proof. Consider the objects constructed in the proof above: because ED  AB and
ED bisects AB, every point equally distant from the points A and B must lie on
ED [1.10, #2]. Since the center is equally distant from A and B, the center must lie
on ED. And since the center must also lie equally distant from E and D, the center
is the midpoint of ED.

Corollary. 3.1.1. The line, ray, or segment which bisects any chord of a circle per-
pendicularly passes through the center of the circle.

Corollary. 3.1.2. The locus of the centers of the circles which pass through two fixed
points is the line bisecting at right angles the line that connects the two points.

Corollary. 3.1.3. If A, B, C are three points on the circumference of a circle, the
lines which perpendicularly bisect the chords AB, BC will intersect at the center of
the circle.

Proposition 3.2. POINTS ON A LINE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE A CIRCLE.

If any two points are chosen from the circumference of a circle and a line is con-
structed on those points, then:

   (1) The points between the endpoints on the circumference form a chord (i.e., they
lie inside the circle).

   (2) The remaining points of the line lie outside the circle.

Proof. Construct C where A and B are arbitrary points on the circumference of
                         

  C and construct AB. We claim that:

   (1) AB is a chord of C.
                         

   (2) All points of AB which are not on AB lie outside of the circle.

                                             Figure 3.2.2: [3.2]

Take any point D on AB and construct CA, CD, and CB. Notice that ADC >
ABC by [1.16]; however, ABC = BAC because CAB is isosceles [1.5]. There-
fore, ADC > BAC = DAC. By [1.29], AC > CD [1.29], and so CD is less than
the radius of C. Consequently, D must lie within the circle [Def. 1.23]. Similarly,
every other point between A and B lies within C. Finally, since A and B are
points in the circumference of C, AB is a chord. This proves claim 1.

                                       -
Wlog, let E be any point on AE such that EA > BA, and construct CE. By [1.16],
ABC > AEC; by the above, CAE > AEC. It follows that in ACE, CE >
CA, and so the point E lies outside C. This proves claim 2, which completes the
proof.

Corollary. 3.2.1. Three collinear points cannot be concyclic.

Corollary. 3.2.2. A straight line, ray, or segment cannot intersect a circle at more
than two points.

Proposition 3.3. CHORDS I.

Suppose there exist two chords of a circle, only one of which passes through the cen-
ter of the circle. The chord which does not pass through the center is bisected by the
chord that passes through the center if and only if the chords are perpendiculars.

Proof. Construct O with chords AB and CD where AB contains the center of O.
We claim that AB bisects CD if and only if AB  CD.

                                             Figure 3.2.3: [3.3]

Suppose that AB bisects CD. Construct OC and OD, and consider CEO and
DEO: CE = ED by hypothesis, OC = OD since each are radii of O, and both
triangles have EO in common. By [1.8], CEO = DEO; since they are also
adjacent angles, each is a right angle, and therefore AB  CD.
Now suppose that AB  CD. Because OC = OD, CDO is isosceles; by [1.5],
OCD = ODC. Consider OEC and OED: OCD = ODC, CEO = DEO
since AB  CD, and they share side EO. By [1.26], OEC = OED, and so
CE = ED. Since CD = CE  ED, AB bisects CD, proving our claim.

The second part of the proposition may also be proved this way:

Proof. By [1.47], we find that

                                      (OC)2 = (OE)2 + (EC)2
                                      (OD)2 = (OE)2 + (ED)2

Since OC = OD, we also have that (OC)2 = (OD)2, and it follows that (EC)2 =
(ED)2. Therefore, EC = ED.

Proposition 3.4. CHORDS II.

If two chords exist in a circle where at most one is a diameter, then it is not the case
that each chord bisects the other.

Proof. Construct O with chords AB and CD such that at most one of these chords
is a diameter and such that AB and CD intersect at E where AEC > 0. If AB
and CD are not diameters, they do not contain O. Construct OE and extend OE to
F G. We claim it is not the case that AE = EB and CE = ED.

                                             Figure 3.2.4: [3.4]

Suppose instead that AE = EB and CE = ED. By [3.3], OEA is a right angle.
Similarly, OEC is a right angle, or OEA = OEC. But OEC = OEA+AEC,
and so AEC = 0. It follows that AEC > 0 and AEC = 0, a contradiction.
Thus it is not the case that AE = EB and CE = ED, which completes the proof.

Corollary. 3.4.1. If two chords of a circle bisect each other, they are both diameters.

Proposition 3.5. NON-CONCENTRIC CIRCLES I.

If two circles intersect at exactly two points, then they are not concentric.

Proof. Construct ABC and ABD which intersect at A and B; we claim that
  ABC and ABD are not concentric.

                                             Figure 3.2.5: [3.5]

Suppose instead that ABC and ABD share a common center, O. Construct OA
and OCD where A, B, C, and D are distinct. Notice that CD > 0.
Because O is the center of ABC, OA = OC. Because O is the center of the circle

  ABD, OA = OD; hence, OD = OC where OD = OC  CD. It follows that CD = 0
and CD > 0, a contradiction. Therefore, ABC and ABD are not concentric.

Proposition 3.6. NON-CONCENTRIC CIRCLES II.

If one circle intersects another circle internally at exactly one point, then the circles
are not concentric.

Proof. Construct ADE and ABC such that ABC intersects ADE internally
at A and only at A. We claim that ADE and ABC are not concentric.

                                             Figure 3.2.6: [3.6]

Suppose instead that ADE and ABC are concentric, and let O be the center of
each circle. Construct OA and OBD. Notice that BD > 0; if BD = 0, then B = D
and ADE and ABC intersect at two points, contrary to hypothesis.
Because O is the center of each circle by hypothesis, OA = OB and OA = OD;
therefore, OB = OD and OB  BD = OD. Hence, BD = 0, a contradiction. There-
fore, the circles are not concentric.
152  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Proposition 3.7. UNIQUENESS OF SEGMENT LENGTHS FROM A POINT ON
THE DIAMETER OTHER THAN THE CENTER.

Choose any point on the diameter of a circle other than the center, and from that
point construct a finite number of segments to the circumference. Then:

   (1) The longest segment constructed will contain the center of the circle.
   (2) The shortest segment constructed will form a diameter with the longest seg-
ment.
   (3) As for the remaining segments, those with endpoints on the circumference
nearer to the endpoint of the longest segment will be longer than segments with
endpoints farther from the endpoint of the longest segment.
   (4) Two and only two equal segments can be constructed from each point to the
circumference, one on each side of the diameter.

Proof. Construct O with point P on diameter AE such that O and P are distinct.
Construct a finite number of segments from P to the circumference (P A, P B, P C,
etc.). Notice that P A is a segment on the diameter. We will prove four claims.

                                        Figure 3.2.7: [3.7] EAG

1. The longest segment, P A, is the segment which passes through O.
Construct OB where B is a point on O. Clearly, OA = OB. From this we obtain
P A = OA + OP = OB + OP . Consider OP B: since OB + OP > P B by [1.20],
it follows that P A > P B. Since this inequality holds for any segment constructed
using this method, P A is the longest segment of all such constructed segments.

2. The extension of P A in the opposite direction, P E, is the shortest segment of all
such constructed segments.
Construct OD and consider OP D: by [1.20], OP + P D > OD. Since, OD = OE =
OP + P E, it follows that

                                        OP + P D > OP + P E
                                                PD > PE
3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III  153

Since this inequality holds for any segment constructed using this method, P E is
the shortest segment of all such constructed segments.

                                        Figure 3.2.8: [3.7] EAG

3. As for the remaining segments, those with endpoints on the circumference
nearer to the endpoint of the longest segment (P A) will be longer than segments
with endpoints farther from the endpoint of the longest segment (i.e., P A > P B >
P C > P D).

Construct OC, and consider P OB and P OC: OB = OC and each shares side
OP . Since P OB = P OC + BOC, we find that P OB > P OC. By [1.24],
P B > P C. Similarly, P C > P D.

4. Two and only two segments making equal angles with the diameter and standing
on opposite sides of the diameter are equal in length (i.e., P D = P F ).

At O, construct P OF = P OD and construct P F . Consider P OD and P OF :
OD = OF , each shares side OP , and P OD = P OF by construction. By [1.4],
P OD = P OF , and so OP F = OP D and P D = P F .
We claim that a third segment cannot be constructed from P equal to P D = P F .
Suppose this were possible and let P G = P D. Then P G = P F , contradicting claim
3 above.

This completes the proof.
154  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Corollary. 3.7.1. If two equal segments P D, P F are constructed from a point P to

the circumference of a circle, the diameter through P bisects the angle DP F formed
by these segments.

Corollary. 3.7.2. If P is the common center of circles whose radii are P A, P B, P C,
P D, etc., then:

   (1) The circle whose radius is the maximum segment ( P with radius P A) lies
outside O and intersects it at A [Def. 3.4].

   (2) The circle whose radius is the minimum segment ( P with radius P E) lies
inside O and intersects it at E.

   (3) A circle having any of the remaining radii (such as P D) cuts O at two points
(such as D, F ).

Exercises.
1. Prove [Cor. 3.7.1].
2. Prove [Cor. 3.7.2].

Remark. [3.7] is a good illustration of the following important definition: if a geo-
metrical magnitude varies its position continuously according to any well-defined
relationship, and if it retains the same value throughout, it is said to be a constant
(such as the radius of a fixed circle).
But if a magnitude increases for some time and then begins to decrease, it is said
to be a maximum when the increase stops. Therefore in the previous figure, P A,
which we suppose to revolve around P and meet the circle, is a maximum.
Again, if it decreases for some time, and then begins to increase, it is a minimum
at the beginning of the increase. Thus P E, which we suppose as before to revolve
around P and meet the circle, is a minimum. [3.8] will provide other illustrations
of this concept.

Proposition 3.8. SEGMENT LENGTHS FROM A POINT OUTSIDE THE CIR-
CLE AND THEIR UNIQUENESS.

Suppose a point is chosen outside of a circle and from that point segments are
constructed such that they intersect the circumference of the circle at two points,
one on the "outer" or convex side of the circumference and one on the "inner" or
concave side of the circumference. Let one segment be constructed which intersects
the center of the circle and the others all within the same semicircle but not through
the center of the circle. Then:

   (1) The largest segment passes through the center.

   (2) The segments nearer to the segment through the center are greater in length
than those which are farther away.

   (3) If segments are constructed to the convex circumference, the minimum seg-
ment is that which passes through the center when extended.

   (4) Of the other segments, that which is nearer to the minimum is smaller than
one more farther out.

   (5) From the given point outside of the circle, there can be constructed two equal
segments to the concave or the convex circumference, both of which make equal
angles with the line passing through the center.

   (6) Three or more equal segments cannot be constructed from the given point
outside the circle to either circumference.

Proof. Construct O, point P outside of O, and all points indicated in the figure
below. We will prove each claim separately.

Figure 3.2.9: [3.8] O
156  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

1. The maximum segment passes through the center.

Notice that OA = OB and so AP = OA + OP = OB + OP . Consider BOP :
OB + OP > BP [1.20]. Therefore, AP > BP .

                                         Figure 3.2.10: [3.8] O

2. The segments nearer to the segment through the center are greater in length
than those which are farther.
Consider BOP and COP : OB = OC, each share side OP , and the angle BOP >
COP . Therefore, BP > CP [1.24]. Similarly, CP > DP , etc.

3. If segments are constructed to the convex circumference, the minimum segment
is that which passes through the center when extended.
Consider OF P : OF + F P > OP = OE + EP [1.20]. Since OF = OE, we find that
FP > EP.

4. Of the other segments, that which is nearer to the minimum is smaller than one
more farther out.
Consider GOP and F OP : GO = F O, each shares side OP , and the angle
GOP > F OP . By [1.24], GP > F P . Similarly, HP > GP .

5. From the given point outside of the circle, there can be constructed two equal
segments to the concave or the convex circumference, both of which make equal
angles with the line passing through the center.
Construct P OI such that P OI = P OF [1.23], and consider IOP and F OP :
IO = F O, each shares side OP , and IOP = P OF by construction. By [1.4],
IP = F P . Segments IP and F P fulfill the above requirements, which proves this
claim.

6. Three or more equal segments cannot be constructed from the given point outside
the circle to either circumference.
3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III                                                157

Above, we obtain IP = F P . We claim that a third segment cannot is constructed
from P equal to IP and F P . Suppose this were possible and let P K = P F . However
by claim 4, P K > P F . This contradiction proves our claim.

Corollary. 3.8.1. If P I is extended to meet the circle at L, then P L = P B.

Corollary. 3.8.2. If two equal segments are constructed from P to either the convex
or concave circumference, the diameter through P bisects the angle between them,
and the segments intercepted by the circle are equal in length.

Corollary. 3.8.3. If P is the common center of circles whose radii are segments
constructed from P to the circumference of O, then:

a) The circle whose radius is the minimum segment (P E) has external contact with
  O [Def. 3.4].

b) The circle whose radius is the maximum segment (P A) has internal contact with
  O.

c) A circle having any of the remaining segments (P F ) as radius intersects O at
two points (F , I).

Proposition 3.9. THE CENTER OF A CIRCLE II.

A point within a circle from which three or more equal segments can be constructed
to the circumference is the center of that circle.

Proof. Construct ABC and equal segments DA, DB, and DC. We claim that D is
the center of ABC.

                                            Figure 3.2.11: [3.9]

Construct AB and BC and bisect them at points E and F , respectively [1.10]. Then
construct GEDK and LDF H.
Consider AED and BED: ED is a common side, AE = EB, and DB = DA
since each are radii of ABC. By [1.8], AED = BED, and so AED = BED;
it follows that AED and BED are each right angles.
Since GEDK  AB and GEDK bisects AB, [3.1, Cor. 1] states that the center of

  ABC is a point on GEDK. Similarly, the center of ABC is a point on LDF H.
Since GEDK and LDF H intersect at D, D is the center of ABC.

Alternatively:

Proof. Since AD = LD, the segment bisecting the angle ADL passes through
the center [3.7, Cor. 1]. Similarly, the segment bisecting the angle BDA passes
through the center. Hence, the point of intersection of these bisectors, D, is the
center.

Proposition 3.10. THE UNIQUENESS OF CIRCLES.

If two circles have more than two points of their circumferences in common, they
coincide.

Proof. Construct ABC and DAB such that they have more than two points in
common. We claim that ABC and DAB coincide.

                                           Figure 3.2.12: [3.10]

Suppose that ABC and DAB share three points in common (A, B, C). From P ,
the center of ABC, construct P A, P B, P C; since each is a radius, P A = P B = P C.
Since DAB is a circle and P a point from which three equal segments P A, P B,
P C can be constructed to its circumference, P is also the center of DAB [3.9]. By
[Def. 3.1] ABC and DAB coincide, which proves our claim.

Remark. Similarly to [3.10, Cor. 1], two lines which do not coincide cannot have
more than one point common.

Proposition 3.11. SEGMENTS CONTAINING CENTERS OF CIRCLES.

If one circle touches another circle internally at one point, then the line joining the
centers of the two circles must contain that point of intersection.

Proof. Construct O and H such that H touches O internally at P . Also con-
            
struct OH. We claim that OH contains P .

              Figure 3.2.13: [3.11]

                                                                                                       
Suppose instead that E is the center of H such that E does not lie on OP , and
construct EP . Extend OE to intersect H at C and D and intersect O at A and
B. Since E is a point on the diameter of O between O and A, EA < EP [3.7].

Notice that EA = EC + CA. Since CA > 0, EA > EC. Also notice that EP =

EC since each are radii of H, and so EA > EP . But EA < EP above; this

contradiction demonstrates that the center of the internal circle, H, must lie on
                                          
OP ; that is, OP contains H. Equivalently, OH contains P , which concludes the

proof.

Alternatively:

Proof. Since EP is a segment constructed from a point within the circle O to the
circumference of O but not forming part of the diameter through E, the circle
whose center is E with radius EP cuts H at P [3.7, Cor. 2] and also touches it
at P by hypothesis, a contradiction. A similar argument holds for all points not on
OP . Hence, the center of O must lie on OP .

Proposition 3.12. INTERSECTING CIRCLES I.

If two circles intersect externally at one point, then the segment joining their cen-
ters contains that point of intersection.

Proof. Construct P CF and P DE which intersect externally at point P . Also
construct AG. We claim that AG contains P .

                                           Figure 3.2.14: [3.12]

Construct AP E; a claim equivalent to the above is that AP E contains G.
Suppose instead that B is the center of P DE and is not on AP E. Construct AB,
intersecting P DE at D and P CF at C but not intersecting at P . Also construct
BP . By our hypothesis, AP = AC and BP = BD. Hence

                                          AC + DB = AP + BP

Also notice that AB = AC CDDB where CD > 0; it follows that AB > AC +DB.
By the above equality, AB > AP + BP .
Consider AP B: we find that one side of AP B is greater than the sum of the
other two, contradicting [1.20]. Thus, the center of P DE lies on AP E at G. Equiv-
alently, AG contains P , which completes the proof.

Alternatively:

Proof. Suppose that the center of P DE lies on BP . Since BP is a segment con-
structed from a point outside of the circle P CF to its circumference which does
not pass through the center when it is extended, the circle whose center is B with
radius BP must cut the circle P CF at P [3.8, Cor. 3].
However, such a circle touches P CF at P by hypothesis, a contradiction. Since
BP was chosen as any segment other than P E, the center of P DE must lie on
P E.
162  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Remark. [3.11] and [3.12] may written as one theorem: "If two circles touch each
other at any point, the centers and that point are collinear." This is a limiting case
of the theorem given in [3.3, Cor. 4]: "The line joining the centers of two intersecting
circles bisects the common chord perpendicularly."

Figure 3.2.15: [3.12], Suppose O and O have two points of intersection, A and
B. Suppose further that A remains fixed while the second circle moves so that the
point B ultimately coincides with A. Since the segment OO always bisects AB, we
see that OO intersects A. In consequence of this motion, the common chord CD
becomes the tangent to each circle at A.

Corollary. 3.12.1. If two circles touch each other, their point of intersection is the
union of two points of intersection. When counting the number of points at which
two circles intersect, we may for purposes of calculation consider this point of inter-
section as two points.
3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III  163

Corollary. 3.12.2. If two circles touch each other at any point, they cannot have
any other common point.

                                       Figure 3.2.16: [3.2, Cor. 2]

For, since two circles cannot have more than two points common [3.10] and their
point of intersection is equivalent to two points for purposes of calculation, circles
that touch cannot have any other point common. The following is a formal proof of
this Corollary:

Construct O and O where A is the point of intersection, and let O lie between
O and A. Take any other point B in the circumference of O, and construct OB.
By [3.7], OB > OA. Therefore, B is outside the circumference of the inner circle.
Hence, B cannot be common to both circles. Since point B was chosen arbitrarily,
the circles cannot have any other common point except for A.

Proposition 3.13. INTERSECTING CIRCLES II.

Two circles cannot touch each other at two points either internally or externally.

Proof. We divide the proof into its internal and external cases:

                                           Figure 3.2.17: [3.13]

Internal case: suppose two distinct circles ACB and ADB touch internally at
two points A and B. Since the two circles touch at A, the segment joining their
centers passes through A [3.11]. Similarly, the segment joining their centers passes
through B. Hence, the centers of these circles and the points A and B are on AB,
and so AB is a diameter of each circle. Bisect AB at E: clearly, E is the center of
each circle, i.e., the circles are concentric. This contradicts [3.5], and thus ACB
and ADB do not touch internally at two points.
External case: if two circles E and H touch externally at points I and J where
I and J are distinct, then by [3.12] EH contains the points I and J; in other words,
I and J are not distinct, a contradiction. Thus, E and H do not touch externally
at two points.

An alternative proof to the internal case:

Proof. Construct a line bisecting AB perpendicularly. By [3.1, Cor. 1], this line
passes through the center of each circle, and by [3.11] and [3.12] must pass through
each point of intersection, a contradiction. Hence, two circles cannot touch each
other at two points.
3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III  165

Remark. This proposition is an immediate inference from [3.12, Cor. 1] that if
a point of intersection counts for two intersections, then two contacts would be
equivalent to four intersections; but there cannot be more than two intersections
[3.10]. It also follows from [3.12, Cor. 2] that if two circles touch each other at point
A, they cannot have any other point in common; hence, they cannot touch again at
B.

Exercises.

1. If a circle with a non-fixed center touches two fixed circles externally, the differ-
ence between the distances of its center from the centers of the fixed circles is equal
to the difference or the sum of their radii, according to whether the contacts are of
the same or of opposite type [Def. 3.4].

2. If a circle with a non-fixed center is touched by one of two fixed circles internally
and touches the other fixed circle either externally or internally, the sum of the
distances from its center to the centers of the fixed circles is equal to the sum or the
difference of their radii, according to whether the contact with the second circle is
internal or external.

3. Suppose two circles touch externally. If through the point of intersection any
secant is constructed cutting the circles again at two points, the radii constructed
to these points are parallel. [See the final chapter for a solution.]

4. Suppose two circles touch externally. If two diameters in these circles are par-
allel, the line from the point of intersection to the endpoint of one diameter passes
through the endpoint of the other. [See the final chapter for a solution.]

Proposition 3.14. EQUALITY OF CHORD LENGTHS.

Chords in a circle are equal in length if and only if they are equally distant from
the center.

Proof. Construct O with chords AB and CD. We claim that AB = CD if and only
if AB and CD are equally distant from the center.

                                           Figure 3.2.18: [3.14]

Suppose AB = CD, and construct OE  AB and OF  CD. We claim that EO =
F O.
Construct AO and CO. Because AB is a chord in O and OE is a perpendicular
segment constructed from the center to E, OE bisects AB [3.3]; or AE = EB.
Similarly, CF = F D. Since AB = CD by hypothesis, AE = CF .
Because OEF is a right angle, (AO)2 = (AE)2 + (EO)2 by [1.47]. Similarly,
(CO)2 = (CF )2 + (F O)2. Since (AO)2 = (CO)2 and (AE)2 = (CF )2, we have
(EO)2 = (F O)2, and so EO = F O.

Now suppose EO = F O under a construction similar to the above. We claim that
AB = CD.
Construct AO and CO. By [1.47] and similarly to the above proof, (AE)2 + (EO)2 =
(CF )2 + (F O)2 where (EO)2 = (F O)2 due to our hypothesis. Hence (AE)2 = (CF )2,
and so AE = CF . But AB = 2 · AE and CD = 2 · CF by [3.3], and so AB = CD.

Exercises.

      (a) the locus of its midpoint is a circle;

Proposition 3.15. INEQUALITY OF CHORD LENGTHS.

The diameter is the longest chord in a circle, and a chord is nearer to the center of
a circle than another chord if and only if it is the longer of the two chords.

Proof. Construct O with diameter AB and chords CD and EF such that CD is
nearer to O that EF . We claim that:

   (1) AB is the longest chord in a circle;
   (2) CD > EF ;
   (3) Longer chords are nearer to the center than shorter chords.

                                           Figure 3.2.19: [3.15]

(1) We claim that AB is the longest chord in a circle.
Construct OC, OD, OE as well as OG  CD and OH  EF . Notice that AB =
OA + OB = OC + OD. Consider CDO: OC + OD > CD by [1.20]. Therefore,
AB > CD. Since the choice of CD was arbitrary, the proof is complete.

(2) We claim that CD > EF .
Since CD is nearer to O than EF by hypothesis, it follows that OG < OH [3.14].
Since OGC and OHE are right triangles, we find that (OC)2 = (OG)2 + (GC)2
and (OE)2 = (OH)2 + (HE)2. Since OC = OE, (OG)2 + (GC)2 = (OH)2 + (HE)2.
But (OG)2 < (OH)2, and so (GC)2 > (HE)2. It follows that GC > HE. Since
CD = 2 · GC and EF = 2 · HE by [3.3], CD > EF .

(3) Longer chords are nearer to the center than shorter chords.
Suppose that CD > EF . We claim that OG < OH.
As before, we find that (OG)2 + (GC)2 = (OH)2 + (HE)2. Due to our hypothesis,
(GC)2 > (HE)2. Therefore (OG)2 < (OH)2, and so OG < OH.

Proposition 3.16. THE PERPENDICULAR TO A DIAMETER OF A CIRCLE.

The perpendicular to a diameter of a circle intersects the circumference at one and
only one point, and any other segment through the diameter's endpoint intersects
the circle at two points.

Proof. Construct C with points A, B, and H on its circumference where AB is a
                                   
diameter of C. Also construct BH and BI  AB where BI intersects C at B.

We claim that:

    
(1) BI touches C at B only;

(2) BH cuts C.

                                           Figure 3.2.20: [3.16]

            
Claim 1: BI touches C at B only.

                                           
Let I be an arbitrary point on BI and construct the segment CI. Because CBI
is a right angle, (CI)2 = (CB)2 + (BI)2 by [1.47]. It follows that (CI)2 > (CB)2,

                                                                                                               
and so CI > CB. By [3.2], I lies outside of C. Similarly, every other point on BI

                                                       
except B lies outside of the C. Hence, BI intersects touches C at B only.

Claim 2: BH cuts C.
Construct CG  BH. It follows that (BC)2 = (CG)2 + (GB)2. Therefore (BC)2 >
(CG)2, and so BC > CG. By [3.2], G must lie within C, and consequently if BG
is extended it must also intersect C at H and therefore cut it.
This completes the proof.

Proposition 3.17. TANGENTS ON CIRCLES I.

It is possible to construct a tangent of a given circle from a given point outside of
the circle.

Proof. Construct O and P such that P is outside of O. We wish to construct
tangent BP to O.

                                      Figure 3.2.21: [3.17] (), ()

Construct radius OC and extend OC to OP . With O as center and OP as radius,
construct the circle O1. Also construct CA  OP . Construct OA, intersecting O
at B, and construct BP . We claim that BP is the required tangent to O.

Since O is the center of O and O1, we find that OA = OP and OC = OB.
Consider AOC and P OB: OA = OP , OC = OB, and each shares BOC =
AOC = P OB. By [1.4], AOC = P OB, and so OCA = OBP .
But OCA is a right angle by construction; therefore OBP is a right angle, and
by [3.16], BP touches the circle O at B. By definition BP is a tangent of O at
point B, which proves our claim.

Proposition 3.18. TANGENTS ON CIRCLES II.

If a line touches a circle, the segment from the center of the circle to the point of
intersection with the line is perpendicular to the line.

                                           
Proof. Construct O with point C on its circumference, and also construct CD. We
       
claim that if CD touches O, then OC  CD.

                                           Figure 3.2.22: [3.18]

Suppose instead that another segment OG is constructed from the center such that
         

OG  CD where OG cuts the circle at F . Because the angle OGC is right by
hypothesis, the angle OCG must be acute [1.17]. By [1.19], OC > OG. But OG =

                                                                                                     
OF  F G and OC = OF , and so OC < OG, a contradiction. Hence OC  CD.

Alternatively:
                                                                                                       

Proof. Since the perpendicular must be the shortest segment from O to CD and
                                                                            

OC is evidently the shortest line, it follows that OC  CD.
3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III                   175

Proposition 3.19. TANGENTS ON CIRCLES III.

If a line is a tangent to a circle, then the perpendicular constructed from its point
of intersection passes through the center of the circle.

                                                                    
Proof. Suppose AB is tangent to  CDA. We claim that if AB  AC, then AC
contains the center of CDA.

                           Figure 3.2.23: [3.19]

Suppose otherwise: let O be the center of CDA and construct AO. Notice that
                             
OAC > 0. Because AB touches CDA and OA is constructed from the center to
                                 
the point of intersection, OA  AB by [3.18]. Since AB  AC by hypothesis, OAB

and CAB are right angles.

It follows that CAB = OAB and CAB = OAB + OAC; hence OAC = 0
and OAC > 0, a contradiction. Therefore, the center lies on AC.

Corollary. 3.19.1. If a number of circles touch the same line at the same point, the
locus of their centers is the perpendicular to the line at the point.

Corollary. 3.19.2. Suppose we have a circle and any two of the following properties:
      (a) a tangent to a circumference;
      (b) a segment, ray, or straight line constructed from the center of the circle to the

point of intersection;
      (c) right angles at the point of intersection.

Then by [3.16], [3.18], [3.19], and the Rule of Symmetry, the remaining property
follows. If we have (a) and (c), then it may be necessary to extend a given segment or
a ray to the center of the circle: these are limiting cases of [3.1, Cor. 1] and [3.3].
176  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Proposition 3.20. ANGLES AT THE CENTER OF A CIRCLE AND ON THE
CIRCUMFERENCE.

The angle at the center of a circle is double the angle at the circumference when
each stands on the same arc of the circumference.

Proof. Construct E with EB as radius, and construct BEC and BAC where A,
C, and D are points on the circumference of E. We claim that BEC = 2·BAC =
2 · BDC.

                                           Figure 3.2.24: [3.20]

Construct AEF , and consider EAB: since EA = EB, by [1.6] EAB = EBA
and therefore EAB + EBA = 2 · EAB. Since BEF = EAB + EBA by
[1.32], BEF = 2 · EAB. Similarly in EAC, F EC = 2 · EAC. It follows that

              BEC = BEF + F EC = 2 · (EAB + EAC) = 2 · BAC

Now construct GD, BD, and CD. By an argument similar to the above, we can
prove that GEC = 2 · EDC and GEB = 2 · EDB. Since BEC = GEC -
GEB, we find that

                           BEC = 2 · (EDC - EDB) = 2 · BDC

which completes the proof.

Proposition 3.21. ANGLES ON CHORDS.

In a circle, angles standing on the same arc are equal in measure to each other.

We claim that BAC = BDC.

                                           Figure 3.2.25: [3.21]

By [3.20], BEC = 2 · BAC = 2 · BDC, or BAC = BDC. This proves our
claim.

Proposition 3.22. QUADRILATERALS INSCRIBED INSIDE CIRCLES.

The sum of the opposite angles of a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle equals two
right angles.

Proof. Construct quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in E. We claim that the sum of
the opposite angles of ABCD equals two right angles.

                                           Figure 3.2.26: [3.22]

Let  radians = two right angles, and construct diameters AC and BD. Since
ABD and ACD stand on arc AD, ABD = ACD by [3.21]. Similarly, DBC =
DAC because they stand on arc DC. Hence

                                     ABC = ABD + DBC
                                                 = ACD + DAC

From this, we obtain
                        ABC + CDA = ACD + DAC + CDA

where the right-hand side of the equality is the sum of the interior angles of ACD.
Since this sum equals  radians by [1.32], ABC + CDA =  radians.
Similarly, DAB +BCD =  radians (mutatis mutandis), which proves our claim.

Two similar and unequal arcs cannot be constructed on the same side of the same

Since AB = CD, if AB is applied to CD such that the point A coincides with C
and the point B coincides with D, then the chord AB coincides with CD. Because
AEB  CF D, they must coincide at every point [3.23]. This proves our claim.

Corollary. 3.24.1. Since the chords are equal in length, they are congruent; there-
fore the arcs, being similar, are also congruent.

Proposition 3.25. CONSTRUCTION OF A CIRCLE FROM AN ARC.

Given an arc of a circle, it is possible to construct the circle to which the arc belongs.

Proof. Given an arc (ABC) of F , we wish to construct F .

                                           Figure 3.2.29: [3.25]

Take any three points A, B, C on arc ABC. Construct AB, BC. Bisect AB at D and
BC at E. Construct DF  AB and EF  BC. We claim that F , the intersection of
DF and EF , is the center of the required circle.
Because DF bisects and is perpendicular to AB, the center of the circle of which
ABC is an arc lies on DF [3.1, Cor. 1]. Similarly, the center of the circle of which
ABC is an arc lies on EF .
Since F is the intersection of DF and EF , our proof is complete.

Proposition 3.26. ANGLES AND ARCS I.

In equal circles, equal angles at the centers or on the circumferences stand upon
arcs of equal length.

Proof. Construct G and H with equal radii and with equal angles at the centers:

BGC in G and EHF in H. Also construct equal angles BAC in G where
A is on the circumference and EDF in H where D is on the circumference. We
claim that arc BKC = arc ELF .

                               Figure 3.2.30: [3.26]

Construct BC and EF and consider BGC and EHF : BG = EH, GC = HF , and
BGC = EHF . By [1.4], BGC = EHF , and so BC = EF .

By  [3.20],  BAC  =  1  · BGC  and  EDF  =  1  · EHF .  Since  BGC    =  E H F  by
                     2                      2

hypothesis, BAC = EDF . By [Def. 3.10], arc BAC  arc EDF . And by [3.24],

arc BAC = arc EDF .

By [Def. 3.1], G and H are equal in measure, and so arc BKC = arc ELF which
proves our claim.

Corollary. 3.26.1. If the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are equal, one of
its diagonals must be a diameter of the circumscribed circle.

Corollary. 3.26.2. Parallel chords in a circle intercept equal arcs.

Corollary. 3.26.3. If two chords intersect at any point within a circle, the sum of
the opposite arcs which they intercept is equal to the arc which parallel chords inter-
secting on the circumference intercept. If two chords intersect at any point outside
a circle, the difference of the arcs they intercept is equal to the arc which parallel
chords intersecting on the circumference intercept.

3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III        185

Proposition 3.27. ANGLES AND ARCS II.

In equal circles, angles at the centers or at the circumferences which stand on equal
arcs are equal in measure.

Proof. Construct G and H with equal radii and construct angles at the centers

(AOB, DHE) and at the circumferences (ACB, DF E) which stand on equal
arcs (AGB, DKE). We claim that AOB = DHE and ACB = DF E.

                                           Figure 3.2.31: [3.27]

Consider the angles at the centers (AOB, DHE). Suppose that AOB > DHE
and that AOL = DHE. Since the circles are equal in all respects, arc AGL =
arc DKE [3.26]. Notice that arc LB > 0.

But arc AGB = arc DKE by hypothesis. Hence arc AGB = arc AGL and arc AGB =
arc AGLarc LB where arc LB = 0, a contradiction. A corresponding contradiction
follows if we assume that AOB < DHE. Therefore, AOB = DHE.
Now consider the angles at the circumference. Since 2 · ACB = AOB and 2 ·
DF E = DHE by [3.20], ACB = DF E. This completes the proof.
186                                   CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Proposition 3.28. CHORDS AND ARCS I.

In equal circles, chords of equal length divide the circumferences into arcs, and
these arcs are respectively equal.

Proof. Construct equal circles ( O, H) with equal chords (AB, DE). We claim
that AB and DE divide the circumferences of O and H, respectively, so that arc
AGB = arc DKE and arc ACB = arc DF E.

                                           Figure 3.2.32: [3.28]

If the equal chords are diameters, all arcs are equal semicircles, which completes
the proof.
Otherwise, construct AO, OB, DH, and HE. Because the circles are equal in all
respects, their radii are equal [Def. 3.1].
Consider AOB and DHE: AO = DH, OB = HE, and AB = DE. By [1.8],
AOB = DHE; hence AOB = DHE, and so arc AGB = arc DKE [3.26].
Since the whole circumference AGBC is equal in measure to the whole circumfer-
ence DKEF , it follows that arc ACB = arc DF E. This proves our claim.
3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III                            187

Proposition 3.29. CHORDS AND ARCS II.

In equal circles, equal arcs stand opposite equal chords.

Proof. Construct equal circles O and H where arc AGB = arc DKE. We claim
that AB = DE.

                                           Figure 3.2.33: [3.29]

Construct AO, OB, DH, and HE. Because the circles are equal in measure, the
angles AOB and DHE at the centers which stand on the equal arcs AGB and
DKE are themselves equal [3.27].
Consider AOB and DHE: AO = DH, OB = HE, and AOB = DHE. By
[1.4], AOB = DHE. Therefore, AB = DE, which proves our claim.

Corollary. 3.29.1. Propositions [3.26]-[3.29] are related in the following sense: in
circles with equal radius,

   1. In [3.26], equal angles imply equal arcs.
   2. In [3.27], equal arcs imply equal angles. Together, [3.26] and [3.27] state that
equal angles and equal arcs are equivalent.
   3. In [3.28], equal chords imply equal arcs.
   4. In [3.29], equal arcs imply equal chords. Together, [3.28] and [3.29] state that
equal chords and equal arcs are equivalent.
Or: in circles with equal radius, equal chords  equal angles  angles stand
on equal arcs.

Remark. Since the two circles in the four last propositions are equal, they are con-
gruent figures, and the truth of the propositions is made evident by superposition.

Proposition 3.30. BISECTING AN ARC.
Proof. We wish to bisect the given arc ACB.

                                           Figure 3.2.34: [3.30]

Construct the chord AB and bisect it at D. Construct DC  AB, intersecting the
arc at C. We claim that arc ACB is bisected at C.
Construct AC and BC, and consider ADC and BDC: AD = DB, they share
side DC, and ADC = BDC. By [1.4], ADC = BDC, and so AC = BC.
By [3.28], arc AC = arc BC; since arc ACB = arc AC  arc BC, arc ACB is bisected
at C.

Exercises.

1. Suppose that ABCD is a semicircle with diameter AD and a chord BC. Extend
--                --
BC to BC and AD to AD, and suppose each ray intersects at E. Prove that if CE is

equal in length to the radius of ABCD, then arc AB = 3 · CD. [See the final chapter

for a solution.]

2. The internal and the external bisectors of the vertical angle of a triangle in-
scribed in a circle meet the circumference again at points equidistant from the

3. If A is one of the points of intersection of two given circles and two chords ACD,
ACD are constructed, cutting the circles in the points C, D, C, and D, then
the triangles BCD, BCD formed by joining these to the second point B of
intersection of the circles are equiangular.

4. If the vertical angle ACB of a triangle inscribed in a circle is bisected by a
      

line CD which meets the circle again at D, and from D perpendiculars DE, DF are
constructed to the sides, one of which is extended, prove that EA = BF and hence
that CE = 12 (AC + BC).
3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III     189

Proposition 3.31. THALES' THEOREM.

In a circle,

   (1) if a circle is divided into two semicircles, then the angle contained in either
arc is a right angle;

   (2) if a circle is divided into two unequal arcs and an angle is contained in the
larger of the two arcs, then the angle contained in that arc is an acute angle;

   (3) if a circle is divided into two unequal arcs and an angle is contained in the
smaller of the two arcs, then the angle contained in that arc is an obtuse angle.

Proof. Construct O, diameter AB, and points C, D, and E such that C and D are
on one semicircle and E is on the other semicircle. We claim that:

   (1) ACB in arc ACB is a right angle;
   (2) ACE in arc ACE is an acute angle.
   (3) ACD in arc ACD is an obtuse angle.

                                           Figure 3.2.35: [3.31]

Claim 1: ACB in arc ACB is a right angle;
                                                         -

Construct radius OC and extend AC to AC. Consider AOC: since AO = OC,
ACO = OAC. Similarly in OCB, OCB = CBO. Hence,

                                     ACB = ACO + OCB
                                                 = OAC + CBO
                                                 = BAC + CBA

Consider ABC: by [1.32], F CB = BAC + CBA. Hence, ACB = F CB
where each are adjacent angles; thus, ACB is a right angle.
190  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Claim 2: ACE in arc ACE is an acute angle.

Construct CE. Since ACB = ACE + BCE, ACB > ACE. But we have
proven that ACB is a right angle; thus, ACE is acute.

                                           Figure 3.2.36: [3.31]

Claim 3: ACD in arc ACD is an obtuse angle;
Construct CD. Since ACD = ACB + BCD, ACD > ACB. Since ACB is a
right angle, ACE is obtuse.

Corollary. 3.31.1. If a parallelogram is inscribed in a circle, its diagonals intersect
at the center of the circle.

Corollary. 3.31.2. [3.31] holds if arcs are replaced by chords of appropriate
length, mutatis mutandis.

Proposition 3.32. TANGENT-CHORD ANGLES RELATED TO ANGLES ON THE
CIRCUMFERENCE WHICH STAND ON THE CHORD.

If a line is tangent to a circle, and from the point of intersection a chord is con-
structed cutting the circle, the angles made by this chord with the tangent are
respectively equal to the angles in the alternate arcs of the circle.

                                
Proof. Construct EF such that EF is tangent to ABC at A. Construct chord AC;

notice that AC cuts ABC. We claim that the angles made by this chord with the

tangent are respectively equal to the angles in the alternate arcs of the circle. We

shall prove this in two cases.

                                Figure 3.2.37: [3.32]()

Case 1: We wish to show that ABC = F AC in figure ().

                                                         
Construct AB such that AB  EF . Also construct BC. Because EF is tangent to
                                  
ABC, AB is clearly constructed at A, and AB  EF , by [3.19] we find that AB

passes through the center of ABC. By [3.31], ACB is a right angle; since ABC
is a triangle, the sum of the two remaining angles, ABC +CAB, equals one right

angle.

Since BAF is a right angle by construction, ABC + CAB = BAF . From this
we obtain ABC = BAF - CAB = F AC, which proves the first case.
192  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Case 2: We wish to prove that CAE = CDA in figure ().

                                         Figure 3.2.38: [3.32]()

Take any point D on the arc AC. Since the quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in a
circle, the sum of the opposite angles ABC + CDA equals two right angles [3.22]
and is therefore equal to the sum F AC + CAE. However, ABC = F AC by
case 1. Hence, CDA = CAE.
This proves our second and last case, completing the proof.

Exercises.

1. If two circles touch, any line constructed through the point of intersection will
cut off similar segments.

2. If two circles touch and any two lines are constructed through the point of inter-
section (cutting both circles again), the chord connecting their points of intersection
with one circle is parallel to the chord connecting their points of intersection with
the other circle.

                                                            
3. Suppose that ACB is an arc of a circle, CE a tangent at C (meeting the chord
AB extended to E), and AD  AB where D is a point of AB. Prove that if DE be
bisected at C then the arc AC = 2 · CB.

4. If two circles touch at a point A and if ABC is a chord through A, meeting the
circles at points B and C, prove that the tangents at B and C are parallel to each
other, and that when one circle is within the other, the tangent at B meets the outer
circle at two points equidistant from C.

5. If two circles touch externally, their common tangent at either side stands oppo-
site a right angle at the point of intersection, and its square is equal to the rectangle
contained by their diameters.

Proposition 3.33. CONSTRUCTING A SEGMENT OF A CIRCLE ON A LINE
WHERE THE SEGMENT CONTAINS AN ANGLE EQUAL TO A GIVEN ANGLE.

  
Proof. Construct AB and HGF . On AB, we wish to construct a segment of a circle

which contains an angle equal to HGF .

                                           Figure 3.2.39: [3.33]

                                                                        
If HGF is a right angle, construct a semicircle on AB as our segment. By [3.31],
a semicircle contains a right angle.
Otherwise, construct BAE = HGF . Construct AC  AE and BC  AB. Let AC
be the diameter of ABC, which we claim is the required circle.
Notice that ABC has B on its circumference because ABC is a right angle [3.31].
Also, ABC touches AE because CAE is a right angle [3.16]. It follows that
BAE = ACB. Since BAE = HGF by construction, HGF = ACB.

            
Thus on AB, we have constructed a segment of ABC which contains an angle
equal to HGF .

Exercises.
1. Construct a triangle, being given the base, vertical angle, and any of the follow-
ing data:

      (a) a perpendicular.
      (b) the sum or difference of the sides.
      (c) the sum or difference of the squares of the sides.
      (d) the side of the inscribed square on the base.

      (e) the median that bisects the base.

2. If lines are constructed from a fixed point to all the points of the circumference
of a given circle, prove that the locus of all their points of bisection is a circle.

3. Given the base and vertical angle of a triangle, find the locus of the midpoint of
the line joining the vertices of equilateral triangles constructed on the sides.

4. In the same case, find the loci of the vertices of a square constructed on one of
the sides.

Proposition 3.34. CONSTRUCTING A SEGMENT OF A CIRCLE WHERE THE
SEGMENT CONTAINS AN ANGLE EQUAL TO A GIVEN ANGLE.

Proof. Construct ABC and HGF . We wish to construct a segment of  ABC
which contains an angle equal to HGF .

Choose point A on the circumference of ABC and construct the tangent AD. On

AD, construct DAC = HGF . We claim that segment AC of ABC is the re-
quired segment.

                                           Figure 3.2.40: [3.34]

Choose any point B on the circumference of ABC other than from the arc AC.
Construct AB and BC. By [3.32], DAC = ABC. But DAC = HGF by
construction, and so HGF = ABC.
Thus on ABC, we have constructed a segment of ABC which contains an angle
equal to HGF .

Proposition 3.35. AREAS OF RECTANGLES CONSTRUCTED ON CHORDS.

If two chords of a circle intersect at one point within the circle, then the area of the
rectangle contained by the divided segments of the first chord is equal in area to
the rectangle contained by the divided segments of the second chord [Def. 2.4].

Proof. Construct O with chords AB and CD which intersect at one point. We
claim that the rectangles contained by the divided segments are equal in area and
shall prove this claim in four cases.

                                      Figure 3.2.41: [3.35], case 1

Case 1: if the point of intersection is the center of O, AO = OB = DO = OC.
Hence, AO · OB = DO · OC.

                Figure 3.2.42: [3.35], case 2

Case 2: suppose that AB passes through O and that CD does not; also suppose
they intersect at E and that AB  CD.
Construct OC. Because AB is divided equally at O and unequally at E, by [2.5]

                                       AE · EB + (OE)2 = (OB)2

Since OB = OC,

                AE · EB + (OE)2 = (OC)2
196                                                 CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

But (OC)2 = (OE)2 + (EC)2 by [1.47], and therefore

     AE · EB + (OE)2 = (OE)2 + (EC)2
                 AE · EB = (EC)2

                                      Figure 3.2.43: [3.35], case 2
Because AB passes through the center and cuts CD, which does not pass through
the center at a right angle, AB bisects CD by [3.3]. So (EC)2 = CE · ED, and
therefore, AE · EB = CE · ED.

                                      Figure 3.2.44: [3.35], case 3
3. Construct diameter AB of O which cuts CD such that AB  CD.
Construct OC, OD, and OF  CD [1.11]. Since CD is cut at right angles by OF
where OF passes through O, CD is bisected at F [3.3] and divided unequally at E.
By [2.5], CE · ED + (F E)2 = (F D)2.
Adding (OF )2 to each side of the equality and applying [1.47], we obtain:

                        CE · ED + (F E)2 + (OF )2 = (F D)2 + (OF )2
                                     CE · ED + (OE)2 = (OD)2
                                     CE · ED + (OE)2 = (OB)2

Again, since AB is bisected at O and divided unequally at E, AE · EB + (OE)2 =
(OB)2 [2.5].

                                      Figure 3.2.45: [3.35], case 3

It follows that
                             CE · ED + (OE)2 = AE · EB + (OE)2
                                         CE · ED = AE · EB

4. Suppose neither chord passes through the center and they intersect at E.

                                      Figure 3.2.46: [3.35], case 4

Through E, construct diameter F G. By case 3, the rectangle F E · EG = AE · EB
and F E · EG = CE · ED. Hence, AE · EB = CE · ED.

Corollary. 3.35.1. If a chord of a circle is divided at any point within the circle, the
rectangle contained by its segments is equal to the difference between the square of
the radius and the square of the segment constructed from the center to the point of
section.

Corollary. 3.35.2. If the rectangle contained by the segments of one of two inter-
secting segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other, the
four endpoints are concyclic.
198  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Corollary. 3.35.3. If two triangles are equiangular, the rectangle contained by the
non-corresponding sides about any two equal angles are equal.

                                      Figure 3.2.47: [3.35], Cor. 3

Proof. Let ABO and DCO be the equiangular triangles, and let them be placed
so that the equal angles at O are vertically opposite and that the non-corresponding
sides, AO and CO, form segment CA. Then the non-corresponding sides BO, OD
form segment BD. Since ABD = ACD, the points A, B, C, D are concyclic [3.21,
Cor. 1]. Hence, AO · OC = BO · OD [3.35].

Exercises.
1. In any triangle, the rectangle contained by two sides is equal in area to the

2. The rectangle contained by the chord of an arc and the chord of its supplement

4. If the base and the difference of the sides is given, the rectangle contained by
the perpendiculars from the endpoints of the base on the internal bisector is given.

6. Consider the arc AB = AF + F B. The rectangle AF · F B is equal in area to
the rectangle contained by the radius and 2 · F I; that is, it is equal to the rectangle

arcs of a circle is greater than a semicircle, the rectangle contained by their chords
is equal to the rectangle contained by the radius, and the sum of the chords of the
supplements of their sum and their difference.

Proposition 3.36. THE AREA OF RECTANGLES CONSTRUCTED ON A TAN-
GENT AND A POINT OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE I.

Suppose we are given a circle and a point outside of the circle. If two segments
are constructed from the point to the circle, the first of which intersects the circle
at two points and the second of which is tangent to the circle, then the area of the
rectangle contained by the subsegments of the first segment is equal to the square
on the tangent.

Proof. Construct O and point P outside of O. Then construct P T tangent to O
at T ; also construct P A such that P A intersects the circle at B and again at A. We
claim that AP · BP = (P T )2. We prove this claim in two cases.

                                      Figure 3.2.49: [3.36], case 1

Case 1: P A passes through O.
Construct OT . Because AB is bisected at O and divided externally at P , the rect-
angle AP · BP + (OB)2 = (OP )2 [2.6].
Since P T is a tangent to O and OT is constructed from the center to the point
of intersection, the angle OT P is right [3.18]. Hence (OT )2 + (P T )2 = (OP )2 by
[1.47].
Therefore AP · BP + (OB)2 = (OT )2 + (P T )2. But (OB)2 = (OT )2, and so AP · BP =
(P T )2.
3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III       201

Case 2: P A does not pass through O.

                                      Figure 3.2.50: [3.36], case 2

Construct the perpendicular OC  AB; also construct OT , OB, OP . Because OC,
a segment through the center, cuts AB, which does not pass through the center at
right angles, OC bisects AB [3.3].
Since AB is bisected at C and divided externally at P , we find that AP · BP +
(CB)2 = (CP )2 [2.6]. Adding (OC)2 to each side, we obtain:

                         AP · BP + (CB)2 + (OC)2 = (CP )2 + (OC)2
                                     AP · BP + (OB)2 = (OP )2

We also have that (OT )2 + (P T )2 = (OP )2, from which it follows that

                                 AP · BP + (OB)2 = (OT )2 + (P T )2

Since OB = OT , (OB)2 = (OT )2, and so AP · BP = (P T )2.

Remark. The two propositions [3.35] and [3.36] may be written as one statement:
the rectangle AP · BP contained by the segments of any chord of a given circle
passing through a fixed point P , either within or outside of the circle, is constant.

Proof. Suppose O is the center the circle, and construct OA, OB, OP . Notice that
OAB is an isosceles triangle, and OP is a segment constructed from its vertex to
a point P in the base or the extended base.
It follows that the rectangle AP · BP is equal to the difference of the squares of OB
and OP ; therefore, it is constant.

Corollary. 3.36.1. If two segments AB, CD are extended to meet at P , and if the
rectangle AP · BP = CP · DP , then the points A, B, C, D are concyclic (compare
[3.35, Cor. 2]).
202  CHAPTER 3. CIRCLES

Corollary. 3.36.2. Tangents to two circles from any point in their common chord

rent (compare [3.17, #7]).

3.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK III  203

Proposition 3.37. THE AREA OF RECTANGLES CONSTRUCTED ON A TAN-
GENT AND A POINT OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE II.

Suppose we are given a circle and a point outside of the circle. If two segments are
constructed from the point to the circle, the first of which intersects the circle at
two points, and the area of the rectangle contained by the subsegments of the first
segment is equal to the square on the second segment, then the second segment is
tangent to the circle.

Proof. If the rectangle (AP · BP ) contained by the segments of a secant and con-
structed from any point (P ) outside of the circle ( O) is equal in area to the square
on the segment (P T ) constructed from the same point to meet the circle, we claim
that the segment which meets the circle is a tangent to that circle.

                                           Figure 3.2.51: [3.37]

From P , construct P Q touching O [3.17]. Construct OP , OQ, OT . By hypothesis,
AP · BP = (P T )2; by [3.36], AP · BP = (P Q)2. Hence (P T )2 = (P Q)2, and so
P T = P Q.
Consider the triangles OT P and OQP : each have OT = OQ, T P = QP , and
they share base OP in common. By [1.8], OT P = OQP , and so OT P = OQP .
But OQP is a right angle since P Q is a tangent [3.38]; hence OT P is right, and
therefore P T is a tangent to O [3.16].

Corollary. 3.37.1. Suppose we are given a circle and a point outside of the circle
where two segments are constructed from the point to the circle, the first of which
intersects the circle at two points. Then the second segment is tangent to the circle
if and only if the area of the rectangle contained by the subsegments of the first
segment is equal to the square on the tangent.

Inscription and
Circumscription

This chapter contains sixteen propositions: four relate to triangles, four to squares,
four to pentagons, and four to other figures.

4.1 Definitions

1. If two polygons are related such that the vertices of one lie on the sides of the
other, then:

      (a) the inner figure is said to be inscribed in the outer figure;
      (b) the outer figure is said to be circumscribed around or about the inner figure.
2. A polygon is said to be inscribed in a circle when all of its vertices intersect the
circumference. Reciprocally, a polygon is said to be circumscribed about or around
a circle when each of its sides touch the circle.

Figure 4.1.1: The hexagon is inscribed in the circle, and the circle is circumscribed
about the hexagon.
3. A circle is said to be inscribed in a polygon when it touches each side of the

figure. Reciprocally, a circle is said to be circumscribed about or around a polygon
when it passes through each vertex of the figure.

4. A polygon which is both equilateral and equiangular is said to be regular.

5. The bisectors of the three internal angles of a triangle are concurrent. Their
point of intersection is called the incenter of the triangle.

6. The circle from [4.5] is called the circumcircle, its radius the circumradius, and
its center the circumcenter of the triangle.

8. The nine-points circle is a circle that can be constructed for any given triangle.
It is so named because it passes through nine significant concyclic points defined
from the triangle. These nine points are:

      (a) the midpoint of each side of the triangle

      (b) the foot of each altitude

      (c) the midpoint of the line segment from each vertex of the triangle to the
orthocenter (where the three altitudes meet; these line segments lie on their re-
spective altitudes).1

4.2 Propositions from Book IV

Proposition 4.1. CONSTRUCTING A CHORD INSIDE A CIRCLE.

Construct an arbitrary circle and an arbitrary segment such that the segment is
less than or equal to the length of the diameter of the circle. It is possible to con-
struct a chord within the circle equal to the length of the segment.

Proof. Construct ABC with diameter AC and the segment DG  AC. We wish to
construct a chord in ABC equal in length to DG.

                                             Figure 4.2.1: [4.1]

If DG = AC, then the required chord already exists (the diameter of A).
If DG < AC, cut sub-segment AE from diameter AC such that AE = DG [1.3].
With A as center and AE as radius, construct the circle A, cutting the circle

  ABC at the points B and F .
Construct AB: we claim that AB is the required chord.
Notice that AB = AE. Since AE = DG by construction, AB = DG. Since AB is a
chord of ABC, the construction is complete.

Proposition 4.2. INSCRIBING A TRIANGLE INSIDE A CIRCLE.

In a given circle, it is possible to inscribe a triangle that is equiangular to a given
triangle.

Proof. We wish to inscribe a triangle equiangular to DEF in ABC.

                                             Figure 4.2.2: [4.2]

At A on the circumference of ABC, construct the tangent line GAH. Construct
HAC = DEF , GAB = DF E [1.23], and segment BC. We claim that ABC
fulfills the required conditions.

Since DEF = HAC by construction and HAC = ABC by [3.32], DEF =
ABC. Similarly, DF E = ACB. By [1.32], F DE = BAC.
This completes the construction.
216  CHAPTER 4. INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION

Proposition 4.3. CIRCUMSCRIBING A TRIANGLE ABOUT A CIRCLE.

It is possible to circumscribe a triangle about a circle such that the triangle is
equiangular to a given triangle.

Proof. We wish to to construct a triangle equiangular to DEF about O.

                                             Figure 4.2.3: [4.3]

Extend side DE of DEF to GH, and construct OA. Construct AOB = GEF
and AOC = HDF [1.23]. At the points A, B, and C, construct the tangents LM ,
M N , and N L to O. We claim that LM N fulfills the required conditions.

Because AM touches O at A, OAM is right [3.18]. Similarly, M BO is right; but
the sum of the four angles of the quadrilateral OAM B is equal to four right angles
[1.32, Cor. 3]. Therefore the sum of the two remaining angles AOB + AM B
equals two right angles.

By [1.13], GEF + F ED = two right angles, and so AOB + AM B = GEF +
F ED. But AOB = GEF by construction; hence AM B = F ED. Similarly,
ALC = EDF . By [1.32], BN C = DF E, and so LM N is equiangular to
DEF . This completes the construction.

Proposition 4.4. INSCRIBING A CIRCLE IN A TRIANGLE.

It is possible to inscribe a circle in a given triangle.

Proof. We wish to inscribe O in ABC.

                                             Figure 4.2.4: [4.4]

Bisect angles CAB and ABC of ABC with AO and BO, respectively. We claim
that O, their point of intersection, is the center of the required circle.

From O construct OD  CB, OE  AB, and OF  AC. Consider the triangles
OAE and OAF : OAE = OAF by construction; AEO = AF O since each is
right; each triangle shares side OA. By [1.26], OAE = OAF , and so OE = OF .

Similarly, OD = OF , and so OD = OE = OF . As a consequence of [3.9], the circle
constructed with O as center and OD as radius will intersect the points D, E, F .

Since each of the angles ODB, OEA, OF A is right, each segment touches the
respective sides of the triangle ABC [3.16]. Therefore, the circle O is inscribed
in the triangle ABC, which completes the construction.

Exercises.

1. In [4.4]: if OC is constructed, prove that ACB is bisected. Hence, the existence
of the incenter of a triangle is proven. [See the final chapter for a solution.]

2. If the sides BC, CA, AB of the triangle ABC are written as a, b, c, and half
the sum of their side-lengths is defined as s, prove that the distances of the vertices
A, B, and C of the triangle from the points of contact of the inscribed circle are
respectively s - a, s - b, s - c.

Proposition 4.5. CIRCUMSCRIBING A CIRCLE ABOUT A TRIANGLE.

It is possible to circumscribe a circle about a given triangle.

Proof. We wish to construct O about ABC.

                                             Figure 4.2.6: [4.5]

Bisect sides AC and BC of ABC at the points E and D, respectively. Construct
DO  BC and EO  CA. We claim that O, the point of intersection of the perpen-
dicular segments, is the center of the required circle.
Construct OA, OB, OC, and consider triangles BDO and CDO: sides BD = CD
by construction, the triangles share side DO in common, and BDO = CDO
because each is right. By [1.4], BDO = CDO, and so BO = OC.
Similarly, AO = OC, and so AO = BO = CO. As a consequence of [3.9], a circle can
be constructed with O as its center and OA as its radius such that the circumference

  O will pass through A, B, and C. Thus O is circumscribed about the triangle
AB C .

Corollary. 4.5.1. Since the perpendicular from O to AB bisects AB by [3.3], we see
that the perpendiculars at the midpoints of the sides of a triangle are concurrent.
(See also [Def. 4.7].)

Proposition 4.6. INSCRIBING A SQUARE IN A CIRCLE.
It is possible to to inscribe a square in a given circle.
Proof. We wish to inscribe the square ABCD in O.

                                             Figure 4.2.9: [4.6]
Construct diameters AC and BD such that AC  BD. Also construct AB, BC, CD,
and DA. We claim that ABCD is the required square.
Notice that the four angles at O are equal since they are right angles. Hence the
arcs on which they stand are equal [3.26] and the four chords on which they stand
are equal in length [3.29]. Therefore the figure ABCD is equilateral.
Again, since AC is a diameter, the angle ABC is right [3.31]. Similarly, the re-
maining angles are right. It follows that ABCD is a square inscribed in O,
which completes the construction.
222  CHAPTER 4. INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION

Proposition 4.7. CIRCUMSCRIBING A SQUARE ABOUT A CIRCLE.

It is possible to circumscribe a square about a given circle.

Proof. We wish to construct the square EHGF about O.

                                            Figure 4.2.10: [4.7]

Through O construct diameters AC and BD such that AC  BD, and at the points
A, B, C, and D construct the tangential segments HE = EF = F G = GH. We
claim that EF GH is the required square.
Since AE touches the circle at A, the angle EAO is right [3.18] and therefore
equal to BOC, which is right by construction. Thus AE  OB and EB  AO.
Since AO = OB (both are radii of O), the figure HDOA is a rhombus. Since the
angle AOB is right, AOBE is a square.
Similarly, each of the figures OCF B, DGCO, and HDOA is a square. Simi-
larly to the above, EHGF is also a square circumscribed about O, which com-
pletes the construction.

Corollary. 4.7.1. The circumscribed square, EHGF , has double the area of the
inscribed square, BCDA.

Exercises.
1. Prove [Cor. 4.7.1]. [See the final chapter for a solution.]
4.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IV                          223

Proposition 4.8. INSCRIBING A CIRCLE IN A SQUARE.

It is possible to inscribe a circle in a given square.

Proof. We wish to inscribe O in EHGF .

                                            Figure 4.2.11: [4.8]

Bisect adjacent sides EH and EF at A and B, respectively. Through A and B,
construct AC  EH and BD  EF . We claim that O, the point of intersection of
these parallel segments, is the center of the required circle, O.

Because EAOB is a parallelogram, its opposite sides are equal; therefore OA =
EB. But EB is half the side of EHGF , and so OA = half of the side of EHGF .
This is also true for each of the segments OB, OC, and OD, mutatis mutandis.
Hence

                                         OA = OB = OC = OD

As a consequence of [3.9], O is the center of O. And since these segments are
perpendicular to the sides of the given square, the circle constructed with O as
center and OA as radius is inscribed in the square. This completes the construction.
224  CHAPTER 4. INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION

Proposition 4.9. CIRCUMSCRIBING A CIRCLE ABOUT A GIVEN SQUARE.

It is possible to circumscribe a circle about a given square.

Proof. We wish to construct O about ABCD.

                                            Figure 4.2.12: [4.9]

Construct perpendicular diagonals AC and BD intersecting at O. We claim that O
is the center of the required circle.

Consider ABD and CBD: since ABCD is a square, DA = AB = BC = CD.
The triangles share side BD. By [1.8], ABD = CBD, and so ABD = CBD.
Since ABC = ABD + CBD, ABC is bisected by BD. Similarly, we can prove
that ADC is bisected by BD and that DAB and BCD are bisected by AC.

Since ABCD is a square, ABC = BCD = CDA = DAB, and so ABO =
CBO = BCO = DCO = CDO = ADO = DAO = BAO.

Consider ABO and CBO: ABO = CBO by the above, they share side OB,
and AB = BC by the above. By [1.4], ABO = CBO. Also notice that BAO =
ABO = CBO = BCO, and so each triangle is isosceles. By [1.6], AO = BO =
CO.

As a consequence of [3.9], O is the center of O with radius = OA which intersects
B, C, and D and is clearly constructed about the square ABCD. This completes
the construction.

Proposition 4.10. CONSTRUCTION OF AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE WITH BASE
ANGLES DOUBLE THE VERTICAL ANGLE.

It is possible to construct an isosceles triangle such that each base angle is double
the vertical angle.

Proof. We wish to construct an isosceles triangle ABD such that
                                     DBA = 2 · DAB = BDA

                                           Figure 4.2.13: [4.10]

                                                                           ( )2
Construct AB and divide it at C such that AB · BC = AC [2.6].
With A as center and AB as radius, construct A; on its circumference construct
BD = AC [4.1]. Also construct AD. We claim that ABD fulfills the required
conditions.
Construct CD and the circle ACD about ACD [4.5].

                                         ( )2
Since BD = AC, AB · BC = BD . Notice that B is outside of ACD. By [3.37]
BD is tangent to ACD. By [3.32], BDC = DAC, and so

                          CDA + BDC = BDA = CDA + DAC

By [1.32], BCD = CDA + DAC, and so BDA = BCD.
Since AB = AD, by [1.5] BDA = BCD = CBD.
Since CBD = BCD, by [1.6] BD = DC. Hence BD = DC = AC.
Again from [1.5], CDA = DAC, and so CDA + DAC = 2 · DAC.
By the above, BCD = CDA + DAC, and so BCD = 2 · DAC = 2 · DAB.
Since BCD = CBD = DBA, DBA = 2 · DAB.
Since BDA = BCD, DBA = 2 · DAB = BDA, which completes the con-
struction.
226  CHAPTER 4. INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION

Exercises.

1. Prove that ACD is an isosceles triangle whose vertical angle is equal to three
times each of the base angles. [See the final chapter for a solution.]

2. Prove that BD is the side of a regular decagon inscribed in the circle BDE.

3. If DB, DE, and EF are consecutive sides of a regular decagon inscribed in a
circle, prove that BF - BD = radius of a circle.

4. If E is the second point of intersection of the circle ACD with BDE, prove
that DE = DB. If AE, BE, CE, and DE are constructed, then triangles ACE
and ADE are each congruent with ABD.

5. Prove that AC is the side of a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle ACD,
and EB the side of a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle BDE.

6. Since ACE is an isosceles triangle, (EB)2 - (EA)2 = AB · BC = (BD)2; that
is, prove that the square of the side of a pentagon inscribed in a circle exceeds the
square of the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle by the square of the
radius.
4.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IV                                    227

Proposition 4.11. INSCRIBING A REGULAR PENTAGON IN A GIVEN CIR-
CLE.

It is possible to inscribe a regular pentagon in a given circle.

Proof. We wish to inscribe a regular pentagon in ABC.

                                           Figure 4.2.14: [4.11]

Construct any isosceles triangle having each base angle equal to double the vertical
angle [4.10], and then construct ABD equiangular to that triangle such that it is
inscribed in ABC [4.4].
Bisect the angles DAB and ABD by constructing AC and BE, respectively. Also
construct EA, ED, DC, and CB. We claim that the figure ABCDE is a regular
pentagon.
Since DAB = ABD = 2 · ADB by construction, AC bisects DAB, and BE
bisects ABD, and so

                         BAC = CAD = ADB = DBE = EBA

By [Cor. 3.29.1], the chords on which these angles stand are equal in length:

                                     AB = BC = CD = DE = EA
Hence ABCDE is equilateral.
Again, because the arcs AB and DE are equal in length, if we add the arc BCD to
both, then the arc ABCD is equal in length to the arc BCDE, and therefore the
angles AED, BAE which stand on them are equal [3.27].
Similarly, it can be shown that all of these angles are equal; therefore ABCDE is
equiangular and a regular pentagon; this proves our claim.
228  CHAPTER 4. INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION

2. If the alternate sides of a regular pentagon are extended to intersect, the five

3. Prove that every two consecutive diagonals of a regular pentagon divide each
other in the extreme and mean ratio [2.11].
4. Being given a side of a regular pentagon, construct it.
5. Divide a right angle into five equal parts.
4.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IV                                           229

Proposition 4.12. CIRCUMSCRIBING A REGULAR PENTAGON ABOUT A GIVEN
CIRCLE.

It is possible to circumscribe a regular pentagon about a given circle.

Proof. We wish to construct a regular pentagon about O.

                                           Figure 4.2.15: [4.12]

Use [4.11] to inscribe a regular pentagon inside O with vertices at points A, B, C,
D, and E; at these points, construct equal tangential segments F G, GH, HI, IJ,
and JF . We claim that F GHIJ is the required circumscribed regular pentagon.

Construct OE, OA, and OB. Because the angles OAF and OEF of the quadri-
lateral AOEF are right angles [3.18], the sum of the two remaining angles AOE +
AF E equals two right angles. Similarly, the sum AOB + AGB equals two right
angles; hence AOE +AF E = AOB +AGB. But AOE = AOB because they
stand on equal segments AE and AB [3.27]. Hence AF E = AGB. Similarly, the
remaining angles of the figure F GHIJ are equal, and so F GHIJ is equiangular.

Now construct OF and OG and consider EOF and AOF : AF = F E [3.17, #1],
the triangles share side F O, and AO = EO since each are radii of O. By [1.8],
EOF = AOF , and so AF O = EF O; or, AF E is bisected at F .

Since AF E = AF O + EF O = 2 · AF O, it follows that AF O = 12 AF E.
Similarly, AGO = 21 AGB.

Consider AF O and AGO: AF E = AGB implies that AF O = AGO;
F AO = GAO since each are right angles; finally, each shares side AO. By [1.26],
AF O = AGO, and so AF = AG.

As a consequence, GF = 2 · AF ; similarly, JF = 2 · EF . And since AF = EF ,
GF = JF , and so on for all remaining sides. Therefore, F GHIJ is equilateral and
equiangular; thus, it is a regular pentagon, which proves our claim.
230  CHAPTER 4. INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION

Remark. This proposition is a particular case of the following general theorem
(which has an analogous proof): "If tangents are constructed on a circle at the ver-
tices of an inscribed regular polygon with a finite number of sides, they will form a
regular polygon with the same number of sides circumscribed to the circle."
4.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IV                                     231

Proposition 4.13. INSCRIBING A CIRCLE IN A REGULAR PENTAGON.

It is possible to inscribe a circle in a regular pentagon.

Proof. We wish to inscribe O in regular pentagon ABCDE.

                                Figure 4.2.16: [4.13]

Bisect two adjacent angles JAF and F BG by constructing AO and BO, respec-
tively; we claim that the point of intersection of the bisectors, O, is the center of the

required circle.

Construct CO as well as perpendiculars from O to the five sides of the pentagon.

Consider ABO and CBO: AB = BC by hypothesis, ABO = CBO by con-

struction, and each shares side BO. By [1.4] ABO = CBO, and so BAO =

B C O;  however,  BAO  =  1  ·  BAE  by  construction.  Therefore
                          2

                       BCO = 1 · BAE = 1 · BCD
                                2        2

Hence CO bisects the angle BCD. Similarly, we can show that DO bisects HDI
and that EO bisects IEJ.

Consider BOF and BOG: OF B = OGB since each are right, OBF =
OBG because OB bisects ABC by construction, and each shares side OB. By
[1.26], BOF = BOG, and so OF = OG.

Similarly, all the perpendiculars from O to the sides of the pentagon are equal. By
[3.9], the circle whose center is O with radius OF is inscribed in regular pentagon
ABCDE, which completes the construction.
232  CHAPTER 4. INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION

Proposition 4.14. CIRCUMSCRIBING A CIRCLE ABOUT A REGULAR PEN-
TAGON.

It is possible to circumscribe a circle about a regular pentagon.

Proof. We wish to construct O about regular pentagon ABCDE.

                                           Figure 4.2.17: [4.14]

Bisect adjacent angles BAE by AO and ABC by BO. We claim that O, the point
of intersection of the bisectors, is the center of the required circle.

Similarly, construct OC, OD, and OE. Consider ABO and CBO: AB = BC and
ABO = CBO by construction, and the triangles share BO in common. By [1.4],
ABO = CBO, and so BAO = BCO.
But BAE = BCD since ABCDE is a regular pentagon. Since BAO = 12 BAE
by construction, BCO = 12 BCD; hence, CO bisects BCD. Similarly, it can be
shown that DO bisects CDE and EO bisects DEA.
Because EAB = ABC, it follows that OAB = OBA. Consider OBA: by
[1.4], OA = OB. Similarly, we can show that

                                     OA = OB = OC = OD = OE

By [3.9], O is the center of a circle with radius OA which passes through points
B, C, D, and E, and is constructed about the regular pentagon ABCDE. This
completes the construction.
4.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IV                               233

Proposition 4.15. INSCRIBING A REGULAR HEXAGON IN A CIRCLE.
It is possible to inscribe a regular hexagon in a circle.

Proof. We wish to to inscribe regular hexagon ABCDEF in O.

                                           Figure 4.2.18: [4.15]

Take a point A on the circumference of O and construct AO. With A as center and
AO as radius, construct the circle A, intersecting O at the points B and F .
Construct OB and OF ; extend AO to intersect A at D, extend BO to intersect A
at E, and extend F O to intersect A at C. Also construct AB, BC, CD, DE, EF ,
and F A; we claim that hexagon ABCDEF is the required hexagon.
Notice that OA = OB since each are radii of O. Similarly, AB = OA since each
are radii of A. Hence, OA = OB = AB, and so OAB is equilateral.
Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is two right angles and equilateral
triangles have equal angles, AOB = OBA = OAB.
Mutatis mutandis, we can show that

                   AOB = AOF = F OE = EOD = DOC = BOC

By [Cor. 3.29.1], AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = F A and so hexagon ABCDEF is
equilateral.
Also OA = OB = OC = OD = OE = OF since each are radii of O. By [1.8], each
sub-triangle of hexagon ABCDEF is congruent. It follows that

                   ABC = BCD = CDE = DEF = EF A = F AB

and so ABCDEF is equiangular. This completes the construction.

Remark. [4.13] and [4.14] are particular cases of the following theorem: "A regular
polygon of any finite number of sides has one circle inscribed in it and another
constructed about it, and both circles are concentric."
234  CHAPTER 4. INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION

Corollary. 4.15.1. The length of the side of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle

4.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IV                                                                    235

Proposition 4.16. INSCRIBING A REGULAR FIFTEEN-SIDED POLYGON IN
A GIVEN CIRCLE.

It is possible to inscribe a regular fifteen-sided polygon in a given circle.

Proof. We wish to inscribe a regular fifteen-sided polygon in O.

                                     Figure 4.2.19: [4.16]

Inscribe a regular pentagon ABCDE in the circle O [4.11] as well as an equilat-
eral triangle AGH [4.2]. Construct CG. We claim that CG is a side of the required
polygon.

Since  AB C DE  is  a  regular  pentagon,  the  arc  ABC   is  2   of  the  circumference.
                                                               5

Since  AGH  is  an     equilateral  triangle,  the  arc  ABG   is  1   of  the  circumference.
                                                                   3

Hence  arc  GC  is  the  difference  between   these  two  arcs    and     equal  to  2  -  1  =  1   of
                                                                                      5     3     15

the circumference.

Therefore, if chords equal in length to GC are similarly constructed [4.1], we have
a regular fifteen-sided polygon (i.e., a quindecagon) inscribed in O.

Remark. Until 1801, no regular polygon was constructible by segments and circles
only except those described in Book IV of Euclid and those obtained by the contin-
ued bisection of the arcs of which their sides are chords. Then, Gauss proved that
if 2n + 1 is a prime number, regular polygons with 2n + 1 sides are constructible by
elementary geometric methods.

Chapter 5

Theory of Proportions

Chapter 5, like Chapter 2, proves a number of propositions that are familiar in the
form of algebraic equations. Like Book II, Book V appears in truncated form.

5.1 Definitions

0. Variables a, b, c, x, y, ... represent positive real numbers unless stated otherwise.

1. Let x and y be two positive integers where x < y. We say that x is a factor of y
when there exists a positive integer n  1 such that nx = y. We also say that y is a
multiple of x.

2. Suppose that x and y are two positive integers such that x = 0. A ratio is the

number  y  which  may  also  be  written  as  y  :  x.
        x

3. Numbers are said to have a ratio to one another when the lesser number can be
multiplied so as to exceed the greater.

4. Numbers which have the same ratio are called proportions. When four numbers
are proportions, it may be described as: "The first is to the second as the third is to
the fourth." Or:

                                                     ac
                                                        =

                                                     bd
The above equality may also be written as a : b = c : d.

5. Inequalities of fractions:

                       (a c)     (        ad bc         )

                       b > d  bd > bd  (ad > bc)

The symbol > may be replaced with , <, and . Numbers which have the same
ratio are called proportional.

6. Proportions consist of at minimum three terms.

242                                         CHAPTER 5. THEORY OF PROPORTIONS

Remark. This definition has the same fault as some of the others: it is not a defini-
tion but an inference. It occurs when the means in a proportion are equal, and so
there are four terms. As an example, take the numbers 4, 6, 9. Here the ratio of
4 : 6 is 2/3, and the ratio of 6 : 9 is 2/3; therefore 4, 6, 9 are continued proportionals.
But, in reality, there are four terms: the full proportion is 4 : 6 = 6 : 9.

7. The duplicate ratio is a compound ratio of two equal ratios. Algebraically, the
duplicate ratio of x : y is x2 : y2. (The duplicate ratio of 2 : 5 is 4 : 25.)

John Casey updates Euclid's definition of the duplicate ratio of two lines: the ratio
of the squares constructed on these segments.

8. The triplicate ratio is a compound ratio of three equal ratios. Algebraically, the
triplicate ratio of x : y is x3 : y3. (The triplicate ratio of 2 : 5 is 8 : 125.)

9. Harmonic division of a segment AB means identifying two points C and D such

that  AB  is  divided  internally  and  externally  in  the  same  ratio  CA  =  DB DA .
                                                                          CB

Figure 5.1.1: Here, the ratio is 2. Specifically, the distance AC is one unit, the
distance CB is half a unit, the distance AD is three units, and the distance BD is
1.5 units.

Harmonic division of a line segment is reciprocal: if points C and D divide the

segment AB harmonically, the points A and B also divide the line segment CD

harmonically.  In  that  case,  the  ratio  is  given  by  BC  =  AC  which   equals      one-third
                                                           BD     AD

in the example above.1

5.2 Propositions from Book V

Proposition 5.1. If any number of numbers are each the same multiple of the same
number of other numbers, then the sum is that multiple of the sum.

Corollary. 5.1.1. [5.1] is equivalent to kx + ky = k(x + y).

Proposition 5.2. If a first number is the same multiple of a second that a third is
of a fourth, and a fifth also is the same multiple of the second that a sixth is of the
fourth, then the sum of the first and fifth also is the same multiple of the second that
the sum of the third and sixth is of the fourth.

Corollary. 5.2.1. [5.2] is equivalent to the following: if kv = x, kw = r, mv = y, and
mw = u, then x + y = (k + m)v and r + u = (k + m)w.

Proposition 5.3. If a first number is the same multiple of a second that a third is
of a fourth, and if equimultiples are taken of the first and third, then the numbers
taken also are equimultiples respectively, the one of the second and the other of the
fourth.

Corollary. 5.3.1. [5.3] is equivalent to the following: Let A = kB and C = kD. If
EF = mA and GM = mC, then EF = mkB and GH = mkD.

Proposition 5.4. If a first number has to a second the same ratio as a third to a
fourth, then any equimultiples whatever of the first and third also have the same
ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively, taken in
corresponding order.

Corollary.  5.4.1.  [5.4] is equivalent to:  if  A  =k  =  C  ,  then  A  =  kB  and C  = kD.
                                                 B         D

Proposition 5.5. If a number is the same multiple of a number that a subtracted
part is of a subtracted part, then the remainder also is the same multiple of the
remainder that the whole is of the whole.

Corollary. 5.5.1. [5.5] is equivalent to: if x + y = k(m + n) and x = km, then y = kn.

Proposition 5.6. If two numbers are equimultiples of two numbers, and any num-
bers subtracted from them are equimultiples of the same, then the remainders either
equal the same or are equimultiples of them.

Corollary. 5.6.1. [5.6] is equivalent to: if x + y = km, u + v = kn, x = lm, y = ln,
and all variables are positive, then y = (k - l)m and v = (k - l)n whenever k > l.
244                                   CHAPTER 5. THEORY OF PROPORTIONS

Proposition 5.7. Equal numbers have to the same the same ratio; and the same
has to equal numbers the same ratio.

Corollary. 5.7.1. If any numbers are proportional, then they are also proportional
inversely.

Corollary. 5.7.2. [5.7] is equivalent to: if a = b, then a : c = b : c, and c : a = c : b.

Proposition 5.8. Of unequal numbers, the greater has to the same a greater ratio
than the less has; and the same has to the less a greater ratio than it has to the
greater.

Corollary. 5.8.1. [5.8] is equivalent to: if AB > C and D > 0, then AB = C + k

where k > 0, and     AB   =  C +k  =  DC + Dk  >   CD .  It follows that         D  >     AB D , since all
                      D        D                                                 C

quantities are positive.

Proposition 5.9. Numbers which have the same ratio to the same equal one an-
other; and numbers to which the same has the same ratio are equal.

Corollary. 5.9.1. [5.9] is equivalent to: if A = kC and B = kC, then A = B.

Proposition 5.10. Of numbers which have a ratio to the same, that which has a
greater ratio is greater; and that to which the same has a greater ratio is less.

Corollary.  5.10.1.  [5.10] is equivalent to:  if  A  >     B  and C       > 0, then A > B.
                                                   C        C

Proposition 5.11. Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same
with one another.

Corollary.  5.11.1.  [5.11] is equivalent to:  if  A     =  C  and      C  =  E  ,  then  A  =  EF .  This
                                                   B        D           D     F           B

is the transitive property for fractions.

Proposition 5.12. If any number of numbers are proportional, then one of the an-
tecedents is to one of the consequents as the sum of the antecedents is to the sum of
the consequents.

Corollary.  5.12.1.  [5.12] is equivalent to:  if  x  =     y  =  z  ,  then
                                                   a        b     c

5.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK V                                                    245

Proposition 5.13. If a first number has to a second the same ratio as a third to a
fourth, and the third has to the fourth a greater ratio than a fifth has to a sixth, then
the first also has to the second a greater ratio than the fifth to the sixth.

Corollary. 5.13.1. [5.13] is equivalent to: if A = kB, C = kD, C = lD, E = jF and
l > j, then k = l and so k > j.

Proposition 5.14. If a first number has to a second the same ratio as a third has to
a fourth, and the first is greater than the third, then the second is also greater than
the fourth; if equal, equal; and if less, less.

Corollary. 5.14.1. [5.14] is equivalent to: if A = kB, C = kD, A > C, and k > 0,
then kB = A > C = kD and so B > D. If A < C and B < D, the result follows
mutatis mutandis.

Proposition 5.15. Parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples.

Corollary. 5.15.1. [5.15] is equivalent to: if AB = kC, DE = kF , and C = mF ,
then AB = kmF = mDE.

Proposition 5.16. If four numbers are proportional, then they are also proportional
alternately.

Corollary.  5.16.1.  [5.16] is equivalent to:  if  A  =  C  ,  then  A  =  BD .
                                                   B     D           C

Proposition 5.17. If numbers are proportional taken jointly, then they are also
proportional taken separately.

Corollary. 5.17.1. [5.17] is equivalent to: if x + y = ky, u + v = kv, and x = ly, then
ly + y = ky, or l + 1 = k. Thus u + v = (l + 1)v, or u = lv.

Proposition 5.18. If numbers are proportional taken separately, then they are also
proportional taken jointly.

Corollary. 5.18.1. [5.18] is equivalent to: if x = ky, u = kv, and x + y = ly, then
(k + 1)y = ly and so k + 1 = l and u + v = kv = (k + 1)v = lv.

Proposition 5.19. If a whole is to a whole as a part subtracted is to a part sub-
tracted, then the remainder is also to the remainder as the whole is to the whole.
246                                              CHAPTER 5. THEORY OF PROPORTIONS

Corollary. 5.19.1. If numbers are proportional taken jointly, then they are also
proportional in conversion.

Corollary. 5.19.2. [5.19] is equivalent to: if x + y = k(u + v) and x = ku, then
y = kv.

Remark. 5.19.3. If u : v, the [5.16] [5.17], [5.18], and [5.19] show the following
proportions to be equivalent2:

   1. u : v = x : y
   2. (u + v) : v = (x + y) : y
   3. (u + v) : u = (x + y) : x
   4. (u + v) : (x + y) = v : y
   5. (u + v) : (x + y) = u : x
   6. u : x = v : y

(2)-(5) also hold when + is replaced by -.

Proposition 5.20. If there are three numbers, and others equal to them in multi-
tude, which taken two and two are in the same ratio, and if the first is greater than
the third, then the fourth is also greater than the sixth; if equal, equal, and; if less,
less.

Corollary. 5.20.1. [5.20] is equivalent to: let A = kB, B = lC, D = kE, E = lF ,
and A > C. We wish to show that D > F .

Suppose  that  A  =  c  +  m,  m   >  0.  Then   A  =   klC,  D  =  klF ,  and   so  A  =  DF .
                                                                                     C

Now  A  >  1  since  A  >  C.  If  D  =   F,  A  =  1;  and  if  D  <  F,  A  <  1.  Hence,  D   >  F.
     C                                        C                            C

The remaining cases follow mutandis mutatis.

Proposition 5.21. If there are three numbers, and others equal to them in multi-
tude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, and the proportion of
them is perturbed, then, if the first number is greater than the third, then the fourth
is also greater than the sixth; if equal, equal; and if less, less.

Corollary. 5.21.1. The result of [5.21] is the same as the result [5.20].

5.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK V  247

Proposition 5.22. If there are any number of numbers whatever, and others equal
to them in multitude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, then
they are also in the same ratio.

Corollary. 5.22.1. [5.22] is equivalent to: if A = kB, B = lC, D = kE, and E = lF ,
then A = klC and D = klF .

Proposition 5.23. If there are three numbers, and others equal to them in multi-
tude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, and the proportion of
them be perturbed, then they are also in the same ratio.

Corollary. 5.23.1. The result of [5.23] is the same as the result of [5.22].

Proposition 5.24. If a first number has to a second the same ratio as a third has
to a fourth, and also a fifth has to the second the same ratio as a sixth to the fourth,
then the sum of the first and fifth has to the second the same ratio as the sum of the
third and sixth has to the fourth.

Corollary. 5.24.1. [5.24] is equivalent to: if x = km, u = kn, y = lm, and v = ln,
then x + y = km + lm = (k + l)m and u + v = kn + ln = (k + l)n.

Proposition 5.25. If four numbers are proportional, then the sum of the greatest
and the least is greater than the sum of the remaining two.

Corollary. 5.25.1. [5.25] is equivalent to: let x + y = k(u + v), k > 1, and x = ku.
Since x + y = ku + kv, y = kv; and since k > 1, y > v.

Applications of Proportions

Recall that we write GHI = JKL to indicate that the area of GHI equals the
area of JKL.
Similarly, if we wish to state that the area of ABC divided by the area of DEF
equals the area of GHI divided by the area of JKL, we may write either

                                             DEF ABC = JKL GHI

1. Similar polygons are polygons that have the same shape, or one that has the
same shape as the mirror image of the other. More precisely, one polygon can be
obtained from the other by uniformly scaling (enlarging or shrinking), possibly with
additional translation, rotation and reflection. This means that either object can
be re-scaled, re-positioned, and reflected so as to coincide precisely with the other
object.
A modern perspective of similarity is to consider polygons similar if one appears
congruent to the other when zoomed in or out at some level.1
Similar polygons agree in shape; if they also agree in size, then they are congruent.
If polygons A and B are similar, we will denote this as A  B.

      (a) When the shape of a figure is given, it is said to be given in species. Thus
a triangle whose angles are given is given in species. Hence, similar figures are of
the same species.

      (b) When the size of a figure is given, it is said to be given in magnitude, such
as a square whose side is of given length.

      (c) When the place which a figure occupies is known, it is said to be given in
position.

      (d) Any two equilateral triangles are similar.

2. A segment is said to be cut at a point in extreme and mean ratio when the whole
segment is to the greater segment as the greater segment is to the lesser segment.
This ratio is also referred to as the golden ratio.

The figure below illustrates the geometric relationship.

     Figure 6.1.1: The golden ratio

Expressed algebraically, for quantities a and b with a > b > 0,

        a + b a def
               = =

          ab

where the Greek letter phi ( or ) represents the golden ratio. Its value is:

        
        1+ 5
     =        = 1.6180339887 . . .
        2

The golden ratio also is called the golden mean or golden section (Latin: sectio au-
rea). Other names include medial section, divine proportion, divine section (Latin:
sectio divina), golden proportion, golden cut, and golden number.2

3. If three quantities of the same kind are in continued proportion, the middle
term is called a mean proportional between the other two. Numbers in continued
proportion are also said to be in geometrical progression.

4. If four quantities of the same kind are in continued proportion, the two middle
terms are called two mean proportionals between the other two.

5. The altitude of any figure is the length of the perpendicular from its highest
point to its base.

6. Two corresponding angles of two figures have the sides about them reciprocally
proportional when a side of the first is to a side of the second as the remaining side
of the second is to the remaining side of the first.

7. Similar figures are said to be similarly constructed upon given segments when
these segments are corresponding sides of the figures.

8. Corresponding points in the planes of two similar figures are such that segments
constructed from them to the vertices of the two figures are proportional to the
corresponding sides of the two figures. See Fig. 6.1.2.

9. The point O in Fig. 6.1.2 is called the center of similitude of the figures. It is also
called their double point.

10. Two polygons are said to be homothetic if they are similar and their correspond-
ing sides are parallel. If two polygons are homothetic, then the lines joining their
corresponding vertices meet at a point.3

11. The center of mean position of any number of points A, B, C, D, etc., is a point

which may be found as follows: bisect the segment joining any two points A, B at

G.  Join G to a third point C;     divide GC   at H      so that GH   =    1  · GC.  Join H    to a
                                                                           3

6.2 Propositions from Book VI

Proposition 6.1. PROPORTIONAL TRIANGLES AND PARALLELOGRAMS.

Triangles and parallelograms which have the same altitude have areas which are
proportional to their bases.

Proof. Construct ACB and ACD such that the triangles have the same alti-
tude; also construct EACB and AF DC each with the same height as the previ-
ously constructed triangles. We claim that

                       BC : CD = ACB : ACD = EACB : AF DC

        Figure 6.2.1: [6.1]

Extend BD in both directions to the H and L. Construct any finite number of
segments toward H, each equal in the length to BC: in this proof, we construct BG
and GH. Similarly, construct an equal number of segments which are equal in the
length to CD toward L. Also construct AG, AH, AK, and AL.

Since BC = BG = GH, by [1.38] ACB = ABG = AGH. Similarly, if CH =
k · BC (where k is a positive integer such that k > 1), ACH = k · ACB; and if
CL = m · CD (where m is a positive integer such that m > 1), ACL = m · ACD.

Finally, CH = n · CL (where n is a positive real number such that n > 0); again,
[1.38] implies that ACH = n · ACL. That is,

        CH = n = ACH
        CL  AC L

Hence,

        CH : CL = ACH : ACL    

        k · BC : m · CD = (k · ACB) : (m · ACD) 

        BC : CD = ACB : ACD

By [1.41], EACB = 2 · ACB and ACDF = 2 · ACD. Therefore
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI                                 253

                           2 · BC : 2 · CD = EACB : AF CD 
                                  BC : CD = EACB : AF CD

Clearly, ACB : ACD = EACB : AF CD, which completes the proof.
254  CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Proposition 6.2. PROPORTIONALITY OF SIDES OF TRIANGLES.

A segment within a triangle divides the sides of a triangle proportionally if and
only if the segment is constructed parallel to one of the sides of a triangle.

Proof. Construct ABC and DE where D is on AB and E is on AC. We claim that
DE  BC if and only if AD : DB = AE : EC.

                                             Figure 6.2.2: [6.2]

First, suppose that DE  BC. We claim that AD : DB = AE : EC.
Construct BE and CD, and consider BDE and CED: each shares base DE and
stands between the parallels BC and DE. By [1.37], BDE = CDE. By [5.7],
ADE : BDE = ADE : CDE.
By [6.1], ADE : BDE = AD : DB and ADE : CDE = AE : EC. Since
BDE = CDE, it follows that AD : DB = AE : EC.

Now suppose that AD : DB = AE : EC. We claim DE  BC.
By [6.1], AD : DB = ADE : BDE and AE : EC = ADE : CDE. Since
AD : DB = AE : EC by hypothesis, ADE : BDE = ADE : CDE.
By [5.9], BDE = CDE. These triangles also stand on the same base DE as well
as on the same side of DE. By [1.39], they stand between the same parallels, and
so DE  BC.

Exercise.
1. If two segments are cut by three or more parallels, the intercepts on one are
proportional to the corresponding intercepts on the other.
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI  255

Proposition 6.3. ANGLES AND PROPORTIONALITY OF TRIANGLES.

A line bisects an angle of a triangle if and only if the line divides the side opposite
the angle into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

                                          
Proof. Construct ABC and AD where D is a point on AC. We claim that AD
bisects BAC if and only if BD : DC = BA : AC.

                                             Figure 6.2.3: [6.3]

Suppose that AD bisects BAC of a triangle ABC. We claim that BD : DC =
BA : AC.

Construct CE such that CE  AD. Extend BA to intersect CE at E. Because BE
intersects the parallels AD and EC, BAD = AEC [1.29].
Because AC intersects the parallels AD and EC, ACE = DAC. By hypothesis,
DAC = BAD. Therefore, ACE = DAC = BAD = AEC. Consider ACE:
since ACE = AEC, by [1.6] AE = AC.
Again, because AD  EC, where EC is one of the sides of the triangle BEC, by
[6.2] BD : DC = BA : AE. Since AE = AC by the above, BD : DC = BA : AC.

Now suppose that BD : DC = BA : AC. We claim that BAC is bisected by AD.
Let the same construction be made as above. Because AD  EC, by [6.2] BA : AE =
BD : DC.

But BD : DC = BA : AC by hypothesis. By [5.11], it follows that BA : AE = BA :
AC, and so AE = AC by [5.9].

Consider ACE: by [Cor. 1.6.1], AEC = ACE. By [1.29], AEC = BAD and
ACE = DAC. Hence BAD = DAC.
Since BAC = BAD + DAC, it follows that BAC is bisected by AD. This
completes the proof.
256  CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Exercises.

1. If the segment AD bisects the external vertical angle CAE, prove that BA :
AC = BD : DC, and conversely.

     Figure 6.2.4: [6.3], #1

Hint: construct AE = AC. Also construct ED. Then the triangles ACD and
AED are evidently congruent; therefore the angle EDB is bisected, and hence
BA : AE = BD : DE and BA : AC = BD : DC by [6.3].

2. Prove #1 without using [6.3], and then prove [6.3] using #1.

3. Prove that the internal and the external bisectors of the vertical angle of a
triangle divide the base harmonically.

4. Prove that any segment intersecting the legs of any angle is cut harmonically by
the internal and external bisectors of the angle.

5. Prove that any segment intersecting the legs of a right angle is cut harmonically
by any two lines through its vertex which make equal angles with either of its sides.

6. If the base of a triangle is given in number and position and if the ratio of the
sides is also given, prove that the locus of the vertex is a circle which divides the
base harmonically in the ratio of the sides.
7. If a, b, c denote the sides of a triangle ABC, and D, D are the points where the
internal and external bisectors of A meet BC, then prove that

     DD = b2-c2 2abc

8. In the same case as #7, if E, E, F , F  are points similarly determined on the
sides CA, AB, respectively, prove that

     DD 1 + EE 1 + F F  1     =0
     DD a2 + EE b2 + F F  c2  =0
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI             257

Proposition 6.4. EQUIANGULAR TRIANGLES I.

In equiangular triangles, the sides about the equal angles are proportional where
the corresponding sides stand opposite the equal angles.

Proof. Let ABC and DCE be equiangular triangles where ABC = DCE,
BAC = CDE, and ACB = CED. We claim that BA : AC = CD : DE. (The
proof of the remaining cases will be analogous.)

                                             Figure 6.2.5: [6.4]

Place BC such that BE = BC  CE. Since ABC + ACB is less than two right
angles [1.17] and ACB = DEC, it follows that ABC + DEC is less than two
right angles. Hence when BA and DE are extended, they will intersect at F by
[Cor. 1.29.1].
By [1.28], since DCE = ABC, DC  F B; and since DEC = ACB, AC  F E.
Therefore F ACD is a parallelogram; by [1.34], F A = DC and AC = F D.
Consider F BE: since AC  F E, by [6.2] BA : AF = BC : CE. But AF = CD, and
so BA : CD = BC : CE. By [5.16], BA : BC = CD : CE.
Similarly, since CD  BF , by [6.2] BC : CE = F D : DE. But F D = AC, and so
BC : CE = AC : DE; or BC : AC = CE : DE.
Since BA : BC = CD : CE and BC : AC = CE : DE, by [5.22] BA : AC = CD : DE,
which proves our claim.

Corollary. 6.4.1. By [Def. 6.1], the triangles in [6.4] have been proved to be similar.
Therefore, equiangular triangles are similar.

2. If two circles intercept on any secant chords that have a given ratio, prove that

the ratio compounded of the direct ratio of the radii and the inverse ratio of the

6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI              259

Proposition 6.5. EQUIANGULAR TRIANGLES II.

If two triangles have proportional sides, then the triangles are equiangular with
the equal angles opposite the corresponding sides.

Proof. Construct ABC and DEF such that BA : AC = ED : DF and AC :
CB = DF : F E. We claim that:

   (1)ABC and DEF are equiangular;
   (2) equal angles stand opposite corresponding sides.

                                             Figure 6.2.6: [6.5]

At D and E, construct the angles EDG = BAC and DEG = ABC. By [1.32],
ABC and DEG are equiangular; by [6.4], BA : AC = ED : DG.
Since BA : AC = ED : DF by hypothesis, DG = DF . Similarly, EG = EF .
Consider EDF and EDG: DG = DF , each shares side ED, and EG = EF . By
[1.8], EDF = EDG, and so EDF and EDG are equiangular. But EDG is
equiangular to ABC by construction. Therefore, EDF is equiangular to ABC,
proving claim 1.
Since BAC stands between BA and AC, and EDF stands between ED and DF ,
we have also proven claim 2. This completes the proof.

Corollary. 6.5.1. Two triangles are equiangular if and only if the sides about
the equal angles are proportional where the corresponding sides stand opposite the
equal angles.
260  CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Remark. In [Def. 6.1], two conditions are laid down as necessary for the similitude
of polygons:

   (a) The equality of angles;

   (b) The proportionality of sides.

Now by [6.4] and [6.5], we see that if two triangles possess either condition, they
also possess the other. Triangles are unique in this respect. In all other polygons,
one of these conditions may exist without the other. Thus two quadrilaterals may
have their sides proportional without having equal angles, or vice verse.
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI               261

Proposition 6.6. EQUIANGULAR TRIANGLES III.

If two triangles contain an equal angle enclosed by proportional sides, then the
triangles are equiangular and have those angles equal which stand opposite to
their corresponding sides.

Proof. Construct ABC and DEF such that:
   (1) BAC = EDF
   (2) BA : AC = ED : DF

We claim that ABC and DEF are equiangular and have those angles equal
which stand opposite to their corresponding sides.

                                             Figure 6.2.7: [6.6]

Recreate the construction from [6.5]: by [6.4], BA : AC = ED : DG. By hypothesis,
BA : AC = ED : DF , and so DG = DF .
Because EDG = BAC by construction and BAC = EDF by hypothesis,
EDG = EDF .
Consider EDG and EDF : DG = DF , each shares side DE, and EDG =
EDF . By [1.4], EDF = EDG, and so EDF and EDG are equiangular.
But EDG is equiangular to BAC by construction, and so EDF is equiangular
to BAC.
Finally, ABC and DEF have equal angles which stand opposite to their corre-
sponding sides, which proves our claim.

Remark. As in the case of [6.4], an immediate proof of [6.6] can also be obtained
from [6.2].
262  CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Proposition 6.7. SIMILAR TRIANGLES I.

If two triangles each contain an equal angle, if the sides about two remaining angles
are proportional, and if the remaining angles are either both acute or not acute,
then the triangles are similar.

Proof. Construct ABC and DEF where BAC = EDF , AB : BC = DE : EF ,
and EF D and BCA are either both acute or not acute. We claim that ABC 
DEF .

                                             Figure 6.2.8: [6.7]

If ABC = DEF , then one angle must be greater than the other. Wlog, suppose
ABC > DEF such that ABG = DEF , from which it follows that EF D =
BGA.
Consider ABG and DEF : BAG = EDF and ABG = DEF . By [1.32],
ABG and DEF are equiangular. By [6.4], AB : BG = DE : EF .

Since AB : BC = DE : EF by hypothesis, BG = BC. Consider CBG: by the
above, the triangle is isosceles. By [1.5], BGC = BCG. By [Cor. 1.17.1], every
triangle has at least two acute angles, and so BGC and BCG are both acute.
Since BGC is acute, BGA is obtuse.
By hypothesis, EF D = BGA, and so EF D is obtuse; since BCG = BCA,
BCA is acute. However, EF D and BCA are either both acute or both obtuse
by hypothesis, a contradiction. Hence ABC = DEF . Since BAC = EDF by
hypothesis, by [1.32] ABC and EF D are equiangular.

Since AB : BC = DE : EF by hypothesis, ABC  DEF [6.4]. This proves our
claim.

Corollary. 6.7.1. If ABC and DEF each have two sides proportional to two
sides in the other triangle, then AB : BC = DE : EF , the angles at points A and D
opposite one pair of corresponding sides are equal, and the angles at points C and
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI  263

F opposite the other are either equal or supplemental. This proposition is nearly
identical with [6.7].

Corollary. 6.7.2. If either of the angles at points C and F are right, the other angle
must be right.

Proposition 6.8. SIMILARITY OF RIGHT TRIANGLES.

The triangles formed by dividing a right triangle by the perpendicular from the
right angle to the hypotenuse are similar to the original triangle and to each other.

Proof. Construct right-triangle ACB where BCA is its right angle. Construct
CD such that D is on side AB and AB  DC. We claim that ABC  ACD,

ABC  BCD, and ACD  BCD.

                                             Figure 6.2.9: [6.8]

Consider ABC and ACD: they share BAC, and they each contain a right
angle. By [1.32], ABC and ABD are equiangular. By [Cor. 6.4.1], ABC 
ABD.
Likewise, ABC  BCD. By [6.7, #3], ACD  BCD, which completes the
proof.

Corollary. 6.8.1. The perpendicular DC is a mean proportional between the seg-
ments AD and DB of the hypotenuse. (Since ADC and CDB are equiangular,
AD : DC = DC : DB. Thus DC is a mean proportional between AD and DB [Def.
6.3].)

Corollary. 6.8.2. BC is a mean proportional between AB and BD; also, AC is a
mean proportional between AB and AD.

Corollary. 6.8.3. The segments AD and DB are in the duplicate of AC : CB; in
other words, AD : DB = (AC)2 : (CB)2.

Corollary. 6.8.4. BA : AD are in the duplicate ratios of BA : AC, and AB : BD are
in the duplicate ratio of AB : BC. Or, AB : AD = (AB)2 : (AC)2 and AB : BD =
(AB)2 : (BC)2.

Proposition 6.9. CUTTING OFF SUB-SEGMENTS.

From a given segment, we may cut off any required sub-segment.

Proof. Construct AB; we wish to cut off any required sub-segment from AB.

                                  Figure 6.2.10: [6.9]

                               1                    -                                           -
Suppose we wish to cut 4 th of AB. Construct AF at any acute angle to AB. On AF ,

choose point C and cut off segments CD, DE, and EF where AC = CD = DE = EF

that  AG  =  1  ·  AB.
             4

Since CG  BF where BF is the side of ABF , by [6.2]:

                                  CF : AC = GB : AG

                            (     )                 (         )
                               AC  CF : AC = AG  GB : AG

                                  AF : AC = AB : AG

                                  AC : AF = AG : AB

But   AC  =  1  · AF    by  construction,  and  so  AG  =  1  · AB.  Since  our  choice  of  1  was
             4                                             4                                 4

arbitrary, any other required sub-segment may similarly be cut off.

Proposition 6.10. SIMILARLY DIVIDED SEGMENTS.

We wish to divide a segment similarly to a given divided segment.

Proof. Construct AC divided at points D and E as well as AB where BAC is an
acute angle. We claim that AB can be divided similarly to AC.

                                           Figure 6.2.11: [6.10]

Construct CB, DF , and EG such that DF  CB and EG  CB. Also construct DK
where DK intersects EG at H and where DK  AB.
It follows that DHGF and HKBG are parallelograms; by [1.34] DH = F G and
HK = GB.
Consider DCK: since EH  CK, by [6.2] DE : EC = DH : HK.
But DH = F G and HK = GB; by [5.7], we find that DE : EC = F G : GB.
Consider AEG: since DF  EG, we find that AD : DE = AF : F G.
From the last two proportions we obtain AD : EC = AF : GB. This divides AB
similarly to AC.

Corollary. 6.10.1. We may divide a given undivided segment AB similarly to a
given divided segment DE by constructing AC at an acute angle to AB where AC is
divided into segments similar to DE.

Proposition 6.11. PROPORTIONAL SEGMENTS I.
Given two segments, we wish to find a third proportional segment.

Proof. Construct JK and LM . We wish to construct a segment X such that JK :
LM = LM : X.

Construct AC and AE at an arbitrary acute angle. Cut off AB = JK, BC = LM ,
and AD = LM . Construct BD such that CE  BD. We claim that DE is the
required third proportional segment.
In CAE, BD  CE; by [6.2]. AB : BC = AD : DE. But AB = JK and BC =
LM = AD. Hence JK : LM = LM : DE, which completes the construction.

Remark. Another solution can be inferred from [6.8]. If AD and DC in that propo-
sition are respectively equal to JK and LM , then DB is the third proportional.

Corollary. 6.11.1 Algebraically, this problem can be written as

Proposition 6.12. PROPORTIONAL SEGMENTS II.

We wish to find a fourth proportional to three given segments.

Proof. Construct AK, BM , and CP . We wish to construct a fourth segment pro-

portional to these three segments; specifically, we wish to construct X such that

AK : BM = CP : X.

Construct DE and DF at an arbitrary acute angle. Also construct DG = AK,

GE = BM , and DH = CP . Construct GH such that EF  GH [1.31]. We claim

that HF is the required fourth proportional segment.

                                           Figure 6.2.15: [6.12]

In DEF , GH  EF , and so DG : GE = DH : HF [6.2]. But the above equalities
give us AK : BM = CP : HF . Hence, HF is the fourth proportional to AK, BM ,
and CP , completing the construction.

Corollary. 6.12.1 Algebraically, this problem can be written as

                   ac           bc
                   b = x x= a

where a, b, and c are positive real numbers. From this equation, it is possible to infer
[Cor. 6.11.1] where c = b.

Proposition 6.13. PROPORTIONAL SEGMENTS III.

We wish to find a mean proportional between two given segments.

Proof. Construct EF and GH. We wish to construct a mean proportional between
these segments; specifically, we wish to construct X such that EF : X = X : GH.

                                           Figure 6.2.16: [6.13]

Construct segment AC such that AC = EF  GH where AB = EF and BC = GH.
On AC, construct semicircle ADC. Also construct BD  AC which intersects the
semicircle at D. We claim that BD is the required mean proportional.
Construct AD and DC. Since ADC is a semicircle, ADC is right [3.31]. Since
ADC is a right triangle and BD is a perpendicular from the right angle on the
hypotenuse, BD is a mean proportional between AB and BC [6.8, Cor. 1]. Thus
EF : BD = BD : GH.
This completes the construction.

Corollary. 6.13.1. Algebraically, we have

     ax                                    
     x = b  x = ab

where a and b are positive real numbers.

Proposition 6.14. EQUIANGULAR PARALLELOGRAMS.

Equiangular parallelograms are equal in area if and only if the sides about the
equal angles are reciprocally proportional.

Proof. Construct equiangular parallelograms HACB and CGDE. We wish to
prove that HACB = CGDE if and only if AC : CE = GC : CB.

     Figure 6.2.17: [6.14]

Suppose that HACB = CGDE; we claim that AC : CE = GC : CB.

Place HACB and CGDE so that AE = AC  CE and the equal angles ACB
and ECG stand vertically opposite each other. Notice that

                   ACB + BCE = ECG + BCE = two right angles

since ACB + BCE equals two right angles [1.13]. By [1.14], BC  CG = BG.
Construct BCEF . Since HACB = CGDE,

     AC : CE = HACB : BCEF                                   [6.1]

     HACB : BCEF = CGDE : BCEF (hypothesis)

     CGDE : BCEF = GC : CB                                   [6.1]

Therefore, AC : CE = GC : CB, which proves our first claim.

Now suppose that AC : CE = GC : CB. We claim that HACB = CGDE.
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI  275

                                           Figure 6.2.18: [6.14]

By [6.1],

                                  AC : CE = HACB : BCEF
                                  GC : CB = CGDE : BCEF
Since AC : CE = GC : CB by hypothesis,
                            HACB : BCEF = CGDE : BCEF
By [5.9], HACB = CGDE, which proves our second and final claim.

An alternative proof:

Proof. Suppose that HACB = CGDE; we claim that AC : CE = GC : CB.
Construct HE, BE, HD, and BD. The area of the parallelogram HACB =
2 · HBE, and the area of the parallelogram CGDE = 2 · BDE. Therefore
HBE = BDE, and by [1.39.], HD  BE. Hence HB : BF = DE : EF ; that is,
AC : CE = GC : CB.
Part two may be proved by reversing the above, which completes the proof.
276  CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Proposition 6.15. TRIANGLES WITH EQUAL AREAS.

Construct two triangles which share an equal angle. These triangles have equal
area if and only if their sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.

Proof. Construct ACB and DCE where BCA = DCE. We claim that ACB =
DCE if and only if AC : CD = EC : CB.

     Figure 6.2.19: [6.15]

Suppose that ACB = DCE; we claim that AC : CD = EC : CB.

Place BCA and DCE to stand vertically opposite so that AD = AC  CD; as in
the proof to [6.14], we find that BE = BC  CE. Construct BD.

Since ACB = DCE,

     ACB : BCD = DCE : BCD

     ACB : BCD = AC : CD                       [6.1]

     DCE : BCD = EC : CB                       [6.1]

Therefore, AC : CD = EC : CB, which proves our first claim.

Now suppose that AC : CD = EC : CB; we claim that ACB = DCE.
Using the same construction, we have

     AC : CD = EC : CB      (hypothesis)

     AC : CD = ACB : BCD [6.1]

     EC : CB = DCE : BCD [6.1]

Therefore ACB : BCD = DCE : BCD, and so ACB = DCE [5.9]. This
proves our second and final claim.

Remark. [6.15] might have been appended as a corollary to [6.14] since the trian-
gles are the halves of equiangular parallelograms; it may also be proven by con-
structing AE and showing that it is parallel to BD.

Proposition 6.16. PROPORTIONAL RECTANGLES.

Four segments are proportional if and only if the rectangle contained by the ex-
tremes (i.e., the largest and the smallest segments) equals the rectangle contained
by the means (i.e., the remaining segments).

Proof. We claim that AB : CD = LM : N P if and only if AB · N P = CD · LM .
Let AB = x, CD = y, LM = u, and N P = v. Then

                            xu
                            y = v  xv = yu

which completes the proof.

A geometric proof:

Proof. Place the four segments in a concurrent position so that the extremes form
one continuous segment and the means form a second continuous segment.

                              Figure 6.2.20: [6.16], Alternative proof

Place the four segments in the order AO, BO, OD, and OC. Construct AB and
CD. Because AO : OB = OD : OC and AOB = DOC, the triangles AOB
and COD are equiangular. Thus, the four points A, B, C, and D are concyclic; by
[3.35], AO · OC = BO · OD.
278                     CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Proposition 6.17. LINES AND RECTANGLES.

Three segments are proportional if and only if the rectangle contained by the first
and fourth segments is equal in area to the area of the square of the mean.

Proof. Construct segments AB, CD, and GH so that they are proportional: AB :
CD = CD : GH. We claim that AB · GH = (CD)2.
Let AB = x, CD = y, and GH = z. Then

                                             x = y  xz = y2
                                             yz

This proves our claim.

Remark. This proposition may also be inferred as a corollary to [6.16] by setting
y = u.

3. If a circle passing through the angle at point A of a parallelogram ABCD

                                        Figure 6.2.22: [6.17, #3]

Hint: construct EF , F G, and ABH = AF E. Then the triangles ABH and
AF E are equiangular: it follows that AB : AH = AF : AE, and so AB · AE =
AF · AH.

Again, it is clear that the triangles BCH and GAF are equiangular, and there-
fore BC : CH = AF : AG, and so BC · AG = AF · CH, or AD · AG = AF · CH. But
since AB · AE = AF · AH, we find that AD · AG + AB · AE = AF · CH.

4. If DE, DF are parallels to the sides of ABC from any point D at the base,
prove that AB · AE + AC · AF = (AD)2 + BD · DC.

                   Figure 6.2.23: [6.17, #5]

Hint: notice that

                   AO · AL = AB · AK + AC · AE

and                 (AO)2 = AG · AK + AH · AE - GO · OH
Hence,             AO · OL = BG · AK + CH · AE + GO · OH

8. If from any point P in the circumference of a circle a perpendicular is drawn to
any chord, its square is equal in area to the rectangle contained by the perpendic-

9. If O is the point of intersection of the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD,
prove that the four rectangles AB · BC, BD · CD, CD · DA, DA · AB are proportional
to the four segments BO, CO, DO, AO.

10. PTOLEMY'S THEOREM. The sum of the areas of the rectangles of the opposite
sides of a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD equals the area to the rectangle contained by
its diagonals.

Hint: construct DAO = CAB. Then DAO and CAB are equiangular; there-
fore AD : DO = AC : CB and so AD · BC = AC · DO. Again, the triangles DAC
and OAB are equiangular, and CD : AC = BO : AB, or AC · CD = AC · BO.

cyclic quadrilateral from any point on the circumference of the circumscribed circle
that the rectangle contained by the perpendiculars on the diagonals equals the area

13. If AB is the diameter of a semicircle, and P A, P B are chords from any point
P in the circumference, and if a perpendicular to AB from any point C intersects
P A, P B at D and E and the semicircle at F , prove that CF is a mean proportional
between CD and CE.
282  CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Proposition 6.18. CONSTRUCTION OF A SIMILAR POLYGON.

We may construct a polygon that is similar and similarly placed to a given polygon
on a given segment.

Proof. Construct polygon CDEF G and segment AB. We wish to construct a poly-
gon on AB similar to polygon CDEF G and similarly placed.

                                           Figure 6.2.24: [6.18]

Construct CE and CF . Also construct ABH on AB such that ABH is equiangu-
lar to CDE and is similarly placed in regards to CD; that is, construct ABH =
CDE and BAH = DCE.
Also construct HAI equiangular to ECF and similarly placed. Finally, con-
struct IAJ equiangular and similarly placed with F CG. We claim that ABHIJ
is the required polygon.

By construction, it is evident that the figures are equiangular, and it is only re-
quired to prove that the sides about the equal angles are proportional.

Because ABH is equiangular to CDE, we find that AB : BH = CD : DE [6.4].
Hence the sides about the equal angles at points B and D are proportional.

Again from the same triangles, we have BH : HA = DE : EC, and from the
triangles IHA, F EC, we have HA : HI = EC : EF . Therefore, BH : HI =
DE : EF , or the sides about the equal angles BHI, DEF are proportional.
This result follows about the other equal angles, mutatis mutandis. By [Def. 6.1]
and our placement of each triangle, the proof is complete.
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI  283

Remark. In the above construction, the segment AB corresponds to CD, and it is
evident that we may take AB to correspond to any other side of the given figure
CDEF G.

Again, in each case, if the figure ABHIJ is turned round the segment AB until
it falls on the other side, it will still be similar to the figure CDEF G. Hence on
a given segment AB, there can be constructed two figures each similar to a given
figure CDEF G and having the given segment AB correspond to any given side CD
of the given figure.

The first of the figures thus constructed is said to be directly similar, and the second
is said to be inversely similar to the given figure.

Corollary. 6.18.1. Twice as many polygons may be constructed on AB similar to a
given polygon CDEF G as that figure has sides.

Corollary. 6.18.2. If the figure ABHIJ is applied to CDEF G so that the point A
coincides with C and that the segment AB is placed along CD, then the points H,
I, J will be respectively on the segments CE, CF , CG. Also, the sides BH, HI, IJ
of the one polygon will be respectively parallel to their corresponding sides DE, EF ,
F G of the other.

Corollary. 6.18.3. If segments constructed from any point O in the plane of a figure
to all its vertices are divided in the same ratio, the segments joining the points of
division will form a new figure similar to and having every side parallel to the
corresponding side of the original.

The areas of similar triangles have a ratio equal to the square of the ratio of the

                                           Figure 6.2.25: [6.19]

Using [6.11], construct AG such that BC : EF = EF : BG.
Since AB : BC = DE : EF by hypothesis, AB : DE = BC : EF by [5.16]. Taken
together and applying [5.11], AB : DE = EF : BG.
Consider ABG and DEF : the sides about equal angles are reciprocally propor-
tional. By [6.15], ABG = DEF .

                                                                     ( )2 ( )2
Since BC : EF = EF : BG, by [Def. 5.9], we have BC : EF = BC : BG.
By [6.1], we also have BC : BG = ABC : ABG, and applying the above, we

                                   ( )2 ( )2
obtain ABC : ABG = BC : EF .

                                                                          ( )2 ( )2
Since ABG = DEF , we have ABC : DEF = BC : EF , which proves
our claim.

Remark. [6.19] is the first of Euclid's Proposition in which [Def. 5.9], the duplicate
ratio, is employed.
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI                              285

An alternate proof:

Proof. Suppose that ABC  DEF . On AB and DE, construct squares AGHB
and DLM E, respectively. Through points C and F construct segments parallel
and respectively equal to AB and DE. Extend AG, BH, DL, and EM to points J,

I, O, and N , respectively; this constructs rectangles JABI and ODEN .

                     Figure 6.2.26: [6.19] (Casey's proof)

Clearly, JAC and ODF are equiangular. By [6.4], JA : AC = OD : DF and
AC : AB = DF : DE; thus, JA : AB = OD : DE. Since AB = AG and DE = DL
by construction, JA : AG = OD : DL. By [6.1], JA : AG = JABI : AGHB and
OD : DL = ODEN : DLM E. Hence

                             JABI : AGHB = ODEN : DLM E

By [5.16],

                    JABI : ODEN = AGHB : DLM E
            12 · JABI : 12 · ODEN = (AB)2 : (DE)2

                       ABC : DEF = (AB)2 : (DE)2

Proposition 6.20. DIVISION OF SIMILAR POLYGONS.

Similar polygons may be divided such that:
   (1) they divide into the same number of similar triangles,
   (2) corresponding triangles have the same ratio to one another as the polygons

have to each other,
   (3) the polygons have a duplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.

Proof. Construct polygons ABHIJ and CDEF G such that ABHIJ  CDEF G and
sides AB and CD correspond to each other. Also construct AH, AI, CE, and CF .
We shall prove each claim separately.

                                           Figure 6.2.27: [6.20]

Claim 1: ABHIJ and CDEF G divide into the same number of similar triangles.

Since ABHIJ  CDEF G, ABHIJ and CDEF G are equiangular and have pro-
portional sides about their equal angles. It follows that ABH = CDE and
AB : BH = CD : DE. By [6.6], ABH is equiangular to CDE, and so BHA =
DEC. Since BHI = DEF by hypothesis, it follows that AHI = CEF .
Again, since ABHIJ  CDEF G, IH : HB = F E : ED. Since ABH and CDE
are equiangular, ABH  CDE and so HB : HA = ED : EC. It follows that
IH : HA = FE : EC.

Since AHI = CEF and IH : HA = F E : EC, AHI  CEF . Similarly,
we may show that all remaining triangles are also equiangular, which proves our
claim.

Claim 2: corresponding triangles within ABHIJ and CDEF G have the same ratio
to one another as the polygons have to each other.

Since ABH  CDE, by [6.19], ABH : CDE is in the duplicate ratio of
AH : CE.

Also by [6.19], AHI : CEF is in the duplicate ratio of AH : CE.

Hence, ABH : CDE = AHI : CEF and AHI : CEF = AIJ : CF G,
mutatis mutandis. Clearly, ABH : CDE = AIJ : CF G. By [5.12],

     ABH = ABH + AHI + AIJ
     C DE  CDE + CEF + CF G

     ABH = ABHIJ
     C DE  CDEF G

which proves claim 2.

Claim 3: the polygons have a duplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.
By [6.19], ABH : CDE is in the duplicate ratio of AB : CD. Since

                                            ABH = ABHIJ
                                            CDE CDEF G

ABHIJ : CDEF G is also in the duplicate ratio of AB : CD, which proves our third
and final claim.

Corollary. 6.20.1. The perimeters of similar polygons are to one another in the
ratio of their corresponding sides.

Corollary. 6.20.2. As squares are to similar polygons, the duplicate ratio of two

they are to one another as the similar elementary triangles into which they are

Proposition 6.21. TRANSITIVITY OF SIMILAR POLYGONS.

Polygons which are similar to the same figure are similar to one another.

Proof. Construct polygons ABC, DEF , and GHI such that ABC  GHI and DEF 
GHI. We claim that ABC  DEF .

           Figure 6.2.30: [6.21] Note that the polygons need not be triangles.

Since ABC  GHI, they are equiangular and have the sides about their equal
angles proportional. Similarly, DEF and GHI are equiangular and have the sides
about their equal angles proportional.
Hence ABC and DEF are equiangular and have the sides about their equal angles
proportional; or, ABC  DEF . This completes the proof.

Remark. Our proof did not use any properties of triangles that are absent in an
arbitrary n-sided polygon.

Proposition 6.22. PROPORTIONALITY OF FOUR SEGMENTS TO THE POLY-
GONS CONSTRUCTED UPON THEM.

Four segments are proportional if and only if the rectilinear figures similar and
similarly described upon them are also proportional.

Proof. Suppose that AB : CD = EF : GH. Construct similar polygons ABK and
CDL on AB and CD as well as M EF I and N GHJ on EF and GH.

                     Figure 6.2.31: [6.22]

Suppose AB : CD = EF : GH. We wish to show that ABK : CDL = HEF I :

N GHJ. Notice that:

( )2 ( )2                       ( )2 ( )2
                     AB : CD = EF : GH

ABK : CDL = (AB)2 : (CD)2 [6.20]

HEF I : N GHJ = (EF )2 : (GH)2 [6.20]

It follows that ABK : CDL = HEF I : N GHJ, which proves our first claim.

Now suppose ABK : CDL = HEF I : N GHJ; similarly to the above, we
obtain (AB)2 : (CD)2 = (EF )2 : (GH)2. By [5.22, Cor. 1], AB : CD = EF : GH,
which proves our second and final claim.

Proposition 6.23. EQUIANGULAR PARALLELOGRAMS.

The areas of equiangular parallelograms have a ratio to each other equal to the
ratio of the rectangles contained by their sides about a pair of equal angles.

Proof. Construct equiangular parallelograms HABD and BGEC where ABD =
                            (                      )(  )
GBC. We claim that HABD : BGEC = AB · BD : BC · BG .

                            Figure 6.2.32: [6.23]

Let the sides AB and BC about the equal angles ABD and CBG be placed such
that AC = AB  BC. As in [6.14], GB  BD = GD.

Complete the parallelogram DBCF . By [6.1],

                                 HABD : DBCF = AB : BC
                                  DBCF : BGEC = BD : BG

It follows that

                                                   (   )(    )
     (HABD · DBCF ) : (DBCF · BGEC) = AB · BD : BC · BG
                                                   (   )(    )
                            HABD : BGEC = AB · BD : BC · BG

which completes the proof.

Proposition 6.24. SIMILAR PARALLELOGRAMS ABOUT THE DIAGONAL.

In any parallelogram, the parallelograms about the diagonal are similar both to
the whole and to one another.

Proof. Construct ABCD, GH  AB where GH = AB, and EK  AD where EK =
AD. Also construct diagonal AC. We claim that ABCD  AEF G, ABCD 
F HCK, and AEF G  F HCK.

                                
Consider ABC: since EF  BC, by [6.2] BE : EA = CF : F A.

                                 
Consider ACD: since F G  CD, also by [6.2] CF : F A = DG : GA. It follows that

BE : EA = DG : GA.

                                           Figure 6.2.33: [6.24]

By [5.18], BA : EA = AD : AG, and so BA : AD = EA : AG. Notice that in ABCD
and AEF G the sides about DAB are proportional.

        
Since GF  DC, AF G = ACD. Since ADC and AGF share DAC and
ACD, it follows that ADC and AGF are equiangular. Likewise, ACB and
AF E are equiangular, and so ABCD and AEF G are also equiangular.
It follows that AD : DC = AG : GF , DC : AC = GF : AF , AC : CB = AF : F E, and
CB : BA = F E : EA. Notice that DC : CB = GF : F E, or the sides about ABCD
and AEF G are proportional. By [Def. 6.1], ABCD  AEF G.
Likewise, ABCD  F HCK. By [6.21], AEF G  F HCK, which completes
the proof.

Corollary. 6.24.1. Taken in pairs, the parallelograms AEF G, F HCK, and
ABCD are homothetic.

Proposition 6.25. CONSTRUCTION OF A POLYGON EQUAL IN AREA TO A
GIVEN FIGURE AND SIMILAR TO A SECOND GIVEN FIGURE.

Proof. We wish to construct a polygon equal in area to ALM N but similar to poly-
gon BCD.

     Figure 6.2.34: [6.25] Note that polygon BCD need not be a triangle.

Wlog, on side BC of the polygon BCD, construct the rectangle BJEC = BCD
[1.44], and on CE construct the rectangle CEKF = ALM N [1.45].

Construct GH such that BC : GH = GH : CF [6.13]. On GH, construct polygon
GHI  BCD [6.18] where BC and GH are corresponding sides. We claim that GHI
is the required polygon.

Since BC : GH = GH : CF ,  BC ( BC )2
                                 =

                           CF GH

Since BCD  GHI, by [6.20]

                           BCD ( BC )2
                                 =
                           GH I     GH

We also have that BC : CF = BJEC : CEKF , and so BJCE : CEKF =
BCD : GHI.

But the rectangle BJEC is equal in area to the polygon BCD; therefore, CEKF =
GHI. Since CEKF = ALM N by construction, it follows that GHI = ALM N
where GHI  BCD by construction.
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI  297

An alternate proof:

Proof. Construct squares EF JK and LM N O such that EF JK = polygon DCB
and LM N O = polygon AP QS [2.14]. By [6.12], construct GH such that EF :
LM = BC : GH.

    Figure 6.2.35: [6.25], alternate proof. Note that BCD need not be a triangle.

On GH, construct the polygon GHI similar to the polygon BCD [6.18] such that
BC and GH are corresponding sides. We claim that GHI is the required polygon.
Because EF : LM = BC : GH by construction, we find that EF JK : LM N O =
BCD : GHI [6.22]. But EF JK = BCD by construction; therefore, LM N O = GHI.
But LM N O = AP QS by construction. Therefore GHI = AP QS and is similar to
BCD.
298  CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Proposition 6.26. PARALLELOGRAMS ON A COMMON ANGLE.

If two similar and similarly situated parallelograms have a common angle, then
they stand on the same diagonal.

Proof. Construct AEF G and ABCD such that each are similar and similarly
situated where GAF is a common angle. We claim that they stand on the same
diagonal, AC.

                                           Figure 6.2.36: [6.26]

Construct the diagonals AF and AC. Because AEF G  ABCD by hypothe-
sis, they can be divided into the same number of similar triangles [6.20]. Hence,
GAF  CAD, and it follows that GAF = CAD.
Hence, AC contains point F , and so the parallelograms stand on AC.

Remark. [6.26] is the converse of [6.24] and may have been misplaced in an early
edition of Euclid. The following would be a simpler statement of result: "If two
homothetic parallelograms have a common angle, they stand on the same diagonal."

Proposition 6.27. INSCRIBING A PARALLELOGRAM IN A TRIANGLE I.

In a given triangle, we wish to inscribe the parallelogram with maximum area
having a common angle with a given triangle.

Proof. Construct ABC where the given angle is ABC. Bisect AC at P ; through
                
P, construct P E  BC and P F  AB. We claim that EBF P is the required

parallelogram.

                Figure 6.2.37: [6.27]

Construct AL = BC where AL  BC as well as CL. By [1.33], CL  BA and

CL = BA.

                                                               
Take any point D on AC other than P and construct DG  BC which intersects P F
                                         
at O, AB at G, and CL at J. Also construct DH  AB which intersects EK at I and

BC at H.

Since AC is bisected at P , EK is also bisected in P . By [1.36], EGOP = P OJK.
Therefore, EGOP > IDJK; but IDJK = OF HD [1.43], and so EGOP >
OF HD.

Add GBF O to each, and we find that EBF P > GBHD. Since our choice of D
was any point on AC other than P , and since EBF P contains ABC, EBF P
is the maximum parallelogram which can be inscribed in the triangle ABC and
which contains ABC.

Corollary. 6.27.1. The maximum parallelogram exceeds the area of any other par-
allelogram about the same angle in the triangle by the area of the similar parallelo-
gram whose diagonal is the line between the midpoint P of the opposite side and the
point D, which is the corner of the other inscribed parallelogram.

Corollary. 6.27.2. The parallelograms inscribed in a triangle and having one angle
common with it are proportional to the rectangles contained by the segments of the
sides of the triangle made by the opposite corners of the parallelograms.

Proposition 6.28. INSCRIBING A PARALLELOGRAM IN A TRIANGLE II.

We wish to inscribe in a given triangle a parallelogram equal in area to a given poly-
gon (the area of which is less than or equal to the area of the maximum inscribed
polygon constructed in [6.27]) and having an angle in common with the triangle.

Proof. Construct ABC. Bisect AC at P , construct P F  BC, and construct P E 
AB. Applying [6.27], construct EBF P , the maximum inscribed parallelogram
within ABC. We wish to inscribe in ABC a parallelogram equal in area to
polygon X (given that area X  EBF P ) and which shares ABC.

                                           Figure 6.2.38: [6.28]

If area X = EBF P , the construction is complete.
Otherwise, extend EP to EJ, construct CJ  P F where CJ = P F [1.33].
By [6.25], construct KLM N such that KLM N = P F CJ - X and KLM N 
P F CJ. On P J, construct P I = KL. Construct IH = P F such that IH  AB and
IH intersects AC at D. Also construct DG  BC. We claim that GBHD is the
required parallelogram.

Clearly, GBHD shares ABC in common with ABC.
Since P F CJ and P ODI stand on the same diagonal, by [6.24] P F CJ  P ODI.
Since P F CJ  KM N L by construction, by [6.21] P ODI  KM N L. Since
KL = P I, P ODI = KM N L.
By [Cor. 6.27.1], P ODI = EBF P -GBHD; by the above, KM N L = P F CJ-
X. Hence,

                                EBF P - GBHD = P F CJ - X
302  CHAPTER 6. APPLICATIONS OF PROPORTIONS

Since BF = F C by construction, EBF P = P F CJ. Thus,
                                                GBHD = X

which completes the construction.

Remark. This proposition geometrically solves the equation ay - y2 = C where C =

Proposition 6.29. ESCRIBING A PARALLELOGRAM TO A TRIANGLE.

Given a polygon, a segment, and a parallelogram, we wish to construct a new par-
allelogram on the given segment whose area is equal to the given polygon. An
extension of this new parallelogram will be similar to the given parallelogram.

Proof. We wish to construct a parallelogram (AP OI) equal in area to polygon
CU V W X on segment AB. An extension of AP OI (BP OQ) will be similar to
DRST .

                                           Figure 6.2.39: [6.29]

Bisect AB at E. Construct F EBL on EB such that F EBL  DRST and
where F EBL is similarly situated to DRST . By [6.25] construct GKHJ =
F EBL + CU V W X where GKHJ  DRST . Let KH correspond to F L and KG
correspond to F E.

Since GKHJ > F EBL, it follows that KH > F L and KG > F E.
Extend F L to F M where F M = KH, and extend F E to F N where F N = KG.

Construct F M ON ; by [6.26] F M ON = GKHJ and F M ON  GKHJ.
But GKHJ  F EBL, and so F M ON  F EBL [6.21]. By [6.26], F M ON
and F EBL stand on the same diameter.
Construct diameter F O of F M ON . Since GKHJ = F EBL + CU V W X and
GKHJ = F M ON , F M ON = F EBL + CU V W X. Subtracting the area of
F EBL from each side of the equation, we obtain gnomon EBLM ON = CU V W X.

AEN I = LM BP . Hence

                         AEN I + EP ON = LM BP + EP ON

Proposition 6.31. AREA OF SQUARES ON A RIGHT TRIANGLE.

If any similar quadrilateral is similarly constructed on the three sides of a right
triangle, the quadrilateral on the hypotenuse is equal in area to the sum of the
areas of the quadrilaterals constructed on the two other sides.

Proof. Construct ABC. Denote the sides of ABC by a, b, and c where c is the
hypotenuse, and denote the corresponding areas of the similar polygons by , ,
and . We claim that  +  = .

                 Figure 6.2.41: [6.31]

Because the polygons are similar, by [6.20]

                  = c2 and  = c2

It follows that   +  a2 + b2

But a2 + b2 = c2 by [1.47]. Therefore,  +  = , which proves our claim.

Proposition 6.32. FORMATION OF TRIANGLES.

If two triangles exist such that a pair of sides in one is proportional to a pair of

the remaining sides of the triangles form a segment.

Proof. Construct ABC and DCE such that AB : AC = DC : DE, AB  DC,

CDE = ACD; hence, BAC = CDE.
Consider ABC and DCE: BAC = CDE and AB : AC = DC : DE. By [6.6],
ABC and DCE are equiangular, and so ABC = DCE.

                       ACE + ACB = BAC + ABC + ACB
                                                 = two right angles [1.32]

Thus, BE = BC  CE, which proves our claim.

Proposition 6.33. RATIOS OF EQUAL TRIANGLES.

In equal circles, angles at the centers or at the circumferences have the same ratio
to one another as the arcs on which they stand.

Proof. Construct G and H with equal radii. Construct BGC at the center of G
and EHF at the center of H; also construct BAC at the circumference of G
and EDF at the circumference of H. We wish to show that

                    arc BC : arc EF = BGC : EHF = BAC : EDF

     Figure 6.2.43: [6.33] Copyright Prime.mover, licensed under CC SA 3.0

On G, construct a finite number n of consecutive arcs CK, KL which are equal in
length to arc BC. On H, construct n consecutive arcs F M , M N which are equal
in length to arc EF .

Construct GK, GL, HM , and HN . Since BC = CK = KL, by [3.27] BGC =
CGK = KGL. It follows that if arc BL = n · arc BC, then BGL = n · BGC.
Similarly, if arc EN = n · arc EF , then EHN = n · EHF .

Since BL  >  0 and EN  >  0,  BL  =  k  where k  >  0 is a positive real number.  Hence,
                              EN

BL = k · EN.

Since                  EHN = BGL = n = BL = EN
it follows that        EHF BGC                      BC EF

                                  k · EN = k · EN
                                    BC k · EF

and so                                  BC
                                              =k

                                        EF
6.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VI  309

Similarly, BGL = k · EHN , and so BC : EF = BGC : EHF . Applying [3.20],
we obtain

                          BC : EF = BGC : EHF = BAC : DEF

This proves our claim.

Corollary. 6.33.1 In equal circles, sectors have the same ratio to one another as the
arcs on which they stand.

Elementary Number Theory

All variables represent natural numbers (i.e, positive integers) unless otherwise
specified.

7.1 Definitions

0. The Whole Numbers are the set of numbers containing 0, 1, 2, 3, ... . The Natural

Numbers (the positive integers) are a subset of the Whole numbers, containing 1,

2, 3, ... . We define the Rational Numbers as the set of numbers that can be

written  p  where both p and q are whole numbers where q      = 0.  (Notice that the
         q

rational numbers include the whole numbers.) We also define the Real Numbers

as the rational numbers and the irrational numbers. We do not require the use of

negative numbers.

1. We define the number 1 as the unit number, or more simply as the unit.

2. A number is a multiple of units; that is, if x is a natural number, then x = xu =
u + u + ... + u where u = 1 and u is added to itself a total of x times.

3. A number x is a factor of y when x < y and there exists some whole number
n  1 where nx = y. We may also write that x is a divisor of y or that y is a multiple
of x.

Notice that the condition nx = y may be rewritten y - nx = 0.

The proper factors of y are all factors of y except 1 and y.

4. An even number x is any whole number such that x = 2b where b  1 is whole
number.

5. An odd number is any whole number which is not even. We may write such
numbers as x = 2b + 1 where b  0 is whole number.
6. An even-times even number x is any whole number which is the product of two
even numbers.

                                                       319
320   CHAPTER 7. ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY

7. An even-times odd number is any whole number which is the product of an even
number and an odd number.

8. An odd-times odd number is any whole number which is the product of two odd
numbers.

9. A prime number p is any whole number such that p > 1 and where p has only
two factors: 1 and itself.

The prime factors of y are all prime numbers which are factors of y.

10. Natural numbers x and y are said to be relatively prime (or co-prime) if the only
whole number that evenly divides both x and y is 1.

11. A composite number c is any whole number where c > 1 and where c is not
prime. All natural numbers other than 1 are prime or composite.

12. Natural numbers x and y are said to be relatively composite if x and y are not
relatively prime.

13. A whole number x is said to multiply a whole number y when xy = y + y + ... + y
where y is added to itself a total of x times.

14. When two numbers are multiplied to produce a third number, the third number
is called a product. Since both numbers are positive, the product is positive, and
it may be admissible to interpret the product as an area. (Euclid refers to these
numbers as plane numbers.)

15. When three numbers are multiplied to produce a fourth number and the initial
three numbers are positive, the product is positive, and it may be admissible to in-
terpret the product as a volume. (Euclid refers to these numbers as solid numbers.)

16. A square number x is any number such that x = b2 = b · b for some real number
b.

17. A cube (or a cubed number) x is any number such that x = b3 = b · b · b for some
real number b.

19. A perfect number x is a whole number which is equal to the sum of its factors
except for x itself.1

Examples: 6 is a perfect number because 6 = 1 · 6 = 2 · 3 and 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. Also, 28
is also a perfect number: since 28 = 1 · 28 = 2 · 14 = 4 · 7 and 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.

20. A proper fraction has a numerator which is less than its denominator.

Proposition 7.1. THE EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE IF TWO
NUMBERS ARE RELATIVELY PRIME.

Let x1  x2 be natural numbers. There exists some positive integer n such that

                                               x1 - n · x2  0

and
                                            x1 - (n + 1) · x2 < 0

We begin the algorithm with x1 - n1 · x2 = x3 where n1 is chosen as above. We
continue as long as the right-hand side of each equation is greater than 1:

                                            x1 - n1 · x2 = x3
                                            x2 - n2 · x3 = x4

                                                              ...
                                        xk - nk · xk+1 = xk+2

stopping when xk+2 = 0 or xk+2 = 1. If xk+2 = 1, then x1 and x2 are relatively
prime.

Proof. Suppose we use the Euclidean Algorithm and obtain:

                                             x1 - n1 · x2 = x3
                                             x2 - n2 · x3 = x4

                                                                ...
                                          xk - nk · xk+1 = 1

but x1 and x2 are not relatively prime. It follows that x1 and x2 possess a common
factor other than 1. Suppose t > 1 is the common factor where x1 = ty1 and x2 = ty2.
It follows that

                                            ty1 - n1 · ty2 = x3
                                          t (y1 - n1 · y2) = x3

or t is a factor of x3; that is, x3 = ty3. Similarly, we can show that all xk possess a
factor of t.

But by hypothesis, xk - nk · xk+1 = xk+2 = 1. By the above, xk+2 = tyk+2, and so
1 = tyk+2. Hence, t = 1 = yk+2. But t > 1 by the above, a contradiction. Thus, x1
and x2 are relatively prime.
7.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VII                                 323

Corollary. [7.1.1] If xk+2 = 0 in the final step of the Euclidean Algorithm, then x1
and x2 share a common factor.

Proof. Suppose we use the Euclidean Algorithm to obtain:

                             x1 - n1 · x2 = x3
                             x2 - n2 · x3 = x4

                                               ...
                          xk - nk · xk+1 = 0

Notice that xk = nk · xk+1, and so xk+1 is a factor of xk. Similarly, we can show that
xk+1 is also a factor of xk-1, ..., x2, x1. This completes the proof.

Remark. See also [10.2].

Example. [7.1.1]: Are 363 and 19600 relatively prime?
Let x1 = 19600 and x2 = 363. Then x1 > x2 and:

                                       19600 - (53)(363) = 361

where n1 = 53. To justify our choice of 53 for n1, notice that

                                       19600 - (52)(363) = 724
                                       19600 - (54)(363) = -2

We continue:

                          19600 - (53)(363) = 361
                              363 - (1)(361) = 2
                              361 - (180)(2) = 1

where n2 = 1 and n3 = 180. Since we have continued the algorithm until the RHS
equals 1, by [7.1], 363 and 19600 are relatively prime.2

Example. [7.1.2]: Are 350 and 19600 relatively prime?
Let x1 = 19600 and x2 = 350. Then x1 > x2 and 19600 - (56)(350) = 0. Clearly, no
choice of n1 will produce a RHS equaling 1. By [Cor. 7.1.1], 350 and 19600 are not
relatively prime.

    2Recall that RHS stands for the right-hand side of an equation and LHS stands for the left-hand side
of an equation.

Remark. [10.2] shows that the Euclidean Algorithm may not terminate under real
numbers.

Proposition 7.2. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR (GREATEST COMMON
DIVISOR).

Given two natural numbers, there exists a largest common factor. We may call this
positive integer the greatest common divisor (GCD) or the greatest common factor
(GCF).

Proof. Let x1 > x2 be whole numbers. We wish to find the greatest common factor
of x1 and x2.
Suppose we use the Euclidean Algorithm and obtain:

                                             x1 - n1 · x2 = x3
                                             x2 - n2 · x3 = x4

                                                                ...
                                       xk-1 - nk-1 · xk = xk+1

If the final equation terminates the algorithm, either xk+1 = 1 or xk+1 = 0 [7.1],
[Cor. 7.1.1]; that is, if xk+1 > 1, we may continue the algorithm until xk+1 equals
either 1 or 0.
If xk+1 = 1, then x1, x2 are relatively prime and their GCD equals 1.
If xk+1 = 0, then xk is a common factor of x1, x2. Suppose xk  t and t divides x1, x2.
Since x2 = r2 · xk and x1 = r1 · r2 · xk, we find that t divides xk, and so t  xk. Hence,
t = xk, and so xk is the GCD of x1, x2. This completes the proof.

Example. [7.2.1]: What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of 19600 and 42?
Let x1 = 19600 and x2 = 42 (fulfilling the assumption that x1 > x2). Then

                                        19600 - (466)(42) = 28
                                               42 - (1)(28) = 14
                                               28 - (2)(14) = 0

By [Cor. 7.1.1], 19600 and 42 have a common factor. Since the final equation of the
algorithm equals 0, by [7.2], 14 is the GCF of 19600 and 42.

Example. [7.2.2]: What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of 18792 and 36?
Let x1 = 18792 and x2 = 36 (fulfilling the assumption that x1 > x2). Then

18792 - (522)(36) = 0

By [Cor. 7.1.1], 18792 and 36 have a common factor. Since the final equation of the
algorithm equals 0, by [7.2], 36 is the GCF of 18792 and 36.

Corollary. 7.2.1. If k divides both x1 and x2, then k also divides the GCF of x1, x2.

Proposition 7.3. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR OF THREE RELATIVELY
COMPOSITE NUMBERS.

Proof. We claim a GCF exists for relatively composite numbers x1, x2, and x3.
By [7.2], the GCF for x1 and x2 exists; denote it as y. Similarly, the GCF for y and
x3 exists; denote it as z. We claim that z is the GCF for x1, x2, and x3.
Since z|y, y|x1, and y|x2, it follows that z|x1 and z|x2. Since z|x3 by the above, we
have proven our claim.

Remark. The result of [7.3] is identical to the result of [10.4].

Example. [7.3.1]: What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of 19600, 672, and 42?
First, we find the GCF of 19600 and 672:

                                       19600 - (29)(672) = 112
                                           672 - (5)(112) = 112
                                           112 - (1)(112) = 0
326                                      CHAPTER 7. ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY

The GCF of 19600 and 672 is 112.
Next, we find the GCF of 112 and 42:

                                         112 - (2)(42) = 28
                                          42 - (1)(28) = 14
                                          28 - (2)(14) = 0

By [7.3], the GCF of 19600, 672, and 42 is 14.

Proposition 7.4. FRACTIONS.

If  x1  >  x2     are  natural  numbers,  then       there  exists  a  proper    fraction   a  such  that
                                                                                            b

                                                         a
                                                  x2 = b · x1

Proof. Let x1 > x2 be natural numbers. Notice that

                                                  0 < x2 < 1
                                                       x1

and so xx21 is a proper fraction. Also notice that x2 = xx21 · x1. Write xx21 = ab where ab is

written       in  lowest  terms.  Since  x2  is   a  proper    fraction,  a  is  a  proper  fraction.  Then
                                         x1                               b

                                                         a
                                                  x2 = b · x1

This completes the proof.

TIONS

If ai, bi are real numbers for i = 1, 2, ..., n, and

then

Proof. Our hypothesis and claim are stated above. By n - 1 applications of [7.13],

Proposition 7.15. COMMUTATIVITY OF MULTIPLICATION I.

Let n be a real number. We claim that 1 · n = n · 1.

Proof. Case 1: Let n = 0 be a real number. Suppose that
                                                 1 · n = an · 1

where a is a real number. Dividing each side by n, we obtain 1 = a · 1, and so a = 1.
It follows 1 · n = n · 1.
Case 2: Let n = 0. Clearly, 1 · 0 = 0 = 0 · 1.
This completes the proof.

                            m (m · 1) = n(1 · m)

                                       mn = nm

which completes the proof.

                            b = 1 · b = k · b = kb

Then

                                                   ad = bc

upon applying [7.16]. Starting with ad = bc and working backwards provides the
contrapositive case, completing the proof.

Proposition 7.20. REDUCTION TO LOWEST TERMS.
If a : b reduces to c : e in lowest terms, then c is a factor of a.
Proof. Suppose that a : b reduces to c : e in lowest terms. Then

                                         c = a1 · a2 · ... · ak

where     each  ai,  bi  is  a  natural  number.         If  this  were      not  the  case,  then  either  a  =  c
                                                                                                            b     e

or  a  =  c  =  d  where     a  :  b  reduces  to  d  :  f  in  lowest  terms.    Since

                         (a1 · a2 · ... · ak) · t = a1 · a2 · ... · ak · ak+1 · ... · am

for some natural t, by [Def. 7.3], c is a factor of a.

Proposition 7.21. RELATIVE PRIMES I.
If a is relatively prime to b, then the ratio a : b is reduced to lowest terms.
334                                  CHAPTER 7. ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY

Proof. Suppose a is relatively prime to b; that is, a and b share no common factor.
Then

                                     a = a1 · a2 · ... · am
                                     b  b1 · b2 · ... · bn

where no ai = bk for any 1  i  m or any 1  k  n.

Also suppose that a : b is not reduced to lowest terms. Then some ai = bk, contra-
dicting the above. Hence, a : b is reduced to lowest terms.

Proposition 7.22. RELATIVE PRIMES II.

If the ratio a : b is reduced to lowest terms, then a is relatively prime to b.

Proof. Suppose instead that a = mk and b = nk for natural numbers k, m, n. Then

                                        a km m

                                        b kn n

where  m  <  a  and  n  <  b.  This  contradicts  our  hypothesis  that  a  is  reduced  to  lowest
                                                                         b

terms. Hence, a is relatively prime to b.

Corollary. 7.22.1 [7.21] and [7.22] state that a : b is reduced to lowest terms iff a is
relatively prime to b.

Corollary. 7.22.2 TRANSITIVITY OF FACTORS. If x is a factor of y and y is a
factor of z, then x is a factor of z.

Proof. If y = kx and z = ry, then z = rk · x.

Proposition 7.23. RELATIVE PRIMES III.

If a and b are relatively prime and c > 1 is a factor of a, then b and c are also
relatively prime.

Proof. Suppose a and b are relatively prime such that c > 1 is a factor of a where
ck = a. We claim that b and c are relatively prime.
Suppose instead that b and c are not relatively prime; specifically, that b = tr and
c = ts.
It follows that a = ck = tks and b = tr; hence, a and b are not relatively prime,
contrary to our hypothesis. Thus, b and c are relatively prime.

Proposition 7.24. RELATIVE PRIMES IV.

If x and y are relatively prime to z, then xy is also relatively prime to z.

Proof. Since x is relatively prime to z, any list of prime factors of x will not contain
any prime factors of z. Similarly, any list of prime factors of y will not contain any
prime factors of z.

Since any list of prime factors of xy can only contain prime factors of x and y, such
a list will not contain any prime factors of z, which proves our claim.

Proposition 7.25. RELATIVE PRIMES V.

If x and y are relatively prime, then x2 is relatively prime to y.

Proof. Apply [7.24]: if x and x are relatively prime to y, then x · x = x2 is also
relatively prime to y.

Proposition 7.26. RELATIVE PRIMES VI.

If x is relatively prime to s and t, and if y is also relatively prime to s and t, then xy
is relatively prime to st.

Proof. Since x and y are each relatively prime to s, xy is also relatively prime to s
[7.24]. Similarly, xy is relatively prime to t.
Since s and t are each relatively prime to xy, by a final application of [7.24], st is
relatively prime to xy . This proves our claim.

Proposition 7.27. RELATIVE PRIMES VII.
If x and y are relatively prime, then x2 and y2 are relatively prime.
Proof. Since x and y are relatively prime, by [7.25] x2 and y are relatively prime.
Since y and x2 are relatively prime, again by [7.25], y2 and x2 are relatively prime,
which proves our claim.

Proof. This proof requires induction.3 Suppose x and y are relatively prime. By
[7.25], x and y2 are relatively prime. Suppose that x and yk are relatively prime;
we wish to show x and yk+1 are also relatively prime.

Notice that yk+1 = y · yk. If x and yk+1 share a common factor, then x and y · yk
share a common factor. But x is neither a factor of y nor yk by hypothesis. Hence, x
and yk+1 are relatively prime. The completes the proof.

Corollary. 7.27.2 If x and y are relatively prime, then xn and yn are relatively
prime.

Exercises.
1. If x and y are relatively prime, then x3 and y3 are relatively prime.

Proposition 7.28. RELATIVE PRIMES VIII.

Let x and y be natural numbers.
   (1) If x and y are relatively prime, then x + y is relatively prime to both x and y.
   (2) If x + y is relatively prime to either x or to y, then x and y are relatively prime.

Proof. We prove each claim separately.

Claim 1: if x and y are relatively prime, then x + y is relatively prime to both x and
y.

If  x  +  y  and  x  are  not  relatively  prime,    then   there  exists   some  n   >  1  such  that  x+y
                                                                                                          n

and    x  are   integers.  Since  x+y  >   x
       n                            n      n

                                           x+y x            y
                                               n -n = n

where     y  is also a positive integer.       Since     x  and    y  are natural numbers, x and y
          n                                              n         n

are not relatively prime. A similar argument follows if we assume x + y and y are

not relatively prime. Since this is the contrapositive statement of claim 1, we have

completed this part of the proof.

Claim 2: if x + y is relatively prime to x or to y, then x and y are relatively prime.

If  x  and   y  are  not  relatively  prime,   then  there  exists    some  n  >  1  such   that  x  and  y
                                                                                                  n       n

are    integers.  It  follows  that   x+y  is  also  an  integer,  and  so  x+y   is  neither  relatively
                                        n

prime to x nor to y. Since this is the contrapositive statement of claim 2, we have

completed the proof.

Remark. Notice that [7.28] cannot be written using an "if and only if " statement
without discarding part of the result.

Proposition 7.29. PRIME NUMBERS I.

If p is prime and p  y, then p, y are relatively prime.

Proof. Assume instead there exists some positive integer n > 1 such that n|p and
n|y.
Since n|y and p  y, n = p. But since n|p where n > 1 and p is a prime number, n = p,
a contradiction. This proves our claim.

Proposition 7.30. PRIME NUMBERS II.

Suppose x and y are natural numbers and p is a prime number. If p is a factor of
xy, then p is a factor of either x or y.

Proof. Since p is a factor of xy, there exists some positive integer n > 1 such that

np = xy. By [7.19],                              py
                                                   =

                                                 xn

Suppose that p is not a factor of x; by [7.29], p and x are relatively prime. By [7.21],

p  is  written  in  lowest  terms;  by  [7.20],  p  is  a  factor  of  y.
x

Similarly, we can show that if p is not a factor of y, then p is a factor of x. This
proves our claim.

Lemma. 7.30.0 If S is any nonempty set of natural numbers, then any subset of S
contains a minimum element.

Proposition 7.31. PRIME NUMBERS III.

Let x be any composite number. There exists some prime number p such that p is a
factor of x.

Proof. Since x is composite, there exists some number y1 < x which is a proper
factor of x. If y1 is prime, then the proof is complete. Otherwise, suppose y2 < y1
is a proper factor of y1. Clearly, y2 is also a proper factor of x; if y2 is prime, then
the proof is complete. Otherwise, we continue this algorithm to obtain the set of
natural numbers Y = {x, y1, y2, y3, ...} where x > y1 > y2 > ....
338  CHAPTER 7. ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY

By [Lemma 7.30.0], Y contains a minimum element, yk. Since there exists no yk+1 
Y such that yk+1 < yk, it follows that yk is not composite. By [Def. 7.1.3] and [Def.
7.1.11], yk is a prime number. Hence yk = p and is a factor of x.

Proposition 7.32. PRIME NUMBERS IV.

Any natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or a composite of
primes.

Proof. Suppose x > 1 is a natural number that is neither prime nor a composite of
primes. Consider the factors of x: if x = 1 · x is the only possible factoring, then
x is prime, a contradiction. Otherwise, by repeated applications of [7.31], x = a · b
where a and b are primes, also a contradiction.
Therefore, x is either prime or a composite of primes, which completes the proof.

Remark. See also the Sieve of Eratosthenes4.

Proposition 7.33. FINDING RATIOS IN LOWEST TERMS.

Given natural numbers a, b, c and the ratio a : b : c, we may find the ratio d : e : f
such that a : b : c = d : e : f where no smaller integers exist that make this equality
true.5

Proof. If a, b, and c are relatively prime, then let a = d, b = e, and c = f , and our
claim is proven [7.21].
Otherwise, by [7.3] a, b, and c have a greatest common factor g. Let gd = a, ge = b,
and gf = c. Hence, a : b : c = d : e : f .
We now wish to show that no smaller natural numbers exist which make this equal-
ity true.
Suppose d, e, and f are not the least such natural numbers; instead, suppose h, j,
and k are respectively less than d, e, and f such that a : b : c = h : j : k. Hence there
exists positive integer m such that mh = a, mj = b, and mk = c.
Suppose m = g; since gd = a = mh, h = d, contradicting our hypothesis that h < d.
Now suppose m < g; since gd = a = mh, it follows that h > d, also a contradiction.
Finally, suppose m > g; then g is not the greatest common factor of a, b, and c, a
contradiction.
It follows that d, e, and f are the least such natural numbers, completing the proof.

Proposition 7.34. LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE I.

Given x and y, we claim that a smallest positive integer exists which has x and y
as factors. This is number is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of x and y.

Proof. We shall prove our claim in two cases.

Case 1: x and y are relatively prime.

Since x and y each divide xy, we claim that xy is the smallest positive integer which
has x and y as a factor.

If not, suppose that x and y divide some integer d < xy, and there exist natural

numbers e > 1 and f > 1 such that ex = d and f y = d. It follows that ex = f y and
yx = ef .

Since     x    and   y  are      relatively  prime,  x   is  written  in   lowest      terms  by  [7.21];  since
                                                     y

x   =  ef ,  by [7.20] x is a factor of f ,      and by [7.20.1] y         is a factor of e.      And so there
y

exist natural numbers m > 1 and n > 1 such that mx = f and ny = e; thus,

mxy = f y = d.              Since d < xy and xy =            dm , we obtain d <        d      when    m  >  1,    a
                                                                                       m

contradiction. Therefore, xy is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of x and y.

Case 2: x and y are not relatively prime.

Let    e  >    1  and   f   >    1  be  natural  numbers     such   that   x   =    f  where   f  is  written     in
                                                                           y        e          e

lowest terms. It follows that xe = yf . We claim that xe is the the smallest positive

integer which has x and y as a factor.

Otherwise, x and y divide some d < xe, and there exists some positive integer g > 1

such that xg = d and some positive integer h > 1 such that yh = d. It follows that

xg  =     yh,  and   so  x  =    hg .
                         y

Notice    that    f  =     hg .  Since  f  are  written  in  least  terms  of  all  fractions  equaling     xy ,  by
                  e                     e

[7.20.1] e divides g. Hence, e < g.

But xg < xe above, and so g < e, a contradiction. Thus, xe = yf is the LCM of x and
y.

Example. [7.34.1]: consider 6 and 14. Numbers which have 6 and 14 as factors
include 42, 82, 168, and so on. Notice that

                                                     63
                                                         =

                                                     14 7

By [7.34], the LCM of 6 and 14 is

                                       6 · 7 = 14 · 3 = 2 · 3 · 7 = 42
340  CHAPTER 7. ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY

Proposition 7.35. LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE II.

Let a be the least common multiple of x and y. If x and y divide z, then a also
divides z.

Proof. Suppose that z = kxy. Clearly, x and y divide z. If x and y are relatively
prime, then by [7.34] a = xy and so a divides z.
If x and y are not relatively prime, then also by [7.34] a = xe where e is a factor of
y. If y = em, then

                                    z = kxy = kx (em) = a · km

and so a divides z. This completes the proof.

Example. [7.35]: 6 and 14 are each factors of 168. Therefore, 42 is also a factor of
168. In fact, 168/42 = 4.

Proposition 7.36. LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE III.

If x, y, and z are natural numbers, then the least common multiple of x, y, and z
exists.

Proof. Let d be the least common multiple of x and y. Either z divides d or it does
not.
Claim 1: if z|d, then d is the least common multiple of x, y, and z.
To see this, suppose instead that x, y, and z divide e < d where e is a natural
number. By [7.35], d|e, or d < e, a contradiction. This proves our claim.

Claim 2: if z  d and if e is the smallest natural number such that both d and z are
factors, then e is the least common multiple of x, y, and z.
Let e be defined as above. Since x|d and y|d, we see that e is a common multiple of
x, y, and z.
If e is not the least common multiple of x, y, and z, then some natural numer f
exists such that f < e where x|f , y|f , and z|f . By [7.35], d|f . Since e is the smallest
natural number such that both d and z are factors, e < f , a contradiction.
This completes the proof.
7.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VII  341

Example. [7.36]: Consider 6, 15, and 21. The LCM of 6 and 15 is 30. Since 21 is
not a factor of 30, we need the LCM of 21 and 30, which is 210. By [7.36], 210 is the
LCM of 6, 15, and 21.

If we were to list the multiples of 6, 15, and 21 instead of following [7.36], we would
obtain:

Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108,

Proposition 7.37. FACTORING I.
Let x, y, and z be natural numbers. If x is a factor of y, then there exists a natural
number z such that y/x = z.
Proof. Suppose kx = y for some natural number k. Then k = xy . Let k = z, and the

Proposition 7.38. FACTORING II.

Let x, y, and z be natural numbers where y/x = z; then x is a factor of y.

Proof. Suppose that                                    y
                                                         =z

                                                       x

It follows that y = xz, and so x is a factor of y.

Corollary. 7.38.1 Let x, y, and z be natural numbers. [7.37] and [7.38] state that
y/x = z iff x is a factor of y.

Proposition 7.39. FACTORING III.

Suppose x, y, and z are natural numbers. We claim a smallest positive integer a

exists    such  that    ax ,  ay ,  and  a  are  natural  numbers.
                                         z

Proof. Suppose x, y, and z are natural numbers. Let g be the smallest positive

integer that has x, y, and z as factors.                  It     follows  that     xg ,  yg ,  and  g     are   natural
                                                                                                    z

numbers. We claim that g = a.

If  this  is  not  the  case,       there   exists  a  positive  integer  h  <  g  such  that       hx ,  hy ,  and  h  are
                                                                                                                     z

natural numbers. It follows that h has x, y, and z as factors. But g is the smallest

positive integer that has x, y, and z as factors, and so g < h, a contradiction.

Therefore, g = a, which completes the proof.

Proportions & Geometric
Sequences

In this chapter, all variables a, b, c, etc., are assumed to be natural numbers unless
otherwise noted.

8.1 Definitions

1. A continued proportion may be written as:

                                       1 : 2 = 2 : 4 = 4 : 8 = 8 : 16
or

                                              124 8
                                                 ===

                                              2 4 8 16
When simplified, each term equals 12 , but we refrain from simplifying the ratios
because that would eliminate the continued proportion (which works as if opposing
denominators and numerators are links in a chain).
Continued proportions such as the example above may be said to be written in
lowest possible terms. This is different from being written in lowest terms: the
equations above written in lowest terms become

                                        1:2=1:2=1:2=1:2
but are no longer a continued proportion.
A continued proportion is equivalent to a geometric progression (any theorem re-
garding one also applies to the other). A continued proportion with a constant ratio
will be an important topic in this chapter.

                                                  1, 2, 4, 8, 16

2. A geometric progression1, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of
numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one
by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2,
6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 40, 20, 10,
5, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.
Examples of a geometric sequence are powers rk of a fixed number r, such as 2k
and 3k. The general form of a geometric sequence is:

                                            a, ar, ar2, ar3, ar4, ...

where r = 0 is the common ratio and a is a scale factor, equal to the sequence's
starting value. In many of Euclid's propositions, a = 1.

3.  Suppose  a  =  b·c  and  d  =  e·f  where    b  :  c  =  e   :  f  (equivalently,  b  =  ef ).  We  say
                                                                                       c

that a and d are similar or write a  d. (Euclid describes a and d as similar plane

numbers.)

4. Similarly, if g = h · i · j and k = l · m · n where h : i : j = l : m : n (where
h : i : j = l : m : n is equivalent to h : l = i : m = j : n). We say that g and k are
similar or write g  k. (Euclid describes g and k as similar solid numbers.)

5. When three numbers can be written as continued proportions, the first is said to
have to the third the duplicate ratio of that which it has to the second.

8.2 Propositions from Book VIII

Proposition 8.1. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS I.                                                  (8.2.1)
Suppose we have a continued proportion of natural numbers such that

                                  x1 : x2 = x2 : x3 = . . . = xn-1 : xn

and where x1 and xn are relatively prime, and where each fraction equals some

rational number         s  > 0.    Then for 2  i  n, each xi-1            : xi is written in lowest
                        t

possible terms.

Proof.  Our hypothesis is stated above.            We claim that each     xi-1      for 2  i  n is
                                                                           xi

written in the lowest possible terms.

Assume otherwise: let

                                   y1 : y2 = y2 : y3 = . . . = yn-1 : yn                   (8.2.2)

be  a  set  of  ratios  such  that  each  term     equals  s  and  is  written  in  lower  terms  than
                                                           t

in equation (8.2.1). It follows that y1 < x1.

By   [7.14],    it  follows  that  x1  =  y1 yn .  Recall that x1 and xn are relatively prime;
                                   xn

by [7.21],      x1  is written in least terms.     And by [7.20], x1 is a factor of y1, and so
                xn

x1 < y1. But y1 < x1, a contradiction. Thus (8.2.1) is written in lower terms than

(8.2.2). Since (8.2.2) was chosen arbitrarily, (8.2.1) is written in lowest possible

terms. which completes the proof.

Example. 8.1.1. Consider the continued proportion

                              16 : 40 = 40 : 100 = 100 : 250 = 250 : 625

[8.1] guarantees that since 16 and 625 are relatively prime, each ratio is written in
lowest possible terms. (If each ratio were written in lowest terms, they would each
equal 2 : 5.)
8.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VIII                                                               347

Proposition 8.2. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS II.

If  x  is  written  in  lowest  terms,  then     there  exists  a  continued  proportion       written  in
    y

lowest possible terms where each term equals xy .

Proof. Notice that for any positive integer n  2 each term in the following contin-
ued proportion equals xy :

                           xn          xn-1 · y           x2 · yn-2 x · yn-1                   (8.2.3)
                        xn-1 · y = xn-2 · y2 = . . . = x · yn-1 = yn

We claim that the ratios in (8.2.3) are written in the lowest possible terms.

Since      x  is  written  in  lowest  terms,  by  [Cor.  7.22.1]  x  and  y  are  relatively  prime.  By
           y

[Cor. 7.27.1], xn and yn are relatively prime. Notice that we may write (8.2.3) as

                                xn : xn-1 · y = ... = x · yn-1 : yn

By [8.1], each term in (8.2.3) is written in the lowest possible terms. This completes
the proof.

Remark. Euclid's original proof of [8.2] only covers the cases where n = 2 and n = 3.

Corollary. 8.2.1 If we write the continued proportion (8.2.3) as a list of numbers,
we obtain a1, a2, ..., an-1, an where a1 = xn-1 and an = yn-1 for natural numbers x
and y.

Example. 8.2.1. Using equation (8.2.3) where x = 2, y = 5, and n = 4, we obtain
                              16 : 40 = 40 : 100 = 100 : 250 = 250 : 625

The details are left as an exercise to the reader. This continued proportion can also
be written as the geometric progression 16, 40, 100, 250, 625.
348                       CHAPTER 8. PROPORTIONS & GEOMETRIC SEQUENCES

Proposition 8.3. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS III.

Suppose we have a continued proportion of natural numbers

                               x1 : x2 = x2 : x3 = . . . = xn-1 : xn

where each ratio is written in lowest possible terms. Then x1 and xn are relatively
prime.

Proof. Suppose z1/z2 is written in lowest terms. By [9.2], there exists the continued

proportion

                            n       n-1                      2 n-2         z1 · z2n-1
                          z1        z1 · z2
                        n-1 = n-2 2 = . . . =              z1 · z2                                    (8.2.4)
                                                                  n-1 =
                     z1 · z2 z1 · z2                       z1 · z2               z2n

written in lowest possible terms.

By  [Cor.  7.27.2],  zn   and  zn   are  relatively   prime.  Let   x1  =  z1n,  each  xi   =  z1n-i+1  ·  z2i-1

                       1         2

for 2  i  n - 1, and xn = z2n, and our proof is complete.

Example. 8.3.1. Consider the continued proportion
                              16 : 40 = 40 : 100 = 100 : 250 = 250 : 625

Each ratio is written in lowest possible terms, and so 16 and 625 are relatively
prime.

Corollary. 8.3.1. Suppose we have a continued proportion of natural numbers such
that

                                  x1 : x2 = x2 : x3 = . . . = xn-1 : xn

By  [8.1]  and  [8.3],  we  find  that   x1  and  xn  are  relatively   prime    iff  each  xi-1  is  written
                                                                                             xi

in lowest possible terms (for 2  i  n).

Proposition 8.4. CONTINUED RATIOS I.

Write a : b, c : d, and e : f in lowest terms. There exists a continued ratio x1 : x2 :
x3 : x4 written in lowest possible terms where xx12 = ab , xx23 = dc , and xx34 = fe .

Proof. Suppose a : b, c : d, and e : f are written in lowest terms.

Let l1 = mb = nc be the least common multiple of b and c. Then write

                                         a = ma and c = nc
                                         b mb              d nd

Let l2 = pnd = qe be the least common multiple of nd and e. Then write

                                a = pma , c = pnc , and e = qe
                                b pmb d pnd                        f qf

Notice that pmb = pnc. We claim that pma : pmb : qe : qf is the required continued
ratio.

If it is not, there exists a continued ratio x : y : z : u written in least possible terms

exists such that                x1 = x , x2 = y , and x3 = z

                                x2 y x3 z                          x4 u

Since   a  is in lowest terms and        a  =      xy , b is a factor of y [7.21].  Similarly,  c  is in
        b                                b                                                      d

lowest  terms  and  c  =  zy ,  and  so  c  is  a  factor  of  y.
                    d

By [7.35], l1, the least common multiple of b and c, is also a factor of y.

Notice that                          x2 = y = c = nc = l1
                                     x3 z d nd nd

Since l1 is a factor of y, nd is a factor of z. And since
                                                     ez
                                                        =
                                                     fu

e is also a factor of z. Again by [7.35], l2, the least common multiple of nd and e,
is also a factor of z; or, l2 < z. But l2 = pnd and l2 = pnd < z since x : y : z : u is
written in least possible terms.

Thus, pma : pmb : qe : qf is the required continued ratio, which completes the
proof.

Example. 8.4.1. Suppose we have the ratios 1 : 2, 2 : 5, and 3 : 4. The required
continued ratio is 3 : 6 : 15 : 20 since 3 : 6 = 1 : 2, 6 : 15 = 2 : 5, and 15 : 20 = 3 : 4.

Proposition 8.6. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS IV.

Let x1 : x2 = x2 : x3 = . . . = xn-1 : xn be a continued proportion. If x1 does not
divide x2, then xj does not divide xk whenever j < k  n.

Proof. We shall prove the contrapositive statement of the above: if xj divides xk
whenever j < k  n, then x1 divides x2.
Suppose that xj divides xk whenever j < k  n. Since 1 < 2  n, x1 divides x2,
which completes the proof.

Proposition 8.7. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS V.

Let x1 : x2 = x2 : x3 = . . . = xn-1 : xn be a continued proportion. If x1 divides xn,
then x1 divides x2.

Proof. Consider the contrapositive statement of [8.6]: if xj divides xk whenever
j < k  n, then x1 divides x2. Since 1 < n  n, [8.6] implies: if x1 divides xn, then
x1 divides x2. This completes the proof.
8.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VIII                     351

Proposition 8.8. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS VI.

Let a : b = e : f , and construct a continued proportion

                                    a : a1 = a1 : a2 = . . . = an-1 : b

(with n - 1 middle terms) where each term equals ab . Then there exists a continued
proportion

                                     e : e1 = e1 : e2 = . . . = en-1 : f
(also with n - 1 middle terms) where each term equals ef .

Proof. Let

            c : c1 = c1 : c2 = ... = cn-1 : d

be the continued proportion

            a : a1 = a1 : a2 = . . . = an-1 : b

written in the lowest possible terms.

By [8.3], c and d are relatively prime. By [7.21], c : d is written in lowest terms.
Notice that a : b = c : d. By hypothesis, a : b = e : f , and so c : d = e : f . By [7.20], it
follows that e = mc, f = md where m > 0 is an integer. Then

            mc : mc1 = mc1 : mc2 = ... = mcn-1 : md

is a continued proportion with n - 1 middle terms where each term equals mc :
md = e : f . Let e = mc, e1 = mc1, ..., and f = md, and the proof is complete.

Remark. David E. Joyce points out that [8.8] and [10.9] can be used to prove that
2 is not a rational number.2

Proposition 8.9. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS VII.

Let a and b be relatively prime, and suppose there exists n geometric means be-
tween a and b; then there exist n geometric means between 1 and a and between 1
and b.

Proof. Our hypothesis and claim are stated above. Suppose that a1, a2, . . ., an-2 are
the geometric means between a and b; equivalently, suppose we have the continued
proportion

                                    a : a1 = a1 : a2 = . . . = an-2 : b

352                  CHAPTER 8. PROPORTIONS & GEOMETRIC SEQUENCES

Since a and b are relatively prime by hypothesis, by [8.1] each ai-1 : ai for 2  i 
n - 2 is written in lowest possible terms.
By [Cor 8.2.1], the terms of this continued proportion are respectively equal to the
terms cn+1, cn · d, cn-1 · d2, . . ., c · dn, dn+1 where c and d are written in lowest terms.
Then a = cn+1 and b = dn+1 and the continued proportions

                                1 : c = c : c2 = c2 : c3 = . . . = cn : cn+1

                               1 : d = d : d2 = d2 : d3 = . . . = dn : dn+1

exist with n geometric terms between 1 and c and between 1 and d. This completes
the proof.

Example. 8.9.1. Using equation (8.2.3)

                     xn  xn-1 · y         x2 · yn-2 x · yn-1
     xn-1 · y = xn-2 · y2 = . . . = x · yn-1 = yn

where x = 2, y = 5, and n = 4, we obtain

                     16 : 40 = 40 : 100 = 100 : 250 = 250 : 625

By [8.9], we obtain           1 : 2 = 2 : 4 = 4 : 8 = 8 : 16
and                      1 : 5 = 5 : 25 = 25 : 125 = 125 : 625

Proposition 8.10. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS VIII.

Suppose there exists n geometric means between 1 and a and between 1 and b; then
there exists n geometric means between a and b.

Proof. Suppose the following continued proportions exist:

                                1 : c = c : c2 = c2 : c3 = . . . = cn : cn+1

                               1 : d = d : d2 = d2 : d3 = . . . = dn : dn+1
We claim that a continued proportion beginning with a = cn+1 and ending with
b = dn+1 exists with n terms in-between.
Multiply term n + 1 in the first proportion by term 1 in the second proportion. Then
multiply term n in the first proportion by term 2 in the second proportion. Repeat
this algorithm until we have a total of n + 1 products, giving us:

                               cn+1, cn · d, cn-1 · d2, . . . , c · dn, dn+1
8.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VIII                                  353

Clearly, we may write a continued proportion with these terms; notice that this
proportion has n means between a = cn+1 and b = dn+1, which completes the
proof.

Remark. [2.10] is only a partial converse of [2.9]: [2.9] requires that a and b be
relatively prime, but [2.10] does not.

Proposition 8.11. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS IX.

Let a and b be natural numbers. Then a2 and b2 have one and only one geometric
mean (ab).

Proof. Our hypothesis and claim are stated above. Notice that if

                      a2          x
                      x = b2

then

                      (ab)2 = x2
                         ab = x

since a, b, x are natural numbers. It follows that ab is a geometric mean of a2 and
b2.

Suppose that c and d are natural numbers such that cd is also a geometric mean of
a2 and b2. Then ab = cd, and so ab is unique. This completes the proof.

                                           b = a2b = ab2 = b3

Corollary. 8.12.1 Let an and bn be natural numbers for any positive integer n  1.
Then there exist a set of geometric means to an and bn such that

Proof. If a1 : a2 = a2 : a3 = . . . = an-1 : an, then

                                            a1 = a2 = ... = an-1
                                            a2 a3                  an

We may continue this procedure finitely many times until we obtain

                              ( a1 )k ( a2 )k                      ( an-1 )k

This completes our proof.

Proposition 8.14. FACTORS OF POWERS I.

1. If a2 is a factor of b2, then a is a factor of b.
2. If a is a factor of b, then a2 is a factor of b2.

Proof. Suppose a2 is a factor of b2. Then b2 = k2 · a2 where k is a positive real
number. Hence, b = ka; or, a is a factor of b.

Now suppose that a is a factor of b. Then b = k · a where k is a positive real number,
and

                                           b2 = (k · a)2 = k2 · a2

Therefore, a2 is a factor of b2.

Remark. Euclid proves this hypothesis using [8.7]. However, it can be more easily
demonstrated via algebra.

Proposition 8.15. FACTORS OF POWERS II.
1. If a3 is a factor of b3, then a is a factor of b.
2. If a is a factor of b, then a3 is a factor of b3.
Proof. The proof is similar to that of [8.14] and is left as an exercise to the reader.

Corollary. 8.15.1 For any positive integer n, an is a factor of bn iff a is a factor of b.

Proposition 8.16. FACTORS OF POWERS III.
1. If a2 is not a factor of b2, then a is not a factor of b.
2. If a is not a factor of b, then a2 is not a factor of b2.

Proof. Claim 1 is the contrapositive statement of [8.14], claim 2.
Claim 2 is the contrapositive statement of [8.14], claim 1.
356                     CHAPTER 8. PROPORTIONS & GEOMETRIC SEQUENCES

Proposition 8.17. FACTORS OF POWERS IV.

1. If a3 is not a factor of b3, then a is not a factor of b.
2. If a is not a factor of b, then a3 is not a factor of b3.

Proof. Claim 1 is the the contrapositive statement of [8.15], claim 2.
Claim 2 is the contrapositive statement of [8.15], claim 1.

Corollary. 8.17.1 For any positive integer n, an is not a factor of bn iff a is not a
factor of b. This is the contrapositive statement of [Cor. 8.15.1].

Proposition 8.18. GEOMETRIC MEANS I.

If ab and cd are "similar plane numbers", i.e., products of factors a, b, c, and d such
that a : b = c : d, then there exists one mean proportional between ab and cd. Also,
ab is to cd in the duplicate ratio of a to c or of b to d.

Proof. By [7.13],       ac ab
Furthermore,            b=d c=d

                             ab bc
                                 =

                             bc cd

Hence, bc is a geometric mean between ab and cd. If x is also a geometric mean
between ab and cd, then x2 = (bc)2 = abcd, and so x = bc; hence, bc is unique.

And  since  a  =  bd ,  ( a )2 ab ( b )2
            c

                           ==
                        c  cd d

By [Def. 8.5], ab is to cd in the duplicate ratio of a to c or of b to d. This completes
the proof.
8.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK VIII                                      357

Proposition 8.19. GEOMETRIC MEANS II.

If a : b : c = d : e : f , then there exist two geometric means between abc and def
(specifically, bcd and cde). Also, abc is to def in the triplicate ratio of a : d.

Proof. Our hypothesis and claim are stated above. Recall that a : b : c = d : e : f iff
a : d = b : e = c : f.
Notice that a : d = abc : bcd, that b : e = bcd : cde, and that c : f = cde : def . Hence,

                                              abc bcd cde
                                                   ==

                                              bcd cde def

and so two geometric means, bcd and cde, exist between abc and def .

Since ad = be = cf ,  a b c ( a )3 abc
                      d · e · f = d = def

By [Def. 8.6], this completes the proof.

Proposition 8.20. GEOMETRIC MEANS III.

If a, c, and b are in geometrical progression, then a and b each have two factors and
are similar.

Proof. Suppose                            ac
                                            =

                                          cb

We claim that a and b are similar and that each have two factors.

Let  :  be the ratios a : c and c : b reduced to lowest terms. By [7.20], a = m,
c = m = n, and b = n where m > 0 and n > 0. Hence, a and b each have two
factors.

Finally, notice that   a c m m
                         === =

                       c b n n

By [7.13], m :  = n : . By [Def 8.3], a = m and b = n are similar.
358                     CHAPTER 8. PROPORTIONS & GEOMETRIC SEQUENCES

Proposition 8.21. GEOMETRIC MEANS IV.

If a, c, d, and b are in geometrical progression, then a and b each have three factors
and are similar.

Proof. Suppose

                                        acd
                                          ==

                                        cdb

We claim that a and b each have three factors and are similar.

By [7.33] or [8.2], let  :  :  be the progression a : c : d written in lowest possible
terms. By [8.3],  and  are relatively prime; by [8.20],  and  are similar and
each have two factors. Let  = mn and  = pq where m : n = p : q. It follows that
 = mq = np.

Notice that                      mn m mn n
                                   = == =

                                 np p mq q

Since  a  =  c  =    =   ,  we  obtain
       c     d     
                                        a
                                          =

                                        d

Since  and  are relatively prime, a = r and d = r. But  = mn and  = pq, and
so a = rmn.

Since  c  =  d  =    =   ,  we  obtain
       d     b     
                                        c
                                          =

                                        b

and so c = s and b = s; or, c = smn and b = spq. Hence, a = rmn and b = spq have
three factors. Notice that

                                         a rmn r
                                        ==    =
                                         c smn s

Taken with the above, we obtain
                                              rmn
                                                 == =
                                              s p q

Hence, a and b are similar, completing the proof.

Proposition 8.22. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS XII.

If  a  =  b  and   a  =  k2  for  some  k  >  0,  then   c  =  n2.
    b     c

Proof. By [8.20], a and c are each the product of two factors, and a is similar to c.
Let a = kk and c = ns. Then we may obtain

                                                  k:n=k:s

For this equality to occur, n = s. It follows that c = n2 for some integer s.

Proposition 8.23. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS XIII.

If  a  =  b  =  c  and   a  =  n3  for  some  n   >  0,  then  d  =  s3.
    b     c     d

Proof. By [8.21], a and d are each the product of three factors, and a is similar to d.
Let a = nnn and d = spq. Then

                                           n:s=n:p=n:q

For this equality to occur, s = p = q. It follows that d = s3 for some integer s.

Proposition 8.24. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS XIV.

If a : b = c2 : d2 and a = s2 for some s > 0, then b = t2.

Proof. Reduce a : b to lowest terms if it is not so already. By [Cor. 7.20.1], b is a
factor of d2. Suppose d2 = k2 · b for some natural k. If b is a not a square number,
then d is not a natural number, a contradiction. Hence b = t2 for some natural t.

Proposition 8.25. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS XV.
If a : b = c3 : d3 and a = s3 for some s > 0, then b = t3.
Proof. By [8.19], c3 : d3 has two mean proportionals. By [8.8], a : b also has two
mean proportionals. By [8.23], since a = s3 for some s > 0, then b = t3 for some
t > 0.

Proposition 8.26. RATIOS OF SQUARE NUMBERS.

Similar numbers which each have two factors have the same ratio to each other as
a square number has to a square number.
360  CHAPTER 8. PROPORTIONS & GEOMETRIC SEQUENCES

Proof. If a and b are similar numbers each with two factors, let c be the mean
proportional between them [8.18].

Take , , and  as the smallest terms in the ratio of a, c, and b by either [7.33] or
[8.2].

By [Cor. 8.2.1],  and  are square numbers. It follows that a and b have a ratio to
each other as a square number has to a square number.

Example. 8.26.1 Consider 21 and 189. Since 21 = 3 · 7 and 189 = 9 · 21 where
                                                     39
                                                       =
                                                     7 21

21  189. Also notice that        21 63
                                     =

                                 63 189

If we simply this equality into least possible terms, we obtain

                                 1  =  3

                                 3     9

or                         12 3

                                       21 63
                           3 = 32  63 = 189

Corollary. 8.26.1 If two numbers have a ratio to each other as a square number to
a square number, then the numbers are similar plane numbers.

Proposition 8.27. RATIOS OF CUBED NUMBERS.

Similar numbers which each have three factors have a ratio to each other as a
cubed number has to a cubed number.

Proof. The proof to [8.27] is similar to the proof to [8.26] except that [8.19] is cited
instead of [8.18].

Corollary. 8.27.1 If two numbers have to one another the ratio of a cubed number
to a cubed number, the numbers are similar cubed numbers.

In this chapter, all variables a, b, c, etc., are assumed to be natural numbers unless
otherwise noted.

9.1 Definitions

1. The sigma function of a positive integer n is the sum of the positive factors of n.

This  function  is  denoted  (n).  If  the  prime  factorization   of    n  =  xs   ·  xt   ·  ...  ·  xzm,  then

                                                                                 1       2

(n) and can be calculated in this way:

                (n) = (xs1 · x2t · ... · xzm)

                    = (xs1) · (xt2) · ... · (xzm)

                    =        ( x1s+1 - 1 ) ( x2t+1 - 1 )· · ... ·  ( z+1 )
                                                                     xm - 1

Example: 45 = 1 · 45 = 3 · 15 = 5 · 9, and so

For any prime number p, (p) = p + 1.

                                          ( 72 - 1 )

                                    (6) = (2) · (3)
                                                  ( 22 - 1 ) ( 32 - 1 )

                                            = 2-1 · 3-1

                                                     ()()
                                                       38

                                               = 1·2

                                               = 3·4
                                               = 12
                                               = 1+2+3+6
                                               = 2(6)

The sigma function is also multiplicative; that is, f (nm) = f (n) · f (m) whenever m
and n are relatively prime. This function used in the proof to [9.36].

Proposition 9.1. PRODUCT OF SIMILAR PLANE NUMBERS.

If two similar plane numbers are multiplied, their product will be a square number.

Proof. Suppose a  b are plane numbers. We claim that ab is a square number.

Notice that                                  a a2
                                               =

                                             b ab

By [8.18], there exists one mean proportional between a and b. By [8.8], there exists
one mean proportional between a2 and ab. By [8.22], ab is a square number.

Example. [10.1.1] Let a = 21 and b = 189. Since a = 3 · 7, b = 9 · 21, and
                                                     39
                                                       =
                                                     7 21

a and b are similar numbers. [9.1] states that ab = 3969 is a square number, and


  3969 = 63.

Remark. An algebraic proof: suppose a = x · y and b = kx · ky. Since

                                             x kx
                                               =

                                             y ky

a  and  b  are  similar  numbers.  Then  ab  =  x  ·  y  ·  kx  ·  ky  =  k2x2y2,  and  so        =  kxy.
                                                                                              ab

Proposition 9.2. CONVERSE OF PROPOSITION 9.1

If the product of two natural numbers is a square number, then the numbers are
similar plane numbers.

Proof. Let a and b be natural numbers such that ab = c2. We claim that a and b are
similar plane numbers.
Clearly, a2 is a square number, and

                                                     a a2
                                                       =

                                                     b ab

Since ab = c2 by hypothesis, notice that

     a                                    =  a

     ab                                      ab

     a                                    =  ab

     a                                       ab

     a                                    =  c

     a                                       c

and so a2  c2. By [8.18], one mean proportional exists between a2 and ab = c2. By
[8.8], one mean proportional exists between a and b.

By [8.20], if one mean proportional exists between a and b, then a and b are similar
plane numbers. This proves our claim.

Example. 9.2.1. Since 10 · 40 = 400 and 400 = 202, it follows that 10 and 40 are
similar plane numbers: 10 = 2 · 5, 40 = 4 · 10, and

                                                     24
                                                       =

                                                     5 10

Corollary. 9.2.1. Given that a, b, and c are natural numbers, a and b are similar
plane numbers iff a · b = c2.

Proposition 9.3. EXPONENTS I.

The product of a cubic number with itself is also a cubic number.

Proof. Using the standard properties of exponents, we obtain
                                         (x3)(x3) = (x3)2 = (x2)3

Proposition 9.4. EXPONENTS II.
If k = a3b3, then k is a cubic number.
Proof. Since a3b3 = (ab)3 = k, the proof follows.

Proposition 9.5. EXPONENTS III.
If a3b = r3, then b = k3.

Proof. Suppose a3b = r3. By [9.3], a3 · a3 = t3 for some t, and so

a3 · a3                                         a3
                               a3b = b

                                 t3             a3
                                 r3 = b

Applying [8.19], there exist two geometric means between t3 and r3. By [8.8], there
exist two geometric means between a3 and b. By [8.23], b = k3 for some k.

Corollary. 9.5.1. Suppose a3b = c. By [9.4] and [9.5], b is a cubic number if and
only if c is a cubic number.

Proposition 9.6. EXPONENTS IV.
If a2 = t3 for some t, than a = k3 for some k.
368  CHAPTER 9. APPLIED NUMBER THEORY

Proof. Suppose a2 = t3 for some t. Notice that
                                             1 a a2 t3
                                             a = a2 = a3 = a3

By [8.19], there exist two mean proportionals between t3 and a3. By [8.8], there
exist two mean proportionals between a and a2. By [8.23], since a2 = t3 for some t,
a = k3 for some k.

Example. 9.6.1. If x2 = 64 = 43, then x = 23 = 8.

Proposition 9.7. SOLID NUMBERS.

Euclid refers to natural numbers with two factors as "plane numbers" and natural
numbers with three factors as "solid numbers". This proposition states that by
multiplying ab (a plane number) by c, we obtain abc (a solid number). Algebraically,
the proposition is self-evident.

Proposition 9.8. EXPONENTS OF GEOMETRICAL SEQUENCES I.

If 1, a1, a2, a3, . . ., ak is a geometrical sequence, then the a2n terms have exponents
which are multiples of 2, the a3n terms have exponents which are multiples of 3,
and the a6n terms have exponents which are multiples of 6.

Proof. Suppose that 1 : a1 = a1 : a2 = a2 : a3 = . . . = ak-1 : ak is a geometrical
sequence. It follows that a1 = r, a2 = r2, a3 = r3, a4 = r4, ..., ak = rk. Clearly,
a2n = r2n, a3n = r3n, and a6n = r6n.
This result holds when the continued proportion is multiplied by a constant scale
factor [Def 8.2], which completes the proof.

Proposition 9.9. EXPONENTS OF GEOMETRICAL SEQUENCES II.

If 1, a1, a2, a3, . . ., an is a geometrical sequence where:
(1) a1 = k2 for some natural number k, then a2, ..., an are also square numbers.
(2) a1 = k3 for some natural number k, then a2, ..., an are also cubic numbers.

Proof. Let 1, a1, a2, a3, . . ., an be a geometrical sequence.
9.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IX                                                          369

(1) By hypothesis and [9.8], a1 = r = k2. Hence for m  2,

                           am = rm = (k2)m = (km)2

(2) By hypothesis and [9.8], a1 = r = k3. Hence for m  2,
                                        am = rm = (k3)m = (km)3

This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.10. EXPONENTS OF GEOMETRICAL SEQUENCES III.

If 1, a1, a2, a3, . . ., an is a geometrical sequence where:

(1) a1 = k2 for some natural number k, then a2s are square numbers and all other
terms of the sequence are not square numbers.

(2) a1 = k3 for some natural number k, then a3m are cubic numbers and all other
terms of the sequence are not cubic numbers.

Proof. Let 1, a1, a2, a3, . . ., an be a geometrical sequence.
(1) Suppose a1 = x2 for any x and that a3 = k2 for some k. Since a2 = (a1)2, a2 = s2
for some natural number s. Notice that

                             a1 a2 s2
                                 = =2

                             a2 a3 k

We may rewrite the above as

                             s2 k2
                             a1 = s2

By [8.24], a1 = x2 for some x, contradicting our hypothesis. By a similar argument,

all other terms of the sequence are not square numbers.

(2) The proof is similar to that of case (1) and is left as an exercise to the reader.

Proposition 9.11. EXPONENTS OF GEOMETRICAL SEQUENCES IV.

Let s < t. Euclid's original proposition and its corollary state that as is a factor of
at a total of at-s times. Equivalently, this may be written as

                                                as · at-s = at

If we take the rules of exponents as axiomatic1, [9.11] becomes self-evident.

Proposition 9.12. PRIMES AND GEOMETRICAL SEQUENCES I.

Let 1, a1, a2, . . ., an be terms in a geometrical progression, and let p be a prime
number. If p is a factor of an, then p is also a factor of a1.

Proof. A proof by contradiction: assume that prime number p is a factor of an but p
is not a factor of a1.

By [7.29], a1 and p are relatively prime. By hypothesis, an = mp. Since 1, a1, a2, . . .,
an is a geometrical progression, by [9.11], an = a1 · an-1. So

                                      mp = a1 · an-1 or a1 = m
                                                               p an-1

Since a1 and p are relatively prime, by [7.21] and [7.20] p is a factor of an-1. Re-
peating this algorithm a finite number of times, we can show that p is a factor of
a1, contradicting our hypothesis. This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.13. PRIMES AND GEOMETRICAL SEQUENCES II.

Let 1, a1, a2, . . ., an be a geometrical progression. If a1 is prime, the only factors of
an (besides 1) are the preceding terms in the progression.

Proof. By [9.11] and the fact that 1, a1, a2, . . ., an is a geometrical progression, a1,
a2, ..., an-1 are factors of an. Suppose that a1 is prime and that an is divisible by b
where b does not equal a1, a2, ..., an-1.
By [9.12], if b is prime and a factor of an, then b is a factor of a1. Since a1 is prime,
a1 = b, contradicting our assumption that b = a1. Hence, b is a composite number.
By [7.31], since b is composite, b = mp where p is prime. Again by [9.12], p is a
factor of a1. But a1 is prime, and so a1 = p. It follows that an = (a1)n. Since an is
divisible by b = ma1, it follows that m = 1. But then b is not composite.
It follows that b = 1, and so the only factors of an (besides 1) are a1, a2, ..., an-1.

Proposition 9.14. UNIQUENESS OF PRIME FACTORING.

Let x = p1 · p2 · . . . · pn where each pi is a prime factor and p1  p2  ...  pn such
that x is the smallest number to have p1, p2, . . ., pn as factors. We claim that p1, p2,
. . ., pn are unique prime factors of x.

Proof. A proof by contradiction: suppose that x has a prime factor q such that q = pi
for 1  i  n. Let x = q · m.
9.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IX                                                371

Since x = p1 · p2 · . . . · pn, by [7.30] each prime p1, p2, . . ., pn much divide either q or
m; since q is prime and q = pi, we find that each p1, p2, . . ., pn divides m. Because
m is a factor of x, m < x. Hence, x is not the smallest number to have p1, p2, . . ., pn
as factors, contradicting our hypothesis.

Thus, p1, p2, . . ., pn are unique prime factors of x.

Proposition 9.15. RELATIVE PRIMES IN CONTINUED PROPORTIONS.

If a, b, and c are a continued proportion in lowest possible terms such that

                                    ab
                                      =

                                    bc

then:

1) c is relatively prime to a + b.

2) a is relatively prime to b + c.

3) b is relatively prime to a + c.

Proof. By [8.2], a = d2, b = de, and c = e2. Notice that a, c are relatively prime. It
follows that d, e are relatively prime.

By [7.28], d + e is relatively prime to both d and e. Since d + e and d are relatively
prime to e, by [7.24] d2+de is relatively prime to e. It follows that d2+de is relatively
prime to e2, or a + b is relatively prime to c (claim 1).

Similarly, b + c is relatively prime to a (claim 2).

Since d + e is relatively prime to both d and e, de is relatively prime to d + e [7.24].
By [7.25], (d + e)2 is relatively prime to de. It follows that d2 + 2de + e2 is relatively

prime to de; that is for natural numbers r, s where s = 1,

       d2 + 2de + e2                     =            r

                                    de                s

where r/s is not a natural number. Notice that de = s, and so
                                               d2 + e2 r
                                                  de = s - 2

Since r/s - 2 is not a natural number, d2 + e2 and de are relatively prime, or a + c is
relatively prime to b (claim 3).

Proposition 9.16. PRIMES AND GEOMETRICAL SEQUENCES III.
372                          CHAPTER 9. APPLIED NUMBER THEORY

If a and b are relatively prime natural numbers and in a continued proportion, then
the third proportional is not an integer.

Proof.  Suppose  a  =  b  where c is the third proportional to a and b, or
                 b     c

                                 c b2
                                   =

                                 1a

By [7.25], b2 and a are relatively prime; by [7.21],  b2  is in lowest terms.  If c is
                                                      a

a natural number, then    c  is also in lowest terms where a  =  1.  But a is a prime
                          1

number, so a = 1, a contradiction. Hence, c is not an integer, which completes the

proof.

Proposition 9.17. PRIMES AND GEOMETRICAL SEQUENCES IV.

Let 1, a1, a2, . . ., an be a geometrical progression. If a1 is relatively prime to an,
then the geometrical progression cannot be extended.

Proof. Suppose 1, a1, a2, . . ., an is a geometrical progression where a1 is relatively
prime to an. If the sequence can be extended, there is some natural number x is
such that

                             a1 = an
                             a2        x

                             a1 = a2
                             an        x

By [7.21], the LHS is reduced to lowest terms, and so a1 is a factor of a2. Since 1,
a1, a2, . . ., an is a geometrical progression, a1 is also a factor of an, contradicting our
hypothesis. This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.18. EXISTENCE OF A THIRD PROPORTIONAL WHICH IS AN
INTEGER.

Given two natural numbers a and b, we claim that the conditions under which a
and b have an integral third proportional are:

   (1) a is a factor of b2.
   (2) a is a factor of b.

Proof. Suppose a, b, and c are in continuous proportion:
                                                     ab
                                                        =
                                                     bc
9.2. PROPOSITIONS FROM BOOK IX                                                                         373

That is, ac = b2. It follows that a is a factor of b2.

If  a  and  b  are  relatively       prime,  then  by  [7.20],  a  is  reduced  to  lowest  terms,  and   by
                                                                b

[7.21], a is a factor of b, a contradiction. Hence, a is a factor of b. This completes the

proof.

Proposition 9.19. EXISTENCE OF A FOURTH PROPORTIONAL WHICH IS
AN INTEGER.

The Greek text of part of this proposition is hopelessly corrupt. However, the propo-
sition and proof are believed to be the following:
Given natural numbers a, b, c, and d, under what conditions can we write:

                                                     ac
                                                        =

                                                     bd

If this equality exists, then clearly d = abc . Or, if a divides bc, then d is a natural
number.

Proposition 9.20. INFINITE PRIMES.

Any finite list of prime numbers is incomplete.

Proof. Suppose we obtain a finite and complete list of prime numbers: p1, p2, . . ., pr
(where p1 < p2 < ... < pr). Let P = p1 · p2 · ... · pr + 1.

If P is prime, then our list is incomplete, a contradiction.

Hence P is composite and can be written P = qx where q is prime and x is a natural
number. It follows that

                    x = P = p1 · p2 · ... · pr + 1 = p1 · p2 · ... · pr + 1

Since our list of primes is complete, q = pi for some 1  i  r, and so

where m        =  p1 ·p2 ·...·pr  is a natural number.  Since x - m is a natural number,            q  =  1,
                         q

a contradiction since q is prime [Def. 7.9]. This completes the proof.

If each xi is even for 1  i  n, then xi is also even.

Proof. Suppose that each xi is even for 1  i  n. Then xi = 2ki for some positive

integer ki, and                              

                 xi = 2(ki) = 2 · ki

          
Hence, xi is also even. This completes the proof.

If each xi is odd for 1  i  n where n is even, then xi is even.

Proof. Suppose that each xi is odd for 1  i  n where n = 2t for some natural
number t. Then xi = 2ki + 1 for some positive integer ki, and

     x1 + x2 + ... + x2t-1 + x2t = (x1 + x2) + ... + (x2t-1 + x2t)

                       

                    =                        (xi + xi+1)

                       

                    =                        (2ki + 1 + 2ki+1 + 1)

                                                              
                                                     = 2 · (ki + ki+1 + 1)

          
Hence, xi is even. This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.23. ADDITION OF ODD NUMBERS II.
                                                                      

If each xi is odd for 1  i  n where n is odd, then xi is odd.

Proof. Suppose that each xi is odd for 1  i  n where n = 2t + 1 for some natural
number t. Then xi = 2ki + 1 for some positive integer ki, and

     x1 + x2 + ... + x2t + x2t+1 = (x1 + x2) + ... + (x2t-1 + x2t) + x2t+1

                    

                 =     (xi + xi+1) + x2t+1

                    

                 =     (2ki + 1 + 2ki+1 + 1) + 2k2t+1 + 1

                       (                                                    )

                 = 2·                        (ki + ki+1 + 1) + k2t+1 + 1

          
Hence, xi is odd. This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.24. SUBTRACTION OF EVEN NUMBERS.

If x < y where x and y are even, then y - x is also even.

Proof. Suppose that x < y where x and y are even. Then x = 2k1 and y = 2k2 where
k1 and k2 are natural numbers where k1 < k2. Then

                                  y - x = 2k2 - 2k1 = 2(k2 - k1) > 0

and so y - x is also even. This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.25. SUBTRACTION OF EVEN AND ODD NUMBERS I.
If x is even, y is odd, and y < x, then x - y is odd.

Proof. Our hypothesis and claim are written above. Since x is even, x = 2ki for
some positive integer ki. Since y is odd, y = 2kj + 1 for some positive integer kj.

Then

      x - y = (2ki) - (2kj + 1) = 2(kj - ki) - 1

By [Def. 7.5], x - y is odd. This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.26. SUBTRACTION OF ODD NUMBERS.
If x and y are odd and x < y, then y - x is even.

Proof. Suppose that x and y are odd and x < y. Then x = 2ki + 1 and y = 2kj + 1
where ki and kj are natural numbers. Then

                             y - x = (2kj + 1) - (2ki + 1) = 2(kj - ki)

Hence, y - x is even. This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.27. SUBTRACTION OF EVEN AND ODD NUMBERS II.
Suppose that x is even, y is odd, and x < y. Then y - x is odd.
376   CHAPTER 9. APPLIED NUMBER THEORY

Proof. Suppose that x is even, y is odd, and x < y. Since x is even, x = 2ki for some
positive integer ki. Since y is odd, y = 2kj + 1 for some positive integer kj.

Then

      y - x = (2kj + 1) - (2ki) = 2(kj - ki) + 1

Hence, y - x is odd. This completes the proof.

Proposition 9.28. MULTIPLICATION OF ODD AND EVEN NUMBERS.
If x is even and y is odd, then xy is even.
Proof. Suppose that x is even and y is odd. Then x = 2ki and y = 2kj + 1 for some
natural numbers ki and kj. Then

                      xy = 2ki · (2kj + 1) = 4ki · kj + 2ki = 2(2ki · kj + ki)

Hence, xy is even. This completes the proof.

Corollary. 9.28.1. If xy is even, then either x and y are even or x is even and y is
odd.

Proposition 9.29. MULTIPLICATION OF ODD NUMBERS.

If x and y are odd, then xy is odd.

Proof. Suppose that x and y are odd. Then x = 2ki + 1 and y = 2kj + 1 for natural
numbers ki and kj. Then

                                     xy = (2k1 + 1)(2kj + 1)
                                           = 4kikj + 2k1 + 2kj + 1
                                           = 2(2kikj + k1 + kj) + 1

Hence, xy is odd. This completes the proof.

Corollary. 9.29.1. If xy is odd, then x and y are odd. That is, xy is odd iff x and y
are odd.

Proposition 9.30. ODD FACTORS OF EVEN NUMBERS.

If x is odd, y is even, and x is a factor of y, then x is also a factor of 2y .

Proof. Suppose y = 2mx where x = 2k + 1. By [10.21] or [10.28], y = 2m(2k + 1)
is even and x is clearly a factor y. Equally clearly, we see that x is a factor of
y/2 = m(2k + 1).

Proposition 9.31. ODD RELATIVE PRIMES.
If x is odd and relatively prime to y, then x is also relatively prime to 2y.
Proof. Suppose x = 2k + 1 and x  y. If x| (2y), then x is even, a contradiction.

Corollary. 9.31.1 If x is odd and relatively prime to y, then x is also relatively prime
to 2ky where k  1 is a natural number.

Proposition 9.32. MULTIPLES OF 2.

If y = 2k for some natural number k, and if y = s · t for natural numbers s > 1 and
t > 1, then s and t are even numbers.

Proof. Notice that

                                           2k = st
                                            t = 2k/s

Since t is a natural number and s > 1, it follows that s = 2k-m where m is a natural
number such that m < k [9.11]. It also follows that t = 2m. Thus both s and t are
even numbers, which proves our claim.

Proposition 9.33. WHEN HALF OF A NUMBER IS ODD.

If x is a natural number such that x/2 is odd, then x is the product of an even
number times an odd number and not the product of an even number times an
even number.

Proof.  Suppose  x  =   2k + 1.  Then   x  =  2(2k + 1),    and  even  times  an  odd.  Suppose
                 2

x  =  2m  where  m  is  even.  Then  x  =  m  is  even,  a  contradiction.

Proposition 9.34. SPECIAL EVEN NUMBERS.

Let  x  be  an  even  number   which       is  not    a  power  of  2  and  where    x   is   not  an  odd  factor.
                                                                                     2

Then x may be factored into two even numbers as well as into an even number and

an odd number.

Proof.  Let    x  =  2m  such  that     x  =   2k  and   x  =   2n  for    some  k,  m,  and     n.  Notice  that
                                                         2

x = 4n = 2 · 2n, and so x can be factored into two even numbers.

Since   x   =  2k ,  there  exists  some   t       1  where    x   =   2r  + 1.  That    is,  x  =   (2t) (2r + 1),
                                                               2t

which completes the proof.

Proposition 9.35. CONTINUED PROPORTIONS XVI.

If a1 = 1 and                       a1 : a2 = a2 : a3 = ... = an : an+1
then                        (a2-a1) : a1 = (an+1-a1) : (a1 + a2 + ... + an)

Proof. Notice2 that

                                           a1 = a2  a3 = a2
                                           a2 a3 a2 a1

In fact, for 2  i  n we have                     ai+1 = ai

                                                   ai       ai-1

Applying [7.11], we also have

                            ai+1 - ai = ai  ai+1 - ai = ai - ai-1
                            ai - ai-1 ai-1                   ai             ai-1

This gives us               an+1 - an = an - an-1 = . . . = a2 - a1

                                    an                an-1                  a1

By a finite number of applications of [7.12], we obtain

                      an+1 - an + an - an-1 + . . . + a2 - a1 = a2 - a1
                               an + an-1 + . . . + a2 + a1                           a1

This simplifies to                         an+1 - a1                = a2 - a1

                               an + an-1 + . . . + a2 + a1                  a1

which completes the proof.

Example. 9.35.1. Consider the continued proportion 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. Since there
are five terms, n = 4, and [9.35] states that

4-2 =  32 - 2                              1 30
                                      =
2 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 1 30

Corollary. 9.35.1 The ratio above can be written in another form. Let an+1 = arn,
a1 = a, a2 = ar, and an + an-1 + . . . + a2 + a1 = Sn, and we obtain

       arn - a ar - a
                                =
       Sn                          a

or a(rn - 1)
                                               Sn = r - 1

Proposition 9.36. PERFECT NUMBERS.

If 2k -1 is a prime number, then 2k-1(2k -1) is a perfect number. Every even perfect
number has this form.

Proof. Suppose3 that p = 2k - 1 is a prime number, and let

                                            n = 2k-1 · p
                                                 = 2k-1(2k - 1)

We claim that n is a perfect number and that every even perfect number has this
form.
To prove our claim, we use the sigma function to show that (n) = 2n [Def. 9.1].
Since the sigma function is multiplicative, and since (p) = p + 1 = 2k, we find that

                                         (n) = (2k-1 · p)
                                                  = (2k-1) · (p)
                                                       ( 2k - 1 k )
                                                  = 2-1 ·2

                                                  = (2k - 1) · 2k
                                                  = 2n

Hence, n is a perfect number.
Now suppose that n is an even perfect number where n = 2k-1m such that m is an
odd integer and k  2. We wish to show that m = 2k - 1.

    3This proof is based on Chris K. Caldwell's proof:
  http://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/EvenPerfect.html
380                            CHAPTER 9. APPLIED NUMBER THEORY
Notice that
                     (n) = (2k-1m)
                              = (2k-1) · (m)
                              = (2k - 1) · (m)

Since n is perfect,

                     (n) = 2n
                              = 2km

Hence

                     2km = (2k - 1) · (m)

Since (m) is a natural number,

                                                      2k m
                                                     2k - 1

is also a natural number. Since 2k - 1 is a prime number greater than 2, we must
have that 2k - 1 is a factor of m. Let m = (2k - 1)q. Then

                                    2k(2k - 1)q = (2k - 1) · (m)
                                              2kq = (m)

Recall that the sigma function adds all positive factors of a natural number. Then
since m and q are both positive factors of m, it follows that (m)  m + q. But

                                          2kq = (m)
                                                   m+q
                                                  = (2k - 1)q + q
                                                  = 2kq - q + q
                                                  = 2kq

Hence, (m) = m + q. Since m is one of its own divisors, m is prime. Since m is
prime, (m) = m + 1; or, q = 1. Since

                                        (m) = 2kq = 2k = m + 1

we find that m = 2k - 1.
Thus, n = 2k-1m = 2k-1(2k - 1), which completes the proof.

Irrational Numbers

In this chapter, all variables a, b, c, etc., are assumed to be positive real numbers
unless otherwise stated.

10.1 Definitions

0. The Whole Numbers are the set of numbers containing 0, 1, 2, 3, ... . The Natural

Numbers (the positive integers) are a subset of the Whole numbers, containing 1, 2,

3,  ...  .  Rational    Numbers   are  the    set  of  numbers  that       can  be  written     p  where     both
                                                                                                q

p and q are whole numbers where q = 0. (Notice that the rational numbers include

the whole numbers.) The Real Numbers consist of the rational numbers and the

irrational numbers. We do not require the use of negative numbers.

1.  That    a  is  a  rational  number    is  a  necessary  and   sufficient        condition      for  the  exis-
            b

tence of natural numbers m and n and some real number c such that a = mc and

b  =  nc.1  Numbers     which     cannot  be  expressed    in  the   form  a    are  irrational    numbers.
                                                                           b

                                                                                       
If ab is rational, then ab is rationally expressible. (Notice that ab may either be

rational or irrational.) In the case of a = b, we have: if a2 is rational, then a is

rationally expressible.

2.  x1   and   x2  are  said  to  be  commensurable    if  x1  =  a  ·  c  and  x2  =  d  ·  c  where   a, b, d, e
                                                                  b                    e

are natural numbers and c is either an irrational number or 1. Otherwise a and b

are incommensurable.

3. A medial number x = p · k1/4 is a number where p is rationally expressible, x4 is
rational, and x, x2 are irrational. They are proven to exist in [10.21].

    · 21/4 is a medial number since (21/4)4 = 2 is rational, while 21/4 and 2 are
       irrational.

· 2 · 3 is a medial number since it is irrational, 2 · 3 is irrational, and 12 is

     rational.

·    3 · 71/4                                                              
               is a medial number since it is irrational, 9 · 7 is irrational, and 567 is

     rational.

If x is a medial number, then x2 = p2 · k is a second medial number.

·    Since 31/4                              
                 is a medial number, 3 is a second medial number.

                        
· Since 3 7 is a medial number, 3 7 is a second medial number.

·    Since 5 · 31/4                                  
                     is a medial number, 25· 3 is a second medial number.

4. A first bimedial number a + b is defined where a and b are medial, a and b are
incommensurable, a2 and b2 are commensurable, and ab is rational.

An alternate definition of a first bimedial number is a + b where a = p · k1/4 and
                          4                        
b = p · k3/4 where p is rationally expressible and k and k are irrational numbers.

The terms of a first bimedial number are a and b.

5. A second bimedial number a + b is defined where a and b are medial, a and b are
incommensurable, a2 and b2 are commensurable, and ab is a second medial number.

An alternate definition of a second bimedial number is a + b where a = p · k1/4 and
b = p · 1/2 · k-1/4 where p is rationally expressible and both k,  are rationally
expressible.

The terms of a second bimedial number are a and b.

6. Let a > b be rationally expressible such that a and b are incommensurable but
a2 and b2 are commensurable. We define n = a + b as a binomial number.

Remark. Binomial numbers, like apotome numbers, are roots of the equation
                              x4 - 2 · (1 + k) · p2 · x3 + (1 - k)2 · p4 = 0

7. We define a major number n = a + b where a and b are incommensurable, a2 and
b2 are incommensurable, a2 + b2 is rational, and ab is a second medial number.

Alternatively, we may define a major number n = a + b where p is rationally ex-

8. We define a + b as the root of the sum of two second medial numbers (or a RSSM
number) when a and b are incommensurable, a2 and b2 are incommensurable, a2+b2
and ab are each a second medial numbers, and ab is incommensurable with a2 + b2.

    and  are irrational but  is rational.

[10.41] proves that the root of a RSSM number is irrational.

9. Let a and b exist where a2 and b2 are incommensurable, a2 + b2 is a second medial
number, and ab is rational. Then n = a + b is defined as the root of a rational plus a
second medial number (or a RPSM number).

Alternatively, we may define a + b as

10.2 Book X, Propositions 1-47

Proposition 10.1. THE ARCHIMEDEAN PROPERTY.

Let x and y be real numbers. If 0 < x < y, then there exists some natural number
n such that n · x > y.

Proof. Suppose instead that there does not exist a natural number n such that
n · x > y; equivalently, suppose that for any natural number n we obtain n  xy .

Since  y  <  ,  it follows  that  there exists  a    largest natural   number  n    such that
       x

n  n; otherwise, there would exist some n + k such that n + k > y. But by [9.20],

there exists a prime number p such that n < p. Since p is a natural number, we

obtain a contradiction.

Hence,  no  largest  n  exists,  contradicting  our  hypothesis  that  n    y  for  all  n.  Thus,
                                                                            x

there exists some natural number n such that n · x > y.

Remark. Although this property is named for Archimedes, Archimedes attributed
the property to Eudoxus of Cnidus.

Proposition 10.2. THE MODIFIED EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE
IF TWO NUMBERS ARE INCOMMENSURABLE.

Let x1 > x2 be positive real numbers. There exists some positive integer n such
that

                                               x1 - n · x2 > 0
and

                                            x1 - (n + 1) · x2 < 0
We begin the algorithm with x1 - n1 · x2 = x3 where n1 is chosen as above and
continue:

                                            x1 - n1 · x2 = x3
                                            x2 - n2 · x3 = x4

                                                              ...
                                        xk - nk · xk+1 = xk+2

                                                              ...

If xi+1 does not divide xi for i = 3, 4, ... no matter how many times the algorithm is
repeated, then x1 and x2 are incommensurable.
10.2. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 1-47                                                                       387

Proof. Let x1 > x2 be real numbers we input into Euclid's Algorithm, and consider
the contrapositive statement of the above: if x1 and x2 are commensurable, then
after k <  repetitions of the algorithm, xk+2 and xk+1 will share a common factor.

We shall use a proof by contradiction on the contrapositive argument: suppose x1
and x2 are commensurable and that xi+1 does not divide xi for i = 3, 4, ... no matter
how many times the algorithm is repeated.

Since x1 and x2 are commensurable, then either x1 and x2 are natural numbers or
they are not. If they are, we continue.

By [7.1], x1 > x2 > x3 > ... > xk+2 > ... where each xi is a natural number. If
set S is the set of all xi, by [Lemma 7.30.0], S contains a minimum element. This
contradicts our hypothesis that the algorithm may be repeated indefinitely.

If  x1  and  x2  are  not  natural  numbers,   then    x1  =  a  ·c    and  x2  =  d  ·c  where  a, b, d, e
                                                              b                    e

are natural numbers and c is either an irrational number or 1. Let f = the least

common multiple of b and e; g = the multiplicative inverse of c; and let x1 = x1 · f g,

x2 = x2 · f g. It follows that x1, x2 are natural numbers. Following the argument

above, we reach the same contradiction.

This completes the proof.

Remark. See also [7.1].

Example. [10.2.1] Let x1 =  and x2 = 3, and so x1 > x2. If xi+1 does not divide
xi for i = 3, 4, ... no matter how many times the algorithm is repeated, by [10.2], 
and 3 are incommensurable (which they are).

Example.     [10.2.2] Let x1  =     5  · 21/3  and x2  =   3  · 21/3.  Then x1     > x2   and x1, x2  are
                                    7                      5

commensurable. Using the proof of [10.2], x1 = 25 and x2 = 21, and after k < 

repetitions of the Euclidean Algorithm, xk+2 and xk+1 will share a common factor.

(In fact, k = 2. Details are left as an exercise to the reader.)

Proposition 10.3. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR OF TWO COMMEN-
SURABLE NUMBERS.

Let x1 and x2 be commensurable real numbers. There exists a greatest common
factor of x1 and x2 which is greater than 1.

Proof. The proof follows that of [7.2], mutatis mutandis.

Corollary. 10.3.1. If k divides both x1 and x2, then k also divides the GCF of x1,
x2.

Proposition 10.4. THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR OF THREE COMMEN-
SURABLE NUMBERS.

Let x1, x2, and x3 be commensurable real numbers. There exists a greatest common
factor of x1, x2, and x3 which is greater than 1.

Proof. The proof follows that of [7.3], mutatis mutandis.

Corollary. 10.4.1. If k divides both x1, x2, and x3, then k also divides the GCF of
x1, x2, and x3.

Proposition 10.5. COMMENSURABILITY & RATIONAL NUMBERS I.

If  x1  and    x2  are      commensurable,            then      x1  =      q   where   q   is  a  rational  number.
                                                                x2

Proof.     Suppose x1 and x2 are commensurable.                                   It follows that x1  =     a  ·  c  and  x2   =  de ·c
                                                                                                            b

where a, b, d, e are natural numbers and c is either an irrational number or 1. Then

                                                      x1 = a · e · c = ae
                                                      x2 b d c bd

Let q = bd ae , and the proof is complete.

Proposition 10.6. COMMENSURABILITY & RATIONAL NUMBERS II.

If  x1  =   q  where        q   is  a  rational       number,   then       x1     and  x2   are   commensurable.
    x2

Proof.     Suppose          x1     =q     where q     is a rational number.               Then x1  = x2 · q.         If x2  =  d  ·c,
                            x2                                                                                                 e

then    x1  =  q   ·  d  ·  c.  If  q  ·  d  =  ab ,  then  x1  =   a   ·  c,  which   completes   the      proof.
                      e                   e                         b

Corollary. [10.6.1] By [10.5] and [10.6], x1 and x2 are commensurable if and only

if  x1  =   q  where        q  is   rational.
    x2

Proposition 10.7. INCOMMENSURABILITY & IRRATIONAL NUMBERS I.

If  x1  and    x2  are      incommensurable,                then    x1     =   q  for  any  rational  q.
                                                                    x2

Proof. This is the contrapositive statement of [10.6]
10.2. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 1-47                                                                                  389

Proposition 10.8. INCOMMENSURABILITY & IRRATIONAL NUMBERS II.

If  x1  =  q   for  any     rational     q,  then  x1  and  x2     are  incommensurable.
    x2

Proof. This is the contrapositive statement of [10.5]

Proposition 10.9. COMMENSURABILITY OF SQUARES.

1) a and b are commensurable iff there exists natural numbers c and d such that
( a )2 ( c )2

 b =d .
2) a and b are incommensurable iff there does not exist natural numbers c and d

                            ( a )2 ( c )2
such that such that b = d .

Proof.     1)  Suppose      a    and  b  are  commensurable.             By    [Cor.  10.6.1],  a   =  q  where  q  is
                                                                         ( a )2 ( c )2          b

rational.      If  q  =  c  for  natural     numbers   c, d,       then     b  =d .
                         d

Suppose b ( a )2 = d ( c )2. Then ba = q where q = dc . By [Cor. 10.6.1], a and b are

commensurable.

2) This statement is the contrapositive of statement 1, which completes the proof.

Remark. If a is commensurable with b, then a2 is commensurable with b2. How-
ever, if a2 is commensurable with b2, it does not necessarily follow that a and b are
commensurable (e.g., 4 is commensurable with 2, but 2 is incommensurable with


  2).

Corollary. 10.9.1. Two numbers have a ratio which a square number has to a
square number iff they are similar plane numbers. (And numbers which are not
similar plane numbers do not have a ratio which a square number has to a square
number.)

Lemma.         10.10.0 If        a  and  c   are rational, then         ac  is also rational.

Proof.     Since      a  and   c    are  rational,     a, b, c, d  are  natural  numbers.       It  follows  that   ab
                      b        d

and bd are also natural numbers, completing the proof.

Lemma.         10.10.1 If        a  is rational and    c    is irrational, then       ac  is irrational.

Proof.  Suppose        a  is rational,  c  is irrational, and      ac  is rational.      Since  c  is irrational,
                       b                d                          bd                           d

either c or d is irrational.        Wlog,     let c be irrational.       If  ac    is rational,    then    ac  =  x
                                                                             bd                            bd     y

where x and y are natural numbers.                    Since c =    xbd   where a, b, d, x, y are natural
                                                                   ay

numbers,   c   is   rational,  a    contradiction.    Thus,    ac  is  irrational.

Proposition 10.10. CONSTRUCTION OF INCOMMENSURABLE NUMBERS.

We wish to find real numbers a, b, c such that a, b are incommensurable, a2, b2 are
commensurable, and both a, c and a2, c2 are incommensurable.

Proof. Let

                                                  a2       m
                                                  b2 = n

                                          
where m, n are natural and m/n is irrational. By [Cor. 10.6.1], a and b are
incommensurable while a2 and b2 are commensurable.

Choose real number x such that x and x2 are irrational. Since m is a natural

number,    by  [Lemma          10.10.1],   m  is  irrational.  By  [Cor.     10.6.1],    x  and    m  are  incom-
                                           x

                                                      cx

By [10.11], a and c are incommensurable. Since x2 is irrational, a2 and c2 are
incommensurable. This completes the proof.

Proposition 10.11. COMMENSURABILITY OF FRACTIONS.

Given   a  =  xy ,  a  and  b  are  commensurable     if  and      only  if  x  and   y  are  commensurable.

Proof. Suppose that a and b are commensurable. Then

Proposition 10.12. TRANSITIVITY OF COMMENSURABLE NUMBERS.

If a and b are commensurable and b and c are commensurable, then a and c are
commensurable.

Proof. Notice that a = bq and b = cr where q, r are rational. Then a = rq · c and

a   =  rq.   By    [Lemma      10.10.0],   a  and  c  are  commensurable.

Proposition 10.13. COMMENSURABLE & INCOMMENSURABLE NUMBERS.

If a is commensurable with b but b is incommensurable with c, then a is incommen-
surable with c.

Proof. Notice that a = bq where q is rational and that b = cx where x is irrational.

Then      a  =  qx · c   and   a  =   qx.  By   [Lemma     10.10.1],    the   RHS  is  irrational,  and  so  a
                               c

and c are incommensurable.

Proposition 10.14. COMMENSURABILITY OF SQUARES.

Let    a  =  cd .  If             is  commensurable           with  a,  then             is  commensurable
       b                 a2 - b2                                                c2 - d2

with c.

Proof.    Let      a  =  cd .  It follows that
                   b
                                                      a2 c2
                                                      b2 = d2

By [5.17],

                                              a2 - b2      =  c2 - d2

                                                b2                  d2

And since                                     a2 c2           b2 d2

                                              b2 = d2  a2 = c2

we have

                                      a2 - b2 b2              c2 - d2 d2
                                           b2 · a2 = d2 · c2

                                              a2 - b2      =  c2 - d2

                                                a2                  c2

                                                              
                                              a2 - b2 = c2 - d2

If a2 - b2 is commensurable with a, by [10.11] c2 - d2 is commensurable with

c.

Corollary. 10.14.1. Suppose x > y. Then x2 > y2, and there exists a real number z
such that x2 - y2 = z2, or x2 = y2 + z2.

Lemma. 10.15.0 If a and b are rational, then a + b is rational.

Proof. Suppose a and b are rational.            Then a =  c  and  b  =  e  where c, d, e, f are
                                                          d             f

natural numbers. It follows that a + b = df cf+ed , and so a + b is rational.

Proposition 10.15. COMMENSURABILITY OF THE SUM OF COMMENSU-
RABLE NUMBERS.

(1) If x1 and x2 are commensurable, then x1 ± x2 is commensurable with x1 and
with x2.

(2) If x1 ± x2 is commensurable with either x1 or x2, then x1 and x2 are commensu-
rable.

Proof. (1) Since x1 and x2 are commensurable, x1 = x2 · q where q is rational. Then
x1 + x2 = x2 · (1 + q), and

                                       x1 + x2 = 1 + q
                                          x2

                                       x1 + x2 = q + 1
                                       x1            q

Since each RHS is rational, x1 +x2 is commensurable with both x1 and x2. A similar
proof follows for x1 - x2.

(2) Wlog, suppose x1 + x2 = qx1 where q is rational. Then x2 = x1 · (q - 1), and so

x2  =  q-1  is  rational.  Hence,  x1  and  x2  are  commensurable.  A  similar  proof  follows
x1

for x1 - x2.

Remark. [10.15] cannot be rewritten as an "if and only if " statement without losing
part of the result.

Proposition 10.16. INCOMMENSURABILITY OF THE SUM OF INCOMMEN-
SURABLE MAGNITUDES.

(1) If x1 and x2 are incommensurable, then x1 ± x2 is incommensurable with both
x1 and x2.
(2) If a ± b is incommensurable with either x1 or x2, then x1 is incommensurable
with x2.

Proof. Statement (1) is the contrapositive statement of [10.15] (2).
Statement (2) is the contrapositive statement of [10.15] (1).

Proposition 10.17. CONDITION FOR COMMENSURABILITY OF ROOTS OF
THE QUADRATIC EQUATION.2

Let  x2  =  bx -  a2  where  a  <  b.  The  following  three  statements  are  equivalent:
                  4

1. x is commensurable with b
                                       

2. b is commensurable with b2 - a2

3. b is commensurable with h where b2 = a2 + h2

Proof. Notice that

                                               x2 = bx - a2
                                                                  4

                                       x2 - bx = - a2
                                                            4

                                   ( b )2         b2 - a2
                                   x- 2 = 4

                                                       
                                       x - b = ± b2 - a2
                                            2            2

                                                           
                                            x = b ± b2 - a2

                                                              2

                                                         
                                            x = b ± b2 - a2
                                            b            2b

(where we are only interested in positive values of x). If x is commensurable with
                              

b, then by [10.11], b ± b2 - a2 is commensurable with 2b. That is,
                                                   

                                              b ± b2 - a2 = q
                                                     2b

where q is rational. But this is equivalent to
                                           
                                             b2 - a2 = 2q  1
                                                b

    2The formulation of this proposition and the outline of its proof comes from David E. Joyce's edition
of Euclid's Elements: http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookX/propX17.html.

By [Lemma 10.15.0], 2q  1 is a rational number, and so b2 - a2 is commensurable

with b.

                                                                             
Suppose b2 - a2 is commensurable with b and let h = b2 - a2. Then h is com-

mensurable with b where b2 = a2 + h2.

Finally,  suppose     h  is  commensurable      with  b  where     b2  =  a2  +  h2.  Since  h  =        -  a2,
              2 2                                                                                    b2
                                                                                b2 -a2
we find that b - a is also commensurable with 2b, or 2b = r where r is a

rational number.

By the above,                                   

                                        x = b ± b2 - a2 = 1 ± r
                                        b       2b              2

By  [Lemma    10.15.0],      1  ±r  is  a  rational  number,  and  so     x  and  b  are  commensurable.
                             2

This completes the proof.

Proposition 10.18. CONDITION FOR INCOMMENSURABILITY OF ROOTS
OF THE QUADRATIC EQUATION.

Let  x2  =  bx -  a2  where     a  <  b.  Then  the  following  three     statements      are   equivalent:
                  4

1. x is incommensurable with b
                                          

2. b is incommensurable with b2 - a2

3. b is incommensurable with h where b2 = a2 + h2

Proof. This is the contrapositive statement to [10.17] and so follows immediately.

Proposition 10.19. THE PRODUCT OF COMMENSURABLE RATIONALLY EX-
PRESSIBLE NUMBERS.
If x1 and x2 are rationally expressible and commensurable, then x1 · x2 is rational.
Proof. Since x1 and x2 are commensurable, x1 = q · x2 where q is rational. Then

                                             x1 · x2 = q · x22

Since x2 is rationally expressible, by [Lemma 10.10.0] x1 · x2 is rational.
10.2. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 1-47                                                              395

Proposition 10.20. THE QUOTIENT OF COMMENSURABLE RATIONALLY
EXPRESSIBLE NUMBERS.

If x1 is rationally expressible and x1 · x2 is rational, then x2 is rationally expressible
and commensurable with x1.

Proof. Notice that x1 · x2 = q where q is rational. Hence, x1 = x2 q . Since x1 is
rationally expressible and q is rational, x2 is rationally expressible.

Also notice that                               x1 = 2 q
                                               x2 x2

Since x2 is rationally expressible, the RHS is rational. Thus, x1 and x2 are com-
mensurable. This completes the proof.

Lemma. 10.21.0 The square root of an irrational number is irrational.

Proof. Suppose q is irrational and q is rational. Then there exists natural num-

bers a and b such that                         q = a
                                                       b

But then b2 a2 = q, and q is rational, a contradiction. Therefore q is irrational.

Proposition 10.21. EXISTENCE OF MEDIAL NUMBERS.

Suppose p and p · k are rationally expressible and incommensurable but p2 and
p2k are commensurable. Then p · k1/4 is a medial number and p2 · k is a second
medial number.

Proof. Notice that

                                            p       a
                                               =
                                            a       p· k

                                            a2 = p2 · k
                                             a = p · k1/4

We  claim  that  p  ·  k1/4  is  a  medial  number  and   p2  ·       is  a  second  medial  number.
                                                                   k

                    
Since p and p · k are incommensurable and

                                            p             p2
                                               =

396                                            CHAPTER 10. IRRATIONAL NUMBERS

by  [10.11]  p2   and  p2  ·       are  also  incommensurable.        Since  p2  is  rational,  it  follows
                                k
               k
that  p2  ·       is  irrational;  by  [Lemma  10.21.0],  p  ·  k1/4  is  also  irrational.

Since p and p · k are rationally expressible, p2 and p2k are rational. By [Lemma

10.10.0], p4k is also rational. By [Def. 10.3], p · k1/4 is a medial number.
Also by [Def. 10.3], (p · k1/4)2 = p2 · k is a second medial number, which completes

the proof.

Proposition 10.22. FACTORS OF THE SQUARE OF A MEDIAL NUMBER.

Let a be a medial number and b be rationally expressible. Then c = ba2 is rationally
expressible and incommensurable to b.

Proof. Suppose a = p · k1/4 is a medial number and b is rationally expressible. Then
                                                 2 a4 p4k
                                               c = 2= 2
                                                       bb

Since c2 is rational, c is rationally expressible. Since
                                               c p2 · k
                                               b = b2

where b2 p2 is rational [Def. 10.3] and k is irrational by hypothesis, by applying
[Lemma 10.10.1], we find that b and c are incommensurable.

Proposition 10.23. A NUMBER COMMENSURABLE WITH A MEDIAL NUM-
BER IS MEDIAL.

If a and b are commensurable where b is a medial number, then a is a medial num-
ber.

Proof. Suppose a and b = p · k1/4 are commensurable. Then
                                                      a

                                                  p · k1/4 = q
where q is rational. It follows that a = q · p · k1/4. Since q is rational and p is
rationally expressible, it follows that qp is rationally expressible. By [Def. 10.3], a

Corollary. 10.23.1 If a and b are commensurable where b is a second medial num-
ber, then a is a second medial number.

Proof. Suppose a and b = p2 · k are commensurable. Then

                                                      a

                                                  p2 · k

where q is rational. It follows that a = q · p2 · k. Since q and p2 are rational, by
[Lemma 10.10.0], qp2 is also rational. By [Def. 10.3], a is a second medial number.

Proposition 10.24. PRODUCT OF COMMENSURABLE MEDIAL NUMBERS I.

If a and b are medial numbers where a is commensurable with b, then ab is a second
medial number.

Proof. Notice that a = bq where q is rational. Then ab = q · b2. Since b is medial,
b = p · k1/4 where p is rationally expressible and where k1/4, k are irrational but k
is rational. Then ab = qp2 · k.
Since q, p2 are rational, qp2 are rational [Lemma 10.10.0]. By [Def. 10.3], ab is a
second medial number.

Proposition 10.25. PRODUCT OF COMMENSURABLE MEDIAL NUMBERS II.

If a and b are medial numbers where a2 and b2 are commensurable but a and b are
incommensurable, then (ab)2 is rational.

Proof.  Let  a  =  pk1/4  and  b  =  pk1/4m  where       is  irrational  but  m  is  a  rational.
                                                      m

Then a, b are medial such that a2, b2 are commensurable but a, b are incommensu-
rable. Notice that (ab)2 = p4km is rational by [Lemma 10.10.0]. This completes the

proof.

Proposition 10.26. DIFFERENCES OF MEDIAL NUMBERS.

If a and b are second medial numbers where a > b, then a - b is irrational.

Proof. Suppose a = p2 · k and b = q2 · m are second medial numbers such that
a > b. We claim that a - b is irrational.3

    3The formulation of this proposition and the outline of its proof comes from David E. Joyce's edition
of Euclid's Elements:

If a - b is rational, then (a - b)2 is also rational. Furthermore,

                                  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
                                               = p4k - 2p2q2 · km + q4m
                                               =r

where r is rational. Or,                1 · (p4k + q4m - r) = ab
                                        2

Since the LHS is rational, ab is rational; that is, ab = t for some rational t. It follows

that   a  =  b2t .  Since  b  is  a  second  medial  number,  b2   is  rational,  and   so  a  is  rational.
       b                                                                                    b

Notice that (a - b) = b · b ( a - 1). Then a - b is rational while b · b ( a - 1) is irrational

by [Lemma 10.10.1], a contradiction. Thus, a - b is irrational.

Lemma.       10.27.0 If x is irrational,        1  is irrational.
                                                x

Proof.    Suppose that x is irrational but           1  is rational.   Then       1  =  r   where r, s are
                                                     x                            x     s

natural numbers. It follows that x = sr , and so x is rational, a contradiction. Thus,

1  is  irrational.

Proposition 10.27. COMPONENTS OF A FIRST BIMEDIAL NUMBER.

We wish to construct medial numbers a and b such that a and b are incommensu-
rable, a2 and b2 are commensurable, and ab is rational. ([Def. 10.4 defines a + b as
a first bimedial number.)

Proof. Using [10.21], construct medial number a = p · k1/4. Notice that

                                             p          p · k1/4
                                             =
                                             p· k       b

                                                   b = p · k3/4

We claim that a and b are the required numbers. Notice that b2 = p2k ·k. Since p2k
is rational and k is irrational by hypothesis, b2 is irrational by [Lemma 10.10.1].

By [Lemma 10.21.0], b is irrational. Since b4 = p4 · k3 is rational, b is medial.

Also notice that    a      =      1  .             is irrational by hypothesis, applying [Lemma
                    b             k     Since k

10.27.0], we find that a and b are incommensurable. Since k is rational by hypoth-

esis, a2 and b2 are commensurable.

Also notice that ab = p2k. Since p is rationally expressible [10.21], ab is rational,
which completes the construction.
10.2. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 1-47                                               399

Lemma. 10.28.0 Let q be a rational number. q is rational if and only if q = s2 r2 for
natural numbers r, s.

Proof. Suppose q is rational. Then q = sr for natural numbers r, s and so q = s2 r2 .
Suppose q = s2 r2 . Then q = sr , and so q is rational.

Remark. In the proof of [Lemma 10.28.0], let s = 1. Then for all natural numbers
n: n is a natural number if and only of n = k2 for some natural number k.

Proposition 10.28. COMPONENTS OF A SECOND BIMEDIAL NUMBER.

We wish to find medial numbers a and b such that a and b are incommensurable, a2
and b2 are commensurable, and ab is a second medial number. ([Def. 10.5 defines
a + b as a second bimedial number.)

Proof. Suppose p, p·k, and p·m are rationally expressible and incommensurable
such that mk = s2 r2 for any natural numbers r, s. Let

                                  p              a
                                        =
                                  a          p· k

                                  a = p · k1/4

and

                                                 p · k1/4
                           p· k
                                  =
                           p· m                        b

                                                     
                                                  p· m
                                        b = k1/4

We claim that a and b are the required numbers. By [10.21], a, b are medial.

Notice that                             a2 p2k
                                        b2 = p2m

and so a2, b2 are commensurable.  Since      k   =     r2  for any natural numbers r, s, by
                                             m         s2

[Lemma 10.28.0],    k  is  irrational,  and  so  a, b  are  incommensurable.
                    m

Finally, notice that ab = p2 · m, and so ab is a second medial number. This com-

pletes the construction.

Lemma. 10.29.0 We wish to find two square numbers such that their sum is square.
Take similar planes numbers mnp2 and mnq2 which are either both even or both odd
(so their difference is divisible by 2). We claim that

                         2 ( mnp2 - mnq2 )2 ( mnp2 + mnq2 )2
            (mnpq) +                             =
                                    2                  2

so that the sum and the difference of mnpq and 12 (mnp2 - mnq2) are each square
numbers.

Corollary. The above Lemma provides a way to generate Pythagorean Triples: if n
and m are natural numbers and m < n, then Pythagorean Triples follow the ratio

                                    n2 - m2 n2 + m2
                              mn :           :
                                          2         2

Example. If n = 3 and m = 1, we have the triple 3 : 4 : 5. If n = 30 and m = 10, we
have the triple 300 : 400 : 500 (a multiple of the triple 3 : 4 : 5).

Lemma. 10.29.1 We wish to find two square numbers such that their sum is not
square. (Recall that [Lemma 10.29.0] states that there exist natural numbers a, b, c
such that a2 + b2 = c2 and how to construct them.) Suppose we have

            2 2 ( mp2 - mq2 )2 ( mp2 + mq2 )2
            mp · mq + 2                          =
                                                             2

where mp2 and mpq2 are both odd or even. Using a proof by contradiction, it can be

shown that                    2 2 ( mp2 - mq2 )2

                         mp · mq +               2 -1

is not a square number.

                              (2       2     )2                 (2  2  )2
Consequently, if mp2 · mq2 > mp -mq 2 - 1 , then mp2 · mq2 - mp -mq 2 - 1 is a

positive, non-square number.

Proposition 10.29. CONSTRUCTION I.

We wish to construct rationally expressible numbers a and b such that a and b are
incommensurable, a2 and b2 are commensurable, and a2 = b2 + f 2 where a and f
are commensurable.

Proof. Let p be rationally expressible and choose natural numbers m > n such that
m2 - n2 is not a square number. Let

                                          m2                p2
                                    m2 - n2 = b2

                                                            p2 (m2 - n2)
                                                 b2 = m2

                                                              
                                                 b = p · 1 - k2

where k = mn . We claim that a = p and b = p · 1 - k2 are the required numbers.

Notice  that     b  =       -  k2.  Since  1  -  k2  is  not  a  square  number,  by  applying  [Lemma
                 a       1

10.28.0] we find that a, b are incommensurable. Since 1 - k2 is rational, a2, b2 are

commensurable.

Let  f  =        -  b2.  Then   a2  =  b2  +  f2.  Notice     that
             a2

                                    a2 - b2 = p2 - p2 · (1 - k2)
                                                = p2(1 - (1- k2))
                                                = p2k2

and so f = pk. Then

                                                  ap1
                                                     ==

                                                  f pk k

and so a and f are commensurable.

Proposition 10.30. CONSTRUCTION II.

We wish to construct rationally expressible numbers a and b such that a and b are
incommensurable, a2 and b2 are commensurable, and a2 = b2 + f 2 where a and f
are incommensurable.

Proof. Let p be rationally expressible and choose natural numbers m > n such that
m2 + n2 is not a square number. Let

                                          m2 + n2               p2

where   k  =  nm .  We   claim  that   a  =   p  and  b  =  p       are  the  required  numbers.

Since   a  =       +  k2  and  1 + k2  is  not  a  square   number,      by  applying  [Lemma  10.28.0]

we find that a, b are incommensurable. Since 1 + k2 is rational, a2, b2 are commen-

surable.

Let  f  =        -  b2.   Then  a2  =  b2  +  f2.  Notice  that

Then f =  pk 1+k2 . Notice that                       

                                                a  =    1 + k2

Applying [Lemma 10.10.1], we find that a, f are incommensurable.

Proposition 10.31. CONSTRUCTION III.

Let c be a medial number. We wish to find medial number d such that c and d are
incommensurable, c2 and d2 are commensurable, cd is rational, and c2 = d2 + t2
such that c and t are commensurable.

                                                                                                        
Proof. Using [10.29], construct rationally expressible numbers a and b = a · 1 - k2
where 0 < k < 1 is rational and 1 - k2 is rational but not a square number. Let

                                                                             1
[Lemma 10.21.0], (1 - k2)1/4 is also irrational. Since a is rationally expressible, by
[10.21], c = a · (1 - k2)1/4 is a medial number. Similarly, d is a medial number.

Notice that cd = 1 - k2. By [Lemma 10.28.0], c, d are incommensurable. Since
1 - k2 is rational, c2, d2 are commensurable.

Notice that cd = a2 · (1 - k2). By [Lemma 10.10.0], cd is rational.

Let  t  =        -  d2.  Then  c2  =  d2  +  t2.  Notice  that
             c2

                           c2 - d2 = a2 · (1 - k2)1/2 - a2 · (1 - k2)3/2
                                       = a2 [· (1 - k2)1/2 - (1 - k2)3/2]
                                       = a2 [( · (1 - k2)1/2) (1 - (1 - k2))]
                                                    
                                       = a2k2 · 1 - k2

and so t = ak · (1 - k2)1/4. Finally,             a · (1 - k2)1/4
                                          c       ak · (1 - k2)1/4
                                               =
                                          t       1
                                               =  k

Since k is rational, c and t are commensurable. This completes the construction.

Corollary. [10.31.1] Let c be a medial number. We wish to find medial number d
such that c and d are incommensurable, c2 and d2 are commensurable, cd is rational,
and c2 = d2 + t2 such that c and t are incommensurable.

from [10.30] where 0 < k < 1 is rational where 1 + k2 is rational but not a square

number. Let

We claim that c and d are the required numbers. We leave as an exercise to the
student to show that c, d are medial numbers. Notice that

                                    c a (1 + k2)3/4
                                    d = (1 + k2)1/4 · a

                                              
                                         = 1 + k2

By the proof of [10.30], c, d are incommensurable; also, c2, d2 are commensurable.

Also notice that cd = 1+k2 a2 is rational.

Let  t  =        -  d2;  then  c2  =  d2  +  t2.  First,  notice  that
             c2

                               c2 - d2 =             a2      -             a2

                                             = (1 + k2)3/2

                                                     ((           ))
                                                          1 + k2 - 1

                                                                    2 3/2

                                             = (1 + k2)3/2

Then t = a (1+k2k)3/4 . Finally,
                                    c a (1 + k2)3/4

Since 1 + k is irrational by the above, k is irrational [Lemma 10.10.1]. Hence,

c and t are incommensurable.

Proposition 10.32. CONSTRUCTION IV.

Let d be a medial number. We wish to find a medial number e such that d and e
are incommensurable, d2 and e2 are commensurable, de is a second medial number,
and d2 = e2 + t2 such that d and t are commensurable.

Proof. Construct rationally expressible numbers p, pm, p1 - k2 such that m is
rational, m is irrational, 1 - k2 is irrational, 1 - k2 is rational, and k = mn . Let

                                                 p              d
                                                         =
                                                 d              pm

                                                 d = p · m1/4

and

                                       p · m1/4                
                                          =                 p · 1 - k2

                                                 e = p · m1/4 · 1 - k2

We claim that d and e are the required medial numbers. By hypothesis, d is medial.
                        ( 2)                          2 ( 2)                            
Since e2 = p2 · 1 - k · m where p · 1 - k is rational and m is irrational, by

[Lemma 10.10.1] e2 is irrational. By [Lemma 10.21.0], e is also irrational. Since
                 (      2)2
e4 = p4m · 1 - k is rational by [Lemma 10.01.0], e is a medial number.

Notice that de = 1 - k2. Applying [Lemma 10.28.0], we find that e, d are incom-
mensurable. Since 1 - k2 is rational, e2, d2 are commensurable.

Notice that de = p2 · m - mk2. Since m - mk2 is rational, de is a second medial

number.

Let  t  =           -   e2.  Then  d2  =  e2  +  t2.  Notice    that
             d2

                               d2 - e2 = p2 · m - p2 · m · (1 - k2)
                                           = p2 · m · (1 - (1 - k2))
                                           = k2p2 · m

and  so    t  =  kp  ·  m1/4.  It  follows    that    t  =  k.  Hence,  d  and  t  are  commensurable.

Lemma. 10.32.1 Let d be a medial number. We wish to find a medial number
e such that d and e are incommensurable, d2 and e2 are commensurable, de is a
second medial number, and d2 = e2 + t2 such that d and t are incommensurable.

We claim that d, e are the required numbers. The remainder of the proof is left as
an exercise to the reader.

Lemma. 10.33.0 If x is irrational and y is rational, then x + y is irrational.

Proof. Suppose x + y is rational, or x + y = q where q is rational. It follows that
x = q - y. Since the RHS is rational, x is rational, a contradiction. Hence, x + y is
irrational.

Proposition 10.33. CONSTRUCTION V.

We wish to find numbers r and s where r2 and s2 are incommensurable, r2 + s2 is
rational, and rs is a second medial number.

Proof.  Using [10.30], construct rationally expressible numbers a = p and b =  p

and let x + y = p and xy = 4b2 for real numbers x, y.

                                   z - k = qz + qk
                                  z - qz = k + qk

Since k, q are rational, z is rational. But z = 1 + k2 is also irrational, a contradic-
tion. Hence, r2 and s2 are incommensurable.

Notice that

                                (                 )         (                )

                      = p2

and so r2 + s2 is rational.

                      = 2 · 1 + k2

Let t2 = 2p2 and w = k2+1 1 . Then rs = t2 · w. Since t2 is rational and w is irra-
tional, by [Lemma 10.10.1] rs is irrational. By [Lemma 10.21.0], rs is irrational.
Lastly, (rs)2 = t4w is rational, and so rs is a second medial number. This completes

the construction.

Proposition 10.34. CONSTRUCTION VI.

We wish to find numbers r and s such that r2 and s2 are incommensurable, where
r2 + s2 is a second medial number, and where rs is rational.

Proof. Using [Cor. 10.31.1], construct medial numbers p (1+k2)1/4 and p (1+k2)3/4 , and
let

we claim that r, s are the required numbers.

Notice  that  r2  =  xy .  By  [10.11],  r2  and   s2  are  incommensurable     if  and  only  if  x  and

                                          x = 2 · (1 + k2)3/4

Since xy = 4·(1+k2)3/2 p2 , we have

                                            1 + k2

Let q = 1+k2 1 . Then r2 + s2 = p2 · q is a second medial number.

Proposition 10.35. CONSTRUCTION VII.

We wish to construct r and s where r2 and s2 are incommensurable, r2 + s2 is a sec-
ond medial number, rs is a second medial number, and r2 + s2 is incommensurable
with rs.

Proof. Let

                           x + y = p · m1/4
                                            p2 · m

                              xy = 4 · (1 + k2)

for real numbers x, y. If

                           r2 = p · m1/4 · x
                           s2 = p · m1/4 · y

we claim that r, s are the required numbers.

Notice that

                                              p · m1/4 (                    )
                                                                      k
                                  x=               2 · 1 + 1 + k2

                                              p · m1/4 (                    )
                                                                      k
                                  y=               2 · 1 - 1 + k2

(we leave all verification steps to the student). Also notice that s2 r2 = yx and that
                                       x = 2k2  + 1 + 2k · k2 + 1
                                       y

By the proof of [10.34], x and y are incommensurable. By [10.11], r2 and s2 are
incommensurable if and only if x and y are incommensurable.
Notice that r2 + s2 = p2 · m, and so r2 + s2 is a second medial number.

Also notice that                                       p2 · m
                                              rs = 

                                                     2 · k2 + 1

Let t2 = 2p2 and w = k2+1 m . Then rs = t2 · w, and rs is a second medial number.

Finally, notice that                                      

                                         r2 + s2      = 2 · k2 + 1

                                               rs

Since         +  1  is  irrational,  r2  + s2    and  rs  are  incommensurable.        This  completes     the
         k2

construction.

Proposition 10.36. A BINOMIAL NUMBER IS IRRATIONAL.

Let a and b be rationally expressible numbers such that a and b are incommensu-
rable and a2 and b2 are commensurable. Then a + b, defined as a binomial number
[Def. 10.6], is irrational.

                                                                      It  follows  that   a  =  1 .    Apply-
Proof. Let a = p and b = p · k as in [10.21].                                             b        k

ing [Lemma 10.27.0], a and b are incommensurable.                         Since    a2  =  1k , a2  and b2  are
                                                                                   b2

commensurable.

Notice that

                        (                 )2                          
                           p + p · k = p2 + 2p2 · k + p2k

Since  p2  +  p2k   is  rational  and    2p2  ·       is  irrational  by  [Lemma   10.10.1],       by  [Lemma
                                                   k

10.33.0] (a + b)2 is irrational. By [10.21.0], a + b is irrational.

Proposition 10.37. A FIRST BIMEDIAL NUMBER IS IRRATIONAL.

Suppose a and b are medial numbers where a and b are incommensurable, a2 and b2
are commensurable, and ab is rational [10.27]. Then a+b, defined as a first bimedial
number [Def. 10.4], is irrational.

Proof. Let a = p · k1/4 and b = p · k3/4 as in [10.27]. Since ab = p2k, ab is rational.

Notice that                             a a2 1
                                          = =

                                        b ab k

where 1 is irrational. Clearly, a2, b2 are commensurable. Notice that

                k

                           a2 + b2        p2k + p2k · k
                                ab = p2k

                                                  
                                             k+k· k
                                          = 
                                                  k· k

                                               
                                          = k · (1 + k)

                                                      k

and so

                     a2 + 2ab + b2        =        
                                             2k + k · (1 + k)

                                ab                      k

                                (a + b)2  =        
                                             2k + k · (1 + k)

                                   2ab                  k

By [Lemma 10.33.0], the RHS is incommensurable. Since 2ab is rational, (a + b)2 is
irrational. By [Lemma 10.21.0], a + b is irrational.

Proposition 10.38. A SECOND BIMEDIAL NUMBER IS IRRATIONAL.

Suppose a and b are medial numbers where a and b are incommensurable, a2 and
b2 are commensurable, and ab is a second medial number. Then a + b, defined as a
second bimedial number [Def. 10.5], is irrational.

                                                               2
                1/4                 p· m
Proof. Let a = p · k and b = k1/4 as in [10.28]. Since ab = p · m, ab is second

medial number.

Notice that                             a a2 k
                                          = =

                                        b ab m

                                k
        k                       m
where     m  is irrational and      is rational.  Hence, a, b are incommensurable but

a2, b2 are commensurable.
414             CHAPTER 10. IRRATIONAL NUMBERS

Finally,

                                            
             a + b = p · k1/4 + k1/4 p · m

                                      
                p· k+p· m
             =         
                         k

If the RHS is rational, then p · k + p · m = q · k where q is rational. Hence

             p2k + 2p2km + p2m = q2k

                         q2k - p2k - p2m
                km = 2p2

                                      
Since the RHS is rational, km is rational for all choices of km, a contradiction.
Thus, a + b is irrational, which completes the proof.

Proposition 10.39. A MAJOR NUMBER IS IRRATIONAL.

Let r2 and s2 be incommensurable such that r2 + s2 is rational and rs is a second
medial number. We claim that r + s, defined as a major number [Def. 10.7], is
irrational.

Proof. Let

             2 p2 (               )
                            k
             r = 2 · 1 + 1 + k2

             2 p2 (               )
                            k
             s = 2 · 1 - 1 + k2

from [10.33]. It follows that r2 + s2 is rational and rs is a second medial number.

Notice that

             r2 1 + k2 + k
             s2 = 1 + k2 - k

                                           
                   = 2k2 + 1 + 2k · k2 + 1

By the proof of [10.34], r2 and s2 are incommensurable.
Also notice that

                                       (r + s)2 = r2 + s2 + 2rs
                                                    = p2 +  p2
                                                                   1 + k2
10.2. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 1-47                                  415

By [Lemma 10.33.0], the RHS is irrational; hence, (r + s)2 is irrational. By [Lemma
10.21.0], r + s is also irrational.

Proposition 10.40. CONSTRUCTION OF A "ROOT OF A RATIONAL PLUS A
SECOND MEDIAL NUMBER" [RPSM] NUMBER.

Let r2 and s2 be incommensurable such that r2 + s2 is a second medial number and
where rs is rational. We claim that r + s, defined as a RPSM number [Def. 10.9], is
irrational.

Proof. Let

                                 (            )
               p2 k + 1 + k2
            2r= ·

               2                    1+k    2

                                 (            )
               p2 -k + 1 + k2
            s= ·2

               2                    1+k    2

from [10.34]. By the proof of [10.34], r2 and s2 are incommensurable. Notice that

            r2 + s2 =               p2 
                                          · 1 + k2
                                 1 + k2

                                p2
               rs = 2 · (1 + k2)

and so r2 + s2 is a second medial number and rs is rational.
Also notice that

                                       (r + s)2 = r2 + s2 + 2rs

By [Lemma 10.33.0], the RHS is irrational; hence, (r + s)2 is irrational. By [Lemma
10.21.0], r + s is also irrational.

Proposition 10.41. CONSTRUCTION OF A "ROOT OF THE SUM OF TWO SEC-
OND MEDIAL NUMBERS" [RSSM] NUMBER.

Let r2 and s2 be incommensurable such that r2 + s2 and rs are each second medial
numbers, and where r2+s2 is incommensurable with rs. We claim that r+s, defined
as a RSSM number [Def. 10.8], is irrational.
416                                       CHAPTER 10. IRRATIONAL NUMBERS

Proof. Using [10.35], let

                           2 p2 · m (                      )
                                                     k
                           r=       2 · 1 + 1 + k2

                           2 p2 · m (                      )
                                                     k
                           s=       2 · 1 - 1 + k2

By the proof of [10.35], r2 and s2 are incommensurable. Notice that
                                         r2 + s2 = p2 · m
                                                              p2m
                                               rs = 
                                                           2 · 1 + k2

and so r2 + s2 and rs are each second medial numbers. Also,

                           r2 + s2          
                                          = 2 · 1 + k2
                               rs

and so r2 + s2 is incommensurable with rs. Finally,

                           r2 + 2rs + s2      
                                          = 2 + 2 · 1 + k2
                           rs

                           (r + s)2  = 2 + 2 · 1 + k2

Since the RHS is irrational, (r + s)2 is irrational. By [10.21.0], r+s is irrational.

Proposition 10.42. THE TERMS OF A BINOMIAL NUMBER ARE UNIQUE.

Let n be a binomial number. If n = a + b = c + d and a = d, then a = c and b = d.

Proof. Suppose n is a binomial number such that n = a + b = c + d where a = d and
a > c. Notice that

                                           n2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
                                                 = c2 + 2cd + d2

and so

              (a2 - c2) + (b2 - d2) = 2 · (cd - ab)
        1 · ((a2 - c2) + (b2 - d2)) = cd - ab
        2

By [10.36], a, b, c, d are rationally expressible, and so the LHS is rational. Also from
                                                              2        2
[10.36] a = p, b = p k, c = r, and d = r m, and so cd = r m and ab = p k. By
10.2. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 1-47                417

[10.26], the RHS is irrational, a contradiction. A similar contradiction arises if we
assume a < c.

Therefore, a = c. To prevent a similar contradiction, we must also have b = d. Thus,
the terms of a binomial number are unique.

Lemma. 10.43.0 If a and b are medial numbers such that a and b are commensu-
rable, then a ± b is also a medial number.

Proof. Since a and b are commensurable, a = bq where q is rational. Then a ± b =
b · (q ± 1). Since b and b · (q ± 1) are commensurable, by [10.23] b · (q ± 1) is a medial
number.

Lemma. 10.43.1 If a and b are second medial numbers such that a and b are com-
mensurable, then a ± b is also a second medial number.

Proof. The proof is identical to the above except that [Cor. 10.23.1] is cited instead.

Proposition 10.43. THE TERMS OF A FIRST BIMEDIAL NUMBER ARE UNIQUE.

Let n be a bimedial number. If n = a + b = c + d and a = d, then a = c and b = d.

Proof. Suppose n is a bimedial number such that n = a + b = c + d and a > c. Notice
that

                                           n2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
                                                 = c2 + 2cd + d2

and so

        (a2 + c2) - (b2 + d2) = 2 · (cd - ab)

By [10.37], ab, cd are rational; by [Lemma 10.10.0], the RHS is rational. Also by
[10.37], a2, b2, c2, d2 are second medial numbers. By [Lemma 10.43.1], a2 + c2 and
b2 + d2 are also second medial numbers. By [10.26], the LHS is irrational, a contra-
diction. A similar contradiction arises if we assume a < c.

Therefore, a = c. To prevent a similar contradiction, we must also have b = d. Thus,
the terms of a first bimedial number are unique.

Proposition 10.44. THE TERMS OF A SECOND BIMEDIAL NUMBER ARE
UNIQUE.

Let n be a second bimedial number. If n = a + b = c + d and a = d, then a = c and
b = d.

Proof. Suppose n is a second bimedial number such that n = a + b = c + d and a > c.
Notice that

                                           n2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
                                                 = c2 + 2cd + d2

By [10.38], a and b are medial numbers where a and b are incommensurable. It
follows that a2 and ab are incommensurable. Since a2 and b2 are commensurable,
a2 + b2 and a2 are commensurable [10.38]. Clearly, ab and 2ab are commensurable.

It follows that a2 + b2 and 2ab are incommensurable [10.13]. Let u = a2 + b2 and
v = 2ab; notice that u, v are incommensurable.

Since  u2 (k + 1)2
       v2 = 4k

u2, v2 are commensurable and u, v are incommensurable.

By [Def. 10.5], a2, b2 are commensurable, and so let a2 = k · b2 where k is rational.
Since u2 = a4 + 2a2b2 + b4 and v2 = 4a2b2, we obtain

       u2 = k2 · b4 + 2k · b4 + b4
             = b4 · (k2 + 2k + 1)
             = b4 · (k + 1)2

and v2 = b4 · 4k. Notice that u, v are rationally expressible.

By [10.36], u + v is a binomial number. By [10.42], u, v are unique. Thus, if a = d,
then a = c and b = d.

Proposition 10.45. A MAJOR NUMBER HAS UNIQUE TERMS.

Let n be a major number. If n = a + b = c + d and a = d, then a = c and b = d.

Proof. Suppose n is a major number such that n = a + b = c + d and a > c. Notice
that

                                           n2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
                                                 = c2 + 2cd + d2
10.2. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 1-47                419

and so

        (a2 + c2) - (b2 + d2) = 2 · (cd - ab)

By [10.39], the LHS is rational while cd and ab are second medial numbers. By
[10.26], the RHS is irrational, a contradiction. Then if a = d, a = c. To prevent a
similar contradiction, we must also have b = d. Thus, the terms of a major number
are unique.

Proposition 10.46. TERMS OF A "ROOT OF A RATIONAL PLUS A SECOND
MEDIAL NUMBER" [RPSM] NUMBER ARE UNIQUE.

Let n be a RPSM number. If n = a + b = c + d and a = d, then a = c and b = d.

Proof. Suppose n is a RPSM number such that n = a + b = c + d and a > c. Notice
that

                                           n2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
                                                 = c2 + 2cd + d2

and so

        (a2 + c2) - (b2 + d2) = 2 · (cd - ab)

By [10.40] and [Lemma 10.43.1], the LHS is a second medial number, and hence is
irrational.

By [10.40], the RHS is rational, a contradiction. Then if a = d, a = c. To prevent a
similar contradiction, we must also have b = d. Thus, the terms of a RPSM number
are unique.

Proposition 10.47. TERMS OF A "ROOT OF THE SUM OF TWO SECOND ME-
DIAL NUMBERS" [RSSM] NUMBER ARE UNIQUE.

Let n be a RSSM. If n = a + b = c + d and a = d, then a = c and b = d.

Proof. Suppose n is a RSSM such that n = a + b = c + d and a > c. Notice that
                                           n2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
                                                 = c2 + 2cd + d2
420  CHAPTER 10. IRRATIONAL NUMBERS

Let u = a2 +b2 and v = 2ab. By [10.41], a2 +b2 and ab are incommensurable. Clearly,
ab and 2ab are commensurable, and so a2 + b2 and 2ab are incommensurable [10.13].
Hence, u and v are incommensurable.
By [10.41], a2 + b2 and ab are second medial numbers, and so (a2 + b2)2 and (ab)2
are rational. Since u2 = a4 + 2a2b2 + b4 and v2 = 4a2b2, we have

     u2 = k2 · b4 + 2k · b4 + b4
           = b4 · (k2 + 2k + 1)
           = b4 · (k + 1)2

and v2 = b4 · 4k. Notice that u, v are rationally expressible, and since

                                                u2 (k + 1)2
                                                v2 = 4k
we find that u2, v2 are commensurable.
By [10.36], u + v is a binomial number. By [10.42], u, v are unique. Thus, if a = d,
then a = c and b = d. Thus, the terms of a RSSM number are unique.

10.3 Book X, Propositions 48-84

Definitions.

Let n = a + b be a binomial number. Euclidean number theory constructs six types
of binomial numbers. Let p be rationally expressible.

      (6a) n is a first binomial number when a and p are commensurable and a2 =
b2 + h2 where h is commensurable with a.

      (6b) n is a second binomial number when b and p are commensurable and a2 =
b2 + h2 where h is commensurable with a.

      (6c) n is a third binomial number when both a and b are incommensurable with
p, and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is commensurable with a.

      (6d) n is a fourth binomial number when a and p are commensurable and a2 =
b2 + h2 where h is incommensurable with a.

      (6e) n is a fifth binomial number when b and p are commensurable and a2 =
b2 + h2 where h is incommensurable with a.

      (6f) n is a sixth binomial number when both a and b are incommensurable with
p, and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is incommensurable with a.

10. Let a and b be rationally expressible such that a and b are incommensurable
but a2 and b2 are commensurable. We define a - b as an apotome number (or simply
an apotome).
10.3. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 48-84                                              421

Remark. Apotome is Greek for "portion cut off", i.e., instead of propositions about
irrational sums, we have propositions about irrational differences.

[10.73] proves that both a - b and (a - b)2 are irrational.

Euclidean number theory constructs six types of apotome numbers. Let p be ratio-
nally expressible, and assume a > b.

      (a) a-b is a first apotome iff a and p are commensurable, and a2 = b2 +h2 where
h is commensurable with a.

      (b) a - b is a second apotome iff b and p are commensurable, and a2 = b2 + h2
where h is commensurable with a.

      (c) a - b is a third apotome iff both a and b are incommensurable with p, and
a2 = b2 + h2 where h is commensurable with a.

      (d) a - b is a fourth apotome iff a and p are commensurable, and a2 = b2 + h2
where h is incommensurable with a.

      (e) a - b is a fifth apotome iff b and p are commensurable, and a2 = b2 + h2 where
h is incommensurable with a.

      (f) a - b is a sixth apotome iff both a and b are incommensurable with p, and
a2 = b2 + h2 where h is incommensurable with a.

Let a - b be an apotome and let z be rationally expressible. By [10.73], a - b + z
and z are each rationally expressible, a - b + z and z are incommensurable, and
(a - b + z)2 and z2 are commensurable. By [10.79], z is unique. We sometimes refer
to z as an "annex" of a - b.

Remark. Binomial numbers, like apotome numbers, are roots of the equation
                              x4 - 2 · (1 + k) · p2 · x3 + (1 - k)2 · p4 = 0

11. Let a and b be medial numbers such that a > b where a and b are incommensu-
rable but a2 and b2 are commensurable, and where ab is rational. We define a - b as
a first apotome of a medial.
[10.74] proves that a - b is irrational.

12. Let a and b be medial numbers such that a > b where a and b are incommensu-
rable but a2 and b2 are commensurable, and where ab is second medial number. We
define a - b as a second apotome of a medial.
[10.75] proves that a - b is irrational.

13. Let a > b where a and b are incommensurable, a2 and b2 are incommensurable,
a2 + b2 is rational, and ab is a second medial number. We define a - b as a minor
number.
422                                       CHAPTER 10. IRRATIONAL NUMBERS

[10.76] proves that a - b is irrational.

14. Let a > b where a and b are incommensurable, a2 and b2 are incommensurable,
a2 + b2 is a second medial number, and where 2ab is a rational number. We define
a - b as a WR-medial. (WR stands for "with rational".)

[10.77] proves that a - b is irrational.

15. Suppose a and b exist such that a > b where a and b are incommensurable,
a2 and b2 are incommensurable, a2 + b2 is a second medial number, where 2ab is a
second medial number, and where a2 + b2 and 2ab are incommensurable. We define
a - b as a WM-medial. (WM stands for "with medial".)

[10.78] proves that a - b is irrational.

Lemma. 10.48.0 If d is rationally expressible, and d and e be commensurable, then
e is also rationally expressible. Let

                                                      d
                                                        =k

                                                      e

where k is rational. Then       ( d 2 )2
                                         =e

                                  k

By the above, the LHS is rational, and so e2 is rational. Thus, e is rationally ex-
pressible.

Proposition 10.48. CONSTRUCTING A FIRST BINOMIAL NUMBER.

If p is rationally expressible, then n = a + b is a first binomial number when a and
p are commensurable and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is commensurable with a.

Proof. Let p be rationally expressible and construct kp such that p and kp are com-

mensurable. By [Lemma 10.48.0], kp is rationally expressible. Also construct pn2
     ( 2 2)
and p · m - n where m, n are natural numbers such that m - n is not a square22

number. Notice that

                           pm2            k2p2
                     p · (m2 - n2) = b2

                                           k2p2 · (m2 - n2)
                                b2 = m2

                                b = kp · 1 - c2
10.3. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 48-84                                     423

where c = nm . Let a = kp (and so a and p are commensurable). We claim that
n = a + b is a first binomial number.

Notice that that a and b are rationally expressible, that a and b are incommensu-
rable [Lemma 10.28.0], and that a2 and b2 are commensurable. By [10.36], a + b is
a binomial number.

Suppose a2 - b2 = h2 for some real h. Notice that a2 = b2 + h2, and

pm2                                     a2
p · (m2 - n2) = b2

m2 - n2                                 b2
                                     = a2
m2

m2 - n2 - m2                            b2 - a2
                                     = a2
m2

     n2                                 a2 - b2
     m2 = a2

     n2                                 h2
     m2 = a2

                                  n  =  h

     m                                  a

Hence, a and h are commensurable, which completes the construction.

Remark. A first binomial number can be written in the form

Proposition 10.49. CONSTRUCTING A SECOND BINOMIAL NUMBER.

If p be rationally expressible, then n = a + b is a second binomial number when b
and p are commensurable and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is commensurable with a.

Proof. Let p be rationally expressible and k be rational. Then p and kp are com-
mensurable. By [Lemma 10.48.0], kp is rationally expressible. Also construct pn2

and p · (m2 - n2) where m, n are natural numbers such that m2 - n2 is not a square

number. Notice that

                          a2 = k2p2m2

where c = mn . Let b = kp (and so b and p are commensurable). We claim that
n = a + b is a second binomial number.

Notice that that a and b are rationally expressible, that a and b are incommensu-
rable [Lemma 10.28.0], and that a2 and b2 are commensurable. By [10.36], a + b is
a binomial number.

Let a2 - b2 = h2. Notice that a2 = b2 + h2, and

                     p · (m2 - n2) b2
                                       = a2

                     m2 - n2                     b2
                                       = a2
                          m2

                     m2 - n2 - m2                b2 - a2
                                       = a2
                     m2

                          n2                     h2
                          m2 = a2

                                    n  =         h

                                    m            a

and so a and h are commensurable. This completes the construction.

Remark. A second binomial number can be written in the form
                                           a + b = kp +  kp

Proposition 10.50. CONSTRUCTING A THIRD BINOMIAL NUMBER.

If p be rationally expressible, then n = a + b is a third binomial number when both
a and b are incommensurable with p, and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is commensurable
with a.

Proof. Let p be rationally expressible. Construct q · (m2 - n2) and qn2 where m, n

are natural numbers such that m2 - n2 is not a square number and where q isq
                                                                         qt
rational.  Also  construct  t  such  that     is  rational  but  t is irrational. Notice that

                                     t             p2
                                     qm2 = a2

                                     a2            m2q
                                     p2 = t

                                        p = m· t

                                           a = pm · t

It follows that a, p are incommensurable and that a is rationally expressible. Also
notice that

where c = nm . It follows that b, p are incommensurable.

Since a is rationally expressible, b is rationally expressible. Notice that a, b are
incommensurable but a2, b2 are commensurable. By [10.36], a + b is a binomial
number.

Then a and h are commensurable, which completes the construction.

Proposition 10.51. CONSTRUCTING A FOURTH BINOMIAL NUMBER.

If p be rationally expressible, then n = a + b is a fourth binomial number when a

where c = mn . Let a = kp. Notice that a = kp and b = a·1 + c are incommensurable
but a2 and b2 are commensurable. Since a2 and b2 are rational, a and b are rationally

expressible. By [10.36], a + b is a binomial number.

Clearly, a, p are commensurable. Suppose a2 - b2 = h2. Then a2 = b2 + h2 and

          m+n                     =  a

and so a and h are incommensurable, which completes the construction.

Proposition 10.53. CONSTRUCTING A SIXTH BINOMIAL NUMBER.

If p be rationally expressible, then n = a + b is a sixth binomial number when both
a and b are incommensurable with p, and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is incommensurable

Proof. Let p be rationally expressible. Construct natural numbers m, n such that

n m+n = s2 r2 and m m+n = s2 r2 for any natural numbers r, s.       Construct t such that

m+n   =   r2  for  any  natural  r, s.  Consider

                                           n = kp + kp · 1 - c2
pn is a binomial number.

Proof. Construct u + v = kp and uv = 41 · k2p2 · (1 - c2) where k is rational, kp is

                               u = 2 · kp · (1 + c)

If x2 = pu and y2 = pv, we claim that x + y = pn.

Notice that

Also notice that x, y are rationally expressible, that x2, y2 are commensurable, and
that x and y are incommensurable. By [10.36], x + y is a binomial number.
Since

                                       x2 + y2 = p2k

                                                                
                                            2xy = p2k · 1 - c2

it follows that

                                          = pn

Hence, x + y = pn is a binomial number.

If x2 = pu and y2 = pv, we claim that x + y = pn.

Since

                                 y2 = 1 - c

x, y are incommensurable and x2, y2 are commensurable.
                                         
Notice that u = 2kp · 1-c2 (1+c)2 and v = 2kp · 1-c2 (1-c)2 are second medial numbers; since

x2 = pu and y2 = pv, it follows that x, y are medial numbers. Finally, xy = 2 kp2 , and

so xy is rational. By [10.37], x + y is a first bimedial number.

Notice that

                    x2 + y2 =  kp2
                                         1 - c2

                                 2xy = kp2

Then

                    (x + y)2 = x2 + y2 + 2xy

                                 = kp2 +  kp2

                                 = np

and so x + y = np, which completes the proof.

If x2 = pu and y2 = pv, we claim that x + y = pn.
Notice that x, y are medial numbers where x, y are incommensurable and x2, y2 are

commensurable. Also notice that xy = 2p2 · k · (1 - m ), and so xy is a second
medial number. By [10.38], x + y is a second bimedial number.

Since
                                       x2 + y2 = p2k

                                           
                       2xy = p2k · 1 - m2

we obtain

pn is a major number.

Proof. Construct u + v = kp and uv = 41 · 1+m k2p2 where k is rational such that k = r2

If x2 = pu and y2 = pv, then we claim that x + y = pn.

Notice that x2 and y2 are incommensurable and that x2 + y2 = p2k is rational. Also,

xy = 2 p2k · m+1 1 . Since p is rationally expressible and k is rational, q = 2 p2k is
                                                        
rational. Since n is a fourth binomial number, m + 1 is irrational, and so xy =
       1
q·   m+1  is  a  second  medial  number.  By  [10.39],  x  +  y  is  a  major  number.

Since

                                 x2 + y2 = p2k

                                                 p2k

we obtain

                                            n = kp + kp · 1 + c
pn is a RPSM number.

Proof.  Construct u + v                          =  1  · k2p2  where k      is rational such that
                            = kp · 1 + c and uv     4

k = r2 for any natural r and where kp is rationally expressible. Solving for u, v, we

obtain

                                 u = 2 · c+ c+1

                                 v = 2 · c- c+1

If x2 = pu and y2 = pv, then we claim that x + y = pn.

Clearly,  x2  and  y2  are  incommensurable.  Notice   that   x2  +  y2  =  p2k  ·       +  1.  Since  n

is fifth binomial number, c + 1 is rationally expressible. Hence, x2 + y2 is a second

medial number. Also, xy = 2 p2k is rational. By [10.40], x + y is a RPSM number.

Since

                   2xy = p2k

we obtain

             (x + y)2 = p2k + p2k · c + 1
                          = np

and so x + y = np, which completes the construction.

pn is a RSSM number.

Proof. Construct u + v = p · k and uv = 4 p2m where k is rational such that k = r2

Clearly, x2 and y2 are incommensurable. Notice that x2 + y2 = p2k and that
       p2 
xy = 2 · 1 - m, and so x + y and xy are second medial numbers. Finally notice22

that x2 + y2 and xy are incommensurable; by [10.41], x + y is an RSSM number.

Notice that

Proposition 10.60. FACTORS OF A SQUARE I.

If n = p + pk is a binomial number, then a first binomial number is a factor of n2.

                            
Proof. Let n = p + p k be a binomial number. Also let x, y, z be real numbers such
that sx = p2, sy = p2k, and 2sz = 2p2k such that p, s are rationally expressible,


  k is irrational, k is rational, and where x + y > 2z. Notice that

                                                             n2
                                                        =

                                                              s

We claim that (x + y) + 2z is a first binomial number where its terms are x + y and

2z.
Since x + y = p2 · s ( 1+k ) where p, s are rationally expressible and k is rational, it
follows that x + y is rationally expressible. Since 2z = s 2p2 k , 2z is also rationally
expressible. Notice that

                    (x + y)2             2 (1 + k)2 s2
                              = p· 2 · 4
                    (2z)2                       s  4p k

                                   (1 + k)2
                              = 4p2k

and so (x + y)2 and (2z)2 are commensurable while x + y and 2z are incommensu-
rable. By [10.36], (x + y) + 2z is a binomial number.

By hypothesis s is rationally expressible, and

                    x+y                  p2
                           s = s2 · (1 + k)

where p2, s2 and 1 + k are rational. Hence, x + y and s are commensurable.

and so h = sp2 · (k - 1). Finally,

                                         k-1

Since k is rational, x + y and h are commensurable. By [10.48], (x + y) + 2z is a first
binomial number and a factor of n2.

Proof. Let n = p · k1/4 + p · k3/4 be a first bimedial number. Also let x, y, z be real

it follows that x + y is rationally expressible. Since 2z = s 2p2k , 2z is also rationally

       (2z)2 =                                                     · 4p4k2

                    =

                             4k

and so (x + y)2 and (2z)2 are commensurable while x + y and 2z are incommensu-
rable. By [10.36], (x + y) + 2z is a binomial number.

By hypothesis, s is rationally expressible, and

                          2z                     2p2k
                                                 s = s2

where p2, s2 and k are rational. Hence, 2z and s are commensurable.

           
Let h = (x + y)2 - (2z)2. Then (x + y)2 = (2z)2 + h2.

Notice that (2z) = s = s2 . Since (x + y) = s2 ,

                2 2 p4k · (k2 + 2k + 1) - p4k · (4k)
       (x + y) - (2z) = s2

                                     p4k · (k2 - 2k + 1)
                               = s2

                         p4k · (k - 1)2
                    = s2

                                     p2 k·(k-1)

it follows that h = s . Then

       h p2k · (k - 1) s
                 =                               s · p2k · (k + 1)
       x+y

       = k-1
            k+1

and so x + y and h are commensurable. By [10.49], (x + y) + 2z is a second binomial
number and a factor of n2.

Proposition 10.62. FACTORS OF A SQUARE III.

If n = pk1/4 +pk-1/4m is a second bimedial number, then a third binomial number
is a factor of n2.

Proof. Let n = pk1/4 + pk-1/4m be a second bimedial number. Also let x, y, z be
real numbers such that sx = p2k, sy = mp2k-1/2, and 2sz = 2p2m such that p, s

                                    
are rationally expressible, k is irrational, k is rational, and x + y > 2z. Notice that

                                                   p2k + mp2k-1/2 + 2p2m

                                                                     s

                                             =
                                                    s

We claim that (x + y) + 2z is a third binomial number such that its terms are x + y
and 2z.

Notice that (x + y)2 = s2 p4k+m2p4k-1+2mp4 and (2z)2 = s2 4p4m where p, s are rationally
expressible and k, m are rational. Hence, x + y and 2z are rationally expressible.

Notice that

                 (2z)2 =                             · 4p4m

                                           4km

It follows that (x + y)2 and (2z)2 are commensurable but x + y and 2z are incom-
mensurable. By [10.36], (x + y) + 2z is a binomial number.

Now notice that

                 x+y             =  p2k + mp2k-1/2

                              s          s

                              s = s2

and so s is incommensurable with both x + y and 2z.

Let h = (x + y)2 - (2z)2. Then (x + y)2 = (2z)2 + h2. Notice that

                                     ks

and so h =  p2  · (k - m). Finally, notice that

                                   k+m

and so h and x + y are commensurable. By [10.50], (x + y) + 2z is a third binomial
number and a factor of n2.

Proposition 10.63. FACTORS OF A SQUARE IV.

                                     
Let u = p2 · 1 +  k  1+k2 and v = p2 · 1 -  k 1+k2 where p is rationally expressible,
k is rational, and k is irrational.

If n = u + v is a major number, then a fourth binomial number is a factor of n2.

Proof. Let n = u + v is a major number, and let s be rationally expressible. By

[10.39], u2 and v2 are incommensurable, u + v is rational, and uv is medial.
Also let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = u2, sy = v2, and 2sz = 2uv. Notice
that

10.3. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 48-84                                       441

We claim that (x + y) + 2z is a fourth binomial number such that its terms are x + y
and 2z.

Notice that x + y = u2+v2 s . Since u2 + v2 is rational and s is rationally expressible,
                                                                 p2
x + y is rationally expressible.  Also notice that 2z   =             , and so 2z is also
                                                            2s· 1+k2

Notice that

                                     = 4 · (1 + k2)

and so (x + y)2 and (2z)2 are commensurable. Since k may be any rational number,
x + y and 2z are incommensurable. By [10.36], (x + y) + 2z is a binomial number.

Notice that

Since p, s are rationally expressible, x + y and s are commensurable.

where p is rationally expressible, k is rational, k is irrational, and 1 + k2 is not a
square number.

If n = u + v is a RPSM number, then a fifth binomial number is a factor of n2.

Proof. By [Def. 10.9], n = u + v is a RPSM number when u2 and v2 are incommen-
surable, u2 + v2 is a second medial number, and uv is rational. First, we wish to
show that n is a RPSM number.

Notice that

If u2, v2 are commensurable, then

                                 1 + k2 + k = q · 1 + k2 - k

where q is rational. It follows that

                                         
                        1 + k2 - q · 1 + k2 = -k - qk

Since k, q are rational, the RHS is rational. But the LHS is irrational by hypothesis,
a contradiction. Hence, u2, v2 are incommensurable.

Also notice that

                                     2 · (1 + k )2

                                        
                                              1

                               = p · 1 + k2

and so u2 + v2 is a second medial number. Finally, notice that

                                     (             ) (                       )

                               p2 ·      1 + k2 + k ·            1 + k2 - k

                   uv =                         2 · (1 + k2)

                           p2 · 1 + k2 - k2
                      = 2 · (1 + k2)

                                 p2
                      = 2 · (1 + k2)

and so uv is rational. It follows that n = u + v is a RPSM number [10.40].
Let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = u2, sy = v2, and 2sz = 2uv. Notice that

                                                            u2 + 2uv + v2

We claim that (x + y) + 2z is a fifth binomial number such that its terms are x + y
and 2z.

Notice  that  x+y  =  u2 +v 2  where  s  is  rationally  expressible.  By  the  above,  u2  + v2  =

m2 where m2 is a second medial number. Hence, (x + y)2 = s2 m4 , and so x + y is

rationally  expressible.       Since   uv  is  rational,   2z  =  uv   is  rationally  expressible.
                                                                   s

Since 1 + k2 is not a square number, x + y and 2z are incommensurable. Also notice
that (x + y)2 and (2z)2 are commensurable. By [10.36], (x + y) + 2z is a binomial

number.

Notice  that  2z  =  uv    is  rational,   and  so  2z  and    s  are  commensurable.

Let h = (x + y)2 - (2z)2. Then (x + y)2 = (2z)2 + h2. Notice that

If h and x + y are commensurable, then k2+1 is rational for all k. But if k = 2,

       2 
then k2+1 4k +3 = 633 , a contradiction. Thus, h and x + y are incommensurable. By
[10.52], (x + y) + 2z is a fifth binomial number and a factor of n2.

Proposition 10.65. FACTORS OF A SQUARE VI.

Let

                                                   

                            u=         pm1/4         1+  k

where p is rationally expressible, k is rational, k is irrational, 1+k2 is not a square
                 
number,   m1/4,    m  are  irrational  but  m  is  rational.

If n = u + v is a RSSM number, then a sixth binomial number is a factor of n2.

Proof. By [Def. 10.8], n = u + v is a RSSM number when u and v are incommen-
surable, u2 and v2 are incommensurable, u2 + v2 and uv are each a second medial
numbers, and uv is incommensurable with u2 + v2.

We wish to show n is a RSSM number. Notice that
                                             u2 1 + k2 + k
                                             v2 = 1 + k2 - k

By the proof of [10.64], u2, v2 are incommensurable. Notice that

                            u +v =2    2           p2m

                                                     2

                                                   p2  m
                                       uv = 2 · 1 + k2

and so u2 + v2 and uv are second medial numbers.

Finally,                               u2 + v2 
                                                 = 1 + k2

                                          uv

and so uv is incommensurable with u2 + v2. It follows that n = u + v is a RSSM
number [10.41].

Let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = u2, sy = v2, and 2sz = 2uv. Notice that

                                                    u2 + 2uv + v2
                            (x + y) + 2z =

                                                             s

                                               =

                                                     s

We claim that (x + y) + 2z is a sixth binomial number such that its terms are x + y

and 2z.                                     p2  m

                      p2 m
Notice that x + y = 2s and 2z = 2s · 1+k2 , and so x + y and 2z are rationally
expressible. Since 2z x+y = 1 + k2, we find that x + y and 2z are incommensurable
446                                                 CHAPTER 10. IRRATIONAL NUMBERS

but (x + y)2 and (2z)2 are commensurable. By [10.36], (x + y) + 2z is a binomial
number.

Recall that p is rationally expressible. Notice that

                                                    
                                   x+y              pm
                                                 =
                                   p                2s

                                          2z        p       m

                                          p = 2s · 1 + k2

and so p is incommensurable to both x + y and 2z.
           

Let h = (x + y)2 - (2z)2. Then (x + y)2 = (2z)2 + h2. Notice that

                                2             2     p4m        p4m
                       (x + y) - (2z) = 2 -
                                                    4s 4s · (1 + k )2     2

                                                 =  p4m · (1 + k2) - p4m

                                                          4s2 · (1 + k2)

                                                           p4k2m
                                                 = 4s2 · (1 + k2)

               2
and  so  h  =  pk   ·    m   .  Finally,
                2s     1+k2

                                  h              p2k  m 2s
                                          =      2s · 1 + k2 · pm

                                x+y

                                          =  pk
                                                  1 + k2

and so h and x + y are incommensurable. By [10.53], (x + y) + 2z is a sixth binomial
number and a factor of n2.

Remark. [10.59] iff [10.65].

Remark. We may summarize the previous six propositions as: let v2 = pr where p
is rationally expressible. Then:

   (1) If v is a medial number (and hence v2 is a second medial number), then r is a
first binomial.

   (2) If v is a first bimedial number, then r is a second binomial.
   (3) If v is a second bimedial number, then r is a third binomial.
   (4) If v is a major number, then r is a fourth binomial.
   (5) If v is a RPSM number, then r is a fifth binomial.
   (6) If v is a RSSM number, then r is a sixth binomial.

Proposition 10.66. NUMBERS COMMENSURABLE WITH BINOMIAL NUM-
BERS ARE BINOMIAL.

Suppose a = m + n is a binomial number where a is a first, second, third, fourth,
fifth, or sixth binomial number. Also suppose that a and c are commensurable. We
claim that c is a binomial number of the same type as a.

Proof. Since a and c are commensurable, c = qa where q is rational. Since a is a
binomial number, by [10.36] a contains a rationally expressible term p. Since q is
rational, qp is rationally expressible. Since q has no effect on any other component
of a, c is a binomial number of the same type as a.

Proposition 10.67. NUMBERS COMMENSURABLE WITH BIMEDIAL NUM-
BERS ARE BIMEDIAL.

Suppose a = m + n is a bimedial number where a is a first or second bimedial num-
ber. Also suppose that a and c are commensurable. We claim that c is a bimedial
number of the same type as a.

Proof. The proof is similar to [10.66] as is left as an exercise to the reader.

Proposition 10.68. NUMBERS COMMENSURABLE WITH MAJOR NUMBERS
ARE MAJOR.

Suppose a = m+n is a major number. Also suppose that a and c are commensurable.
We claim that c is a major number.

Proof. The proof is similar to [10.66] as is left as an exercise to the reader.

Proposition 10.69. NUMBERS COMMENSURABLE WITH RPSM NUMBERS
ARE RPSM.

Suppose a = m + n is a RPSM number. Also suppose that a and c are commensu-
rable. We claim that c is a RPSM number.

Proof. The proof is similar to [10.66] as is left as an exercise to the reader.

Proposition 10.70. NUMBERS COMMENSURABLE WITH RSSM NUMBERS
ARE RSSM.

Suppose a = m + n is a RSSM number. Also suppose that a and c are commensu-
rable. We claim that c is a RSSM number.

Proof. The proof is similar to [10.66] as is left as an exercise to the reader.

Proposition 10.71. SQUARE ROOT OF THE SUM OF A RATIONAL AND A
SECOND MEDIAL NUMBER.

If kp2 is rational and p2m is a second medial number, then p · k + m is either
a bimedial number, a binomial number, a major number, or a RPSM number.

Proof. Let su = kp2 and sv = p2m where s is rationally expressible. Notice that
u2 = s2 k2p4 and v2 = s2 p4m are rational, and so u, v are rationally expressible. Since

         u  k
            =
         v     m

u, v are incommensurable but u2, v2 are commensurable. By [10.36], u + v is a
binomial number.
First case: v < u. Since su = s2 kp2 , u and s are commensurable. If u2 - v2 and u are
commensurable, then u + v is a first binomial number. Otherwise, u + v is a fourth
binomial number.

          
Hence, s · (u + v) is a binomial number [10.54] or a major number [10.57].

                                                                                        
Second case: u < v. As above, u and s are commensurable. If v2 - u2 and u are
commensurable, then u + v is a second binomial number. Otherwise, u + v is a fifth
binomial number.

          
Hence, s · (u + v) is a first bimedial number [10.55] or a RPSM number [10.58].

Proposition 10.72. SQUARE ROOT OF THE SUM OF TWO INCOMMENSU-
RABLE SECOND MEDIAL NUMBERS.

                                                       
If p2 k and p2 m are incommensurable second medial numbers, then p· k + m

is either a second bimedial number or a RSSM number.
10.3. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 48-84                             449

Proof. Let u = p2k and v = p2m. Notice that u, v are rationally expressible and
incommensurable and that u2, v2 are commensurable. By [10.36], u+v is a binomial

number.
                   

Suppose that u2 - v2 is commensurable with u. Then u + v is a third binomial
                                 

number, and by [10.56] s · (u + v) is a second bimedial number.
                                                                                    

Otherwise, u + v is a sixth binomial number, and by [10.59], s · (u + v) is a RSSM
number.

Proposition 10.73. APOTOME NUMBERS I.

Let x > y be rationally expressible such that x and y are incommensurable but x2

and y2 are commensurable. By [Def. 10.10], x - y is an apotome number. Both x - y
and (x - y)2 are irrational.

Proof. Let x = p k and y = q m such that k, m, p, q are rational, k, m, m ,

and km are irrational. Since

                                x2     p2k
                                y2 = q2m

x2, y2 are commensurable but x, y are incommensurable and rationally expressible.

Since x2, y2 are commensurable, x2 = qy2 where q is rational. It follows that x2 +
y2 = y2 · (q + 1). Since y is rationally expressible, x2 + y2 is rational.

We claim that x - y and (x - y)2 are irrational.

Notice that

               x2 + y2              p2k + p2m
                                =   
               2xy                  2pq km

             x2 - 2xy + y2          p2k + p2m - 2pqkm
                                =           
               2xy                     2pq km

               (x - y)2             p2k + p2m - 2pqkm
                                =           
               2xy                     2pq km

                                    (                  )

               (x - y)2 =           xy · p2k + p2m - 2pq km

                                               
                                               pq km

Since km is irrational, (x - y)2 is irrational. By [Lemma 10.21.0], x - y is also
irrational, which completes the proof.

Proposition 10.74. FIRST APOTOME OF A MEDIAL NUMBER.
If x = pk1/4 and y = pk3/4 where p is rationally expressible, k1/4, k are irrational,
and k is rational, then x - y, the first apotome of a medial number, is irrational.

Proof. Clearly, x, y are medial numbers. If 0 < k < 1, then x > y. Since xy = k, we
find that x, y are incommensurable but x2, y2 are commensurable. Also, xy = p2k is

rational. By [Def. 10.13], x - y is a first apotome of a medial.
Consider x2 + y2 = p2k · (1 + k). Since p2 · (1 + k) is rational and k is irrational,
x2 + y2 is irrational by [Lemma 10.10.1]. Since 2xy is rational, x2 + y2 and 2xy are

incommensurable. That is

                                     x2 + y2                                   =  t

                                        2xy                                       1

where t is irrational. It follows that

                             x2 - 2xy + y2                                     =     t-1

                                     2xy                                             1

The RHS remains irrational, and so (x - y)2 and 2xy are incommensurable. Since
2xy is rational, (x - y)2 is irrational. By [Lemma 10.21.0], x - y is irrational, which

completes the proof.

Proposition 10.75. SECOND APOTOME OF A MEDIAL NUMBER.

If

                                                x = pk1/4

                                                            
                                                           pm
                                                 y = k1/4
where p is rationally expressible, k1/4, k, m, km are irrational, mk = s2 r2 for nat-
ural numbers r, s, and k, m are rational, then x - y, the second apotome of a medial
number, is irrational.

Proof.  Clearly,  x, y  are  medial  numbers.   We                             choose   m  such  that  m  >  k.  Since  x  =
                                                                                                                        y
                                                                                                                        
    km , x, y are incommensurable but x2, y2 are commensurable. Finally, xy = p2 m

is a second medial number. By [Def. 10.14], a - b is a second apotome of a medial.

Let  s  be  rationally  expressible  where  su  =  x2                          + y2  and  sv  =  2xy.  Then  su  =  p2 k+p2 m
                                                                                                                        
and sv = 2p2 k m; notice that each are second medial numbers.

Since 2xy = 2p2m and x2 + y2 = p2k+p2m ,

                                                                            k

                                     x2 + y2 k + m
                                               =

                                       2xy 2 km
10.3. BOOK X, PROPOSITIONS 48-84                                    451

Since km is irrational by hypothesis, x2+y2, 2xy are incommensurable. Therefore,
u, v are also incommensurable. Notice that

                u2 (k + m)2
                v2 = 4km

    22                            2 (p2k+p2m)2                2  4
and so u , v are commensurable. Since u = k and v = 4p m are rational,

u, v are rationally expressible. By [10.73], u - v is an apotome number and hence

irrational.

It follows that s · (u - v) = (x - y)2 is irrational, and by [Lemma 10.21.0], x - y is
also irrational.

Proposition 10.76. CONSTRUCTION OF A MINOR NUMBER.

If

                                  

                     p                              k
             x =  · 1+ 
                     2                              1 + k2

                                  

                     p                              k
             y =  · 1- 
                     2                              1 + k2

then x - y is a minor number and is irrational.

Proof. Notice that x, y are constructed using [10.33]. Since

             ( x )2               
                                    1 + k2 + k
                     =
             y                        1 + k2 - k

By the proof of [10.64], x2, y2 are incommensurable. But x2 + y2 = p2, and so x2 + y2
is rational. Finally,

                                  p2             1
             xy = 2 · 1 + k2

and so xy is a second medial number. By [Def. 10.15], x - y is a minor number.
Since x2 + y2 is rational and xy is a second medial number,

                                      (x - y)2 = x2 + y2 - 2xy

where the RHS is irrational, and so (x - y)2 is irrational. By [Lemma 10.21.0], x-y
is irrational, which completes the proof.

Proposition 10.77. CONSTRUCTION OF A WR-MEDIAL.

If
                                                       

                                                   p · 1 + k2 + k
                                        x= 

                                                         2 · (1 + k2)
                                                       
                                                   p · 1 + k2 - k

                                                         2 · (1 + k2)

then x - y is a WR-medial and is irrational.

Proof. Notice that x, y are constructed using [10.34]. Since

     ( x )2                                  
                                               1 + k2 + k
                                        =
     y                                       1 + k2 - k

By the proof of [10.64], x2, y2 are incommensurable. But x2 + y2 = p2 ·  1 1+k2 , and
so x2 + y2 is a second medial number. Finally, since

                                                              p2
                                              2xy = 1 + k2

2xy is rational. By [Def. 10.16], a - b is a WR-medial.

Since x2 + y2 is a second medial and xy is rational, x2 + y2 and 2xy are incommen-
surable. That is

        x2 + y2                              =  t

                                        2xy     1

where t is irrational. It follows that

     x2 - 2xy + y2                           =     t-1

        2xy                                        1

The RHS remains irrational, and so (x - y)2 and 2xy are incommensurable. Since
2xy is rational, (x - y)2 is irrational. By [Lemma 10.21.0], x - y is irrational, which

completes the proof.

Proposition 10.78. CONSTRUCTION OF A WM-MEDIAL.

If

                                  

     x=  pm1/4                      1+  k
          ·                                 1 + k2
             2

                                  

     y=  pm1/4                      1-  k
          ·                                 1 + k2
             2

then x - y is a WM-medial and is irrational.

Proof. Notice that x, y are constructed using [10.34]. Since

     ( x )2                       
                                    1 + k2 + k
              =
     y                            1 + k2 - k

By the proof of [10.64], x2, y2 are incommensurable. Notice that x2 + y2 = p2m

and                               

         2xy = p2 ·                             m
                                              1 + k2

Hence, both x2 + y2 and 2xy are second medial numbers. Finally, notice that

     x2 + y2                        
                                  = 1 + k2
         2xy

and so x2 + y2 and 2xy are incommensurable. By [Def. 10.17], x - y is a WM-medial.
Suppose su = x2 + y2 and sv = 2xy where s is rationally expressible. Then

         u2 = p4m
                      s

         v2 =                     p4m

                                            2
                                  s · (1 + k )

It follows that u, v are rationally expressible and u2, v2 are commensurable. How-
ever,

         v = 1
         u                        1 + k2

and so u, v are incommensurable. By [10.73], u - v is an apotome and irrational.
Since s (u - v) = (x - y)2, we find that (x - y)2 is irrational. By [Lemma 10.21.0],

x - y is irrational, which completes the proof.
454  CHAPTER 10. IRRATIONAL NUMBERS

Proposition 10.79. APOTOMES ARE UNIQUE.

Let x - y be an apotome. If x - y = a - b, then x = a and y = b.

Proof. Suppose x - y = a - b but x > a. Then

                          x-y = a-b
                      (x - y)2 = (a - b)2
               x2 - 2xy + y2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
     (x2 + y2) - (a2 + b2) = 2xy - 2ab

By the proof of [10.73], the LHS is rational. By [10.26], the RHS is irrational, a
contradiction. A similar contradiction follows if we assume x < a. Thus, x = a. The
case of y = b follows mutatis mutandis.

Proposition 10.80. FIRST APOTOMES OF A MEDIAL NUMBER ARE UNIQUE.

Let x - y be a first apotome of a medial number. If x - y = a - b, then x = a and
y = b.

Proof. The proof is similar to [10.79] as is left as an exercise to the reader.

Proposition 10.81. SECOND APOTOMES OF A MEDIAL NUMBER ARE UNIQUE.

Let x - y be a second apotome of a medial number. If x - y = a - b, then x = a and
y = b.

Proof. Our hypothesis and claim are stated above. Suppose x - y = a - b but x > a.
Let su = x2 + y2, sv = 2xy, su = a2 + b2, and sv = 2ab.
By [10.75], u, v are incommensurable and rationally expressible but u2, v2 are com-
mensurable. By [10.73], u - v is an apotome number.
Similarly, u - v is an apotome number such that u - v = u - v. By [10.79], u = u
and v = v; this contradicts our hypothesis that x > a.
A similar contradiction occurs if we assume x < a. Thus, x = a, and so y = b.

Let p be rationally expressible and a > b. Then n = a - b is a first apotome number
when a and p are commensurable and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is commensurable with

Proof. Construct kp such that k is rational (and so p, kp are commensurable). Also
construct m2, n2 such that m, n are natural numbers but m2 - n2 = d2 for any
natural d. Let

Clearly, a, b are incommensurable and rationally expressible while a2, b2 are com-
mensurable. By [10.73], a - b is an apotome number.

Notice that a, p are commensurable by hypothesis.

and so a, h are commensurable. This completes the construction.

Proposition 10.86. CONSTRUCTION OF A SECOND APOTOME.

Let p be rationally expressible and a > b. Then n = a - b is a second apotome when
b and p are commensurable, and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is commensurable with a.

Proof. Let p be rationally expressible and a > b. Construct kp such that k is rational
(and so p, kp are commensurable). Also construct m2, n2 such that m, n are natural
numbers but m2 - n2 = d2 for any natural d. Let

where    c  =   nm .  We   claim    that  n  =  a-b     is  a  first  apotome  number  where  a  =   kp
                                                                                                      1-c2

and b = kp.

Clearly, a, b are incommensurable and rationally expressible but a2, b2 are commen-
surable. By [10.73], a - b is an apotome number.

Notice that b, p are commensurable by hypothesis.

Let  h2  =  a2  -  b2.  Then  h  =        -  b2.  Notice  that

and so a, h are commensurable. This completes the construction.

Proposition 10.87. CONSTRUCTION OF A THIRD APOTOME.

Let p be rationally expressible and a > b. Then n = a - b is a third apotome when
both a and b are incommensurable with p, and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is commensu-
rable with a.

Proof. Construct qm2 and q · (m2 - n2) such that, if divided, neither p, qm2, nor
q · (m2 - n2) have a ratio which equals s2 r2 where r, s are natural numbers. Let

and

We claim that n = a - b is a third apotome number where a = m · pq and b =


  m qa·(m2-n2) .
Clearly, a, b are incommensurable and rationally expressible but a2, b2 are commen-
surable. By [10.73], a - b is an apotome number.

Also notice that a, p and b, p are incommensurable.

Let p be rationally expressible and a > b. Then n = a - b is a fourth apotome when
a and p are commensurable, and a2 = b2 + h2 where h is incommensurable with a.

Proof. Construct kp such that k is rational (and so p, kp are commensurable). Also
construct m, n such that neither m, n, nor m + n have a ratio which equals s2 r2 where
r, s are natural numbers. Let

where c, k  is rational.      Then u      =   kp   · (1 - c) and v  =  kp  · (1 + c).  Let a2  =  pu and

b2 = pv; we claim that a - b = pn is an apotome number.

Since uv = 41 · k2p2 · (1 - c2),

and  so  ab  =     1 kp21    -  c2.    It  follows   that

                                (a - b)2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab

                                             = kp2 - kp2 1 - c2

It follows that a - b = np.

Notice that a2 = 2 kp2 · (1 - c) and b2 = 2 kp2 · (1 + c) are rational, and so a, b are ratio-
nally expressible. Clearly, a2, b2 are commensurable but a, b are incommensurable.

By [10.73], a - b is an apotome. Therefore,

Proposition 10.92. ROOT OF A SECOND APOTOME.
Given a rationally expressible p and second apotome

                                             n =  kp - kp
                                                      1 - c2

pn is a first apotome of a medial.

Proof. Let

                                                  u + v =  kp
                                                                    1 - c2

where    c, k  is  rational.    Then       u   =  kp·(1+c)           and    v  =  kp·(1-c)  Let  a2  =  pu  and  b2  =  pv;
                                                    
                                                                                    2.
                                                                  2
                       2· 1-c 2· 1-c
we claim that pn = a - b is a first apotome of a medial.

Since  uv  =    1  ·  k2p2,
                4

                                                    u = 21 kp
                                                   12 kp v
                                                   a2 1 = 2 kp2

and so ab = 12 kp2. It follows that

                            (a - b)2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab

                                        = p · (u + v) - 1 kp2

                                                        1 - c2

and so a - b = np.
By the above, a, b are medial numbers where a, b are incommensurable but a2, b2
are commensurable. Also notice that

                                                       
                                        ab = p · uv

                                                  kp2
                                             =

                                                    2

and so ab is rational. By [Def. 10.11], a - b is a first apotome of a medial. This
completes the construction.

Remark. We may also write the above as

                            (                )1/2       (               )1/2

which is a root of the equation

pn is a second apotome of a medial.

Proof. Let

where  c, k  is  rational.  Then  u  =    2  · (1 + c)  and  v  =    2  · (1 - c).  Let  a2  =  pu  and
b2 = pv. We claim that a - b = pn is a second apotome of a medial.

Since ab  =  1  ·   kp2     ab is a second medial number.        Finally,  a2 + b2  =  kp2,  and so

                               = p · kp · 1 + c - kp

and so (a - b)2 = np, or a - b = np.

Since u, v are incommensurable, a2, b2 are incommensurable. By [Lemma 10.21.0],
a, b are incommensurable. Since a2 + b2 = kp2 · 1 + c, a2 + b2 is a second medial
number. Finally, 2ab = kp2 is rational. By [Def. 10.14], a - b is a WR-medial.

Given a rationally expressible p and sixth apotome
                                                      

                                              n=p k-p m

2 · k + k - m and v = 2 · k - k - m . Let a = pu and b = pv. We claim22

that a - b = np is a WM-medial.

Since uv = 14 mp2,

                            u 21 · pm
                        21 · pm = v

                           a 2 2 1 · p2m
                       21 · p2m = b2

and so ab = 21 · p2m. It follows that

(a - b)2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab

                    = p2 ( · k +  ) k - m + p2 ( · k -  ) k - m - p2m
                    2                        2

                    = p2k - p2m
                             (  )

                    = p· p k-p m

and so (a - b)2 = np. It follows that a - b = np.

Since u > v, a > b. Since u, v are incommensurable, a2, b2 are incommensurable. By
[Lemma 10.21.0], a, b are incommensurable. Since a2 +b2 = p2k, a2 +b2 is a second
medial number. Similarly, 2ab = p2m is also a second medial number. Finally,

                                 a2 + b2       k

                                 2ab      =    m

By hypothesis, a2 + b2 and 2ab are incommensurable. By [Def. 10.15], a - b is a
WM-medial.

Proof. Let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = p2, sy = kp2, 2sz = 2p2k where


  k is irrational but k is rational. Hence

                                                           (  )2

                                       (x + y) - 2z = s

We claim that (x + y) - 2z is a first apotome.
Notice that (x + y)2 = s2 p4·(1+k)2 , and so x + y is rationally expressible. Since 4z2 =
s2 4p4k , 2z is also rationally expressible. Also

                                    x + y (1 + k)
                                                 =
                                    2z              2k

Hence, x + y and 2z are incommensurable while (x + y)2 and (2z)2 are commensu-
rable. By [Def. 10.11], (x + y) - 2z is an apotome.

Since s x+y = s2 p2·(1+k) , x + y and s are commensurable.
                  

Suppose h = (x + y)2 - (2z)2. Then (x + y)2 = (2z)2 + h2. Notice that

                                 2  2               p4 · (1 + k)2 - 4p4k
         (x + y) - (2z) = s2

                                              p4 · (k - 1)2
                                         = s2

and so h = s p2·(k-1) . Then

                                    x+y          =  k+1

                                    h               k-1

and so x + y and h are commensurable. By [Def. 10.10], (x + y) - 2z is a first
apotome.

Proof. Let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = p2k, sy = p2k3/2, and 2sz = 2p2k
         

where k is irrational but k is rational and p is rationally expressible. Hence

                                    (x + y) - 2z = s

We claim that (x + y) - 2z is a second apotome.

Notice that (x + y)2 = s2 p4k·(k+1)2 and (2z)2 = s2 4k2p4 ; it follows that x + y and 2z are
rationally expressible. Also

                                                x+y k+1

and so x + y, 2z are incommensurable but (x + y)2, (2z)2 are commensurable. By
[Def. 10.11], (x + y) - 2z is an apotome.

Notice that s2z = s2 2p2k and so 2z and s are commensurable.
                  

Suppose h = (x + y)2 - (2z)2. Then (x + y)2 = (2z)2 + h2. Notice that

         (x + y) - (2z) = s2

                                                     s

is a third apotome.

Proof. Let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = p2k, sy = p2 · m , and 2sz =
2p2m where  k k is irrational but k is rational and p is rationally expressible.

Hence                                                (             )2

                                  (x + y) - 2z = s

We claim that (x + y) - 2z is a third apotome.
Notice that (x + y)2 = ks2 p4·(k+m)2 and (2z)2 = s2 4mp4 ; it follows that x + y and 2z are
rationally expressible. Also

                                               x+y k+m

                                                 2z 2 km

and so x + y, 2z are incommensurable but (x + y)2, (2z)2 are commensurable. By

[Def. 10.11], (x + y) - 2z is an apotome.

Notice that

                                    x+y              p2 · (k + m)
                                         =

and so x + y and 2z are each incommensurable with s.
                  

Suppose h = (x + y)2 - (2z)2. Then (x + y)2 = (2z)2 + h2. Notice that

If s is rationally expressible and p2 · 1 +  k 1+k2 - p2 · 1 -  k 1+k2 is a minor

                                      s

is a fourth apotome.

Proof. Let

                                      

                                   p                               k

                                   p                               k
                              v =  · 1-

Also let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = u2, sy = v2, and 2sz = 2uv where k
is irrational but k is rational and p is rationally expressible.

Hence                                                  (u - v)2
                                   (x + y) - 2z = s

We claim that (x + y) - 2z is a fourth apotome.

Notice that (x + y)2 = s2 p4 and (2z)2 = s2·(1+k2) p4 ; it follows that x + y and 2z are

rationally expressible. Also       ( x + y 2 )2

and so (x + y)2, (2z)2 are commensurable but x + y, 2z are incommensurable. By

[Def. 10.11], (x + y) - 2z is an apotome.

Notice that s x+y = s2 p2 , and so x + y and s are commensurable.
                  

Suppose h = (x + y)2 - (2z)2. Then (x + y)2 = (2z)2 + h2. Notice that

Proof. Let

                                2 (1 + k2)       · 1 + k2 - k

Also let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = u2, sy = v2, and 2sz = 2uv where k
is irrational but k is rational and p is rationally expressible. Hence

                                                 (u - v)2
                             (x + y) - 2z = s

We claim that (x + y) - 2z is a fifth apotome.

Notice that (x + y)2 = s2·(1+k2) p4 and (2z)2 = s2·(1+k2)2 p4 ; it follows that x + y and 2z
are rationally expressible. Also

                                            ( x + y 2 )2

and so (x + y)2, (2z)2 are commensurable but x + y, 2z are incommensurable. By

Notice that s2z = s2·(1+k2) p2 , and so 2z and s are commensurable.

Also let x, y, z be real numbers such that sx = u2, sy = v2, and 2sz = 2uv where k
is irrational but k is rational and p is rationally expressible. Hence

We claim that (x + y) - 2z is a sixth apotome.

Notice that (x + y)2 = s2 mp4 and (2z)2 = s2·(1+k2)2 mp4 ; it follows that x + y and 2z are

rationally expressible. Also        ( x + y 2 )2

and so (x + y)2, (2z)2 are commensurable but x + y, 2z are incommensurable. By

[Def. 10.11], (x + y) - 2z is an apotome.
Notice that s x+y = s2 p2 · m and s2z = s2·(1+k2) p2 · m, and so both x + y and 2z are
incommensurable with s.

Suppose a = x - y is an apotome number where a is a first, second, third, fourth,
fifth, or sixth apotome number. Also suppose that a and c are commensurable. We
claim that c is an apotome number of the same type as a.

Proof. Since a, c are commensurable, c = qa where q is rational. If a contains the
rationally expressible term p, then qp is rationally expressible. Since q has no other
effect on the remaining terms, c is an apotome of the same type as a.

If kp2 is rational and p2m is a second medial number, then

is either an apotome or a minor number.

Proof. Suppose k, m are rational and p is rationally expressible. Also suppose that
su = kp2 and sv = p2m. It follows that su is rational and sv is a second medial
number. Notice that s · (u - v) = kp2 - p2m. Also

If kp2 is rational and p2m is a second medial number, then

Proof. Suppose k, m are rational and p is rationally expressible. Also suppose that

Proposition 10.111. BINOMIAL NUMBERS ARE DISTINCT FROM APOTOMES.

Proof. Let p + pk be a binomial number and s - sm be an apotome where p, s are
rationally expressible, k, m are irrational, and k, m are rational. We claim that
p + pk = s - sm.

Assume instead that

                                  (  )2           (  )2
                                     p+p k = s-s m

                          p2 · 1 + 2 k + k = s (  ) 2 · (1 - 2m + m)

                    p2 · (1 + k) - s2 · (1 + m) = - s ( 2 · 2m + p2 · 2k)

                    s2 · (1 + m) - p2 · (1 + k) = s2 · 2m + p2 · 2k

Clearly, the LHS is rational. If we square both sides, the RHS becomes
                                      s2 · 4m + 8ps · km + p2 · 4k

and must be rational for all choices of k, m. But k, m may be chosen arbitrarily, a
                                         
contradiction. Thus, p + p k = s - s m.

Proposition 10.115. A PROOF OF INFINITE IRRATIONALS.

Let pk1/4 be a medial number and s be a rationally expressible. Infinitely many
irrational numbers may be constructed from pk1/4 and s.

Proof. Clearly, pk1/4 is irrational. Notice that

                          pk1/4              =  x

                                       x        s

                                       x2 = spk1/4
                                                (     )1/2
                                          x = spk1/4

Suppose spk1/4 is rational. Then s2p2k is rational and also irrational by [Lemma
                 
10.10.1]  since    k  is  irrational.  This  contradiction  demonstrates  that  spk1/4  is  irra-

tional. By [Lemma 10.21.0], x is also irrational.
Suppose we find that (spk1/4)1/2k is rational for some natural number k. By ap-

plying [Lemma 10.10.0] a finite number of times, we find that spk1/4 is rational, a

contradiction. This completes the proof.

1. If the segments AF and BF are constructed, prove that the figure ACBF is a
rhombus.

                                         Figure 14.1.1: [1.1, #1]

Proof. Construct AF and BF . By an argument similar to the proof of [1.1], AB =
AF = BF . Since AC = AB = BC from [1.1],

                                          AC = BC = BF = AF
and so ACBF is equilateral.
By [1.8], ABC = ABF and since each are equilateral, CAB = F BA. By [Cor.
1.29.1], AC  BF . Similarly, AF  BC, and so ACBF is a parallelogram. Since it is
also equilateral, by [Def 1.29] ACBF is a rhombus.

2. If CF is constructed and AB is extended to the circumferences of the circles (at
points D and E), prove that the triangles CDF and CEF are equilateral.

                        
Proof. Construct CF , and extend AB to AB where AB intersects A at D and B

at E. Finally, construct CDF and CEF . We wish to show that CDF and

CEF are equilateral.

                                         Figure 14.1.2: [1.1, #2]

By [1.1], ABC is equilateral. By the proof of [1.1, #1]1, AF B is also equilateral.
Since AC = AF , by [1.8] ABC = AF B. Since AB is a radius of A and B, it
follows that the radii of A are equal in length to radii of B, and so

                            AB = AC = AD = AF = BC = BE = BF

Since ABC is equilateral, BAC = ABC. Since DE is a segment, BAC +
CAD = two right angles = ABC + CBE. It follows that CAD = CBE.
Similarly, we can show that F AD = F BE.

    1Notice that it is permissible and encouraged to cite the results of previous exercises. This is the
opposite of most K-12 math courses, where students can be punished for treating problems as parts
of an interconnected whole. Students should unlearn this "lesson" as soon as possible; math and the
sciences are not about isolated pieces, but connections.

   What is not permissible is circular reasoning: to cite the result of problem #1 in the proof of problem
#2 and also cite the result of problem #2 in the proof of problem #1.

   That said, some problems in this chapter will be solved without referring to previous solutions if only
to prevent this document from becoming more frustrating than it already is.

                                         Figure 14.1.3: [1.1, #2]

Since ABC = AF B, BAC = BAF , and so DAF = CAD. That is,

                                F AD = F BE = DAC = EBC

Consider ADC, ADF : AF = AD = AC by the above and F AD = DAC. By
[1.4], ADC = ADF .

Consider ADC, BEC: AC = AD = BC = BE by the above and CAD =
CBE. By [1.4], ADC = BEC.
Similarly, we can show that BEC = BEF , and so

                               ADC = ADF = BEF = BEC

Hence, DF = DC = CE = EF .

By [1.32], the sum of the three interior angles of a triangle equals two right angles.
To make our calculation easier, define the measure of two right angles to equal 
radians.

Let  = each interior angle of ABC. By [1.5.1], ABC is equiangular, and so
3 = , or  = /3.

By [1.13], CAL + CAD = . Since CAL = /3, CAD = 2/3. Similarly,
F AL = /3.
Consider CAF , CAD: AD = AC = AF since each are radii of A, CAD =
2/3, and CAF = CAL + F AL = 2/3. By [1.4], CAF = CAD, and so
CD = CF.
Hence, CD = CF = DF , or CDF is equilateral. By the above and [1.8], CDF =
CEF , which completes the proof.

1. Prove [1.2] when A is a point on BC.
Given a point on an arbitrary segment, it is possible to construct a segment with:

   (1) one endpoint being the previously given point
   (2) its length is equal to that of the arbitrary segment.

Proof. Let BC be an arbitrary segment where A is a point on BC. We claim that
we can construct a segment with A as an endpoint such that its length is equal to
that of BC.

If A = B or A = C, the proof is trivial.2

Suppose that A is not an endpoint of BC. Construct the equilateral triangle ABD

[1.1]. Also construct the circle A with radius equal in length to AC. Extend side
     --  --
DA to DA where DA intersects A at E.

                                                                                               --
Construct the equilateral triangle EGH where G is also a point on DA and EG =
AD [1.2]. So AE  EG = AG and

                                            AG = AE + EG
                                                    = AC + AD
                                                    = AC + AB
                                                    = BC

which completes the proof.

    2A trivial proof is one that is immediately obvious. In this case, if A = B or A = C, then BC itself
is the segment we require. Since it already exists, there is nothing to do but acknowledge that the proof
took no effort on our part, i.e., it is trivial.

Prove the following:

1. The line that bisects the vertical angle of an isosceles triangle also bisects the
base perpendicularly.

Proof. Suppose ABC is an isosceles triangle where AB = AC. Further suppose
that the ray AD bisects BAC.3 We claim that BD = CD and AD  BC.

                                         Figure 14.1.5: [1.4, #1]

Consider ABD, ACD: the triangles share side AD, and by hypothesis AB = AC
and DAB = DAC. By [1.4], ABD = ACD. Hence, BD = CD. Also, ADB =
ADC; since they are supplements, they stand at right angles [Def. 1.14], and so,
AD  BC.

2. If two adjacent sides of a quadrilateral are equal in length and the diagonal
bisects the angle between them, then their remaining sides are also equal in length.

Proof. Suppose that ABCD is a quadrilateral where AB = AC and where the di-
agonal AD bisects BAC. We claim that BD = CD.
Consider ACD, ABD: since AC = AB, each shares side AD, and DAC =
DAB by hypothesis, by [1.4] ACD = ABD. Therefore, BD = CD.

Construct CEF and DEF . Since AB  CD and AB and CD bisect each other
at E by hypothesis, CEF = DEF and CE = DE. Since CEF and DEF
share side F E, by [1.4] we find that CEF = DEF Hence, CF = DF .
The proof for any point on CD is similar to the above, mutatis mutandis. Therefore,
we have proven our claim.

Proof. Construct the figure from [1.5], construct AH, and let I be the intersection
  
of BC and AH. We claim that AH is the Axis of Symmetry of ABC.

                                         Figure 14.1.8: [1.5, #2]

Consider BHF and CHG: by the proof of [1.5] BF H = CGH and BF = CG.
By [1.15] BHF = CHG, and so by [1.26], BHF = CHG. It follows that
BH = CH.

Consider ABH and ACH: by the above, BH = CH; by the proof of [1.5] AB =
AC; finally, the triangles share side AH. By [1.8], ABH = ACH. It follows that
BAH = CAH.

Consider ABI and ACI: by the above BAI = CAI, AB = AC, and the
triangles share side AI. By [1.4], ABI = ACI. It follows that ABI = ACI.

                                                              
Since ABC = ABI  ACI, we find that AH is the Axis of Symmetry of ABC

4. Take the midpoint on each side of an equilateral triangle; the segments joining
them form a second equilateral triangle.

Proof. Suppose that ABC is equilateral. Construct the midpoints I, J, and K on
sides BC, AB, and AC, respectively. We claim that IJK is equilateral.

                                         Figure 14.1.9: [1.5, #4]

Since I is the midpoint of side BC, IB = IC. Similarly, JA = JB. Since ABC is
equilateral, IB = JB. Continuing in this way, we can show that

                                  IB = JB = JA = AK = KC = IC

And by [1.5, Cor. 1] we also have that
                                       ABC = ACB = BAC

Hence by multiple applications of [1.4],
                                       JBI = KCI = JAK

It follows that IJ = JK = KI, and so IJK is equilateral. This proves our claim.

Proof. Consider ADH, AEH: by construction in [1.9], DAH = EAH and
AD = AE, and each triangle shares side AH. By [1.4], ADH = AEH. It follows
that DH = HE. Also, DHA = EHA. Since these are adjacent angles, they are

AF  DE, which concludes the proof.

By the proof of [1.10], ACB is isosceles. By [Cor. 1.9.1], CD is an Axis of Sym-

vertices A, B, and E, where E is any point on CD except D itself. Hence, AE = EB

                          
for any point E on CD. Since AD = DB by [1.10], we have proven that every point

    
on CD is equally distant from A and B.

                                                                                      
Suppose point K exists where AK = BK but K is not on CD. It follows that
ABE is distinct from ABK where the triangles share side AB, AE = AK, and
BE = BK. But this construction contradicts [1.7]. Hence, no such K exists, which

Proof. Construct the figure from [1.11], and also construct the equilateral triangle

DF E is equilateral. By [1.8], DF E = DGE.

Construct GC; by the proof of [1.11], GC  AB. We claim that F EGD is a rhom-

Consider DCF and DCG: since DEF = DEG, DF = DG and CDG =
CDF ; the triangles also share side DC. By [1.4], DCF = DCG. Similarly, we
can show that ECF = ECG.
By the proof to [1.11], DCF = ECF . By the above, it can be shown that

                               DCF = DCG = ECF = ECG

Hence, F D = F E = GD = GE, and so F EGD is a equilateral.

Since DGF = EF G by the above, DG  EF ; since EGF = DF G, EG 
F D. Hence, F EGD is an equilateral parallelogram. By [Def. 1.29], F EGD is a
rhombus. Clearly, DE and GF are the diagonals of F EGD.
By the above, DC = CE and F C = CG, so the diagonals of F EGD bisect each
other. By [1.11], DCF is a right angle, and so DE  GF , which completes the
proof.

1. Prove that circle  C cannot intersect AB at more than two points.

                                        Figure 14.1.15: [1.12, #1]

                                          
Proof. Suppose C intersects AB at more than two points. If the third point lies
between points F and G, then the radius of C must decrease in length; this con-
tradicts the definition of a radius (that it must have a fixed length).
Similarly, if the third point lies to the left of F or to the right of G, the radius of C
must increase in length, resulting in a similar contradiction.

                                       
Hence, C cannot intersect AB at more than two points.

3. Prove that three equal and distinct segments cannot be constructed from the
same point to the same line.

Proof. Suppose such a construction were possible. Consider the common point to
be the center of a circle and the three equal yet distinct segments to be radii of
that circle. Then we could construct a line such that the circumference of the circle
intersects the line at three points. This contradicts [1.12, #1], which completes the
proof.

5. If ABC is a triangle such that AB  AC, then a segment AG, constructed from
A to any point G on side BC, is less than AC.

Proof. Construct ABC where AB < AC. Construct AG where G is a point on side
BC (other than B and C). We claim that AG < AC.

                                        Figure 14.1.16: [1.19, #5]

If AB = AC, then by [1.19, #3], AG < AC.
If AB < AC, extend AB to AH such that AH = AC and construct CH. Extend AG
to AJ where J is on CH. Clearly, AG  AJ.
Since AH = AC, by [1.19, #3], AJ < AC. Since AG  AJ, AG < AC, which
completes the proof.

                         Figure 14.1.17: [1.20, #5]

By [1.20], we have

Consider ABE: by [1.20], we have
                                              AE + AB > BE

Similarly, in DBC, we have

and in ACF , we have

Recall that AE = 12 AC, BD = 12 AB, and CF = 12 BC. Adding each inequality, we
find that

                     AB + BC + AC + AE + BD + CF > AF + BE + CD

BCD. Prove that DH = DJ.

Proof. Our hypothesis and claim are stated above. Construct the above as well as
                                  
JK and HL such that JK  CD and CD  HL. By [1.30], JK  HL.

Since CH is a bisector of BCD, BCH = DCH. Since CD  HL, DCH =
                          

CHL. And since AB  EF , BCH = DHC. This gives us
                                BCH = DCH = DHC = CHL

Consider CDH. Since DCH = DHC, by [1.6] DC = DH.
Similarly, it can be shown that

                                 JCD = JCK = DJC = DCJ

and so DJ = DC.
Thus, DJ = DH, which completes the proof.

Consider GLI and GM K: LGI = M GK by [1.15]; GL = GM by construction;
GM K = GLI by construction. By [1.26], GLI = GM K, and so GI = GK.
Now consider GHI and GJK: by the above, GI = GK. HGI = JGK by

that GHI = GJK. Therefore, HI = JK, which proves our claim.

5. Prove that the three altitudes of a triangle are concurrent. [Note: We are proving
the existence of the orthocenter of a triangle: the point where the three altitudes
intersect, and one of a triangle's points of concurrency.]

Proof. Construct the following: ABC, altitudes AG and CF , and also BD where
D is the intersection of AG and CF . Extend BD to BE where E is a point on AC.
We claim that BE is an altitude of ABC.

                                        Figure 14.1.24: [1.32, #5]

By the construction of BDA, we have EDB = BDA+EDA. Consider AED:
by [1.32] BDA = DEA + EAD. Applying [1.32] again, we obtain

                              EDB = BDA + EDA
                                           = DEA + EAD + EDA
                                           =  radians

since DEA, EAD, and EDA are the interior angles of EDA. Hence, BE =
BD  DE. It remains to be shown that BEA is a right angle.
Suppose BEA < BEC. It follows that AC is not a straight segment, which
contradicts its construction as a side of ABC. We obtain a similar result if
BEA > BEC. Hence, BEA = BEC. Since the angles are adjacent, each
are right angles.

Thus, EB is an altitude of ABC, and the three altitudes of ABC are concurrent.
This completes the proof.

By [Cor. 1.29.1], DCB = CBA. By hypothesis, CBA = CBD, and so
DCB = CBD. We may continue this line of reasoning until we obtain

Consider CED, CEA: ECD = ECA (since DCB = ACB), EDC =

By [1.34], AC = BD and AB = CD. By [1.34, #1], E bisects both AD and BC. Since
AD = BC by hypothesis,

                                         AE = ED = CE = EB

By [1.32, #6], CED  =  DEB  =  BEA  =  AEC  =         radians in measure.  By

[1.4],

                    ECD = EDB = EBA = EAC

and so

                       AB = BD = DC = CA

Consider ACD, BAC: AD = BC by hypothesis and their sides are equal by
the above. By [1.8], ACD = BAC. It follows that ACD = BAC. By [1.34],
ACD = ABD. Clearly,

                                ACD = ABD = BAC = BDC

By [1.29], we find that the sum of the interior angles of ABCD = 2 radians (four
right angles). Since each angle equals ACD in measure, ACD = /2 radians;
or, each interior angle of ABCD is a right angle, which completes the proof.

1. Triangles with equal bases and altitudes are equal in area.

Proof. Suppose we have two triangles with equal bases and with equal altitudes.
Since the altitude of a triangle is the distance between the parallels which contain

Since ADE = BDF , F B = AE. Because AE = EC by construction, F B = EC.

                               AEF = ECD = F DB = DF E

                                        Figure 14.1.34: [1.40, #4]

By [1.40, #2], we find that DE  AB, DF  AC, and EF  BC. By [1.29, Cor. 1], we
find that:

                                EDC = EF A = DBF = DEF
                                CED = EAF = DF B = EDF
                                ECD = AEF = F DB = EF D

Since EF CD is a parallelogram, EF = CD. Since EF BD is a parallelogram,
EF = BD, and so

                                              EF = CD = DB

By multiple applications of [1.26],
                                AEF = DEF = ECD = DBF

which proves our claim.

1. Two squares have equal side-lengths if and only if the squares are equal in area.

                           Figure 14.1.35: [1.46, #1]

Proof. Construct squares ABCD and EF GH as well as BD and F H.

Claim 1: If AB = EF , then ABCD = EF GH.

Consider ADB, EHF : AB = EF = AD = EH and DAB = HEF (since each
are right angles). By [1.4], ABD = EF H. It follows that ABD = EF H.

By [1.41], ABCD = 12 ABD and EF GH = 12 EF H. By the above, we obtain
ABCD = EF GH, which proves our claim.

Claim 2: If ABCD = EF GH, then AB = EF .

By [1.41], ABCD = 12 ABD and EF GH = 12 EF H, and so ABD = EF H.

Let b1 equal the base of ABD, h1 equal the altitude of ABD, b2 equal the base

of EF H, and h2 equal the altitude of EF H. Since the area of a triangle = 12 bh,

we have                         1         1

                                2 b1h1 = 2 b2h2

Since  AB C D  and  EF GH  are  squares,  b1  =  h1  and  b2  =  h2.  Hence,  b2  =  b22,  or

AB = EF . It follows that AB = EF , which completes the proof.

Recall that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is  radians in measure.

Consider   AB C :  notice  that  if  AC B  =     radians  and  BAC      =    radians,  then
                                              2

ABC  =        -  radians.  Since  K AC  =  GAB     =      radians  and

                 KAG + KAC + BAC + GAB = 2 radians

it follows that, in radians:

                   KAG = 2 - KAC - BAC - GAB

Recall that the general form of the equation of the area of a triangle is:
                                             Area = 1 xy · sin 
                                                        2

where  is the interior angle to sides x and y. So

            Area KAG  =        1  AK  ·     AG     ·  sin(K AG)
                               2

                      =        1  AC  ·  AB        ·  sin(  -   )
                               2

                      =        1  AC  ·  AB        ·  sin()
                               2

by the properties of the sine function. We also have

            Area ABC  =        1  AB  ·  AC        ·  sin(B AC )
                               2

                      =        1  AC  ·  AB        ·  sin()
                               2

                      = Area KAG

Similarly,

            Area BEF = 12 BE · BF · sin(F BE)

                      = 12 BC · AB · sin( 2 + )

                      =        1  BC  ·  AB        ·  cos()
                               2

and

            Area ABC = 12 AB · BC · sin( 2 - )

                      =        1  BC     ·  AB        ·  cos()
                               2

                      = Area BEF

Therefore KAG = ABC = BEF which proves our claim.

Since DF  BC, by [1.41], ABC = 2 · AF CB. Also by [1.41], AF C = 2 ·

Also by [1.41], since EF  AB, ABC = BEC, or

Since DEF = ABC  ACF  ABD  BEC, the proof is complete.

Consider DF A and DEA: AF = AE, DAF = DAE by construction, and the

Since ADE = DAF , by [Cor. 1.29.1], F A  DE. Similarly, we can show that
F D  AE.

By [Def. 1.29], AEDF is a rhombus. Since AEDF is inscribed in ABC and
ABC shares BAC with AEDF , our proof is complete.

Construct rectangle DCHG where BD = DG. (Note: geometrically, we claim that

                                   = (DB)2 + 2 · DB · DC + (DC)2

Hence,

        (AD)2 + (DC)2 + (AD)2 + (DB)2 = (AB)2 + (AC)2
                2 · (AD)2 + (DC)2 + (DB)2 = (DB)2 + 2 · DB · DC + (DC)2

4. Suppose two circles touch externally. If two diameters in these circles are par-
allel, the line from the point of intersection to the endpoint of one diameter passes
through the endpoint of the other.

Proof. Suppose A and C touch at point B. By [3.13], these circles touch only at
B. Construct AC, and construct diameters DE and F G such that DE  F G and

Suppose that DB does not intersect G. Extend F G to F G and suppose that DB
     
intersects F G at H.

Consider ABD and CBH: by hypothesis, DAB = HCB; by [1.15], ABD =
CBH; applying [1.32], we obtain ADB = CHB. That is, ABD and CBH
are equiangular.

However, ABD is an isosceles triangle and CBH is not since BC = CG and
CG < CH; hence, the triangles are not equiangular, a contradiction.

                                                                             
An equivalent contradiction is obtained if DB intersects F G at any point other than
G, mutatis mutandis. This proves our claim.

1. If two circles are concentric, all chords of the larger circle which touch the smaller
circle are equal in length.

Proof. Construct A1 with radius AB and A2 with radius AC. On A2, construct
chord DE such that DE touches A1 at B. Also on A2, construct chord HJ such
that HJ touches A1 at G. We claim that DE = HJ.

                                        Figure 14.3.5: [3.16, #1]

Notice that AG = AB since each are radii of A1. By [3.16], DE and HJ have no
other points of intersection with A1. Hence, DE and HJ are equal distance from
A, the center of A2. By [3.14], DE = HJ. This proves our claim.

1. Suppose that ABCD is a semicircle with diameter AD and a chord BC. Extend
     --           --
BC to BC and AD to AD, and suppose each ray intersects at E. Prove that if CE

is equal in length to the radius of ABCD, then arc AB = 3 · CD.

Proof. Our hypothesis and claim are stated above.

                        Figure 14.3.6: [3.30, #1]

Construct CD, CF , F B, and AB. Notice that
                                     CE = DF = CF = BF = AF

By [1.5], we find that CEF = CF E, F CB = F BC, and F BA = F AB.

Define CEF = a, ECF = b, F CB = c, CF B = d, F BA = e, and BF A = f .
Using linear algebra, we obtain:

                                                   b + c = 180
                                                 2a + b = 180
                                                 2c + d = 180
                                                 2e + f = 180
                                             a + d + f = 180
                                            a + c + 2e = 180

where the RHS is in degrees. In matrix form:

In reduced row echelon form, this becomes:

  0 0 0 0 0 1 60

Or, CEF = 20, ECF = 140, F CB = 40, CF B = 100, F BA = 60, and
BF A = 60.

Since CEF is isosceles, CF D = CF E = 20, and so BF A = 3 · CF D = 60.
By [7.29, Cor. 1], it follows that AB = 3 · CD.

Figure 14.4.1: [4.4, #1]

1. In [4.4]: if OC is constructed, prove that the angle ACB is bisected. Hence, we
prove the existence of the incenter of a triangle.

Proof. Consider OF C and CDO: by the proof of [4.4], OF C = CDO since
each are right angles. By [1.47],

( )2 ( )2                         ( )2
OF + F C = OC

( )2 ( )2                         ( )2
OD + DC = OC

Since OF = OD (each are radii of  O), F C = DC. By [1.8], OF C = CDO, and
so OCF = OCD.

It follows that OC bisects ACB, and therefore O is the incenter of ABC; that
is, O is the point of intersection of the bisectors of the three internal angles of

AB C .

1. Prove that the three altitudes of a triangle (ABC) are concurrent. (This proves
the existence of the orthocenter of a triangle.)

Proof. Construct ABC; also construct altitudes AE, BD, and CF . We wish to
show these altitudes are concurrent.

                  Figure 14.4.2: [4.5, #1]

                                            
Through vertex A, construct QR such that QR  BC. Similarly, construct P Q  AB

through C and P R  AC through B. Notice that the segments QR, P Q, and P R

constitute P QR.

We have also constructed RACB, QABC, and P BAC. It follows that AR = BC
and AQ = BC, or AR = AQ. Hence, A is the midpoint QR; similarly, B is the

midpoint P R and C is the midpoint of P Q.

Since AE  BC and BC  QR, AE  QR; or, AE is the perpendicular bisector of
QR. Similarly, BD is the perpendicular bisector of RP , and CF is the perpendicular
bisector of P Q. All are concurrent at the circumcenter of P RQ by [4.5].

Since these segments are also the altitudes of ABC, the proof is complete.

                                            Figure 14.4.3: [4.7]

Proof. Consider BF CO: by [1.34], BC bisects BF CO, and so BF CO = 2 ·
OB C .

Consider OBA and ODC: AOB = DOC by [1.15] and the adjacent sides to
these angles are equal since they are radii of O. By [1.4], OBA = ODC.

Consider OBA and OBC: AOB = COB since AC is a segment and the
adjacent sides to these angles are equal since each are radii of O. Again by [1.4],
OBA = OBC. It follows that OBA = OBC = ODC = OAD, and so each
of these triangles is equal in area.

Consider EBA and OBA: EB = OA = AE = OB since EBOA is a square,
and each triangle shares AB. By [1.8], EBA = OBA, and so EBA = OBA.

Since EBOA = EBA  OBA, EBOA = 2 · EBA.
By the proof of [4.7], EBOA = BF CO = AODH = OCGD. Since

                   EHGF = EBOA  BF CO  AODH  OCGD

it follows that EHGF = 4 · EBOA = 8 · EBA.
Notice that BCDA = 4 · EBA, and so EHGF = 2 · BCDA, which completes
the proof.

1. Prove that ACD is an isosceles triangle whose vertical angle is equal to three
times each of the base angles.

             Figure 14.4.4: [4.10]

Proof. We claim that ACD is isosceles where
                                   ACD = 3 · DAC = 3 · ADC

Since BDA = DBA = 2 · DAB by the proof of [4.10], we must have that

                                              DAB = 36
                                              DBA = 72
                                              BDA = 72

Notice that

             DAB = DAC = ADC = 36

By [1.13], ACD = 108, and since 36 · 3 = 108, the proof is complete.

               b                         y
