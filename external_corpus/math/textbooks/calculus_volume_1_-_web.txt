About Calculus Volume 1

Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features to
enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand
how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material, we
are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 1 covers functions, limits, derivatives, and
integration.

Coverage and scope

Our Calculus Volume 1 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses nationwide. We have
worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the
subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of Calculus have been developed and arranged to
provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students have already
learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to
enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses and future
careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from mathematics educators
dedicated to the project.

Pedagogical foundation

Throughout Calculus Volume 1 you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as
modern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part
of long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students.
Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as areas
of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. Student Projects in each chapter give students opportunities to
explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from determining a safe distance between the grandstand and
the track at a Formula One racetrack, to calculating the center of mass of the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed
of a skydiver. Chapter Opening Applications pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using the ideas covered in
that chapter. Problems include the hydraulic force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of relative intensity of two
earthquakes. Definitions, Rules, and Theorems are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 Proofs of theorems.

Assessments that reinforce key concepts

In-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking students
to practice the skill with a "Checkpoint" question. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so
students can apply what they've learned through practice problems. Many exercises are marked with a [T] to indicate they
are suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). Answers for selected
exercises are available in the Answer Key at the back of the book. The book also includes assessments at the end of each
chapter so students can apply what they've learned through practice problems.

Early or late transcendentals

Calculus Volume 1 is designed to accommodate both Early and Late Transcendental approaches to calculus. Exponential
and logarithmic functions are introduced informally in Chapter 1 and presented in more rigorous terms in Chapter 6.
Differentiation and integration of these functions is covered in Chapters 3-5 for instructors who want to include them with
other types of functions. These discussions, however, are in separate sections that can be skipped for instructors who prefer
to wait until the integral definitions are given before teaching the calculus derivations of exponentials and logarithms.

earthquake of magnitude 7.3 hit Haiti. A magnitude 9 earthquake shook northeastern Japan in March 2011. In April 2014,
an 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern Chile. What do these numbers mean? In particular, how
does a magnitude 9 earthquake compare with an earthquake of magnitude 8.2? Or 7.3? Later in this chapter, we show
how logarithmic functions are used to compare the relative intensity of two earthquakes based on the magnitude of each
earthquake (see Example 1.39).
Calculus is the mathematics that describes changes in functions. In this chapter, we review all the functions necessary
to study calculus. We define polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. We review how
to evaluate these functions, and we show the properties of their graphs. We provide examples of equations with terms
involving these functions and illustrate the algebraic techniques necessary to solve them. In short, this chapter provides the
foundation for the material to come. It is essential to be familiar and comfortable with these ideas before proceeding to the
formal introduction of calculus in the next chapter.

also define composition of functions and symmetry properties. Most of this material will be a review for you, but it serves
as a handy reference to remind you of some of the algebraic techniques useful for working with functions.

Functions

Given two sets A and B, a set with elements that are ordered pairs (x, y), where x is an element of A and y is an

element of B, is a relation from A to B. A relation from A to B defines a relationship between those two sets. A
function is a special type of relation in which each element of the first set is related to exactly one element of the second
set. The element of the first set is called the input; the element of the second set is called the output. Functions are used all
the time in mathematics to describe relationships between two sets. For any function, when we know the input, the output is
determined, so we say that the output is a function of the input. For example, the area of a square is determined by its side
length, so we say that the area (the output) is a function of its side length (the input). The velocity of a ball thrown in the
air can be described as a function of the amount of time the ball is in the air. The cost of mailing a package is a function of
the weight of the package. Since functions have so many uses, it is important to have precise definitions and terminology to
study them.

   Definition

   A function f consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a rule for assigning each input to exactly one output. The
   set of inputs is called the domain of the function. The set of outputs is called the range of the function.

For example, consider the function f , where the domain is the set of all real numbers and the rule is to square the input.

Then, the input x = 3 is assigned to the output 32 = 9. Since every nonnegative real number has a real-value square root,
every nonnegative number is an element of the range of this function. Since there is no real number with a square that is
negative, the negative real numbers are not elements of the range. We conclude that the range is the set of nonnegative real
numbers.

For a general function f with domain D, we often use x to denote the input and y to denote the output associated with
x. When doing so, we refer to x as the independent variable and y as the dependent variable, because it depends on x.
Using function notation, we write y = f (x), and we read this equation as "y equals f of x." For the squaring function

described earlier, we write f (x) = x2.

The concept of a function can be visualized using Figure 1.2, Figure 1.3, and Figure 1.4.

                                  Figure 1.3 A function maps every element in the domain to
                                  exactly one element in the range. Although each input can be
                                  sent to only one output, two different inputs can be sent to the
                                  same output.

                                   Figure 1.4 In this case, a graph of a function f has a domain
                                   of {1, 2, 3} and a range of {1, 2}. The independent variable
                                   is x and the dependent variable is y.

We can also visualize a function by plotting points (x, y) in the coordinate plane where y = f (x). The graph of a function
is the set of all these points. For example, consider the function f , where the domain is the set D = {1, 2, 3} and the
rule is f (x) = 3 - x. In Figure 1.5, we plot a graph of this function.
10                                                                                             Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

    Figure 1.5 Here we see a graph of the function f with
    domain {1, 2, 3} and rule f (x) = 3 - x. The graph consists
    of the points (x, f (x)) for all x in the domain.

Every function has a domain. However, sometimes a function is described by an equation, as in f (x) = x2, with no
specific domain given. In this case, the domain is taken to be the set of all real numbers x for which f (x) is a real number.

For example, since any real number can be squared, if no other domain is specified, we consider the domain of f (x) = x2
to be the set of all real numbers. On the other hand, the square root function f (x) = x only gives a real output if x is
nonnegative. Therefore, the domain of the function f (x) = x is the set of nonnegative real numbers, sometimes called the
natural domain.

For the functions f (x) = x2 and f (x) = x, the domains are sets with an infinite number of elements. Clearly we cannot

list all these elements. When describing a set with an infinite number of elements, it is often helpful to use set-builder or
interval notation. When using set-builder notation to describe a subset of all real numbers, denoted , we write

                                         x|x has some property.

We read this as the set of real numbers x such that x has some property. For example, if we were interested in the set of
real numbers that are greater than one but less than five, we could denote this set using set-builder notation by writing

                                                 {x|1 < x < 5}.                                can also be denoted using the interval

A set such as this, which contains all numbers greater than a and less than b,
notation (a, b). Therefore,

    (1,  5)  =  x|1  <                                                            x  <       

                                                                                        5.

The numbers 1 and 5 are called the endpoints of this set. If we want to consider the set that includes the endpoints, we
would denote this set by writing

                                             [1, 5] = {x|1  x  5}.

We can use similar notation if we want to include one of the endpoints, but not the other. To denote the set of nonnegative
real numbers, we would use the set-builder notation

                                                     {x|0  x}.

The smallest number in this set is zero, but this set does not have a largest number. Using interval notation, we would use
the symbol , which refers to positive infinity, and we would write the set as

                                              [0, ) = {x|0  x}.

It is important to note that  is not a real number. It is used symbolically here to indicate that this set includes all real
numbers greater than or equal to zero. Similarly, if we wanted to describe the set of all nonpositive numbers, we could write

    (-, 0] = {x|x  0}.

Here, the notation - refers to negative infinity, and it indicates that we are including all numbers less than or equal to
zero, no matter how small. The set

                                        (-, ) = x|x is any real number

refers to the set of all real numbers.

Some functions are defined using different equations for different parts of their domain. These types of functions are known
as piecewise-defined functions. For example, suppose we want to define a function f with a domain that is the set of all

real numbers such that f (x) = 3x + 1 for x  2 and f (x) = x2 for x < 2. We denote this function by writing

                                                3x + 1  x  2.
                                        f (x) =  2      x<2

                                                x

When evaluating this function for an input x, the equation to use depends on whether x  2 or x < 2. For example,
since 5 > 2, we use the fact that f (x) = 3x + 1 for x  2 and see that f (5) = 3(5) + 1 = 16. On the other hand, for

x = -1, we use the fact that f (x) = x2 for x < 2 and see that f (-1) = 1.

Example 1.1

Evaluating Functions

For the function f (x) = 3x2 + 2x - 1, evaluate
    a. f (-2)
    b. f ( 2)
    c. f (a + h)

Solution
Substitute the given value for x in the formula for f (x).

    a. f (-2) = 3(-2)2 + 2(-2) - 1 = 12 - 4 - 1 = 7
    b. f ( 2) = 3( 2)2 + 2 2 - 1 = 6 + 2 2 - 1 = 5 + 2 2
    c. f (a + h) = 3(a + h)2 + 2(a + h) - 1 = 3a2 + 2ah + h2 + 2a + 2h - 1

                                                       = 3a2 + 6ah + 3h2 + 2a + 2h - 1

    1.1 For f (x) = x2 - 3x + 5, evaluate f (1) and f (a + h).

Example 1.2

  Finding Domain and Range

  For each of the following functions, determine the i. domain and ii. range.
12                                                                                Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

    a. f (x) = (x - 4)2 + 5
    b. f (x) = 3x + 2 - 1
    c. f (x) = 3

                  x-2

    Solution
        a. Consider f (x) = (x - 4)2 + 5.

                  i. Since f (x) = (x - 4)2 + 5 is a real number for any real number x, the domain of f is the
                      interval (-, ).

                 ii. Since (x - 4)2  0, we know f (x) = (x - 4)2 + 5  5. Therefore, the range must be a subset

                 of   y|y  5. To show that every element in this set is in the range, we need to show that for a

                      given y in that set, there is a real number x such that f (x) = (x - 4)2 + 5 = y. Solving this
                      equation for x, we see that we need x such that

                                                                   (x - 4)2 = y - 5.

    This equation is satisfied as long as there exists a real number x such that
                                                x - 4 = ± y - 5.

    Since y  5, the square root is well-defined. We conclude that for x = 4 ± y - 5, f (x) = y,

    and therefore the range is       y|y        

                                            5.

    b. Consider f (x) = 3x + 2 - 1.

    i. To find the domain of f , we need the expression 3x + 2  0. Solving this inequality, we

       conclude that the domain is {x|x  -2/3}.

    ii. To find the range of f , we note that since 3x + 2  0, f (x) = 3x + 2 - 1  -1. Therefore,

       the range of f must be a subset of the set y|y  -1. To show that every element in this set is

        in the range of f , we need to show that for all y in this set, there exists a real number x in the
        domain such that f (x) = y. Let y  -1. Then, f (x) = y if and only if

                                                  3x + 2 - 1 = y.

    Solving this equation for x, we see that x must solve the equation
                                                   3x + 2 = y + 1.

    Since y  -1, such an x could exist. Squaring both sides of this equation, we have
    3x + 2 = (y + 1)2.
    Therefore, we need

                                                3x = (y + 1)2 - 2,

which implies

                                                  x  =  31    +   2   -  2.3
                                                          y
                                                                 1

We just need to verify that x is in the domain of f . Since the domain of f consists of all real
numbers greater than or equal to -2/3, and

                                               1     +   2    -  2      - 2,
                                               3y                3       3
                                                        1

          there does exist an x in the domain of f . We conclude that the range of f is y|y  -1.

c. Consider f (x) = 3/(x - 2).

       i. Since 3/(x - 2) is defined when the denominator is nonzero, the domain is {x|x  2}.

        ii. To find the range of f , we need to find the values of y such that there exists a real number x
              in the domain with the property that

                                                                 3 = y.
                                                               x-2

Solving this equation for x, we find that

                                                        x  =  3  +  2.
                                                              y

Therefore, as long as y  0,                    there exists a real number x in the domain such that f (x) = y.

Thus, the range is                y|y        

                                         0.

        1.2 Find the domain and range for f (x) = 4 - 2x + 5.

Representing Functions

Typically, a function is represented using one or more of the following tools:
     · A table
     · A graph
     · A formula

We can identify a function in each form, but we can also use them together. For instance, we can plot on a graph the values
from a table or create a table from a formula.
Tables
Functions described using a table of values arise frequently in real-world applications. Consider the following simple
example. We can describe temperature on a given day as a function of time of day. Suppose we record the temperature every
hour for a 24-hour period starting at midnight. We let our input variable x be the time after midnight, measured in hours,
and the output variable y be the temperature x hours after midnight, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. We record our data
in Table 1.1.

    Table 1.1 Temperature as a Function of Time of Day

We can see from the table that temperature is a function of time, and the temperature decreases, then increases, and then
decreases again. However, we cannot get a clear picture of the behavior of the function without graphing it.

Graphs

Given a function f described by a table, we can provide a visual picture of the function in the form of a graph. Graphing
the temperatures listed in Table 1.1 can give us a better idea of their fluctuation throughout the day. Figure 1.6 shows the
plot of the temperature function.

From the points plotted on the graph in Figure 1.6, we can visualize the general shape of the graph. It is often useful
to connect the dots in the graph, which represent the data from the table. In this example, although we cannot make any
definitive conclusion regarding what the temperature was at any time for which the temperature was not recorded, given
the number of data points collected and the pattern in these points, it is reasonable to suspect that the temperatures at other
times followed a similar pattern, as we can see in Figure 1.7.

                                       Figure 1.7 Connecting the dots in Figure 1.6 shows the
                                       general pattern of the data.
Algebraic Formulas
Sometimes we are not given the values of a function in table form, rather we are given the values in an explicit formula.
Formulas arise in many applications. For example, the area of a circle of radius r is given by the formula A(r) = r2.
When an object is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity v0 ft/s, its height above the ground from the
time it is thrown until it hits the ground is given by the formula s(t) = -16t2 + v0 t. When P dollars are invested in an
account at an annual interest rate r compounded continuously, the amount of money after t years is given by the formula
A(t) = Pert. Algebraic formulas are important tools to calculate function values. Often we also represent these functions
visually in graph form.

Given an algebraic formula for a function  f,  the graph of        f  is the set of points      f  (  x      where x is in the domain of

                                                                                            x,           ),

f and f (x) is in the range. To graph a function given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create

a table of inputs and outputs. If the domain of f consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list all of them, but

because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin.

When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of
x where f (x) = 0 are called the zeros of a function. For example, the zeros of f (x) = x2 - 4 are x = ± 2. The zeros
determine where the graph of f intersects the x -axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the graph of
the function. The graph of a function may never intersect the x-axis, or it may intersect multiple (or even infinitely many)
times.

Another point of interest is the  y -intercept, if it exists. The  y -intercept is given by        f (0).

                                                                                             0,

Since a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have, at most, one y -intercept. If x = 0
is in the domain of a function f , then f has exactly one y -intercept. If x = 0 is not in the domain of f , then f has
no y -intercept. Similarly, for any real number c, if c is in the domain of f , there is exactly one output f (c), and the
line x = c intersects the graph of f exactly once. On the other hand, if c is not in the domain of f , f (c) is not defined
and the line x = c does not intersect the graph of f . This property is summarized in the vertical line test.

    Rule: Vertical Line Test

    Given a function f , every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of f no more than once. If any vertical
    line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function.

We can use this test to determine whether a set of plotted points represents the graph of a function (Figure 1.8).

                                  Figure 1.8 (a) The set of plotted points represents the graph of
                                  a function because every vertical line intersects the set of points,
                                  at most, once. (b) The set of plotted points does not represent the
                                  graph of a function because some vertical lines intersect the set
                                  of points more than once.

Finding Zeros and y -Intercepts of a Function

Consider the function f (x) = -4x + 2.
    a. Find all zeros of f .
    b. Find the y -intercept (if any).
    c. Sketch a graph of f .

Solution
    a. To find the zeros, solve f (x) = -4x + 2 = 0. We discover that f has one zero at x = 1/2.

b.  The  y -intercept is given by       f (0) = (0,  2).

                                   0,

c. Given that f is a linear function of the form f (x) = mx + b that passes through the points (1/2, 0) and
     (0, 2), we can sketch the graph of f (Figure 1.9).

                                  Figure 1.9 The function f (x) = -4x + 2 is a line with
                                  x -intercept (1/2, 0) and y -intercept (0, 2).

Example 1.4

  Using Zeros and y -Intercepts to Sketch a Graph

Consider the function f (x) = x + 3 + 1.
    a. Find all zeros of f .
    b. Find the y -intercept (if any).
    c. Sketch a graph of f .

Solution                          x + 3 + 1 = 0. This equation implies  x + 3 = -1. Since  x + 3  0 for all
    a. To find the zeros, solve
18                                                                           Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

        x, this equation has no solutions, and therefore f has no zeros.

    b.  The  y -intercept is given by      f (0) = (0,  3 + 1).

                                       0,

    c. To graph this function, we make a table of values. Since we need x + 3  0, we need to choose values
        of x  -3. We choose values that make the square-root function easy to evaluate.

                                           x            -3 -2 1

                                                      Table 1.2

    Making use of the table and knowing that, since the function is a square root, the graph of f should be similar to
    the graph of y = x, we sketch the graph (Figure 1.10).

                                   Figure 1.10 The graph of f (x) = x + 3 + 1 has a
                                    y -intercept but no x -intercepts.

   Example 1.5

     Finding the Height of a Free-Falling Object
     If a ball is dropped from a height of 100 ft, its height s at time t is given by the function s(t) = -16t2 + 100,
     where s is measured in feet and t is measured in seconds. The domain is restricted to the interval [0, c], where
      t = 0 is the time when the ball is dropped and t = c is the time when the ball hits the ground.

          a. Create a table showing the height s(t) when t = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5. Using the data from the
               table, determine the domain for this function. That is, find the time c when the ball hits the ground.

          b. Sketch a graph of s.

    Since the ball hits the ground when t = 2.5, the domain of this function is the interval [0, 2.5].
b.

Note that for this function and the function f (x) = -4x + 2 graphed in Figure 1.9, the values of f (x) are getting
smaller as x is getting larger. A function with this property is said to be decreasing. On the other hand, for the function
 f (x) = x + 3 + 1 graphed in Figure 1.10, the values of f (x) are getting larger as the values of x are getting larger.
A function with this property is said to be increasing. It is important to note, however, that a function can be increasing on
some interval or intervals and decreasing over a different interval or intervals. For example, using our temperature function
in Figure 1.6, we can see that the function is decreasing on the interval (0, 4), increasing on the interval (4, 14), and
then decreasing on the interval (14, 23). We make the idea of a function increasing or decreasing over a particular interval
more precise in the next definition.

  Definition

  We say that a function f is increasing on the interval I if for all x1, x2  I,

                                                     f (x1)  f (x2) when x1 < x2.
  We say f is strictly increasing on the interval I if for all x1, x2  I,
20                                                                                                  Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

                                                       f (x1) < f (x2) when x1 < x2.
    We say that a function f is decreasing on the interval I if for all x1, x2  I,

                                                         f (x1)  f (x2) if x1 < x2.
    We say that a function f is strictly decreasing on the interval I if for all x1, x2  I,

For example, the function f (x) = 3x is increasing on the interval (-, ) because 3x1 < 3x2 whenever x1 < x2.

On the other hand, the function  f (x) = -x3  is decreasing on the interval             (-, )       because  -x3    >  - x3    whenever

                                                                                                                 1          2

    Figure 1.11 (a) The function f (x) = 3x is increasing on the interval (-, ). (b) The
    function f (x) = -x3 is decreasing on the interval (-, ).

Combining Functions

Now that we have reviewed the basic characteristics of functions, we can see what happens to these properties when we
combine functions in different ways, using basic mathematical operations to create new functions. For example, if the cost
for a company to manufacture x items is described by the function C(x) and the revenue created by the sale of x items is
described by the function R(x), then the profit on the manufacture and sale of x items is defined as P(x) = R(x) - C(x).
Using the difference between two functions, we created a new function.

Alternatively, we can create a new function by composing two functions. For example, given the functions f (x) = x2 and
g(x) = 3x + 1, the composite function f  g is defined such that

                                   f    g(x)  =  f  g(x)  =  g(x)                 2  =  (3x + 1)2.

The composite function g  f is defined such that

                                                       f  (x)     =       f  (x)   =  3    f  (x)  +     1  =  3x2  +  1.

Note that these two new functions are different from each other.

Combining Functions with Mathematical Operators

To combine functions using mathematical operators, we simply write the functions with the operator and simplify. Given
two functions f and g, we can define four new functions:

                                                    + g(x)        =       f (x) + g(x)                      Sum
                                                                                                            Difference
                                                f                                                           Product

                                                    - g(x)        =       f (x) - g(x)                      Quotient

                                                f      g(

                                                f                    f (x)
                                                g (x) = for g(x)  0
                                                                  g(x)

Function Composition

When we compose functions, we take a function of a function. For example, suppose the temperature T on a given day is
described as a function of time t (measured in hours after midnight) as in Table 1.1. Suppose the cost C, to heat or cool
a building for 1 hour, can be described as a function of the temperature T. Combining these two functions, we can describe
22                                                                                                               Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

the cost of heating or cooling a building as a function of time by evaluating CT(t). We have defined a new function,
denoted C  T, which is defined such that (C  T)(t) = C(T(t)) for all t in the domain of T. This new function is called
a composite function. We note that since cost is a function of temperature and temperature is a function of time, it makes
sense to define this new function (C  T)(t). It does not make sense to consider (T  C)(t), because temperature is not a
function of cost.

    Definition

    Consider the function f with domain A and range B, and the function g with domain D and range E. If B is a
    subset of D, then the composite function (g  f )(x) is the function with domain A such that

                                                       f  (x)  =       f  (x).                                                  (1.1)

A composite function g  f can be viewed in two steps. First, the function f maps each input x in the domain of f to

its output f (x) in the range of f . Second, since the range of f is a subset of the domain of g, the output f (x) is an

element in the domain of g,  and therefore it is mapped to an output                  g f (x)   in the range of  g.  In Figure  1.12, we see a

visual image of a composite function.

                             Figure 1.12 For the composite function g  f , we have

                                 f (1)  =  4,      f (2)  =  5,   and                 f (3)  =  4.

          a. We can find the formula for (g  f )(x) in two different ways. We could write
                                                  (g  f )(x) = g( f (x)) = g(x2 + 1) = x21+ 1.

Alternatively, we could write

                                         (g    f  )(x)  =       f           =  1      =  1.
                                                                               f (x) x2 + 1
                                                           g       (x)

Since x2 + 1  0 for all real numbers x, the domain of (g  f )(x) is the set of all real numbers. Since
0 < 1/(x2 + 1)  1, the range is, at most, the interval (0, 1]. To show that the range is this entire
interval, we let y = 1/(x2 + 1) and solve this equation for x to show that for all y in the interval
(0, 1], there exists a real number x such that y = 1/(x2 + 1). Solving this equation for x, we see
that x2 + 1 = 1/y, which implies that

                                                        x= ±                1  -  1.
                                                                            y

If y is in the interval (0, 1], the expression under the radical is nonnegative, and therefore there exists
a real number x such that 1/(x2 + 1) = y. We conclude that the range of g  f is the interval (0, 1].

c. We can find a formula for ( f  g)(x) in two ways. First, we could write

                                                                     1 12
                                         ( f  g)(x) = f (g(x)) = f x = x + 1.

Alternatively, we could write
                                                                  2 12

                                 ( f  g)(x) = f (g(x)) = (g(x)) + 1 = x + 1.

The domain of f  g is the set of all real numbers x such that x  0. To find the range of f , we need
to find all values y for which there exists a real number x  0 such that

                                                    12
                                                    x + 1 = y.

Solving this equation for x, we see that we need x to satisfy
                                                   12
                                                   x = y - 1,

which simplifies to                                        1  =    ±        y - 1.
Finally, we obtain                                         x

            Since 1/ y - 1 is a real number if and only if y > 1, the range of f is the set   y|y > 1.

   Example 1.9

     Application Involving a Composite Function

     A store is advertising a sale of 20% off all merchandise. Caroline has a coupon that entitles her to an additional
      15% off any item, including sale merchandise. If Caroline decides to purchase an item with an original price of
      x dollars, how much will she end up paying if she applies her coupon to the sale price? Solve this problem by
      using a composite function.

     Solution
     Since the sale price is 20% off the original price, if an item is x dollars, its sale price is given by f (x) = 0.80x.
     Since the coupon entitles an individual to 15% off the price of any item, if an item is y dollars, the price, after
     applying the coupon, is given by g(y) = 0.85y. Therefore, if the price is originally x dollars, its sale price will
     be f (x) = 0.80x and then its final price after the coupon will be g( f (x)) = 0.85(0.80x) = 0.68x.

        1.6 If items are on sale for 10% off their original price, and a customer has a coupon for an additional 30%
        off, what will be the final price for an item that is originally x dollars, after applying the coupon to the sale
        price?

Symmetry of Functions

The graphs of certain functions have symmetry properties that help us understand the function and the shape of its graph.
For example, consider the function f (x) = x4 - 2x2 - 3 shown in Figure 1.13(a). If we take the part of the curve that
lies to the right of the y-axis and flip it over the y-axis, it lays exactly on top of the curve to the left of the y-axis. In this
case, we say the function has symmetry about the y-axis. On the other hand, consider the function f (x) = x3 - 4x shown
in Figure 1.13(b). If we take the graph and rotate it 180° about the origin, the new graph will look exactly the same. In
this case, we say the function has symmetry about the origin.
26  Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

                 Figure 1.13 (a) A graph that is symmetric about the y -axis. (b) A graph that is symmetric
                   about the origin.

If we are given the graph of a function, it is easy to see whether the graph has one of these symmetry properties. But without
a graph, how can we determine algebraically whether a function f has symmetry? Looking at Figure 1.14 again, we see
that since f is symmetric about the y -axis, if the point (x, y) is on the graph, the point (-x, y) is on the graph. In other
words, f (-x) = f (x). If a function f has this property, we say f is an even function, which has symmetry about the
y-axis. For example, f (x) = x2 is even because

                                                      f (-x) = (-x)2 = x2 = f (x).
In contrast, looking at Figure 1.14 again, if a function f is symmetric about the origin, then whenever the point (x, y) is
on the graph, the point (-x, -y) is also on the graph. In other words, f (-x) = - f (x). If f has this property, we say f
is an odd function, which has symmetry about the origin. For example, f (x) = x3 is odd because

                                                    f (-x) = (-x)3 = -x3 = - f (x).

  Definition
  If f (x) = f (-x) for all x in the domain of f , then f is an even function. An even function is symmetric about the
   y-axis.
  If f (-x) = - f (x) for all x in the domain of f , then f is an odd function. An odd function is symmetric about the
   origin.

    b. f (x) = 2x5 - 4x + 5
    c. f (x) = 3x

                  x2 + 1

Solution
To determine whether a function is even or odd, we evaluate f (-x) and compare it to f(x) and - f (x).

    a. f (-x) = -5(-x)4 + 7(-x)2 - 2 = -5x4 + 7x2 - 2 = f (x). Therefore, f is even.
    b. f (-x) = 2(-x)5 - 4(-x) + 5 = -2x5 + 4x + 5. Now, f (-x)  f (x). Furthermore, noting that

         - f (x) = -2x5 + 4x - 5, we see that f (-x)  - f (x). Therefore, f is neither even nor odd.
    c. f (-x) = 3(-x)/((-x)2 + 1} = -3x/(x2 + 1) = -[3x/(x2 + 1)] = - f (x). Therefore, f is odd.

1.7 Determine whether f (x) = 4x3 - 5x is even, odd, or neither.

One symmetric function that arises frequently is the absolute value function, written as |x|. The absolute value function is
defined as

                                  f (x) =                  -x, x < 0    .                      (1.2)

                                                            x, x  0

Some students describe this function by stating that it "makes everything positive." By the definition of the absolute value

function, we see that if x < 0, then |x| = -x > 0, and if x > 0, then |x| = x > 0. However, for x = 0, |x| = 0.

Therefore, it is more accurate to say that for all nonzero inputs, the output is positive, but if x = 0, the output |x| = 0. We

conclude that the range of the absolute value function is  y|y          In Figure  1.14, we see that the absolute value function

                                                                  0.

is symmetric about the y-axis and is therefore an even function.

    Example 1.11

      Working with the Absolute Value Function

    Find the domain and range of the function f (x) = 2|x - 3| + 4.

    Solution

    Since the absolute value function is defined for all real numbers, the domain of this function is (-, ). Since

    |x - 3|  0 for all x,  the function     f (x)  =  2|x - 3| + 4                4.  Therefore, the range is, at most, the set  y|y        

                                                                                                                                        4.

    To see that the range is, in fact, this whole set, we need to show that for y  4 there exists a real number x such

    that

                                             2|x - 3| + 4 = y.

    A real number x satisfies this equation as long as

    Since y  4, we know y - 4  0,                    |x - 3| = 1(y - 4).
    that there is a solution. Furthermore,                       2

                                            and thus the right-hand side of the equation is nonnegative, so it is possible

                                                |x - 3| = -(x - 3) if x < 3           .

                                                           x - 3 if x  3

    Therefore, we see there are two solutions:

                                                      x = ± 1(y - 4) + 3.
                                                              2

    The range of this function is  y|y        

                                          4.

We have studied the general characteristics of functions, so now let's examine some specific classes of functions. We
begin by reviewing the basic properties of linear and quadratic functions, and then generalize to include higher-degree
polynomials. By combining root functions with polynomials, we can define general algebraic functions and distinguish
them from the transcendental functions we examine later in this chapter. We finish the section with examples of piecewise-
defined functions and take a look at how to sketch the graph of a function that has been shifted, stretched, or reflected from
its initial form.

Linear Functions and Slope

The easiest type of function to consider is a linear function. Linear functions have the form f (x) = ax + b, where a and
b are constants. In Figure 1.15, we see examples of linear functions when a is positive, negative, and zero. Note that if
a > 0, the graph of the line rises as x increases. In other words, f (x) = ax + b is increasing on (-, ). If a < 0,
the graph of the line falls as x increases. In this case, f (x) = ax + b is decreasing on (-, ). If a = 0, the line is
horizontal.

                                       Figure 1.15 These linear functions are increasing or
                                   decreasing on (, ) and one function is a horizontal line.

As suggested by Figure 1.15, the graph of any linear function is a line. One of the distinguishing features of a line is its
slope. The slope is the change in y for each unit change in x. The slope measures both the steepness and the direction of
a line. If the slope is positive, the line points upward when moving from left to right. If the slope is negative, the line points
downward when moving from left to right. If the slope is zero, the line is horizontal. To calculate the slope of a line, we
need to determine the ratio of the change in y versus the change in x. To do so, we choose any two points (x1, y1) and

                                        y2 - y1
(x2, y2) on the line and calculate x - x . In Figure 1.16, we see this ratio is independent of the points chosen.

                                  Figure 1.16 For any linear function, the slope
                                  (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) is independent of the choice of points
                                  (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on the line.

Definition

Consider line L passing through points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Let y = y2 - y1 and x = x2 - x1 denote the
changes in y and x, respectively. The slope of the line is

                                        y2 - y1 y                                             (1.3)
                                  m = x2 - x1 = x.

We now examine the relationship between slope and the formula for a linear function. Consider the linear function given
by the formula f (x) = ax + b. As discussed earlier, we know the graph of a linear function is given by a line. We
can use our definition of slope to calculate the slope of this line. As shown, we can determine the slope by calculating
(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) for any points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on the line. Evaluating the function f at x = 0, we see
that (0, b) is a point on this line. Evaluating this function at x = 1, we see that (1, a + b) is also a point on this line.
Therefore, the slope of this line is

                                                             (a + b) - b = a.
                                                                1-0

We have shown that the coefficient a is the slope of the line. We can conclude that the formula f (x) = ax + b describes
a line with slope a. Furthermore, because this line intersects the y -axis at the point (0, b), we see that the y -intercept
for this linear function is (0, b). We conclude that the formula f (x) = ax + b tells us the slope, a, and the y -intercept,
(0, b), for this line. Since we often use the symbol m to denote the slope of a line, we can write

                                                              f (x) = mx + b

to denote the slope-intercept form of a linear function.

Sometimes it is convenient to express a linear function in different ways. For example, suppose the graph of a linear function
passes through the point (x1, y1) and the slope of the line is m. Since any other point (x, f (x)) on the graph of f must
satisfy the equation

                                                                   f (x) - y1
                                                             m = x - x1 ,
38                                                                                Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

this linear function can be expressed by writing

                                                         f (x) - y1 = m(x - x1).

We call this equation the point-slope equation for that linear function.
Since every nonvertical line is the graph of a linear function, the points on a nonvertical line can be described using the
slope-intercept or point-slope equations. However, a vertical line does not represent the graph of a function and cannot be
expressed in either of these forms. Instead, a vertical line is described by the equation x = k for some constant k. Since
neither the slope-intercept form nor the point-slope form allows for vertical lines, we use the notation

                                                              ax + by = c,

where a, b are both not zero, to denote the standard form of a line.

    Definition                                                                                                (1.4)
    Consider a line passing through the point (x1, y1) with slope m. The equation                             (1.5)

                                                         y - y1 = m(x - x1)
    is the point-slope equation for that line.
    Consider a line with slope m and y -intercept (0, b). The equation

                                                              y = mx + b
    is an equation for that line in slope-intercept form.
    The standard form of a line is given by the equation

                                                            ax + by = c,
    where a and b are both not zero. This form is more general because it allows for a vertical line, x = k.

  following questions, assuming Jessica runs at a constant pace.

        a. Describe the distance D (in miles) Jessica runs as a linear function of her run time t (in minutes).
        b. Sketch a graph of D.
        c. Interpret the meaning of the slope.

    Solution
        a. At time t = 0, Jessica is at her house, so D(0) = 0. At time t = 78 minutes, Jessica has finished
             running 9 mi, so D(78) = 9. The slope of the linear function is

                                                              m= 9-0 = 3.
                                                                    78 - 0 26

             The y -intercept is (0, 0), so the equation for this linear function is

                                                                  D(t) = 3 t.

        b. To graph D, use the fact that the graph passes through the origin and has slope m = 3/26.

    c. The slope m = 3/26  0.115 describes the distance (in miles) Jessica runs per minute, or her average
        velocity.

Polynomials

A linear function is a special type of a more general class of functions: polynomials. A polynomial function is any function
that can be written in the form

                 f (x) = an xn + an - 1 xn - 1 + ... + a1 x + a0                  (1.7)

for some integer n  0 and constants an, an - 1 ,...,a0, where an  0. In the case when n = 0, we allow for a0 = 0;
if a0 = 0, the function f (x) = 0 is called the zero function. The value n is called the degree of the polynomial; the
constant an is called the leading coefficient. A linear function of the form f (x) = mx + b is a polynomial of degree 1
if m  0 and degree 0 if m = 0. A polynomial of degree 0 is also called a constant function. A polynomial function

of degree 2 is called a quadratic function. In particular, a quadratic function has the form f (x) = ax2 + bx + c, where
a  0. A polynomial function of degree 3 is called a cubic function.

Power Functions

Some polynomial functions are power functions. A power function is any function of the form f (x) = axb, where a and

b are any real numbers. The exponent in a power function can be any real number, but here we consider the case when the
exponent is a positive integer. (We consider other cases later.) If the exponent is a positive integer, then f (x) = axn is a
polynomial. If n is even, then f (x) = axn is an even function because f (-x) = a(-x)n = axn if n is even. If n is odd,
then f (x) = axn is an odd function because f (-x) = a(-x)n = -axn if n is odd (Figure 1.18).

                 Figure 1.18 (a) For any even integer n, f (x) = axn is an even function. (b) For any odd
                 integer n, f (x) = axn is an odd function.

Behavior at Infinity

To determine the behavior of a function f as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values f (x) as the inputs,
x, become larger. For some functions, the values of f (x) approach a finite number. For example, for the function
 f (x) = 2 + 1/x, the values 1/x become closer and closer to zero for all values of x as they get larger and larger. For this
function, we say " f (x) approaches two as x goes to infinity," and we write f (x)  2 as x  . The line y = 2 is a
horizontal asymptote for the function f (x) = 2 + 1/x because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as x gets
larger.

For other functions, the values f (x) may not approach a finite number but instead may become larger for all values of x
as they get larger. In that case, we say " f (x) approaches infinity as x approaches infinity," and we write f (x)   as
x  . For example, for the function f (x) = 3x2, the outputs f (x) become larger as the inputs x get larger. We can
conclude that the function f (x) = 3x2 approaches infinity as x approaches infinity, and we write 3x2   as x  .
The behavior as x  - and the meaning of f (x)  - as x   or x  - can be defined similarly. We can
describe what happens to the values of f (x) as x   and as x  - as the end behavior of the function.

To understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and cubic functions. The behavior for
higher-degree polynomials can be analyzed similarly. Consider a quadratic function f (x) = ax2 + bx + c. If a > 0, the
values f (x)   as x  ±. If a < 0, the values f (x)  - as x  ±. Since the graph of a quadratic function
is a parabola, the parabola opens upward if a > 0; the parabola opens downward if a < 0. (See Figure 1.19(a).)

Now consider a cubic function f (x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d. If a > 0, then f (x)   as x   and f (x)  -
as x  -. If a < 0, then f (x)  - as x   and f (x)   as x  -. As we can see from both of these
graphs, the leading term of the polynomial determines the end behavior. (See Figure 1.19(b).)

Zeros of Polynomial Functions

Another characteristic of the graph of a polynomial function is where it intersects the x -axis. To determine where a function
 f intersects the x -axis, we need to solve the equation f (x) = 0 for x. In the case of the linear function f (x) = mx + b,
the x -intercept is given by solving the equation mx + b = 0. In this case, we see that the x -intercept is given by
(-b/m, 0). In the case of a quadratic function, finding the x -intercept(s) requires finding the zeros of a quadratic equation:
ax2 + bx + c = 0. In some cases, it is easy to factor the polynomial ax2 + bx + c to find the zeros. If not, we make use
of the quadratic formula.

    Rule: The Quadratic Formula

    Consider the quadratic equation

                                     ax2 + bx + c = 0,

    where a  0. The solutions of this equation are given by the quadratic formula

                                     x = -b ± b2 - 4ac.                            (1.8)

                                     2a

    If the discriminant b2 - 4ac > 0, this formula tells us there are two real numbers that satisfy the quadratic equation.

    If b2 - 4ac = 0, this formula tells us there is only one solution, and it is a real number. If b2 - 4ac < 0, no real
    numbers satisfy the quadratic equation.

In the case of higher-degree polynomials, it may be more complicated to determine where the graph intersects the x -axis.
In some instances, it is possible to find the x -intercepts by factoring the polynomial to find its zeros. In other cases, it is
impossible to calculate the exact values of the x -intercepts. However, as we see later in the text, in cases such as this, we
can use analytical tools to approximate (to a very high degree) where the x -intercepts are located. Here we focus on the
graphs of polynomials for which we can calculate their zeros explicitly.

Example 1.14

  Graphing Polynomial Functions

For the following functions a. and b., i. describe the behavior of f (x) as x  ±, ii. find all zeros of f , and
iii. sketch a graph of f .

    a. f (x) = -2x2 + 4x - 1

    b. f (x) = x3 - 3x2 - 4x

Solution
    a. The function f (x) = -2x2 + 4x - 1 is a quadratic function.
              i. Because a = -2 < 0, as x  ±, f (x)  -.
             ii. To find the zeros of f , use the quadratic formula. The zeros are

                                  x = -4 ± 42 - 4(-2)(-1) = -4 ± 8 = -4 ± 2 2 = 2 ± 2.2
                                  2(-2)  -4              -4

iii. To sketch the graph of f , use the information from your previous answers and combine it with

the fact that the graph is a parabola opening downward.

b. The function f (x) = x3 - 3x2 - 4x is a cubic function.
         i. Because a = 1 > 0, as x  , f (x)  . As x  -, f (x)  -.
        ii. To find the zeros of f , we need to factor the polynomial. First, when we factor x out of all the
              terms, we find
                                                        f (x) = x(x2 - 3x - 4).

             Then, when we factor the quadratic function x2 - 3x - 4, we find
                                                        f (x) = x(x - 4)(x + 1).

         Therefore, the zeros of f are x = 0, 4, -1.
    iii. Combining the results from parts i. and ii., draw a rough sketch of f .

        1.10 Consider the quadratic function f (x) = 3x2 - 6x + 2. Find the zeros of f . Does the parabola open
        upward or downward?

Mathematical Models
A large variety of real-world situations can be described using mathematical models. A mathematical model is a method of
simulating real-life situations with mathematical equations. Physicists, engineers, economists, and other researchers develop
models by combining observation with quantitative data to develop equations, functions, graphs, and other mathematical
tools to describe the behavior of various systems accurately. Models are useful because they help predict future outcomes.
Examples of mathematical models include the study of population dynamics, investigations of weather patterns, and
predictions of product sales.
As an example, let's consider a mathematical model that a company could use to describe its revenue for the sale of a
particular item. The amount of revenue R a company receives for the sale of n items sold at a price of p dollars per item
is described by the equation R = p · n. The company is interested in how the sales change as the price of the item changes.
Suppose the data in Table 1.6 show the number of units a company sells as a function of the price per item.

                                  Function of Price per Unit p (in Dollars)

In Figure 1.20, we see the graph the number of units sold (in thousands) as a function of price (in dollars). We note from
the shape of the graph that the number of units sold is likely a linear function of price per item, and the data can be closely
approximated by the linear function n = -1.04p + 26 for 0  p  25, where n predicts the number of units sold in

thousands. Using this linear function, the revenue (in thousands of dollars) can be estimated by the quadratic function

                                  R( p)  =  p·  -1.04 p  +          =  -1.04 p 2  +  26 p

                                                            26

for 0  p  25. In Example 1.15, we use this quadratic function to predict the amount of revenue the company receives
depending on the price the company charges per item. Note that we cannot conclude definitively the actual number of units
sold for values of p, for which no data are collected. However, given the other data values and the graph shown, it seems
reasonable that the number of units sold (in thousands) if the price charged is p dollars may be close to the values predicted
by the linear function n = -1.04p + 26.

                        Figure 1.20 The data collected for the number of items sold as a function of
                      price is roughly linear. We use the linear function n = -1.04p + 26 to estimate
                        this function.

    Maximizing Revenue

    A company is interested in predicting the amount of revenue it will receive depending on the price it charges for a
    particular item. Using the data from Table 1.6, the company arrives at the following quadratic function to model
    revenue R (in thousands of dollars) as a function of price per item p:

                        R( p)  =      p·  -1.04 p  +                              =  -1.04 p 2  +  26 p

                                                      26

    for 0  p  25.

    a. Predict the revenue if the company sells the item at a price of p = $5 and p = $17.

    b. Find the zeros of this function and interpret the meaning of the zeros.
    c. Sketch a graph of R.
    d. Use the graph to determine the value of p that maximizes revenue. Find the maximum revenue.

    Solution
        a. Evaluating the revenue function at p = 5 and p = 17, we can conclude that

                   R(5) = -1.04(5)2 + 26(5) = 104, so revenue = $104,000;
                   R(17) = -1.04(17)2 + 26(17) = 141.44, so revenue = $141,440.

    b. The zeros of this function can be found by solving the equation -1.04p2 + 26p = 0. When we factor

    the quadratic expression, we get  p-1.04 p     +                              =  0.  The solutions to this equation are given by

                                                      26

    p = 0, 25. For these values of p, the revenue is zero. When p = $0, the revenue is zero because the

    company is giving away its merchandise for free. When p = $25, the revenue is zero because the price

    is too high, and no one will buy any items.

    c. Knowing the fact that the function is quadratic, we also know the graph is a parabola. Since the
        leading coefficient is negative, the parabola opens downward. One property of parabolas is that they are
        symmetric about the axis, so since the zeros are at p = 0 and p = 25, the parabola must be symmetric

        about the line halfway between them, or p = 12.5.

d. The function is a parabola with zeros at p = 0 and p = 25, and it is symmetric about the line
     p = 12.5, so the maximum revenue occurs at a price of p = $12.50 per item. At that price, the revenue
    is R(p) = -1.04(12.5)2 + 26(12.5) = $162, 500.

Algebraic Functions

By allowing for quotients and fractional powers in polynomial functions, we create a larger class of functions. An algebraic
function is one that involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, rational powers, and roots. Two types of
algebraic functions are rational functions and root functions.

Just as rational numbers are quotients of integers, rational functions are quotients of polynomials. In particular, a rational
function is any function of the form f (x) = p(x)/q(x), where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials. For example,

                                  f (x) = 3x - 1  and  g(x) = 4
                                  5x + 2               x2 + 1

are rational functions. A root function is a power function of the form f (x) = x1/n, where n is a positive integer greater
than one. For example, f (x) = x1/2 = x is the square-root function and g(x) = x1/3 = 3 x is the cube-root function. By
allowing for compositions of root functions and rational functions, we can create other algebraic functions. For example,
 f (x) = 4 - x2 is an algebraic function.

    Example 1.16

      Finding Domain and Range for Algebraic Functions

    For each of the following functions, find the domain and range.

    a. f (x) = 3x - 1
                  5x + 2

    b. To find the domain of f , we need 4 - x2  0 . Or, 4  x2 Or x2  4 , the solution to which is

    - 2  x  2 . Therefore, the domain is {x| - 2  x  2} . If - 2  x  2 , then 0  4 - x2  4 .

    Therefore, 0          4 - x2  2  and the range of  f  is                      y|0    x          .

                                                                                              2

    Solution
        a. It is not possible to divide by zero, so the domain is the set of real numbers x such that x  -2/5. To
             find the range, we need to find the values y for which there exists a real number x such that
                                                                  y = 3x - 1.
                                                                       5x + 2

             When we multiply both sides of this equation by 5x + 2, we see that x must satisfy the equation
                                                              5xy + 2y = 3x - 1.

    From this equation, we can see that x must satisfy
                                                    2y + 1 = x(3 - 5y).

    If y = 3/5,  this equation has no solution. On the other hand, as long as y  3/5,
                                                       x = 2y + 1 3 - 5y

       satisfies this equation. We can conclude that the range of f is y|y  3/5.

    b. To find the domain of f , we need 4 - x2  0. When we factor, we write
         4 - x2 = (2 - x)(2 + x)  0. This inequality holds if and only if both terms are positive or both terms
        are negative. For both terms to be positive, we need to find x such that

                                                2 - x  0 and 2 + x  0.

    These two inequalities reduce to 2  x and x  -2. Therefore, the set {x| - 2  x  2} must be part

    of the domain. For both terms to be negative, we need
                                            2 - x  0 and 2 + x  0.

    These two inequalities also reduce to 2  x and x  -2. There are no values of x that satisfy both of

    these inequalities. Thus, we can conclude the domain of this function is {x| - 2  x  2}.

    If -2  x  2, then 0  4 - x2  4. Therefore, 0  4 - x2  2, and the range of f is

    y|0    y         

                 2.

1.11 Find the domain and range for the function f (x) = (5x + 2)/(2x - 1).

The root functions f (x) = x1/n have defining characteristics depending on whether n is odd or even. For all even integers
n  2, the domain of f (x) = x1/n is the interval [0, ). For all odd integers n  1, the domain of f (x) = x1/n is
the set of all real numbers. Since x1/n = (-x)1/n for odd integers n, f (x) = x1/n is an odd function if n is odd. See the
graphs of root functions for different values of n in Figure 1.21.

Figure 1.21 (a) If n is even, the domain of f (x) = n x is [0, ). (b) If n is odd, the domain of f (x) = n x is
(-, ) and the function f (x) = n x is an odd function.

 Example 1.17

   Finding Domains for Algebraic Functions

    For each of the following functions, determine the domain of the function.
        a. f (x) = x2 - 1 3
        b. f (x) = 2x + 5
                       3x2 + 4
        c. f (x) = 4 - 3x
        d. f (x) = 3 2x - 1

    Solution
        a. You cannot divide by zero, so the domain is the set of values x such that x2 - 1  0. Therefore, the

           domain is {x|x  ±1}.

        b. You need to determine the values of x for which the denominator is zero. Since 3x2 + 4  4 for all real
             numbers x, the denominator is never zero. Therefore, the domain is (-, ).

        c. Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, the domain is the set of values x for
50  Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

            which 4 - 3x  0. Therefore, the domain is {x|x  4/3}.

          d. The cube root is defined for all real numbers, so the domain is the interval (-, ).

        1.12 Find the domain for each of the following functions: f (x) = (5 - 2x)/(x2 + 2) and g(x) = 5x - 1.

Transcendental Functions

Thus far, we have discussed algebraic functions. Some functions, however, cannot be described by basic algebraic
operations. These functions are known as transcendental functions because they are said to "transcend," or go beyond,
algebra. The most common transcendental functions are trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. A
trigonometric function relates the ratios of two sides of a right triangle. They are sinx, cosx, tanx, cotx, secx, and cscx.
(We discuss trigonometric functions later in the chapter.) An exponential function is a function of the form f (x) = bx,
where the base b > 0, b  1. A logarithmic function is a function of the form f (x) = logb(x) for some constant
b > 0, b  1, where logb (x) = y if and only if by = x. (We also discuss exponential and logarithmic functions later in
the chapter.)

   Example 1.18

     Classifying Algebraic and Transcendental Functions

      Classify each of the following functions, a. through c., as algebraic or transcendental.
          a. f (x) = x3 + 1
                         4x + 2
          b. f (x) = 2x2
          c. f (x) = sin(2x)

     Solution
           a. Since this function involves basic algebraic operations only, it is an algebraic function.
           b. This function cannot be written as a formula that involves only basic algebraic operations, so it is
               transcendental. (Note that algebraic functions can only have powers that are rational numbers.)
           c. As in part b., this function cannot be written using a formula involving basic algebraic operations only;
               therefore, this function is transcendental.

        1.13 Is f (x) = x/2 an algebraic or a transcendental function?

Piecewise-Defined Functions

Sometimes a function is defined by different formulas on different parts of its domain. A function with this property is
known as a piecewise-defined function. The absolute value function is an example of a piecewise-defined function because

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12
Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs                                                                                  51

the formula changes with the sign of x:

                                         f (x) =   -x, x < 0 .

                                                    x, x  0

Other piecewise-defined functions may be represented by completely different formulas, depending on the part of the
domain in which a point falls. To graph a piecewise-defined function, we graph each part of the function in its respective
domain, on the same coordinate system. If the formula for a function is different for x < a and x > a, we need to pay

special attention to what happens at x = a when we graph the function. Sometimes the graph needs to include an open or
closed circle to indicate the value of the function at x = a. We examine this in the next example.

Example 1.19

Graphing a Piecewise-Defined Function

Sketch a graph of the following piecewise-defined function:

Solution

Graph the linear function y = x + 3 on the interval (-, 1) and graph the quadratic function y = (x - 2)2
on the interval [1, ). Since the value of the function at x = 1 is given by the formula f (x) = (x - 2)2, we
see that f (1) = 1. To indicate this on the graph, we draw a closed circle at the point (1, 1). The value of the
function is given by f (x) = x + 2 for all x < 1, but not at x = 1. To indicate this on the graph, we draw an
open circle at (1, 4).

      Parking Fees Described by a Piecewise-Defined Function

    In a big city, drivers are charged variable rates for parking in a parking garage. They are charged $10 for the first
    hour or any part of the first hour and an additional $2 for each hour or part thereof up to a maximum of $30 for
    the day. The parking garage is open from 6 a.m. to 12 midnight.

        a. Write a piecewise-defined function that describes the cost C to park in the parking garage as a function
             of hours parked x.

        b. Sketch a graph of this function C(x).

    Solution

    a. Since the parking garage is open 18 hours each day, the domain for this function is {x|0 < x  18}. The

        cost to park a car at this parking garage can be described piecewise by the function

               10, 0 < x  1
               12, 1 < x  2
                      14, 2 < x  3
              C(x) =                .

                     30, 10 < x  18

    b. The graph of the function consists of several horizontal line segments.

         49¢ for the first ounce and 21¢ for each additional ounce. Write a piecewise-defined function describing the
        cost C as a function of the weight x for 0 < x  3, where C is measured in cents and x is measured in
        ounces.

Transformations of Functions

We have seen several cases in which we have added, subtracted, or multiplied constants to form variations of simple

functions. In the previous example, for instance, we subtracted 2 from the argument of the function y = x2 to get the
function f (x) = (x - 2)2. This subtraction represents a shift of the function y = x2 two units to the right. A shift,
horizontally or vertically, is a type of transformation of a function. Other transformations include horizontal and vertical
scalings, and reflections about the axes.

A vertical shift of a function occurs if we add or subtract the same constant to each output y. For c > 0, the graph of
 f (x) + c is a shift of the graph of f (x) up c units, whereas the graph of f (x) - c is a shift of the graph of f (x) down
c units. For example, the graph of the function f (x) = x3 + 4 is the graph of y = x3 shifted up 4 units; the graph of the
function f (x) = x3 - 4 is the graph of y = x3 shifted down 4 units (Figure 1.23).

                   Figure 1.23 (a) For c > 0, the graph of y = f (x) + c is a vertical shift up c units of
                   the graph of y = f (x). (b) For c > 0, the graph of y = f (x) - c is a vertical shift down
                    c units of the graph of y = f (x).

A horizontal shift of a function occurs if we add or subtract the same constant to each input x. For c > 0, the graph of
 f (x + c) is a shift of the graph of f (x) to the left c units; the graph of f (x - c) is a shift of the graph of f (x) to the
right c units. Why does the graph shift left when adding a constant and shift right when subtracting a constant? To answer
this question, let's look at an example.

Consider the function f (x) = |x + 3| and evaluate this function at x - 3. Since f (x - 3) = |x| and x - 3 < x, the graph
of f (x) = |x + 3| is the graph of y = |x| shifted left 3 units. Similarly, the graph of f (x) = |x - 3| is the graph of y = |x|

shifted right 3 units (Figure 1.24).
54  Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

Figure 1.24 (a) For c > 0, the graph of y = f (x + c) is a horizontal shift left c units of the graph of y = f (x). (b) For
c > 0, the graph of y = f (x - c) is a horizontal shift right c units of the graph of y = f (x).

A vertical scaling of a graph occurs if we multiply all outputs y of a function by the same positive constant. For c > 0,
the graph of the function c f (x) is the graph of f (x) scaled vertically by a factor of c. If c > 1, the values of the
outputs for the function c f (x) are larger than the values of the outputs for the function f (x); therefore, the graph has been
stretched vertically. If 0 < c < 1, then the outputs of the function c f (x) are smaller, so the graph has been compressed.
For example, the graph of the function f (x) = 3x2 is the graph of y = x2 stretched vertically by a factor of 3, whereas the
graph of f (x) = x2 /3 is the graph of y = x2 compressed vertically by a factor of 3 (Figure 1.25).

                      Figure 1.25 (a) If c > 1, the graph of y = c f (x) is a vertical stretch of the graph
                      of y = f (x). (b) If 0 < c < 1, the graph of y = c f (x) is a vertical compression of
                      the graph of y = f (x).

The horizontal scaling of a function occurs if we multiply the inputs x by the same positive constant. For c > 0, the
graph of the function f (cx) is the graph of f (x) scaled horizontally by a factor of c. If c > 1, the graph of f (cx) is the
graph of f (x) compressed horizontally. If 0 < c < 1, the graph of f (cx) is the graph of f (x) stretched horizontally. For

example, consider the function f (x) = 2x and evaluate f at x/2. Since f (x/2) = x, the graph of f (x) = 2x is the
graph of y = x compressed horizontally. The graph of y = x/2 is a horizontal stretch of the graph of y = x (Figure
1.26).

                 Figure 1.26 (a) If c > 1, the graph of y = f (cx) is a horizontal compression of the graph
                 of y = f (x). (b) If 0 < c < 1, the graph of y = f (cx) is a horizontal stretch of the graph of
                  y = f (x).

We have explored what happens to the graph of a function f when we multiply f by a constant c > 0 to get a new
function c f (x). We have also discussed what happens to the graph of a function f when we multiply the independent
variable x by c > 0 to get a new function f (cx). However, we have not addressed what happens to the graph of the
function if the constant c is negative. If we have a constant c < 0, we can write c as a positive number multiplied by
-1; but, what kind of transformation do we get when we multiply the function or its argument by -1 ? When we multiply
all the outputs by -1, we get a reflection about the x -axis. When we multiply all inputs by -1, we get a reflection
about the y -axis. For example, the graph of f (x) = -(x3 + 1) is the graph of y = (x3 + 1) reflected about the x -axis.
The graph of f (x) = (-x)3 + 1 is the graph of y = x3 + 1 reflected about the y -axis (Figure 1.27).
56                                                                                                     Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

    Figure 1.27 (a) The graph of y = - f (x) is the graph of
    y = f (x) reflected about the x -axis. (b) The graph of
    y = f (-x) is the graph of y = f (x) reflected about the
    y -axis.

If the graph of a function consists of more than one transformation of another graph, it is important to transform the graph

in the correct order. Given a function  f (x),  the graph of the related function  y  =  c  f  a(x  +         +  d  can be obtained from

                                                                                                       b)

the graph of y = f (x) by performing the transformations in the following order.

    1. Horizontal shift of the graph of y = f (x). If b > 0, shift left. If b < 0, shift right.

    2. Horizontal scaling of the graph of y = f (x + b) by a factor of |a|. If a < 0, reflect the graph about the y -axis.

    3. Vertical scaling of the graph of y = f (a(x + b)) by a factor of |c|. If c < 0, reflect the graph about the x -axis.

    4. Vertical shift of the graph of y = c f (a(x + b)). If d > 0, shift up. If d < 0, shift down.

We can summarize the different transformations and their related effects on the graph of a function in the following table.

Trigonometric functions are used to model many phenomena, including sound waves, vibrations of strings, alternating
electrical current, and the motion of pendulums. In fact, almost any repetitive, or cyclical, motion can be modeled by some
combination of trigonometric functions. In this section, we define the six basic trigonometric functions and look at some of
the main identities involving these functions.

Radian Measure

To use trigonometric functions, we first must understand how to measure the angles. Although we can use both radians and
degrees, radians are a more natural measurement because they are related directly to the unit circle, a circle with radius 1.
The radian measure of an angle is defined as follows. Given an angle , let s be the length of the corresponding arc on
the unit circle (Figure 1.30). We say the angle corresponding to the arc of length 1 has radian measure 1.

                                   Figure 1.30 The radian measure of an angle  is the arc
                                   length s of the associated arc on the unit circle.

Since an angle of 360° corresponds to the circumference of a circle, or an arc of length 2, we conclude that an angle
with a degree measure of 360° has a radian measure of 2. Similarly, we see that 180° is equivalent to  radians. Table
1.8 shows the relationship between common degree and radian values.

The Six Basic Trigonometric Functions

Trigonometric functions allow us to use angle measures, in radians or degrees, to find the coordinates of a point on any
circle--not only on a unit circle--or to find an angle given a point on a circle. They also define the relationship among the
sides and angles of a triangle.
To define the trigonometric functions, first consider the unit circle centered at the origin and a point P = (x, y) on the unit
circle. Let  be an angle with an initial side that lies along the positive x -axis and with a terminal side that is the line
segment OP. An angle in this position is said to be in standard position (Figure 1.31). We can then define the values of
the six trigonometric functions for  in terms of the coordinates x and y.
64                                                                                         Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

                Figure 1.31 The angle  is in standard position. The values

                of the trigonometric functions for  are defined in terms of the
                coordinates x and y.

    Definition

    Let P = (x, y) be a point on the unit circle centered at the origin O. Let  be an angle with an initial side along the
    positive x -axis and a terminal side given by the line segment OP. The trigonometric functions are then defined as

                sin = y     csc                                                      =  1                (1.9)
                                                                                        y

                cos = x     sec                                                      =  1
                         y                                                              x

                tan = x     cot                                                      =  x
                                                                                        y

    If x = 0, sec  and tan are undefined. If y = 0, then cot  and csc  are undefined.

We can see that for a point P = (x, y) on a circle of radius r with a corresponding angle , the coordinates x and y
satisfy

                         cos   =                                                  x
                                                                                  r

                x = r cos
                          y

                sin = r

                y = r sin.

The values of the other trigonometric functions can be expressed in terms of x, y, and r (Figure 1.32).

    a.  On the unit circle, the angle  =  2  corresponds to the point             - 1,    3.  Therefore,  sin2   =  y  =   3.

        Knowing the fact that an angle of    7  corresponds to the point                  2,  -  2,  we can conclude that

  Constructing a Wooden Ramp

  A wooden ramp is to be built with one end on the ground and the other end at the top of a short staircase. If the
  top of the staircase is 4 ft from the ground and the angle between the ground and the ramp is to be 10°, how
68                                                                                                   Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

    long does the ramp need to be?

    Solution
    Let x denote the length of the ramp. In the following image, we see that x needs to satisfy the equation
    sin(10°) = 4/x. Solving this equation for x, we see that x = 4/sin(10°)  23.035 ft.

Trigonometric Identities

A trigonometric identity is an equation involving trigonometric functions that is true for all angles  for which the
functions are defined. We can use the identities to help us solve or simplify equations. The main trigonometric identities are
listed next.

Solution
    a. Using the double-angle formula for cos(2), we see that  is a solution of

                                                         1 + cos(2) = cos

if and only if

                                         1 + 2cos2  - 1 = cos,

which is true if and only if

                                         2cos2  - cos = 0.

To solve this equation, it is important to note that we need to factor the left-hand side and not divide both
sides of the equation by cos . The problem with dividing by cos  is that it is possible that cos  is
zero. In fact, if we did divide both sides of the equation by cos , we would miss some of the solutions
of the original equation. Factoring the left-hand side of the equation, we see that  is a solution of this
equation if and only if

                                               cos(2cos - 1) = 0.

Since cos  = 0 when

                                          = ,  ± ,  ± 2,...,
                                              22 2

and cos  = 1/2 when

                                      = ,  ± 2,... or  = - , -  ± 2,...,
                                     33                       33

we conclude that the set of solutions to this equation is

                                   =  + n,  =  + 2n, and  = -  + 2n, n = 0, ± 1, ± 2,....233

b. Using the double-angle formula for sin(2) and the reciprocal identity for tan(), the equation can be

written as

                                         2sin cos = sin .
                                                          cos 

To solve this equation, we multiply both sides by cos  to eliminate the denominator, and say that if 
satisfies this equation, then  satisfies the equation

                                             2 sincos2  - sin = 0.

However, we need to be a little careful here. Even if  satisfies this new equation, it may not satisfy the
original equation because, to satisfy the original equation, we would need to be able to divide both sides
of the equation by cos . However, if cos  = 0, we cannot divide both sides of the equation by cos .
Therefore, it is possible that we may arrive at extraneous solutions. So, at the end, it is important to check
for extraneous solutions. Returning to the equation, it is important that we factor sin  out of both terms
on the left-hand side instead of dividing both sides of the equation by sin . Factoring the left-hand side
of the equation, we can rewrite this equation as

                                              sin(2cos2  - 1) = 0.
70                                                                                       Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

          Therefore, the solutions are given by the angles  such that sin  = 0 or cos2  = 1/2. The solutions
          of the first equation are  = 0, ± , ± 2,.... The solutions of the second equation are
            = /4, (/4) ± (/2), (/4) ± ,.... After checking for extraneous solutions, the set of solutions to the
          equation is

                                          = n and  =  + n, n = 0, ± 1, ± 2,....
                                                                 42

    Example 1.26

      Proving a Trigonometric Identity

    Prove the trigonometric identity 1 + tan2  = sec2 .

    Solution
    We start with the identity

                                        sin2  + cos2  = 1.

    Dividing both sides of this equation by cos2 , we obtain

                                        sin2  + 1 = 1 .
                                        cos2                                      cos2 

    Since sin /cos  = tan and 1/cos  = sec, we conclude that

                                        tan2  + 1 = sec2 .

        1.21 Prove the trigonometric identity 1 + cot2  = csc2 .

Graphs and Periods of the Trigonometric Functions

We have seen that as we travel around the unit circle, the values of the trigonometric functions repeat. We can see this
pattern in the graphs of the functions. Let P = (x, y) be a point on the unit circle and let  be the corresponding angle
. Since the angle  and  + 2 correspond to the same point P, the values of the trigonometric functions at  and
at  + 2 are the same. Consequently, the trigonometric functions are periodic functions. The period of a function f is
defined to be the smallest positive value p such that f (x + p) = f (x) for all values x in the domain of f . The sine,
cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have a period of 2. Since the tangent and cotangent functions repeat on an interval
of length , their period is  (Figure 1.34).

Figure 1.34 The six trigonometric functions are periodic.

Just as with algebraic functions, we can apply transformations to trigonometric functions. In particular, consider the
following function:

                                  f (x)  =  A sinB(x  -          +  C.  (1.10)

                                                         )

In Figure 1.35, the constant  causes a horizontal or phase shift. The factor B changes the period. This transformed

sine function will have a period 2/|B|. The factor A results in a vertical stretch by a factor of |A|. We say |A| is the

"amplitude of f . " The constant C causes a vertical shift.

                                       Figure 1.35 A graph of a general sine function.
Notice in Figure 1.34 that the graph of y = cos x is the graph of y = sin x shifted to the left /2 units. Therefore, we
72                                                 Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

can write cos x = sin(x + /2). Similarly, we can view the graph of y = sin x as the graph of y = cos x shifted right /2
units, and state that sin x = cos(x - /2).

A shifted sine curve arises naturally when graphing the number of hours of daylight in a given location as a function of

the day of the year. For example, suppose a city reports that June 21 is the longest day of the year with 15.7 hours and
December 21 is the shortest day of the year with 8.3 hours. It can be shown that the function

    h(t)  =            2    (t  -           +  12
                       365
             3.7 sin               80.5)

is a model for the number of hours of daylight h as a function of day of the year t (Figure 1.36).

                          Figure 1.36 The hours of daylight as a function of day of the year can be modeled
                          by a shifted sine curve.

    1.4.5       Evaluate inverse trigonometric functions.

An inverse function reverses the operation done by a particular function. In other words, whatever a function does, the
inverse function undoes it. In this section, we define an inverse function formally and state the necessary conditions for an
inverse function to exist. We examine how to find an inverse function and study the relationship between the graph of a
function and the graph of its inverse. Then we apply these ideas to define and discuss properties of the inverse trigonometric
functions.

Existence of an Inverse Function

We begin with an example. Given a function f and an output y = f (x), we are often interested in finding what

value or values x were mapped to y by f . For example, consider the function f (x) = x3 + 4. Since any output

y = x3 + 4, we can solve this equation for x to find that the input is x = 3 y - 4. This equation defines x as a function

of y. Denoting this function as f -1, and writing x = f -1 (y) = 3 y - 4, we see that for any x in the domain of

    -1           -1  3         Thus, this new function,          f -1,  "undid" what the original function f did. A function
f,  f  f (x) =             x.
                f x + 4 =

with this property is called the inverse function of the original function.

    Definition

    Given a function f with domain D and range R, its inverse function (if it exists) is the function f -1 with domain
    R and range D such that f -1 (y) = x if f (x) = y. In other words, for a function f and its inverse f -1,

                f  -1  f (x)     =  x  for  all  x  in  D,  and      -1 (y)     =  y  for  all  y  in  R.  (1.11)

                                                                 ff           

Note that f -1 is read as "f inverse." Here, the -1 is not used as an exponent and f -1 (x)  1/ f (x). Figure 1.37 shows
the relationship between the domain and range of f and the domain and range of f -1.

                                   Figure 1.37 Given a function f and its inverse
                                    f -1, f -1 (y) = x if and only if f (x) = y. The range of f
                                   becomes the domain of f -1 and the domain of f becomes the
                                   range of f -1.

Recall that a function has exactly one output for each input. Therefore, to define an inverse function, we need to map each

input to exactly one output. For example, let's try to find the inverse function for f (x) = x2. Solving the equation y = x2
for x, we arrive at the equation x = ± y. This equation does not describe x as a function of y because there are two
solutions to this equation for every y > 0. The problem with trying to find an inverse function for f (x) = x2 is that two
inputs are sent to the same output for each output y > 0. The function f (x) = x3 + 4 discussed earlier did not have this
problem. For that function, each input was sent to a different output. A function that sends each input to a different output
is called a one-to-one function.

  Definition
  We say a f is a one-to-one function if f (x1)  f (x2) when x1  x2.

One way to determine whether a function is one-to-one is by looking at its graph. If a function is one-to-one, then no two
inputs can be sent to the same output. Therefore, if we draw a horizontal line anywhere in the xy -plane, according to the
horizontal line test, it cannot intersect the graph more than once. We note that the horizontal line test is different from
the vertical line test. The vertical line test determines whether a graph is the graph of a function. The horizontal line test
determines whether a function is one-to-one (Figure 1.38).

  Rule: Horizontal Line Test
  A function f is one-to-one if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph of f no more than once.

                               Figure 1.38 (a) The function f (x) = x2 is not one-to-one
                                   because it fails the horizontal line test. (b) The function
                                f (x) = x3 is one-to-one because it passes the horizontal line
                                   test.

Finding a Function's Inverse

We can now consider one-to-one functions and show how to find their inverses. Recall that a function maps elements in
the domain of f to elements in the range of f . The inverse function maps each element from the range of f back to its
corresponding element from the domain of f . Therefore, to find the inverse function of a one-to-one function f , given
any y in the range of f , we need to determine which x in the domain of f satisfies f (x) = y. Since f is one-to-one,
there is exactly one such value x. We can find that value x by solving the equation f (x) = y for x. Doing so, we are
able to write x as a function of y where the domain of this function is the range of f and the range of this new function
is the domain of f . Consequently, this function is the inverse of f , and we write x = f -1(y). Since we typically use the
variable x to denote the independent variable and y to denote the dependent variable, we often interchange the roles of x
and y, and write y = f -1(x). Representing the inverse function in this way is also helpful later when we graph a function
 f and its inverse f -1 on the same axes.

  Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding an Inverse Function
       1. Solve the equation y = f (x) for x.

       2. Interchange the variables x and y and write y = f -1(x).

    Example 1.29

      Finding an Inverse Function

    Find the inverse for the function f (x) = 3x - 4. State the domain and range of the inverse function. Verify that
     f -1( f (x)) = x.

    Solution
    Follow the steps outlined in the strategy.

    Step 1. If y = 3x - 4, then 3x = y + 4 and x = 1y + 4.
                                                               33

    Step 2. Rewrite as y = 1x + 4 and let y = f -1 (x).
                               33

    Therefore, f -1 (x) = 1x + 4.
                              33

    Since the domain of f is (-, ), the range of f -1 is (-, ). Since the range of f is (-, ), the
    domain of f -1 is (-, ).

    You can verify that f -1( f (x)) = x by writing

    f -1( f (x)) = f -1(3x - 4) = 1(3x - 4) + 4 = x - 4 + 4 = x.3                 3
                                                                                     33

    Note that for f -1(x) to be the inverse of f (x), both f -1( f (x)) = x and f ( f -1(x)) = x for all x in the domain

1.24 Find the inverse of the function f (x) = 3x/(x - 2). State the domain and range of the inverse function.

Graphing Inverse Functions
Let's consider the relationship between the graph of a function f and the graph of its inverse. Consider the graph of f
shown in Figure 1.39 and a point (a, b) on the graph. Since b = f (a), then f -1 (b) = a. Therefore, when we graph
 f -1, the point (b, a) is on the graph. As a result, the graph of f -1 is a reflection of the graph of f about the line
y = x.

               Figure 1.39 (a) The graph of this function f shows point (a, b) on the graph of f . (b)
               Since (a, b) is on the graph of f , the point (b, a) is on the graph of f -1. The graph of
                f -1 is a reflection of the graph of f about the line y = x.

    Solution

    Reflect the graph about the line y = x. The domain of f -1 is [0, ). The range of f -1 is [-2, ). By using
    the preceding strategy for finding inverse functions, we can verify that the inverse function is f -1 (x) = x2 - 2,
    as shown in the graph.

        1.25 Sketch the graph of f (x) = 2x + 3 and the graph of its inverse using the symmetry property of inverse
        functions.

Restricting Domains

As we have seen, f (x) = x2 does not have an inverse function because it is not one-to-one. However, we can choose a
subset of the domain of f such that the function is one-to-one. This subset is called a restricted domain. By restricting the
domain of f , we can define a new function g such that the domain of g is the restricted domain of f and g(x) = f (x)
for all x in the domain of g. Then we can define an inverse function for g on that domain. For example, since f (x) = x2
is one-to-one on the interval [0, ), we can define a new function g such that the domain of g is [0, ) and g(x) = x2
for all x in its domain. Since g is a one-to-one function, it has an inverse function, given by the formula g-1(x) = x. On
the other hand, the function f (x) = x2 is also one-to-one on the domain (-, 0]. Therefore, we could also define a new
function h such that the domain of h is (-, 0] and h(x) = x2 for all x in the domain of h. Then h is a one-to-one
function and must also have an inverse. Its inverse is given by the formula h-1(x) = - x (Figure 1.40).

  Restricting the Domain
  Consider the function f (x) = (x + 1)2.

      a. Sketch the graph of f and use the horizontal line test to show that f is not one-to-one.
      b. Show that f is one-to-one on the restricted domain [-1, ). Determine the domain and range for the

           inverse of f on this restricted domain and find a formula for f -1.
  Solution

      a. The graph of f is the graph of y = x2 shifted left 1 unit. Since there exists a horizontal line intersecting
           the graph more than once, f is not one-to-one.

      b. On the interval [-1, ), f is one-to-one.

    The domain and range of f -1 are given by the range and domain of f , respectively. Therefore, the
    domain of f -1 is [0, ) and the range of f -1 is [-1, ). To find a formula for f -1, solve the
    equation y = (x + 1)2 for x. If y = (x + 1)2, then x = -1 ± y. Since we are restricting the domain
    to the interval where x  -1, we need ± y  0. Therefore, x = -1 + y. Interchanging x and y,
    we write y = -1 + x and conclude that f -1 (x) = -1 + x.

    Determine the domain and range of the inverse of f and find a formula for f -1.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions

The six basic trigonometric functions are periodic, and therefore they are not one-to-one. However, if we restrict the domain

of a trigonometric function to an interval where it is one-to-one, we can define its inverse. Consider the sine function

(Figure 1.34). The sine function is one-to-one on an infinite number of intervals, but the standard convention is to restrict

the domain to the interval  -  ,   .  By doing so, we define the inverse sine function on the domain     [-1,  1]       such that

                                    
                            22

for any x in the interval [-1, 1],    the inverse sine function tells us which angle    in the interval  -  ,           satisfies

                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                         22

sin  = x. Similarly, we can restrict the domains of the other trigonometric functions to define inverse trigonometric

functions, which are functions that tell us which angle in a certain interval has a specified trigonometric value.

    Definition

    The inverse sine function, denoted sin-1 or arcsin, and the inverse cosine function, denoted cos-1 or arccos, are

    defined on the domain D = {x| - 1  x  1} as follows:

                                  sin-1 (x) = y if and only if sin(y) = x and -   y  ;2  2           (1.12)

The inverse tangent function, denoted tan-1 or arctan, and inverse cotangent function, denoted cot-1 or arccot, are
defined on the domain D = {x| -  < x < } as follows:

                                  tan-1 (x) = y if and only if tan(y) = x and -  < y < ;22           (1.13)

The inverse cosecant function, denoted csc-1 or arccsc, and inverse secant function, denoted  sec-1  or arcsec, are
                                                                                                             (1.14)

To graph the inverse trigonometric functions, we use the graphs of the trigonometric functions restricted to the domains
defined earlier and reflect the graphs about the line y = x (Figure 1.41).

 Figure 1.41 The graph of each of the inverse trigonometric functions is a reflection about the line y = x of
 the corresponding restricted trigonometric function.

and their inverses.

When evaluating an inverse trigonometric function, the output is an angle. For example, to evaluate               cos-1 1,       2  we need to

                                                                                                                          

find an angle  such that cos  = 1. Clearly, many angles have this property. However, given the definition of cos-1, we
                                       2

need the angle       that not only solves this equation, but also lies in the interval      [0,   ].  We conclude that        cos-1 1 =  .

                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                    23

We now consider a composition of a trigonometric function and its inverse. For example, consider the two expressions

    -1        22     and  sin-1(sin()).     For the first one, we simplify as follows:
sinsin          

                                                       -1           2 = sin  =       2.
                                                   sin sin
                                                     2  4 2

For the second one, we have

                                                   sin-1 sin() = sin-1 (0) = 0.

The inverse function is supposed to "undo" the original function, so why isn't sin-1 sin() =  ? Recalling our definition

of inverse functions, a function         f  and its inverse   f -1  satisfy the conditions  f     -1        =  y  for all  y  in the domain of

                                                                                               f      (y)

f -1  and  f  -1     (x)  =  x  for all  x  in the domain of  f,    so what happened here? The issue is that the inverse sine function,

                  f

sin-1,  is the inverse of the restricted sine function defined on the domain                -  ,   .  Therefore, for          x     in the interval

                                                                                                    
                                                                                               22

-  ,   ,   it is true that   sin-1 (sin x)  =  x.  However, for values of         x  outside this interval, the equation does not hold, even

        
    22

though sin-1(sin x) is defined for all real numbers x.

What about sin(sin-1 y) ? Does that have a similar issue? The answer is no. Since the domain of sin-1 is the interval

[-1, 1], we conclude that sin(sin-1 y) = y if -1  y  1 and the expression is not defined for other values of y. To
summarize,

                                                   sin(sin-1 y) = y if -1  y  1

and                                                sin-1 (sin x) = x if -   x   . 2  2
Similarly, for the cosine function,

                                                   cos(cos-1 y) = y if -1  y  1

and

                                                   cos-1 (cos x) = x if 0  x  .

Similar properties hold for the other trigonometric functions and their inverses.

Solution

a.  Evaluating                    -1         is equivalent to finding the angle              such that sin  = - 3/2 and
                  sin - 3/2                  angle  = -/3 satisfies these                    two conditions. Therefore,

    -/2    /2. The

    si  n  -1                     =  -/3.

               -  3/2

b. First we use the fact that                           t  an  -1      /      =  -/6.  Then  tan(/6) = -1/ 3.  Therefore,

                                                                   -1     3

            -1                       
    tantan -1/ 3 = -1/ 3.

c. To evaluate cos-1 cos(5/4), first use the fact that cos(5/4) = - 2/2. Then we need to find the

    angle  such that cos() = - 2/2 and 0    . Since 3/4 satisfies both these conditions, we have

    coscos -1                          =  coscos -1          

                  (5/4)                              -  2/2 = 3/4.

d. Since cos(2/3) = -1/2, we need to evaluate sin-1 (-1/2). That is, we need to find the angle  such
    that sin() = -1/2 and -/2    /2. Since -/6 satisfies both these conditions, we can conclude

    that sin-1 (cos(2/3)) = sin-1 (-1/2) = -/6.

    The Maximum Value of a Function

    In many areas of science, engineering, and mathematics, it is useful to know the maximum value a function can obtain,
    even if we don't know its exact value at a given instant. For instance, if we have a function describing the strength
    of a roof beam, we would want to know the maximum weight the beam can support without breaking. If we have a
    function that describes the speed of a train, we would want to know its maximum speed before it jumps off the rails.
    Safe design often depends on knowing maximum values.

    This project describes a simple example of a function with a maximum value that depends on two equation coefficients.
    We will see that maximum values can depend on several factors other than the independent variable x.

        1. Consider the graph in Figure 1.42 of the function y = sin x + cos x. Describe its overall shape. Is it periodic?
             How do you know?

        Using a graphing calculator or other graphing device, estimate the x - and y -values of the maximum point for
        the graph (the first such point where x > 0). It may be helpful to express the x -value as a multiple of .
    2. Now consider other graphs of the form y = A sin x + B cos x for various values of A and B. Sketch the graph
        when A = 2 and B = 1, and find the x - and y-values for the maximum point. (Remember to express the x-value
         as a multiple of , if possible.) Has it moved?
    3. Repeat for A = 1, B = 2. Is there any relationship to what you found in part (2)?

    1.5.1 Identify the form of an exponential function.

    1.5.2  Explain the difference between the graphs of xb and bx.
           Recognize the significance of the number e.
    1.5.3  Identify the form of a logarithmic function.

    1.5.5  Identify the hyperbolic functions, their graphs, and basic identities.
    1.5.6
    1.5.7

In this section we examine exponential and logarithmic functions. We use the properties of these functions to solve
equations involving exponential or logarithmic terms, and we study the meaning and importance of the number e. We also
define hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, which involve combinations of exponential and logarithmic functions.
(Note that we present alternative definitions of exponential and logarithmic functions in the chapter Applications of
Integrations, and prove that the functions have the same properties with either definition.)

Exponential Functions

Exponential functions arise in many applications. One common example is population growth.

For example, if a population starts with P0 individuals and then grows at an annual rate of 2%, its population after 1 year
is

                                 P(1) = P0 + 0.02P0 = P0(1 + 0.02) = P0(1.02).

Its population after 2 years is

                                       P(2) = P(1) + 0.02P(1) = P(1)(1.02) = P0 (1.02)2.

In general, its population after t years is

                                                           P(t) = P0 (1.02)t,

which is an exponential function. More generally, any function of the form f (x) = bx, where b > 0, b  1, is an
exponential function with base b and exponent x. Exponential functions have constant bases and variable exponents. Note
that a function of the form f (x) = xb for some constant b is not an exponential function but a power function.

To see the difference between an exponential function and a power function, we compare the functions y = x2 and y = 2x.

In Table 1.10, we see that both 2x and x2 approach infinity as x  . Eventually, however, 2x becomes larger than
x2 and grows more rapidly as x  . In the opposite direction, as x  -, x2  , whereas 2x  0. The line
y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote for y = 2x.

In Figure 1.43, we graph both y = x2 and y = 2x to show how the graphs differ.

Evaluating Exponential Functions

Recall the properties of exponents: If x is a positive integer, then we define bx = b · b  b (with x factors of b). If x
is a negative integer, then x = -y for some positive integer y, and we define bx = b-y = 1/by. Also, b0 is defined
to be 1. If x is a rational number, then x = p/q, where p and q are integers and bx = b p/q = q b p. For example,

93/2 = 93 = 27. However, how is bx defined if x is an irrational number? For example, what do we mean by 2 2 ?
This is too complex a question for us to answer fully right now; however, we can make an approximation. In Table 1.11,
we list some rational numbers approaching 2, and the values of 2x for each rational number x are presented as well.
We claim that if we choose rational numbers x getting closer and closer to 2, the values of 2x get closer and closer to

some number L. We define that number L to be 2 2.

  Bacterial Growth

  Suppose a particular population of bacteria is known to double in size every 4 hours. If a culture starts with
  1000 bacteria, the number of bacteria after 4 hours is n(4) = 1000 · 2. The number of bacteria after 8 hours is
  n(8) = n(4) · 2 = 1000 · 22. In general, the number of bacteria after 4m hours is n(4m) = 1000 · 2m. Letting
98                                                                                Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

      t = 4m, we see that the number of bacteria after t hours is n(t) = 1000 · 2t/4. Find the number of bacteria
     after 6 hours, 10 hours, and 24 hours.

     Solution
     The number of bacteria after 6 hours is given by n(6) = 1000 · 26/4  2828 bacteria. The number of bacteria
     after 10 hours is given by n(10) = 1000 · 210/4  5657 bacteria. The number of bacteria after 24 hours is
     given by n(24) = 1000 · 26 = 64,000 bacteria.

Graphing Exponential Functions
For any base b > 0, b  1, the exponential function f (x) = bx is defined for all real numbers x and bx > 0. Therefore,
the domain of f (x) = bx is (-, ) and the range is (0, ). To graph bx, we note that for b > 1, bx is increasing
on (-, ) and bx   as x  , whereas bx  0 as x  -. On the other hand, if 0 < b < 1, f (x) = bx is
decreasing on (-, ) and bx  0 as x   whereas bx   as x  - (Figure 1.44).

                                Figure 1.44 If b > 1, then bx is increasing on (-, ).
                                If 0 < b < 1, then bx is decreasing on (-, ).

The Number e

A special type of exponential function appears frequently in real-world applications. To describe it, consider the following
example of exponential growth, which arises from compounding interest in a savings account. Suppose a person invests P
dollars in a savings account with an annual interest rate r, compounded annually. The amount of money after 1 year is

                                             A(1) = P + rP = P(1 + r).

The amount of money after 2 years is

                                  A(2) = A(1) + rA(1) = P(1 + r) + rP(1 + r) = P(1 + r)2.

More generally, the amount after t years is

                                             A(t) = P(1 + r)t.
100                                                                                                   Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

If the money is compounded 2 times per year, the amount of money after half a year is

                                              1       r                            r 
                                              A2 = P + 2P = P1 + 2.

The amount of money after 1 year is

            A(1) = A1 + r A1 = P1 + r  + r P1 + r  = P1 + r 2.
                       2 2 2  2 2  2  2

After t years, the amount of money in the account is

                                                 A(t) = P1 + r 2t.
                                                                 2

More generally, if the money is compounded n times per year, the amount of money in the account after t years is given
by the function

                                                            r nt
                                                 A(t) = P1 + n .

What happens as n   ? To answer this question, we let m = n/r and write

                                                  r nt  1 mrt
                                                 1 + n = 1 + m ,

and examine the behavior of (1 + 1/m)m as m  , using a table of values (Table 1.12).

     m      10                           100          1000                        10,000   100,000    1,000,000

                                 1 m
     Table 1.12 Values of 1 + m as m  

Looking at this table, it appears that (1 + 1/m)m is approaching a number between 2.7 and 2.8 as m  . In fact,
(1 + 1/m)m does approach some number as m  . We call this number e . To six decimal places of accuracy,

                                                      e  2.718282.

The letter e was first used to represent this number by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler during the 1720s. Although
Euler did not discover the number, he showed many important connections between e and logarithmic functions. We still
use the notation e today to honor Euler's work because it appears in many areas of mathematics and because we can use it
in many practical applications.

Returning to our savings account example, we can conclude that if a person puts P dollars in an account at an annual
interest rate r, compounded continuously, then A(t) = Pert. This function may be familiar. Since functions involving
base e arise often in applications, we call the function f (x) = ex the natural exponential function. Not only is this

function interesting because of the definition of the number e, but also, as discussed next, its graph has an important
property.

Since e > 1, we know ex is increasing on (-, ). In Figure 1.45, we show a graph of f (x) = ex along with a

tangent line to the graph of at x = 0. We give a precise definition of tangent line in the next chapter; but, informally, we

say a tangent line to a graph of  f  at  x=a  is a line that passes through the point          f (a)  and has the same "slope" as

                                                                                           a,

f at that point . The function f (x) = ex is the only exponential function bx with tangent line at x = 0 that has a slope

of 1. As we see later in the text, having this property makes the natural exponential function the most simple exponential

function to use in many instances.

   Example 1.35

     Compounding Interest

     Suppose $500 is invested in an account at an annual interest rate of r = 5.5%, compounded continuously.
          a. Let t denote the number of years after the initial investment and A(t) denote the amount of money in
               the account at time t. Find a formula for A(t).
          b. Find the amount of money in the account after 10 years and after 20 years.

     Solution
          a. If P dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate r, compounded continuously, then
               A(t) = Pert. Here P = $500 and r = 0.055. Therefore, A(t) = 500e0.055t.
          b. After 10 years, the amount of money in the account is
                                                A(10) = 500e0.055 · 10 = 500e0.55  $866.63.

               After 20 years, the amount of money in the account is
                                               A(20) = 500e0.055 · 20 = 500e1.1  $1, 502.08.

        1.29 If $750 is invested in an account at an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded continuously, find a
        formula for the amount of money in the account after t years. Find the amount of money after 30 years.

Logarithmic Functions

Using our understanding of exponential functions, we can discuss their inverses, which are the logarithmic functions. These
come in handy when we need to consider any phenomenon that varies over a wide range of values, such as pH in chemistry
or decibels in sound levels.
The exponential function f (x) = bx is one-to-one, with domain (-, ) and range (0, ). Therefore, it has an inverse
function, called the logarithmic function with base b. For any b > 0, b  1, the logarithmic function with base b,
denoted logb, has domain (0, ) and range (-, ), and satisfies

                                                  logb (x) = y if and only if by = x.
For example,
102                                                                                                                  Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

     log2(8) = 3                 since                                            23 = 8,
           1                     since
                                 since                                            10-2 = 1 = 1 ,
     log10   = -2                                                                           102 100
             100
                                                                                  b0 = 1 for any base b > 0.
     logb(1) = 0

Furthermore, since y = logb(x) and y = bx are inverse functions,

                                                    logb (bx) = x and blogb (x) = x.

The most commonly used logarithmic function is the function loge. Since this function uses natural e as its base, it is
called the natural logarithm. Here we use the notation ln(x) or ln x to mean loge (x). For example,

     ln(e)  =  loge  (e)  =  1,     3  =  loge   3                                =  3,  ln(1)  =  loge  (1)  =  0.

                                 lne            e 

Since the functions f (x) = ex and g(x) = ln(x) are inverses of each other,

                                                        ln(ex) = x and eln x = x,
and their graphs are symmetric about the line y = x (Figure 1.46).

                                   Figure 1.46 The functions y = ex and y = ln(x) are
                                       inverses of each other, so their graphs are symmetric about the
                                   line y = x.

       At this site (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_logscale) you can see an example of a base-10 logarithmic scale.

In general, for any base b > 0, b  1, the function g(x) = logb(x) is symmetric about the line y = x with the function
 f (x) = bx. Using this fact and the graphs of the exponential functions, we graph functions logb for several values of
b > 1 (Figure 1.47).

Before solving some equations involving exponential and logarithmic functions, let's review the basic properties of
logarithms.

Rule: Properties of Logarithms

If a, b, c > 0, b  1, and r is any real number, then

                                  1. logb (ac) = logb (a) + logb (c)          (Product property)

                                  2.  logb  c  =  logb  (a)  -  logb  (c)     (Power property)

                                  3. logb (ar) = rlogb (a)

Example 1.36

  Solving Equations Involving Exponential Functions

Solve each of the following equations for x.
    a. 5x = 2
    b. ex + 6e-x = 5

Solution
    a. Applying the natural logarithm function to both sides of the equation, we have
                                                              ln5x = ln 2.

Using the power property of logarithms,

                                                                x ln5 = ln2.

    Therefore, x = ln 2/ln 5.
b. Multiplying both sides of the equation by ex, we arrive at the equation

                                                        e2x + 6 = 5ex.
104                                                                                                    Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

         Rewriting this equation as

                                                      e2x - 5ex + 6 = 0,

         we can then rewrite it as a quadratic equation in ex :
                                                        (ex)2 - 5(ex) + 6 = 0.

         Now we can solve the quadratic equation. Factoring this equation, we obtain
                                                        (ex - 3)(ex - 2) = 0.

         Therefore, the solutions satisfy ex = 3 and ex = 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives us
         the solutions x = ln 3, ln 2.

     1.30 Solve e2x /(3 + e2x) = 1/2.

     c.  ln(2x)  -  3     2  =  0

                       lnx 

     Solution
         a. By the definition of the natural logarithm function,

                                         1            =  4  if  and               only  if  e4  =  1.
                                       ln x                                                        x

         Therefore, the solution is x = 1/e4.
     b. Using the product and power properties of logarithmic functions, rewrite the left-hand side of the equation

         as

                                    log10 x + log10 x = log10 x x = log10 x3/2 = 3log10 x.
                                                                                            2

         Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as

                                                   23log10 x = 2 or log10 x = 4.                3

      The solution is x = 104/3 = 103 10.

c.    Using the power property of logarithmic functions, we can rewrite the equation as  ln(2x)  -       6  =  0.
                                                                                                          
                                                                                                    lnx

      Using the quotient property, this becomes

                                                        2
                                                      ln 5 = 0.

                                                          x

      Therefore, 2/x5 = 1, which implies x = 5 2. We should then check for any extraneous solutions.

When evaluating a logarithmic function with a calculator, you may have noticed that the only options are log10 or log,
called the common logarithm, or ln, which is the natural logarithm. However, exponential functions and logarithm functions
can be expressed in terms of any desired base b. If you need to use a calculator to evaluate an expression with a different
base, you can apply the change-of-base formulas first. Using this change of base, we typically write a given exponential or
logarithmic function in terms of the natural exponential and natural logarithmic functions.

  Rule: Change-of-Base Formulas
  Let a > 0, b > 0, and a  1, b  1.

       1. ax = bxlogb a for any real number x.
           If b = e, this equation reduces to ax = exloge a = exlna.

       2. loga x = log logb x for any real number b a x > 0.
           If b = e, this equation reduces to loga x = ln x.
                                                                ln a

Proof
For the first change-of-base formula, we begin by making use of the power property of logarithmic functions. We know that
for any base b > 0, b  1, logb(ax) = xlogb a. Therefore,

                                                          blogb(a x) = b xlogb a.
In addition, we know that bx and logb(x) are inverse functions. Therefore,

                                                              blogb(a x) = a x.
Combining these last two equalities, we conclude that ax = bxlogb a.
To prove the second property, we show that

                                                      (logb a) · (loga x) = logb x.
Let u = logb a, v = loga x, and w = logb x. We will show that u · v = w. By the definition of logarithmic functions, we
106                                                                                         Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

know that bu = a, av = x, and bw = x. From the previous equations, we see that
                                                      buv = (bu)v = av = x = bw.

Therefore, buv = bw. Since exponential functions are one-to-one, we can conclude that u · v = w.

       Chapter Opener: The Richter Scale for Earthquakes

                                     Figure 1.48 (credit: modification of work by Robb
                                     Hannawacker, NPS)

     In 1935, Charles Richter developed a scale (now known as the Richter scale) to measure the magnitude of an
     earthquake. The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as follows: Consider one earthquake
     with magnitude R1 on the Richter scale and a second earthquake with magnitude R2 on the Richter scale.
     Suppose R1 > R2, which means the earthquake of magnitude R1 is stronger, but how much stronger is it than
     the other earthquake? A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure
     the amplitude of the earthquake waves. If A1 is the amplitude measured for the first earthquake and A2 is the
     amplitude measured for the second earthquake, then the amplitudes and magnitudes of the two earthquakes satisfy
     the following equation:

                                                                     A1
                                                  R1 - R2 = log10 A .

                                                                                                   2

     Consider an earthquake that measures 8 on the Richter scale and an earthquake that measures 7 on the Richter
     scale. Then,

                                                              A1
                                               8 - 7 = log10 A .

                                                                                            2

Therefore,

                                                       A1
                                                 log10 A  = 1,

                                                                                 2

which implies A1 /A2 = 10 or A1 = 10A2. Since A1 is 10 times the size of A2, we say that the first
earthquake is 10 times as intense as the second earthquake. On the other hand, if one earthquake measures 8 on
the Richter scale and another measures 6, then the relative intensity of the two earthquakes satisfies the equation

                                                   A1
                                            log10 A  = 8 - 6 = 2.

                                                                            2

Therefore, A1 = 100A2. That is, the first earthquake is 100 times more intense than the second earthquake.
How can we use logarithmic functions to compare the relative severity of the magnitude 9 earthquake in Japan in
2011 with the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in Haiti in 2010?

Solution
To compare the Japan and Haiti earthquakes, we can use an equation presented earlier:

                 A1
9 - 7.3 = log10 A .

                             2

Therefore, A1 /A2 = 101.7, and we conclude that the earthquake in Japan was approximately 50 times more
intense than the earthquake in Haiti.

        1.33 Compare the relative severity of a magnitude 8.4 earthquake with a magnitude 7.4 earthquake.

Hyperbolic Functions

The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of certain combinations of ex and e-x. These functions arise naturally
in various engineering and physics applications, including the study of water waves and vibrations of elastic membranes.
Another common use for a hyperbolic function is the representation of a hanging chain or cable, also known as a catenary
(Figure 1.49). If we introduce a coordinate system so that the low point of the chain lies along the y -axis, we can describe
the height of the chain in terms of a hyperbolic function. First, we define the hyperbolic functions.

                      shape applies to a chain or cable hanging from two supports with

The name cosh rhymes with "gosh," whereas the name sinh is pronounced "cinch." Tanh, sech, csch, and coth are
pronounced "tanch," "seech," "coseech," and "cotanch," respectively.

Using the definition of cosh(x) and principles of physics, it can be shown that the height of a hanging chain, such as the
one in Figure 1.49, can be described by the function h(x) = a cosh(x/a) + c for certain constants a and c.

But why are these functions called hyperbolic functions? To answer this question, consider the quantity cosh2 t - sinh2 t.
Using the definition of cosh and sinh, we see that

(x, y) = (cosh t, sinh t) lies on the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = 1 (Figure 1.50).

Graphs of Hyperbolic Functions

To graph cosh x and sinh x, we make use of the fact that both functions approach (1/2)ex as x  , since e-x  0
as x  . As x  -, cosh x approaches 1/2e-x, whereas sinh x approaches -1/2e-x. Therefore, using the graphs
of 1/2ex, 1/2e-x, and -1/2e-x as guides, we graph cosh x and sinh x. To graph tanh x, we use the fact that
tanh(0) = 0, -1 < tanh(x) < 1 for all x, tanh x  1 as x  , and tanh x  -1 as x  -. The graphs of the
other three hyperbolic functions can be sketched using the graphs of cosh x, sinh x, and tanh x (Figure 1.51).

Evaluating Hyperbolic Functions

    b. If sinh x = 3/4, find the values of the remaining five hyperbolic functions.

Solution

a. Using the definition of the sinh function, we write

                                                         5ln x -5ln x     5                -5        5 -5
                                                                       lnx              lnx 
                                  sinh(5ln x) = e - e                  = e -e                  = x -x .
                                                               2                     2                 2

b. Using the identity cosh2 x - sinh2 x = 1, we see that

                                                                 2 32 25
                                                            cosh x = 1 +   = .

                                                                              4 16

Since cosh x  1 for all x, we must have cosh x = 5/4. Then, using the definitions for the other
hyperbolic functions, we conclude that tanh x = 3/5, csch x = 4/3, sech x = 4/5, and coth x = 5/3.

1.34 Simplify cosh(2 ln x).

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

From the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, we see that all of them are one-to-one except cosh x and sech x. If we
restrict the domains of these two functions to the interval [0, ), then all the hyperbolic functions are one-to-one, and we
can define the inverse hyperbolic functions. Since the hyperbolic functions themselves involve exponential functions, the
inverse hyperbolic functions involve logarithmic functions.

Let's look at how to derive the first equation. The others follow similarly. Suppose y = sinh-1 x. Then, x = sinh y and,
by the definition of the hyperbolic sine function, x = ey - e-y. Therefore,

                                                                  2
                                                           ey - 2x - e-y = 0.
Multiplying this equation by ey, we obtain

                                                          e2y - 2xey - 1 = 0.
This can be solved like a quadratic equation, with the solution

                                   ey = 2x ± 4x2 + 4 = x ± x2 + 1.
                                                 2

Since ey > 0, the only solution is the one with the positive sign. Applying the natural logarithm to both sides of the
equation, we conclude that

                                                                                  2

KEY CONCEPTS

1.1 Review of Functions

· A function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs with exactly one output for each input.
· If no domain is stated for a function y = f (x), the domain is considered to be the set of all real numbers x for

   which the function is defined.
· When sketching the graph of a function f , each vertical line may intersect the graph, at most, once.

· A function may have any number of zeros, but it has, at most, one y-intercept.
· To define the composition g  f , the range of f must be contained in the domain of g.

· Even functions are symmetric about the y -axis whereas odd functions are symmetric about the origin.

1.2 Basic Classes of Functions

     · The power function f (x) = xn is an even function if n is even and n  0, and it is an odd function if n is odd.

     · The root function f (x) = x1/n has the domain [0, ) if n is even and the domain (-, ) if n is odd. If n
         is odd, then f (x) = x1/n is an odd function.

     · The domain of the rational function f (x) = p(x)/q(x), where p(x) and q(x) are polynomial functions, is the set
         of x such that q(x)  0.

     · Functions that involve the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers are
         algebraic functions. All other functions are transcendental. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions
         are examples of transcendental functions.

     · A polynomial function f with degree n  1 satisfies f (x)  ± as x  ±. The sign of the output as
         x   depends on the sign of the leading coefficient only and on whether n is even or odd.

     · Vertical and horizontal shifts, vertical and horizontal scalings, and reflections about the x - and y -axes are
         examples of transformations of functions.

1.3 Trigonometric Functions

     · Radian measure is defined such that the angle associated with the arc of length 1 on the unit circle has radian
         measure 1. An angle with a degree measure of 180° has a radian measure of  rad.
120                                                                                                          Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs

     · For acute angles , the values of the trigonometric functions are defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle
        in which one of the acute angles is .

     · For a general angle , let (x, y) be a point on a circle of radius r corresponding to this angle . The
        trigonometric functions can be written as ratios involving x, y, and r.

     · The trigonometric functions are periodic. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have period 2. The
        tangent and cotangent functions have period .

1.4 Inverse Functions

     · For a function to have an inverse, the function must be one-to-one. Given the graph of a function, we can determine
        whether the function is one-to-one by using the horizontal line test.

     · If a function is not one-to-one, we can restrict the domain to a smaller domain where the function is one-to-one and
        then define the inverse of the function on the smaller domain.

     ·  For a function  f  and its inverse  f -1,  f     -1        =  x  for all  x  in the domain of  f -1  and  f  -1     (x)  =  x  for all

                                                      f      (x)                                                         f

        x in the domain of f .

     · Since the trigonometric functions are periodic, we need to restrict their domains to define the inverse trigonometric
        functions.

     · The graph of a function f and its inverse f -1 are symmetric about the line y = x.

1.5 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

     · The exponential function y = bx is increasing if b > 1 and decreasing if 0 < b < 1. Its domain is (-, )
         and its range is (0, ).

     · The logarithmic function y = logb(x) is the inverse of y = bx. Its domain is (0, ) and its range is (-, ).
     · The natural exponential function is y = ex and the natural logarithmic function is y = ln x = loge x.

     · Given an exponential function or logarithmic function in base a, we can make a change of base to convert this
         function to any base b > 0, b  1. We typically convert to base e.

     · The hyperbolic functions involve combinations of the exponential functions ex and e-x. As a result, the inverse
         hyperbolic functions involve the natural logarithm.

Introduction

Science fiction writers often imagine spaceships that can travel to far-off planets in distant galaxies. However, back in 1905,
Albert Einstein showed that a limit exists to how fast any object can travel. The problem is that the faster an object moves,
the more mass it attains (in the form of energy), according to the equation

                                                              m = m0 ,
                                                                     1 - v2 c2
124  Chapter 2 | Limits

where m0 is the object's mass at rest, v is its speed, and c is the speed of light. What is this speed limit? (We explore this
problem further in Example 2.12.)

The idea of a limit is central to all of calculus. We begin this chapter by examining why limits are so important. Then, we
go on to describe how to find the limit of a function at a given point. Not all functions have limits at all points, and we
discuss what this means and how we can tell if a function does or does not have a limit at a particular value. This chapter has
been created in an informal, intuitive fashion, but this is not always enough if we need to prove a mathematical statement
involving limits. The last section of this chapter presents the more precise definition of a limit and shows how to prove
whether a function has a limit.

         2.1.1 Describe the tangent problem and how it led to the idea of a derivative.
         2.1.2 Explain how the idea of a limit is involved in solving the tangent problem.
         2.1.3 Recognize a tangent to a curve at a point as the limit of secant lines.
         2.1.4 Identify instantaneous velocity as the limit of average velocity over a small time interval.
         2.1.5 Describe the area problem and how it was solved by the integral.
         2.1.6 Explain how the idea of a limit is involved in solving the area problem.
         2.1.7 Recognize how the ideas of limit, derivative, and integral led to the studies of infinite series
         and multivariable calculus.

As we embark on our study of calculus, we shall see how its development arose from common solutions to practical
problems in areas such as engineering physics--like the space travel problem posed in the chapter opener. Two key
problems led to the initial formulation of calculus: (1) the tangent problem, or how to determine the slope of a line tangent
to a curve at a point; and (2) the area problem, or how to determine the area under a curve.

The Tangent Problem and Differential Calculus

Rate of change is one of the most critical concepts in calculus. We begin our investigation of rates of change by looking at
the graphs of the three lines f (x) = -2x - 3, g(x) = 1x + 1, and h(x) = 2, shown in Figure 2.2.

                                                              2

Figure 2.2 The rate of change of a linear function is constant in each of these three graphs, with the constant determined by the
slope.

As we move from left to right along the graph of f (x) = -2x - 3, we see that the graph decreases at a constant rate. For
every 1 unit we move to the right along the x-axis, the y-coordinate decreases by 2 units. This rate of change is determined
by the slope (-2) of the line. Similarly, the slope of 1/2 in the function g(x) tells us that for every change in x of 1 unit
there is a corresponding change in y of 1/2 unit. The function h(x) = 2 has a slope of zero, indicating that the values of the
function remain constant. We see that the slope of each linear function indicates the rate of change of the function.

Compare the graphs of these three functions with the graph of k(x) = x2 (Figure 2.3). The graph of k(x) = x2 starts from

the left by decreasing rapidly, then begins to decrease more slowly and level off, and then finally begins to increase--slowly
at first, followed by an increasing rate of increase as it moves toward the right. Unlike a linear function, no single number
represents the rate of change for this function. We quite naturally ask: How do we measure the rate of change of a nonlinear
function?

                    Figure 2.3 The function k(x) = x2 does not have a constant
                    rate of change.

We can approximate the rate of change of a function  f (x)  at a point      f (a)  on its graph by taking another point      f  (  x    

                                                                        a,                                               x,           )

on the graph of f (x), drawing a line through the two points, and calculating the slope of the resulting line. Such a line is

called a secant line. Figure 2.4 shows a secant line to a function  f (x)   at a point      f (a).

                                                                                        a,

The secant to the function  f (x)  through the points      f (a)  and      f  (  x      is the line passing through these points. Its

                                                       a,              x,           )

slope is given by

                                            f (x) - f (a)                                          (2.1)
                                   msec = x - a .

The accuracy of approximating the rate of change of the function with a secant line depends on how close x is to a. As we
see in Figure 2.5, if x is closer to a, the slope of the secant line is a better measure of the rate of change of f (x) at a.

                                       Figure 2.5 As x gets closer to a, the slope of the secant line
                                       becomes a better approximation to the rate of change of the
                                   function f (x) at a.

The secant lines themselves approach a line that is called the tangent to the function f (x) at a (Figure 2.6). The slope of
the tangent line to the graph at a measures the rate of change of the function at a. This value also represents the derivative of
the function f (x) at a, or the rate of change of the function at a. This derivative is denoted by f  (a). Differential calculus
is the field of calculus concerned with the study of derivatives and their applications.

Example 2.1 illustrates how to find slopes of secant lines. These slopes estimate the slope of the tangent line or,
equivalently, the rate of change of the function at the point at which the slopes are calculated.

   Example 2.1

     Finding Slopes of Secant Lines

Estimate the slope of the tangent line (rate of change) to f (x) = x2 at x = 1 by finding slopes of secant lines
through (1, 1) and each of the following points on the graph of f (x) = x2.

    a. (2, 4)
    b. 3, 9

         2 4

Solution
Use the formula for the slope of a secant line from the definition.

a. msec = 4 - 1 = 3
              2-1

b.  m sec           =  9 -14 = 5 = 2.5
                       3
                        2-1 2

The point in part b. is closer to the point (1, 1), so the slope of 2.5 is closer to the slope of the tangent line. A
good estimate for the slope of the tangent would be in the range of 2 to 2.5 (Figure 2.7).

We continue our investigation by exploring a related question. Keeping in mind that velocity may be thought of as the rate
of change of position, suppose that we have a function, s(t), that gives the position of an object along a coordinate axis

at any given time t. Can we use these same ideas to create a reasonable definition of the instantaneous velocity at a given
time t = a ? We start by approximating the instantaneous velocity with an average velocity. First, recall that the speed of
an object traveling at a constant rate is the ratio of the distance traveled to the length of time it has traveled. We define the
average velocity of an object over a time period to be the change in its position divided by the length of the time period.

Definition

Let s(t) be the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis at time t. The average velocity of the object over
a time interval [a, t] where a < t (or [t, a] if t < a) is

                                                       s(t) - s(a)                                 (2.2)
                                               vave = t - a .

As t is chosen closer to a, the average velocity becomes closer to the instantaneous velocity. Note that finding the average
velocity of a position function over a time interval is essentially the same as finding the slope of a secant line to a function.
Furthermore, to find the slope of a tangent line at a point a, we let the x-values approach a in the slope of the secant line.
Similarly, to find the instantaneous velocity at time a, we let the t-values approach a in the average velocity. This process
of letting x or t approach a in an expression is called taking a limit. Thus, we may define the instantaneous velocity as
follows.

Definition

For a position function s(t), the instantaneous velocity at a time t = a is the value that the average velocities
approach on intervals of the form [a, t] and [t, a] as the values of t become closer to a, provided such a value exists.

Example 2.2 illustrates this concept of limits and average velocity.

   Example 2.2

     Finding Average Velocity

     A rock is dropped from a height of 64 ft. It is determined that its height (in feet) above ground t seconds later (for
     0  t  2) is given by s(t) = -16t2 + 64. Find the average velocity of the rock over each of the given time
     intervals. Use this information to guess the instantaneous velocity of the rock at time t = 0.5.

     a.  0.49,          

                0.5

     b. 0.5, 0.51

     Solution
     Substitute the data into the formula for the definition of average velocity.

         a. vave = s(0.5) - s(0.49) 0.5 - 0.49 = -15.84

          b. vave = s(0.51) - s(0.5) 0.51 - 0.5 = -16.16
      The instantaneous velocity is somewhere between -15.84 and -16.16 ft/sec. A good guess might be -16 ft/sec.

        2.2 An object moves along a coordinate axis so that its position at time t is given by s(t) = t3. Estimate its
        instantaneous velocity at time t = 2 by computing its average velocity over the time interval [2, 2.001].

The Area Problem and Integral Calculus

We now turn our attention to a classic question from calculus. Many quantities in physics--for example, quantities of
work--may be interpreted as the area under a curve. This leads us to ask the question: How can we find the area between
the graph of a function and the x-axis over an interval (Figure 2.8)?

                                   Figure 2.8 The Area Problem: How do we find the area of the
                                   shaded region?

As in the answer to our previous questions on velocity, we first try to approximate the solution. We approximate the area by

dividing up the interval           into smaller intervals in the shape of rectangles. The approximation of the area comes from

                          a,  b

adding up the areas of these rectangles (Figure 2.9).

                                   Figure 2.9 The area of the region under the curve is
                                   approximated by summing the areas of thin rectangles.

As the widths of the rectangles become smaller (approach zero), the sums of the areas of the rectangles approach the area

between the graph of  f (x)   and the x-axis over the interval  a, b.  Once again, we find ourselves taking a limit. Limits

of this type serve as a basis for the definition of the definite integral. Integral calculus is the study of integrals and their

applications.

       Estimation Using Rectangles

                                   f (x) = x2 + 1 can be estimated using rectangles.

     Solution
     The areas of the three rectangles are 1 unit2, 2 unit2, and 5 unit2. Using these rectangles, our area estimate is 8
     unit2.

Other Aspects of Calculus

So far, we have studied functions of one variable only. Such functions can be represented visually using graphs in two
dimensions; however, there is no good reason to restrict our investigation to two dimensions. Suppose, for example, that
instead of determining the velocity of an object moving along a coordinate axis, we want to determine the velocity of a
rock fired from a catapult at a given time, or of an airplane moving in three dimensions. We might want to graph real-value
functions of two variables or determine volumes of solids of the type shown in Figure 2.11. These are only a few of the
types of questions that can be asked and answered using multivariable calculus. Informally, multivariable calculus can be
characterized as the study of the calculus of functions of two or more variables. However, before exploring these and other
ideas, we must first lay a foundation for the study of calculus in one variable by exploring the concept of a limit.

                                       Figure 2.11 We can use multivariable calculus to find the
                                       volume between a surface defined by a function of two variables
                                       and a plane.

The concept of a limit or limiting process, essential to the understanding of calculus, has been around for thousands of years.
In fact, early mathematicians used a limiting process to obtain better and better approximations of areas of circles. Yet, the
formal definition of a limit--as we know and understand it today--did not appear until the late 19th century. We therefore
begin our quest to understand limits, as our mathematical ancestors did, by using an intuitive approach. At the end of this
chapter, armed with a conceptual understanding of limits, we examine the formal definition of a limit.

We begin our exploration of limits by taking a look at the graphs of the functions

                    f (x) = x2 - 4, g(x) = |x - 2|, and h(x) = 1 ,
                    x-2  x-2             (x - 2)2

which are shown in Figure 2.12. In particular, let's focus our attention on the behavior of each graph at and around x = 2.

Figure 2.12 These graphs show the behavior of three different functions around x = 2.

Each of the three functions is undefined at x = 2, but if we make this statement and no other, we give a very incomplete
picture of how each function behaves in the vicinity of x = 2. To express the behavior of each graph in the vicinity of 2
more completely, we need to introduce the concept of a limit.

Intuitive Definition of a Limit

Let's first take a closer look at how the function f (x) = (x2 - 4)/(x - 2) behaves around x = 2 in Figure 2.12. As the
values of x approach 2 from either side of 2, the values of y = f (x) approach 4. Mathematically, we say that the limit of
 f (x) as x approaches 2 is 4. Symbolically, we express this limit as
136                                                                                                                     Chapter 2 | Limits

                                                               lim f (x) = 4.

                                                                              x2

From this very brief informal look at one limit, let's start to develop an intuitive definition of the limit. We can think of the
limit of a function at a number a as being the one real number L that the functional values approach as the x-values approach
a, provided such a real number L exists. Stated more carefully, we have the following definition:

Definition

Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a, with the possible exception of a itself,
and let L be a real number. If all values of the function f (x) approach the real number L as the values of x(  a)
approach the number a, then we say that the limit of f (x) as x approaches a is L. (More succinct, as x gets closer to a,
 f (x) gets closer and stays close to L.) Symbolically, we express this idea as

                               lim      f  (x)   =  L.                                                                  (2.3)

                               xa

We can estimate limits by constructing tables of functional values and by looking at their graphs. This process is described
in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Evaluating a Limit Using a Table of Functional Values

    1. To evaluate xlima f (x), we begin by completing a table of functional values. We should choose two sets of
         x-values--one set of values approaching a and less than a, and another set of values approaching a and greater
         than a. Table 2.1 demonstrates what your tables might look like.

            x           f (x)                                                     x                   f (x)

            a - 0.1     f (a - 0.1)                                               a + 0.1             f (a + 0.1)

            a - 0.01    f (a - 0.01)                                              a + 0.01            f (a + 0.01)

            a - 0.001   f (a - 0.001)                                             a + 0.001           f (a + 0.001)

            a - 0.0001  f (a - 0.0001)                                            a + 0.0001          f (a + 0.0001)

            Use additional values as necessary.                                   Use additional values as necessary.

            Table 2.1 Table of Functional Values for xlima f (x)

     2. Next, let's look at the values in each of the f (x) columns and determine whether the values seem to

         be approaching a single value as we move down each column. In our columns, we look at the sequence

         f (a - 0.1), f (a - 0.01), f (a - 0.001)., f (a - 0.0001),                            and    so           on,  and

         f (a + 0.1), f (a + 0.01), f (a + 0.001), f (a + 0.0001), and so on. (Note: Although we have chosen the

         x-values a ± 0.1, a ± 0.01, a ± 0.001, a ± 0.0001, and so forth, and these values will probably work nearly

         every time, on very rare occasions we may need to modify our choices.)

     3.  If both columns approach a common y-value L, we state                    lim  f  (x)  =  L.  We can use the following strategy to

                                                                                  xa

         confirm the result obtained from the table or as an alternative method for estimating a limit.

4. Using a graphing calculator or computer software that allows us graph functions, we can plot the function

f (x), making sure the functional values of f (x) for x-values near a are in our window. We can use the trace

feature to move along the graph of the function and watch the y-value readout as the x-values approach a. If

the y-values approach L as our x-values approach a from both directions, then        lim     f  (x)  =  L.  We may need

                                                                                     xa

to zoom in on our graph and repeat this process several times.

We apply this Problem-Solving Strategy to compute a limit in Example 2.4.

Note: The values in this table were obtained using a calculator and using all the places given in the calculator
output.

                            (sin x)
As we read down each x column, we see that the values in each column appear to be approaching one.

Thus, it is fairly reasonable to conclude that  lim      sin x       =  1.  A calculator or computer-generated graph of

           estimate from Table 2.2.

At this point, we see from Example 2.4 and Example 2.5 that it may be just as easy, if not easier, to estimate a limit of
a function by inspecting its graph as it is to estimate the limit by using a table of functional values. In Example 2.6, we
evaluate a limit exclusively by looking at a graph rather than by using a table of functional values.

   Example 2.6

     Evaluating a Limit Using a Graph
     For g(x) shown in Figure 2.15, evaluate lim g(x).

                                                                      x  -1

                                   Figure 2.15 The graph of g(x) includes one value not on a
                                       smooth curve.

     Solution
     Despite the fact that g(-1) = 4, as the x-values approach -1 from either side, the g(x) values approach 3.
     Therefore, lim g(x) = 3. Note that we can determine this limit without even knowing the algebraic expression

                        x  -1

      of the function.

Based on Example 2.6, we make the following observation: It is possible for the limit of a function to exist at a point, and
for the function to be defined at this point, but the limit of the function and the value of the function at the point may be
different.

Looking at a table of functional values or looking at the graph of a function provides us with useful insight into the value
of the limit of a function at a given point. However, these techniques rely too much on guesswork. We eventually need to
develop alternative methods of evaluating limits. These new methods are more algebraic in nature and we explore them in
the next section; however, at this point we introduce two special limits that are foundational to the techniques to come.

Theorem 2.1: Two Important Limits
Let a be a real number and c be a constant.

                                               i.      lim x    =  a                                                 (2.4)
                                                                                                                     (2.5)
                                                       xa

                                               ii.     lim c    =  c

                                                       xa

We can make the following observations about these two limits.

i.  For the first limit, observe that as x approaches a, so does f (x),  because   f (x) = x.  Consequently,  lim x  =  a.

                                                                                                              xa

ii. For the second limit, consider Table 2.4.

                    x                        f(x) = c              x               f(x) = c

                    a - 0.1    c                                   a + 0.1         c

                    a - 0.01   c                                   a + 0.01        c

                    a - 0.001  c                                   a + 0.001       c

                    a - 0.0001 c                                   a + 0.0001 c

                    Table 2.4 Table of Functional Values for          lim c  =  c

                                                                      xa
142                                                                                                         Chapter 2 | Limits

Observe that for all values of x (regardless of whether they are approaching a), the values f (x) remain constant at c. We

have no choice but to conclude  lim c  =  c.

                                xa

The Existence of a Limit

As we consider the limit in the next example, keep in mind that for the limit of a function to exist at a point, the functional
values must approach a single real-number value at that point. If the functional values do not approach a single value, then
the limit does not exist.

     Example 2.7

     Evaluating a Limit That Fails to Exist

     Table 2.5 lists values for the function sin(1/x) for the given values of x.

     After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the y-values do not seem to approach any one
     single value. It appears the limit does not exist. Before drawing this conclusion, let's take a more systematic
     approach. Take the following sequence of x-values approaching 0:

                                              2, 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 ,                  2 ,....
                                              
                                              3 5 7 9 11

     The corresponding y-values are

                                              1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1,....

     At this point we can indeed conclude that lim sin (1/x) does not exist. (Mathematicians frequently abbreviate

                                                                   x0

                                                                       x0

in Figure 2.17 and it gives a clearer picture of the behavior of sin(1/x) as x approaches 0. You can see that
sin(1/x) oscillates ever more wildly between -1 and 1 as x approaches 0.

One-Sided Limits

Sometimes indicating that the limit of a function fails to exist at a point does not provide us with enough information
about the behavior of the function at that particular point. To see this, we now revisit the function g(x) = |x - 2|/(x - 2)
introduced at the beginning of the section (see Figure 2.12(b)). As we pick values of x close to 2, g(x) does not approach
a single value, so the limit as x approaches 2 does not exist--that is, lim g(x) DNE. However, this statement alone does

                                                                                                     x2

not give us a complete picture of the behavior of the function around the x-value 2. To provide a more accurate description,
we introduce the idea of a one-sided limit. For all values to the left of 2 (or the negative side of 2), g(x) = -1. Thus, as x
approaches 2 from the left, g(x) approaches -1. Mathematically, we say that the limit as x approaches 2 from the left is -1.
Symbolically, we express this idea as

                                                              lim- g(x) = -1.

                                                                           x2

Similarly, as x approaches 2 from the right (or from the positive side), g(x) approaches 1. Symbolically, we express this
idea as

                                                               lim g(x) = 1.

                                                                            x  2+

We can now present an informal definition of one-sided limits.

  Definition
   We define two types of one-sided limits.

Limit from the left: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (c, a), and let L be a real
number. If the values of the function f (x) approach the real number L as the values of x (where x < a) approach the
number a, then we say that L is the limit of f (x) as x approaches a from the left. Symbolically, we express this idea as

                                             lim- f (x) = L.                                            (2.6)

real number. If the values of the function f (x) approach the real number L as the values of x (where x > a) approach
the number a, then we say that L is the limit of f (x) as x approaches a from the right. Symbolically, we express this
idea as

Based on this table, we can conclude that a. lim- f (x) = 3 and b. lim f (x) = 0. Therefore, the (two-sided)

these limits.

Let us now consider the relationship between the limit of a function at a point and the limits from the right and left at that
point. It seems clear that if the limit from the right and the limit from the left have a common value, then that common value
is the limit of the function at that point. Similarly, if the limit from the left and the limit from the right take on different
values, the limit of the function does not exist. These conclusions are summarized in Relating One-Sided and Two-
Sided Limits.

Theorem 2.2: Relating One-Sided and Two-Sided Limits

Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a, with the possible exception of a itself,
and let L be a real number. Then,

                    lim  f  (x)  =  L.  if  and  only  if  lim- f (x) = L and  lim    f (x) = L.

Infinite Limits

Evaluating the limit of a function at a point or evaluating the limit of a function from the right and left at a point helps us to
characterize the behavior of a function around a given value. As we shall see, we can also describe the behavior of functions
that do not have finite limits.

We now turn our attention to h(x) = 1/(x - 2)2, the third and final function introduced at the beginning of this section
(see Figure 2.12(c)). From its graph we see that as the values of x approach 2, the values of h(x) = 1/(x - 2)2 become
larger and larger and, in fact, become infinite. Mathematically, we say that the limit of h(x) as x approaches 2 is positive
infinity. Symbolically, we express this idea as

                                                             lim h(x) = +.

                                                                            x2

More generally, we define infinite limits as follows:

Definition

We define three types of infinite limits.

Infinite limits from the left: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (b, a).

        i. If the values of f (x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x < a) approach the number a, then
            we say that the limit as x approaches a from the left is positive infinity and we write

                                            lim- f (x) = +.                                                                     (2.8)

                                           xa

     ii. If the values of f (x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x < a) approach the number a, then

             we say that the limit as x approaches a from the left is negative infinity and we write

                                            lim- f (x) = -.                                                                     (2.9)

                                           xa

Infinite limits from the right: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (a, c).

        i. If the values of f (x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x > a) approach the number a, then
            we say that the limit as x approaches a from the right is positive infinity and we write

                                            lim f (x) = +.                                                                   (2.10)

                                           x  a+

     ii. If the values of f (x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x > a) approach the number a, then

             we say that the limit as x approaches a from the right is negative infinity and we write

                                            lim f (x) = -.                                                                   (2.11)

                                           x  a+

Two-sided infinite limit: Let f (x) be defined for all x  a in an open interval containing a.

        i. If the values of f (x) increase without bound as the values of x (where x  a) approach the number a, then
            we say that the limit as x approaches a is positive infinity and we write

                                           lim  f  (x)  =                         +.                                         (2.12)

                                           xa

     ii. If the values of f (x) decrease without bound as the values of x (where x  a) approach the number a, then

             we say that the limit as x approaches a is negative infinity and we write

                                           lim  f  (x)  =                         -.                                         (2.13)

                                           xa

It is important to understand that when we write statements such as                   lim  f  (x)  =  +  or  lim  f  (x)  =  -  we are

                                                                                      xa                     xa

describing the behavior of the function, as we have just defined it. We are not asserting that a limit exists. For the

limit of a function f (x) to exist at a, it must approach a real number L as x approaches a. That said, if, for example,

lim  f  (x)  =  +,  we always write xlima f (x) = + rather than xlima f (x) DNE.

  Recognizing an Infinite Limit

Evaluate each of the following limits, if possible. Use a table of functional values and graph f (x) = 1/x to
confirm your conclusion.

a. The values of 1/x decrease without bound as x approaches 0 from the left. We conclude that

                                                                  lim-  1   =  -.

b. The values of 1/x increase without bound as x approaches 0 from the right. We conclude that

c. Since                    lim-  1  =  -    and  lim    1  =  +  have different values, we conclude that

The graph of f (x) = 1/x in Figure 2.19 confirms these conclusions.

                      Figure 2.19 The graph of f (x) = 1/x confirms that the limit
                      as x approaches 0 does not exist.

     to confirm your conclusion.

     c. lim 1

It is useful to point out that functions of the form f (x) = 1/(x - a)n, where n is a positive integer, have infinite limits as x

approaches a from either the left or right (Figure 2.20). These limits are summarized in Infinite Limits from Positive
Integers.

Theorem 2.3: Infinite Limits from Positive Integers

If n is a positive even integer, then

                                       lim  1 n = +.
                                            (x - a)

If n is a positive odd integer, then

                                        lim 1 n = +
                                       x  a+ (x - a)

and

                                        lim- 1 n = -.
                                       x  a (x - a)

We should also point out that in the graphs of f (x) = 1/(x - a)n, points on the graph having x-coordinates very near to a
are very close to the vertical line x = a. That is, as x approaches a, the points on the graph of f (x) are closer to the line
x = a. The line x = a is called a vertical asymptote of the graph. We formally define a vertical asymptote as follows:

  Definition
  Let f (x) be a function. If any of the following conditions hold, then the line x = a is a vertical asymptote of f (x).

                                                        lim- f (x) = + or -

     Finding a Vertical Asymptote

     Evaluate each of the following limits using Infinite Limits from Positive Integers. Identify any vertical
     asymptotes of the function f (x) = 1/(x + 3)4.

     a.      lim -  1

                         4

          x  -3+ (x + 3)4

     c. lim 1
          x  -3(x + 3)4

     Solution
     We can use Infinite Limits from Positive Integers directly.

         a. lim - 1 4 = +
              x  -3 (x + 3)

         b. lim 1 = +
              x  -3+ (x + 3)4

         c. lim 1 = +
              x  -3(x + 3)4

     The function f (x) = 1/(x + 3)4 has a vertical asymptote of x = -3.

     2.9 Evaluate each of the following limits. Identify any vertical asymptotes of the function f (x) = 1 (x - 2)3.

         a.  lim-   1

                         3
             x  2 (x - 2)

         c. lim 1
              x  2(x - 2)3

In the next example we put our knowledge of various types of limits to use to analyze the behavior of a function at several
different points.

   Example 2.11

     Behavior of a Function at Different Points

     Use the graph of f (x) in Figure 2.21 to determine each of the following values:

                    Figure 2.21 The graph shows f (x).

Solution

Using Infinite Limits from Positive Integers and the graph for reference, we arrive at the following values:

   Example 2.12

     Chapter Opener: Einstein's Equation

                                Figure 2.22 (credit: NASA)

In the chapter opener we mentioned briefly how Albert Einstein showed that a limit exists to how fast any object
can travel. Given Einstein's equation for the mass of a moving object, what is the value of this bound?

Solution
Our starting point is Einstein's equation for the mass of a moving object,

                                                        m = m0 ,
                                                               1 - v2 c2

where m0 is the object's mass at rest, v is its speed, and c is the speed of light. To see how the mass changes at
high speeds, we can graph the ratio of masses m/m0 as a function of the ratio of speeds, v/c (Figure 2.23).

                                       Figure 2.23 This graph shows the ratio of masses as a
                                       function of the ratio of speeds in Einstein's equation for the
                                       mass of a moving object.
      We can see that as the ratio of speeds approaches 1--that is, as the speed of the object approaches the speed
      of light--the ratio of masses increases without bound. In other words, the function has a vertical asymptote at
      v/c = 1. We can try a few values of this ratio to test this idea.

                    Ratio of Masses and Speeds for a
                    Moving Object

Thus, according to Table 2.8, if an object with mass 100 kg is traveling at 0.9999c, its mass becomes 7071 kg.
Since no object can have an infinite mass, we conclude that no object can travel at or more than the speed of light.

2.3 | The Limit Laws

                      Learning Objectives

     2.3.1  Recognize the basic limit laws.
     2.3.2  Use the limit laws to evaluate the limit of a function.
     2.3.3  Evaluate the limit of a function by factoring.
     2.3.4  Use the limit laws to evaluate the limit of a polynomial or rational function.
     2.3.5  Evaluate the limit of a function by factoring or by using conjugates.
     2.3.6  Evaluate the limit of a function by using the squeeze theorem.

In the previous section, we evaluated limits by looking at graphs or by constructing a table of values. In this section, we
establish laws for calculating limits and learn how to apply these laws. In the Student Project at the end of this section, you
have the opportunity to apply these limit laws to derive the formula for the area of a circle by adapting a method devised by
the Greek mathematician Archimedes. We begin by restating two useful limit results from the previous section. These two
results, together with the limit laws, serve as a foundation for calculating many limits.

Evaluating Limits with the Limit Laws

The first two limit laws were stated in Two Important Limits and we repeat them here. These basic results, together with
the other limit laws, allow us to evaluate limits of many algebraic functions.

Theorem 2.4: Basic Limit Results
For any real number a and any constant c,

                                                                                            (2.15)
                                                xa

                                           ii.  lim c  =                          c

                                                xa

     Example 2.13

       Evaluating a Basic Limit

       Evaluate each of the following limits using Basic Limit Results.
           a. lim x

                    x2

           b. lim 5

                    x2

       Solution
           a. The limit of x as x approaches a is a: lim x = 2.

                                                                         x2

           b. The limit of a constant is that constant: lim 5 = 5.

                                                                            x2

We now take a look at the limit laws, the individual properties of limits. The proofs that these laws hold are omitted here.

We now practice applying these limit laws to evaluate a limit.

   Example 2.14

     Evaluating a Limit Using Limit Laws

Use the limit laws to evaluate lim (4x + 2).

                                            x  -3

Solution

Let's apply the limit laws one step at a time to be sure we understand how they work. We need to keep in mind
the requirement that, at each application of a limit law, the new limits must exist for the limit law to be applied.

 lim (4x + 2)        = lim 4x + lim 2                     Apply the sum law.
                       x  -3           x  -3              Apply the constant multiple law.
x  -3                                                     Apply the basic limit results and simplify.

                     = 4 · lim x + lim 2

                            x  -3 x  -3

                     = 4 · (-3) + 2 = -10.

Example 2.15

  Using Limit Laws Repeatedly
  Use the limit laws to evaluate lim 2x2 - 3x + 1.

                                     x  2 x3 + 4

     To find this limit, we need to apply the limit laws several times. Again, we need to keep in mind that as we rewrite
     the limit in terms of other limits, each new limit must exist for the limit law to be applied.

Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions

By now you have probably noticed that, in each of the previous examples, it has been the case that xlima f (x) = f (a). This
is not always true, but it does hold for all polynomials for any choice of a and for all rational functions at all values of a for
which the rational function is defined.

  Theorem 2.6: Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions
  Let p(x) and q(x) be polynomial functions. Let a be a real number. Then,

                                                            xlimap(x) = p(a)
                                                   xlima p(x) q(x) = p(a) q(a) when q(a)  0.

To see that this theorem holds, consider the polynomial p(x) = cn xn + cn - 1 xn - 1 +  + c1 x + c0. By applying the
sum, constant multiple, and power laws, we end up with

     xlima p(x)                =      lim       xn  +  cn  -  1  xn  -  1  +                           
                                      xa
                                           c n                                      + c1 x + c0

                                       n                          n - 1                                        
                               = cn xlimax + cn - 1 xlimax                          +    +  c  1         xlimax  +  lim c  0

                                                                                                                    xa

                               = cnan + cn - 1an - 1 +  + c1a + c0

                               = p(a).

It now follows from the quotient law that if p(x) and q(x) are polynomials for which q(a)  0, then

                                                       xlima q(x) p(x) = q(a) p(a).

Example 2.16 applies this result.

Example 2.16

  Evaluating a Limit of a Rational Function

Evaluate the lim 2x2 - 3x + 1.
               x  3 5x + 4

Solution

Since 3 is in the domain of the rational function f (x) = 2x2 - 3x + 1,        we can calculate the limit by substituting
                                                                    5x + 4

3 for x into the function. Thus,

                                                 lim 2x2 - 3x + 1 = 10.

                              x  -2

Additional Limit Evaluation Techniques

As we have seen, we may evaluate easily the limits of polynomials and limits of some (but not all) rational functions by
direct substitution. However, as we saw in the introductory section on limits, it is certainly possible for xlima f (x) to exist
when f (a) is undefined. The following observation allows us to evaluate many limits of this type:

If for all  x  a,   f (x) = g(x)   over some open interval containing a, then  lim  f  (x)  =  xlimag(x).

                                                                               xa

To understand this idea better, consider the limit lim x2 - 1.
                                                        x1 x-1

The function

                                                         f (x) = x2 - 1
                                                                    x-1

                                                                = (x - 1)(x + 1)
                                                                         x-1

and the function g(x) = x + 1 are identical for all values of x  1. The graphs of these two functions are shown in Figure
2.24.
164  Chapter 2 | Limits

Figure 2.24 The graphs of f (x) and g(x) are identical for all x  1. Their limits at 1 are equal.

We see that
                                                  lim x2 - 1 = lim (x - 1)(x + 1)
                                                 x1 x-1 x1 x-1
                                                                  = lim (x + 1)

                                                                                      x1

                                                                  = 2.
The limit has the form xlima f (x) g(x) , where xlima f (x) = 0 and xlimag(x) = 0. (In this case, we say that f (x)/g(x) has the
indeterminate form 0/0.) The following Problem-Solving Strategy provides a general outline for evaluating limits of this
type.

  Problem-Solving Strategy: Calculating a Limit When f(x)/g(x) has the Indeterminate Form 0/0
       1. First, we need to make sure that our function has the appropriate form and cannot be evaluated immediately
            using the limit laws.
       2. We then need to find a function that is equal to h(x) = f (x)/g(x) for all x  a over some interval containing
            a. To do this, we may need to try one or more of the following steps:
                a. If f (x) and g(x) are polynomials, we should factor each function and cancel out any common factors.
                 b. If the numerator or denominator contains a difference involving a square root, we should try
                      multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the expression involving the square
                      root.
                c. If f (x)/g(x) is a complex fraction, we begin by simplifying it.
       3. Last, we apply the limit laws.

The next examples demonstrate the use of this Problem-Solving Strategy. Example 2.17 illustrates the factor-and-cancel
technique; Example 2.18 shows multiplying by a conjugate. In Example 2.19, we look at simplifying a complex fraction.

Example 2.17

  Evaluating a Limit by Factoring and Canceling

Evaluate lim x2 - 3x .
           x  32x2 - 5x - 3

Solution

Step 1. The function f (x) = 2x2x2 - 3x - 5x - 3 is undefined for x = 3. In fact, if we substitute 3 into the function
we get 0/0, which is undefined. Factoring and canceling is a good strategy:

                                    lim x2 - 3x = lim                     x(x - 3)

                                              2
                                    x  32x - 5x - 3 x  3(x - 3)(2x + 1)

Step 2. For all x  3, x2 - 3x = x . Therefore,
                          2x2 - 5x - 3 2x + 1

                                        lim x(x - 3) = lim x .
                                        x  3(x - 3)(2x + 1) x  32x + 1

Step 3. Evaluate using the limit laws:

                                              lim x = 3.
                                              x  32x + 1 7

Example 2.18

  Evaluating a Limit by Multiplying by a Conjugate

Evaluate lim x + 2 - 1.
           x  -1 x + 1

Solution                                                                                   x + 2 + 1, the conjugate of

Step 1. x + 2 - 1 has the form 0/0 at -1. Let's begin by multiplying by
              x+1

  x + 2 - 1, on the numerator and denominator:

                             lim x + 2 - 1 = lim x + 2 - 1 · x + 2 + 1.
                             x  -1 x + 1            x  -1 x + 1                     x+2+1

Step 2. We then multiply out the numerator. We don't multiply out the denominator because we are hoping that
the (x + 1) in the denominator cancels out in the end:

                                           = lim           x+1                   .
                                                               
                                           x    -1  (x  +        x  +  2  +  1
                                                           1)
166                                                                                     Chapter 2 | Limits

     Step 3. Then we cancel:                          = lim                       1.
     Step 4. Last, we apply the limit laws:           x  -1 x + 2 + 1

                                                      lim    1 = 1.
                                               x  -1 x + 2 + 1 2

     2.14 Evaluate lim x - 1 - 2.

       Evaluating a Limit by Simplifying a Complex Fraction

                        1 -1
     Evaluate lim x + 1 2 .

                x1 x-1

     Solution

                   1 -1
     Step 1. x + 1 2 has the form 0/0 at 1. We simplify the algebraic fraction by multiplying by

                   x-1
     2(x + 1)/2(x + 1) :

                                               1 -1                               1 -1
                              lim x + 1 2 = lim x + 1 2 · 2(x + 1).
                              x  1 x - 1 x  1 x - 1 2(x + 1)

     Step 2. Next, we multiply through the numerators. Do not multiply the denominators because we want to be able
     to cancel the factor (x - 1):

                                               = lim 2 - (x + 1) .
                                                 x  12(x - 1)(x + 1)

     Step 3. Then, we simplify the numerator:

                                               = lim -x + 1 .
                                                 x  12(x - 1)(x + 1)

     Step 4. Now we factor out -1 from the numerator:

                                               = lim -(x - 1) .
                                                 x  12(x - 1)(x + 1)

     Step 5. Then, we cancel the common factors of (x - 1):

                                                      = lim -1 .
                                                        x  12(x + 1)

     Step 6. Last, we evaluate using the limit laws:

                                               lim -1 = - 1.                      4

Example 2.20 does not fall neatly into any of the patterns established in the previous examples. However, with a little
creativity, we can still use these same techniques.

   Example 2.20

     Evaluating a Limit When the Limit Laws Do Not Apply

Evaluate            lim  1   +    5  
                    x  0 x(x - 5)x    .

Solution

Both 1/x and 5/x(x - 5) fail to have a limit at zero. Since neither of the two functions has a limit at zero, we
cannot apply the sum law for limits; we must use a different strategy. In this case, we find the limit by performing
addition and then applying one of our previous strategies. Observe that

                                             1+ 5        = x-5+5
                                             x x(x - 5)     x(x - 5)

                                                         = x.
                                                            x(x - 5)

Thus,

                                           lim 1 + 5  = lim x
                                           x  0x x(x - 5) x  0x(x - 5)

                                                         = lim 1
                                                           x  0x - 5

                                                         = - 1.
                                                               5

Let's now revisit one-sided limits. Simple modifications in the limit laws allow us to apply them to one-sided limits. For
example, to apply the limit laws to a limit of the form lim- h(x), we require the function h(x) to be defined over an

                                                                                 xa

open interval of the form (b, a); for a limit of the form lim h(x), we require the function h(x) to be defined over an

                                                                                  x  a+

open interval of the form (a, c). Example 2.21 illustrates this point.

     Solution
     Figure 2.25 illustrates the function f (x) = x - 3 and aids in our understanding of these limits.

     a. The function f (x) = x - 3 is defined over the interval [3, +). Since this function is not defined to
         the left of 3, we cannot apply the limit laws to compute lim- x - 3. In fact, since f (x) = x - 3 is

                                                                                             x3

         undefined to the left of 3, lim- x - 3 does not exist.

                                                 x3

     b. Since f (x) = x - 3 is defined to the right of 3, the limit laws do apply to lim x - 3. By applying

                                                                                                                         x  3+

         these limit laws we obtain lim x - 3 = 0.

                                                  x  3+

In Example 2.22 we look at one-sided limits of a piecewise-defined function and use these limits to draw a conclusion
about a two-sided limit of the same function.

                        Figure 2.26 This graph shows a function f (x).

a. Since f (x) = 4x - 3 for all x in (-, 2), replace f (x) in the limit with 4x - 3 and apply the limit

We now turn our attention to evaluating a limit of the form xlima f (x) g(x) ,  where  lim  f  (x)  =  K,  where K  0 and

Example 2.23

Evaluating a Limit of the Form K/0, K  0 Using the Limit Laws

Evaluate lim- x - 3 .
           x  2 x2 - 2x

Solution
Step 1. After substituting in x = 2, we see that this limit has the form -1/0. That is, as x approaches 2 from the
170                                                                                  Chapter 2 | Limits

     left, the numerator approaches -1; and the denominator approaches 0. Consequently, the magnitude of x - 3
                                                                                                                            x(x - 2)

     becomes infinite. To get a better idea of what the limit is, we need to factor the denominator:

                                                   lim x - 3 = lim x - 3 .
                                                 x  2- x2 - 2x x  2- x(x - 2)

     Step 2. Since x - 2 is the only part of the denominator that is zero when 2 is substituted, we then separate
     1/(x - 2) from the rest of the function:

                                            =  lim-  x  -  3  ·  1    .

                                               x2

     Step 3.  lim x - 3  =  -1   and  lim-  1  = -. Therefore, the product of (x - 3)/x and 1/(x - 2) has
                 -x           2       x2 x-2

The Squeeze Theorem

The techniques we have developed thus far work very well for algebraic functions, but we are still unable to evaluate limits
of very basic trigonometric functions. The next theorem, called the squeeze theorem, proves very useful for establishing
basic trigonometric limits. This theorem allows us to calculate limits by "squeezing" a function, with a limit at a point a that
is unknown, between two functions having a common known limit at a. Figure 2.27 illustrates this idea.

                                       Figure 2.27 The Squeeze Theorem applies when
                                    f (x)  g(x)  h(x) and xlima f (x) = xlimah(x).

Theorem 2.7: The Squeeze Theorem
Let f (x), g(x), and h(x) be defined for all x  a over an open interval containing a. If

                                                         f (x)  g(x)  h(x)
for all x  a in an open interval containing a and

                       xa

where L is a real number, then xlimag(x) = L.

  Applying the Squeeze Theorem

Apply the squeeze theorem to evaluate lim x cos x.

                                                         x0

Solution

Because -1  cos x  1 for all x, we have - |x|  x cos x  |x| . Since lim ( - |x|) = 0 = lim |x|, from the
                                                                                 x0       x0

squeeze theorem, we obtain lim x cos x = 0. The graphs of f (x) = - |x|, g(x) = x cos x, and h(x) = |x| are

                                          x0

shown in Figure 2.28.

                                   Figure 2.28 The graphs of f (x), g(x), and h(x) are shown
                                   around the point x = 0.

        2.19 Use the squeeze theorem to evaluate lim x2 sin1x.

                                                                            x0

We now use the squeeze theorem to tackle several very important limits. Although this discussion is somewhat lengthy,
these limits prove invaluable for the development of the material in both the next section and the next chapter. The first of
these limits is lim sin . Consider the unit circle shown in Figure 2.29. In the figure, we see that sin  is the y-coordinate

                     0

on the unit circle and it corresponds to the line segment shown in blue. The radian measure of angle  is the length of the
arc it subtends on the unit circle. Therefore, we see that for 0 <  <  , 0 < sin  < .

                                                                               2
172                                                                                  Chapter 2 | Limits

           Figure 2.29 The sine function is shown as a line on the unit
           circle.

Because lim 0 = 0 and lim  = 0, by using the squeeze theorem we conclude that
       0+    0+

                      lim sin = 0.

                      0+

To see that lim- sin  = 0 as well, observe that for -  <  < 0, 0 < - <  and hence, 0 < sin (-) < -.22
     0

Consequently, 0 < - sin  < -. It follows that 0 > sin  > . An application of the squeeze theorem produces the

desired limit. Thus, since lim sin  = 0 and lim- sin  = 0,
             0+     0

                    lim sin = 0.                                                     (2.16)

                    0

Next, using the identity cos  = 1 - sin2  for -  <  <  , we see that22

                 lim cos = lim 1 - sin2  = 1.                                        (2.17)

                 0     0

We now take a look at a limit that plays an important role in later chapters--namely, lim sin . To evaluate this limit,
                                                                                                      0 

we use the unit circle in Figure 2.30. Notice that this figure adds one additional triangle to Figure 2.30. We see that the
length of the side opposite angle  in this new triangle is tan. Thus, we see that for 0 <  <  , sin  <  < tan.

                                                                                                              2

                             Figure 2.30 The sine and tangent functions are shown as lines
                             on the unit circle.

By dividing by sin  in all parts of the inequality, we obtain

                             1<  < 1 .
                                  sin cos

Equivalently, we have

                             1 > sin > cos.
                                    

Since lim 1 = 1 = lim cos , we conclude that lim sin  = 1. By applying a manipulation similar to that used
  0+                     0+    0+ 

in demonstrating that lim- sin  = 0, we can show that lim- sin  = 1. Thus,
                       0     0 

                             lim sin = 1.                                                                          (2.18)
                             0 

In Example 2.25 we use this limit to establish lim 1 - cos  = 0. This limit also proves useful in later chapters.

Deriving the Formula for the Area of a Circle

Some of the geometric formulas we take for granted today were first derived by methods that anticipate some of the
methods of calculus. The Greek mathematician Archimedes (ca. 287-212; BCE) was particularly inventive, using
polygons inscribed within circles to approximate the area of the circle as the number of sides of the polygon increased.
He never came up with the idea of a limit, but we can use this idea to see what his geometric constructions could have
predicted about the limit.

We can estimate the area of a circle by computing the area of an inscribed regular polygon. Think of the regular
polygon as being made up of n triangles. By taking the limit as the vertex angle of these triangles goes to zero, you can
obtain the area of the circle. To see this, carry out the following steps:

    1. Express the height h and the base b of the isosceles triangle in Figure 2.31 in terms of  and r.

                                         Figure 2.31

    2. Using the expressions that you obtained in step 1, express the area of the isosceles triangle in terms of  and r.
         (Substitute (1 / 2) sin  for sin( / 2) cos( / 2) in your expression.)

    3. If an n-sided regular polygon is inscribed in a circle of radius r, find a relationship between  and n. Solve this
         for n. Keep in mind there are 2 radians in a circle. (Use radians, not degrees.)

    4. Find an expression for the area of the n-sided polygon in terms of r and .
    5. To find a formula for the area of the circle, find the limit of the expression in step 4 as  goes to zero. (Hint:

          lim (sin) = 1).
         0 
The technique of estimating areas of regions by using polygons is revisited in Introduction to Integration.

2.4 | Continuity

                    Learning Objectives

2.4.3               Define continuity on an interval.

2.4.5               Provide an example of the intermediate value theorem.

Many functions have the property that their graphs can be traced with a pencil without lifting the pencil from the page. Such
functions are called continuous. Other functions have points at which a break in the graph occurs, but satisfy this property
over intervals contained in their domains. They are continuous on these intervals and are said to have a discontinuity at a
point where a break occurs.

We begin our investigation of continuity by exploring what it means for a function to have continuity at a point. Intuitively,
a function is continuous at a particular point if there is no break in its graph at that point.

Continuity at a Point

Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let's consider various
functions that fail to meet our intuitive notion of what it means to be continuous at a point. We then create a list of conditions
that prevent such failures.

Our first function of interest is shown in Figure 2.32. We see that the graph of f (x) has a hole at a. In fact, f (a) is
undefined. At the very least, for f (x) to be continuous at a, we need the following condition:

                                                            i. f (a) is defined.

                    Figure 2.32 The function f (x) is not continuous at a
                    because f (a) is undefined.

However, as we see in Figure 2.33, this condition alone is insufficient to guarantee continuity at the point a. Although
 f (a) is defined, the function has a gap at a. In this example, the gap exists because xlima f (x) does not exist. We must add
another condition for continuity at a--namely,

     Figure 2.33 The function f (x) is not continuous at a
     because lim f (x) does not exist.

                 xa

However, as we see in Figure 2.34, these two conditions by themselves do not guarantee continuity at a point. The function
in this figure satisfies both of our first two conditions, but is still not continuous at a. We must add a third condition to our
list:

     iii.  lim  f  (x)  =  f (a).

                                   because xlima f (x)  f (a).

Now we put our list of conditions together and form a definition of continuity at a point.
  Definition
  A function f (x) is continuous at a point a if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:
        i. f (a) is defined
       ii. xlima f (x) exists
      iii. xlima f (x) = f (a)
   A function is discontinuous at a point a if it fails to be continuous at a.

The following procedure can be used to analyze the continuity of a function at a point using this definition.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Determining Continuity at a Point

1. Check to see if f (a) is defined. If f (a) is undefined, we need go no further. The function is not continuous
    at a. If f (a) is defined, continue to step 2.

2. Compute xlima f (x). In some cases, we may need to do this by first computing lim- f (x) and lim f (x).
                                                                    xa            x  a+

If xlima f (x) does not exist (that is, it is not a real number), then the function is not continuous at a and the

problem is solved. If xlima f (x) exists, then continue to step 3.

3. Compare f (a) and xlima f (x). If xlima f (x)  f (a),         then the function is not continuous at a. If
     xlima f (x) = f (a), then the function is continuous at a.

The next three examples demonstrate how to apply this definition to determine whether a function is continuous at a given
point. These examples illustrate situations in which each of the conditions for continuity in the definition succeed or fail.

   Example 2.26

     Determining Continuity at a Point, Condition 1

     Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) = (x2 - 4)/(x - 2) is continuous at x = 2. Justify
      the conclusion.

     Solution
     Let's begin by trying to calculate f (2). We can see that f (2) = 0/0, which is undefined. Therefore,
       f (x) = x2 - 4 is discontinuous at 2 because f (2) is undefined. The graph of f (x) is shown in Figure 2.35.

     Example 2.27

       Determining Continuity at a Point, Condition 2

     Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) = -x2 + 4 if x  3 is continuous at x = 3. Justify
                                                                           4x - 8 if x > 3

     the conclusion.

     Solution
     Let's begin by trying to calculate f (3).

                                                f (3) = - (32) + 4 = -5.

     Thus, f (3) is defined. Next, we calculate lim f (x). To do this, we must compute lim- f (x) and
                                                x3                                        x3

      lim f (x):

     x  3+

                                                     lim- f (x) = - (32) + 4 = -5

                                                              x3

     and

                                                       lim f (x) = 4(3) - 8 = 4.

                                                                 x  3+

     Therefore, lim f (x) does not exist. Thus, f (x) is not continuous at 3. The graph of f (x) is shown in Figure

                     x3

     2.36.

Example 2.28

  Determining Continuity at a Point, Condition 3

Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) =  x
                                                             1 if x = 0

Solution
First, observe that

                                                f (0) = 1.

Next,

                     lim  f (x) =               lim  sin x       =  1.
                     x0                         x0    x

Last, compare f (0) and lim f (x). We see that

                                     x1

                     f (0) = 1 = lim f (x).

                                      x0

Since all three of the conditions in the definition of continuity are satisfied, f (x) is continuous at x = 0.

2.21                                                                    2x + 1 if x < 1

                    Using the definition, determine whether the function f (x) =  2 if x = 1 is continuous at x = 1.
                                                                        -x + 4 if x > 1

If the function is not continuous at 1, indicate the condition for continuity at a point that fails to hold.

By applying the definition of continuity and previously established theorems concerning the evaluation of limits, we can
state the following theorem.

  Theorem 2.8: Continuity of Polynomials and Rational Functions
   Polynomials and rational functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

Proof
Previously, we showed that if p(x) and q(x) are polynomials, xlimap(x) = p(a) for every polynomial p(x) and
xlima p(x) q(x) = p(a) q(a) as long as q(a)  0. Therefore, polynomials and rational functions are continuous on their domains.

We now apply Continuity of Polynomials and Rational Functions to determine the points at which a given rational
function is continuous.

     Solution
     The rational function f (x) = x + 1 is continuous for every value of x except x = 5.

Types of Discontinuities

As we have seen in Example 2.26 and Example 2.27, discontinuities take on several different appearances. We
classify the types of discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump
discontinuities. Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump
discontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite
discontinuity is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. Figure 2.37 illustrates the differences in these types of
discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities, keep in
mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories.

Figure 2.37 Discontinuities are classified as (a) removable, (b) jump, or (c) infinite.

These three discontinuities are formally defined as follows:

Definition

If f (x) is discontinuous at a, then

     1. f has a removable discontinuity at a if xlima f (x) exists. (Note: When we state that xlima f (x) exists, we
         mean that xlima f (x) = L, where L is a real number.)

     2. f has a jump discontinuity at a if lim- f (x) and lim f (x) both exist, but lim- f (x)  lim f (x).
                                          xa                                      x  a+         xa  x  a+

     (Note: When we state that lim- f (x) and lim f (x) both exist, we mean that both are real-valued and that
                                      xa      x  a+

     neither take on the values ±.)

     3. f has an infinite discontinuity at a if lim- f (x) = ± or lim f (x) = ±.
                                          xa                                             x  a+

Example 2.30

  Classifying a Discontinuity

In Example 2.26, we showed that f (x) = x2 - 4 is discontinuous at x = 2. Classify this discontinuity as
                                                      x-2

removable, jump, or infinite.

Solution
To classify the discontinuity at 2 we must evaluate lim f (x):

                                                                          x2

                               lim f (x)  = lim x2 - 4
                                            x2 x-2
                               x2
                                          = lim (x - 2)(x + 2)
                                            x2 x-2

                                          = lim (x + 2)

                                             x2

                                          = 4.

Since f is discontinuous at 2 and lim f (x) exists, f has a removable discontinuity at x = 2.

                                                x2

Example 2.31

  Classifying a Discontinuity

In Example 2.27, we showed that f (x) = -x2 + 4 if x  3                       is discontinuous at  x = 3.  Classify this
                                                        4x - 8 if x > 3

discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite.

Solution

Earlier, we showed that f is discontinuous at 3 because lim f (x) does not exist. However, since

                                                                                               x3

lim- f (x) = -5 and lim f (x) = 4 both exist, we conclude that the function has a jump discontinuity at 3.
x3                  x  3+

Example 2.32

  Classifying a Discontinuity

  Determine whether f (x) = x + 2 is continuous at -1. If the function is discontinuous at -1, classify the
                                    x+1

  discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite.

  Solution
  The function value f (-1) is undefined. Therefore, the function is not continuous at -1. To determine the type of
186                                                                                                Chapter 2 | Limits

       discontinuity, we must determine the limit at -1. We see that lim - x + 2 = - and lim x + 2 = +.
                                                                                  x  -1 x + 1      x  -1+ x + 1

       Therefore, the function has an infinite discontinuity at -1.

       2.23       For f (x) =   x2 if x  1 , decide whether f is continuous at 1. If f is not continuous at 1, classify the

                                 3 if x = 1

       discontinuity as removable, jump, or infinite.

Continuity over an Interval

Now that we have explored the concept of continuity at a point, we extend that idea to continuity over an interval. As
we develop this idea for different types of intervals, it may be useful to keep in mind the intuitive idea that a function is
continuous over an interval if we can use a pencil to trace the function between any two points in the interval without lifting
the pencil from the paper. In preparation for defining continuity on an interval, we begin by looking at the definition of what
it means for a function to be continuous from the right at a point and continuous from the left at a point.

  Continuity from the Right and from the Left

  A function f (x) is said to be continuous from the right at a if lim f (x) = f (a).

                                                                                                 x  a+

  A function f (x) is said to be continuous from the left at a if lim- f (x) = f (a).

                                                                                              xa

A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. A function f (x) is continuous

over a closed interval of the form              if it is continuous at every point in   (a,    b)  and is continuous from the right at a

                                    a,     b

and is continuous from the left at b. Analogously, a function  f (x)              is continuous over an interval of the form  (a,       if it is

                                                                                                                                   b

continuous over (a, b) and is continuous from the left at b. Continuity over other types of intervals are defined in a similar

fashion.

Requiring that lim f (x) = f (a) and lim- f (x) = f (b) ensures that we can trace the graph of the function from the
                  x  a+                         xb

point      f (a)  to the point      f (b)  without lifting the pencil. If, for example,        lim f (x)  f (a), we would need to lift
                                                                                         x  a+
       a,                       b,

our pencil to jump from  f (a)      to the graph of the rest of the function over  (a,     

                                                                                        b.

     Example 2.33

       Continuity on an Interval

       State the interval(s) over which the function f (x) = xx2 - 1 + 2x is continuous.

       Solution
       Since f (x) = xx2 - 1 + 2x is a rational function, it is continuous at every point in its domain. The domain of
        f (x) is the set (-, -2)  (-2, 0)  (0, +). Thus, f (x) is continuous over each of the intervals

(-, -2), (-2, 0), and (0, +).

Example 2.34

  Continuity over an Interval

State the interval(s) over which the function f (x) = 4 - x2 is continuous.

Solution

From the limit laws, we know that    lim  4 - x2 = 4 - a2 for all values of a in (-2, 2). We also know that
                                          4 - x2 = 0 exists. Therefore, f (x) is continuous over the interval
                                     xa

lim 4 - x2 = 0 exists and lim-
x  -2+                               x2

[-2, 2].

2.24 State the interval(s) over which the function f (x) = x + 3 is continuous.

The Composite Function Theorem allows us to expand our ability to compute limits. In particular, this theorem
ultimately allows us to demonstrate that trigonometric functions are continuous over their domains.

Theorem 2.9: Composite Function Theorem

If f (x) is continuous at L and xlimag(x) = L, then

                                     lim  f  g(x)    =                  f (L).

                                                        f  lim  g(x) =

Before we move on to Example 2.35, recall that earlier, in the section on limit laws, we showed lim cos x = 1 = cos (0).

                                                                                                                                           x0

Consequently, we know that f (x) = cos x is continuous at 0. In Example 2.35 we see how to combine this result with the
composite function theorem.

     we may apply the composite function theorem. Thus,

                                                                                 lim     -      =  cos  (0)  =  1.

The proof of the next theorem uses the composite function theorem as well as the continuity of f (x) = sin x and
g(x) = cos x at the point 0 to show that trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains.

  Theorem 2.10: Continuity of Trigonometric Functions
   Trigonometric functions are continuous over their entire domains.

Proof

We begin by demonstrating that cos x is continuous at every real number. To do this, we must show that xlimacos x = cos a
for all values of a.

xlimacos x  = xlimacos ((x - a) + a)                                                  rewrite x = x - a + a
                                                                                      apply the identity for the cosine of the sum of two angles
            =  lim       (  x  -  a) cos a  -  sin (x  -  a)  sin     
               xa                                                                     xlima(x - a) = 0, and sin x and cos x are continuous at 0
                    cos                                            a                  evaluate cos(0) and sin(0) and simplify

            = cos xlima(x - a)cos a - sin xlima(x - a)sin a             

            = cos(0)cosa - sin(0)sina

            = 1 · cosa - 0 · sina = cosa.

The proof that sin x is continuous at every real number is analogous. Because the remaining trigonometric functions may
be expressed in terms of sin x and cos x, their continuity follows from the quotient limit law.



As you can see, the composite function theorem is invaluable in demonstrating the continuity of trigonometric functions.
As we continue our study of calculus, we revisit this theorem many times.

The Intermediate Value Theorem

Functions that are continuous over intervals of the form                      a, b,   where a and b are real numbers, exhibit many useful

properties. Throughout our study of calculus, we will encounter many powerful theorems concerning such functions. The

first of these theorems is the Intermediate Value Theorem.

  Theorem 2.11: The Intermediate Value Theorem

  Let f be continuous over a closed, bounded interval                            If z is any real number between     f (a) and  f (b),  then there

                                                                        a,  b.

  is a number c in  a, b       satisfying   f (c) = z     in Figure 2.38.

                           Figure 2.38    There is a number       c                that satisfies

                                                                         a,   b

                           f (c) = z.

Example 2.36

  Application of the Intermediate Value Theorem

Show that f (x) = x - cos x has at least one zero.

Solution

Since f (x) = x - cos x is continuous over (-, +), it is continuous over any closed interval of the form

a, b.   If you can find an interval     a, b  such that           f (a)  and       f (b)  have opposite signs, you can use the

Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude there must be a real number c in (a, b) that satisfies f (c) = 0. Note

that

                                          f (0) = 0 - cos(0) = -1 < 0

and

                                          f   =  - cos =  > 0.

                                           
                                              22                  22

Using the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can see that there must be a real number c in [0, /2] that satisfies
 f (c) = 0. Therefore, f (x) = x - cos x has at least one zero.

Example 2.37

  When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?

If f (x) is continuous over [0, 2], f (0) > 0 and f (2) > 0, can we use the Intermediate Value Theorem to

conclude that       f (x)  has no zeros in the interval      2]?  Explain.

       Solution
       No. The Intermediate Value Theorem only allows us to conclude that we can find a value between f (0) and
        f (2); it doesn't allow us to conclude that we can't find other values. To see this more clearly, consider the
       function f (x) = (x - 1)2. It satisfies f (0) = 1 > 0, f (2) = 1 > 0, and f (1) = 0.

     Example 2.38

       When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?
       For f (x) = 1/x, f (-1) = -1 < 0 and f (1) = 1 > 0. Can we conclude that f (x) has a zero in the interval
       [-1, 1] ?
       Solution
       No. The function is not continuous over [-1, 1]. The Intermediate Value Theorem does not apply here.

2.5 | The Precise Definition of a Limit

                     Learning Objectives

     2.5.1  Describe the epsilon-delta definition of a limit.
     2.5.2  Apply the epsilon-delta definition to find the limit of a function.
     2.5.3  Describe the epsilon-delta definitions of one-sided limits and infinite limits.
     2.5.4  Use the epsilon-delta definition to prove the limit laws.

By now you have progressed from the very informal definition of a limit in the introduction of this chapter to the intuitive
understanding of a limit. At this point, you should have a very strong intuitive sense of what the limit of a function means
and how you can find it. In this section, we convert this intuitive idea of a limit into a formal definition using precise
mathematical language. The formal definition of a limit is quite possibly one of the most challenging definitions you will
encounter early in your study of calculus; however, it is well worth any effort you make to reconcile it with your intuitive
notion of a limit. Understanding this definition is the key that opens the door to a better understanding of calculus.

Quantifying Closeness

Before stating the formal definition of a limit, we must introduce a few preliminary ideas. Recall that the distance between

two points a and b on a number line is given by |a - b|.

    · The statement | f (x) - L| <  may be interpreted as: The distance between f (x) and L is less than .

     · The statement 0 < |x - a| <  may be interpreted as: x  a and the distance between x and a is less than .

It is also important to look at the following equivalences for absolute value:

    · The statement | f (x) - L| <  is equivalent to the statement L -  < f (x) < L + .

     · The statement 0 < |x - a| <  is equivalent to the statement a -  < x < a +  and x  a.

With these clarifications, we can state the formal epsilon-delta definition of the limit.

Definition
Let f (x) be defined for all x  a over an open interval containing a. Let L be a real number. Then

                                           lim  f  (x)                            =  L

                                           xa

if, for every  > 0,  there exists a  > 0,  such that if 0 < |x - a| < ,                 then | f (x) - L| < .

This definition may seem rather complex from a mathematical point of view, but it becomes easier to understand if we
break it down phrase by phrase. The statement itself involves something called a universal quantifier (for every  > 0), an

existential quantifier (there exists a  > 0), and, last, a conditional statement (if 0 < |x - a| < , then | f (x) - L| < ).

Let's take a look at Table 2.9, which breaks down the definition and translates each part.

Table 2.9 Translation of the Epsilon-Delta Definition of the Limit

We can get a better handle on this definition by looking at the definition geometrically. Figure 2.39 shows possible values
of  for various choices of  > 0 for a given function f (x), a number a, and a limit L at a. Notice that as we choose

smaller values of  (the distance between the function and the limit), we can always find a  small enough so that if we
have chosen an x value within  of a, then the value of f (x) is within  of the limit L.

specified value.

     Let  > 0.

     The first part of the definition begins "For every  > 0." This means we must prove that whatever follows is true
     no matter what positive value of  is chosen. By stating "Let  > 0," we signal our intent to do so.

     Choose  = .
                    2

     The definition continues with "there exists a  > 0. " The phrase "there exists" in a mathematical statement is
     always a signal for a scavenger hunt. In other words, we must go and find . So, where exactly did  = /2
     come from? There are two basic approaches to tracking down . One method is purely algebraic and the other is
     geometric.

     We begin by tackling the problem from an algebraic point of view. Since ultimately we want |(2x + 1) - 3| < ,
     we begin by manipulating this expression: |(2x + 1) - 3| <  is equivalent to |2x - 2| < , which in turn

     is equivalent to |2||x - 1| < . Last, this is equivalent to |x - 1| < /2. Thus, it would seem that  = /2 is
     appropriate.

     We may also find  through geometric methods. Figure 2.40 demonstrates how this is done.

            Figure 2.40 This graph shows how we find  geometrically.

     Assume 0 < |x - 1| < . When  has been chosen, our goal is to show that if 0 < |x - 1| < , then

     |(2x + 1) - 3| < . To prove any statement of the form "If this, then that," we begin by assuming "this" and

     trying to get "that."

     Thus,

     |(2x + 1) - 3|  = |2x - 2|    property of absolute value

                     = |2(x - 1)|  |2| = 2

                     = |2||x - 1|  here's where we use the assumption that 0 < |x - 1| < 
                     = 2|x - 1|    here's where we use our choice of  = /2
                     < 2·

In this part of the proof, we started with |(2x + 1) - 3| and used our assumption 0 < |x - 1| <  in a key part
of the chain of inequalities to get |(2x + 1) - 3| to be less than . We could just as easily have manipulated the
assumed inequality 0 < |x - 1| <  to arrive at |(2x + 1) - 3| <  as follows:

0 < |x - 1| <        |x - 1| < 

                     -<x-1<
                     - <x-1<

                     -  < 2x - 2 < 

                     |2x - 2| < 

                     |(2x + 1) - 3| < .

Therefore, lim (2x + 1) = 3. (Having completed the proof, we state what we have accomplished.)

                x1

After removing all the remarks, here is a final version of the proof:

Let  > 0.
Choose  = /2.
Assume 0 < |x - 1| < .
Thus,

|(2x + 1) - 3|      = |2x - 2|

                    = |2(x - 1)|

                    = |2||x - 1|
                    = 2|x - 1|
                    < 2·
                    = 2·

                          2
                    = .

Therefore, lim (2x + 1) = 3.

3. The next statement in the proof should be (at this point, we fill in our given value for a):
    Assume 0 < |x - a| < .

4. Next, based on this assumption, we need to show that | f (x) - L| < , where f (x) and L are our function

     f (x) and our limit L. At some point, we need to use 0 < |x - a| < .

5.  We conclude our proof with the statement: Therefore,  lim  f  (x)  =  L.

                                           x  -1

       Let _____.
       Choose  = _______.

      Assume 0 < |x - _______| < .

       Thus, |________ - ________| = _____________________________________.

       Solution
       We begin by filling in the blanks where the choices are specified by the definition. Thus, we have
       Let  > 0.
       Choose  = _______.

      Assume 0 < |x - (-1)| < . (or equivalently, 0 < |x + 1| < .)
      Thus, |(4x + 1) - (-3)| = |4x + 4| = |4||x + 1| < 4_______.

       Focusing on the final line of the proof, we see that we should choose  = .
                                                                                             4

       We now complete the final write-up of the proof:
       Let  > 0.
       Choose  = .

                      4

      Assume 0 < |x - (-1)| <  (or equivalently, 0 < |x + 1| < .)
      Thus, |(4x + 1) - (-3)| = |4x + 4| = |4||x + 1| < 4 = 4(/4) = .

        2.27 Complete the proof that lim (3x - 2) = 4 by filling in the blanks.

                                                          x2

        Let _______.
        Choose  = _______.
        Assume 0 < |x - ____| < ____.
        Thus,
         |_______ - ____| = ______________________________.
        Therefore, lim (3x - 2) = 4.

                           x2

In Example 2.39 and Example 2.40, the proofs were fairly straightforward, since the functions with which we were
working were linear. In Example 2.41, we see how to modify the proof to accommodate a nonlinear function.

Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function (Geometric Approach)

Prove that lim x2 = 4.

                x2

Solution

    1. Let  > 0. The first part of the definition begins "For every  > 0," so we must prove that whatever
         follows is true no matter what positive value of  is chosen. By stating "Let  > 0," we signal our intent
         to do so.

2. Without loss of generality, assume   4. Two questions present themselves: Why do we want   4
    and why is it okay to make this assumption? In answer to the first question: Later on, in the process of

    solving for , we will discover that  involves the quantity 4 - . Consequently, we need   4. In
    answer to the second question: If we can find  > 0 that "works" for   4, then it will "work" for any
      > 4 as well. Keep in mind that, although it is always okay to put an upper bound on , it is never okay
    to put a lower bound (other than zero) on .

3.  Choose            =               4 - ,           4  +    -       Figure     2.41 shows how we made this choice of  .

                         min2 -                                  2.

                         Figure 2.41 This graph shows how we find  geometrically for a given 
                         for the proof in Example 2.41.

4. We must show: If 0 < |x - 2| < , then |x2 - 4| < , so we must begin by assuming
                                                       0 < |x - 2| < .

    We don't really need 0 < |x - 2| (in other words,                                   x  2)  for this proof. Since
    0 < |x - 2| <   |x - 2| < , it is okay to drop 0 < |x - 2|.

                                                         |x - 2| < .

    Hence,

                                                                      - < x - 2 < .

    Recall that                   =                -  4 - ,      4  +    -       Thus,  2- 4-  and consequently

                                      min2                                  2.

                                - .   We also use                      4+-2      here. We might ask at this point: Why did we

    -2 -            4 -  

    substitute 2 - 4 -  for  on the left-hand side of the inequality and 4 +  - 2 on the right-hand
    side of the inequality? If we look at Figure 2.41, we see that 2 - 4 -  corresponds to the distance on
200                                                                                                  Chapter 2 | Limits

     the left of 2 on the x-axis and 4 +  - 2 corresponds to the distance on the right. Thus,

                                                            - < x-2 <                     4 +  - 2.

                                          -2 -  4 -  

     We simplify the expression on the left:
                                            -2 + 4 -  < x - 2 < 4 +  - 2.

     Then, we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
                                                      4 -  < x < 4 + .

     We square all parts of the inequality. It is okay to do so, since all parts of the inequality are positive:
                                                     4 -  < x2 < 4 + .

     We subtract 4 from all parts of the inequality:
                                                       - < x2 - 4 < .

         Last,                                              |x2 - 4| < .
     5. Therefore,                                          lim x2 = 4.

                                                            x2

     2.28 Find  corresponding to  > 0 for a proof that lim x = 3.

                                                                                      x9

The geometric approach to proving that the limit of a function takes on a specific value works quite well for some functions.
Also, the insight into the formal definition of the limit that this method provides is invaluable. However, we may also
approach limit proofs from a purely algebraic point of view. In many cases, an algebraic approach may not only provide
us with additional insight into the definition, it may prove to be simpler as well. Furthermore, an algebraic approach is the
primary tool used in proofs of statements about limits. For Example 2.42, we take on a purely algebraic approach.

   Example 2.42

     Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function (Algebraic Approach)

     Solution
     Let's use our outline from the Problem-Solving Strategy:

         1. Let  > 0.
         2. Choose  = min{1, /5}. This choice of  may appear odd at first glance, but it was obtained by

                                                                        2                    
           | | taking a look at our ultimate desired inequality:                                                This inequality is equivalent
                                                                        x - 2x + 3 - 6                 < .

           to |x + 1| · |x - 3| < . At this point, the temptation simply to choose  =  is very strong.

                                                                                                         x-3

           Unfortunately, our choice of  must depend on  only and no other variable. If we can replace |x - 3| by

           a numerical value, our problem can be resolved. This is the place where assuming   1 comes into play.

           The choice of   1 here is arbitrary. We could have just as easily used any other positive number. In

           some proofs, greater care in this choice may be necessary. Now, since   1 and |x + 1| <   1, we
           are able to show that |x - 3| < 5. Consequently, |x + 1| · |x - 3| < |x + 1| · 5. At this point we realize

           that we also need   /5. Thus, we choose  = min{1, /5}.

       3. Assume 0 < |x + 1| < . Thus,

                                                       |x + 1| < 1 and |x + 1| < .

                                                                                    5

           Since |x + 1| < 1, we may conclude that -1 < x + 1 < 1. Thus, by subtracting 4 from all parts of the

           inequality, we obtain -5 < x - 3 < -1. Consequently, |x - 3| < 5. This gives us

                                      |x2     -    2x  +      -  6|  =  |x  +  1|  ·  |x  -  3|  <     ·  5  =  .
                                                                                                    5

           Therefore,

                                                          lim    2      -   2x  +         =  6.

                                                                 x                    3

       2.29 Complete the proof that lim x2 = 1.

                                                      x1

       Let  > 0; choose  = min{1, /3}; assume 0 < |x - 1| < .

       Since |x - 1| < 1, we may conclude that -1 < x - 1 < 1. Thus, 1 < x + 1 < 3. Hence, |x + 1| < 3.

You will find that, in general, the more complex a function, the more likely it is that the algebraic approach is the easiest to
apply. The algebraic approach is also more useful in proving statements about limits.

Proving Limit Laws

We now demonstrate how to use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to construct a rigorous proof of one of the limit laws.
The triangle inequality is used at a key point of the proof, so we first review this key property of absolute value.

Definition

The triangle inequality states that if a and b are any real numbers, then |a + b|  |a| + |b|.

Proof

We prove the following limit law: If  lim  f  (x)  =   L  and    xlimag(x) =       M,        then   lim         (x)  +  g(x)  =  L  +  M.
                                                                                                    xa
                                      xa                                                                     f

Let  > 0.

Choose 1 > 0 so that if 0 < |x - a| < 1, then | f (x) - L| < /2.

Choose 2 > 0 so that if 0 < |x - a| < 2, then |g(x) - M| < /2.
202                                                                                                               Chapter 2 | Limits

Choose   = min1,                 

                           2.

Assume 0 < |x - a| < .
Thus,

                                              0 < |x - a| < 1 and 0 < |x - a| < 2.

Hence,

                                      f  (x)  +  g(x)  -  (L  +  M)|     =        f  (x)  -       +  g(x)  -  M|

                                                                          | f (x) - L| + |g(x) - M|
                                                                         <  +  = .
                                                                              22



We now explore what it means for a limit not to exist. The limit xlima f (x) does not exist if there is no real number L for

which   lim  f  (x)  =  L.  Thus, for all real numbers L,     lim     f  (x)         L.   To understand what this means, we look at each part

        xa                                                    xa

of the definition of xlima f (x) = L together with its opposite. A translation of the definition is given in Table 2.10.

  3. if 0 < |x - a| < , then                              3. There is an x satisfying 0 < |x - a| <  so that

  | f (x) - L| < .                                        | f (x) - L|  .

                                                 xa

Finally, we may state what it means for a limit not to exist. The limit xlima f (x) does not exist if for every real number L,

there exists a real number  > 0 so that for all  > 0, there is an x satisfying 0 < |x - a| < , so that | f (x) - L|  .

Let's apply this in Example 2.43 to show that a limit does not exist.

Solution
Suppose that L is a candidate for a limit. Choose  = 1/2.
Let  > 0. Either L  0 or L < 0. If L  0, then let x = - /2. Thus,

                                               | | |x - 0| = -  - 0 =  < 2 2

and

                                     || |- 2|  -L  =  |-1 - L|    =  L+1         1  >  1  =  .

On the other hand, if L < 0,    then let x = /2. Thus,

                                                   | | |x - 0| =  - 0 =  < 22

and

                                        | ||2| -L  =  |1 - L|  =  |L| + 1     1  >  1  =  .
                                           22
                                         

Thus, for any value of L,  lim  |x|        L.

One-Sided and Infinite Limits

Just as we first gained an intuitive understanding of limits and then moved on to a more rigorous definition of a limit,
we now revisit one-sided limits. To do this, we modify the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to give formal epsilon-delta
definitions for limits from the right and left at a point. These definitions only require slight modifications from the definition
of the limit. In the definition of the limit from the right, the inequality 0 < x - a <  replaces 0 < |x - a| < , which
ensures that we only consider values of x that are greater than (to the right of) a. Similarly, in the definition of the limit from
the left, the inequality - < x - a < 0 replaces 0 < |x - a| < , which ensures that we only consider values of x that
are less than (to the left of) a.

       Proving a Statement about a Limit From the Right

       Prove that lim x - 4 = 0.

                        x  4+

       Solution
       Let  > 0.

      Choose  = 2. Since we ultimately want | x - 4 - 0| < , we manipulate this inequality to get x - 4 < 

       or, equivalently, 0 < x - 4 < 2, making  = 2 a clear choice. We may also determine  geometrically, as
       shown in Figure 2.42.

                    Figure 2.42 This graph shows how we find  for the proof in
                    Example 2.44.

     Assume 0 < x - 4 < . Thus, 0 < x - 4 < 2. Hence, 0 <  x - 4 < . Finally, | x - 4 - 0| < .
     Therefore, lim x - 4 = 0.

to get larger and larger as x approaches a. Instead of the requirement that | f (x) - L| <  for arbitrarily small  when

0 < |x - a| <  for small enough , we want f (x) > M for arbitrarily large positive M when 0 < |x - a| <  for small

enough . Figure 2.43 illustrates this idea by showing the value of  for successively larger values of M.

KEY CONCEPTS

2.1 A Preview of Calculus

     · Differential calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of determining the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a
        point. The slope of the tangent line indicates the rate of change of the function, also called the derivative. Calculating
        a derivative requires finding a limit.

     · Integral calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of finding the area of a region between the graph of a
        function and the x-axis. We can approximate the area by dividing it into thin rectangles and summing the areas of
        these rectangles. This summation leads to the value of a function called the integral. The integral is also calculated
        by finding a limit and, in fact, is related to the derivative of a function.

     · Multivariable calculus enables us to solve problems in three-dimensional space, including determining motion in
        space and finding volumes of solids.

2.2 The Limit of a Function

     · A table of values or graph may be used to estimate a limit.
     · If the limit of a function at a point does not exist, it is still possible that the limits from the left and right at that point

         may exist.
     · If the limits of a function from the left and right exist and are equal, then the limit of the function is that common

         value.
     · We may use limits to describe infinite behavior of a function at a point.

2.3 The Limit Laws

     · The limit laws allow us to evaluate limits of functions without having to go through step-by-step processes each
        time.

     ·  For polynomials and rational functions,  lim  f  (x)  =  f (a).

Chapter 2 | Limits                                                          211

      · You can evaluate the limit of a function by factoring and canceling, by multiplying by a conjugate, or by simplifying
         a complex fraction.

      · The squeeze theorem allows you to find the limit of a function if the function is always greater than one function
         and less than another function with limits that are known.

2.4 Continuity

      · For a function to be continuous at a point, it must be defined at that point, its limit must exist at the point, and the
         value of the function at that point must equal the value of the limit at that point.

      · Discontinuities may be classified as removable, jump, or infinite.

      · A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. It is continuous over
         a closed interval if it is continuous at every point in its interior and is continuous at its endpoints.

      · The composite function theorem states: If f (x) is continuous at L and xlimag(x) = L, then

      lim  f        g(x)  =                  f (L).

      xa                     f  lim  g(x) =
                             xa

      · The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that if a function is continuous over a closed interval, then the function
         takes on every value between the values at its endpoints.

2.5 The Precise Definition of a Limit

     · The intuitive notion of a limit may be converted into a rigorous mathematical definition known as the epsilon-delta
         definition of the limit.

     · The epsilon-delta definition may be used to prove statements about limits.
     · The epsilon-delta definition of a limit may be modified to define one-sided limits.

Introduction

The Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the world. In 2014, it reached a record-setting speed of 270.49 mph.
It can go from 0 to 200 mph in 14.51 seconds. The techniques in this chapter can be used to calculate the acceleration the
Venom achieves in this feat (see Example 3.8.)
Calculating velocity and changes in velocity are important uses of calculus, but it is far more widespread than that. Calculus
is important in all branches of mathematics, science, and engineering, and it is critical to analysis in business and health as
214                                                                                      Chapter 3 | Derivatives

well. In this chapter, we explore one of the main tools of calculus, the derivative, and show convenient ways to calculate
derivatives. We apply these rules to a variety of functions in this chapter so that we can then explore applications of these
techniques.

3.1 | Defining the Derivative

            Learning Objectives

     3.1.1  Recognize the meaning of the tangent to a curve at a point.
     3.1.2  Calculate the slope of a tangent line.
     3.1.3  Identify the derivative as the limit of a difference quotient.
     3.1.4  Calculate the derivative of a given function at a point.
     3.1.5  Describe the velocity as a rate of change.
     3.1.6  Explain the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.
     3.1.7  Estimate the derivative from a table of values.

Now that we have both a conceptual understanding of a limit and the practical ability to compute limits, we have established
the foundation for our study of calculus, the branch of mathematics in which we compute derivatives and integrals.
Most mathematicians and historians agree that calculus was developed independently by the Englishman Isaac Newton
(1643-1727) and the German Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), whose images appear in Figure 3.2. When we credit

Newton and Leibniz with developing calculus, we are really referring to the fact that Newton and Leibniz were the first
to understand the relationship between the derivative and the integral. Both mathematicians benefited from the work of
predecessors, such as Barrow, Fermat, and Cavalieri. The initial relationship between the two mathematicians appears to
have been amicable; however, in later years a bitter controversy erupted over whose work took precedence. Although it
seems likely that Newton did, indeed, arrive at the ideas behind calculus first, we are indebted to Leibniz for the notation
that we commonly use today.

Figure 3.2 Newton and Leibniz are credited with developing calculus independently.

Tangent Lines

We begin our study of calculus by revisiting the notion of secant lines and tangent lines. Recall that we used the slope of

a secant line to a function at a point (a, f (a)) to estimate the rate of change, or the rate at which one variable changes in

relation to another variable. We can obtain the slope of the secant by choosing a value of x near a and drawing a line

through the points       (a,  f (a))  and      f  (  x      as shown in Figure 3.3. The slope of this line is given by an equation in the

                                           x,           ),

form of a difference quotient:

                                                                    f (x) - f (a)
                                                          msec = x - a .

We can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value a by using this equation and replacing x with
a + h, where h is a value close to 0. We can then calculate the slope of the line through the points (a, f (a)) and
(a + h, f (a + h)). In this case, we find the secant line has a slope given by the following difference quotient with
increment h:

                                               msec = f (a + h) - f (a) a + h - a = f (a + h) - f (a) h .

Definition
Let f be a function defined on an interval I containing a. If x  a is in I, then

Also, if h  0 is chosen so that a + h is in I, then

These two expressions for calculating the slope of a secant line are illustrated in Figure 3.3. We will see that each of these
two methods for finding the slope of a secant line is of value. Depending on the setting, we can choose one or the other. The
primary consideration in our choice usually depends on ease of calculation.
216  Chapter 3 | Derivatives

        Figure 3.3 We can calculate the slope of a secant line in either of two ways.
In Figure 3.4(a) we see that, as the values of x approach a, the slopes of the secant lines provide better estimates of the
rate of change of the function at a. Furthermore, the secant lines themselves approach the tangent line to the function at
a, which represents the limit of the secant lines. Similarly, Figure 3.4(b) shows that as the values of h get closer to 0,
the secant lines also approach the tangent line. The slope of the tangent line at a is the rate of change of the function at a,
as shown in Figure 3.4(c).

 Figure 3.4 The secant lines approach the tangent line (shown in green) as the second point approaches the first.
       You can use this site (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_diffmicros) to explore graphs to see if they have a
       tangent line at a point.

In Figure 3.5 we show the graph of f (x) = x and its tangent line at (1, 1) in a series of tighter intervals about x = 1.
As the intervals become narrower, the graph of the function and its tangent line appear to coincide, making the values on
the tangent line a good approximation to the values of the function for choices of x close to 1. In fact, the graph of f (x)
itself appears to be locally linear in the immediate vicinity of x = 1.

       Figure 3.5 For values of x close to 1, the graph of f (x) = x and its tangent line appear to coincide.

Formally we may define the tangent line to the graph of a function as follows.

Definition

Let f (x) be a function defined in an open interval containing a. The tangent line to f (x) at a is the line passing

through the point            f (a)  having slope

                         a,

                                                  m tan  =  lim     f (x) - f (a)                                           (3.3)

provided this limit exists.

Equivalently, we may define the tangent line to          f (x)  at  a  to be the line passing through the point      f (a)  having

                                                                                                                 a,

                                                  mtan = lim f (a + h) - f (a)                                              (3.4)

provided this limit exists.

Just as we have used two different expressions to define the slope of a secant line, we use two different forms to define the
slope of the tangent line. In this text we use both forms of the definition. As before, the choice of definition will depend
on the setting. Now that we have formally defined a tangent line to a function at a point, we can use this definition to find
equations of tangent lines.

     Example 3.1

       Finding a Tangent Line

     Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f (x) = x2 at x = 3.

     Solution
     First find the slope of the tangent line. In this example, use Equation 3.3.

     mtan = lim f (x) - f (3)                               Apply the definition.
               x3 x-3                                       Substitute f (x) = x2 and f (3) = 9.
                                                            Factor the numerator to evaluate the limit.
                    = lim x2 - 9
                      x3 x-3

                    = lim (x - 3)(x + 3) = lim (x + 3) = 6
                    x3 x-3                       x3

     Next, find a point on the tangent line. Since the line is tangent to the graph of f (x) at x = 3, it passes through

     the point      f (3).  We have  f (3) = 9,  so the tangent line passes through the point (3, 9).

                3,

     Using the point-slope equation of the line with the slope m = 6 and the point (3, 9), we obtain the line
     y - 9 = 6(x - 3). Simplifying, we have y = 6x - 9. The graph of f (x) = x2 and its tangent line at 3 are
     shown in Figure 3.6.

                                   Figure 3.6 The tangent line to f (x) at x = 3.

   Example 3.2

     The Slope of a Tangent Line Revisited
     Use Equation 3.4 to find the slope of the line tangent to the graph of f (x) = x2 at x = 3.
     Solution

      The steps are very similar to Example 3.1. See Equation 3.4 for the definition.

    mtan = lim f (3 + h) - f (3)        h                         Apply the definition.
                         h0                                       Substitute f (3 + h) = (3 + h)2 and f (3) = 9.
                                                                  Expand and simplify to evaluate the limit.
                         = lim (3 + h)2 - 9h
                         h0

                         = lim 9 + 6h + h2 - 9h
                         h0

                         = lim h(6 + h) = lim (6 + h) = 6
                         h0 h              h0

We obtained the same value for the slope of the tangent line by using the other definition, demonstrating that the
formulas can be interchanged.

Example 3.3

  Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f (x) = 1/x at x = 2.

Solution
We can use Equation 3.3, but as we have seen, the results are the same if we use Equation 3.4.

                         mtan = lim f (x) - f (2)          Apply the definition.
                                   x2 x-2
                                         1-1               Substitute  f (x)  =  1  and  f (2)  =  21.
                                                                                 x

                                = lim x 2 · 2x
                                   x  2 x - 2 2x           Simplify.

                                = lim (2 - x)              Simplify using 2 - x = -1, for x  2.
                                   x  2(x - 2)(2x)                           x-2

                                = lim -1                   Evaluate the limit.
                                   x  2 2x

                                = -1
                                       4

We now know that the slope of the tangent line is - 1. To find the equation of the tangent line, we also need a

point on the line. We know that f (2) = 1. Since the tangent line passes through the point (2, 1) we can use22

the point-slope equation of a line to find the equation of the tangent line. Thus the tangent line has the equation

The Derivative of a Function at a Point

The type of limit we compute in order to find the slope of the line tangent to a function at a point occurs in many applications
across many disciplines. These applications include velocity and acceleration in physics, marginal profit functions in
business, and growth rates in biology. This limit occurs so frequently that we give this value a special name: the derivative.
The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

Definition                                                                                        f (x) at a,  denoted
                                                                                                                  (3.5)
Let f (x) be a function defined in an open interval containing a. The derivative of the function
by f  (a), is defined by                                                                                          (3.6)

provided this limit exists.

Alternatively, we may also define the derivative of f (x) at a as

                                f  (a) = lim f (a + h) - f (a).                   h

Velocities and Rates of Change

Now that we can evaluate a derivative, we can use it in velocity applications. Recall that if s(t) is the position of an object
moving along a coordinate axis, the average velocity of the object over a time interval [a, t] if t > a or [t, a] if t < a is
given by the difference quotient

                                                s(t) - s(a)                                                              (3.7)
                                        vave = t - a .

As the values of t approach a, the values of vave approach the value we call the instantaneous velocity at a. That is,
instantaneous velocity at a, denoted v(a), is given by

                                     v(a) = s (a) = lim         s(t) - s(a)            .                                 (3.8)

                                                            ta                    t-a

To better understand the relationship between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, see Figure 3.8. In this figure,
the slope of the tangent line (shown in red) is the instantaneous velocity of the object at time t = a whose position at time
t is given by the function s(t). The slope of the secant line (shown in green) is the average velocity of the object over the

time interval [a, t].

                                       Figure 3.8 The slope of the secant line is the average velocity
                                   over the interval [a, t]. The slope of the tangent line is the
                                       instantaneous velocity.

We can use Equation 3.5 to calculate the instantaneous velocity, or we can estimate the velocity of a moving object by
using a table of values. We can then confirm the estimate by using Equation 3.7.

   Example 3.7

     Estimating Velocity
     A lead weight on a spring is oscillating up and down. Its position at time t with respect to a fixed horizontal
     line is given by s(t) = sin t (Figure 3.9). Use a table of values to estimate v(0). Check the estimate by using

      Equation 3.5.

                                       oscillatory motion.

     Solution
     We can estimate the instantaneous velocity at t = 0 by computing a table of average velocities using values of t
     approaching 0, as shown in Table 3.1.

                               approaching 0

     From the table we see that the average velocity over the time interval [-0.1, 0] is 0.998334166, the average
     velocity over the time interval [-0.01, 0] is 0.9999833333, and so forth. Using this table of values, it appears
     that a good estimate is v(0) = 1.

     By using Equation 3.5, we can see that

                               v(0) = s (0) = lim sint - sin0 = lim sint = 1.

     Thus, in fact, v(0) = 1.

         s(t) = -16t2 + 64, 0  t  2. Find its instantaneous velocity 1 second after it is dropped, using Equation
        3.5.

As we have seen throughout this section, the slope of a tangent line to a function and instantaneous velocity are related
concepts. Each is calculated by computing a derivative and each measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, or
the rate of change of a function at any point along the function.

  Definition
  The instantaneous rate of change of a function f (x) at a value a is its derivative f (a).

  Chapter Opener: Estimating Rate of Change of Velocity

                         Figure 3.10 (credit: modification of work by Codex41,
                         Flickr)

Reaching a top speed of 270.49 mph, the Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the world. In tests it
went from 0 to 60 mph in 3.05 seconds, from 0 to 100 mph in 5.88 seconds, from 0 to 200 mph in 14.51
seconds, and from 0 to 229.9 mph in 19.96 seconds. Use this data to draw a conclusion about the rate of change
of velocity (that is, its acceleration) as it approaches 229.9 mph. Does the rate at which the car is accelerating
appear to be increasing, decreasing, or constant?

Solution                                                                         293.33 ft/s, and 229.9 mph

First observe that 60 mph = 88 ft/s, 100 mph  146.67 ft/s, 200 mph
  337.19 ft/s. We can summarize the information in a table.

     Example 3.9

       Rate of Change of Temperature

     A homeowner sets the thermostat so that the temperature in the house begins to drop from 70°F at 9 p.m.,
     reaches a low of 60° during the night, and rises back to 70° by 7 a.m. the next morning. Suppose that the

     temperature in the house is given by T(t) = 0.4t2 - 4t + 70 for 0  t  10, where t is the number of hours

     past 9 p.m. Find the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature at midnight.

     Solution
     Since midnight is 3 hours past 9 p.m., we want to compute T(3). Refer to Equation 3.5.

     T (3)  = lim T(t) - T(3)                Apply the definition.
              t3 t-3

            = lim 0.4t2 - 4t + 70 - 61.6     Substitute T(t) = 0.4t2 - 4t + 70 and
            t3            t-3                T(3) = 61.6.

            = lim 0.4t2 - 4t + 8.4           Simplify.
            t3      t-3

            = lim 0.4(t - 3)(t - 7)                                               = lim 0.4(t - 3)(t - 7)
            t3           t-3                                                      t3  t-3

            = lim 0.4(t - 7)                 Cancel.

               t3

            = -1.6                           Evaluate the limit.

     The instantaneous rate of change of the temperature at midnight is -1.6°F per hour.

Example 3.10

  Rate of Change of Profit

A toy company can sell x electronic gaming systems at a price of p = -0.01x + 400 dollars per gaming
system. The cost of manufacturing x systems is given by C(x) = 100x + 10,000 dollars. Find the rate of change
of profit when 10,000 games are produced. Should the toy company increase or decrease production?

Solution

The profit P(x) earned by producing x gaming systems is R(x) - C(x), where R(x) is the revenue obtained
from the sale of x games. Since the company can sell x games at p = -0.01x + 400 per game,

                         R(x) = xp = x(-0.01x + 400) = -0.01x2 + 400x.

Consequently,

                                            P(x) = -0.01x2 + 300x - 10,000.
Therefore, evaluating the rate of change of profit gives

                         P (10000)  = lim P(x) - P(10000)
                                      x  10000 x - 10000

                                    = lim -0.01x2 + 300x - 10000 - 1990000
                                    x  10000  x - 10000

                                    = lim -0.01x2 + 300x - 2000000
                                    x  10000  x - 10000

                                    = 100.

Since the rate of change of profit P (10,000) > 0 and P(10,000) > 0, the company should increase
production.

3.2 | The Derivative as a Function

                                        Learning Objectives

     3.2.1  Define the derivative function of a given function.
     3.2.2  Graph a derivative function from the graph of a given function.
     3.2.3  State the connection between derivatives and continuity.
     3.2.4  Describe three conditions for when a function does not have a derivative.
     3.2.5  Explain the meaning of a higher-order derivative.

As we have seen, the derivative of a function at a given point gives us the rate of change or slope of the tangent line to the
function at that point. If we differentiate a position function at a given time, we obtain the velocity at that time. It seems
reasonable to conclude that knowing the derivative of the function at every point would produce valuable information about
the behavior of the function. However, the process of finding the derivative at even a handful of values using the techniques
of the preceding section would quickly become quite tedious. In this section we define the derivative function and learn a
process for finding it.

Derivative Functions

The derivative function gives the derivative of a function at each point in the domain of the original function for which the
derivative is defined. We can formally define a derivative function as follows.

Definition

Let f be a function. The derivative function, denoted by f , is the function whose domain consists of those values
of x such that the following limit exists:

                                        f  (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x).                (3.9)

                                        h0                                        h

A function f (x) is said to be differentiable at a if f (a) exists. More generally, a function is said to be differentiable
on S if it is differentiable at every point in an open set S, and a differentiable function is one in which f (x) exists on
its domain.
In the next few examples we use Equation 3.9 to find the derivative of a function.

   Example 3.11

     Finding the Derivative of a Square-Root Function

     Find the derivative of f (x) = x.

     Solution
     Start directly with the definition of the derivative function. Use Equation 3.1.

        3.6 Find the derivative of f (x) = x2.

We use a variety of different notations to express the derivative of a function. In Example 3.12 we showed that if

f (x) = x2 - 2x, then f  (x) = 2x - 2. If we had expressed this function in the form y = x2 - 2x, we could have

expressed the derivative as y = 2x - 2 or dydx = 2x - 2. We could have conveyed the same information by writing

d   2   -        =  2x   -  2.  Thus, for the function  y=  f (x),  each of the following notations represents the derivative of
dx
    x      2x

f (x):

     dx dx

| In place of f  (a) we may also use dydx x = a Use of the dydx notation (called Leibniz notation) is quite common in

engineering and physics. To understand this notation better, recall that the derivative of a function at a point is the limit of
the slopes of secant lines as the secant lines approach the tangent line. The slopes of these secant lines are often expressed

in the form y x where y is the difference in the y values corresponding to the difference in the x values, which are
expressed as x (Figure 3.11). Thus the derivative, which can be thought of as the instantaneous rate of change of y

with respect to x, is expressed as

     dy = lim y.

                                   Figure 3.11 The derivative is expressed as dy = lim y.

Graphing a Derivative

We have already discussed how to graph a function, so given the equation of a function or the equation of a derivative
function, we could graph it. Given both, we would expect to see a correspondence between the graphs of these two
functions, since f (x) gives the rate of change of a function f (x) (or slope of the tangent line to f (x)).
In Example 3.11 we found that for f (x) = x, f (x) = 1/2 x. If we graph these functions on the same axes, as in Figure
3.12, we can use the graphs to understand the relationship between these two functions. First, we notice that f (x) is
increasing over its entire domain, which means that the slopes of its tangent lines at all points are positive. Consequently,
we expect f  (x) > 0 for all values of x in its domain. Furthermore, as x increases, the slopes of the tangent lines to f (x)
are decreasing and we expect to see a corresponding decrease in f (x). We also observe that f (0) is undefined and that

  lim f  (x) = +, corresponding to a vertical tangent to f (x) at 0.

increasing and f  (x) > 0. Also, f (x) has a horizontal tangent at x = 1 and f  (1) = 0.

Derivatives and Continuity

Now that we can graph a derivative, let's examine the behavior of the graphs. First, we consider the relationship between
differentiability and continuity. We will see that if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous there;

Chapter 3 | Derivatives                                                                                                                               237

however, a function that is continuous at a point need not be differentiable at that point. In fact, a function may be continuous
at a point and fail to be differentiable at the point for one of several reasons.

  Theorem 3.1: Differentiability Implies Continuity
  Let f (x) be a function and a be in its domain. If f (x) is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.

Proof
If f (x) is differentiable at a, then f (a) exists and

                                                                       f    (a)  =   lim  f (x) - f (a)       .
                                                                                                 x-a
                                                                                     xa

We want to show that     f (x)     is continuous at           a        by showing that        lim     f  (x)     =  f (a).  Thus,

                                                                                              xa

xlima f (x)  =           lim    f  (  x  )  -  f (a)  +    f         
                         xa   
                                                              (a)

                               f (x) - f (a)                                        
             = xlima x - a · (x - a) + f (a)                                                             Multiply and divide f (x) - f (a) by x - a.

                          f (x) - f (a)                    xlima(x               a)              (a)
             = xlima                     x-a            ·                   -        +  lim   f

                                                                                        xa

             = f (a) · 0 + f (a)

             = f (a).

Therefore, since f (a) is defined and xlima f (x) = f (a), we conclude that f is continuous at a.



We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity, but now we consider whether continuity implies
differentiability. To determine an answer to this question, we examine the function f (x) = |x|. This function is continuous
everywhere; however, f (0) is undefined. This observation leads us to believe that continuity does not imply
differentiability. Let's explore further. For f (x) = |x|,

                                               f  (0) = lim f (x) - f (0) = lim |x| - |0| = lim |x|.
                                                              x0 x-0                          x0 x-0 x0x

This limit does not exist because                             lim-          |x|  =   -1  and     lim     |x| = 1.

                                   Figure 3.14 The function f (x) = |x| is continuous at 0 but
                                   is not differentiable at 0.

Let's consider some additional situations in which a continuous function fails to be differentiable. Consider the function
 f (x) = 3 x:

                                               f  (0) = lim 3 x - 0 = lim 1 = +.
                                                         x  0 x - 0 x  03 2
                                                                                  x

Thus f  (0) does not exist. A quick look at the graph of f (x) = 3 x clarifies the situation. The function has a vertical
tangent line at 0 (Figure 3.15).

                             Figure 3.15 The function f (x) = 3 x has a vertical tangent at
                             x = 0. It is continuous at 0 but is not differentiable at 0.

The function f (x) = x  sin  1  if  x    0  also has a derivative that exhibits interesting behavior at 0. We see that
                             x
     0 if x = 0

                                         f  (0) = lim  x sin(1/x) - 0                 1
                                            x0 x-0                                = lim sin x.
                                                                                  x0

This limit does not exist, essentially because the slopes of the secant lines continuously change direction as they approach
zero (Figure 3.16).

In summary:

1. We observe that if a function is not continuous, it cannot be differentiable, since every differentiable function must
     be continuous. However, if a function is continuous, it may still fail to be differentiable.

2. We saw that f (x) = |x| failed to be differentiable at 0 because the limit of the slopes of the tangent lines on the

    left and right were not the same. Visually, this resulted in a sharp corner on the graph of the function at 0. From
     this we conclude that in order to be differentiable at a point, a function must be "smooth" at that point.

3. As we saw in the example of f (x) = 3 x, a function fails to be differentiable at a point where there is a vertical
     tangent line.

4. As we saw with f (x) =    x  sin  1  if  x    0  a function may fail to be differentiable at a point in more complicated
                                     x
                             0 if x = 0

ways as well.

to a straight line (Figure 3.17). The function that describes the track is to have the form

f (x) both continuous and differentiable.

                          Figure 3.17 For the car to move smoothly along the track, the
                          function must be both continuous and differentiable.

     Solution
     For the function to be continuous at x = -10, lim - f (x) = f (-10). Thus, since

                                                                         x  10

                                  lim - f (x) = 1 (-10)2 - 10b + c = 10 - 10b + c
                                x  -10              10

     and f (-10) = 5, we must have 10 - 10b + c = 5. Equivalently, we have c = 10b - 5.

     For the function to be differentiable at -10,

                                                   f  (10) = lim f (x) - f (-10)

     must exist. Since f (x) is defined using different rules on the right and the left, we must evaluate this limit from
     the right and the left and then set them equal to each other:

          lim - f (x) - f (-10) =                   1 x2 + bx + c - 5
                          x + 10            lim 10

          x  -10                        x  -10             x + 10

Higher-Order Derivatives

The derivative of a function is itself a function, so we can find the derivative of a derivative. For example, the derivative
of a position function is the rate of change of position, or velocity. The derivative of velocity is the rate of change of
velocity, which is acceleration. The new function obtained by differentiating the derivative is called the second derivative.
Furthermore, we can continue to take derivatives to obtain the third derivative, fourth derivative, and so on. Collectively,
these are referred to as higher-order derivatives. The notation for the higher-order derivatives of y = f (x) can be

expressed in any of the following forms:

                                                    f (x), f (x), f (4) (x),..., f (n) (x)

                                                    y(x), y(x), y(4) (x),..., y(n) (x)

Solution
First find f (x).

                                                                                           f (x + h) = 2(x + h)2 - 3(x + h) + 1
f  (x) = lim                 2(x                              1

                         h0                            h

                                                                                           into f  (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x).h
                                                                                                  h0

= lim 4xh + 2h2 - 3h                 h                                                     Simplify the numerator.

                                                                                           and cancel with the h in the

              = 4x - 3
Next, find f (x) by taking the derivative of f  (x) = 4x - 3.

f (x) = lim f  (x + h) - f (x)                                            Use f  (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x) with f (x) inh

                          = lim 4(x + h) - 3 - (4x - 3)                   Substitute f  (x + h) = 4(x + h) - 3 and

                         h0                    h                          f  (x) = 4x - 3.

  Finding Acceleration

The position of a particle along a coordinate axis at time t (in seconds) is given by s(t) = 3t2 - 4t + 1 (in
meters). Find the function that describes its acceleration at time t.

Solution
Since v(t) = s(t) and a(t) = v (t) = s(t), we begin by finding the derivative of s(t) :

                   s (t) = lim s(t + h) - s(t)      h
                                        h0

                                            3(t  +  h)  2  -  4(t  +                 h)  +  1  -      2  -  4t  +    

                        = lim                                                                     3t               1

                                        h0                                           h

                        = 6t - 4.

Next,

                                        s(t) = lim s (t + h) - s(t)               h
                                                 h0

                                            = lim 6(t + h) - 4 - (6t - 4)            h
                                                 h0

                                            = 6.

Thus, a = 6 m/s2.

while similar, is more complicated. In this section, we develop rules for finding derivatives that allow us to bypass this

process. We begin with the basics.

The Basic Rules

The functions f (x) = c and g(x) = xn where n is a positive integer are the building blocks from which all polynomials

and rational functions are constructed. To find derivatives of polynomials and rational functions efficiently without resorting
to the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for differentiating these basic functions.

The Constant Rule

We first apply the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the constant function, f (x) = c. For this
function, both f (x) = c and f (x + h) = c, so we obtain the following result:

                                            f  (x)  = lim f (x + h) - f (x)h
                                                    h0
                                                    = lim c - c
                                                    h0 h

                                                    = lim 0
                                                      h  0h

                                                    = lim 0 = 0.

                                                       h0

The rule for differentiating constant functions is called the constant rule. It states that the derivative of a constant function

is zero; that is, since a constant function is a horizontal line, the slope, or the rate of change, of a constant function is 0. We
restate this rule in the following theorem.

Theorem 3.2: The Constant Rule
Let c be a constant.
If f (x) = c, then f (c) = 0.
Alternatively, we may express this rule as

                                                    d (c) = 0.
                                                    dx

     Applying the Constant Rule

     Find the derivative of f (x) = 8.

     Solution
     This is just a one-step application of the rule:

                                                       f (x) = 0.

The Power Rule

We have shown that

                         d x2 = 2x and d x1/2 = 1 x-1/2.

At this point, you might see a pattern beginning to develop for derivatives of the form d (xn). We continue our
                                                                                                              dx

examination of derivative formulas by differentiating power functions of the form f (x) = xn where n is a positive integer.

We develop formulas for derivatives of this type of function in stages, beginning with positive integer powers. Before stating

and proving the general rule for derivatives of functions of this form, we take a look at a specific case, d (x3). As we go
                                                                                                                        dx

through this derivation, note that the technique used in this case is essentially the same as the technique used to prove the
general case.

                                                            other terms contain powers of h that are two or

As we shall see, the procedure for finding the derivative of the general form f (x) = xn is very similar. Although it is often

unwise to draw general conclusions from specific examples, we note that when we differentiate f (x) = x3, the power on

x becomes the coefficient of x2 in the derivative and the power on x in the derivative decreases by 1. The following
theorem states that the power rule holds for all positive integer powers of x. We will eventually extend this result to
negative integer powers. Later, we will see that this rule may also be extended first to rational powers of x and then to
arbitrary powers of x. Be aware, however, that this rule does not apply to functions in which a constant is raised to a
variable power, such as f (x) = 3x.

Theorem 3.3: The Power Rule                       f  (x) = nxn - 1.
Let n be a positive integer. If f (x) = xn, then  d xn = nxn - 1.
                                                  dx
Alternatively, we may express this rule as

Proof

For f (x) = xn where n is a positive integer, we have

                                                  f  (x) = lim (x + h)n - xn.h
                                                       h0

                 Since (x + h)n = xn + nxn - 1 h + n xn - 2 h2 + n xn - 3 h3 + ... + nxhn - 1 + hn,
                                                  2         3

we see that
250                                                                                                           Chapter 3 | Derivatives

            (x + h)n - xn = nxn - 1 h + n xn - 2 h2 + n xn - 3 h3 + ... + nxhn - 1 + hn.
                                                             2                    3

Next, divide both sides by h:

                                           n - 1 n n - 2 2 n n - 3 3                                 n-1 n
            (x + h)n - xn          nx h + 2 x h + 3 x h + ... + nxh + h
                   h=                                                                h.

Thus,

            (x + h)n - xn          n - 1 n n - 2 n n - 3 2                                           n-2 n-1
                   h = nx + 2 x h + 3 x h + ... + nxh + h .

Finally,

                   f  (x)       n - 1 n n - 2 n n - 3 2                                              n - 1 n
                               = lim nx +   x h +   x h + ... + nxh + h 2         3
                               h0

                               = nxn - 1.

     Applying the Power Rule

     Find the derivative of the function f (x) = x10 by applying the power rule.

     Solution
     Using the power rule with n = 10, we obtain

                                                      f (x) = 10x10 - 1 = 10x9.

       3.13 Find the derivative of f (x) = x7.

The Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules

We find our next differentiation rules by looking at derivatives of sums, differences, and constant multiples of functions.
Just as when we work with functions, there are rules that make it easier to find derivatives of functions that we add, subtract,
or multiply by a constant. These rules are summarized in the following theorem.

  Theorem 3.4: Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules
  Let f (x) and g(x) be differentiable functions and k be a constant. Then each of the following equations holds.

  Sum Rule. The derivative of the sum of a function f and a function g is the same as the sum of the derivative of f
  and the derivative of g.

                                           d     f  (  x  )  +  g(x)  =  d    f (x)    +  d   g(x);
                                               
                                           dx                            dx               dx

  that is,

                               for j(x) = f (x) + g(x), j (x) = f  (x) + g(x).

  Difference Rule. The derivative of the difference of a function f and a function g is the same as the difference of the

  derivative of f and the derivative of g:

                                            d     f  (  x  )  -   g(x)  =     d   f (x)    -    d  g(x);
                                                
                                            dx                             dx                 dx

  that is,

                                      for j(x) = f (x) - g(x), j (x) = f  (x) - g(x).

  Constant Multiple Rule. The derivative of a constant k multiplied by a function f is the same as the constant multiplied
  by the derivative:

                                                              d   k f (x)  =  k    d   f (x); 

                                                              dx                  dx

  that is,

                                                for j(x) = k f (x), j (x) = k f (x).

Proof
We provide only the proof of the sum rule here. The rest follow in a similar manner.
For differentiable functions f (x) and g(x), we set j(x) = f (x) + g(x). Using the limit definition of the derivative we
have

                                                     j (x) = lim j(x + h) - j(x).     h
                                                                    h0

By substituting j(x + h) = f (x + h) + g(x + h) and j(x) = f (x) + g(x), we obtain

                          j(x) = lim  f (x + h) + g(x + h) -  f (x) + g(x).           h
                                            h0

Rearranging and regrouping the terms, we have

                         j(x) = lim                         f (x + h) - f (x) g(x + h) - g(x)                .
                                                                                      +
                                            h0                      h                                h

We now apply the sum law for limits and the definition of the derivative to obtain

                         j(x) = lim  f (x + h) - f (x)               + lim       g(x + h) - g(x)           = f  (x) + g (x).

                         h0                     h                       h0                    h

  Applying the Constant Multiple Rule

  Find the derivative of g(x) = 3x2 and compare it to the derivative of f (x) = x2.

  Solution
  We use the power rule directly:

                                      g (x) =              d   2    =      3  d    2     =  3(2x)    =  6x.

  Since f (x) = x2 has derivative f  (x) = 2x, we see that the derivative of g(x) is 3 times the derivative of

We begin by applying the rule for differentiating the sum of two functions, followed by the rules for

  Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12
Chapter 3 | Derivatives                                                                                               253

Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f (x) = x2 - 4x + 6 at x = 1.

Solution
To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope. To find the point, compute

                                                 f (1) = 12 - 4(1) + 6 = 3.
This gives us the point (1, 3). Since the slope of the tangent line at 1 is f  (1), we must first find f  (x). Using
the definition of a derivative, we have

                                                        f  (x) = 2x - 4
so the slope of the tangent line is f  (1) = -2. Using the point-slope formula, we see that the equation of the
tangent line is

                                                     y - 3 = -2(x - 1).
Putting the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, we obtain

                                                         y = -2x + 5.

3.15 Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f (x) = 3x2 - 11 at x = 2. Use the point-slope
form.

The Product Rule

Now that we have examined the basic rules, we can begin looking at some of the more advanced rules. The first one
examines the derivative of the product of two functions. Although it might be tempting to assume that the derivative of
the product is the product of the derivatives, similar to the sum and difference rules, the product rule does not follow this
pattern. To see why we cannot use this pattern, consider the function f (x) = x2, whose derivative is f  (x) = 2x and not

 d (x) · d (x) = 1 · 1 = 1.
dx dx

Theorem 3.5: Product Rule
Let f (x) and g(x) be differentiable functions. Then

                         d     f  (  x  )g(  x      =  d    f (x) ·  g(x)  +  d   g(x) ·  f (x).
                             
                         dx                     )      dx                     dx

That is,

                                   if j(x) = f (x)g(x), then j (x) = f  (x)g(x) + g (x) f (x).

This means that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second
function plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.

Proof

We begin by assuming that f (x) and g(x) are differentiable functions. At a key point in this proof we need to use the
fact that, since g(x) is differentiable, it is also continuous. In particular, we use the fact that since g(x) is continuous,

 lim g(x + h) = g(x).

By applying the limit definition of the derivative to j(x) = f (x)g(x), we obtain

                                      j (x) = lim f (x + h)g(x + h) - f (x)g(x).    h
                                         h0

By adding and subtracting f (x)g(x + h) in the numerator, we have

                        j (x) = lim f (x + h)g(x + h) - f (x)g(x + h) + f (x)g(x + h) - f (x)g(x).h
                               h0

After breaking apart this quotient and applying the sum law for limits, the derivative becomes

     j (x) = lim                f (x + h)g(x + h) - f (x)g(x + h)                    + lim       f (x)g(x + h) - f (x)g(x)       .

                           h0            h                                             h0                     h

Rearranging, we obtain

                        j (x) = lim  f (x + h) - f (x)                                    g(x + h) - g(x) 
                                                        · g(x + h) + lim                                               · f (x).
                               h0     h                                                h0               h

By using the continuity of g(x), the definition of the derivatives of f (x) and g(x), and applying the limit laws, we arrive
at the product rule,

                                      j (x) = f  (x)g(x) + g (x) f (x).



     Example 3.23

     Applying the Product Rule to Functions at a Point

     For j(x) = f (x)g(x), use the product rule to find j(2) if f (2) = 3, f  (2) = -4, g(2) = 1, and g (2) = 6.

     Solution
     Since j(x) = f (x)g(x), j (x) = f  (x)g(x) + g (x) f (x), and hence

                                    j (2) = f  (2)g(2) + g (2) f (2) = (-4)(1) + (6)(3) = 14.

     Example 3.24

       Applying the Product Rule to Binomials

     For j(x) = (x2 + 2)(3x3 - 5x), find j(x) by applying the product rule. Check the result by first finding the
     product and then differentiating.

     Solution
     If we set f (x) = x2 + 2 and g(x) = 3x3 - 5x, then f  (x) = 2x and g (x) = 9x2 - 5. Thus,

                        j (x)  =  f  (x)g(x) + g (x) f (x)  =                       3  -        +  (9x  2  -  5)(x  2  +  2).

                                                               (2x)3x                     5x

     Simplifying, we have

                                         j (x) = 15x4 + 3x2 - 10.

Chapter 3 | Derivatives                                                                                       255

To check, we see that j(x) = 3x5 + x3 - 10x and, consequently, j (x) = 15x4 + 3x2 - 10.

3.16      Use the product rule to obtain the derivative of     j(x)   =  2x5  2   +   

                                                                              4x     x.

The Quotient Rule

Having developed and practiced the product rule, we now consider differentiating quotients of functions. As we see in the
following theorem, the derivative of the quotient is not the quotient of the derivatives; rather, it is the derivative of the
function in the numerator times the function in the denominator minus the derivative of the function in the denominator
times the function in the numerator, all divided by the square of the function in the denominator. In order to better grasp
why we cannot simply take the quotient of the derivatives, keep in mind that

                                                           d x3 2
                                  d    2  =  2x,      not  dx   = 3x      = 3x2.
                                  dx                       d (x) 1
                                      x 

                                                           dx

Theorem 3.6: The Quotient Rule
Let f (x) and g(x) be differentiable functions. Then

                         d  f (x)            d ( f (x)) · g(x) - d (g(x)) · f (x)
                                             dx                       dx
                         dxg(x) =                              (g(x))2 .

That is,

                         if j(x) = f (x) g(x) , then j (x) = (g(x))2 f  (x)g(x) - g (x) f (x).

The proof of the quotient rule is very similar to the proof of the product rule, so it is omitted here. Instead, we apply this
new rule for finding derivatives in the next example.

   Example 3.25

     Applying the Quotient Rule

Use the quotient rule to find the derivative of k(x) = 5x2 .
                                                              4x + 3

Solution

Let f (x) = 5x2 and g(x) = 4x + 3. Thus, f  (x) = 10x and g (x) = 4. Substituting into the quotient rule, we
have

     Simplifying, we obtain

It is now possible to use the quotient rule to extend the power rule to find derivatives of functions of the form xk where k
is a negative integer.

Theorem 3.7: Extended Power Rule
If k is a negative integer, then

                                        d xk = kxk - 1.
                                        dx 

Proof

If k is a negative integer, we may set n = -k, so that n is a positive integer with k = -n. Since for each positive integer
n, x-n = 1n, we may now apply the quotient rule by setting f (x) = 1 and g(x) = xn. In this case, f  (x) = 0 and

            x
g (x) = nxn - 1. Thus,

                                  d (x-n) = 0(x . n) - 1nxn - 1
                                 dx                                               (x n) 2

Simplifying, we see that

                             dxd (x-n) = -nxn - 1 = -nx(n - 1) - 2n = -nx-n - 1.x

                                                     2n

Finally, observe that since k = -n, by substituting we have

                                                             d xk = kxk - 1.

  Using the Extended Power Rule and the Constant Multiple Rule

Use the extended power rule and the constant multiple rule to find the derivative of f (x) = 6x2.

Solution

It may seem tempting to use the quotient rule to find this derivative, and it would certainly not be incorrect to do
so. However, it is far easier to differentiate this function by first rewriting it as f (x) = 6x-2.

                         f  (x)  = d  6  = d 6x-2  Rewrite 6 as 6x-2.

Combining Differentiation Rules

As we have seen throughout the examples in this section, it seldom happens that we are called on to apply just one
differentiation rule to find the derivative of a given function. At this point, by combining the differentiation rules, we may
find the derivatives of any polynomial or rational function. Later on we will encounter more complex combinations of
differentiation rules. A good rule of thumb to use when applying several rules is to apply the rules in reverse of the order in
which we would evaluate the function.

     Combining Differentiation Rules

     For k(x) = f (x)g(x)h(x), express k (x) in terms of f (x), g(x), h(x), and their derivatives.

     We can think of the function k(x) as the product of the function f (x)g(x) and the function h(x). That is,

     k(x)  =    f  (  x  )g(  x      ·  h(    x  ).     Thus,

  Determining Where a Function Has a Horizontal Tangent

  Determine the values of x for which f (x) = x3 - 7x2 + 8x + 1 has a horizontal tangent line.

  Solution
  To find the values of x for which f (x) has a horizontal tangent line, we must solve f  (x) = 0. Since

                                          f  (x) = 3x2 - 14x + 8 = (3x - 2)(x - 4),
  we must solve (3x - 2)(x - 4) = 0. Thus we see that the function has horizontal tangent lines at x = 2 and

                                                                                                                            3

Formula One Grandstands

Formula One car races can be very exciting to watch and attract a lot of spectators. Formula One track designers have
to ensure sufficient grandstand space is available around the track to accommodate these viewers. However, car racing
can be dangerous, and safety considerations are paramount. The grandstands must be placed where spectators will not
be in danger should a driver lose control of a car (Figure 3.20).

  Figure 3.20 The grandstand next to a straightaway of the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya race track, located where
  the spectators are not in danger.

Safety is especially a concern on turns. If a driver does not slow down enough before entering the turn, the car may
slide off the racetrack. Normally, this just results in a wider turn, which slows the driver down. But if the driver loses
control completely, the car may fly off the track entirely, on a path tangent to the curve of the racetrack.

Suppose you are designing a new Formula One track. One section of the track can be modeled by the function
 f (x) = x3 + 3x2 + x (Figure 3.21). The current plan calls for grandstands to be built along the first straightaway
and around a portion of the first curve. The plans call for the front corner of the grandstand to be located at the point
(-1.9, 2.8). We want to determine whether this location puts the spectators in danger if a driver loses control of the
car.

      Figure 3.21 (a) One section of the racetrack can be modeled by the function f (x) = x3 + 3x2 + x. (b) The
      front corner of the grandstand is located at (-1.9, 2.8).

     1. Physicists have determined that drivers are most likely to lose control of their cars as they are coming into a
         turn, at the point where the slope of the tangent line is 1. Find the (x, y) coordinates of this point near the turn.

     2. Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at this point.
     3. To determine whether the spectators are in danger in this scenario, find the x-coordinate of the point where the

         tangent line crosses the line y = 2.8. Is this point safely to the right of the grandstand? Or are the spectators
          in danger?
     4. What if a driver loses control earlier than the physicists project? Suppose a driver loses control at the point
          (-2.5, 0.625). What is the slope of the tangent line at this point?

     5. If a driver loses control as described in part 4, are the spectators safe?
     6. Should you proceed with the current design for the grandstand, or should the grandstands be moved?

3.4 | Derivatives as Rates of Change

                                  Learning Objectives

     3.4.1 Determine a new value of a quantity from the old value and the amount of change.
     3.4.2 Calculate the average rate of change and explain how it differs from the instantaneous rate
     of change.

     3.4.4 Predict the future population from the present value and the population growth rate.
     3.4.5 Use derivatives to calculate marginal cost and revenue in a business situation.

In this section we look at some applications of the derivative by focusing on the interpretation of the derivative as the rate of
change of a function. These applications include acceleration and velocity in physics, population growth rates in biology,
and marginal functions in economics.

Amount of Change Formula

One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a function at a point by using a known value of a

function at some given point together with its rate of change at the given point. If f (x) is a function defined on an interval

a, a + h,  then the amount of change of f (x) over the interval is the change in the y values of the function over that

interval and is given by

                          f (a + h) - f (a).

The average rate of change of the function f over that same interval is the ratio of the amount of change over that interval
to the corresponding change in the x values. It is given by

                                                             f (a + h) - f (a) h .
As we already know, the instantaneous rate of change of f (x) at a is its derivative

                          f  (a) = lim f (a + h) - f (a).                         h
                          h0

For small enough values of h, f  (a)  f (a + h) - f (a) h . We can then solve for f (a + h) to get the amount of change
formula:

                          f (a + h)  f (a) + f (a)h.                                                    (3.10)

We can use this formula if we know only f (a) and f (a) and wish to estimate the value of f (a + h). For example, we

may use the current population of a city and the rate at which it is growing to estimate its population in the near future. As
we can see in Figure 3.22, we are approximating f (a + h) by the y coordinate at a + h on the line tangent to f (x) at

x = a. Observe that the accuracy of this estimate depends on the value of h as well as the value of f  (a).

                                       Figure 3.22 The new value of a changed quantity equals the
                                       original value plus the rate of change times the interval of
                                   change: f (a + h)  f (a) + f  (a)h.
       Here is an interesting demonstration (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_chainrule) of rate of change.

   Example 3.33

     Estimating the Value of a Function

     If f (3) = 2 and f  (3) = 5, estimate f (3.2).
     Solution
     Begin by finding h. We have h = 3.2 - 3 = 0.2. Thus,

                                    f (3.2) = f (3 + 0.2)  f (3) + (0.2) f  (3) = 2 + 0.2(5) = 3.

        3.21 Given f (10) = -5 and f  (10) = 6, estimate f (10.1).

Motion along a Line

Another use for the derivative is to analyze motion along a line. We have described velocity as the rate of change of position.
If we take the derivative of the velocity, we can find the acceleration, or the rate of change of velocity. It is also important to
introduce the idea of speed, which is the magnitude of velocity. Thus, we can state the following mathematical definitions.

  Definition
  Let s(t) be a function giving the position of an object at time t.
  The velocity of the object at time t is given by v(t) = s (t).

  The speed of the object at time t is given by |v(t)|.

  The acceleration of the object at t is given by a(t) = v (t) = s(t).
268                                                                                  Chapter 3 | Derivatives

     Example 3.34

       Comparing Instantaneous Velocity and Average Velocity

       A ball is dropped from a height of 64 feet. Its height above ground (in feet) t seconds later is given by
       s(t) = -16t2 + 64.

     a. What is the instantaneous velocity of the ball when it hits the ground?
     b. What is the average velocity during its fall?

     Solution
     The first thing to do is determine how long it takes the ball to reach the ground. To do this, set s(t) = 0. Solving
     -16t2 + 64 = 0, we get t = 2, so it take 2 seconds for the ball to reach the ground.

     a. The instantaneous velocity of the ball as it strikes the ground is v(2). Since v(t) = s (t) = -32t, we
         obtain v(t) = -64 ft/s.

     b. The average velocity of the ball during its fall is

     vave = s(2) - s(0) = 0 - 64 = -32 ft/s.

     Example 3.35

       Interpreting the Relationship between v(t) and a(t)

       A particle moves along a coordinate axis in the positive direction to the right. Its position at time t is given by
       s(t) = t3 - 4t + 2. Find v(1) and a(1) and use these values to answer the following questions.

           a. Is the particle moving from left to right or from right to left at time t = 1 ?
           b. Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at time t = 1 ?

       Solution
       Begin by finding v(t) and a(t).

Evaluating these functions at t = 1, we obtain v(1) = -1 and a(1) = 6.

    a. Because v(1) < 0, the particle is moving from right to left.

    b. Because v(1) < 0 and a(1) > 0, velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite directions. In other
         words, the particle is being accelerated in the direction opposite the direction in which it is traveling,

       causing |v(t)| to decrease. The particle is slowing down.

Example 3.36

  Position and Velocity

  The position of a particle moving along a coordinate axis is given by s(t) = t3 - 9t2 + 24t + 4, t  0.
      a. Find v(t).
       b. At what time(s) is the particle at rest?
       c. On what time intervals is the particle moving from left to right? From right to left?
       d. Use the information obtained to sketch the path of the particle along a coordinate axis.

  Solution
       a. The velocity is the derivative of the position function:
                                                      v(t) = s (t) = 3t2 - 18t + 24.
      b. The particle is at rest when v(t) = 0, so set 3t2 - 18t + 24 = 0. Factoring the left-hand side of the
           equation produces 3(t - 2)(t - 4) = 0. Solving, we find that the particle is at rest at t = 2 and t = 4.
      c. The particle is moving from left to right when v(t) > 0 and from right to left when v(t) < 0. Figure
           3.23 gives the analysis of the sign of v(t) for t  0, but it does not represent the axis along which the
           particle is moving.

                                   Figure 3.23 The sign of v(t) determines the direction of the
                                   particle.

Since 3t2 - 18t + 24 > 0 on [0, 2)  (2, +), the particle is moving from left to right on these
intervals.
Since 3t2 - 18t + 24 < 0 on (2, 4), the particle is moving from right to left on this interval.

d. Before we can sketch the graph of the particle, we need to know its position at the time it starts

moving                      =  0)  and at the times that it changes direction  (t  =  2,  4).  We have  s(0)  =  4,  s(2)  =  24,  and

                         t

s(4) = 20. This means that the particle begins on the coordinate axis at 4 and changes direction at 0 and

     20 on the coordinate axis. The path of the particle is shown on a coordinate axis in Figure 3.24.

     Figure 3.24 The path of the particle can be determined by
     analyzing v(t).

        3.22 A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time t is given by s(t) = t2 - 5t + 1. Is the
        particle moving from right to left or from left to right at time t = 3 ?

Population Change

In addition to analyzing velocity, speed, acceleration, and position, we can use derivatives to analyze various types of
populations, including those as diverse as bacteria colonies and cities. We can use a current population, together with a
growth rate, to estimate the size of a population in the future. The population growth rate is the rate of change of a population
and consequently can be represented by the derivative of the size of the population.

  Definition
  If P(t) is the number of entities present in a population, then the population growth rate of P(t) is defined to be
   P (t).

     Example 3.37

       Estimating a Population

     The population of a city is tripling every 5 years. If its current population is 10,000, what will be its approximate
     population 2 years from now?

     Solution

     Let P(t) be the population (in thousands) t years from now. Thus, we know that P(0) = 10 and based on the
     information, we anticipate P(5) = 30. Now estimate P (0), the current growth rate, using

                                P (0)  P(5) - P(0) = 30 - 10 = 4.5
                                                      5-0

     By applying Equation 3.10 to P(t), we can estimate the population 2 years from now by writing

                                P(2)  P(0) + (2)P (0)  10 + 2(4) = 18;

     thus, in 2 years the population will be 18,000.

        3.23 The current population of a mosquito colony is known to be 3,000; that is, P(0) = 3,000. If
         P (0) = 100, estimate the size of the population in 3 days, where t is measured in days.

Changes in Cost and Revenue

In addition to analyzing motion along a line and population growth, derivatives are useful in analyzing changes in cost,
revenue, and profit. The concept of a marginal function is common in the fields of business and economics and implies the
use of derivatives. The marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function. The marginal revenue is the derivative of the
revenue function. The marginal profit is the derivative of the profit function, which is based on the cost function and the
revenue function.

  Definition

  If C(x) is the cost of producing x items, then the marginal cost MC(x) is MC(x) = C (x).

  If R(x) is the revenue obtained from selling x items, then the marginal revenue MR(x) is MR(x) = R (x).

  If P(x) = R(x) - C(x) is the profit obtained from selling x items, then the marginal profit MP(x) is defined to be
   MP(x) = P (x) = MR(x) - MC(x) = R (x) - C (x).

We can roughly approximate

                            MC(x) = C (x) = lim C(x + h) - C(x)h
                            h0

by choosing an appropriate value for h. Since x represents objects, a reasonable and small value for h is 1. Thus, by
substituting h = 1, we get the approximation MC(x) = C (x)  C(x + 1) - C(x). Consequently, C (x) for a given

value of x can be thought of as the change in cost associated with producing one additional item. In a similar way,
MR(x) = R (x) approximates the revenue obtained by selling one additional item, and MP(x) = P (x) approximates the

profit obtained by producing and selling one additional item.

Example 3.38

Applying Marginal Revenue

Assume that the number of barbeque dinners that can be sold, x, can be related to the price charged, p, by the
equation p(x) = 9 - 0.03x, 0  x  300.
In this case, the revenue in dollars obtained by selling x barbeque dinners is given by

                           R(x) = xp(x) = x(9 - 0.03x) = -0.03x2 + 9x for 0  x  300.
Use the marginal revenue function to estimate the revenue obtained from selling the 101st barbeque dinner.
Compare this to the actual revenue obtained from the sale of this dinner.

Solution
First, find the marginal revenue function: MR(x) = R (x) = -0.06x + 9.
Next, use R (100) to approximate R(101) - R(100), the revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner.
Since R (100) = 3, the revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is approximately $3.
The actual revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is

                                  R(101) - R(100) = 602.97 - 600 = 2.97, or $2.97.
The marginal revenue is a fairly good estimate in this case and has the advantage of being easy to compute.

     P(x) = -0.03x2 + 8x - 50. Use the marginal profit function to estimate the profit from the sale of the 101st
     fish-fry dinner.

3.5.1 Find the derivatives of the sine and cosine function.
3.5.2 Find the derivatives of the standard trigonometric functions.
3.5.3 Calculate the higher-order derivatives of the sine and cosine.

One of the most important types of motion in physics is simple harmonic motion, which is associated with such systems
as an object with mass oscillating on a spring. Simple harmonic motion can be described by using either sine or cosine
functions. In this section we expand our knowledge of derivative formulas to include derivatives of these and other
trigonometric functions. We begin with the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions and then use them to obtain formulas
for the derivatives of the remaining four trigonometric functions. Being able to calculate the derivatives of the sine and
cosine functions will enable us to find the velocity and acceleration of simple harmonic motion.

Derivatives of the Sine and Cosine Functions

We begin our exploration of the derivative for the sine function by using the formula to make a reasonable guess at its
derivative. Recall that for a function f (x),

                         f  (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x).h
                             h0

Consequently, for values of h very close to 0, f  (x)  f (x + h) - f (x) h . We see that by using h = 0.01,

                         d (sin x)  sin(x + 0.01) - sin x
                         dx      0.01

By setting D(x) = sin (x + 0.01) - sin x and using a graphing utility, we can get a graph of an approximation to the
                                 0.01

derivative of sin x (Figure 3.25).

                                   Figure 3.25 The graph of the function D(x) looks a lot like a
                                       cosine curve.

Upon inspection, the graph of D(x) appears to be very close to the graph of the cosine function. Indeed, we will show that
                                                             d (sin x) = cos x.
                                                            dx

If we were to follow the same steps to approximate the derivative of the cosine function, we would find that
278                                                                                               Chapter 3 | Derivatives

The derivative of the sine function is the cosine and the derivative of the cosine function is the negative sine.  (3.12)

                                                       d (sin x) = cos x

                                                      d (cos x) = -sin x
                                                     dx

Proof

Because the proofs for d (sin x) = cos x and d (cos x) = -sin x use similar techniques, we provide only the proof for
                       dx                 dx

d (sin x) = cos x. Before beginning, recall two important trigonometric limits we learned in Introduction to Limits:
dx

                                          lim sinh = 1 and lim cosh - 1 = 0.
                                          h0 h       h0 h

The graphs of y = (sin h) h and y = (cos h - 1) h are shown in Figure 3.26.

       Figure 3.26 These graphs show two important limits needed to establish the derivative formulas for the
       sine and cosine functions.

We also recall the following trigonometric identity for the sine of the sum of two angles:

                                          sin(x + h) = sin x cosh + cos x sinh.

Now that we have gathered all the necessary equations and identities, we proceed with the proof.

     d sin x  = lim sin(x + h) - sin xh              Apply the definition of the derivative.
     dx       h0

Figure 3.27 shows the relationship between the graph of f (x) = sin x and its derivative f  (x) = cos x. Notice that at the
points where f (x) = sin x has a horizontal tangent, its derivative f  (x) = cos x takes on the value zero. We also see that
where f (x) = sin x is increasing, f  (x) = cos x > 0 and where f (x) = sin x is decreasing, f  (x) = cos x < 0.

                          f (x) = 0 that is, f (x) = 0 where f (x) has a horizontal

       An Application to Velocity

     A particle moves along a coordinate axis in such a way that its position at time t is given by s(t) = 2 sin t - t
     for 0  t  2. At what times is the particle at rest?

     Solution
     To determine when the particle is at rest, set s (t) = v(t) = 0. Begin by finding s (t). We obtain

                                                       s (t) = 2cost - 1,

     so we must solve

                                                2cost - 1 = 0 for 0  t  2.

     The solutions to this equation are t =  and t = 5 . Thus the particle is at rest at times t =  and t = 5 .3333

        3.27 A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time t is given by s(t) = 3t + 2 cost for

Since the remaining four trigonometric functions may be expressed as quotients involving sine, cosine, or both, we can use
the quotient rule to find formulas for their derivatives.

Example 3.42

  The Derivative of the Tangent Function

Find the derivative of f (x) = tan x.

Solution
Start by expressing tan x as the quotient of sin x and cos x :

                                           f         (x)  =  tan x  =  sin x .
                                                                       cos x

Now apply the quotient rule to obtain

                                           f  (x) =  cos x cos x - (-sin x)sin x  .
                                                                       2
                                                             (cos x)

Simplifying, we obtain

                                           f  (x) = cos2 x + sin2 x.
                                                          cos2 x

Recognizing that cos2 x + sin2 x = 1, by the Pythagorean theorem, we now have

                                                      f  (x) = 1 .

Finally, use the identity  sec x =    1    to obtain
                                    cos x

                                                      f  (x) = sec2 x.

     Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

     Find the equation of a line tangent to the graph of f (x) = cot x at x = .
                                                                                       4

     Solution
     To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope at that point. To find the point, compute

                                                            4  =  cot             =  1.
                                                      f                4

     Thus the tangent line passes through the point                               Next, find the slope by finding the derivative of
      f (x) = cot x and evaluating it at  :                    4, 1.

                                            4

                         f  (x)  =  -csc2                x  and     4             =  -csc2  4   =  -2.
                                                                 f 
                                                                                              

     Using the point-slope equation of the line, we obtain

                                                      y  -  1  =                  -     
                                                                                     4  
                                                                  -2x

     or equivalently,

                                                      y = -2x + 1 + .
                                                                        2

     Example 3.44

       Finding the Derivative of Trigonometric Functions

     Find the derivative of f (x) = csc x + x tan x.

     Solution
     To find this derivative, we must use both the sum rule and the product rule. Using the sum rule, we find

                                 f  (x) = d (csc x) + d (x tan x).
                                                         dx                       dx

     In the first term, d (csc x) = -csc x cot x, and by applying the product rule to the second term we obtain
                         dx

                         d (x tan x) = (1)(tan x) + (sec2 x)(x).
                         dx

     Therefore, we have

                         f  (x) = -csc x cot x + tan x + x sec2 x.

Higher-Order Derivatives

The higher-order derivatives of sin x and cos x follow a repeating pattern. By following the pattern, we can find any
higher-order derivative of sin x and cos x.

   Example 3.45

     Finding Higher-Order Derivatives of y = sinx

Find the first four derivatives of y = sin x.

Solution
Each step in the chain is straightforward:

                                                  y = sin x

                                                dydx = cos x
                                               dx2 d2 y = -sin x
                                               dx3 d3 y = -cos x
                                               dx4 d4 y = sin x.

Analysis
Once we recognize the pattern of derivatives, we can find any higher-order derivative by determining the step in
the pattern to which it corresponds. For example, every fourth derivative of sin x equals sin x, so

                       ddx44 (sin x) = ddx88 (sin x) = ddx12 12 (sin x) = ... = ddx4n 4n (sin x) = sin x
                       ddx55 (sin x) = ddx99 (sin x) = ddx13 13 (sin x) = ... = ddx4n + 1 4n + 1 (sin x) = cos x.

     Solution
     We can see right away that for the 74th derivative of sin x, 74 = 4(18) + 2, so

                                       ddx74 74 (sin x) = ddx72 + 2 72 + 2 (sin x) = ddx22 (sin x) = -sin x.

       An Application to Acceleration

     A particle moves along a coordinate axis in such a way that its position at time t is given by s(t) = 2 - sin t.
     Find v(/4) and a(/4). Compare these values and decide whether the particle is speeding up or slowing down.

     Solution
     First find v(t) = s (t):

                                                  v(t) = s (t) = -cost.

     Thus,

                                                        v  = - 1 .
                                                        4                         2

     Next, find a(t) = v(t). Thus, a(t) = v (t) = sin t and we have

                                                        a  = 1 .
                                                         4 2

     Since           -  1     <0  and        1    > 0,  we see that velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite
               v  =                    a  =
               4           2           42

     directions; that is, the object is being accelerated in the direction opposite to the direction in which it is travelling.

     Consequently, the particle is slowing down.

3.6 | The Chain Rule

                                 Learning Objectives

    3.6.1 State the chain rule for the composition of two functions.
    3.6.2 Apply the chain rule together with the power rule.
    3.6.3 Apply the chain rule and the product/quotient rules correctly in combination when both are
    necessary.
    3.6.4 Recognize the chain rule for a composition of three or more functions.
    3.6.5 Describe the proof of the chain rule.

We have seen the techniques for differentiating basic functions (xn, sin x, cos x, etc.) as well as sums, differences,
products, quotients, and constant multiples of these functions. However, these techniques do not allow us to differentiate

compositions of functions, such as  h(x)      =          3  or  k(x) =  3x2 + 1. In this section, we study the rule for finding the

                                                    sinx 

derivative of the composition of two or more functions.

Deriving the Chain Rule

When we have a function that is a composition of two or more functions, we could use all of the techniques we have already
learned to differentiate it. However, using all of those techniques to break down a function into simpler parts that we are
able to differentiate can get cumbersome. Instead, we use the chain rule, which states that the derivative of a composite
function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function times the derivative of the inner function.

To put this rule into context, let's take a look at an example:      h(x)  =       3     We can think of the derivative of this function

                                                                              sin x .

with respect to x as the rate of change of         3      relative to the change in  x.  Consequently, we want to know how       3

                                              sinx                                                                          sinx 

changes as x changes. We can think of this event as a chain reaction: As x changes, x3 changes, which leads to a change

in       3   This chain reaction gives us hints as to what is involved in computing the derivative of       3

    sin x .                                                                                            sinx . First of all, a

change in x forcing a change in x3 suggests that somehow the derivative of x3 is involved. In addition, the change in x3

forcing a change in              3  suggests that the derivative of  sin(u)   with respect to  u,  where u = x3,  is also part of the

                            sinx 

final derivative.

We can take a more formal look at the derivative of         h(x)  =       3   by setting up the limit that would give us the derivative

                                                                     sin x 

at a specific value      a  in the domain of  h(x)  =       3

                                                       sin x .

                                                                         3         3
                                                                     sin x  - sina 
                                                    h  (a)  =  lim         x-a           .

                                                               xa

This expression does not seem particularly helpful; however, we can modify it by multiplying and dividing by the
expression x3 - a3 to obtain

                                                                   3           3
                                                                sin x  - sina  x3 - a3
                                              h  (a)   =  lim        x3 - a3      · x-a .

                                                          xa

From the definition of the derivative, we can see that the second factor is the derivative of x3 at x = a. That is,

                                                 lim      x3 - a3 d  3                      2
                                                          x-a     = dxx x = a = 3a .
                                                 xa

However, it might be a little more challenging to recognize that the first term is also a derivative. We can see this by letting
u = x3 and observing that as x  a, u  a3 :

                                                                                                          =  cos     3

Thus,       h (a)    =           3  ·  3a    2.

In other words, if           h(x)      =  sin     3              then         h  (x)  =  cos    3   ·  3x 2.   Thus, if we think of      h(x)  =       3  as the composition

       g(                                                                                                                                      sinx 

derivative of g(x) = x3 and the derivative of the function f (x) = sin x evaluated at the function g(x) = x3. At this point,

we anticipate that for            h(x)       =   s  in           x        it is quite likely that h(x) = cos(g(x))g(x). As we determined above, this is the

                                                        g(          ),

case for          h(x)  =       3

Now that we have derived a special case of the chain rule, we state the general case and then apply it in a general form to
other composite functions. An informal proof is provided at the end of the section.

     Rule: The Chain Rule

     Let f and g be functions. For all x in the domain of g for which g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at
     g(x), the derivative of the composite function

                                                                                      h(x)  =   f  g(x)        =  f g(x)   

     is given by                                                                 h (x)      =  f        x  )g  (  x  ).                                   (3.17)
     Alternatively, if y is a function of u,
                                                                                                    g(

                                                                              and u is a function of x, then

                                                                                            dy = dy · du.

     Problem-Solving Strategy: Applying the Chain Rule

       1.         To differentiate        h(x)      =         f        x      begin by identifying f (x) and g(x).

                                                                 g(       ),

       2.         Find     f (x)  and evaluate it at                      g(x)   to obtain     f        x    

                                                                                                    g(     ).

       3. Find g(x).

       4.         Write    h (x)    =     f         x      ·  g     (  x  ).

                                               g(      )

     Note: When applying the chain rule to the composition of two or more functions, keep in mind that we work our way
     from the outside function in. It is also useful to remember that the derivative of the composition of two functions can
     be thought of as having two parts; the derivative of the composition of three functions has three parts; and so on. Also,
     remember that we never evaluate a derivative at a derivative.

The Chain and Power Rules Combined

We can now apply the chain rule to composite functions, but note that we often need to use it with other rules. For example,
to find derivatives of functions of the form h(x) = (g(x))n, we need to use the chain rule combined with the power rule. To

do so, we can think of                 n  as  f g(x)  where      f (x) = xn.      Then       f  (x) = nxn - 1.  Thus,        n - 1
                         h(x)  =  g(x)                                                                                 f  g(x) = ng(x) .

This leads us to the derivative of a power function using the chain rule,

                                                      h  (x)  =  ng(x)     n   -  1  g  (x)

Rule: Power Rule for Composition of Functions

For all values of x for which the derivative is defined, if

                                                              h(x)             n
                                                                    =    g(x) .

Then

                                                h  (x)   =  ng(x)     n  -  1  g  (x).                                       (3.18)

Example 3.48

  Using the Chain and Power Rules

Find the derivative of h(x) = 1 2.

                                           2 

                                   3x + 1

Solution

First, rewrite h(x) =               1          2 -2
                                        2 = 3x + 1 .
                         2 

                         3x + 1

Applying the power rule with g(x) = 3x2 + 1, we have

                                                                              2 -3

                                                h (x) = -23x + 1 (6x).

Rewriting back to the original form gives us
                                                     h (x) = -12x .
                                                               (3x2 + 1)3

     Solution
     First recall that sin3 x = (sin x)3, so we can rewrite h(x) = sin3 x as h(x) = (sin x)3.
     Applying the power rule with g(x) = sin x, we obtain

                                               h (x) = 3(sin x)2 cos x = 3 sin2 x cos x.

     Example 3.50

       Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line

     Find the equation of a line tangent to the graph of h(x) = 1 (3x - 5)2 at x = 2.

     Solution

     Because we are finding an equation of a line, we need a point. The x-coordinate of the point is 2. To find the
     y-coordinate, substitute 2 into h(x). Since h(2) =  1 2 = 1, the point is (2, 1).

                                                                3(2) - 5

     For the slope, we need h(2). To find h(x), first we rewrite h(x) = (3x - 5)-2 and apply the power rule to
     obtain

                                             h (x) = -2(3x - 5)-3 (3) = -6(3x - 5)-3.

     By substituting, we have  h   (2)   =   -63(2)     -   -3  =  -6.  Therefore, the line has equation  y - 1 = -6(x - 2).

                                                           5

     Rewriting, the equation of the line is y = -6x + 13.

           Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f (x) = x - 2 at x = -2.

Combining the Chain Rule with Other Rules

Now that we can combine the chain rule and the power rule, we examine how to combine the chain rule with the other rules
we have learned. In particular, we can use it with the formulas for the derivatives of trigonometric functions or with the
product rule.

   Example 3.51

     Using the Chain Rule on a General Cosine Function

     Find the derivative of  h(x)  =  c  os      x    

                                             g(     ).

Think of                 h(x) = cos(g(x))       as          f g(x)             where      f (x) = cos x.           Since        f  (x) = -sin x.  we have

f    g(x)  =  -sin           x      Then we do the following calculation.

                         g(     ).

                                    h (x)    =      f        x    )g  (  x  )       Apply the chain rule.

                                                         g(

                                             =    -s     in       x  )g     (x)     Substitute     f        x      =  -si    n      x    

                                                             g(                                         g(     )                g(     ).

Thus, the derivative of             h(x)  =  cos         x        is given by       h (x)  =  -si  n      x  )g    (  x  ).

                                                  g(        )                                         g(

In the following example we apply the rule that we have just derived.

   Example 3.52

Solution
Let g(x) = 5x2. Then g (x) = 10x. Using the result from the previous example,

                                                                  h (x)          =  -sin   2    ·  10x

Solution

Apply the chain rule to             h(x)  =  s  ec       x        to obtain

                                                    g(      )

                                                             h (x) = sec(g(x) tang(x)g (x).

In this problem, g(x) = 4x5 + 2x, so we have g (x) = 20x4 + 2. Therefore, we obtain

                                             h (x)                   5               5                   4

At this point we provide a list of derivative formulas that may be obtained by applying the chain rule in conjunction
with the formulas for derivatives of trigonometric functions. Their derivations are similar to those used in Example 3.51
and Example 3.53. For convenience, formulas are also given in Leibniz's notation, which some students find easier to
remember. (We discuss the chain rule using Leibniz's notation at the end of this section.) It is not absolutely necessary to
memorize these as separate formulas as they are all applications of the chain rule to previously learned formulas.

Composites of Three or More Functions

We can now combine the chain rule with other rules for differentiating functions, but when we are differentiating the
composition of three or more functions, we need to apply the chain rule more than once. If we look at this situation in
general terms, we can generate a formula, but we do not need to remember it, as we can simply apply the chain rule multiple
times.

In general terms, first we let

                                                                 k(x)      =       g(x).

Then, applying the chain rule once we obtain

                                                           d                                d

Applying the chain rule again, we obtain

For all values of x for which the function is differentiable, if

                                                                k(x)    =         g(x),  

                                                                             h f

then

                                                        k  (x)  =  h    f  g(x)     f    g(x)g  (x).
                                                                      

In other words, we are applying the chain rule twice.

Notice that the derivative of the composition of three functions has three parts. (Similarly, the derivative of the composition
of four functions has four parts, and so on.) Also, remember, we can always work from the outside in, taking one derivative
at a time.

     Differentiating a Composite of Three Functions

Find the derivative of          k(x)  =  cos  4      2  +    

                                                 7x        1.

Solution
First, rewrite k(x) as

                                                                        2 4

Then apply the chain rule several times.

                                                                                                      Apply the chain rule.

     Using the Chain Rule in a Velocity Problem

     A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time t is given by s(t) = sin (2t) + cos (3t). What is the
     velocity of the particle at time t =  ?

                                             6

     Solution
     To find v(t), the velocity of the particle at time t, we must differentiate s(t). Thus,

                                           v(t) = s (t) = 2cos(2t) - 3sin(3t).

     Substituting t =  into v(t),6 we obtain       6         -2.

     3.39 A particle moves along a coordinate axis. Its position at time t is given by s(t) = sin(4t). Find its
     acceleration at time t.

Proof

At this point, we present a very informal proof of the chain rule. For simplicity's sake we ignore certain issues: For example,
we assume that g(x)  g(a) for x  a in some open interval containing a. We begin by applying the limit definition of
the derivative to the function h(x) to obtain h(a):

                                                                  f g(x) - f g(a)            

                                              h  (a)    =  lim                    x-a          .

                                                           xa

Rewriting, we obtain                                    f g(x) - f g(a)                  g(x) - g(a)
Although it is clear that
                                      h  (a)  =  lim         g(x) - g(a)              ·      x-a      .

                                                 xa

                                                 lim    g(x) - g(a)               = g(a),
                                                             x-a
                                                 xa

it is not obvious that

                                                   f g(x) - f g(a)                

                                              lim                                   = f  g(a).    

                                              x  a g(x) - g(a)

To see that this is true, first recall that since g is differentiable at a, g is also continuous at a. Thus,

                                                            xlimag(x) = g(a).
Next, make the substitution y = g(x) and b = g(a) and use change of variables in the limit to obtain

                                   f g(x) - f g(a)                f (y) - f (b)

                           lim                          = lim                                = f  (b) = f  g(a).

                           x  a g(x) - g(a) y  b y - b

Finally,                                      f g(x) - f g(a)         g(x) - g(a)

                           h  (a)  =  lim                           · x - a = f  g(a)g (a).

The Chain Rule Using Leibniz's Notation

As with other derivatives that we have seen, we can express the chain rule using Leibniz's notation. This notation for the
chain rule is used heavily in physics applications.

For h(x)  =  f      x        let u = g(x) and y = h(x) = f (u). Thus,

                g(     ),

                                               h (x) =       dy,    f    g(x)   =  f  (u) =  dy and g (x) =    du.

                                                             dx                              du                dx

Consequently,

                                                          dy                                     dy du
                                                              = h (x) = f  g(x)g (x) = · .

     Finally, we put it all together.

     expressed entirely in terms of the original variable given in the problem.

3.7 | Derivatives of Inverse Functions

                             Learning Objectives

3.7.1 Calculate the derivative of an inverse function.
3.7.2 Recognize the derivatives of the standard inverse trigonometric functions.

In this section we explore the relationship between the derivative of a function and the derivative of its inverse. For functions
whose derivatives we already know, we can use this relationship to find derivatives of inverses without having to use the
limit definition of the derivative. In particular, we will apply the formula for derivatives of inverse functions to trigonometric
functions. This formula may also be used to extend the power rule to rational exponents.

The Derivative of an Inverse Function

We begin by considering a function and its inverse. If f (x) is both invertible and differentiable, it seems reasonable that

the inverse of f (x) is also differentiable. Figure 3.28 shows the relationship between a function f (x) and its inverse

f -1 (x).  Look at the point      f  -1 (a)     on  the    graph    of     f -1(x)         having a tangent line with a slope of     f  -1     (a)   =  p   This
                                                                                                                                                        q.
                              a,                                                                                                          

point corresponds to a point      f  -1  (a),       on  the   graph        of     f (x)       having a tangent line with a slope of           -1  q
                                                                                                                                           f   f (a) = p.
                                                a

Thus, if f -1(x) is differentiable at a, then it must be the case that

We may also derive the formula for the derivative of the inverse by first recalling that                     x  =                 f     f  -1        Then by

differentiating both sides of this equation (using the chain rule on the right), we obtain

     Example 3.60

       Applying the Inverse Function Theorem

     Use the inverse function theorem to find the derivative of                  g(x)  =  x + 2.    Compare the resulting derivative to that
                                                                                            x

     obtained by differentiating the function directly.

     Solution

     The inverse of      g(x) =      x+2     is  f (x) = 2 . Since g (x) = 1 ,                          begin by finding  f  (x). Thus,
                                       x               x-1                             f  g(x)

                                   f  (x) =      -2    and  f        x      =     -2      =         -2           = - x2.
                                             (x - 1)2                                  2                      2  2
                                                                 g(     )      g(x) - 1        x + 2

                                                                                                x - 1

     Finally,

                                                        g (x) = 1  = - 2 .
                                                                            f  g(x)       x2

     We can verify that this is the correct derivative by applying the quotient rule to g(x) to obtain

                                                                 g (x) = - 2x2.

         3.42 Use the inverse function theorem to find the derivative of g(x) = 1 . Compare the result obtained
                                                                                                 x+2

         by differentiating g(x) directly.

  Solution                                                  f (x) = x3. Since g (x) = 1 ,                    begin by finding

From the previous example, we see that we can use the inverse function theorem to extend the power rule to exponents of

the form  1,  where n is a positive integer. This extension will ultimately allow us to differentiate xq,    where q is any
          n

rational number.

  Theorem 3.12: Extending the Power Rule to Rational Exponents

  The power rule may be extended to rational exponents. That is, if n is a positive integer, then

                                      dx  x  = n x                      .                                    (3.21)

  Also, if n is a positive integer and m is an arbitrary integer, then

                                      d  m/n m (m/n) - 1                   .
                                      dx  x  = n x

Proof

The function g(x) = x1/n is the inverse of the function f (x) = xn. Since g (x) = 1 ,                        begin by finding f  (x).
                                                                                                    f  g(x)

Thus,

                                 n-1                        1/n n - 1               (n - 1)/n

Finally,

                             g (x) =      1    1 (1 - n)/n 1 (1/n) - 1
                                          (n - 1)/n = n x                     = nx  .

Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

We now turn our attention to finding derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions. These derivatives will prove invaluable
in the study of integration later in this text. The derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions are quite surprising in that
their derivatives are actually algebraic functions. Previously, derivatives of algebraic functions have proven to be algebraic
functions and derivatives of trigonometric functions have been shown to be trigonometric functions. Here, for the first time,
we see that the derivative of a function need not be of the same type as the original function.

   Example 3.63

     Derivative of the Inverse Sine Function

     Use the inverse function theorem to find the derivative of g(x) = sin-1 x.

     Solution

     Since for  x  in the interval  -  ,     ,  f (x) = sin x    is the inverse of        g(x) = sin-1 x,  begin by finding  f (x).

                                              
                                    22

     Since

                                    f  (x)  =  cos x  and   f        x      =  cos sin-1     =  1 - x2,

                                                                 g(     )                 x

     we see that

                                          g (x) =     d sin-1 x =                 1  =        1.

Analysis

To see that  cos              -1     =  1 - x2,         consider the following argument. Set sin-1 x = . In this case, sin  = x

                         sin      x

where -      . We begin by considering the case where 0 <  <  . Since  is an acute angle, we may22   2

construct a right triangle having acute angle , a hypotenuse of length 1 and the side opposite angle  having

length x. From the Pythagorean theorem, the side adjacent to angle  has length 1 - x2. This triangle is

shown in Figure          3.29. Using the triangle, we see that                  cos       -1     =  cos    =  1 - x2.

                                                                                     sin      x

                                     length x,      we can see that       cos        -1     =  cos   =     1 - x2.

                                                                                sin      x

In the case where -  <  < 0, we make the observation that 0 < - <  and hence2                           2

                                              cos sin-1                =  cos   =  cos (-)     =    1 - x2.

Now if  =  or  = -  , x = 1 or x = -1, and since in either case cos  = 0 and22                                         1 - x2 = 0,        we have

                                                        cos sin-1            =  cos   =     1 - x2.

Finally, if  = - , x = 0 and cos  = -1 = 1 .

Consequently, in all cases,             cos       -1        =   1 - x2.

     Now let g(x) = 2x3, so g (x) = 6x2. Substituting into the previous result, we obtain

                                                       h (x) = 1 · 6x2

Solution
Begin by differentiating s(t) in order to find v(t). Thus,

                                           v(t) = s (t) =         1 · -1.

Simplifying, we have

3.8 | Implicit Differentiation

                             Learning Objectives

3.8.1 Find the derivative of a complicated function by using implicit differentiation.
3.8.2 Use implicit differentiation to determine the equation of a tangent line.

We have already studied how to find equations of tangent lines to functions and the rate of change of a function at a specific
point. In all these cases we had the explicit equation for the function and differentiated these functions explicitly. Suppose
instead that we want to determine the equation of a tangent line to an arbitrary curve or the rate of change of an arbitrary
curve at a point. In this section, we solve these problems by finding the derivatives of functions that define y implicitly in

terms of x.

Implicit Differentiation

In most discussions of math, if the dependent variable y is a function of the independent variable x, we express y in terms

of x. If this is the case, we say that y is an explicit function of x. For example, when we write the equation y = x2 + 1,
we are defining y explicitly in terms of x. On the other hand, if the relationship between the function y and the variable x
is expressed by an equation where y is not expressed entirely in terms of x, we say that the equation defines y implicitly

in terms of x. For example, the equation y - x2 = 1 defines the function y = x2 + 1 implicitly.

Implicit differentiation allows us to find slopes of tangents to curves that are clearly not functions (they fail the vertical line
test). We are using the idea that portions of y are functions that satisfy the given equation, but that y is not actually a
function of x.

In general, an equation defines a function implicitly if the function satisfies that equation. An equation may define many
different functions implicitly. For example, the functions

y = 25 - x and y = 2      25 - x2 if - 5 < x < 0  , which are illustrated in Figure 3.30, are just three of the many

                         - 25 - x2 if 0 < x < 25

functions defined implicitly by the equation x2 + y2 = 25.
310  Chapter 3 | Derivatives

       Figure 3.30 The equation x2 + y2 = 25 defines many functions implicitly.

If we want to find the slope of the line tangent to the graph of x2 + y2 = 25 at the point (3, 4), we could evaluate
the derivative of the function y = 25 - x2 at x = 3. On the other hand, if we want the slope of the tangent line at the
point (3, -4), we could use the derivative of y = - 25 - x2. However, it is not always easy to solve for a function
defined implicitly by an equation. Fortunately, the technique of implicit differentiation allows us to find the derivative of
an implicitly defined function without ever solving for the function explicitly. The process of finding dy using implicit

                                                                                                                        dx
differentiation is described in the following problem-solving strategy.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Implicit Differentiation

To perform implicit differentiation on an equation that defines a function y implicitly in terms of a variable x, use
the following steps:

1. Take the derivative of both sides of the equation. Keep in mind that y is a function of x. Consequently, whereas

d (sin x) = cos x, d (sin y) = cos ydy because we must use the chain rule to differentiate sin y with respect
dx                             dx            dx

to x.

2. Rewrite the equation so that all terms containing dy are on the left and all terms that do not contain dy are
                                                   dx                                               dx

on the right.

3. Factor out dy on the left.
                  dx

4. Solve for dy by dividing both sides of the equation by an appropriate algebraic expression.
                dx

  Using Implicit Differentiation

Assuming that y is defined implicitly by the equation x2 + y2 = 25, find dydx.

Solution
Follow the steps in the problem-solving strategy.

                         d x2 + y2 =   d (25)    Step 1. Differentiate both sides of the equation.
                         dx            dx

                         d x2 + d y2 = 0         Step 1.1. Use the sum rule on the left.
                         dx  dx 
                                                 On the right d (25) = 0.
                                                                dx

                                                 Step 1.2. Take the derivatives, so  d x2 = 2x

                                                                                        
                         2x + 2ydydx = 0                                             dx

                                                   d  2  dy
                                                 and y  = 2y .
                                                   dx    dx

                               2ydydx = -2x      Step 2. Keep the terms with dydx on the left.

                                                 Move the remaining terms to the right.

                                   dy = -xy      Step 4. Divide both sides of the equation by

                                   dx            2y. (Step 3 does not apply in this case.)

Analysis

Note that the resulting expression for dydx is in terms of both the independent variable x and the dependent
variable y. Although in some cases it may be possible to express dydx in terms of x only, it is generally not
possible to do so.

Finding Tangent Lines Implicitly

Now that we have seen the technique of implicit differentiation, we can apply it to the problem of finding equations of
tangent lines to curves described by equations.

     Finding a Tangent Line to a Circle

Find the equation of the line tangent to the curve x2 + y2 = 25 at the point (3, -4).

Solution

Although we could find this equation without using implicit differentiation, using that method makes it much

easier. In Example 3.68, we found = - y.

  Applying Implicit Differentiation

In a simple video game, a rocket travels in an elliptical orbit whose path is described by the equation

4x2 + 25y2 = 100. The rocket can fire missiles along lines tangent to its path. The object of the game is to

destroy an incoming asteroid traveling along the positive x-axis toward (0, 0). If the rocket fires a missile when

it is located at             58, where will it intersect the x-axis?

                         3,   

Solution
To solve this problem, we must determine where the line tangent to the graph of

3.9 | Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic
Functions

                             Learning Objectives

3.9.1 Find the derivative of exponential functions.
3.9.2 Find the derivative of logarithmic functions.
3.9.3 Use logarithmic differentiation to determine the derivative of a function.

So far, we have learned how to differentiate a variety of functions, including trigonometric, inverse, and implicit functions.
In this section, we explore derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions. As we discussed in Introduction to
Functions and Graphs, exponential functions play an important role in modeling population growth and the decay
of radioactive materials. Logarithmic functions can help rescale large quantities and are particularly helpful for rewriting
complicated expressions.

Derivative of the Exponential Function

Just as when we found the derivatives of other functions, we can find the derivatives of exponential and logarithmic
functions using formulas. As we develop these formulas, we need to make certain basic assumptions. The proofs that these
assumptions hold are beyond the scope of this course.

First of all, we begin with the assumption that the function B(x) = bx, b > 0, is defined for every real number and is

continuous. In previous courses, the values of exponential functions for all rational numbers were defined--beginning

with the definition of bn, where n is a positive integer--as the product of b multiplied by itself n times. Later,

we defined b0 = 1, b-n = 1n, for a positive integer n, and bs/t = (t b)s for positive integers s and t. These
                                 b

definitions leave open the question of the value of br where r is an arbitrary real number. By assuming the continuity of

B(x) = bx, b > 0,        we may interpret  br  as  lim bx  where the values of  x  as we take the limit are rational. For example,

                                                   xr

we may view 4 as the number satisfying

                         43 < 4 < 44, 43.1 < 4 < 43.2, 43.14 < 4 < 43.15,
                         43.141 < 4 < 43.142, 43.1415 < 4 < 43.1416 ,....

     Table 3.6 Approximating a Value of 4

We also assume that for B(x) = bx, b > 0, the value B (0) of the derivative exists. In this section, we show that by
making this one additional assumption, it is possible to prove that the function B(x) is differentiable everywhere.

We make one final assumption: that there is a unique value of b > 0 for which B (0) = 1. We define e to be this
unique value, as we did in Introduction to Functions and Graphs. Figure 3.33 provides graphs of the functions
y = 2x, y = 3x, y = 2.7x, and y = 2.8x. A visual estimate of the slopes of the tangent lines to these functions at 0
provides evidence that the value of e lies somewhere between 2.7 and 2.8. The function E(x) = ex is called the natural
exponential function. Its inverse, L(x) = loge x = ln x is called the natural logarithmic function.

Figure 3.33 The graph of E(x) = ex is between y = 2x and y = 3x.

For a better estimate of e, we may construct a table of estimates of B (0) for functions of the form B(x) = bx. Before
doing this, recall that

                          B (0) = lim  bx - b0  bx - 1 bx - 1
                                                = lim x  x
                          x0 x-0 x0

for values of x very close to zero. For our estimates, we choose x = 0.00001 and x = -0.00001 to obtain the estimate

                          b-0.00001 - 1 < B (0) < b0.00001 - 1.

The evidence from the table suggests that 2.7182 < e < 2.7183.
The graph of E(x) = ex together with the line y = x + 1 are shown in Figure 3.34. This line is tangent to the graph of
E(x) = ex at x = 0.

Now that we have laid out our basic assumptions, we begin our investigation by exploring the derivative of
B(x) = bx, b > 0. Recall that we have assumed that B (0) exists. By applying the limit definition to the derivative we

conclude that

                      B (0) = lim b0 + h - b0 = lim bh - 1.                                                             (3.28)

                                = bx B (0)

We see that on the basis of the assumption that B(x) = bx is differentiable at 0, B(x) is not only differentiable everywhere,
but its derivative is

                                          B (x) = bx B (0).                                       (3.29)

For E(x) = ex, E (0) = 1. Thus, we have E (x) = ex. (The value of B (0) for an arbitrary function of the form
B(x) = bx, b > 0, will be derived later.)

Let E(x) = ex be the natural exponential function. Then

       Applying the Natural Exponential Function

       A colony of mosquitoes has an initial population of 1000. After t days, the population is given by
        A(t) = 1000e0.3t. Show that the ratio of the rate of change of the population, A (t), to the population, A(t) is
       constant.

       Solution
       First find A (t). By using the chain rule, we have A (t) = 300e0.3t. Thus, the ratio of the rate of change of the
       population to the population is given by

                                                         A (t) = 300e 1000e0.3t 0.3t = 0.3.
       The ratio of the rate of change of the population to the population is the constant 0.3.

     3.51 If A(t) = 1000e0.3t describes the mosquito population after t days, as in the preceding example, what
     is the rate of change of A(t) after 4 days?

Derivative of the Logarithmic Function

Now that we have the derivative of the natural exponential function, we can use implicit differentiation to find the derivative
of its inverse, the natural logarithmic function.

                                                            g(x)

Proof
If x > 0 and y = ln x, then ey = x. Differentiating both sides of this equation results in the equation

                                                                     ey dydx = 1.

Solving for dy yields
              dx

                                                                        dy 1

                                                                        dx e

Finally, we substitute x = ey to obtain

                                                                  dy = 1.

We may also derive this result by applying the inverse function theorem, as follows. Since y = g(x) = ln x is the inverse
of f (x) = ex, by applying the inverse function theorem we have

                                                  dy = 1 = 1 = 1.                             x

Using this result and applying the chain rule to  h(x)  =            l  n      x      yields

Proof

If y = logb x, then by = x. It follows that ln (by) = ln x. Thus y ln b = ln x. Solving for y,     we have y = ln x.
Differentiating and keeping in mind that ln b is a constant, we see that                                            ln b

                                                               dy = 1 .

The derivative in Equation 3.33 now follows from the chain rule.

If y = bx, then ln y = x ln b. Using implicit differentiation, again keeping in mind that ln b is constant, it follows that

1 dy                     dy                x
y = ln b. Solving for and substituting y = b , we see that
  dx                     dx

                                                          dydx = y ln b = bx ln b.
The more general derivative (Equation 3.35) follows from the chain rule.

At this point, we can take derivatives of functions of the form                   y = g(x)n  for certain values of  n,  as well as functions

of the form y = bg(x), where b > 0 and b  1. Unfortunately, we still do not know the derivatives of functions such as
y = xx or y = x. These functions require a technique called logarithmic differentiation, which allows us to differentiate

any function of the form h(x) = g(x) f (x). It can also be used to convert a very complex differentiation problem into a

simpler one, such as finding the derivative of y = xex2x + sin3 1x . We outline this technique in the following problem-solving
strategy.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Using Logarithmic Differentiation

     1. To differentiate y = h(x) using logarithmic differentiation, take the natural logarithm of both sides of the

         equation to obtain  ln y  =  ln      x    

                                          h(     ).

     2.  Use properties of logarithms to expand      ln      x      as much as possible.

                                                         h(     )

                                                                                     1 dy
     3. Differentiate both sides of the equation. On the left we will have y .

                                                                                        dx

     4. Multiply both sides of the equation by y to solve for dydx.
     5. Replace y by h(x).

KEY CONCEPTS

3.1 Defining the Derivative

· The slope of the tangent line to a curve measures the instantaneous rate of change of a curve. We can calculate it by
   finding the limit of the difference quotient or the difference quotient with increment h.

· The derivative of a function f (x) at a value a is found using either of the definitions for the slope of the tangent
   line.

· Velocity is the rate of change of position. As such, the velocity v(t) at time t is the derivative of the position s(t)
   at time t. Average velocity is given by

                                                                   s(t) - s(a)
                                                          vave = t - a .

Instantaneous velocity is given by

                                    v(a) = s (a) = lim         s(t) - s(a)  .
                                                               t-a
                                                           ta

· We may estimate a derivative by using a table of values.

3.2 The Derivative as a Function

     · The derivative of a function f (x) is the function whose value at x is f (x).

     · The graph of a derivative of a function f (x) is related to the graph of f (x). Where f (x) has a tangent line with
         positive slope, f  (x) > 0. Where f (x) has a tangent line with negative slope, f  (x) < 0. Where f (x) has a
         horizontal tangent line, f  (x) = 0.

     · If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point. A function is not differentiable at a point
         if it is not continuous at the point, if it has a vertical tangent line at the point, or if the graph has a sharp corner or
         cusp.

     · Higher-order derivatives are derivatives of derivatives, from the second derivative to the nth derivative.

3.3 Differentiation Rules

     · The derivative of a constant function is zero.

     · The derivative of a power function is a function in which the power on x becomes the coefficient of the term and
         the power on x in the derivative decreases by 1.

     · The derivative of a constant c multiplied by a function f is the same as the constant multiplied by the derivative.

     · The derivative of the sum of a function f and a function g is the same as the sum of the derivative of f and the
         derivative of g.

     · The derivative of the difference of a function f and a function g is the same as the difference of the derivative of f
         and the derivative of g.

     · The derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the
         derivative of the second function times the first function.

     · The derivative of the quotient of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function minus
338                                                                                                                         Chapter 3 | Derivatives

        the derivative of the second function times the first function, all divided by the square of the second function.

     · We used the limit definition of the derivative to develop formulas that allow us to find derivatives without resorting
        to the definition of the derivative. These formulas can be used singly or in combination with each other.

3.4 Derivatives as Rates of Change

     · Using f (a + h)  f (a) + f  (a)h, it is possible to estimate f (a + h) given f  (a) and f (a).

     · The rate of change of position is velocity, and the rate of change of velocity is acceleration. Speed is the absolute
         value, or magnitude, of velocity.

     · The population growth rate and the present population can be used to predict the size of a future population.
     · Marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal profit functions can be used to predict, respectively, the cost of

         producing one more item, the revenue obtained by selling one more item, and the profit obtained by producing and
         selling one more item.

3.5 Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions

     · We can find the derivatives of sin x and cos x by using the definition of derivative and the limit formulas found
        earlier. The results are

                                                       d sin x = cos x d cos x = -sin x.
                                                    dx                             dx

     · With these two formulas, we can determine the derivatives of all six basic trigonometric functions.

3.6 The Chain Rule

     ·  The chain rule allows us to differentiate compositions of two or more functions. It states that for                 h(x)  =  f      x    

                                                                                                                                        g(     ),

                                                              h (x)        =    f          x  )g  (  x  ).

                                                                                       g(

        In Leibniz's notation this rule takes the form

                                                                  dy = dy · du.
                                                                  dx du dx
     · We can use the chain rule with other rules that we have learned, and we can derive formulas for some of them.

     · The chain rule combines with the power rule to form a new rule:

                                              h(x)               n                 h (x)         ng(x)      n  -  1 g (x).
                                        If          =     g(x) ,       then                   =

     · When applied to the composition of three functions, the chain rule can be expressed as follows: If

        h(x)               then               (gk         )g             
              =  f gk(x),        h (x)  =  f        (  x         (  x        (  x  ).
                                                              k        )k

3.7 Derivatives of Inverse Functions

     · The inverse function theorem allows us to compute derivatives of inverse functions without using the limit
         definition of the derivative.

Introduction

A rocket is being launched from the ground and cameras are recording the event. A video camera is located on the ground
a certain distance from the launch pad. At what rate should the angle of inclination (the angle the camera makes with the
342                                Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

ground) change to allow the camera to record the flight of the rocket as it heads upward? (See Example 4.3.)

A rocket launch involves two related quantities that change over time. Being able to solve this type of problem is just
one application of derivatives introduced in this chapter. We also look at how derivatives are used to find maximum and
minimum values of functions. As a result, we will be able to solve applied optimization problems, such as maximizing
revenue and minimizing surface area. In addition, we examine how derivatives are used to evaluate complicated limits, to
approximate roots of functions, and to provide accurate graphs of functions.

4.1 | Related Rates

                                  Learning Objectives

     4.1.1 Express changing quantities in terms of derivatives.
     4.1.2 Find relationships among the derivatives in a given problem.
     4.1.3 Use the chain rule to find the rate of change of one quantity that depends on the rate of
     change of other quantities.

We have seen that for quantities that are changing over time, the rates at which these quantities change are given by
derivatives. If two related quantities are changing over time, the rates at which the quantities change are related. For
example, if a balloon is being filled with air, both the radius of the balloon and the volume of the balloon are increasing.
In this section, we consider several problems in which two or more related quantities are changing and we study how to
determine the relationship between the rates of change of these quantities.

Setting up Related-Rates Problems

In many real-world applications, related quantities are changing with respect to time. For example, if we consider the
balloon example again, we can say that the rate of change in the volume, V, is related to the rate of change in the radius,

r. In this case, we say that dV and dr are related rates because V is related to r. Here we study several examples of
                  dt      dt

related quantities that are changing with respect to time and we look at how to calculate one rate of change given another

rate of change.

     Example 4.1

     Inflating a Balloon

     A spherical balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm3 /sec (Figure 4.2). How fast is the radius
     increasing when the radius is 3 cm ?

      Figure 4.2 As the balloon is being filled with air, both the radius and the volume are increasing with respect to time.
     Solution

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives                                                                                343

The volume of a sphere of radius r centimeters is

                                                       V = 4r3 cm3.
                                                             3

Since the balloon is being filled with air, both the volume and the radius are functions of time. Therefore, t
seconds after beginning to fill the balloon with air, the volume of air in the balloon is

                                                   V(t) = 4[r(t)]3 cm3.
                                                            3

Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time and applying the chain rule, we see that the rate of
change in the volume is related to the rate of change in the radius by the equation

                                               V (t)    =      2  r   (t).

                                                           4r(t)

The balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm3/sec, so V(t) = 2 cm3 /sec. Therefore,

                                         2cm3  /sec  =    2        2  ·  r(t)cm/s,

                                                        4r(t)  cm 

which implies                                  r(t) = 2r(t) 1 2 cm/sec.
When the radius r = 3 cm,

                                               r(t) = 1 cm/sec.

4.1 What is the instantaneous rate of change of the radius when r = 6 cm ?

Before looking at other examples, let's outline the problem-solving strategy we will be using to solve related-rates problems.

  Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving a Related-Rates Problem
       1. Assign symbols to all variables involved in the problem. Draw a figure if applicable.
       2. State, in terms of the variables, the information that is given and the rate to be determined.
       3. Find an equation relating the variables introduced in step 1.
       4. Using the chain rule, differentiate both sides of the equation found in step 3 with respect to the independent
            variable. This new equation will relate the derivatives.
       5. Substitute all known values into the equation from step 4, then solve for the unknown rate of change.

Note that when solving a related-rates problem, it is crucial not to substitute known values too soon. For example, if the
value for a changing quantity is substituted into an equation before both sides of the equation are differentiated, then that
quantity will behave as a constant and its derivative will not appear in the new equation found in step 4. We examine this
potential error in the following example.

Examples of the Process

Let's now implement the strategy just described to solve several related-rates problems. The first example involves a plane
flying overhead. The relationship we are studying is between the speed of the plane and the rate at which the distance
between the plane and a person on the ground is changing.
344                                                                                          Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     Example 4.2

       An Airplane Flying at a Constant Elevation

       An airplane is flying overhead at a constant elevation of 4000 ft. A man is viewing the plane from a position
       3000 ft from the base of a radio tower. The airplane is flying horizontally away from the man. If the plane is
       flying at the rate of 600 ft/sec, at what rate is the distance between the man and the plane increasing when the
       plane passes over the radio tower?

       Solution
       Step 1. Draw a picture, introducing variables to represent the different quantities involved.

     Figure 4.3 An airplane is flying at a constant height of 4000 ft. The distance between the
     person and the airplane and the person and the place on the ground directly below the airplane
     are changing. We denote those quantities with the variables s and x, respectively.

     As shown, x denotes the distance between the man and the position on the ground directly below the airplane.
     The variable s denotes the distance between the man and the plane. Note that both x and s are functions of
     time. We do not introduce a variable for the height of the plane because it remains at a constant elevation of

     4000 ft. Since an object's height above the ground is measured as the shortest distance between the object and
     the ground, the line segment of length 4000 ft is perpendicular to the line segment of length x feet, creating a
     right triangle.

     Step 2. Since x denotes the horizontal distance between the man and the point on the ground below the plane,

     dx/dt represents the speed of the plane. We are told the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec. Therefore, dx = 600
                                                                                                                           dt

     ft/sec. Since we are asked to find the rate of change in the distance between the man and the plane when the plane
     is directly above the radio tower, we need to find ds/dt when x = 3000 ft.

     Step 3. From the figure, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation relating x and s:

     x(t)2  +  40002                                                              =   2

                                                                                     s(t) .

     Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time and using the fact that the derivative of a constant is
     zero, we arrive at the equation

                                                  xdx = sds.
                                                   dt dt

Step 5. Find the rate at which the distance between the man and the plane is increasing when the plane is directly

over the radio tower. That is, find ds when x = 3000 ft. Since the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec, we know
                                        dt

that dx = 600 ft/sec. We are not given an explicit value for s; however, since we are trying to find ds when
dt                                                                       dt

x = 3000 ft, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the distance s when x = 3000 and the height

is 4000 ft. Solving the equation

                                                    30002 + 40002 = s2

for s, we have s = 5000 ft at the time of interest. Using these values, we conclude that ds/dt is a solution of
the equation

                                         (3000)(600) = (5000) · ds.
                                                                     dt

Therefore,

                                               ds = 3000 · 600 = 360 ft/sec.
                                               dt 5000

Note: When solving related-rates problems, it is important not to substitute values for the variables too soon. For
example, in step 3, we related the variable quantities x(t) and s(t) by the equation

                                         x(t)2    +  40002  =   2

                                                               s(t) .

Since the plane remains at a constant height, it is not necessary to introduce a variable for the height, and we are
allowed to use the constant 4000 to denote that quantity. However, the other two quantities are changing. If we
mistakenly substituted x(t) = 3000 into the equation before differentiating, our equation would have been

                                         30002    +  40002  =   2

                                                               s(t) .

After differentiating, our equation would become

                                                  0 = s(t)ds.
                                                           dt

As a result, we would incorrectly conclude that ds = 0.
                                                        dt

        4.2 What is the speed of the plane if the distance between the person and the plane is increasing at the rate of
         300 ft/sec?

We now return to the problem involving the rocket launch from the beginning of the chapter.

   Example 4.3

                                     Figure 4.4 (credit: modification of work by Steve Jurvetson,

     A rocket is launched so that it rises vertically. A camera is positioned 5000 ft from the launch pad. When the
     rocket is 1000 ft above the launch pad, its velocity is 600 ft/sec. Find the necessary rate of change of the
     camera's angle as a function of time so that it stays focused on the rocket.

Step 2. We are trying to find the rate of change in the angle of the camera with respect to time when the rocket is

rocket is dh = 600 ft/sec.

           dt

Step 3. Now we need to find an equation relating the two quantities that are changing with respect to time: h and
. How can we create such an equation? Using the fact that we have drawn a right triangle, it is natural to think
about trigonometric functions. Recall that tan is the ratio of the length of the opposite side of the triangle to the
length of the adjacent side. Thus, we have

                                                     tan = h .
                                                              5000

This gives us the equation

                                                        h = 5000tan.
Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time t, we obtain

                                                 dh = 5000 sec2  d.
                                                 dt                 dt

Step 5. We want to find d when h = 1000 ft. At this time, we know that dh = 600 ft/sec. We need to
                                         dt                                   dt

determine sec2 . Recall that sec  is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the adjacent

side. We know the length of the adjacent side is 5000 ft. To determine the length of the hypotenuse, we use the

Pythagorean theorem, where the length of one leg is 5000 ft, the length of the other leg is h = 1000 ft, and

the length of the hypotenuse is c feet as shown in the following figure.

We see that

                                                 10002 + 50002 = c2

and we conclude that the hypotenuse is

                                                     c = 1000 26 ft.

Therefore, when h = 1000, we have

                                                 sec2  = 1000 26 = 2 26.
                                                            5000  25

Recall from step 4 that the equation relating d to our known values is
                                                    dt

                                                 dh = 5000 sec2  d.
                                                 dt                 dt

When h = 1000 ft, we know that dh = 600 ft/sec and sec2  = 26. Substituting these values into the
                                             dt                           25

     previous equation, we arrive at the equation  600 = 500026d.
     Therefore, d = 3 rad/sec.                                   25 dt

        4.3 What rate of change is necessary for the elevation angle of the camera if the camera is placed on the
        ground at a distance of 4000 ft from the launch pad and the velocity of the rocket is 500 ft/sec when the rocket
        is 2000 ft off the ground?

In the next example, we consider water draining from a cone-shaped funnel. We compare the rate at which the level of water
in the cone is decreasing with the rate at which the volume of water is decreasing.

   Example 4.4

     Water Draining from a Funnel

     Water is draining from the bottom of a cone-shaped funnel at the rate of 0.03 ft3 /sec. The height of the funnel
     is 2 ft and the radius at the top of the funnel is 1 ft. At what rate is the height of the water in the funnel changing
     when the height of the water is 1 ft ?

                                           2

     Solution
      Step 1: Draw a picture introducing the variables.

                                       Figure 4.6 Water is draining from a funnel of height 2 ft and
                                       radius 1 ft. The height of the water and the radius of water are
                                       changing over time. We denote these quantities with the
                                   variables h and r, respectively.

Let h denote the height of the water in the funnel, r denote the radius of the water at its surface, and V denote
the volume of the water.

Step 2: We need to determine dh when h = 1 ft. We know that dV = -0.03 ft/sec.2
                                         dt                                 dt

Step 3: The volume of water in the cone is

                                                          V = 1r2 h.
                                                                3

From the figure, we see that we have similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of the sides in the two triangles is the

same. Therefore, r = 1 or r = h. Using this fact, the equation for volume can be simplified to2
                 h2

                                                    V = 1h2 h =  h3.

Step 4: Applying the chain rule while differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time t,  we obtain

                                                          dV =  h2 dh.
                                                          dt 4 dt

Step 5: We want to find dh when h = 1 ft. Since water is leaving at the rate of 0.03 ft3 /sec,2         we know that
                     dt

dV = -0.03 ft3 /sec. Therefore,

                                                               12 dh
                                                    -0.03 =   ,

                                                               4 2 dt

which implies

                                                          -0.03 =  dh.
                                                                     16 dt

It follows that

                                                dh  =  - 0.48  = -0.153 ft/sec.

We have just seen how derivatives allow us to compare related quantities that are changing over time. In this section, we
examine another application of derivatives: the ability to approximate functions locally by linear functions. Linear functions
are the easiest functions with which to work, so they provide a useful tool for approximating function values. In addition,
the ideas presented in this section are generalized later in the text when we study how to approximate functions by higher-
degree polynomials Introduction to Power Series and Functions (http://cnx.org/content/m53760/latest/) .

Linear Approximation of a Function at a Point

Consider a function f that is differentiable at a point x = a. Recall that the tangent line to the graph of f at a is given
by the equation

                                              y = f (a) + f (a)(x - a).

For example, consider the function f (x) = 1x at a = 2. Since f is differentiable at x = 2 and f (x) = - 1x2,         we see
that f (2) = - 1. Therefore, the tangent line to the graph of f at a = 2 is given by the equation

                   4

                                              y = 1 - 1(x - 2).
                                                   24

Figure 4.7(a) shows a graph of  f  (x)  =  1  along with the tangent line to         f  at  x = 2.  Note that for  x  near 2, the graph of
                                           x

the tangent line is close to the graph of f . As a result, we can use the equation of the tangent line to approximate f (x) for

x near 2. For example, if x = 2.1, the y value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is

                                              y = 1 - 1(2.1 - 2) = 0.475.
                                                   24

The actual value of f (2.1) is given by

                                                        f (2.1) = 1  0.47619.
                                                                   2.1

Therefore, the tangent line gives us a fairly good approximation of f (2.1) (Figure 4.7(b)). However, note that for values
of x far from 2, the equation of the tangent line does not give us a good approximation. For example, if x = 10, the y
-value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is

                                           y = 1 - 1(10 - 2) = 1 - 2 = -1.5,
                                              24                                  2

whereas the value of the function at x = 10 is f (10) = 0.1.

Figure 4.7 (a) The tangent line to f (x) = 1/x at x = 2 provides a good approximation to f for x near 2.
(b) At x = 2.1, the value of y on the tangent line to f (x) = 1/x is 0.475. The actual value of f (2.1) is
1/2.1, which is approximately 0.47619.

In general, for a differentiable function f , the equation of the tangent line to f at x = a can be used to approximate
 f (x) for x near a. Therefore, we can write

                                         f (x)  f (a) + f (a)(x - a) for x near a.

We call the linear function

                                         L(x) = f (a) + f (a)(x - a)                                        (4.1)

the linear approximation, or tangent line approximation, of f at x = a. This function L is also known as the
linearization of f at x = a.

To show how useful the linear approximation can be, we look at how to find the linear approximation for f (x) = x at
x = 9.

Example 4.5

Linear Approximation of x

Find the linear approximation of f (x) = x at x = 9 and use the approximation to estimate 9.1.

Solution                                              x = 9,          using Equation 4.1 we know the linear
Since we are looking for the linear approximation at

                                         L(x) = f (9) + f (9)(x - 9).

We need to find f (9) and f (9).
356                                                                                     Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

                                     f (x) = x  f (9) = 9 = 3

     f (x) = 1  f (9) = 1 = 1
                                     2x                                           29 6

     Therefore, the linear approximation is given by Figure 4.8.

                                     L(x) = 3 + 1(x - 9)
                                                   6

     Using the linear approximation, we can estimate 9.1 by writing

     9.1 = f (9.1)  L(9.1) = 3 + 1(9.1 - 9)  3.0167.
                                        6

                                   x = 9 provides an approximation to f for x near 9.

     Analysis
     Using a calculator, the value of 9.1 to four decimal places is 3.0166. The value given by the linear
     approximation, 3.0167, is very close to the value obtained with a calculator, so it appears that using this linear
     approximation is a good way to estimate x, at least for x near 9. At the same time, it may seem odd to use
     a linear approximation when we can just push a few buttons on a calculator to evaluate 9.1. However, how
     does the calculator evaluate 9.1 ? The calculator uses an approximation! In fact, calculators and computers use
     approximations all the time to evaluate mathematical expressions; they just use higher-degree approximations.

We see that

                                         f (x) = sin x                  3

Therefore, the linear approximation of f at x = /3 is given by Figure 4.9.

Linear approximations may be used in estimating roots and powers. In the next example, we find the linear approximation
for f (x) = (1 + x)n at x = 0, which can be used to estimate roots and powers for real numbers near 1. The same idea
can be extended to a function of the form f (x) = (m + x)n to estimate roots and powers near a different number m.

     Because         L(x) = f (0) + f (0)(x - 0).

                     f (x) = (1 + x)n  f (0) = 1

     We can approximate (1.01)3 by evaluating L(0.01) when n = 3. We conclude that

     example.

Differentials

We have seen that linear approximations can be used to estimate function values. They can also be used to estimate the
amount a function value changes as a result of a small change in the input. To discuss this more formally, we define a related
concept: differentials. Differentials provide us with a way of estimating the amount a function changes as a result of a small
change in input values.

When we first looked at derivatives, we used the Leibniz notation dy/dx to represent the derivative of y with respect to

x. Although we used the expressions dy and dx in this notation, they did not have meaning on their own. Here we see a
meaning to the expressions dy and dx. Suppose y = f (x) is a differentiable function. Let dx be an independent variable that

can be assigned any nonzero real number, and define the dependent variable dy by

               dy = f (x)dx.                                                                               (4.2)

It is important to notice that dy is a function of both x and dx. The expressions dy and dx are called differentials. We can

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives                                                      359

divide both sides of Equation 4.2 by dx, which yields
                                                             dydx = f (x). (4.3)

This is the familiar expression we have used to denote a derivative. Equation 4.2 is known as the differential form of
Equation 4.3.

   Example 4.8

     Computing differentials

For each of the following functions, find dy and evaluate when x = 3 and dx = 0.1.
    a. y = x2 + 2x
    b. y = cos x

Solution
The key step is calculating the derivative. When we have that, we can obtain dy directly.

    a. Since f (x) = x2 + 2x, we know f (x) = 2x + 2, and therefore

                                                           dy = (2x + 2)dx.

When x = 3 and dx = 0.1,

b. Since f (x) = cos x,                                   dy = (2 · 3 + 2)(0.1) = 0.8.
                                         f (x) = -sin(x). This gives us

                                         dy = -sin x dx.

When x = 3 and dx = 0.1,

                                         dy = -sin(3)(0.1) = -0.1sin(3).

4.8 For y = ex2, find dy.

We now connect differentials to linear approximations. Differentials can be used to estimate the change in the value of a
function resulting from a small change in input values. Consider a function f that is differentiable at point a. Suppose

the input x changes by a small amount. We are interested in how much the output y changes. If x changes from a to

a + dx, then the change in x is dx (also denoted x), and the change in y is given by

                                                        y = f (a + dx) - f (a).

Instead of calculating the exact change in y, however, it is often easier to approximate the change in y by using a linear
approximation. For x near a, f (x) can be approximated by the linear approximation

Therefore, if dx is small,                            L(x) = f (a) + f (a)(x - a).
                                         f (a + dx)  L(a + dx) = f (a) + f (a)(a + dx - a).
360  Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

That is,

                                          f (a + dx) - f (a)  L(a + dx) - f (a) = f (a)dx.

In other words, the actual change in the function f if x increases from a to a + dx is approximately the difference
between L(a + dx) and f (a), where L(x) is the linear approximation of f at a. By definition of L(x), this difference
is equal to f (a)dx. In summary,

                                  y = f (a + dx) - f (a)  L(a + dx) - f (a) = f (a)dx = dy.

Therefore, we can use the differential dy = f (a)dx to approximate the change in y if x increases from x = a to
x = a + dx. We can see this in the following graph.

                        Figure 4.11 The differential dy = f (a)dx is used to approximate the actual
                        change in y if x increases from a to a + dx.

We now take a look at how to use differentials to approximate the change in the value of the function that results from a
small change in the value of the input. Note the calculation with differentials is much simpler than calculating actual values
of functions and the result is very close to what we would obtain with the more exact calculation.

   Example 4.9

     Approximating Change with Differentials
     Let y = x2 + 2x. Compute y and dy at x = 3 if dx = 0.1.
     Solution
     The actual change in y if x changes from x = 3 to x = 3.1 is given by

                                  y = f (3.1) - f (3) = [(3.1)2 + 2(3.1)] - [32 + 2(3)] = 0.81.
     The approximate change in y is given by dy = f (3)dx. Since f (x) = 2x + 2, we have

                                                dy = f (3)dx = (2(3) + 2)(0.1) = 0.8.

        4.9 For y = x2 + 2x, find y and dy at x = 3 if dx = 0.2.

Calculating the Amount of Error

Any type of measurement is prone to a certain amount of error. In many applications, certain quantities are calculated based
on measurements. For example, the area of a circle is calculated by measuring the radius of the circle. An error in the
measurement of the radius leads to an error in the computed value of the area. Here we examine this type of error and study
how differentials can be used to estimate the error.
Consider a function f with an input that is a measured quantity. Suppose the exact value of the measured quantity is a,
but the measured value is a + dx. We say the measurement error is dx (or x). As a result, an error occurs in the calculated
quantity f (x). This type of error is known as a propagated error and is given by

                                                        y = f (a + dx) - f (a).
Since all measurements are prone to some degree of error, we do not know the exact value of a measured quantity, so we
cannot calculate the propagated error exactly. However, given an estimate of the accuracy of a measurement, we can use
differentials to approximate the propagated error y. Specifically, if f is a differentiable function at a, the propagated
error is

                                                          y  dy = f (a)dx.
Unfortunately, we do not know the exact value a. However, we can use the measured value a + dx, and estimate

                                                       y  dy  f (a + dx)dx.
In the next example, we look at how differentials can be used to estimate the error in calculating the volume of a box if we
assume the measurement of the side length is made with a certain amount of accuracy.

   Example 4.10

     Volume of a Cube

      Suppose the side length of a cube is measured to be 5 cm with an accuracy of 0.1 cm.
           a. Use differentials to estimate the error in the computed volume of the cube.
           b. Compute the volume of the cube if the side length is (i) 4.9 cm and (ii) 5.1 cm to compare the estimated
               error with the actual potential error.

     Solution
          a. The measurement of the side length is accurate to within ±0.1 cm. Therefore,
                                                                 -0.1  dx  0.1.

               The volume of a cube is given by V = x3, which leads to

                                                                   dV = 3x2 dx.

               Using the measured side length of 5 cm, we can estimate that
                                                        -3(5)2(0.1)  dV  3(5)2(0.1).

               Therefore,
                                                                -7.5  dV  7.5.

           b. If the side length is actually 4.9 cm, then the volume of the cube is
                                                        V(4.9) = (4.9)3 = 117.649 cm3.
362                                                                               Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     If the side length is actually 5.1 cm, then the volume of the cube is
                                              V(5.1) = (5.1)3 = 132.651 cm3.

     Therefore, the actual volume of the cube is between 117.649 and 132.651. Since the side length is
     measured to be 5 cm, the computed volume is V(5) = 53 = 125. Therefore, the error in the computed
     volume is

                                         117.649 - 125  V  132.651 - 125.

     That is,

                                                     -7.351  V  7.651.

     We see the estimated error dV is relatively close to the actual potential error in the computed volume.

     4.10 Estimate the error in the computed volume of a cube if the side length is measured to be 6 cm with an
     accuracy of 0.2 cm.

The measurement error dx (=x) and the propagated error y are absolute errors. We are typically interested in the size
of an error relative to the size of the quantity being measured or calculated. Given an absolute error q for a particular

                                                 q
quantity, we define the relative error as q , where q is the actual value of the quantity. The percentage error is the
relative error expressed as a percentage. For example, if we measure the height of a ladder to be 63 in. when the actual
height is 62 in., the absolute error is 1 in. but the relative error is 1 = 0.016, or 1.6%. By comparison, if we measure the

                                                                          62
width of a piece of cardboard to be 8.25 in. when the actual width is 8 in., our absolute error is 1 in., whereas the relative

                                                                                                               4
error is 0.25 = 1 , or 3.1%. Therefore, the percentage error in the measurement of the cardboard is larger, even though

           8 32
0.25 in. is less than 1 in.

   Example 4.11

     Relative and Percentage Error

     An astronaut using a camera measures the radius of Earth as 4000 mi with an error of ±80 mi. Let's use
     differentials to estimate the relative and percentage error of using this radius measurement to calculate the volume
     of Earth, assuming the planet is a perfect sphere.

     Solution
     If the measurement of the radius is accurate to within ±80, we have

                                                     -80  dr  80.

     Since the volume of a sphere is given by  V  =  34 r 3, we have

                                                        dV = 4r2 dr.
Using the measured radius of 4000 mi, we can estimate

                                         -4(4000)2(80)  dV  4(4000)2(80).

To estimate the relative error, consider dV . Since we do not know the exact value of the volume V, use the
                                               V

measured radius  r  =  4000 mi           to estimate  V.  We obtain  V    34(4000)3.  Therefore the relative error satisfies

which simplifies to

The relative error is 0.06 and the percentage error is 6%.

     4.3.1  Define absolute extrema.
     4.3.2  Define local extrema.
     4.3.3  Explain how to find the critical points of a function over a closed interval.
     4.3.4  Describe how to use critical points to locate absolute extrema over a closed interval.

Given a particular function, we are often interested in determining the largest and smallest values of the function. This
information is important in creating accurate graphs. Finding the maximum and minimum values of a function also
has practical significance because we can use this method to solve optimization problems, such as maximizing profit,
minimizing the amount of material used in manufacturing an aluminum can, or finding the maximum height a rocket can
reach. In this section, we look at how to use derivatives to find the largest and smallest values for a function.

Absolute Extrema

Consider the function f (x) = x2 + 1 over the interval (-, ). As x  ±, f (x)  . Therefore, the function

does not have a largest value. However, since x2 + 1  1 for all real numbers x and x2 + 1 = 1 when x = 0, the
function has a smallest value, 1, when x = 0. We say that 1 is the absolute minimum of f (x) = x2 + 1 and it occurs at

x = 0. We say that f (x) = x2 + 1 does not have an absolute maximum (see the following figure).

                                       Figure 4.12 The given function has an absolute minimum of 1
                                   at x = 0. The function does not have an absolute maximum.

  Definition
  Let f be a function defined over an interval I and let c  I. We say f has an absolute maximum on I at c if
   f (c)  f (x) for all x  I. We say f has an absolute minimum on I at c if f (c)  f (x) for all x  I. If f has
  an absolute maximum on I at c or an absolute minimum on I at c, we say f has an absolute extremum on I at
   c.

Before proceeding, let's note two important issues regarding this definition. First, the term absolute here does not refer to
absolute value. An absolute extremum may be positive, negative, or zero. Second, if a function f has an absolute extremum
over an interval I at c, the absolute extremum is f (c). The real number c is a point in the domain at which the absolute
extremum occurs. For example, consider the function f (x) = 1/(x2 + 1) over the interval (-, ). Since

                                                       f (0) = 1  x21+ 1 = f (x)
for all real numbers x, we say f has an absolute maximum over (-, ) at x = 0. The absolute maximum is

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives  367

 f (0) = 1. It occurs at x = 0, as shown in Figure 4.13(b).

A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum, just one extremum, or neither. Figure 4.13
shows several functions and some of the different possibilities regarding absolute extrema. However, the following theorem,
called the Extreme Value Theorem, guarantees that a continuous function f over a closed, bounded interval [a, b] has
both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.

    Figure 4.13 Graphs (a), (b), and (c) show several possibilities for absolute extrema for functions with a domain of
    (-, ). Graphs (d), (e), and (f) show several possibilities for absolute extrema for functions with a domain that is a
    bounded interval.

  Theorem 4.1: Extreme Value Theorem
  If f is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [a, b], then there is a point in [a, b] at which f has
  an absolute maximum over [a, b] and there is a point in [a, b] at which f has an absolute minimum over [a, b].

The proof of the extreme value theorem is beyond the scope of this text. Typically, it is proved in a course on real analysis.
There are a couple of key points to note about the statement of this theorem. For the extreme value theorem to apply, the
368  Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

function must be continuous over a closed, bounded interval. If the interval I is open or the function has even one point
of discontinuity, the function may not have an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over I. For example, consider the
functions shown in Figure 4.13(d), (e), and (f). All three of these functions are defined over bounded intervals. However,
the function in graph (e) is the only one that has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum over its domain.
The extreme value theorem cannot be applied to the functions in graphs (d) and (f) because neither of these functions is
continuous over a closed, bounded interval. Although the function in graph (d) is defined over the closed interval [0, 4],
the function is discontinuous at x = 2. The function has an absolute maximum over [0, 4] but does not have an absolute
minimum. The function in graph (f) is continuous over the half-open interval [0, 2), but is not defined at x = 2, and
therefore is not continuous over a closed, bounded interval. The function has an absolute minimum over [0, 2), but does
not have an absolute maximum over [0, 2). These two graphs illustrate why a function over a bounded interval may fail to
have an absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum.

Before looking at how to find absolute extrema, let's examine the related concept of local extrema. This idea is useful in
determining where absolute extrema occur.

Local Extrema and Critical Points

Consider the function f shown in Figure 4.14. The graph can be described as two mountains with a valley in the middle.
The absolute maximum value of the function occurs at the higher peak, at x = 2. However, x = 0 is also a point of
interest. Although f (0) is not the largest value of f , the value f (0) is larger than f (x) for all x near 0. We say f has a
local maximum at x = 0. Similarly, the function f does not have an absolute minimum, but it does have a local minimum
at x = 1 because f (1) is less than f (x) for x near 1.

                                   Figure 4.14 This function f has two local maxima and one
                                   local minimum. The local maximum at x = 2 is also the
                                       absolute maximum.

  Definition
  A function f has a local maximum at c if there exists an open interval I containing c such that I is contained
  in the domain of f and f (c)  f (x) for all x  I. A function f has a local minimum at c if there exists an open
  interval I containing c such that I is contained in the domain of f and f (c)  f (x) for all x  I. A function f
  has a local extremum at c if f has a local maximum at c or f has a local minimum at c.

Note that if f has an absolute extremum at c and f is defined over an interval containing c, then f (c) is also
considered a local extremum. If an absolute extremum for a function f occurs at an endpoint, we do not consider that to be

a local extremum, but instead refer to that as an endpoint extremum.
Given the graph of a function f , it is sometimes easy to see where a local maximum or local minimum occurs. However,
it is not always easy to see, since the interesting features on the graph of a function may not be visible because they occur at
a very small scale. Also, we may not have a graph of the function. In these cases, how can we use a formula for a function
to determine where these extrema occur?
To answer this question, let's look at Figure 4.14 again. The local extrema occur at x = 0, x = 1, and x = 2. Notice
that at x = 0 and x = 1, the derivative f (x) = 0. At x = 2, the derivative f (x) does not exist, since the function
 f has a corner there. In fact, if f has a local extremum at a point x = c, the derivative f (c) must satisfy one of the
following conditions: either f (c) = 0 or f (c) is undefined. Such a value c is known as a critical point and it is important
in finding extreme values for functions.

  Definition
  Let c be an interior point in the domain of f . We say that c is a critical point of f if f (c) = 0 or f (c) is
   undefined.

As mentioned earlier, if f has a local extremum at a point x = c, then c must be a critical point of f . This fact is known
as Fermat's theorem.

  Theorem 4.2: Fermat's Theorem
  If f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c, then f (c) = 0.

Proof

Suppose f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c. We need to show that f (c) = 0. To do this, we
will show that f (c)  0 and f (c)  0, and therefore f (c) = 0. Since f has a local extremum at c, f has a local
maximum or local minimum at c. Suppose f has a local maximum at c. The case in which f has a local minimum
at c can be handled similarly. There then exists an open interval I such that f (c)  f (x) for all x  I. Since f is
differentiable at c, from the definition of the derivative, we know that

                                         f  (c)  =  lim       f (x) - f (c)  .
                                                              x-c
                                                    xc

Since this limit exists, both one-sided limits also exist and equal f (c). Therefore,

                                                              f (x) - f (c)                                (4.4)
                                         f (c) = lim          x-c ,

                                                           +
                                            xc

and

                                                          f (x) - f (c)                                    (4.5)
                                         f (c) = lim- x - c .

                                                    xc

Since f (c) is a local maximum, we see that f (x) - f (c)  0 for x near c. Therefore, for x near c, but x > c,

           f (x) - f (c)
we have x - c  0. From Equation 4.4 we conclude that f (c)  0. Similarly, it can be shown that f (c)  0.
Therefore, f (c) = 0.

                                                                                then either  f (c) = 0 or  f (c) is undefined.

From Fermat's theorem, we conclude that if f has a local extremum at c,
In other words, local extrema can only occur at critical points.
370  Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

Note this theorem does not claim that a function f must have a local extremum at a critical point. Rather, it states that

critical points are candidates for local extrema. For example, consider the function f (x) = x3. We have f (x) = 3x2 = 0

when x = 0. Therefore, x = 0 is a critical point. However, f (x) = x3 is increasing over (-, ), and thus f does
not have a local extremum at x = 0. In Figure 4.15, we see several different possibilities for critical points. In some of
these cases, the functions have local extrema at critical points, whereas in other cases the functions do not. Note that these
graphs do not show all possibilities for the behavior of a function at a critical point.

Figure 4.15 (a-e) A function f has a critical point at c if f (c) = 0 or f (c) is undefined. A function may or may not
have a local extremum at a critical point.

Later in this chapter we look at analytical methods for determining whether a function actually has a local extremum at a
critical point. For now, let's turn our attention to finding critical points. We will use graphical observations to determine
whether a critical point is associated with a local extremum.

   Example 4.12

     Locating Critical Points

      For each of the following functions, find all critical points. Use a graphing utility to determine whether the
      function has a local extremum at each of the critical points.

          a. f (x) = 1x3 - 5x2 + 4x

a. The derivative f (x) = x2 - 5x + 4 is defined for all real numbers x. Therefore, we only need to find

    the values for x where f (x) = 0. Since f (x) = x2 - 5x + 4 = (x - 4)(x - 1), the critical points are
     x = 1 and x = 4. From the graph of f in Figure 4.16, we see that f has a local maximum at x = 1
    and a local minimum at x = 4.

                                         Figure 4.16 This function has a local maximum and a local
                                         minimum.

b. Using the chain rule, we see the derivative is

                                          2 2               2 2
                                         f (x) = 3x - 1 (2x) = 6xx - 1 .

Therefore, f has critical points when x = 0 and when x2 - 1 = 0. We conclude that the critical points
are x = 0, ±1. From the graph of f in Figure 4.17, we see that f has a local (and absolute) minimum
at x = 0, but does not have a local extremum at x = 1 or x = -1.

                                         Figure 4.17 This function has three critical points: x = 0,
                                         x = 1, and x = -1. The function has a local (and absolute)
                                         minimum at x = 0, but does not have extrema at the other two
                                         critical points.

c. By the chain rule, we see that the derivative is

                                         f (x) = = 1 + x2 4 - 4x(2x) 4 - 4x2 .

                                                   1 + x   1 + x 

The derivative is defined everywhere. Therefore, we only need to find values for x where f (x) = 0.

Solving f (x) = 0, we see that 4 - 4x2 = 0, which implies x = ±1. Therefore, the critical points
are x = ±1. From the graph of f in Figure 4.18, we see that f has an absolute maximum at x = 1
372  Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     and an absolute minimum at x = -1. Hence, f has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at
     x = -1. (Note that if f has an absolute extremum over an interval I at a point c that is not an endpoint
     of I, then f has a local extremum at c.)

Locating Absolute Extrema

The extreme value theorem states that a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute maximum and
an absolute minimum. As shown in Figure 4.13, one or both of these absolute extrema could occur at an endpoint. If an
absolute extremum does not occur at an endpoint, however, it must occur at an interior point, in which case the absolute
extremum is a local extremum. Therefore, by Fermat's Theorem, the point c at which the local extremum occurs must
be a critical point. We summarize this result in the following theorem.

  Theorem 4.3: Location of Absolute Extrema
  Let f be a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval I. The absolute maximum of f over I and the
  absolute minimum of f over I must occur at endpoints of I or at critical points of f in I.

With this idea in mind, let's examine a procedure for locating absolute extrema.

  Problem-Solving Strategy: Locating Absolute Extrema over a Closed Interval
  Consider a continuous function f defined over the closed interval [a, b].

       1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = a and x = b.
       2. Find all critical points of f that lie over the interval (a, b) and evaluate f at those critical points.
       3. Compare all values found in (1) and (2). From Location of Absolute Extrema, the absolute extrema must

           occur at endpoints or critical points. Therefore, the largest of these values is the absolute maximum of f . The
           smallest of these values is the absolute minimum of f .

Now let's look at how to use this strategy to find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values for continuous
functions.

   Example 4.13

     Locating Absolute Extrema

For each of the following functions, find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum over the specified interval
and state where those values occur.

    a. f (x) = -x2 + 3x - 2 over [1, 3].

    b. f (x) = x2 - 3x2/3 over [0, 2].

Solution
    a. Step 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = 1 and x = 3.

                                                       f (1) = 0 and f (3) = -2

Step 2. Since f (x) = -2x + 3, f  is defined for all real numbers x. Therefore, there are no critical

points where the derivative is undefined. It remains to check where f (x) = 0. Since

f (x) = -2x + 3 = 0 at x = 3 and 3 is in the interval [1, 3],                     3 2  is  a  candidate  for  an  absolute
                                   22                                            f 

extremum of  f  over                     [1, 3].  We evaluate  23
                                                               f   and find

                                                                  f 3 = 1.
                                                                   2 4

Step 3. We set up the following table to compare the values found in steps 1 and 2.

                                                  x  f(x) Conclusion

                                                  0  0

                                                  3  1            Absolute maximum

                                                  2  4

                                                  3  -2           Absolute minimum

From the table, we find that the absolute maximum of f over the interval [1, 3] is 1, and it occurs at
                                                                                                  4

x = 3. The absolute minimum of f over the interval [1, 3] is -2, and it occurs at x = 3 as shown in
     2

the following graph.
374                                                                                                 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

                  Figure 4.19 This function has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.
     b. Step 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = 0 and x = 2.

                                              f (0) = 0 and f (2) = 4 - 33 4  - 0.762

     Step 2. The derivative of f is given by

                         2 2x4/3 - 2                 x                            x
        f (x) = 2x - 1/3 = 1/3

     for x  0. The derivative is zero when 2x4/3 - 2 = 0, which implies x = ±1. The derivative is
     undefined at x = 0. Therefore, the critical points of f are x = 0, 1, -1. The point x = 0 is an
     endpoint, so we already evaluated f (0) in step 1. The point x = -1 is not in the interval of interest, so
     we need only evaluate f (1). We find that

                                                           f (1) = -2.

     Step 3. We compare the values found in steps 1 and 2, in the following table.

     x                                        f (x)                               Conclusion

     00                                                                           Absolute maximum

     1 -2                                                                         Absolute minimum

     2 -0.762

     We conclude that the absolute maximum of f over the interval [0, 2] is zero, and it occurs at x = 0. The
     absolute minimum is -2, and it occurs at x = 1 as shown in the following graph.

At this point, we know how to locate absolute extrema for continuous functions over closed intervals. We have also defined
local extrema and determined that if a function f has a local extremum at a point c, then c must be a critical point of f .
However, c being a critical point is not a sufficient condition for f to have a local extremum at c. Later in this chapter,
we show how to determine whether a function actually has a local extremum at a critical point. First, however, we need to
introduce the Mean Value Theorem, which will help as we analyze the behavior of the graph of a function.

4.4 | The Mean Value Theorem

                                    Learning Objectives

         4.4.1 Explain the meaning of Rolle's theorem.
         4.4.2 Describe the significance of the Mean Value Theorem.
         4.4.3 State three important consequences of the Mean Value Theorem.

The Mean Value Theorem is one of the most important theorems in calculus. We look at some of its implications at the
end of this section. First, let's start with a special case of the Mean Value Theorem, called Rolle's theorem.

Rolle's Theorem

Informally, Rolle's theorem states that if the outputs of a differentiable function f are equal at the endpoints of an interval,
then there must be an interior point c where f (c) = 0. Figure 4.21 illustrates this theorem.

      Figure 4.21 If a differentiable function f satisfies f (a) = f (b), then its derivative must be zero at some point(s)
      between a and b.

  Theorem 4.4: Rolle's Theorem
  Let f be a continuous function over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over the open interval (a, b) such
  that f (a) = f (b). There then exists at least one c  (a, b) such that f (c) = 0.

Proof
Let k = f (a) = f (b). We consider three cases:

    1. f (x) = k for all x  (a, b).
    2. There exists x  (a, b) such that f (x) > k.
    3. There exists x  (a, b) such that f (x) < k.
Case 1: If f (x) = k for all x  (a, b), then f (x) = 0 for all x  (a, b).
Case 2: Since f is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [a, b], by the extreme value theorem, it has
an absolute maximum. Also, since there is a point x  (a, b) such that f (x) > k, the absolute maximum is greater than
k. Therefore, the absolute maximum does not occur at either endpoint. As a result, the absolute maximum must occur at an
interior point c  (a, b). Because f has a maximum at an interior point c, and f is differentiable at c, by Fermat's
theorem, f (c) = 0.
380                                                                               Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

Case 3: The case when there exists a point x  (a, b) such that f (x) < k is analogous to case 2, with maximum replaced
by minimum.



An important point about Rolle's theorem is that the differentiability of the function f is critical. If f is not differentiable,

even at a single point, the result may not hold. For example, the function f (x) = |x| - 1 is continuous over [-1, 1] and

 f (-1) = 0 = f (1), but f (c)  0 for any c  (-1, 1) as shown in the following figure.

                          Figure 4.22 Since f (x) = |x| - 1 is not differentiable at

                                    x = 0, the conditions of Rolle's theorem are not satisfied. In
                                   fact, the conclusion does not hold here; there is no c  (-1, 1)
                                   such that f (c) = 0.

Let's now consider functions that satisfy the conditions of Rolle's theorem and calculate explicitly the points c where
 f (c) = 0.

   Example 4.14

     Using Rolle's Theorem

      For each of the following functions, verify that the function satisfies the criteria stated in Rolle's theorem and find
     all values c in the given interval where f (c) = 0.

          a. f (x) = x2 + 2x over [-2, 0]
          b. f (x) = x3 - 4x over [-2, 2]

     Solution
          a. Since f is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable everywhere. In addition, f (-2) = 0 = f (0).
               Therefore, f satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. We conclude that there exists at least one value
               c  (-2, 0) such that f (c) = 0. Since f (x) = 2x + 2 = 2(x + 1), we see that
                f (c) = 2(c + 1) = 0 implies c = -1 as shown in the following graph.

                                Figure 4.23 This function is continuous and differentiable
                             over [-2, 0], f (c) = 0 when c = -1.

b. As in part a. f is a polynomial and therefore is continuous and differentiable everywhere. Also,
     f (-2) = 0 = f (2). That said, f satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Differentiating, we find that
     f (x) = 3x2 - 4. Therefore, f (c) = 0 when x = ± 2 . Both points are in the interval [-2, 2], and,
                                                                    3
    therefore, both points satisfy the conclusion of Rolle's theorem as shown in the following graph.

The Mean Value Theorem and Its Meaning

Rolle's theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem. In Rolle's theorem, we consider differentiable functions f

defined on a closed interval  [a, b]    with          f     .  The  Mean      Value   Theorem  generalizes     Rolle's     theorem  by  considering

                                              f a =      b

functions that do not necessarily have equal value at the endpoints. Consequently, we can view the Mean Value Theorem
as a slanted version of Rolle's theorem (Figure 4.25). The Mean Value Theorem states that if f is continuous over the

closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c  (a, b) such that the

tangent line to the graph of  f  at  c  is parallel to the secant line connecting              f (a)      and      f (b).

                                                                                      a,                       b,

                                 Figure 4.25 The Mean Value Theorem says that for a function
                                 that meets its conditions, at some point the tangent line has the
                                 same slope as the secant line between the ends. For this
                                 function, there are two values c1 and c2 such that the tangent

                                 line to f at c1 and c2 has the same slope as the secant line.

Theorem 4.5: Mean Value Theorem
Let f be continuous over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over the open interval (a, b). Then, there
exists at least one point c  (a, b) such that

                                                        f (c) = f (b) - f (a) b - a .

Proof

The proof follows from Rolle's theorem by introducing an appropriate function that satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem.

Consider the line connecting         f (a)  and       f (b).   Since the slope of that line is

                                 a,              b,

and the line passes through the point         f (a),          f (b) - f (a)
                                                                 b-a
                                        a,
                                                      the equation of that line can be written as

                                                 y = f (b) - f (a) b - a (x - a) + f (a).

Let  g(x)  denote the vertical difference between the point             f  (  x       and the point  (x,  y)  on that line. Therefore,

                                                                    x,            )

                                            g(x) = f (x) -      f (b) - f (a)         (x - a) + f (a).

                                                                    b-a

                              Figure 4.26 The value g(x) is the vertical difference
                              between the point (x, f (x)) and the point (x, y) on the secant
                              line connecting (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)).

Since the graph of f intersects the secant line when x = a and x = b, we see that g(a) = 0 = g(b). Since f is a
differentiable function over (a, b), g is also a differentiable function over (a, b). Furthermore, since f is continuous
over [a, b], g is also continuous over [a, b]. Therefore, g satisfies the criteria of Rolle's theorem. Consequently, there
exists a point c  (a, b) such that g(c) = 0. Since

                                         g(x) = f (x) - f (b) - f (a) b - a ,

we see that

                                           g(c) = f (c) - f (b) - f (a) b - a .

Since g(c) = 0, we conclude that

                                                          f (c) = f (b) - f (a) b - a .


In the next example, we show how the Mean Value Theorem can be applied to the function f (x) = x over the interval
[0, 9]. The method is the same for other functions, although sometimes with more interesting consequences.

Example 4.15

Verifying that the Mean Value Theorem Applies

For f (x) = x over the interval [0, 9], show that f satisfies the hypothesis of the Mean Value Theorem, and

therefore there exists at least one value c  (0, 9) such that f (c) is equal to the slope of the line connecting

    f (0)    and      f (9).  Find these values  c   guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem.

0,                9,

Solution

We know that f (x) = x is continuous over [0, 9] and differentiable over (0, 9). Therefore, f satisfies the

hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem, and there must exist at least one value c  (0, 9) such that f  (c) is

equal to the slope of the line connecting            f (0)  and      f (9)  (Figure  4.27). To determine which value(s)

                                                 0,              9,

     of c are guaranteed, first calculate the derivative of f . The derivative f  (x) = (21x). The slope of the line
     connecting (0, f (0)) and (9, f (9)) is given by

     f (9) - f (0) = 9 - 0 = 3 = 1.
     9-0  9-0 9 3

     We want to find c such that f (c) = 1. That is, we want to find c such that
                                                3

                                                                  1 = 1.
                                                                2c 3

     Solving this equation for c, we obtain c = 9. At this point, the slope of the tangent line equals the slope of the
                                                         4

     line joining the endpoints.

          Figure 4.27 The slope of the tangent line at c = 9/4 is the same as the slope of the line segment
          connecting (0, 0) and (9, 3).

One application that helps illustrate the Mean Value Theorem involves velocity. For example, suppose we drive a car for
1 h down a straight road with an average velocity of 45 mph. Let s(t) and v(t) denote the position and velocity of the
car, respectively, for 0  t  1 h. Assuming that the position function s(t) is differentiable, we can apply the Mean Value
Theorem to conclude that, at some time c  (0, 1), the speed of the car was exactly

                                                v(c) = s (c) = s(1) - s(0) = 45 mph.
                                                                     1-0

    a. Determine how long it takes before the rock hits the ground.
    b. Find the average velocity vavg of the rock for when the rock is released and the rock hits the ground.

    c. Find the time t guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem when the instantaneous velocity of the rock is
         v avg .

Solution

a. When the rock hits the ground, its position is s(t) = 0. Solving the equation -16t2 + 100 = 0 for t,

we find that t = ±5 sec. Since we are only considering t  0, the ball will hit the ground 5 sec after22

it is dropped.

b. The average velocity is given by

                                            vavg = s(5/2) - s(0) = 0 - 100 = -40 ft/sec.
                                            5/2 - 0  5/2

c. The instantaneous velocity is given by the derivative of the position function. Therefore, we need to find

a time t such that v(t) = s(t) = vavg = -40 ft/sec. Since s(t) is continuous over the interval [0, 5/2]

and differentiable over the interval (0, 5/2), by the Mean Value Theorem, there is guaranteed to be a

point c  (0, 5/2) such that

                                            s (c) = s(5/2) - s(0) 5/2 - 0 = -40.

Taking the derivative of the position function s(t), we find that s (t) = -32t. Therefore, the equation

reduces to s (c) = -32c = -40. Solving this equation for c, we have c = 5. Therefore, 5 sec after44

the rock is dropped, the instantaneous velocity equals the average velocity of the rock during its free fall:

-40 ft/sec.

                               Figure 4.28 At time t = 5/4 sec, the velocity of the rock is
                                   equal to its average velocity from the time it is dropped until it
                                   hits the ground.

time t when the instantaneous velocity of the ball equals its average velocity.

Corollaries of the Mean Value Theorem

Let's now look at three corollaries of the Mean Value Theorem. These results have important consequences, which we use
in upcoming sections.
At this point, we know the derivative of any constant function is zero. The Mean Value Theorem allows us to conclude
that the converse is also true. In particular, if f  (x) = 0 for all x in some interval I, then f (x) is constant over that
interval. This result may seem intuitively obvious, but it has important implications that are not obvious, and we discuss
them shortly.

  Theorem 4.6: Corollary 1: Functions with a Derivative of Zero
  Let f be differentiable over an interval I. If f  (x) = 0 for all x  I, then f (x) = constant for all x  I.

Proof
Since f is differentiable over I, f must be continuous over I. Suppose f (x) is not constant for all x in I. Then there
exist a, b  I, where a  b and f (a)  f (b). Choose the notation so that a < b. Therefore,

                                                             f (b) - f (a) b - a  0.
Since f is a differentiable function, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists c  (a, b) such that

                                                          f  (c) = f (b) - f (a) b - a .
Therefore, there exists c  I such that f  (c)  0, which contradicts the assumption that f  (x) = 0 for all x  I.

From Corollary 1: Functions with a Derivative of Zero, it follows that if two functions have the same derivative,
they differ by, at most, a constant.

  Theorem 4.7: Corollary 2: Constant Difference Theorem
  If f and g are differentiable over an interval I and f  (x) = g (x) for all x  I, then f (x) = g(x) + C for some
  constant C.

Proof

Let h(x) = f (x) - g(x). Then, h (x) = f  (x) - g (x) = 0 for all x  I. By Corollary 1, there is a constant C such that
h(x) = C for all x  I. Therefore, f (x) = g(x) + C for all x  I.



The third corollary of the Mean Value Theorem discusses when a function is increasing and when it is decreasing. Recall
that a function f is increasing over I if f (x1) < f (x2) whenever x1 < x2, whereas f is decreasing over I if
 f (x)1 > f (x2) whenever x1 < x2. Using the Mean Value Theorem, we can show that if the derivative of a function is
positive, then the function is increasing; if the derivative is negative, then the function is decreasing (Figure 4.29). We
make use of this fact in the next section, where we show how to use the derivative of a function to locate local maximum
and minimum values of the function, and how to determine the shape of the graph.

This fact is important because it means that for a given function f , if there exists a function F such that F (x) = f (x);
then, the only other functions that have a derivative equal to f are F(x) + C for some constant C. We discuss this result
in more detail later in the chapter.

                Figure 4.29 If a function has a positive derivative over some interval I, then the function
                increases over that interval I; if the derivative is negative over some interval I, then the
                function decreases over that interval I.

  Theorem 4.8: Corollary 3: Increasing and Decreasing Functions
  Let f be continuous over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over the open interval (a, b).

       i. If f  (x) > 0 for all x  (a, b), then f is an increasing function over [a, b].
      ii. If f (x) < 0 for all x  (a, b), then f is a decreasing function over [a, b].

Proof

We will prove i.; the proof of ii. is similar. Suppose f is not an increasing function on I. Then there exist a and b in I
such that a < b, but f (a)  f (b). Since f is a differentiable function over I, by the Mean Value Theorem there exists
c  (a, b) such that

Since  f (a)  f (b),  we know that                       f  (c) = f (b) - f (a) b - a .
                                         f (b) - f (a)  0. Also, a < b tells us that b - a > 0. We conclude that

                                                        f  (c) = f (b) - f (a) b - a  0.
However, f  (x) > 0 for all x  I. This is a contradiction, and therefore f must be an increasing function over I.

         4.5.1 Explain how the sign of the first derivative affects the shape of a function's graph.
         4.5.2 State the first derivative test for critical points.
         4.5.3 Use concavity and inflection points to explain how the sign of the second derivative affects
         the shape of a function's graph.
         4.5.4 Explain the concavity test for a function over an open interval.
         4.5.5 Explain the relationship between a function and its first and second derivatives.
         4.5.6 State the second derivative test for local extrema.

Earlier in this chapter we stated that if a function f has a local extremum at a point c, then c must be a critical point
of f . However, a function is not guaranteed to have a local extremum at a critical point. For example, f (x) = x3 has a
critical point at x = 0 since f (x) = 3x2 is zero at x = 0, but f does not have a local extremum at x = 0. Using the
results from the previous section, we are now able to determine whether a critical point of a function actually corresponds
to a local extreme value. In this section, we also see how the second derivative provides information about the shape of a
graph by describing whether the graph of a function curves upward or curves downward.

The First Derivative Test

Corollary 3 of the Mean Value Theorem showed that if the derivative of a function is positive over an interval I then the
function is increasing over I. On the other hand, if the derivative of the function is negative over an interval I, then the
function is decreasing over I as shown in the following figure.

                                       Figure 4.30 Both functions are increasing over the interval
                                    (a, b). At each point x, the derivative f (x) > 0. Both
                                   functions are decreasing over the interval (a, b). At each point

A continuous function f has a local maximum at point c if and only if f switches from increasing to decreasing at
point c. Similarly, f has a local minimum at c if and only if f switches from decreasing to increasing at c. If f is a
continuous function over an interval I containing c and differentiable over I, except possibly at c, the only way f
can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at point c is if f  changes sign as x increases through c. If
 f is differentiable at c, the only way that f . can change sign as x increases through c is if f  (c) = 0. Therefore,
for a function f that is continuous over an interval I containing c and differentiable over I, except possibly at c, the
only way f can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) is if f (c) = 0 or f  (c) is undefined. Consequently,
to locate local extrema for a function f , we look for points c in the domain of f such that f (c) = 0 or f  (c) is
undefined. Recall that such points are called critical points of f .

Note that f need not have a local extrema at a critical point. The critical points are candidates for local extrema only. In
Figure 4.31, we show that if a continuous function f has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point, but a function
may not have a local extremum at a critical point. We show that if f has a local extremum at a critical point, then the sign
of f  switches as x increases through that point.

       Figure 4.31 The function f has four critical points: a, b, c, and d. The function f has local maxima at a
       and d, and a local minimum at b. The function f does not have a local extremum at c. The sign of f 
        changes at all local extrema.

Using Figure 4.31, we summarize the main results regarding local extrema.
     · If a continuous function f has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point c.
     · The function has a local extremum at the critical point c if and only if the derivative f  switches sign as x
         increases through c.
     · Therefore, to test whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point c, we must determine the sign of
          f  (x) to the left and right of c.

This result is known as the first derivative test.

Theorem 4.9: First Derivative Test
Suppose that f is a continuous function over an interval I containing a critical point c. If f is differentiable over
I, except possibly at point c, then f (c) satisfies one of the following descriptions:

     i. If f  changes sign from positive when x < c to negative when x > c, then f (c) is a local maximum of f .
    ii. If f  changes sign from negative when x < c to positive when x > c, then f (c) is a local minimum of f .
   iii. If f  has the same sign for x < c and x > c, then f (c) is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum of

          f.

We can summarize the first derivative test as a strategy for locating local extrema.

  Problem-Solving Strategy: Using the First Derivative Test
  Consider a function f that is continuous over an interval I.

       1. Find all critical points of f and divide the interval I into smaller intervals using the critical points as
            endpoints.

       2. Analyze the sign of f  in each of the subintervals. If f  is continuous over a given subinterval (which is
           typically the case), then the sign of f  in that subinterval does not change and, therefore, can be determined
           by choosing an arbitrary test point x in that subinterval and by evaluating the sign of f  at that test point. Use
           the sign analysis to determine whether f is increasing or decreasing over that interval.

       3. Use First Derivative Test and the results of step 2 to determine whether f has a local maximum, a local
            minimum, or neither at each of the critical points.

Now let's look at how to use this strategy to locate all local extrema for particular functions.

   Example 4.17

     Using the First Derivative Test to Find Local Extrema

     Use the first derivative test to find the location of all local extrema for f (x) = x3 - 3x2 - 9x - 1. Use a
      graphing utility to confirm your results.

     Solution
     Step 1. The derivative is f  (x) = 3x2 - 6x - 9. To find the critical points, we need to find where f  (x) = 0.
      Factoring the polynomial, we conclude that the critical points must satisfy

                                                3(x2 - 2x - 3) = 3(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0.
     Therefore, the critical points are x = 3, -1. Now divide the interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals
      (-, -1), (-1, 3) and (3, ).
     Step 2. Since f  is a continuous function, to determine the sign of f  (x) over each subinterval, it suffices to
     choose a point over each of the intervals (-, -1), (-1, 3) and (3, ) and determine the sign of f  at each

of these points. For example, let's choose x = -2, x = 0, and x = 4 as test points.

                                                                                     f is increasing.

Step 3. Since f  switches sign from positive to negative as x increases through 1, f has a local maximum at
x = -1. Since f  switches sign from negative to positive as x increases through 3, f has a local minimum at
x = 3. These analytical results agree with the following graph.

     Example 4.18

       Using the First Derivative Test

     Use the first derivative test to find the location of all local extrema for f (x) = 5x1/3 - x5/3. Use a graphing
     utility to confirm your results.

     Solution
     Step 1. The derivative is

               f  (x) = 5 x-2/3 - 5 x2/3 = 5 - 5x2/3 = 5 - 5x4/3 = 5 . 1 - x4/3

     The derivative f  (x) = 0 when 1 - x4/3 = 0. Therefore, f  (x) = 0 at x = ±1. The derivative f  (x) is
     undefined at x = 0. Therefore, we have three critical points: x = 0, x = 1, and x = -1. Consequently,
     divide the interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, ).

     Step 2: Since f  is continuous over each subinterval, it suffices to choose a test point x in each of the
     intervals from step 1 and determine the sign of f  at each of these points. The points

     x = -2, x = - 1, x = 1, and x = 2 are test points for these intervals.

     Step 3: Since f is decreasing over the interval (-, -1) and increasing over the interval (-1, 0), f has a
     local minimum at x = -1. Since f is increasing over the interval (-1, 0) and the interval (0, 1), f does not
     have a local extremum at x = 0. Since f is increasing over the interval (0, 1) and decreasing over the interval
     (1, ), f has a local maximum at x = 1. The analytical results agree with the following graph.

        4.17 Use the first derivative test to find all local extrema for f (x) = 3 x - 1.

Concavity and Points of Inflection

We now know how to determine where a function is increasing or decreasing. However, there is another issue to consider
regarding the shape of the graph of a function. If the graph curves, does it curve upward or curve downward? This notion is
called the concavity of the function.
Figure 4.34(a) shows a function f with a graph that curves upward. As x increases, the slope of the tangent line
increases. Thus, since the derivative increases as x increases, f  is an increasing function. We say this function f is
concave up. Figure 4.34(b) shows a function f that curves downward. As x increases, the slope of the tangent line
decreases. Since the derivative decreases as x increases, f  is a decreasing function. We say this function f is concave
down.

  Definition
  Let f be a function that is differentiable over an open interval I. If f  is increasing over I, we say f is concave
  up over I. If f  is decreasing over I, we say f is concave down over I.
396  Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

                        Figure 4.34 (a), (c) Since f  is increasing over the interval (a, b), we say f
                        is concave up over (a, b). (b), (d) Since f  is decreasing over the interval
                         (a, b), we say f is concave down over (a, b).

In general, without having the graph of a function f , how can we determine its concavity? By definition, a function f is
concave up if f  is increasing. From Corollary 3, we know that if f  is a differentiable function, then f  is increasing
if its derivative f (x) > 0. Therefore, a function f that is twice differentiable is concave up when f (x) > 0. Similarly,
a function f is concave down if f  is decreasing. We know that a differentiable function f  is decreasing if its derivative
 f (x) < 0. Therefore, a twice-differentiable function f is concave down when f (x) < 0. Applying this logic is known
as the concavity test.

  Theorem 4.10: Test for Concavity
  Let f be a function that is twice differentiable over an interval I.

        i. If f (x) > 0 for all x  I, then f is concave up over I.
       ii. If f (x) < 0 for all x  I, then f is concave down over I.

We conclude that we can determine the concavity of a function f by looking at the second derivative of f . In addition, we
observe that a function f can switch concavity (Figure 4.35). However, a continuous function can switch concavity only
at a point x if f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. Consequently, to determine the intervals where a function f is concave
up and concave down, we look for those values of x where f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. When we have determined

these points, we divide the domain of f into smaller intervals and determine the sign of f  over each of these smaller

intervals. If f  changes sign as we pass through a point x, then f changes concavity. It is important to remember that a

function f may not change concavity at a point x even if f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. If, however, f does change

concavity at a point a and  f is continuous at a,  we say the point               f (a)  is an inflection point of  f.

                                                                              a,

  Testing for Concavity

  For the function f (x) = x3 - 6x2 + 9x + 30, determine all intervals where f is concave up and all intervals
  where f is concave down. List all inflection points for f . Use a graphing utility to confirm your results.

  Solution
  To determine concavity, we need to find the second derivative f (x). The first derivative is
   f (x) = 3x2 - 12x + 9, so the second derivative is f (x) = 6x - 12. If the function changes concavity, it
  occurs either when f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. Since f  is defined for all real numbers x, we need only
  find where f (x) = 0. Solving the equation 6x - 12 = 0, we see that x = 2 is the only place where f could
  change concavity. We now test points over the intervals (-, 2) and (2, ) to determine the concavity of f .
  The points x = 0 and x = 3 are test points for these intervals.

  Figure 4.37 Consider a twice-differentiable function f over an open interval I. If f (x) > 0 for all x  I, the
  function is increasing over I. If f (x) < 0 for all x  I, the function is decreasing over I. If f (x) > 0 for all
   x  I, the function is concave up. If f (x) < 0 for all x  I, the function is concave down on I.

The Second Derivative Test

The first derivative test provides an analytical tool for finding local extrema, but the second derivative can also be used to
locate extreme values. Using the second derivative can sometimes be a simpler method than using the first derivative.

We know that if a continuous function has a local extrema, it must occur at a critical point. However, a function need not
have a local extrema at a critical point. Here we examine how the second derivative test can be used to determine whether
a function has a local extremum at a critical point. Let f be a twice-differentiable function such that f  (a) = 0 and f 
is continuous over an open interval I containing a. Suppose f (a) < 0. Since f  is continuous over I, f (x) < 0 for
all x  I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3, f  is a decreasing function over I. Since f  (a) = 0, we conclude that
for all x  I, f  (x) > 0 if x < a and f  (x) < 0 if x > a. Therefore, by the first derivative test, f has a local maximum
at x = a. On the other hand, suppose there exists a point b such that f  (b) = 0 but f (b) > 0. Since f  is continuous
over an open interval I containing b, then f (x) > 0 for all x  I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3, f  is an
increasing function over I. Since f  (b) = 0, we conclude that for all x  I, f  (x) < 0 if x < b and f  (x) > 0 if
x > b. Therefore, by the first derivative test, f has a local minimum at x = b.

                                   Figure 4.38 Consider a twice-differentiable function f such
                                   that f  is continuous. Since f (a) = 0 and f (a) < 0,
                                   there is an interval I containing a such that for all x in I, f
                                   is increasing if x < a and f is decreasing if x > a. As a
                                   result, f has a local maximum at x = a. Since f (b) = 0
                                   and f (b) > 0, there is an interval I containing b such that
                                   for all x in I, f is decreasing if x < b and f is increasing
                                   if x > b. As a result, f has a local minimum at x = b.

  Theorem 4.11: Second Derivative Test
  Suppose f  (c) = 0, f  is continuous over an interval containing c.

        i. If f (c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c.
       ii. If f (c) < 0, then f has a local maximum at c.
      iii. If f (c) = 0, then the test is inconclusive.

Note that for case iii. when f (c) = 0, then f may have a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at c. For
example, the functions f (x) = x3, f (x) = x4, and f (x) = -x4 all have critical points at x = 0. In each case, the
second derivative is zero at x = 0. However, the function f (x) = x4 has a local minimum at x = 0 whereas the function
 f (x) = -x4 has a local maximum at x, and the function f (x) = x3 does not have a local extremum at x = 0.
Let's now look at how to use the second derivative test to determine whether f has a local maximum or local minimum at
a critical point c where f  (c) = 0.

   Example 4.20

     Using the Second Derivative Test

     Use the second derivative to find the location of all local extrema for f (x) = x5 - 5x3.

     Solution
     To apply the second derivative test, we first need to find critical points c where f  (c) = 0. The derivative is

f  (x) = 5x4 - 15x2.  Therefore,             f    (x)  =  5x4  -  15x 2  =  5x2  2  -      =   0  when  x = 0, ±  3.

                                                                                 x     3

To determine whether f has a local extrema at any of these points, we need to evaluate the sign of f  at these
points. The second derivative is

                                                  f  (x)  =  20x 3  -  30x  =  10x2x 2  -    

                                                                                           3.

In the following table, we evaluate the second derivative at each of the critical points and use the second
derivative test to determine whether f has a local maximum or local minimum at any of these points.

                                         -3     -30 3 Local maximum

By the second derivative test, we conclude that f has a local maximum at x = - 3 and f has a local minimum

at x = 3. The second derivative test is inconclusive at x = 0. To determine whether f has a local extrema at

x = 0,    we apply the first derivative test. To evaluate the sign of                  f  (x)  =     2 2    for                       and

                                                                                                  5x x - 3        x  -      3, 0

              let x = -1 and x = 1 be the two test points. Since f  (-1) < 0 and f  (1) < 0,                          we conclude

x  0,     3,

that f is decreasing on both intervals and, therefore, f does not have a local extrema at x = 0 as shown in the

following graph.

We have now developed the tools we need to determine where a function is increasing and decreasing, as well as acquired
an understanding of the basic shape of the graph. In the next section we discuss what happens to a function as x  ±.

           4.6.5  Analyze a function and its derivatives to draw its graph.

We have shown how to use the first and second derivatives of a function to describe the shape of a graph. To graph a
function f defined on an unbounded domain, we also need to know the behavior of f as x  ±. In this section, we

define limits at infinity and show how these limits affect the graph of a function. At the end of this section, we outline a
strategy for graphing an arbitrary function f .

Limits at Infinity

We begin by examining what it means for a function to have a finite limit at infinity. Then we study the idea of a function
with an infinite limit at infinity. Back in Introduction to Functions and Graphs, we looked at vertical asymptotes; in
this section we deal with horizontal and oblique asymptotes.

Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes

Recall that  lim  f  (x)  =  L  means    f (x)  becomes arbitrarily close to  L  as long as        x  is sufficiently close to  a.  We can

             xa

extend this idea to limits at infinity. For example, consider the function           f  (x)  =  2  +  1.  As can be seen graphically in
                                                                                                      x

Figure 4.40 and numerically in Table 4.2, as the values of x get larger, the values of f (x) approach 2. We say the limit

as x approaches  of f (x) is 2 and write x lim f (x) = 2. Similarly, for x < 0, as the values |x| get larger, the values

of  f (x)  approaches  2.  We say the limit as  x  approaches  -  of  f (x)      is  2  and write     x   lim  f  (x)  =  2.

More generally, for any function f , we say the limit as x   of f (x) is L if f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to

L as long as x is sufficiently large. In that case, we write x lim f (x) = L. Similarly, we say the limit as x  - of

f (x) is L if f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to L as long as x < 0 and |x| is sufficiently large. In that case, we write

x  lim     f  (x)  =  L.  We now look at the definition of a function having a limit at infinity.

   Definition

   (Informal) If the values of f (x) become arbitrarily close to L as x becomes sufficiently large, we say the function
    f has a limit at infinity and write

                                                             x lim f (x) = L.

   If the values of f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to L for x < 0 as |x| becomes sufficiently large, we say that the
   function f has a limit at negative infinity and write

                                                             x  lim  f  (x)       =  L.

If the values f (x) are getting arbitrarily close to some finite value L as x   or x  -, the graph of f approaches

the line y = L. In that case, the line y = L is a horizontal asymptote of f (Figure 4.41). For example, for the function

f  (x)  =  1,      since x lim f (x) = 0,      the line y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote of  f  (x)  =  1.

   If   x lim f (x)   =   L  or  x  lim  f  (x)  =  L,  we say the line y = L is a horizontal asymptote of  f.

               is a horizontal asymptote of f . (b) As x  -, the values of f are getting arbitrarily close to

A function cannot cross a vertical asymptote because the graph must approach infinity (or -) from at least one direction
as x approaches the vertical asymptote. However, a function may cross a horizontal asymptote. In fact, a function may

                                                                                                           (cos x)
cross a horizontal asymptote an unlimited number of times. For example, the function f (x) = x + 1 shown in Figure
4.42 intersects the horizontal asymptote y = 1 an infinite number of times as it oscillates around the asymptote with ever-
decreasing amplitude.

                      Figure 4.42 The graph of f (x) = (cos x)/x + 1 crosses its
                      horizontal asymptote y = 1 an infinite number of times.

The algebraic limit laws and squeeze theorem we introduced in Introduction to Limits also apply to limits at infinity. We
illustrate how to use these laws to compute several limits at infinity.

     Solution

     a. Using          the                 algebraic                              limit                     laws,  we         have
                                                                                                                            and f
                2                          1          1      =                       5        ·
     x lim5 -       2  =       lim 5  -  2x lim x.x lim x                               -  2     0  =   5.
                 x
                              x

     Similarly, x lim-  f (x) = 5. Therefore, f (x) = 5 - 2x2 has a horizontal asymptote of                            y=5

     approaches this horizontal asymptote as x  ± as shown in the following graph.

                              Figure 4.43 This function approaches a horizontal asymptote
                              as x  ±.

     b. Since -1  sin x  1 for all x, we have
                                                            -1  sin x  1
                                                             x xx

     for all x  0. Also, since

                                           lim        -1  =                       0  =     lim      1,
                                           x           x                                x           x

     we can apply the squeeze theorem to conclude that
                                                         lim sin x = 0.
                                                        x x

     Similarly,

                                                        lim sin x = 0.
                                                      x  - x

     Thus,     f (x) = sin x  has a horizontal asymptote of  y=0                           and      f (x)   approaches this horizontal asymptote
                         x

     as x  ± as shown in the following graph.

                 Figure 4.44 This function crosses its horizontal asymptote multiple times.

c. To evaluate lim tan-1 (x) and lim tan-1 (x), we first consider the graph of y = tan(x) over the

                                            x  (/2)

it follows that                             lim tan-1(x) =  .2
Similarly, since                            x

                                                lim tan x = -,

                                            x  (-/2)+

it follows that

Infinite Limits at Infinity

Sometimes the values of a function f become arbitrarily large as x   (or as x  -). In this case, we write

x lim f (x) =   (or  x  lim  f  (x)  =  ).  On the other hand, if the values of              f  are negative but become arbitrarily large in

                         -

magnitude as x   (or as x  -),              we write  x lim f (x)  =              -  (or  x  lim  f  (x)  =  -).

                                                                                              -

For example, consider the function f (x) = x3. As seen in Table 4.3 and Figure 4.47, as x   the values f (x)

become arbitrarily large. Therefore,     lim x3 = .   On the other hand, as                     x  -,        the values of    f (x) = x3 are

                                        x

Definition
(Informal) We say a function f has an infinite limit at infinity and write

if f (x) < 0 and | f (x)| becomes arbitrarily large for x sufficiently large. Similarly, we can define infinite limits as

x  -.

Formal Definitions

Earlier, we used the terms arbitrarily close, arbitrarily large, and sufficiently large to define limits at infinity informally.
Although these terms provide accurate descriptions of limits at infinity, they are not precise mathematically. Here are more
formal definitions of limits at infinity. We then look at how to use these definitions to prove results involving limits at
infinity.

Definition

(Formal) We say a function f has a limit at infinity, if there exists a real number L such that for all  > 0, there
exists N > 0 such that

                                            | f (x) - L| < 

for all x > N. In that case, we write

                                            x lim f (x) = L

(see Figure 4.48).

We say a function f has a limit at negative infinity if there exists a real number L such that for all  > 0, there
exists N < 0 such that

                                            | f (x) - L| < 

for all x < N. In that case, we write

                                         x  lim  f  (x)  =  L.

Earlier in this section, we used graphical evidence in Figure 4.40 and numerical evidence in Table 4.2 to conclude that

            1 =    2.  Here we use the formal definition of limit at infinity to prove this result rigorously.

We now turn our attention to a more precise definition for an infinite limit at infinity.

  Definition
  (Formal) We say a function f has an infinite limit at infinity and write

                                                             x lim f (x) = 
  if for all M > 0, there exists an N > 0 such that

                                                                 f (x) > M
  for all x > N (see Figure 4.49).
   We say a function has a negative infinite limit at infinity and write

                                                            x lim f (x) = -
  if for all M < 0, there exists an N > 0 such that

                                                                 f (x) < M

for all x > N.
Similarly we can define limits as x  -.

      Figure 4.49 For a function with an infinite limit at infinity, for
      all x > N, f (x) > M.

Earlier, we used graphical evidence (Figure  4.47) and numerical evidence (Table 4.3) to conclude that   lim x3 = .

                                                                                                        x

Here we use the formal definition of infinite limit at infinity to prove that result.

Example 4.23 An Infinite Limit at Infinity

Use the formal definition of infinite limit at infinity to prove that   lim x3 = .

                                                                       x

Solution
Let M > 0. Let N = 3 M. Then, for all x > N, we have

                                                        3 3 3 3
                                                  x > N =  M = M.

Therefore, lim x3 = .

End Behavior

The behavior of a function as x  ± is called the function's end behavior. At each of the function's ends, the function
could exhibit one of the following types of behavior:

    1. The function f (x) approaches a horizontal asymptote y = L.

    2. The function f (x)   or f (x)  -.

    3. The function does not approach a finite limit, nor does it approach  or -. In this case, the function may have
         some oscillatory behavior.

Let's consider several classes of functions here and look at the different types of end behaviors for these functions.
End Behavior for Polynomial Functions
Consider the power function f (x) = xn where n is a positive integer. From Figure 4.50 and Figure 4.51, we see that

                                                      lim xn = ; n = 1, 2, 3,...

                                                                  x

and
                                                  x lim-xn = ; n = 2, 4, 6,... -; n = 1, 3, 5,....

     Figure 4.50 For power functions with an even power of n,

     lim xn =  = lim xn.
     x  x  -

     Figure 4.51 For power functions with an odd power of n,

     lim xn =  and lim xn = -.
     x     x  -

Using these facts, it is not difficult to evaluate lim cxn and lim cxn,           where c is any constant and n is a positive
        x                 x  -

integer. If c > 0, the graph of y = cxn is a vertical stretch or compression of y = xn, and therefore

     lim cxn = lim xn and lim cxn = lim xn if c > 0.

If c < 0, the graph of y = cxn is a vertical stretch or compression combined with a reflection about the x -axis, and
therefore

     lim cxn = - lim xn and lim cxn = - lim xn if c < 0.
     x  x     x  -                                                                x  -

Example 4.24

Limits at Infinity for Power Functions

For each function  f,  evaluate             x lim f (x)     and    x   lim      f  (x).

                                                                        -

a. f (x) = -5x3

b. f (x) = 2x4

Solution

a. Since the coefficient of x3 is -5, the graph of f (x) = -5x3 involves a vertical stretch and reflection

of the graph of y = x3 about the x -axis. Therefore,                                     lim     3        and          3

                                                                                                -5x  = -       lim -5x  = .
                                                                                         x                     x  -

b. Since the coefficient of x4 is 2, the graph of f (x) = 2x4 is a vertical stretch of the graph of y = x4.

Therefore, lim 2x4 =  and lim 2x4 = .
                   x                                    x  -

4.23 Let f (x) = -3x4. Find lim f (x).

                                               x

We now look at how the limits at infinity for power functions can be used to determine lim f (x) for any polynomial

                                                                                                                                  x  ±

function f . Consider a polynomial function

                                                 f (x) = an xn + an - 1 xn - 1 + ... + a1 x + a0

of degree n  1 so that an  0. Factoring, we see that

                                         f  (x)  =  an  xn      +  an  -  1  1  +  ...   +  a1  1    a0 1 

                                                             1                                     + n.
                                                             an x                           an xn - 1 an x 

As x  ±, all the terms inside the parentheses approach zero except the first term. We conclude that

                                                            lim f (x) = lim an xn.

For example, the function f (x) = 5x3 - 3x2 + 4 behaves like g(x) = 5x3 as x  ± as shown in Figure 4.52 and
Table 4.4.

                       largest exponent.

End Behavior for Algebraic Functions
The end behavior for rational functions and functions involving radicals is a little more complicated than for polynomials. In
Example 4.25, we show that the limits at infinity of a rational function f (x) = p(x) q(x) depend on the relationship between
the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator. To evaluate the limits at infinity for a rational function,
we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of x appearing in the denominator. This determines which
term in the overall expression dominates the behavior of the function at large values of x.

   Example 4.25

     Determining End Behavior for Rational Functions

     For each of the following functions, determine the limits as x   and x  -. Then, use this information
     to describe the end behavior of the function.

         a. f (x) = 3x - 1 (Note: The degree of the numerator and the denominator are the same.)

b. f (x) = 3x2 + 2x (Note: The degree of numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.)
              4x3 - 5x + 7

c. f (x) = 3x2 + 4x (Note: The degree of numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator.)
                x+2

Solution

    a. The highest power of x in the denominator is x. Therefore, dividing the numerator and denominator by
         x and applying the algebraic limit laws, we see that

                                              lim 3x - 1       = lim 3 - 1/x

                                                               = x  ±

                                                                    lim (2 + 5/x)

                                                                  x  ±

                                                                    lim 3 - lim 1/x
                                                               = x  ± x  ±

                                                                    lim 2 + lim 5/x

                                                                  x  ± x  ±

                                                                  2+0 2

Since lim f (x) = 3, we know that y = 3 is a horizontal asymptote for this function as shown in22

the following graph.

                                         horizontal asymptote as x  ±.

b. Since the largest power of x appearing in the denominator is x3, divide the numerator and denominator
    by x3. After doing so and applying algebraic limit laws, we obtain

                 3x2 + 2x                                      3/x + 2/x2     3(0) + 2(0)
        lim                                           = lim                   3 = 4 - 5(0) + 7(0) = 0.
                                                               4 - 5/x + 7/x2

                                         4x - 5x + 7

Therefore f has a horizontal asymptote of y = 0 as shown in the following graph.
420                                                                             Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

            Figure 4.54 The graph of this rational function approaches
            the horizontal asymptote y = 0 as x  ±.

     c. Dividing the numerator and denominator by x, we have
                                                   lim 3x2 + 4x = lim 3x + 4 .

     As x  ±, the denominator approaches 1. As x  , the numerator approaches +. As

4.24 Evaluate x lim±3x5x22 + 2x - 1 - 4x + 7                         and use these limits to determine the end behavior of
 f (x) = 3x2 + 2x - 1 5x2 - 4x + 7.

 Before proceeding, consider the graph of f (x) = 3x2 + 4x shown in Figure 4.56. As x   and x  -, the
                                                             (x + 2)

graph of f appears almost linear. Although f is certainly not a linear function, we now investigate why the graph of f
seems to be approaching a linear function. First, using long division of polynomials, we can write

                                                       f (x) = 3x2 + 4x = 3x - 2 + 4 .
                                                                     x+2                       x+2

Since 4  0 as x  ±, we conclude that

Therefore, the graph of f approaches the line y = 3x - 2 as x  ±. This line is known as an oblique asymptote for
 f (Figure 4.56).

We can summarize the results of Example 4.25 to make the following conclusion regarding end behavior for rational
functions. Consider a rational function

                                     f (x) = p(x) an xn + a q(x) = m n - 1 xn - 1 + ... + a m - 1 1 x + a0 ,
                                                       bm x + bm - 1 x + ... + b1 x + b0

where an  0 and bm  0.
    1. If the degree of the numerator is the same as the degree of the denominator (n = m), then f has a horizontal
         asymptote of y = an /bm as x  ±.

    2. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator (n < m), then f has a horizontal
         asymptote of y = 0 as x  ±.

    3. If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator (n > m), then f does not have a
422                                                                                               Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     horizontal asymptote. The limits at infinity are either positive or negative infinity, depending on the signs of the
     leading terms. In addition, using long division, the function can be rewritten as

                                                      f (x) = p(x) = g(x) + r(x) ,
                                                      q(x)                                 q(x)

     where the degree of r(x) is less than the degree of q(x). As a result, lim r(x)/q(x) = 0. Therefore, the values

                                                                                                           x  ±

     of    f  (x)  -  g(x)  approach zero as  x  ±.   If the degree of            p(x)     is exactly one more than the degree of  q(x)
         

     (n = m + 1), the function g(x) is a linear function. In this case, we call g(x) an oblique asymptote.

     Now let's consider the end behavior for functions involving a radical.

     Example 4.26

     Determining End Behavior for a Function Involving a Radical

     Find the limits as x   and x  - for f (x) = 3x - 2 and describe the end behavior of f .
                                                                     4x2 + 5

     Solution
     Let's use the same strategy as we did for rational functions: divide the numerator and denominator by a power of
     x. To determine the appropriate power of x, consider the expression 4x2 + 5 in the denominator. Since

                                                         4x2 + 5  4x2 = 2|x|

     for large values of x in effect x appears just to the first power in the denominator. Therefore, we divide the
     numerator and denominator by |x|. Then, using the fact that |x| = x for x > 0, |x| = -x for x < 0, and

     |x| = x2 for all x, we calculate the limits as follows:

                             lim 3x - 2               = x lim 2 (1/|x|)(3x - 2)
                                                            (1/|x|) 4x + 5
                            x 2
                                              4x + 5

                                                      = lim (1/x)(3x - 2)

                                                           x    2 2 

                                                                   1/x 4x + 5

                                                      = lim 3 - 2/x = 3 = 3
                                                          x   4 + 5/x2 4 2

                              lim 3x - 2              = x lim- 2 (1/|x|)(3x - 2)
                                                                                  (1/|x|) 4x + 5
                            x  - 2
                                              4x + 5

                                                      = lim (-1/x)(3x - 2)

                                                           x  -  2 2 

                                                                    1/x 4x + 5

                                                      = lim -3 + 2/x = -3 = -3.

     Therefore, f (x) approaches the horizontal asymptote y = 3 as x   and the horizontal asymptote y = - 322

     as x  - as shown in the following graph.

The six basic trigonometric functions are periodic and do not approach a finite limit as x  ±. For example, sin x
oscillates between 1 and -1 (Figure 4.58). The tangent function x has an infinite number of vertical asymptotes as

To find the limit as x  , divide the numerator and denominator by ex :

                                                         x lim f (x)   =   lim  2 + 3ex
                                                                          x  7  -    5e x

Guidelines for Drawing the Graph of a Function

We now have enough analytical tools to draw graphs of a wide variety of algebraic and transcendental functions. Before
showing how to graph specific functions, let's look at a general strategy to use when graphing any function.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Drawing the Graph of a Function
Given a function f , use the following steps to sketch a graph of f :

1. Determine the domain of the function.
2. Locate the x - and y -intercepts.

3.  Evaluate   x lim f (x)               and  x  lim  f  (x)  to determine the end behavior. If either of these limits is a finite number

                                                  -

    L, then y = L is a horizontal asymptote. If either of these limits is  or -, determine whether f has

    an oblique asymptote. If f is a rational function such that f (x) = p(x) q(x) , where the degree of the numerator

    is greater than the degree of the denominator, then f can be written as

                                                              f (x) = p(x) = g(x) + r(x) ,
                                                                       q(x)           q(x)

    where the degree of r(x) is less than the degree of q(x). The values of f (x) approach the values of g(x) as
426                                                                                              Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

          x  ±. If g(x) is a linear function, it is known as an oblique asymptote.

     4. Determine whether f has any vertical asymptotes.

     5. Calculate f . Find all critical points and determine the intervals where f is increasing and where f is
         decreasing. Determine whether f has any local extrema.

     6. Calculate f . Determine the intervals where f is concave up and where f is concave down. Use this
         information to determine whether f has any inflection points. The second derivative can also be used as an
         alternate means to determine or verify that f has a local extremum at a critical point.

Now let's use this strategy to graph several different functions. We start by graphing a polynomial function.

   Example 4.28

     Sketching a Graph of a Polynomial

     Sketch a graph of f (x) = (x - 1)2 (x + 2).

     Solution
     Step 1. Since f is a polynomial, the domain is the set of all real numbers.

     Step 2. When x = 0, f (x) = 2. Therefore, the y -intercept is (0, 2). To find the x -intercepts, we need to solve
     the equation (x - 1)2 (x + 2) = 0, gives us the x -intercepts (1, 0) and (-2, 0)

     Step 3. We need to evaluate the end behavior of f . As x  , (x - 1)2   and (x + 2)  . Therefore,

     x lim f (x) = . As x  -,              (x - 1)2    and  (x + 2)  -.           Therefore,  x  lim  f  (x)  =  -.  To get

                                                                                                  -

     even more information about the end behavior of f , we can multiply the factors of f . When doing so, we see

     that

                                           f (x) = (x - 1)2 (x + 2) = x3 - 3x + 2.

     Since the leading term of f is x3, we conclude that f behaves like y = x3 as x  ±.

     Step 4. Since f is a polynomial function, it does not have any vertical asymptotes.

     Step 5. The first derivative of f is

                                                  f  (x) = 3x2 - 3.

     Therefore, f has two critical points: x = 1, -1. Divide the interval (-, ) into the three smaller intervals:
     (-, -1), (-1, 1), and (1, ). Then, choose test points x = -2, x = 0, and x = 2 from these
     intervals and evaluate the sign of f  (x) at each of these test points, as shown in the following table.

                                                                                              decreasing.

                                                                                              increasing.

From the table, we see that f has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at x = 1. Evaluating
 f (x) at those two points, we find that the local maximum value is f (-1) = 4 and the local minimum value is
 f (1) = 0.

Step 6. The second derivative of f is

                                                          f (x) = 6x.

The second derivative is zero at x = 0. Therefore, to determine the concavity of f , divide the interval
(-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, 0) and (0, ), and choose test points x = -1 and x = 1 to
determine the concavity of f on each of these smaller intervals as shown in the following table.

                   Interval Test Point Sign of f(x) = 6x Conclusion

We note that the information in the preceding table confirms the fact, found in step 5, that f has a local
maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at x = 1. In addition, the information found in step 5 --namely, f
has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at x = 1, and f  (x) = 0 at those points--combined
with the fact that f  changes sign only at x = 0 confirms the results found in step 6 on the concavity of f .

Combining this information, we arrive at the graph of f (x) = (x - 1)2 (x + 2) shown in the following graph.

     4.27 Sketch a graph of f (x) = (x - 1)3 (x + 2).

     Example 4.29

       Sketching a Rational Function

     Sketch the graph of f (x) =  x 2 2 .
                                     1 - x 

     Solution

     Step 1. The function f is defined as long as the denominator is not zero. Therefore, the domain is the set of all
     real numbers x except x = ±1.

     Step 2. Find the intercepts. If x = 0, then f (x) = 0, so 0 is an intercept. If y = 0,       then  x 2 2 = 0,
     which implies x = 0. Therefore, (0, 0) is the only intercept.                                      1 - x 

     Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since f is a rational function, divide the numerator and denominator by
     the highest power in the denominator: x2. We obtain

                                             lim x2 = lim 1                                = -1.
                  x  ±                       1-x  2 x  ± 1                           2 -1

                                                                                  x

     Therefore, f has a horizontal asymptote of y = -1 as x   and x  -.

     Step 4. To determine whether f has any vertical asymptotes, first check to see whether the denominator has any

     zeroes. We find the denominator is zero when x = ±1. To determine whether the lines x = 1 or x = -1 are

     vertical asymptotes of f , evaluate lim f (x) and lim f (x). By looking at each one-sided limit as x  1,
                  x1                              x  -1

                                         lim x 2 2 = - and lim- x 2 2 = .

In addition, by looking at each one-sided limit as x  -1, we find that

                                         lim x 2 2 =  and lim - x 2 2 = -.

Step 5. Calculate the first derivative:

                                                      -  x  2(2x)  -  x  2  (-2x)     2x .

                                         f  (x) =  1                               =

                                                             22                        22
                                                            1 - x                     1 - x 

Critical points occur at points x where f  (x) = 0 or f  (x) is undefined. We see that f  (x) = 0 when x = 0.

The derivative f  is not undefined at any point in the domain of f . However, x = ±1 are not in the domain of

f . Therefore, to determine where f is increasing and where f is decreasing, divide the interval (-, ) into

four smaller intervals: (-, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, ), and choose a test point in each interval to

determine the sign of f  (x) in each of these intervals. The values x = -2,                   x = - 1,   x = 1, and x = 2
are good choices for test points as shown in the following table.                                     2       2

                                                                                1 - x 

(-, -1) x = -2                                              -/ + = -                          f is decreasing.

(-1, 0)                                  x = -1/2           -/ + = -                          f is decreasing.

(0, 1)                                   x = 1/2            +/ + = +                          f is increasing.

(1, )                                    x=2                +/ + = +                          f is increasing.

From this analysis, we conclude that f has a local minimum at x = 0 but no local maximum.
Step 6. Calculate the second derivative:

                               2         2
                           21 - x  + 8x
                           =  23

                               23

                              1 - x 

     To determine the intervals where f is concave up and where f is concave down, we first need to find all points

     x where f (x) = 0 or f (x) is undefined. Since the numerator 6x2 + 2  0 for any x, f (x) is never zero.
     Furthermore, f  is not undefined for any x in the domain of f . However, as discussed earlier, x = ±1 are
     not in the domain of f . Therefore, to determine the concavity of f , we divide the interval (-, ) into the
     three smaller intervals (-, -1), (-1, -1), and (1, ), and choose a test point in each of these intervals
     to evaluate the sign of f (x). in each of these intervals. The values x = -2, x = 0, and x = 2 are possible
     test points as shown in the following table.

                                                                                     1 - x 

     (-, -1) x = -2            +/ - = -                                                        f is concave down.

     Combining all this information, we arrive at the graph of f shown below. Note that, although f changes
     concavity at x = -1 and x = 1, there are no inflection points at either of these places because f is not
     continuous at x = -1 or x = 1.

Example 4.30

  Sketching a Rational Function with an Oblique Asymptote

Sketch the graph of f (x) = x2
                                (x - 1)

Solution
Step 1. The domain of f is the set of all real numbers x except x = 1.

Step 2. Find the intercepts. We can see that when x = 0, f (x) = 0, so (0, 0) is the only intercept.

Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the
denominator, f must have an oblique asymptote. To find the oblique asymptote, use long division of polynomials

to write

                                         f (x) = x2 = x + 1 + 1 .
                                                      x-1  x-1

Since 1/(x - 1)  0 as x  ±,              f (x) approaches the line y = x + 1 as x  ±. The line y = x + 1 is
an oblique asymptote for f .

Step 4. To check for vertical asymptotes, look at where the denominator is zero. Here the denominator is zero at
x = 1. Looking at both one-sided limits as x  1, we find

                                         lim x2 =  and lim- x2 = -.
                                         x  1+ x - 1       x1 x-1

Therefore, x = 1 is a vertical asymptote, and we have determined the behavior of f as x approaches 1 from
the right and the left.

     Step 5. Calculate the first derivative:

                        f  (x) =                   (x - 1)(2x) - x2 (1) x2 - 2x            =               2.
                                                                     2
                                                          (x - 1)                              (x - 1)

     We have f  (x) = 0 when x2 - 2x = x(x - 2) = 0. Therefore, x = 0 and x = 2 are critical points. Since f

     is undefined at x = 1, we need to divide the interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, 0), (0, 1),
     (1, 2), and (2, ), and choose a test point from each interval to evaluate the sign of f  (x) in each of these

     smaller intervals. For example, let x = -1,      x = 1,         x = 3, and x = 3 be the test points as shown in the
     following table.                                      2              2

                                                                   (x - 1)2 (x - 1)2

     (-, 0) x = -1                             (-)(-)/ + = +                                                          f is increasing.

     (0, 1)    x = 1/2                         (+)(-)/ + = -                                                          f is decreasing.

     (1, 2)    x = 3/2                         (+)(-)/ + = -                                                          f is decreasing.

     (2, )     x=3                             (+)(+)/ + = +                                                          f is increasing.

     From this table, we see that f has a local maximum at x = 0 and a local minimum at x = 2. The value of f
     at the local maximum is f (0) = 0 and the value of f at the local minimum is f (2) = 4. Therefore, (0, 0) and
     (2, 4) are important points on the graph.

     Step 6. Calculate the second derivative:

                                               (x  -  1)  2  (2x  -  2)           -     2   -              -        

                    f (x)                                                            x         2x2(x           1)
                                              = (x - 1)4

                                               (x  -          -   1)(2x           -     2)  -        2  -      

                                                      1)(x                                     2x          2x
                                              = (x - 1)4

                                               (x  -  1)(2x   -     2)  -               2   -      

                                              = (x - 1)3                          2x           2x

                                               2x  2  -  4x   +  2  -                2  -       

                                                                        2x                  4x
                                              = (x - 1)3

                                              = (x - 1) 2 3.

     We see that f (x) is never zero or undefined for x in the domain of f . Since f is undefined at x = 1, to
     check concavity we just divide the interval (-, ) into the two smaller intervals (-, 1) and (1, ), and
     choose a test point from each interval to evaluate the sign of f (x) in each of these intervals. The values x = 0

  Sketching the Graph of a Function with a Cusp

Sketch a graph of f (x) = (x - 1)2/3.

Solution

                                                                                                     2/3 3 2  the domain
Step 1. Since the cube-root function is defined for all real numbers x and (x - 1) =  x - 1 ,
of f is all real numbers.

Step 2: To find the y -intercept, evaluate f (0). Since f (0) = 1, the y -intercept is (0, 1). To find the x
-intercept, solve (x - 1)2/3 = 0. The solution of this equation is x = 1, so the x -intercept is (1, 0).

     Step 3: Since lim (x - 1)2/3 = , the function continues to grow without bound as x   and x  -.

                         x  ±

     Step 4: The function has no vertical asymptotes.
     Step 5: To determine where f is increasing or decreasing, calculate f . We find

                                        f  (x) = 2(x - 1)-1/3 = 2 .
                                        3                                         3(x - 1)1/3

     This function is not zero anywhere, but it is undefined when x = 1. Therefore, the only critical point is x = 1.
     Divide the interval (-, ) into the smaller intervals (-, 1) and (1, ), and choose test points in each
     of these intervals to determine the sign of f  (x) in each of these smaller intervals. Let x = 0 and x = 2 be the

     test points as shown in the following table.

     Interval Test Point Sign of f (x) = 3(x - 12 )1/3 Conclusion

     (-, 1) x = 0                       +/ - = -                                               f is decreasing.

     (1, )  x=2                         +/ + = +                                               f is increasing.

     We conclude that f has a local minimum at x = 1. Evaluating f at x = 1, we find that the value of f at the
     local minimum is zero. Note that f  (1) is undefined, so to determine the behavior of the function at this critical
     point, we need to examine lim f  (x). Looking at the one-sided limits, we have

                                            x1

            lim                         2 =  and lim- 2 = -.
            x  1+ 3(x - 1)1/3                     x  1 3(x - 1)1/3

     Therefore, f has a cusp at x = 1.

     Step 6: To determine concavity, we calculate the second derivative of f :

                                        f (x) = - 2(x - 1)-4/3 = -2 .

     We find that f (x) is defined for all x, but is undefined when x = 1. Therefore, divide the interval (-, )
     into the smaller intervals (-, 1) and (1, ), and choose test points to evaluate the sign of f (x) in each of
     these intervals. As we did earlier, let x = 0 and x = 2 be test points as shown in the following table.

     Interval Test Point Sign of f(x) = 9(x - 1 -2)4/3 Conclusion

     (-, 1) x = 0                       -/ + = -                                               f is concave down.

     (1, )  x=2                         -/ + = -                                               f is concave down.

From this table, we conclude that f is concave down everywhere. Combining all of this information, we arrive

4.7 | Applied Optimization Problems

                                    Learning Objectives

         4.7.1 Set up and solve optimization problems in several applied fields.

One common application of calculus is calculating the minimum or maximum value of a function. For example, companies
often want to minimize production costs or maximize revenue. In manufacturing, it is often desirable to minimize the
amount of material used to package a product with a certain volume. In this section, we show how to set up these types of
minimization and maximization problems and solve them by using the tools developed in this chapter.

Solving Optimization Problems over a Closed, Bounded Interval

The basic idea of the optimization problems that follow is the same. We have a particular quantity that we are interested
in maximizing or minimizing. However, we also have some auxiliary condition that needs to be satisfied. For example, in
Example 4.32, we are interested in maximizing the area of a rectangular garden. Certainly, if we keep making the side
lengths of the garden larger, the area will continue to become larger. However, what if we have some restriction on how
much fencing we can use for the perimeter? In this case, we cannot make the garden as large as we like. Let's look at how
we can maximize the area of a rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.

   Example 4.32

     Maximizing the Area of a Garden

      A rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of the garden and wire fencing for the
     other three sides (Figure 4.62). Given 100 ft of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a
      garden of maximum area. What is the maximum area?

                             Figure 4.62 We want to determine the measurements x and
                              y that will create a garden with a maximum area using 100 ft
                                of fencing.

Solution
Let x denote the length of the side of the garden perpendicular to the rock wall and y denote the length of the
side parallel to the rock wall. Then the area of the garden is

                                                           A = x · y.
440                                                                                     Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     We want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that the total fencing is 100 ft. From Figure
     4.62, the total amount of fencing used will be 2x + y. Therefore, the constraint equation is

                                                         2x + y = 100.

     Solving this equation for y, we have y = 100 - 2x. Thus, we can write the area as

                                      A(x) = x · (100 - 2x) = 100x - 2x2.

     Before trying to maximize the area function A(x) = 100x - 2x2, we need to determine the domain under

     consideration. To construct a rectangular garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive.

     Therefore, we need x > 0 and y > 0. Since y = 100 - 2x, if y > 0, then x < 50. Therefore, we are trying

     to determine the maximum value of A(x) for x over the open interval (0, 50). We do not know that a function

     necessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do know that a continuous function has

     an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let's consider the function

     A(x) = 100x - 2x2  over the closed interval  0, 50.       If the maximum value occurs at an interior point, then

     we have found the value x in the open interval (0, 50) that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we

     consider the following problem:

     Maximize  A(x) = 100x - 2x2      over the interval            

                                                         0,  50.

     As mentioned earlier, since A is a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, by the extreme value
     theorem, it has a maximum and a minimum. These extreme values occur either at endpoints or critical points. At
     the endpoints, A(x) = 0. Since the area is positive for all x in the open interval (0, 50), the maximum must

     occur at a critical point. Differentiating the function A(x), we obtain

                                                           A (x) = 100 - 4x.

     Therefore, the only critical point is x = 25 (Figure 4.63). We conclude that the maximum area must occur when
     x = 25. Then we have y = 100 - 2x = 100 - 2(25) = 50. To maximize the area of the garden, let x = 25 ft
     and y = 50 ft. The area of this garden is 1250 ft2.

                                   Figure 4.63 To maximize the area of the garden, we need to find the
                                maximum value of the function A(x) = 100x - 2x2.

4.31 Determine the maximum area if we want to make the same rectangular garden as in Figure 4.63, but
we have 200 ft of fencing.

Now let's look at a general strategy for solving optimization problems similar to Example 4.32.

  Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Optimization Problems

       1. Introduce all variables. If applicable, draw a figure and label all variables.
       2. Determine which quantity is to be maximized or minimized, and for what range of values of the other variables

            (if this can be determined at this time).
       3. Write a formula for the quantity to be maximized or minimized in terms of the variables. This formula may

            involve more than one variable.
       4. Write any equations relating the independent variables in the formula from step 3. Use these equations to

            write the quantity to be maximized or minimized as a function of one variable.
       5. Identify the domain of consideration for the function in step 4 based on the physical problem to be solved.
       6. Locate the maximum or minimum value of the function from step 4. This step typically involves looking for

            critical points and evaluating a function at endpoints.

Now let's apply this strategy to maximize the volume of an open-top box given a constraint on the amount of material to be
used.

   Example 4.33

     Maximizing the Volume of a Box

     An open-top box is to be made from a 24 in. by 36 in. piece of cardboard by removing a square from each
      corner of the box and folding up the flaps on each side. What size square should be cut out of each corner to get
      a box with the maximum volume?

     Solution
     Step 1: Let x be the side length of the square to be removed from each corner (Figure 4.64). Then, the
     remaining four flaps can be folded up to form an open-top box. Let V be the volume of the resulting box.
442                                                                                     Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     Figure 4.64 A square with side length x inches is removed from each
     corner of the piece of cardboard. The remaining flaps are folded to form an

     open-top box.

     Step 2: We are trying to maximize the volume of a box. Therefore, the problem is to maximize V.

     Step 3: As mentioned in step 2, are trying to maximize the volume of a box. The volume of a box is
     V = L · W · H, where L, W, and H are the length, width, and height, respectively.

     Step 4: From Figure 4.64, we see that the height of the box is x inches, the length is 36 - 2x inches, and the
     width is 24 - 2x inches. Therefore, the volume of the box is

                                      V(x) = (36 - 2x)(24 - 2x)x = 4x3 - 120x2 + 864x.

     Step 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let's examine Figure 4.64. Certainly, we need x > 0.
     Furthermore, the side length of the square cannot be greater than or equal to half the length of the shorter side, 24
     in.; otherwise, one of the flaps would be completely cut off. Therefore, we are trying to determine whether there
     is a maximum volume of the box for x over the open interval (0, 12). Since V is a continuous function over
     the closed interval [0, 12], we know V will have an absolute maximum over the closed interval. Therefore,
     we consider V over the closed interval [0, 12] and check whether the absolute maximum occurs at an interior
     point.

     Step 6: Since V(x) is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [0, 12], V must have an absolute
     maximum (and an absolute minimum). Since V(x) = 0 at the endpoints and V(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 12, the
     maximum must occur at a critical point. The derivative is

                                                    V (x) = 12x2 - 240x + 864.
     To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation

                                                       12x2 - 240x + 864 = 0.
     Dividing both sides of this equation by 12, the problem simplifies to solving the equation

                                                          x2 - 20x + 72 = 0.
     Using the quadratic formula, we find that the critical points are

     2x = 20± (-20)2 - 4(1)(72) = 20± 112 = 20±4 7 = 10±2 7.                      2  2

Since 10 + 2 7 is not in the domain of consideration, the only critical point we need to consider is 10 - 2 7.
Therefore, the volume is maximized if we let x = 10 - 2 7 in. The maximum volume is
V(10 - 2 7) = 640 + 448 7  1825 in.3 as shown in the following graph.

                Figure 4.65 Maximizing the volume of the box leads to finding the maximum value of a
                cubic polynomial.

   Watch a video (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_boxvolume) about optimizing the volume of a box.

    4.32 Suppose the dimensions of the cardboard in Example 4.33 are 20 in. by 30 in. Let x be the side length
    of each square and write the volume of the open-top box as a function of x. Determine the domain of
    consideration for x.

Example 4.34

  Minimizing Travel Time

  An island is 2 mi due north of its closest point along a straight shoreline. A visitor is staying at a cabin on the
  shore that is 6 mi west of that point. The visitor is planning to go from the cabin to the island. Suppose the
  visitor runs at a rate of 8 mph and swims at a rate of 3 mph. How far should the visitor run before swimming
  to minimize the time it takes to reach the island?
  Solution
  Step 1: Let x be the distance running and let y be the distance swimming (Figure 4.66). Let T be the time it
  takes to get from the cabin to the island.
444                                                                                                            Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     Figure 4.66 How can we choose x and y to minimize the travel time from
     the cabin to the island?

     Step 2: The problem is to minimize T.

     Step 3: To find the time spent traveling from the cabin to the island, add the time spent running and the time spent
     swimming. Since Distance = Rate × Time (D = R × T), the time spent running is

                                                              Drunning x
                                                Trunning = R                         = 8,
                                                              running

     and the time spent swimming is

                                             Tswimming = RDswimming swimming = 3y.

     Therefore, the total time spent traveling is
                                                               T = x + y.
                                                                     83

     Step 4: From Figure 4.66, the line segment of y miles forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs
     of length 2 mi and 6 - x mi. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, 22 + (6 - x)2 = y2, and we obtain
     y = (6 - x)2 + 4. Thus, the total time spent traveling is given by the function

                                                T(x) = x + (6 - x)2 + 4.8         3

     Step 5: From Figure  4.66, we see that  0    x     6.    Therefore,                      is the domain of consideration.

                                                                                     0,  6

     Step 6: Since T(x) is a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval, it has a maximum and a minimum.

     Let's begin by looking for any critical points of  T  over the interval                          The derivative is

                                                                                         0,      6.

                                                  2 -1/2
                          1 1 (6 - x) + 4                                                             (6 - x)
                          T (x) = 8 - 2 3 · 2(6 - x) = 8 - 3 (6 - x)2 + 4.                    1

                                                            1 = 6-x .

Therefore,

                                                  3 (6 - x)2 + 4 = 8(6 - x).                               (4.6)

Squaring both sides of this equation, we see that if x satisfies this equation, then x must satisfy

                                                            -  x)2  +      =  64(6  -  x)2,

                                                      9(6              4

which implies

                                                               55(6 - x)2 = 36.

We conclude that if x is a critical point, then x satisfies

                                                        (x - 6)2 = 36.
                                                                     55

Therefore, the possibilities for critical points are

                                                               x = 6± 6 .
                                                                         55

Since x = 6 + 6/ 55 is not in the domain, it is not a possibility for a critical point. On the other hand,

x = 6 - 6/ 55 is in the domain. Since we squared both sides of Equation 4.6 to arrive at the possible critical

points, it remains to verify that x = 6 - 6/ 55 satisfies Equation 4.6. Since x = 6 - 6/ 55 does satisfy that

equation, we conclude that x = 6 - 6/ 55 is a critical point, and it is the only one. To justify that the time is
minimized for this value of x, we just need to check the values of T(x) at the endpoints x = 0 and x = 6,

and compare them with the value of T(x) at the critical point x = 6 - 6/ 55. We find that T(0)  2.108 h

and  T(6)  1.417 h,  whereas             T     -  6/           1.368   h.  Therefore, we conclude that  T  has a local minimum at

                                            6         55

x  5.19 mi.

        4.33 Suppose the island is 1 mi from shore, and the distance from the cabin to the point on the shore closest
        to the island is 15 mi. Suppose a visitor swims at the rate of 2.5 mph and runs at a rate of 6 mph. Let x
        denote the distance the visitor will run before swimming, and find a function for the time it takes the visitor to
        get from the cabin to the island.

In business, companies are interested in maximizing revenue. In the following example, we consider a scenario in which a
company has collected data on how many cars it is able to lease, depending on the price it charges its customers to rent a
car. Let's use these data to determine the price the company should charge to maximize the amount of money it brings in.

   Example 4.35

     Maximizing Revenue

     Owners of a car rental company have determined that if they charge customers p dollars per day to rent a
     car, where 50  p  200, the number of cars n they rent per day can be modeled by the linear function
446                                                                                                  Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     n(p) = 1000 - 5p. If they charge $50 per day or less, they will rent all their cars. If they charge $200 per

     day or more, they will not rent any cars. Assuming the owners plan to charge customers between $50 per day and
     $200 per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?

     Solution
     Step 1: Let p be the price charged per car per day and let n be the number of cars rented per day. Let R be the
     revenue per day.

     Step 2: The problem is to maximize R.

     Step 3: The revenue (per day) is equal to the number of cars rented per day times the price charged per car per
     day--that is, R = n × p.

     Step 4: Since the number of cars rented per day is modeled by the linear function n(p) = 1000 - 5p, the
     revenue R can be represented by the function

                                  R( p)  =  n  ×  p  =  1000  -          =  -5 p 2  +  1000 p.

                                                                 5 p p

     Step 5: Since the owners plan to charge between $50 per car per day and $200 per car per day, the problem is

     to find the maximum revenue  R( p)  for   p  in the closed interval         200.

                                                                            50,

     Step 6: Since  R  is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval                    200,  it has an absolute

                                                                                                50,

     maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points.
     The derivative is R (p) = -10p + 1000. Therefore, the critical point is p = 100 When p = 100,

     R(100) = $50,000. When p = 50, R(p) = $37,500. When p = 200, R(p) = $0. Therefore, the absolute

     maximum occurs at p = $100. The car rental company should charge $100 per day per car to maximize

     revenue as shown in the following figure.

                                      Figure 4.67 To maximize revenue, a car rental company has to
                                      balance the price of a rental against the number of cars people
                                      will rent at that price.

        4.34 A car rental company charges its customers p dollars per day, where 60  p  150. It has found that
        the number of cars rented per day can be modeled by the linear function n(p) = 750 - 5p. How much should
        the company charge each customer to maximize revenue?

Maximizing the Area of an Inscribed Rectangle

A rectangle is to be inscribed in the ellipse
                                                         x2 + y2 = 1.
                                                          4

What should the dimensions of the rectangle be to maximize its area? What is the maximum area?

Solution
Step 1: For a rectangle to be inscribed in the ellipse, the sides of the rectangle must be parallel to the axes. Let L
be the length of the rectangle and W be its width. Let A be the area of the rectangle.

Figure 4.68 We want to maximize the area of a rectangle inscribed in an
ellipse.

Step 2: The problem is to maximize A.

Step 3: The area of the rectangle is A = LW.

Step 4: Let (x, y) be the corner of the rectangle that lies in the first quadrant, as shown in Figure 4.68. We can

write length L = 2x and width W = 2y. Since x2 + y2 = 1 and y > 0,  we have y =  1 - x2. Therefore,
                                                          4                           4

the area is

                                                         x2 2
                                     A = LW = (2x)2y = 4x 1 - = 2x 4 - x .

                                                                         4

Step 5: From Figure 4.68, we see that to inscribe a rectangle in the ellipse, the x -coordinate of the corner in
the first quadrant must satisfy 0 < x < 2. Therefore, the problem reduces to looking for the maximum value of
A(x) over the open interval (0, 2). Since A(x) will have an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over

the closed interval [0, 2], we consider A(x) = 2x 4 - x2 over the interval [0, 2]. If the absolute maximum
occurs at an interior point, then we have found an absolute maximum in the open interval.

Step 6: As mentioned earlier, A(x) is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [0, 2]. Therefore,
it has an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum). At the endpoints x = 0 and x = 2, A(x) = 0. For
0 < x < 2, A(x) > 0. Therefore, the maximum must occur at a critical point. Taking the derivative of A(x),
we obtain
448                                           Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     A(x)  = 2 4 - x2 + 2x · 1 2 4 - x2(-2x)
           = 2 4 - x2 - 2x2

           = 8 - 4x2.

     To find critical points, we need to find where A(x) = 0. We can see that if x is a solution of

                                                           8 - 4x2 = 0, (4.7)
                                                            4 - x2
     then x must satisfy

           8 - 4x2 = 0.

     Therefore, x2 = 2. Thus, x = ± 2 are the possible solutions of Equation 4.7. Since we are considering x
     over the interval [0, 2], x = 2 is a possibility for a critical point, but x = - 2 is not. Therefore, we check

     whether 2 is a solution of Equation 4.7. Since x = 2 is a solution of Equation 4.7, we conclude that 2
     is the only critical point of A(x) in the interval [0, 2]. Therefore, A(x) must have an absolute maximum at the

     critical point x = 2. To determine the dimensions of the rectangle, we need to find the length L and the width
     W. If x = 2 then

     y = 1 - ( 2)2 = 1 - 1 = 1 .4
                         22

     Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are L = 2x = 2 2 and W = 2y = 2 = 2. The area of this
                                                                                                       2

     rectangle is A = LW = (2 2)( 2) = 4.

Solving Optimization Problems when the Interval Is Not Closed or Is
Unbounded

In the previous examples, we considered functions on closed, bounded domains. Consequently, by the extreme value
theorem, we were guaranteed that the functions had absolute extrema. Let's now consider functions for which the domain
is neither closed nor bounded.
Many functions still have at least one absolute extrema, even if the domain is not closed or the domain is unbounded. For
example, the function f (x) = x2 + 4 over (-, ) has an absolute minimum of 4 at x = 0. Therefore, we can still
consider functions over unbounded domains or open intervals and determine whether they have any absolute extrema. In
the next example, we try to minimize a function over an unbounded domain. We will see that, although the domain of
consideration is (0, ), the function has an absolute minimum.
In the following example, we look at constructing a box of least surface area with a prescribed volume. It is not difficult to
show that for a closed-top box, by symmetry, among all boxes with a specified volume, a cube will have the smallest surface
area. Consequently, we consider the modified problem of determining which open-topped box with a specified volume has
the smallest surface area.

  Minimizing Surface Area

  A rectangular box with a square base, an open top, and a volume of 216 in.3 is to be constructed. What should
  the dimensions of the box be to minimize the surface area of the box? What is the minimum surface area?

  Solution
  Step 1: Draw a rectangular box and introduce the variable x to represent the length of each side of the square
  base; let y represent the height of the box. Let S denote the surface area of the open-top box.

                          Figure 4.69 We want to minimize the surface area of a
                          square-based box with a given volume.

Step 2: We need to minimize the surface area. Therefore, we need to minimize S.

Step 3: Since the box has an open top, we need only determine the area of the four vertical sides and the base.
The area of each of the four vertical sides is x · y. The area of the base is x2. Therefore, the surface area of the
box is

                                               S = 4xy + x2.

Step 4: Since the volume of this box is x2 y and the volume is given as 216 in.3, the constraint equation is

                                               x2 y = 216.

Solving the constraint equation for y,         we have y = 21x26. Therefore, we can write the surface area as a function
of x only:

                                               S(x) = 4x216 + x2.
                                                          x2 

Therefore,  S(x)  =  864  +              x 2.
                      x

Step 5: Since we are requiring that x2 y = 216, we cannot have x = 0. Therefore, we need x > 0. On the

other hand, x is allowed to have any positive value. Note that as x becomes large, the height of the box
y becomes correspondingly small so that x2 y = 216. Similarly, as x becomes small, the height of the box

becomes correspondingly large. We conclude that the domain is the open, unbounded interval (0, ). Note that,
unlike the previous examples, we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an absolute maximum or absolute
minimum over a closed, bounded interval. However, in the next step, we discover why this function must have an
absolute minimum over the interval (0, ).

Step 6: Note that as x  0+ , S(x)  . Also, as x  , S(x)  . Since S is a continuous function
450                                                                                   Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     that approaches infinity at the ends, it must have an absolute minimum at some x  (0, ). This minimum must
     occur at a critical point of S. The derivative is

                                        S (x) = - 864 + 2x.
                                                      x2

     Therefore, S (x) = 0 when 2x = 86x24. Solving this equation for x, we obtain x3 = 432, so

     x = 3 432 = 63 2. Since this is the only critical point of S, the absolute minimum must occur at x = 63 2

     (see Figure 4.70). When x = 63 2,  y = 216  3 2 = 33 2 in. Therefore, the dimensions of the box should be
                                             6 2

     x = 63 2 in. and y = 33 2 in. With these dimensions, the surface area is

                                        62

                                  Figure 4.70 We can use a graph to determine the dimensions
                                  of a box of given the volume and the minimum surface area.

     4.36 Consider the same open-top box, which is to have volume 216 in.3. Suppose the cost of the material for
     the base is 20 ¢ /in.2 and the cost of the material for the sides is 30 ¢ /in.2 and we are trying to minimize the
     cost of this box. Write the cost as a function of the side lengths of the base. (Let x be the side length of the base
     and y be the height of the box.)

                                  Learning Objectives

     4.8.1 Recognize when to apply L'Hôpital's rule.
     4.8.2 Identify indeterminate forms produced by quotients, products, subtractions, and powers,
     and apply L'Hôpital's rule in each case.
     4.8.3 Describe the relative growth rates of functions.

In this section, we examine a powerful tool for evaluating limits. This tool, known as L'Hôpital's rule, uses derivatives to
calculate limits. With this rule, we will be able to evaluate many limits we have not yet been able to determine. Instead of
relying on numerical evidence to conjecture that a limit exists, we will be able to show definitively that a limit exists and to
determine its exact value.

Applying L'Hôpital's Rule

L'Hôpital's rule can be used to evaluate limits involving the quotient of two functions. Consider

                                                  xlima g(x) f (x).

If xlima f (x) = L1 and xlimag(x) = L2  0, then

                                                  xlima g(x) f (x) = LL12.

However, what happens if  lim  f  (x)  =  0  and  xlimag(x) = 0 ?                 We call this one of the indeterminate forms, of type  00.

                          xa

This is considered an indeterminate form because we cannot determine the exact behavior of f (x) g(x) as x  a without

further analysis. We have seen examples of this earlier in the text. For example, consider

                                                       lim x2 - 4 and lim sin x.
                                                      x2 x-2 x0 x
For the first of these examples, we can evaluate the limit by factoring the numerator and writing

                          lim x2 - 4 = lim (x + 2)(x - 2) = lim (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4.
                          x2 x-2 x2 x-2                                           x2

For  lim  sin x  we were able to show, using a geometric argument, that
     x0    x

                                                               lim sin x = 1.
                                                              x0 x

Here we use a different technique for evaluating limits such as these. Not only does this technique provide an easier way to
evaluate these limits, but also, and more important, it provides us with a way to evaluate many other limits that we could
not calculate previously.

The idea behind L'Hôpital's rule can be explained using local linear approximations. Consider two differentiable functions
 f and g such that xlima f (x) = 0 = xlimag(x) and such that g (a)  0 For x near a, we can write

                                                  f (x)  f (a) + f  (a)(x - a)

and

                                                  g(x)  g(a) + g (a)(x - a).

Therefore,

                                                  f (x) g(x)  f (a) + f  (a)(x - a) g(a) + g (a)(x - a) .

                         Figure 4.71 If xlima f (x) = xlimag(x), then the ratio f (x)/g(x) is
                         approximately equal to the ratio of their linear approximations near a.

Since  f  is differentiable at a,        then  f  is continuous at a,           and therefore                          f  (a)  =  lim  f  (x)  =  0.     Similarly,

                                                                                                                                  xa

g(a) = xlimag(x) = 0. If we also assume that           f  and g are continuous at x = a,                                  then    f    (a)  =  lim    f    (x)  and

                                                                                                                                               xa

g (a) = xlimag (x). Using these ideas, we conclude that

                                            xlima g(x) f (x) = xlima g (x)(x - a) f  (x)(x - a) = xlima g (x) f  (x).

Note that the assumption that f  and g are continuous at a and g (a)  0 can be loosened. We state L'Hôpital's rule

formally for the indeterminate form 0. Also note that the notation 0 does not mean we are actually dividing zero by zero.00

Rather, we are using the notation 0 to represent a quotient of limits, each of which is zero.
                                       0

Theorem 4.12: L'Hôpital's Rule (0/0 Case)

Suppose f and g are differentiable functions over an open interval containing a,                                               except possibly at a. If
xlima f (x) = 0 and xlimag(x) = 0, then

                                                    xlima g(x) f (x) = xlima g (x) f  (x),

assuming the limit on the right exists or is  or -. This result also holds if we are considering one-sided limits,
or if a =  and - .

Proof

We provide a proof of this theorem in the special case when f , g, f ,                         and g are all continuous                           over an open

         a. Since the numerator 1 - cos x  0 and the denominator x  0,
              evaluate this limit. We have

    Since the numerator and denominator of this new quotient both approach zero as x  0,         we apply
    L'Hôpital's rule again. In doing so, we see that

                                                          lim cos x - 1 = lim -sin x = 0.

We can also use L'Hôpital's rule to evaluate limits of quotients f (x) g(x) in which f (x)  ± and g(x)  ±. Limits of
this form are classified as indeterminate forms of type /. Again, note that we are not actually dividing  by .

     Example 4.39

       Applying L'Hôpital's Rule (/ Case)

     Evaluate each of the following limits by applying L'Hôpital's rule.
         a. lim 3x + 5
              x  2x + 1
         b. lim ln x
              x  0+ cot x

     Solution
         a. Since 3x + 5 and 2x + 1 are first-degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients,
              x lim(3x + 5) =  and x lim(2x + 1) = . Therefore, we apply L'Hôpital's rule and obtain

                                                        lim 3x + 5 = lim 3 = 3.

     Note that this limit can also be calculated without invoking L'Hôpital's rule. Earlier in the chapter we
     showed how to evaluate such a limit by dividing the numerator and denominator by the highest power of
     x in the denominator. In doing so, we saw that

                                             lim 3x + 5 = lim 3 + 5/x = 3.

     L'Hôpital's rule provides us with an alternative means of evaluating this type of limit.

     b. Here, lim ln x = - and lim cot x = . Therefore, we can apply L'Hôpital's rule and obtain
     x  0+                     x  0+

                                lim ln x = lim 1/x = lim 1 .
                               x  0+ cot x x  0+ -csc2 x x  0+ -x csc2 x

     Now as x  0+ , csc2 x  . Therefore, the first term in the denominator is approaching zero and
     the second term is getting really large. In such a case, anything can happen with the product. Therefore,
     we cannot make any conclusion yet. To evaluate the limit, we use the definition of csc x to write

                                               lim 1 = lim sin2 x.
                                             x  0+ -x csc2 x x  0+ -x

     Now lim sin2 x = 0 and lim x = 0, so we apply L'Hôpital's rule again. We find
     x  0+                     x  0+

                               lim sin2 x = lim 2 sin x cos x = 0 = 0.
                               x  0+ -x x  0+ -1                                  -1

     We conclude that

                                       lim ln x = 0.

As mentioned, L'Hôpital's rule is an extremely useful tool for evaluating limits. It is important to remember, however, that

to apply L'Hôpital's rule to a quotient f (x), it is essential that the limit of f (x) be of the form 0 or /. Consider
                                            g(x)                                     g(x)              0

the following example.

Example 4.40

When L'Hôpital's Rule Does Not Apply

Consider lim x2 + 5. Show that the limit cannot be evaluated by applying L'Hôpital's rule.
           x  13x + 4

Solution

Because the limits of the numerator and denominator are not both zero and are not both infinite, we cannot apply
L'Hôpital's rule. If we try to do so, we get

                                                         d   2  +      =  2x
                                                         dx
                                                             x     5

and

                                                        d (3x + 4) = 3.
                                                       dx
At which point we would conclude erroneously that

                                                  lim x2 + 5 = lim 2x = 2.

However, since  lim     2                6  and   lim (3x + 4) = 7,    we actually have
                x1                                x1
                        x + 5 =

                                                      lim x2 + 5 = 6.

We can conclude that

                                                                          d 2

means.

Other Indeterminate Forms

L'Hôpital's rule is very useful for evaluating limits involving the indeterminate forms 0 and /. However, we can
                                                                                                       0

also use L'Hôpital's rule to help evaluate limits involving other indeterminate forms that arise when evaluating limits. The
expressions 0 · ,  - , 1, 0, and 00 are all considered indeterminate forms. These expressions are not
real numbers. Rather, they represent forms that arise when trying to evaluate certain limits. Next we realize why these are
indeterminate forms and then understand how to use L'Hôpital's rule in these cases. The key idea is that we must rewrite
460                                                                                           Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

the indeterminate forms in such a way that we arrive at the indeterminate form 0 or /.
                                                                                           0

Indeterminate Form of Type 0 · 

Suppose we want to evaluate  lim     (x)  ·  g(x),  where  f (x)  0 and g(x)   (or -) as x  a. Since one term
                             xa
                                  f

in the product is approaching zero but the other term is becoming arbitrarily large (in magnitude), anything can happen to

the product. We use the notation 0 ·  to denote the form that arises in this situation. The expression 0 ·  is considered
indeterminate because we cannot determine without further analysis the exact behavior of the product f (x)g(x) as x  a.

For example, let n be a positive integer and consider

                                             f (x) = n1 and g(x) = 3x2.
                                                     (x + 1)

As x  , f (x)  0 and g(x)  . However, the limit as x   of f (x)g(x) = n                       3x2      varies, depending on n.
                                                                                              (x + 1)

If n = 2, then x lim f (x)g(x) = 3. If n = 1, then x lim f (x)g(x) = . If n = 3, then x lim f (x)g(x) = 0. Here we

consider another limit involving the indeterminate form 0 ·  and show how to rewrite the function as a quotient to use

L'Hôpital's rule.

     Example 4.41

     Indeterminate Form of Type 0 · 

     Evaluate lim x ln x.

                   x  0+

     Solution
     First, rewrite the function x ln x as a quotient to apply L'Hôpital's rule. If we write

                                                         x ln x = ln x,
                                                                  1/x

     we see that   ln x  -   as  x  0+       and    1      as  x  0+ .            Therefore, we can apply L'Hôpital's rule and
                                                    x

     obtain

                                                    d (ln x)
                            lim ln x = lim dx = lim 1/x = lim (-x) = 0.
                           x  0+ 1/x x  0+ d (1/x) x  0+ -1/x2 x  0+

                                                          dx

     We conclude that

                                                        lim x ln x = 0.

                         x0

Indeterminate Form of Type  - 

Another type of indeterminate form is  - . Consider the following example. Let n be a positive integer and let

f (x) = 3xn and g(x) = 3x2 + 5. As x  ,                    f (x)   and g(x)  . We are interested in  lim    f  (x)  -  g(x).
                                                                                                     x    

Depending on whether f (x) grows faster, g(x) grows faster, or they grow at the same rate, as we see next, anything can

happen in this limit. Since f (x)   and g(x)  , we write  -  to denote the form of this limit. As with our

other indeterminate forms,  -  has no meaning on its own and we must do more analysis to determine the value of the
limit. For example, suppose the exponent n in the function f (x) = 3xn is n = 3, then

                                         lim    f  (x)  -  g(x)  =  lim  3   -  3x2  -      =  .
                                         x                          x
                                                                         3x             5

On the other hand, if n = 2,  then

                                         lim    f  (x)  -  g(x)  =  lim  2   -  3x2  -      =  -5.
                                         x                          x
                                                                         3x             5

However, if n = 1, then

                                         lim    f  (x)  -  g(x)  =  lim      -  3x2  -      =  -.
                                         x                          x
                                                                         3x             5

Therefore, the limit cannot be determined by considering only  - . Next we see how to rewrite an expression involving
the indeterminate form  -  as a fraction to apply L'Hôpital's rule.

Example 4.42

462                                                                                                                          Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

     Evaluate       lim  1 -   1  
               x  0+ x2 tan x
                                   .

     Solution

     By combining the fractions, we can write the function as a quotient. Since the least common denominator is
     x2 tan x, we have

                                                1 1 (tan x) - x2
                                                   2 - tan x = 2                             .
                                                x                                 x tan x

     As x  0+ , the numerator tan x - x2  0 and the denominator x2 tan x  0. Therefore, we can apply
     L'Hôpital's rule. Taking the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator, we have

                                           (tan x) - x2                              2                          .

                                                                                    sec x - 2x
                                      lim+ 2                  = lim+ 2 2
                                      x  0 x tan x x  0 x sec x + 2x tan x

     As x  0+ ,        2       -  2x    1  and  x2 sec2 x + 2x tan x  0.                     Since the denominator is positive as  x

                       sec  x

     approaches zero from the right, we conclude that

                                                             2

                                                            sec x - 2x
                                                lim+ 2 2                                   = .
                                           x  0 x sec x + 2x tan x

     Therefore,

                                                 lim  1 - 1  = .
                                                x  0+ x2 tan x

       4.41 Evaluate lim 1 - 1 .
                           x  0+ x sin x

Another type of indeterminate form that arises when evaluating limits involves exponents. The expressions 00, 0, and
1 are all indeterminate forms. On their own, these expressions are meaningless because we cannot actually evaluate these
expressions as we would evaluate an expression involving real numbers. Rather, these expressions represent forms that arise
when finding limits. Now we examine how L'Hôpital's rule can be used to evaluate limits involving these indeterminate
forms.

Since L'Hôpital's rule applies to quotients, we use the natural logarithm function and its properties to reduce a problem
evaluating a limit involving exponents to a related problem involving a limit of a quotient. For example, suppose we want

to evaluate xlima f (x)g(x) and we arrive at the indeterminate form 0. (The indeterminate forms 00 and 1 can be
handled similarly.) We proceed as follows. Let

                                                            y = f (x)g(x).

Then,

                                                        g(x)                                      
                                           ln y = lnf (x)  = g(x)ln f (x).

Therefore,

                                           lim     ln(y)      =  lim              g(x)ln f (x). 

                                           xa                    xa

Since  lim  f  (x)  =  ,  we know that     lim         (x)  =  .  Therefore,                    lim  g(  x  )l       f  (x)  is of the indeterminate form

Solution
Let y = x1/x. Then,

                                               1/x        =  1  ln x  =  ln x.

                                            lnx 

We need to evaluate   lim ln x.          Applying L'Hôpital's rule, we obtain
                     x x

                                         lim ln y =  lim ln x =          lim 1/x = 0.
                                                            x          x 1
                                         x           x

Therefore, x limln y = 0. Since the natural logarithm function is continuous, we conclude that

                                            lnx limy = 0,       

which leads to

                                            lim y =       lim   ln x = e0 = 1.

Hence,

     Evaluate lim xsin x.

                   x  0+

     Solution
     Let

                                                                   y = xsin x.

     Therefore,

                                                      ln  y  =     sin  x  =      sin  x  ln  x.

     We now evaluate lim sin x ln x. Since lim sin x = 0 and lim ln x = -, we have the indeterminate
                 x  0+                                x  0+                            x  0+

     form 0 · . To apply L'Hôpital's rule, we need to rewrite sin x ln x as a fraction. We could write

                                                             sin x ln x = sin x
                                                                          1/ln x

     or

                                                      sin x ln x = ln x = ln x .
                                                                   1/sin x csc x

     Let's consider the first option. In this case, applying L'Hôpital's rule, we would obtain

                 lim sin x ln x = lim sin x = lim                                 cos x      2    =  lim       x  (ln  x  )  2  cos  x  
                                         x  0+ 1/ln x                     -1/x(ln
                 x  0+                                          x     0+                  x)         x  0+  -                           .

     Unfortunately, we not only have another expression involving the indeterminate form 0 · , but the new limit

     is even more complicated to evaluate than the one with which we started. Instead, we try the second option. By
     writing

                                                     sin x ln x = ln x = ln x ,
                                                                   1/sin x csc x

     and applying L'Hôpital's rule, we obtain

                 lim sin x ln x =             lim ln x =              lim         1/x = lim                       -1 .
                                                    csc x           x  0+ -csc x cot x x  0+ x csc x cot x
                 x  0+                        x  0+

     Using the fact that csc x = 1 and cot x = cos x, we can rewrite the expression on the right-hand side as
                           sin x                             sin x

                 lim -sin2 x =           lim  sin  x  ·  (-tan      =      lim    sin x·             lim  (-tan x) = 1 · 0 = 0.
                                                                       x  0+ x  x  0+
                                                                x)
                 x  0+ x cos x x  0+ x

     We conclude that lim ln y = 0. Therefore, ln lim y = 0 and we have
                 x  0+                                          x  0+ 

                                               lim y = lim xsin x = e0 = 1.

                                              x  0+ x  0+

     Hence,

                                                              lim xsin x = 1.

Growth Rates of Functions

Suppose the functions f and g both approach infinity as x  . Although the values of both functions become
arbitrarily large as the values of x become sufficiently large, sometimes one function is growing more quickly than the
other. For example, f (x) = x2 and g(x) = x3 both approach infinity as x  . However, as shown in the following
table, the values of x3 are growing much faster than the values of x2.

          x                                    10             100           1000                   10,000

          g(x) = x3 1000 1,000,000 1,000,000,000 1,000,000,000,000

          Table 4.7 Comparing the Growth Rates of x2 and x3

In fact,

              lim                        x3    =    lim x  =  .   or,  equivalently,   lim  x2 3 = x lim x = 0.1
                                            2
             x                           x         x                                  x     x

As a result, we say x3 is growing more rapidly than x2 as x  . On the other hand, for f (x) = x2 and

g(x) = 3x2 + 4x + 1, although the values of g(x) are always greater than the values of f (x) for x > 0, each value of
g(x) is roughly three times the corresponding value of f (x) as x  , as shown in the following table. In fact,

                                                            lim        x2       = 3.  1

             f(x) = x2                                     100 10,000 1,000,000 100,000,000

                    Table 4.8 Comparing the Growth Rates of x2 and 3x2 + 4x + 1

In this case, we say that x2 and 3x2 + 4x + 1 are growing at the same rate as x  .
More generally, suppose f and g are two functions that approach infinity as x  . We say g grows more rapidly than
 f as x   if

                                        x lim g(x) f (x) = ; or, equivalently, x lim f (x) g(x) = 0.
On the other hand, if there exists a constant M  0 such that

                                                            x lim g(x) f (x) = M,
we say f and g grow at the same rate as x  .

         a. f (x) = x2 and g(x) = ex
         b. f (x) = ln(x) and g(x) = x2

     a. Since lim x2 =  and lim ex = ,                                                      x2
               x       x                we can use L'Hôpital's rule to evaluate x lim x. We

                                                                                                  e

     obtain

                                      lim  x2    =                                 lim     2x x.
                                           e  x                                            e

     Since lim 2x =  and lim ex = ,     we can apply L'Hôpital's rule again. Since
               x       x

                          lim           2x =                                      lim  2   =   0,

                                          x                                             x
                          x  e x  e

     we conclude that

                                        x lim xx2 = 0.
                                               e

     Therefore, ex grows more rapidly than x2 as x   (See Figure 4.73 and Table 4.9).

In many areas of pure and applied mathematics, we are interested in finding solutions to an equation of the form f (x) = 0.

For most functions, however, it is difficult--if not impossible--to calculate their zeroes explicitly. In this section, we take
a look at a technique that provides a very efficient way of approximating the zeroes of functions. This technique makes use
of tangent line approximations and is behind the method used often by calculators and computers to find zeroes.

Describing Newton's Method

Consider the task of finding the solutions of f (x) = 0. If f is the first-degree polynomial f (x) = ax + b, then the

solution of  f (x) = 0  is given by the formula  x=  -  b.  If  f                 is the second-degree polynomial  f (x) = ax2 + bx + c,
                                                        a

the solutions of f (x) = 0 can be found by using the quadratic formula. However, for polynomials of degree 3 or more,

finding roots of f becomes more complicated. Although formulas exist for third- and fourth-degree polynomials, they are

quite complicated. Also, if f is a polynomial of degree 5 or greater, it is known that no such formulas exist. For example,

consider the function

                          f (x) = x5 + 8x4 + 4x3 - 2x - 7.

No formula exists that allows us to find the solutions of f (x) = 0. Similar difficulties exist for nonpolynomial functions.
For example, consider the task of finding solutions of tan(x) - x = 0. No simple formula exists for the solutions of this
equation. In cases such as these, we can use Newton's method to approximate the roots.

Newton's method makes use of the following idea to approximate the solutions of f (x) = 0. By sketching a graph of

f , we can estimate a root of f (x) = 0. Let's call this estimate x0. We then draw the tangent line to f at x0. If

f  (x0)  0,  this tangent line intersects the  x -axis at some point                        Now let  x1  be the next approximation to the

                                                                                  x 1,  0.

actual root. Typically, x1 is closer than x0 to an actual root. Next we draw the tangent line to f at x1. If f  (x1)  0,

this tangent line also intersects the x -axis, producing another approximation, x2. We continue in this way, deriving a list

of approximations: x0, x1, x2 ,.... Typically, the numbers x0, x1, x2 ,... quickly approach an actual root x * , as shown

in the following figure.

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives                                                                                              473

    Figure 4.77 The approximations x0, x1, x2 ,... approach the actual root x * . The
    approximations are derived by looking at tangent lines to the graph of f .

Now let's look at how to calculate the approximations x0, x1, x2 ,.... If x0 is our first approximation, the approximation

x1  is defined by letting  x1, 0         be the  x -intercept of the tangent line to  f  at  x 0.  The equation of this tangent line is given

by

                                                 y = f (x0) + f  (x0)(x - x0).

Therefore, x1 must satisfy

                                                 f (x0) + f  (x0)(x1 - x0) = 0.

Solving this equation for x1, we conclude that

                                                 x1 = x0 - f (x0) .
                                                              f (x0)

Similarly, the point  x2, 0 is the       x -intercept of the tangent line to  f  at   x 1.   Therefore,  x2  satisfies the equation

                                                 x2 = x1 - f (x1) .
                                                              f (x1)

In general, for n > 0, xn satisfies

                                                 xn = xn - 1 - f (xn - 1) .                                                          (4.8)
                                                                  f (xn - 1)

Next we see how to make use of this technique to approximate the root of the polynomial f (x) = x3 - 3x + 1.

     Use Newton's method to approximate a root of f (x) = x3 - 3x + 1 in the interval [1, 2]. Let x0 = 2 and find
     x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5.

     Solution

     From Figure 4.78, we see that f has one root over the interval (1, 2). Therefore x0 = 2 seems like
     a reasonable first approximation. To find the next approximation, we use Equation 4.8. Since
      f (x) = x3 - 3x + 1, the derivative is f  (x) = 3x2 - 3. Using Equation 4.8 with n = 1 (and a calculator
     that displays 10 digits), we obtain

     x1 = x0 - f (x0) = 2 - f (2) = 2 - 3  1.666666667.
     f (x0)                            f (2)  9

     To find the next approximation, x2, we use Equation 4.8 with n = 2 and the value of x1 stored on the
     calculator. We find that

                                                 x2 = x1 = f (x1)  1.548611111.
                                                               f (x1)

     Continuing in this way, we obtain the following results:

                                                          x1  1.666666667
                                                          x2  1.548611111
                                                          x3  1.532390162
                                                          x4  1.532088989
                                                          x5  1.532088886

     We note that we obtained the same value for x5 and x6. Therefore, any subsequent application of Newton's
     method will most likely give the same value for xn.

4.45 Letting x0 = 0, let's use Newton's method to approximate the root of f (x) = x3 - 3x + 1 over the
interval [0, 1] by calculating x1 and x2.

Newton's method can also be used to approximate square roots. Here we show how to approximate 2. This method can
be modified to approximate the square root of any positive number.

   Example 4.47

     Finding a Square Root

Use Newton's method to approximate 2 (Figure 4.79). Let f (x) = x2 - 2, let x0 = 2, and calculate
x1, x2, x3, x4, x5. (We note that since f (x) = x2 - 2 has a zero at 2, the initial value x0 = 2 is a
reasonable choice to approximate 2.)

Solution
For f (x) = x2 - 2, f  (x) = 2x. From Equation 4.8, we know that

                                                     xn = xn - 1 - f (xn - 1)
                                                                       f (xn - 1)

                                                                        x2 n - 1 - 2
                                                           = xn - 1 -

                                                                          2xn - 1

                                                           = 1xn - 1 + x 12
                                                                            n-1

                                                           = 1x + 2 .

Therefore,

                                         x1  =  21x  +  2    =  1 2  +  2   =   1.5

                                                         02 2

                                         x2  =  21x  +  2    =  11.5    +   2        1.416666667.

Continuing in this way, we find that

                                                           x1 = 1.5

Since we obtained the same value for x4 and x5, it is unlikely that the value xn will change on any subsequent
application of Newton's method. We conclude that 2  1.414213562.

When using Newton's method, each approximation after the initial guess is defined in terms of the previous approximation

                                                                                      f (x) 
by using the same formula. In particular, by defining the function F(x) = x -  , we can rewrite Equation 4.8 as

                                                                                             f  (x)
xn = F(xn - 1). This type of process, where each xn is defined in terms of xn - 1 by repeating the same function, is an
example of an iterative process. Shortly, we examine other iterative processes. First, let's look at the reasons why Newton's
method could fail to find a root.

Failures of Newton's Method

Typically, Newton's method is used to find roots fairly quickly. However, things can go wrong. Some reasons why Newton's
method might fail include the following:

    1. At one of the approximations xn, the derivative f  is zero at xn, but f (xn)  0. As a result, the tangent line of
          f at xn does not intersect the x -axis. Therefore, we cannot continue the iterative process.

    2. The approximations x0, x1, x2 ,... may approach a different root. If the function f has more than one root, it is
         possible that our approximations do not approach the one for which we are looking, but approach a different root
         (see Figure 4.80). This event most often occurs when we do not choose the approximation x0 close enough to the
         desired root.

    3. The approximations may fail to approach a root entirely. In Example 4.48, we provide an example of a function
         and an initial guess x0 such that the successive approximations never approach a root because the successive
         approximations continue to alternate back and forth between two values.

                   Figure 4.80 If the initial guess x0 is too far from the root sought, it may lead
                   to approximations that approach a different root.

Example 4.48

  When Newton's Method Fails

Consider the function f (x) = x3 - 2x + 2. Let x0 = 0. Show that the sequence x1, x2 ,... fails to approach a
root of f .

Solution
For f (x) = x3 - 2x + 2, the derivative is f  (x) = 3x2 - 2. Therefore,

                                         x1 = x0 - f (x0) = 0 - f (0) = - 2 = 1.
                                         f  (x0)  f  (0)  -2

In the next step,

                                         x2 = x1 - f (x1) = 1 - f (1) = 1 - 1 = 0.
                                         f (x1)   f  (1)  1

Consequently, the numbers x0, x1, x2 ,... continue to bounce back and forth between 0 and 1 and never get
closer to the root of f which is over the interval [-2, -1] (see Figure 4.81). Fortunately, if we choose an

initial approximation x0 closer to the actual root, we can avoid this situation.
478  Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

                                       Figure 4.81 The approximations continue to alternate
                                   between 0 and 1 and never approach the root of f .

        4.47 For f (x) = x3 - 2x + 2, let x0 = -1.5 and find x1 and x2.

From Example 4.48, we see that Newton's method does not always work. However, when it does work, the sequence of
approximations approaches the root very quickly. Discussions of how quickly the sequence of approximations approach a
root found using Newton's method are included in texts on numerical analysis.

Other Iterative Processes

As mentioned earlier, Newton's method is a type of iterative process. We now look at an example of a different type of
iterative process.
Consider a function F and an initial number x0. Define the subsequent numbers xn by the formula xn = F(xn - 1). This
process is an iterative process that creates a list of numbers x0, x1, x2 ,..., xn ,.... This list of numbers may approach a
finite number x * as n gets larger, or it may not. In Example 4.49, we see an example of a function F and an initial
guess x0 such that the resulting list of numbers approaches a finite value.

   Example 4.49

     Finding a Limit for an Iterative Process

     Let F(x) = 1x + 4 and let x0 = 0. For all n  1, let xn = F(xn - 1). Find the values x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.
                    2

     Make a conjecture about what happens to this list of numbers x1, x2, x3 ..., xn ,... as n  . If the list of
     numbers x1, x2, x3 ,... approaches a finite number x * , then x * satisfies x * = F(x * ), and x * is called
     a fixed point of F.

                                               2

                                               2

                                         x8 = 1(7.9375) + 4 = 7.96875
                                               2

                                         x9 = 1(7.96875) + 4 = 7.984375.
                                               2

From this list, we conjecture that the values xn approach 8.

Figure 4.82 provides a graphical argument that the values approach 8 as n  . Starting at the point

(x0, x0),  we draw a vertical line to the point        F (x 0).  The next number in our list is  x1 = F(x0).   We use

                                                 x 0,

x1 to calculate x2. Therefore, we draw a horizontal line connecting (x0, x1) to the point (x1, x1) on the line

y = x,  and then draw a vertical line connecting  (x1,  x 1)  to the point        F (x 1).  The output  F(x1)  becomes

                                                                            x 1,

x2. Continuing in this way, we could create an infinite number of line segments. These line segments are trapped

between the lines F(x) = x + 4 and y = x. The line segments get closer to the intersection point of these two
                              2

lines, which occurs when x = F(x). Solving the equation x = x + 4, we conclude they intersect at x = 8.
                                                                           2

Therefore, our graphical evidence agrees with our numerical evidence that the list of numbers x0, x1, x2 ,...

approaches x * = 8 as n  .

           x * = 8.

Iterative Processes and Chaos

Iterative processes can yield some very interesting behavior. In this section, we have seen several examples of iterative
processes that converge to a fixed point. We also saw in Example 4.48 that the iterative process bounced back and
forth between two values. We call this kind of behavior a 2 -cycle. Iterative processes can converge to cycles with
various periodicities, such as 2 - cycles, 4 - cycles (where the iterative process repeats a sequence of four values),
8-cycles, and so on.

Some iterative processes yield what mathematicians call chaos. In this case, the iterative process jumps from value to
value in a seemingly random fashion and never converges or settles into a cycle. Although a complete exploration of
chaos is beyond the scope of this text, in this project we look at one of the key properties of a chaotic iterative process:
sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This property refers to the concept that small changes in initial conditions
can generate drastically different behavior in the iterative process.

Probably the best-known example of chaos is the Mandelbrot set (see Figure 4.83), named after Benoit Mandelbrot
(1924-2010), who investigated its properties and helped popularize the field of chaos theory. The Mandelbrot set is
usually generated by computer and shows fascinating details on enlargement, including self-replication of the set.
Several colorized versions of the set have been shown in museums and can be found online and in popular books on
the subject.

                Figure 4.83 The Mandelbrot set is a well-known example of a set of points generated by the
                iterative chaotic behavior of a relatively simple function.

In this project we use the logistic map
                                         f (x) = rx(1 - x), where x  [0, 1] and r > 0

as the function in our iterative process. The logistic map is a deceptively simple function; but, depending on the value
of r, the resulting iterative process displays some very interesting behavior. It can lead to fixed points, cycles, and
even chaos.
482                                                                              Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

To visualize the long-term behavior of the iterative process associated with the logistic map, we will use a tool called a

cobweb diagram. As we did with the iterative process we examined earlier in this section, we first draw a vertical line

from the point            to the point        f            =  (x0,   x1).  We then draw a horizontal line from that point to the point

                x 0,  0                 x 0,     (x 0)

(x1, x1),  then draw a vertical line to             f             =  (x1,  x2),  and continue the process until the long-term behavior

                                              x 1,     (x 1)

of the system becomes apparent. Figure 4.84 shows the long-term behavior of the logistic map when r = 3.55 and

     x0 = 0.2. (The first 100 iterations are not plotted.) The long-term behavior of this iterative process is an 8 -cycle.

                                   presented here. The sequence of values results in an 8 -cycle.
       1. Let r = 0.5 and choose x0 = 0.2. Either by hand or by using a computer, calculate the first 10 values in the
            sequence. Does the sequence appear to converge? If so, to what value? Does it result in a cycle? If so, what
           kind of cycle (for example, 2 - cycle, 4 - cycle.) ?
       2. What happens when r = 2 ?
       3. For r = 3.2 and r = 3.5, calculate the first 100 sequence values. Generate a cobweb diagram for each
            iterative process. (Several free applets are available online that generate cobweb diagrams for the logistic map.)
            What is the long-term behavior in each of these cases?
       4. Now let r = 4. Calculate the first 100 sequence values and generate a cobweb diagram. What is the long-
            term behavior in this case?
       5. Repeat the process for r = 4, but let x0 = 0.201. How does this behavior compare with the behavior for

4.10 | Antiderivatives

                                         Learning Objectives

4.10.1  Find the general antiderivative of a given function.
4.10.2  Explain the terms and notation used for an indefinite integral.
4.10.3  State the power rule for integrals.
4.10.4  Use antidifferentiation to solve simple initial-value problems.

At this point, we have seen how to calculate derivatives of many functions and have been introduced to a variety of their
applications. We now ask a question that turns this process around: Given a function f , how do we find a function with
the derivative f and why would we be interested in such a function?

We answer the first part of this question by defining antiderivatives. The antiderivative of a function f is a function with a
derivative f . Why are we interested in antiderivatives? The need for antiderivatives arises in many situations, and we look
at various examples throughout the remainder of the text. Here we examine one specific example that involves rectilinear
motion. In our examination in Derivatives of rectilinear motion, we showed that given a position function s(t) of an
object, then its velocity function v(t) is the derivative of s(t) --that is, v(t) = s (t). Furthermore, the acceleration a(t)
is the derivative of the velocity v(t) --that is, a(t) = v (t) = s(t). Now suppose we are given an acceleration function
a, but not the velocity function v or the position function s. Since a(t) = v (t), determining the velocity function
requires us to find an antiderivative of the acceleration function. Then, since v(t) = s (t), determining the position
function requires us to find an antiderivative of the velocity function. Rectilinear motion is just one case in which the
need for antiderivatives arises. We will see many more examples throughout the remainder of the text. For now, let's look
at the terminology and notation for antiderivatives, and determine the antiderivatives for several types of functions. We
examine various techniques for finding antiderivatives of more complicated functions later in the text (Introduction to
Techniques of Integration (http://cnx.org/content/m53654/latest/) ).

The Reverse of Differentiation

At this point, we know how to find derivatives of various functions. We now ask the opposite question. Given a function
 f , how can we find a function with derivative f ? If we can find a function F derivative f , we call F an antiderivative
of f .

Definition
A function F is an antiderivative of the function f if

                                         F (x) = f (x)

for all x in the domain of f .

Consider the function f (x) = 2x. Knowing the power rule of differentiation, we conclude that F(x) = x2 is an
antiderivative of f since F (x) = 2x. Are there any other antiderivatives of f ? Yes; since the derivative of any constant

C is zero, x2 + C is also an antiderivative of 2x. Therefore, x2 + 5 and x2 - 2 are also antiderivatives. Are there any
others that are not of the form x2 + C for some constant C ? The answer is no. From Corollary 2 of the Mean Value
Theorem, we know that if F and G are differentiable functions such that F (x) = G (x), then F(x) - G(x) = C for
some constant C. This fact leads to the following important theorem.
486                                                                                                 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

Theorem 4.14: General Form of an Antiderivative
Let F be an antiderivative of f over an interval I. Then,

     i. for each constant C, the function F(x) + C is also an antiderivative of f over I;
    ii. if G is an antiderivative of f over I, there is a constant C for which G(x) = F(x) + C over I.
In other words, the most general form of the antiderivative of f over I is F(x) + C.

We use this fact and our knowledge of derivatives to find all the antiderivatives for several functions.

   Example 4.50

     Finding Antiderivatives

     For each of the following functions, find all antiderivatives.

     a. f (x) = 3x2

     b.  f  (x)  =   1
                     x

     c. f (x) = cos x

     d. f (x) = ex

     Solution
         a. Because

                                                        d x3 = 3x2
                                                        dx 

         then F(x) = x3 is an antiderivative of 3x2. Therefore, every antiderivative of 3x2 is of the form
         x3 + C for some constant C, and every function of the form x3 + C is an antiderivative of 3x2.

     b. Let f (x) = ln|x|. For x > 0, f (x) = ln(x) and

                                                        d   (ln x)                =  1.
                                                        dx                           x

         For x < 0, f (x) = ln(-x) and

                                              d ln(-x) = - 1 = 1.

                                                        d   (ln|x|)               =  1.

         Thus,   F(x) = ln|x|  is an antiderivative of  1.  Therefore, every antiderivative of      1     is of the form
                                                        x                                           x

         ln|x| + C      for some constant  C  and every function of the form             ln|x| + C  is an antiderivative of  1.

               so F(x) = sin x is an antiderivative of cos x. Therefore, every antiderivative of cos x is of the form
               sin x + C for some constant C and every function of the form sin x + C is an antiderivative of cos x.

                                                                    d (ex) = ex,

               then F(x) = ex is an antiderivative of ex. Therefore, every antiderivative of ex is of the form ex + C
               for some constant C and every function of the form ex + C is an antiderivative of ex.

Indefinite Integrals

We now look at the formal notation used to represent antiderivatives and examine some of their properties. These properties
allow us to find antiderivatives of more complicated functions. Given a function f , we use the notation f  (x) or d fdx
to denote the derivative of f . Here we introduce notation for antiderivatives. If F is an antiderivative of f , we say that
F(x) + C is the most general antiderivative of f and write

                                         f (x)dx = F(x) + C.
The symbol  is called an integral sign, and  f (x)dx is called the indefinite integral of f .

  Definition
  Given a function f , the indefinite integral of f , denoted

                                              f (x)dx,

  is the most general antiderivative of f . If F is an antiderivative of f , then

                                         f (x)dx = F(x) + C.

  The expression f (x) is called the integrand and the variable x is the variable of integration.

Given the terminology introduced in this definition, the act of finding the antiderivatives of a function f is usually referred
to as integrating f .
For a function f and an antiderivative F, the functions F(x) + C, where C is any real number, is often referred to as
the family of antiderivatives of f . For example, since x2 is an antiderivative of 2x and any antiderivative of 2x is of the
form x2 + C, we write
488                                                                                    Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

                                           2xdx = x2 + C.

The collection of all functions of the form x2 + C, where C is any real number, is known as the family of antiderivatives
of 2x. Figure 4.85 shows a graph of this family of antiderivatives.

     Figure 4.85 The family of antiderivatives of 2x consists of all functions of the
     form x2 + C, where C is any real number.

For some functions, evaluating indefinite integrals follows directly from properties of derivatives. For example, for
n  -1,

                            xn dx = xn + 1 + C,

                                        n+1

which comes directly from

                           d xn + 1 = (n + 1) xn = xn.
                           dxn + 1                                                n+1

This fact is known as the power rule for integrals.

Theorem 4.15: Power Rule for Integrals
For n  -1,

                                       xn dx = xn + 1 + C.

                                                                    n+1

Evaluating indefinite integrals for some other functions is also a straightforward calculation. The following table lists the
indefinite integrals for several common functions. A more complete list appears in Appendix B.

Table 4.13 Integration Formulas

From the definition of indefinite integral of f , we know

                                          f (x)dx = F(x) + C
490                                                                                          Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

if and only if F is an antiderivative of f . Therefore, when claiming that

                                          f (x)dx = F(x) + C

it is important to check whether this statement is correct by verifying that F (x) = f (x).

   Example 4.51

     Verifying an Indefinite Integral

     Each of the following statements is of the form  f (x)dx = F(x) + C. Verify that each statement is correct by

     showing that F (x) = f (x).

        a.  (x + ex)dx = x2 + ex + C

                                  2

        b.  xex dx = xex - ex + C

     Solution
         a. Since

                               d x2 x                                                x
                                + e + C = x + e ,
                               dx 2

     the statement

                                (x + ex)dx = x2 + ex + C

                                                  2

         is correct.
         Note that we are verifying an indefinite integral for a sum. Furthermore, x2 and ex are antiderivatives

                                                                                               2
         of x and ex, respectively, and the sum of the antiderivatives is an antiderivative of the sum. We discuss
         this fact again later in this section.

     b. Using the product rule, we see that

                                              d (xex - ex + C) = ex + xex - ex = xex.
                                             dx

     Therefore, the statement

                                xex dx = xex - ex + C

     is correct.
     Note that we are verifying an indefinite integral for a product. The antiderivative xex - ex is not

     a product of the antiderivatives. Furthermore, the product of antiderivatives, x2 ex /2 is not an
     antiderivative of xex since

                               d x2 ex = xex + x2 ex  xex.                        2
                                 
                               dx 2

     In general, the product of antiderivatives is not an antiderivative of a product.

4.50 Verify that  x cos x dx = x sin x + cos x + C.

In Table 4.13, we listed the indefinite integrals for many elementary functions. Let's now turn our attention to evaluating
indefinite integrals for more complicated functions. For example, consider finding an antiderivative of a sum f + g.

In Example 4.51a. we showed that an antiderivative of the sum x + ex is given by the sum x2 + ex --that is, an
                                                                                                          2

antiderivative of a sum is given by a sum of antiderivatives. This result was not specific to this example. In general, if F
and G are antiderivatives of any functions f and g, respectively, then

                                          d (F(x) + G(x)) = F (x) + G (x) = f (x) + g(x).
                                         dx

Therefore, F(x) + G(x) is an antiderivative of f (x) + g(x) and we have

                                             f  (x)  +   g(x)dx          =   F(x)  +  G(x)  +    C.
                                           

Similarly,

                                             f  (x)  -   g(x)dx          =   F(x)  -  G(x)  +    C.
                                           

In addition, consider the task of finding an antiderivative of k f (x), where k is any real number. Since

                                                d     f  (  x      =  k  d   F(x)  =  k  f  (x)
                                             dx                          dx
                                                   k           )

for any real number k, we conclude that

                                                    k f (x)dx = kF(x) + C.

These properties are summarized next.

Theorem 4.16: Properties of Indefinite Integrals
Let F and G be antiderivatives of f and g, respectively, and let k be any real number.
Sums and Differences

                                                f  (x)±g(x)dx            =   F(x)±G(x)      +    C
                                             

Constant Multiples

                                                    k f (x)dx = kF(x) + C

From this theorem, we can evaluate any integral involving a sum, difference, or constant multiple of functions with
antiderivatives that are known. Evaluating integrals involving products, quotients, or compositions is more complicated (see
Example 4.51b. for an example involving an antiderivative of a product.) We look at and address integrals involving these
more complicated functions in Introduction to Integration. In the next example, we examine how to use this theorem to
calculate the indefinite integrals of several functions.

     Evaluating Indefinite Integrals

     Evaluate each of the following indefinite integrals:

     a.        3  -  7x  2  +  3x  +    

           5x                         4dx

             x2 + 43 x

     b.  x dx

     c.  1 + x 4 2dx

     d.  tan xcos xdx

     Solution

         a. Using Properties of Indefinite Integrals, we can integrate each of the four terms in the integrand
              separately. We obtain

                               3      -  7x2  +  3x  +       =       5x3          dx  -    7x2  dx  +    3x  dx  +    4dx.

                               5x                       4dx

         From the second part of Properties of Indefinite Integrals, each coefficient can be written in front of
         the integral sign, which gives

                5x3 dx -  7x2 dx +  3xdx +  4dx = 5 x3 dx - 7 x2 dx + 3 xdx + 4 1dx.

         Using the power rule for integrals, we conclude that

                                        3     -  7x2  +  3x  +       =            5x4  -  7x3  +  3x2  +  4x  +  C.
                                                                                  432
                                        5x                      4dx

     b. Rewrite the integrand as

                                                        x2 + 43 x x2 43 x
                                                            x = x + x = 0.

         Then, to evaluate the integral, integrate each of these terms separately. Using the power rule, we have

                                          x +    4           =  x dx + 4 x-2/3dx
                                            x2/3
                                                         dx

                                                                  12                     1 (-2/3) + 1

Initial-Value Problems

We look at techniques for integrating a large variety of functions involving products, quotients, and compositions later in
the text. Here we turn to one common use for antiderivatives that arises often in many applications: solving differential
equations.

A differential equation is an equation that relates an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. The equation

                                                             dydx = f (x) (4.9)

is a simple example of a differential equation. Solving this equation means finding a function y with a derivative f .
Therefore, the solutions of Equation 4.9 are the antiderivatives of f . If F is one antiderivative of f , every function of
the form y = F(x) + C is a solution of that differential equation. For example, the solutions of

                                                                  dydx = 6x2

are given by

                                                            y =  6x2 dx = 2x3 + C.

Sometimes we are interested in determining whether a particular solution curve passes through a certain point (x0, y0)
--that is, y(x0) = y0. The problem of finding a function y that satisfies a differential equation

                                                                  dydx = f (x)                  (4.10)

with the additional condition

                                                                  y(x0) = y0                    (4.11)

is an example of an initial-value problem. The condition y(x0) = y0 is known as an initial condition. For example,
looking for a function y that satisfies the differential equation

                                                                  dydx = 6x2

and the initial condition

                                                                  y(1) = 5

is an example of an initial-value problem. Since the solutions of the differential equation are y = 2x3 + C, to find a
function y that also satisfies the initial condition, we need to find C such that y(1) = 2(1)3 + C = 5. From this equation,
we see that C = 3, and we conclude that y = 2x3 + 3 is the solution of this initial-value problem as shown in the
following graph.
494  Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

                        Figure 4.86 Some of the solution curves of the differential equation dydx = 6x2
                        are displayed. The function y = 2x3 + 3 satisfies the differential equation and the
                        initial condition y(1) = 5.

   Example 4.53

     Solving an Initial-Value Problem

      Solve the initial-value problem
                                                          dydx = sin x, y(0) = 5.

     Solution
     First we need to solve the differential equation. If dydx = sin x, then

                                     y =  sin(x)dx = -cos x + C.

     Next we need to look for a solution y that satisfies the initial condition. The initial condition y(0) = 5 means
     we need a constant C such that -cos x + C = 5. Therefore,

                                                          C = 5 + cos(0) = 6.
     The solution of the initial-value problem is y = -cos x + 6.

        4.52 Solve the initial value problem dydx = 3x-2, y(1) = 2.

Initial-value problems arise in many applications. Next we consider a problem in which a driver applies the brakes in a car.

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives                                                                                   495

We are interested in how long it takes for the car to stop. Recall that the velocity function v(t) is the derivative of a position
function s(t), and the acceleration a(t) is the derivative of the velocity function. In earlier examples in the text, we could
calculate the velocity from the position and then compute the acceleration from the velocity. In the next example we work
the other way around. Given an acceleration function, we calculate the velocity function. We then use the velocity function
to determine the position function.

   Example 4.54

     Decelerating Car

A car is traveling at the rate of 88 ft/sec (60 mph) when the brakes are applied. The car begins decelerating at a
constant rate of 15 ft/sec2.

    a. How many seconds elapse before the car stops?

    b. How far does the car travel during that time?

Solution

    a. First we introduce variables for this problem. Let t be the time (in seconds) after the brakes are first
         applied. Let a(t) be the acceleration of the car (in feet per seconds squared) at time t. Let v(t) be the
         velocity of the car (in feet per second) at time t. Let s(t) be the car's position (in feet) beyond the point
         where the brakes are applied at time t.
         The car is traveling at a rate of 88 ft/sec. Therefore, the initial velocity is v(0) = 88 ft/sec. Since the car
         is decelerating, the acceleration is

                                                           a(t) = -15 ft/s2.

The acceleration is the derivative of the velocity,
                                                    v (t) = -15.

Therefore, we have an initial-value problem to solve:
                                              v (t) = -15, v(0) = 88.

Integrating, we find that

                                         v(t) = -15t + C.

Since v(0) = 88, C = 88. Thus, the velocity function is
                                                 v(t) = -15t + 88.

    To find how long it takes for the car to stop, we need to find the time t such that the velocity is zero.
    Solving -15t + 88 = 0, we obtain t = 88 sec.

                                                     15

b. To find how far the car travels during this time, we need to find the position of the car after 88 sec. We
                                                                                                                15

    know the velocity v(t) is the derivative of the position s(t). Consider the initial position to be s(0) = 0.
    Therefore, we need to solve the initial-value problem

                                                s (t) = -15t + 88, s(0) = 0.

     Integrating, we have

                                              s(t) = - 15t2 + 88t + C.
                                                          2

     Since s(0) = 0, the constant is C = 0. Therefore, the position function is
                                                    s(t) = - 15t2 + 88t.
                                                                 2

     After  t=  88  sec, the position is  s88     258.133                         ft.

                                           
                15                        15

     4.53 Suppose the car is traveling at the rate of 44 ft/sec. How long does it take for the car to stop? How far
     will the car travel?

KEY CONCEPTS

4.1 Related Rates

     · To solve a related rates problem, first draw a picture that illustrates the relationship between the two or more related
         quantities that are changing with respect to time.

     · In terms of the quantities, state the information given and the rate to be found.
     · Find an equation relating the quantities.
     · Use differentiation, applying the chain rule as necessary, to find an equation that relates the rates.
     · Be sure not to substitute a variable quantity for one of the variables until after finding an equation relating the rates.

4.2 Linear Approximations and Differentials

     · A differentiable function y = f (x) can be approximated at a by the linear function

                                                           L(x) = f (a) + f (a)(x - a).
     · For a function y = f (x), if x changes from a to a + dx, then

                                                                   dy = f (x)dx

         is an approximation for the change in y. The actual change in y is

                                                             y = f (a + dx) - f (a).
     · A measurement error dx can lead to an error in a calculated quantity f (x). The error in the calculated quantity is

         known as the propagated error. The propagated error can be estimated by
                                                                   dy  f (x)dx.
                                                                                          q

     · To estimate the relative error of a particular quantity q, we estimate q .

4.3 Maxima and Minima

     · A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum, have just one absolute extremum, or
         have no absolute maximum or absolute minimum.

     · If a function has a local extremum, the point at which it occurs must be a critical point. However, a function need
         not have a local extremum at a critical point.

     · A continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. Each
         extremum occurs at a critical point or an endpoint.

4.4 The Mean Value Theorem

     · If f is continuous over [a, b] and differentiable over (a, b) and f (a) = 0 = f (b), then there exists a point
         c  (a, b) such that f  (c) = 0. This is Rolle's theorem.

     · If f is continuous over [a, b] and differentiable over (a, b), then there exists a point c  (a, b) such that

                                                               f (c) = f (b) - f (a) b - a .
502                                                                               Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives

         This is the Mean Value Theorem.
     · If f (x) = 0 over an interval I, then f is constant over I.
     · If two differentiable functions f and g satisfy f (x) = g(x) over I, then f (x) = g(x) + C for some constant

         C.
     · If f  (x) > 0 over an interval I, then f is increasing over I. If f (x) < 0 over I, then f is decreasing over

         I.

4.5 Derivatives and the Shape of a Graph

     · If c is a critical point of f and f  (x) > 0 for x < c and f  (x) < 0 for x > c, then f has a local maximum at
         c.

     · If c is a critical point of f and f  (x) < 0 for x < c and f  (x) > 0 for x > c, then f has a local minimum at
         c.

     · If f (x) > 0 over an interval I, then f is concave up over I.
     · If f (x) < 0 over an interval I, then f is concave down over I.
     · If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c.
     · If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) < 0, then f has a local maximum at c.
     · If f  (c) = 0 and f (c) = 0, then evaluate f  (x) at a test point x to the left of c and a test point x to the right

         of c, to determine whether f has a local extremum at c.

4.6 Limits at Infinity and Asymptotes

     · The limit of f (x) is L as x   (or as x  -) if the values f (x) become arbitrarily close to L as x
         becomes sufficiently large.

     · The limit of f (x) is  as x   if f (x) becomes arbitrarily large as x becomes sufficiently large. The limit

      of f (x) is - as x   if f (x) < 0 and | f (x)| becomes arbitrarily large as x becomes sufficiently large. We

         can define the limit of f (x) as x approaches - similarly.

     · For a polynomial function p(x) = an xn + an - 1 xn - 1 + ... + a1 x + a0, where an  0, the end behavior is
         determined by the leading term an xn. If n  0, p(x) approaches  or - at each end.

     · For a rational function f (x) = p(x) q(x) , the end behavior is determined by the relationship between the degree of p
         and the degree of q. If the degree of p is less than the degree of q, the line y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote for
          f . If the degree of p is equal to the degree of q, then the line y = abn is a horizontal asymptote, where n an and
         bn are the leading coefficients of p and q, respectively. If the degree of p is greater than the degree of q, then
          f approaches  or - at each end.

4.7 Applied Optimization Problems

     · To solve an optimization problem, begin by drawing a picture and introducing variables.
     · Find an equation relating the variables.
     · Find a function of one variable to describe the quantity that is to be minimized or maximized.

· Look for critical points to locate local extrema.

4.8 L'Hôpital's Rule

     · L'Hôpital's rule can be used to evaluate the limit of a quotient when the indeterminate form 0 or / arises.
                                                                                                                   0

     · L'Hôpital's rule can also be applied to other indeterminate forms if they can be rewritten in terms of a limit involving
         a quotient that has the indeterminate form 0 or /.
                                                          0

     · The exponential function ex grows faster than any power function x p, p > 0.
     · The logarithmic function ln x grows more slowly than any power function x p, p > 0.

4.9 Newton's Method

     · Newton's method approximates roots of f (x) = 0 by starting with an initial approximation x0, then uses tangent
         lines to the graph of f to create a sequence of approximations x1, x2, x3 ,....

     · Typically, Newton's method is an efficient method for finding a particular root. In certain cases, Newton's method
         fails to work because the list of numbers x0, x1, x2 ,... does not approach a finite value or it approaches a value
         other than the root sought.

     · Any process in which a list of numbers x0, x1, x2 ,... is generated by defining an initial number x0 and defining
         the subsequent numbers by the equation xn = F(xn - 1) for some function F is an iterative process. Newton's
                                                                                             f (x) 
        method is an example of an iterative process, where the function F(x) = x -   for a given function f .
                                                                                                    f  (x)

4.10 Antiderivatives

     · If F is an antiderivative of f , then every antiderivative of f is of the form F(x) + C for some constant C.
     · Solving the initial-value problem

                                                              dydx = f (x), y(x0) = y0

         requires us first to find the set of antiderivatives of f and then to look for the particular antiderivative that also
         satisfies the initial condition.

Introduction

Iceboats are a common sight on the lakes of Wisconsin and Minnesota on winter weekends. Iceboats are similar to sailboats,
but they are fitted with runners, or "skates," and are designed to run over the ice, rather than on water. Iceboats can move
very quickly, and many ice boating enthusiasts are drawn to the sport because of the speed. Top iceboat racers can attain

speeds up to five times the wind speed. If we know how fast an iceboat is moving, we can use integration to determine how
far it travels. We revisit this question later in the chapter (see Example 5.27).

Determining distance from velocity is just one of many applications of integration. In fact, integrals are used in a wide
variety of mechanical and physical applications. In this chapter, we first introduce the theory behind integration and use
integrals to calculate areas. From there, we develop the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which relates differentiation and
integration. We then study some basic integration techniques and briefly examine some applications.

5.1 | Approximating Areas

                                  Learning Objectives

     5.1.1 Use sigma (summation) notation to calculate sums and powers of integers.
     5.1.2 Use the sum of rectangular areas to approximate the area under a curve.
     5.1.3 Use Riemann sums to approximate area.

Archimedes was fascinated with calculating the areas of various shapes--in other words, the amount of space enclosed by
the shape. He used a process that has come to be known as the method of exhaustion, which used smaller and smaller shapes,
the areas of which could be calculated exactly, to fill an irregular region and thereby obtain closer and closer approximations
to the total area. In this process, an area bounded by curves is filled with rectangles, triangles, and shapes with exact area
formulas. These areas are then summed to approximate the area of the curved region.

In this section, we develop techniques to approximate the area between a curve, defined by a function f (x), and the x-axis

on a closed interval           Like Archimedes, we first approximate the area under the curve using shapes of known area

                      a,  b.

(namely, rectangles). By using smaller and smaller rectangles, we get closer and closer approximations to the area. Taking

a limit allows us to calculate the exact area under the curve.

Let's start by introducing some notation to make the calculations easier. We then consider the case when f (x) is continuous

and nonnegative. Later in the chapter, we relax some of these restrictions and develop techniques that apply in more general
cases.

Sigma (Summation) Notation

As mentioned, we will use shapes of known area to approximate the area of an irregular region bounded by curves. This
process often requires adding up long strings of numbers. To make it easier to write down these lengthy sums, we look at
some new notation here, called sigma notation (also known as summation notation). The Greek capital letter , sigma,

is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For example, if we want to add all the integers from 1 to 20
without sigma notation, we have to write

              1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20.
We could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write

                               1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +  + 19 + 20,

which is better, but still cumbersome. With sigma notation, we write this sum as

                                                     20

                                                     i,

                                                    i=1

which is much more compact.
Typically, sigma notation is presented in the form

                                                      n

                                                     ai

                                                    i=1

where ai describes the terms to be added, and the i is called the index. Each term is evaluated, then we sum all the values,

                                                                                                                                                                     7

beginning with the value when i = 1 and ending with the value when i = n. For example, an expression like  si is

                                                                                                                                                                   i=2

interpreted as s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 + s7. Note that the index is used only to keep track of the terms to be added; it does
not factor into the calculation of the sum itself. The index is therefore called a dummy variable. We can use any letter we
like for the index. Typically, mathematicians use i, j, k, m, and n for indices.
Let's try a couple of examples of using sigma notation.

   Example 5.1

     Using Sigma Notation

          a. Write in sigma notation and evaluate the sum of terms 3i for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
           b. Write the sum in sigma notation:

                                                              1+1+1+ 1 + 1.
                                                                   4 9 16 25

     Solution
           a. Write

                                                                       5

                                        3i = 3 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35

                                                                     i=1

                                                                 = 363.
           b. The denominator of each term is a perfect square. Using sigma notation, this sum can be written as

                     5

            1.

               i = 1 i2

5.1 Write in sigma notation and evaluate the sum of terms 2i for i = 3, 4, 5, 6.

The properties associated with the summation process are given in the following rule.

A few more formulas for frequently found functions simplify the summation process further. These are shown in the next

Approximating Area

Now that we have the necessary notation, we return to the problem at hand: approximating the area under a curve. Let f (x)

be a continuous, nonnegative function defined on the closed interval                               We want to approximate the area A bounded by

                                                                                        a,    b.

f (x) above, the x-axis below, the line x = a on the left, and the line x = b on the right (Figure 5.2).

                                       Figure 5.2 An area (shaded region) bounded by the curve
                                        f (x) at top, the x-axis at bottom, the line x = a to the left, and

                                       the line x = b at right.

How do we approximate the area under this curve? The approach is a geometric one. By dividing a region into many small

shapes that have known area formulas, we can sum these areas and obtain a reasonable estimate of the true area. We begin

by dividing the interval         a, b  into n subintervals of equal width,              b - a.     We do this by selecting equally spaced points
                                                                                          n

x0, x1, x2 ,..., xn with x0 = a, xn = b, and

                                                xi  -                 xi  -  1    =  b  -  a
                                                                                        n

for i = 1, 2, 3,..., n.

We denote the width of each subinterval with the notation x, so                      x =      b-a  and
                                                                                                n

                                                    xi = x0 + ix

for    i  =  1,   2,  3,..., n.  This notion of dividing an interval              into subintervals by selecting points from within the interval

                                                                      a,     b

is used quite often in approximating the area under a curve, so let's define some relevant terminology.

Definition

A set of points P = {xi} for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n with a = x0 < x1 < x2 <  < xn = b, which divides the interval

     a, b        into subintervals of the form  [x0, x1], [x1, x2],..., [xn - 1, xn]               is called a partition of      a, b.  If the

subintervals all have the same width, the set of points forms a                      regular partition of the interval         

                                                                                                                        a,  b.

We can use this regular partition as the basis of a method for estimating the area under the curve. We next examine two
methods: the left-endpoint approximation and the right-endpoint approximation.

Rule: Left-Endpoint Approximation

On each subinterval [xi - 1, xi] (for i = 1, 2, 3,..., n), construct a rectangle with width x and height equal to
 f (xi - 1), which is the function value at the left endpoint of the subinterval. Then the area of this rectangle is
 f (xi - 1)x. Adding the areas of all these rectangles, we get an approximate value for A (Figure 5.3). We use the
notation Ln to denote that this is a left-endpoint approximation of A using n subintervals.

                         A  Ln = f (x0)x + f (x1)x +  + f (xn - 1)x                         (5.6)

                              n

                         =  f (xi - 1)x

                            i=1

                         Figure 5.3 In the left-endpoint approximation of area under a
                         curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the function
                         value at the left of each subinterval.

The second method for approximating area under a curve is the right-endpoint approximation. It is almost the same as the
left-endpoint approximation, but now the heights of the rectangles are determined by the function values at the right of each
subinterval.

Rule: Right-Endpoint Approximation

Construct a rectangle on each subinterval [xi - 1, xi], only this time the height of the rectangle is determined by the
function value f (xi) at the right endpoint of the subinterval. Then, the area of each rectangle is f (xi)x and the
approximation for A is given by

                         A  Rn = f (x1)x + f (x2)x +  + f (xn)x                             (5.7)

                                                                 n

                                 =  f (xi)x.

                                                               i=1

The notation Rn indicates this is a right-endpoint approximation for A (Figure 5.4).

                                     a curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the
                                     function value at the right of each subinterval. Note that the
                                     right-endpoint approximation differs from the left-endpoint
                                     approximation in Figure 5.3.

The graphs in Figure 5.5 represent the curve f (x) = x2. In graph (a) we divide the region represented by the interval
                                                                 2

[0, 3] into six subintervals, each of width 0.5. Thus, x = 0.5. We then form six rectangles by drawing vertical lines

perpendicular to xi - 1, the left endpoint of each subinterval. We determine the height of each rectangle by calculating

f (xi - 1)  for  i = 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6.  The intervals are      0.5,  0.5,           1.5,  1.5,           2.5,  2.5,       We find the area

                                                                0,              1,   1,              2,   2,              3.

of each rectangle by multiplying the height by the width. Then, the sum of the rectangular areas approximates the area

between f (x) and the x-axis. When the left endpoints are used to calculate height, we have a left-endpoint approximation.

Thus,

Approximating the Area Under a Curve

Use both left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations to approximate the area under the curve of f (x) = x2
on the interval [0, 2]; use n = 4.

Solution

First, divide the interval [0, 2] into n equal subintervals. Using n = 4, x = (2 - 0) = 0.5. This is the width of
                                                                                             4

each rectangle. The intervals      0.5,  0.5,           1.5,  1.5,       are shown in Figure  5.6. Using a left-endpoint

                               0,              1,   1,              2

approximation, the heights are f (0) = 0, f (0.5) = 0.25, f (1) = 1, f (1.5) = 2.25. Then,

                               L4 = f (x0)x + f (x1)x + f (x2)x + f (x3)x
                                    = 0(0.5) + 0.25(0.5) + 1(0.5) + 2.25(0.5)
                                    = 1.75.

                         of the area under f (x) = x2 from 0 to 2.

The right-endpoint approximation is shown in Figure 5.7. The intervals are the same, x = 0.5,  but now use
the right endpoint to calculate the height of the rectangles. We have

                                   R4 = f (x1)x + f (x2)x + f (x3)x + f (x4)x

     The left-endpoint approximation is 1.75; the right-endpoint approximation is 3.75.

                                                                                                         x

     Approximate the area using both methods.

Looking at Figure 5.5 and the graphs in Example 5.4, we can see that when we use a small number of intervals, neither
the left-endpoint approximation nor the right-endpoint approximation is a particularly accurate estimate of the area under
the curve. However, it seems logical that if we increase the number of points in our partition, our estimate of A will improve.
We will have more rectangles, but each rectangle will be thinner, so we will be able to fit the rectangles to the curve more
precisely.

We can demonstrate the improved approximation obtained through smaller intervals with an example. Let's explore the idea
of increasing n, first in a left-endpoint approximation with four rectangles, then eight rectangles, and finally 32 rectangles.
Then, let's do the same thing in a right-endpoint approximation, using the same sets of intervals, of the same curved region.
Figure 5.8 shows the area of the region under the curve f (x) = (x - 1)3 + 4 on the interval [0, 2] using a left-endpoint
approximation where n = 4. The width of each rectangle is

                                                            x = 2 - 0 = 1.

The area is approximated by the summed areas of the rectangles, or

                                      L4 = f (0)(0.5) + f (0.5)(0.5) + f (1)(0.5) + f (1.5)0.5

Figure 5.9 shows the same curve divided into eight subintervals. Comparing the graph with four rectangles in Figure 5.8
with this graph with eight rectangles, we can see there appears to be less white space under the curve when n = 8. This
white space is area under the curve we are unable to include using our approximation. The area of the rectangles is

                               L8 = f (0)(0.25) + f (0.25)(0.25) + f (0.5)(0.25) + f (0.75)(0.25)

                                     = 7.75.

The graph in Figure 5.10 shows the same function with 32 rectangles inscribed under the curve. There appears to be little
white space left. The area occupied by the rectangles is

                 L32 = f (0)(0.0625) + f (0.0625)(0.0625) + f (0.125)(0.0625) +  + f (1.9375)(0.0625)
                       = 7.9375.

                                       for a left-endpoint approximation.

We can carry out a similar process for the right-endpoint approximation method. A right-endpoint approximation of the
same curve, using four rectangles (Figure 5.11), yields an area

                                     R4 = f (0.5)(0.5) + f (1)(0.5) + f (1.5)(0.5) + f (2)(0.5)
                                          = 8.5.

                                       Figure 5.11 Now we divide the area under the curve into four
                                       equal subintervals for a right-endpoint approximation.
Dividing the region over the interval [0, 2] into eight rectangles results in x = 2 - 0 = 0.25. The graph is shown in

                                                                                                   8

                               R8 = f (0.25)(0.25) + f (0.5)(0.25) + f (0.75)(0.25) + f (1)(0.25)
                                    + f (1.25)(0.25) + f (1.5)(0.25) + f (1.75)(0.25) + f (2)(0.25)
                                     = 8.25.

                                       Figure 5.12 Here we use right-endpoint approximation for a
                                       region divided into eight equal subintervals.
Last, the right-endpoint approximation with n = 32 is close to the actual area (Figure 5.13). The area is approximately
                 R32 = f (0.0625)(0.0625) + f (0.125)(0.0625) + f (0.1875)(0.0625) +  + f (2)(0.0625)
                       = 8.0625.

                                       for a right-endpoint approximation.
Based on these figures and calculations, it appears we are on the right track; the rectangles appear to approximate the area
under the curve better as n gets larger. Furthermore, as n increases, both the left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations
appear to approach an area of 8 square units. Table 5.1 shows a numerical comparison of the left- and right-endpoint

important, and we now explore this idea in more detail.

Forming Riemann Sums

So far we have been using rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. The heights of these rectangles have been

determined by evaluating the function at either the right or left endpoints of the subinterval [xi - 1, xi]. In reality, there is

no reason to restrict evaluation of the function to one of these two points only. We could evaluate the function at any point

xi in the subinterval [xi - 1, xi],  and use          as the height of our rectangle. This gives us an estimate for the area of

                                              f x*i 

the form

                                                             n
                                                                             
                                                      A
                                                                      f x*i  x.

                                                             i=1

A sum of this form is called a Riemann sum, named for the 19th-century mathematician Bernhard Riemann, who developed
the idea.

Definition

Let  f (x)  be defined on a closed interval   a, b    and let P be a regular partition of       a, b.    Let x be the width of each

subinterval [xi - 1, xi] and for each i, let x*i be any point in [xi - 1, xi]. A Riemann sum is defined for f (x) as

                                                           n

                                                                     

                                                          f x*i x.

                                                         i=1

Recall that with the left- and right-endpoint approximations, the estimates seem to get better and better as n get larger and
larger. The same thing happens with Riemann sums. Riemann sums give better approximations for larger values of n. We
are now ready to define the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums.

     See a graphical demonstration (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_riemannsums) of the construction of a
     Riemann sum.

Some subtleties here are worth discussing. First, note that taking the limit of a sum is a little different from taking the limit
of a function f (x) as x goes to infinity. Limits of sums are discussed in detail in the chapter on Sequences and Series

(http://cnx.org/content/m53756/latest/) ; however, for now we can assume that the computational techniques we used
to compute limits of functions can also be used to calculate limits of sums.

Second, we must consider what to do if the expression converges to different limits for different choices of                               
                                                                                                                                           x*i .

                                                                                                                                           

Fortunately, this does not happen. Although the proof is beyond the scope of this text, it can be shown that if f (x) is

                                                                   n

on the choice of    
                    x*i  ).

                         

We look at some examples shortly. But, before we do, let's take a moment and talk about some specific choices for                          
                                                                                                                                           x*i  .

                                                                                                                                                

Although any choice for              gives us an estimate of the area under the curve, we don't necessarily know whether that
                             x*i  
                                  

estimate is too high (overestimate) or too low (underestimate). If it is important to know whether our estimate is high or

low, we can select our value for            to guarantee one result or the other.
                                     x*i  
                                          

If we want an overestimate, for example, we can choose                            such that for      i = 1, 2, 3,..., n,            f (x)  for all

                                                                          i 

x  [xi - 1,   xi].  In other words, we choose                 so that for    i = 1,  2,  3,..., n,            is the maximum function value on
                                                                                                            
                                                   x*i                                               f x*i

                                                                                                     n
the interval                 If we select          in  this   way,    then   the  Riemann  sum                           is called an upper sum.
              [xi - 1, xi].                 x*i  
                                                                                                     i=1      f x*i x

Similarly, if we want an underestimate, we can choose                     so that for    i = 1,  2,  3,..., n,           is the minimum function
                                                                                                                       
                                                                   x*i                                          f x*i

value on the interval [xi - 1, xi]. In this case, the associated Riemann sum is called a lower sum. Note that if f (x) is either

increasing or decreasing throughout the interval                      then the maximum and minimum values of the function occur at the

                                                          a,  b,

endpoints of the subintervals, so the upper and lower sums are just the same as the left- and right-endpoint approximations.

         1.25,  1.25,    1.5,  1.5,  1.75,  1.75,         Because the function is decreasing over the interval            [1,  2],  Figure

Solution
Let's first look at the graph in Figure 5.15 to get a better idea of the area of interest.

          Figure 5.15 The graph of y = sin x is divided into six regions: x = /2 =  .
                                                                                            6 12

     The intervals are       ,   ,           ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , 5 , and 5 ,  .                    Note   that  f (x) = sin x is

                                            so a left-endpoint approximation gives us the

In the preceding section we defined the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums:

                                                                n

                                                        n             f x*i  x.

However, this definition came with restrictions. We required f (x) to be continuous and nonnegative. Unfortunately, real-

world problems don't always meet these restrictions. In this section, we look at how to apply the concept of the area under
the curve to a broader set of functions through the use of the definite integral.

Definition and Notation

The definite integral generalizes the concept of the area under a curve. We lift the requirements that f (x) be continuous
and nonnegative, and define the definite integral as follows.

Definition

If  f (x)  is a function defined on an interval  a, b,  the definite integral of f from a to b is given by

                           b                                       n                                         (5.8)
                                                                         
                              f (x)dx =                 lim
                           a n  i = 1                                  f x*i x,

provided the limit exists. If this limit exists, the function   f (x)  is said to be integrable on           or is an integrable

                                                                                                    a,  b,

function.

The integral symbol in the previous definition should look familiar. We have seen similar notation in the chapter on
Applications of Derivatives, where we used the indefinite integral symbol (without the a and b above and below) to
represent an antiderivative. Although the notation for indefinite integrals may look similar to the notation for a definite
integral, they are not the same. A definite integral is a number. An indefinite integral is a family of functions. Later in this
chapter we examine how these concepts are related. However, close attention should always be paid to notation so we know
whether we're working with a definite integral or an indefinite integral.

Integral notation goes back to the late seventeenth century and is one of the contributions of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who

is often considered to be the codiscoverer of calculus, along with Isaac Newton. The integration symbol  is an elongated S,

suggesting sigma or summation. On a definite integral, above and below the summation symbol are the boundaries of the

interval,           The numbers a and b are x-values and are called the limits of integration; specifically, a is the lower limit

           a,  b.

and b is the upper limit. To clarify, we are using the word limit in two different ways in the context of the definite integral.

First, we talk about the limit of a sum as n  . Second, the boundaries of the region are called the limits of integration.

We call the function f (x) the integrand, and the dx indicates that f (x) is a function with respect to x, called the variable

of integration. Note that, like the index in a sum, the variable of integration is a dummy variable, and has no impact on the
computation of the integral. We could use any variable we like as the variable of integration:

                          b f (x)dx =  b f (t)dt =  b f (u)duaa              a

Previously, we discussed the fact that if           is continuous on                      then the limit                     exists and is
                                            f (x)                                 a, b,                   lim
                                                                                                                    f x*i x
                                                                                                          n    i=1

unique. This leads to the following theorem, which we state without proof.

Theorem 5.1: Continuous Functions Are Integrable

If   f (x)  is continuous on  a, b,  then f is integrable on         

                                                              a,  b.

Functions that are not continuous on      a, b  may still be integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities. For

example, functions with a finite number of jump discontinuities on a closed interval are integrable.

It is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This restriction is not
strictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a nonregular partition is used to define
the definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we must take
the limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in our limits and
makes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with regular partitions for
the Riemann sums.

     Example 5.7

     Evaluating an Integral Using the Definition

     Use the definition of the definite integral to evaluate  2x2 dx. Use a right-endpoint approximation to generate

                                                                                     0

     the Riemann sum.

     Solution

     We first want to set up a Riemann sum. Based on the limits of integration, we have a = 0 and b = 2. For
     i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of [0, 2]. Then

                                                           x = b - a = 2.
                                                                     nn

     Since we are using a right-endpoint approximation to generate Riemann sums, for each i, we need to calculate
     the function value at the right endpoint of the interval [xi - 1, xi]. The right endpoint of the interval is xi, and
     since P is a regular partition,

                                                xi  =  x0  +  ix  =  0            +  2    =  2i.
                                                                                     in      n

     Thus, the function value at the right endpoint of the interval is

                                                              2 2i2 4i2
                                                    f (xi) = xi =  n  = 2 .

                                                                              n

     Then the Riemann sum takes the form

Evaluating Definite Integrals

Evaluating definite integrals this way can be quite tedious because of the complexity of the calculations. Later in this chapter
we develop techniques for evaluating definite integrals without taking limits of Riemann sums. However, for now, we can
rely on the fact that definite integrals represent the area under the curve, and we can evaluate definite integrals by using
geometric formulas to calculate that area. We do this to confirm that definite integrals do, indeed, represent areas, so we can
then discuss what to do in the case of a curve of a function dropping below the x-axis.

Area and the Definite Integral

When we defined the definite integral, we lifted the requirement that f (x) be nonnegative. But how do we interpret "the
area under the curve" when f (x) is negative?

Net Signed Area

Let us return to the Riemann sum. Consider, for example, the function f (x) = 2 - 2x2 (shown in Figure 5.17) on

                                                                                                 

the interval [0, 2]. Use n = 8 and choose x*i } as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on each

subinterval of height            and  width  x.  When                 is  positive,       the  product            represents the area of the
                                                                    
                       f x*i                                 f x*i                                      f x*i x

rectangle, as before. When            is negative, however, the product                               represents the negative of the area of the

                              f x*i                                                       f x*i x

rectangle. The Riemann sum then becomes

     8
                       
                              =  Area  of  rectangles   above       the  x-axis        -  Area    of  rectangles  below  the  x-axis

                         Figure 5.17 For a function that is partly negative, the
                         Riemann sum is the area of the rectangles above the x-axis less
                         the area of the rectangles below the x-axis.

Taking the limit as n  , the Riemann sum approaches the area between the curve above the x-axis and the x-axis, less
the area between the curve below the x-axis and the x-axis, as shown in Figure 5.18. Then,

                          2 f (x)dx                                n

                                                     = A1 - A2.

The quantity A1 - A2 is called the net signed area.

                                       Figure 5.18 In the limit, the definite integral equals area A1
                                       less area A2, or the net signed area.

Notice that net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero. If the area above the x-axis is larger, the net signed area is
positive. If the area below the x-axis is larger, the net signed area is negative. If the areas above and below the x-axis are
equal, the net signed area is zero.

     Find the net signed area between the curve of the function f (x) = 2x and the x-axis over the interval [-3, 3].

     Solution
     The function produces a straight line that forms two triangles: one from x = -3 to x = 0 and the other from
     x = 0 to x = 3 (Figure 5.19). Using the geometric formula for the area of a triangle, A = 1bh, the area of

                                                                                                                  2
     triangle A1, above the axis, is

                                                           A1 = 13(6) = 9,
                                                                  2

     where 3 is the base and 2(3) = 6 is the height. The area of triangle A2, below the axis, is

                                                          A2 = 1(3)(6) = 9,
                                                                 2

     where 3 is the base and 6 is the height. Thus, the net area is

                                                                3

                                     2xdx = A1 - A2 = 9 - 9 = 0.

                                     equals the area below the curve and above the x-axis.

     Analysis
     If A1 is the area above the x-axis and A2 is the area below the x-axis, then the net area is A1 - A2. Since the areas
     of the two triangles are equal, the net area is zero.

velocity of an object as a function of time, then the area under the curve tells us how far the object is from its original
position. This is a very important application of the definite integral, and we examine it in more detail later in the chapter.
For now, we're just going to look at some basics to get a feel for how this works by studying constant velocities.

When velocity is a constant, the area under the curve is just velocity times time. This idea is already very familiar. If a car
travels away from its starting position in a straight line at a speed of 75 mph for 2 hours, then it is 150 mi away from its
original position (Figure 5.20). Using integral notation, we have

                                            275dt = 150.

                                                                               0

                         Figure 5.20 The area under the curve v(t) = 75 tells us how far the car
                         is from its starting point at a given time.

In the context of displacement, net signed area allows us to take direction into account. If a car travels straight north at a
speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, it is 120 mi north of its starting position. If the car then turns around and travels south at a
speed of 40 mph for 3 hours, it will be back at it starting position (Figure 5.21). Again, using integral notation, we have

                                         260dt +  5-40dt  = 120 - 120
                                        0  2              = 0.

In this case the displacement is zero.
536                                                                                     Chapter 5 | Integration

                   Figure 5.21 The area above the axis and the area below the axis
                   are equal, so the net signed area is zero.

Suppose we want to know how far the car travels overall, regardless of direction. In this case, we want to know the area
between the curve and the x-axis, regardless of whether that area is above or below the axis. This is called the total area.

Graphically, it is easiest to think of calculating total area by adding the areas above the axis and the areas below the axis
(rather than subtracting the areas below the axis, as we did with net signed area). To accomplish this mathematically, we use
the absolute value function. Thus, the total distance traveled by the car is

                   2  5                                       =  260dt +  540dt
                    |60|dt +  |-40|dt
                   0  2                                                           0  2

                                                              = 120 + 120

                                                              = 240.

Bringing these ideas together formally, we state the following definitions.

Definition

Let  f (x)  be an integrable function defined on an interval  a, b.                  Let A1 represent the area between  f (x)  and the

x-axis that lies above the axis and let A2 represent the area between f (x) and the x-axis that lies below the axis. Then,

the net signed area between f (x) and the x-axis is given by

                                                                       b

                                       f (x)dx = A1 - A2.

                                                                      a

The total area between f (x) and the x-axis is given by

Finding the Total Area

Find the total area between       f (x) = x - 2  and the x-axis over the interval  0, 6.

Solution

Calculate the x-intercept as (2, 0) (set y = 0, solve for x). To find the total area, take the area below the x-axis

over the subinterval     [0,  2]  and add it to the area above the x-axis on the subinterval           (Figure  5.22).

                                                                                              2,  6

                              Figure 5.22 The total area between the line and the x-axis

                              over           is A2 plus A1.

                                    0,  6

We have

                                                    6

                                                  |(x - 2)|dx = A2 + A1.

                                                   0

Then, using the formula for the area of a triangle, we obtain

                                                 A2 = 1bh = 1 · 2 · 2 = 2
                                                        22

                                                 A1 = 1bh = 1 · 4 · 4 = 8.
                                                        22

The total area, then, is

                                                 A1 + A2 = 8 + 2 = 10.

Properties of the Definite Integral

The properties of indefinite integrals apply to definite integrals as well. Definite integrals also have properties that relate to
the limits of integration. These properties, along with the rules of integration that we examine later in this chapter, help us
manipulate expressions to evaluate definite integrals.

          If the limits of integration are the same, the integral is just a line and contains no area.

         Although this formula normally applies when c is between a and b, the formula holds for all values of a, b, and
         c, provided f (x) is integrable on the largest interval.

By property 6.,

Thus,

Comparison Properties of Integrals

A picture can sometimes tell us more about a function than the results of computations. Comparing functions by their graphs
as well as by their algebraic expressions can often give new insight into the process of integration. Intuitively, we might say
that if a function f (x) is above another function g(x), then the area between f (x) and the x-axis is greater than the area
between g(x) and the x-axis. This is true depending on the interval over which the comparison is made. The properties of
definite integrals are valid whether a < b, a = b, or a > b. The following properties, however, concern only the case
a  b, and are used when we want to compare the sizes of integrals.

     Example 5.13

       Comparing Two Functions over a Given Interval

       Compare f (x) = 1 + x2 and g(x) = 1 + x over the interval [0, 1].

       Solution
       Graphing these functions is necessary to understand how they compare over the interval [0, 1]. Initially, when
       graphed on a graphing calculator, f (x) appears to be above g(x) everywhere. However, on the interval [0, 1],
       the graphs appear to be on top of each other. We need to zoom in to see that, on the interval [0, 1], g(x) is above
        f (x). The two functions intersect at x = 0 and x = 1 (Figure 5.23).

     Figure 5.23 (a) The function f (x) appears above the function g(x)
     except over the interval [0, 1] (b) Viewing the same graph with a greater
     zoom shows this more clearly.

     We can see from the graph that over the interval [0, 1], g(x)  f (x). Comparing the integrals over the specified

     interval [0, 1], we also see that  1g(x)dx   1 f (x)dx (Figure 5.24). The thin, red-shaded area shows just
     0                                     0

     how much difference there is between these two integrals over the interval [0, 1].

                                clearly.

Average Value of a Function

We often need to find the average of a set of numbers, such as an average test grade. Suppose you received the following
test scores in your algebra class: 89, 90, 56, 78, 100, and 69. Your semester grade is your average of test scores and you
want to know what grade to expect. We can find the average by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores.
In this case, there are six test scores. Thus,

                                               89 + 90 + 56 + 78 + 100 + 69 = 482  80.33.66

Therefore, your average test grade is approximately 80.33, which translates to a B- at most schools.

Suppose, however, that we have a function v(t) that gives us the speed of an object at any time t, and we want to find the
object's average speed. The function v(t) takes on an infinite number of values, so we can't use the process just described.
Fortunately, we can use a definite integral to find the average value of a function such as this.

Let  f (x)   be continuous over the interval         a, b    and let  a, b    be divided into n subintervals of width         x = (b - a)/n.

Choose a representative x*i          in each subinterval and calculate                 for     i = 1, 2,..., n.  In other words, consider each

                                                                              f x*i 

         as  a  sampling    of  the  function  over  each  subinterval.  The  average  value   of  the  function   may  then  be  approximated  as
       
f x*i

                                                                                          
                                                        f x*1  + f x*2  +  + f x*n 
                                                                         n                  ,

which is basically the same expression used to calculate the average of discrete values.

But we know     x        =  b - a,   so n = b - a,      and we get
                              n                x

                                                                                                                 
                                     f x*1  + f x*2  +  + f x*n  f x*1  + f x*2  +  + f x*n 
                                                     n                   = (b - a) .

                                                                                               x

Definition

Let  f (x)  be continuous over the interval    a, b.   Then, the average value of the function  f (x)  (or fave) on  a, b  is

given by

                                                                       b

                                                 fave = 1  f (x)dx.

     Example 5.14

       Finding the Average Value of a Linear Function

     Find the average value of  f (x) = x + 1    over the interval  0, 5.         

     Solution
     First, graph the function on the stated interval, as shown in Figure 5.25.

                                Figure 5.25 The graph shows the area under the function

                                f (x)  =  x+1    over         

                                                       0,  5.

     The region is a trapezoid lying on its side, so we can use the area formula for a trapezoid A = 1h(a + b), where
                                                                                                                 2

     h represents height, and a and b represent the two parallel sides. Then,

       5.3.1  Describe the meaning of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.
       5.3.2  State the meaning of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1.
       5.3.3  Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, to evaluate derivatives of integrals.

       5.3.5  Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, to evaluate definite integrals.
       5.3.6  Explain the relationship between differentiation and integration.

In the previous two sections, we looked at the definite integral and its relationship to the area under the curve of a function.
Unfortunately, so far, the only tools we have available to calculate the value of a definite integral are geometric area
formulas and limits of Riemann sums, and both approaches are extremely cumbersome. In this section we look at some
more powerful and useful techniques for evaluating definite integrals.

These new techniques rely on the relationship between differentiation and integration. This relationship was discovered and
explored by both Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (among others) during the late 1600s and early 1700s,
and it is codified in what we now call the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which has two parts that we examine in this
section. Its very name indicates how central this theorem is to the entire development of calculus.

       Isaac Newton's contributions to mathematics and physics changed the way we look at the world. The relationships
       he discovered, codified as Newton's laws and the law of universal gravitation, are still taught as foundational
       material in physics today, and his calculus has spawned entire fields of mathematics. To learn more, read a brief
       biography (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_newtonbio) of Newton with multimedia clips.

Before we get to this crucial theorem, however, let's examine another important theorem, the Mean Value Theorem for
Integrals, which is needed to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that a continuous function on a closed interval takes on its average value

at some point in that interval. The theorem guarantees that if  f (x)  is continuous, a point c exists in an interval  a, b  such

that the value of the function at c is equal to the average value of   f (x)  over    a, b.     We state this theorem mathematically

with the help of the formula for the average value of a function that we presented at the end of the preceding section.

Theorem 5.3: The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

If     f (x)  is continuous over an interval  a, b,  then there is at least one point      c             such that

                                                                                                a,  b

                                                f (c) = 1  b f (x)dx.                                                    (5.15)

                                                        b-a a

This formula can also be stated as

                                                      b f (x)dx = f (c)(b - a).

                                                       a

Proof

Since  f (x)  is continuous on           by the extreme value theorem (see Maxima and Minima), it assumes minimum and

                                a,  b,

maximum values--m and M, respectively--on                     Then, for all x in              we have m  f (x)  M. Therefore, by

                                                     a,  b.                       a,  b,

the comparison theorem (see The Definite Integral), we have

                                                m(b - a)   b f (x)dx  M(b - a).

                                                                    a
550                                                                                                      Chapter 5 | Integration

Dividing by b - a gives us

                            m  1  b f (x)dx  M.

                                  b-a a

Since 1  b f (x)dx is a number between m and M, and since f (x) is continuous and assumes the values m and M over

       b-a a

a, b,  by the Intermediate Value Theorem (see Continuity), there is a number c over           such that

                                                                                     a,  b

                            f (c) = 1  b f (x)dx,

                                    b-a a

and the proof is complete.


     Example 5.15

     Finding the Average Value of a Function

     Find the average value of the function f (x) = 8 - 2x over the interval [0, 4] and find c such that f (c) equals
     the average value of the function over [0, 4].

     Solution
     The formula states the mean value of f (x) is given by

                                            1  4(8 - 2x)dx.

                                                         4-0 0
     We can see in Figure 5.26 that the function represents a straight line and forms a right triangle bounded by the
     x- and y-axes. The area of the triangle is A = 1(base)height. We have

                                                          2

                                                           A = 1(4)(8) = 16.
                                                                2

     The average value is found by multiplying the area by 1/(4 - 0). Thus, the average value of the function is

                                                               1(16) = 4.

     Set the average value equal to f (c) and solve for c.

                            8 - 2c = 4
                                  c=2

     At c = 2, f (2) = 4.

                         Figure 5.26 By the Mean Value Theorem, the continuous
                         function f (x) takes on its average value at c at least once over

equals the average value of the function over [0, 6].

Example 5.16

  Finding the Point Where a Function Takes on Its Average Value

Given  3x2 dx = 9, find c such that f (c) equals the average value of f (x) = x2 over [0, 3].

             0

Solution
We are looking for the value of c such that

                                  f (c) = 1  3x2 dx = 1(9) = 3.3
                                             3-0 0

Replacing f (c) with c2, we have

                                             c2 = 3
                                             c = ± 3.

Since - 3 is outside the interval, take only the positive value. Thus, c = 3 (Figure 5.27).

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1: Integrals and
Antiderivatives

As mentioned earlier, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an extremely powerful theorem that establishes the
relationship between differentiation and integration, and gives us a way to evaluate definite integrals without using Riemann
sums or calculating areas. The theorem is comprised of two parts, the first of which, the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, Part 1, is stated here. Part 1 establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration.

Theorem 5.4: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1

If   f (x)  is continuous over an interval  a, b,  and the function F(x) is defined by

                                                   F(x) =  x f (t)dt,                                 (5.16)

                                                                 a

then  F (x)  =  f (x)  over         

                             a,  b.

Before we delve into the proof, a couple of subtleties are worth mentioning here. First, a comment on the notation. Note that
we have defined a function, F(x), as the definite integral of another function, f (t), from the point a to the point x. At
first glance, this is confusing, because we have said several times that a definite integral is a number, and here it looks like
it's a function. The key here is to notice that for any particular value of x, the definite integral is a number. So the function
F(x) returns a number (the value of the definite integral) for each value of x.

Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem. There is a reason it is called the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Not only does it establish a relationship between integration and differentiation, but
also it guarantees that any integrable function has an antiderivative. Specifically, it guarantees that any continuous function
has an antiderivative.

Proof

Applying the definition of the derivative, we have

                                               F (x)  = lim F(x + h) - F(x)h
                                                      h0

                                                              x+h                       x  
                                                      = lim 1 f (t)dt -  f (t)dt
                                                      h  0 h a                          a  

                                                              x+h                       a  
                                                      = lim 1 f (t)dt +  f (t)dt
                                                      h  0 h a                          x  

                                                      = lim 1 x + h f (t)dt.

                                                        h0h x

Looking carefully at this last expression, we see 1 x + h f (t)dt is just the average value of the function f (x) over the

                                                          hx

interval      x  +          Therefore, by The  Mean   Value  Theorem  for  Integrals, there is some number c in                      such

          x,        h.                                                                                           x,  x + h

that

                                                      1 x + h f (x)dx = f (c).

                                                      hx

In addition, since c is between x and x + h, c approaches x as h approaches zero. Also, since f (x) is continuous, we have

lim   f  (c)  =  lim     f  (c)  =  f (x).  Putting all these pieces together, we have
h0
                 cx

                                                      F (x)  = lim 1 x + h f (x)dx

                                                               h0h x
                                                             = lim f (c)

                                                                h0

                                                             = f (x),

and the proof is complete.

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2: The Evaluation Theorem

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, is perhaps the most important theorem in calculus. After tireless efforts
by mathematicians for approximately 500 years, new techniques emerged that provided scientists with the necessary tools
to explain many phenomena. Using calculus, astronomers could finally determine distances in space and map planetary
orbits. Everyday financial problems such as calculating marginal costs or predicting total profit could now be handled with
simplicity and accuracy. Engineers could calculate the bending strength of materials or the three-dimensional motion of
objects. Our view of the world was forever changed with calculus.

After finding approximate areas by adding the areas of n rectangles, the application of this theorem is straightforward by
comparison. It almost seems too simple that the area of an entire curved region can be calculated by just evaluating an
antiderivative at the first and last endpoints of an interval.

Theorem 5.5: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2

If f is continuous over the interval           and  F(x)  is any antiderivative of  f (x),  then

                                      a,  b

                                                b f (x)dx = F(b) - F(a).                          (5.17)

                                                 a

We often see the notation F(x)|ab to denote the expression F(b) - F(a). We use this vertical bar and associated limits a

and b to indicate that we should evaluate the function F(x) at the upper limit (in this case, b), and subtract the value of the
function F(x) evaluated at the lower limit (in this case, a).

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 (also known as the evaluation theorem) states that if we can find an

antiderivative for the integrand, then we can evaluate the definite integral by evaluating the antiderivative at the endpoints
of the interval and subtracting.

Proof

Let  P  =  {xi},  i  =  0,  1,..., n  be a regular partition of                  Then, we can write

                                                                      a,  b.

                     F(b) - F(a)      = F(xn) - F(x0)

                                      =           -  F(xn    -        +          -    1)    -  F(xn  -        +  ...  +           -              

                                         F (x n)                1)       F (x n                         2)               F (x 1)     F (x 0)

                                         n
                                                                           
                                      =              i)  -  F(x  i  -
                                              F(x                      1).

                                         i=1

Now, we know F is an antiderivative of f over                         so by the Mean Value Theorem (see The Mean Value Theorem)

                                                         a,  b,

for i = 0, 1,..., n we can find ci in [xi - 1, xi] such that

                                         F(xi) - F(xi - 1)          =  F     (c       i  -  xi - 1)  =  f (ci)x.

                                                                                 i(x

Then, substituting into the previous equation, we have

                                                                                            n

                                      F(b) - F(a) =  f (ci)x.

                                                                                          i=1

Taking the limit of both sides as n  , we obtain

                                                  F(b) - F(a)                           n

                                                                          = nlim  f (ci)x

                                                                                      i=1

                                                                          =  b f (x)dx.

                                                                                a

Analysis

Notice that we did not include the "+ C" term when we wrote the antiderivative. The reason is that, according
to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, any antiderivative works. So, for convenience, we chose the
antiderivative with C = 0. If we had chosen another antiderivative, the constant term would have canceled out.
This always happens when evaluating a definite integral.

The region of the area we just calculated is depicted in Figure 5.28. Note that the region between the curve
and the x-axis is all below the x-axis. Area is always positive, but a definite integral can still produce a negative
number (a net signed area). For example, if this were a profit function, a negative number indicates the company
is operating at a loss over the given interval.

                                   Figure 5.28 The evaluation of a definite integral can produce
                                   a negative value, even though area is always positive.

     First, eliminate the radical by rewriting the integral using rational exponents. Then, separate the numerator terms
     by writing each one over the denominator:

                                           9 x - 1dx =   x   9            1

                                           1                 1

     Use the properties of exponents to simplify:

                             x9                    1               9 x1/2 - x-1/2dx.

                             x1/2 x1/2          -     dx =                         
                                                                   1
                            1

     Now, integrate using the power rule:

Thus, James has skated 50 ft after 5 sec. Turning now to Kathy, we want to calculate

                                                                                                         cos t

Kathy has skated approximately 50.6 ft after 5 sec. Kathy wins, but not by much!

5.20 Suppose James and Kathy have a rematch, but this time the official stops the contest after only 3 sec.
Does this change the outcome?

  A Parachutist in Free Fall

         Figure 5.30 Skydivers can adjust the velocity of their dive by changing the position of their body during the
         free fall. (credit: Jeremy T. Lock)

   Julie is an avid skydiver. She has more than 300 jumps under her belt and has mastered the art of making adjustments
   to her body position in the air to control how fast she falls. If she arches her back and points her belly toward the
   ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec). If, instead, she orients her body with
   her head straight down, she falls faster, reaching a terminal velocity of 150 mph (220 ft/sec).
   Since Julie will be moving (falling) in a downward direction, we assume the downward direction is positive to simplify
   our calculations. Julie executes her jumps from an altitude of 12,500 ft. After she exits the aircraft, she immediately
  starts falling at a velocity given by v(t) = 32t. She continues to accelerate according to this velocity function until she
   reaches terminal velocity. After she reaches terminal velocity, her speed remains constant until she pulls her ripcord
   and slows down to land.
   On her first jump of the day, Julie orients herself in the slower "belly down" position (terminal velocity is 176 ft/sec).
   Using this information, answer the following questions.

       1. How long after she exits the aircraft does Julie reach terminal velocity?
       2. Based on your answer to question 1, set up an expression involving one or more integrals that represents the

            distance Julie falls after 30 sec.
       3. If Julie pulls her ripcord at an altitude of 3000 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall?
       4. Julie pulls her ripcord at 3000 ft. It takes 5 sec for her parachute to open completely and for her to slow down,

            during which time she falls another 400 ft. After her canopy is fully open, her speed is reduced to 16 ft/sec.
            Find the total time Julie spends in the air, from the time she leaves the airplane until the time her feet touch the
            ground.

     On Julie's second jump of the day, she decides she wants to fall a little faster and orients herself in the "head
     down" position. Her terminal velocity in this position is 220 ft/sec. Answer these questions based on this
     velocity:

5. How long does it take Julie to reach terminal velocity in this case?

6. Before pulling her ripcord, Julie reorients her body in the "belly down" position so she is not moving quite as
     fast when her parachute opens. If she begins this maneuver at an altitude of 4000 ft, how long does she spend
     in a free fall before beginning the reorientation?
     Some jumpers wear " wingsuits" (see Figure 5.31). These suits have fabric panels between the arms and legs
     and allow the wearer to glide around in a free fall, much like a flying squirrel. (Indeed, the suits are sometimes
     called "flying squirrel suits.") When wearing these suits, terminal velocity can be reduced to about 30 mph (44
     ft/sec), allowing the wearers a much longer time in the air. Wingsuit flyers still use parachutes to land; although
     the vertical velocities are within the margin of safety, horizontal velocities can exceed 70 mph, much too fast
     to land safely.

     Figure 5.31 The fabric panels on the arms and legs of a wingsuit work to reduce the vertical velocity of a
     skydiver's fall. (credit: Richard Schneider)

Answer the following question based on the velocity in a wingsuit.
    7. If Julie dons a wingsuit before her third jump of the day, and she pulls her ripcord at an altitude of 3000 ft, how
         long does she get to spend gliding around in the air?

point is called the aphelion (for Earth, it currently occurs    x(t)  =  A cost  -        where  is a phase constant,  is

planet, M is the mass of the Sun, G is a universal constant,

orbit. Assuming that M, m, and the ellipse parameters a

set up--but do not evaluate--an integral that expresses in
terms of G, m, M, a, b the average gravitational force

     5.4.1  Apply the basic integration formulas.
     5.4.2  Explain the significance of the net change theorem.
     5.4.3  Use the net change theorem to solve applied problems.
     5.4.4  Apply the integrals of odd and even functions.

In this section, we use some basic integration formulas studied previously to solve some key applied problems. It is
important to note that these formulas are presented in terms of indefinite integrals. Although definite and indefinite integrals
are closely related, there are some key differences to keep in mind. A definite integral is either a number (when the limits
of integration are constants) or a single function (when one or both of the limits of integration are variables). An indefinite
integral represents a family of functions, all of which differ by a constant. As you become more familiar with integration,
you will get a feel for when to use definite integrals and when to use indefinite integrals. You will naturally select the correct
approach for a given problem without thinking too much about it. However, until these concepts are cemented in your mind,
think carefully about whether you need a definite integral or an indefinite integral and make sure you are using the proper
notation based on your choice.

Basic Integration Formulas

Recall the integration formulas given in the table in Antiderivatives and the rule on properties of definite integrals. Let's
look at a few examples of how to apply these rules.

   Example 5.23

     Integrating a Function Using the Power Rule

     Use the power rule to integrate the function  4 t(1 + t)dt.

                                                                        1

     Solution
     The first step is to rewrite the function and simplify it so we can apply the power rule:

                                   4 t(1 + t)dt =  4t1/2(1 + t)dt
                                    1          1

                                               =  4t1/2 + t3/2dt.                   
                                               1

     Now apply the power rule:

             4t1/2 + t3/2dt            | = 2t3/2 + 2t5/2 43
            1                                  5 1

                                       = 2(4)3/2 + 2(4)5/2 - 2(1)3/2 + 2(1)5/2
                                       3       5  3                                   5

                                       = 256.

The Net Change Theorem

The net change theorem considers the integral of a rate of change. It says that when a quantity changes, the new value
equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change of that quantity. The formula can be expressed in two ways.
The second is more familiar; it is simply the definite integral.

Theorem 5.6: Net Change Theorem                                                                           (5.18)
The new value of a changing quantity equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change:

                                  F(b) = F(a) +  bF '(x)dx

                                                                                     a

                                                               or

                                   bF '(x)dx = F(b) - F(a).

                                                              a

Subtracting F(a) from both sides of the first equation yields the second equation. Since they are equivalent formulas, which
one we use depends on the application.

The significance of the net change theorem lies in the results. Net change can be applied to area, distance, and volume, to
name only a few applications. Net change accounts for negative quantities automatically without having to write more than
one integral. To illustrate, let's apply the net change theorem to a velocity function in which the result is displacement.

We looked at a simple example of this in The Definite Integral. Suppose a car is moving due north (the positive direction)
at 40 mph between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., then the car moves south at 30 mph between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. We can graph this
motion as shown in Figure 5.32.

                         Figure 5.32 The graph shows speed versus time for the given
                         motion of a car.

Just as we did before, we can use definite integrals to calculate the net displacement as well as the total distance traveled.
The net displacement is given by

                          5v(t)dt  45

                                   = 50.

Thus, at 5 p.m. the car is 50 mi north of its starting position. The total distance traveled is given by

Therefore, between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., the car traveled a total of 110 mi.

To summarize, net displacement may include both positive and negative values. In other words, the velocity function
accounts for both forward distance and backward distance. To find net displacement, integrate the velocity function over
the interval. Total distance traveled, on the other hand, is always positive. To find the total distance traveled by an object,
regardless of direction, we need to integrate the absolute value of the velocity function.

  Finding the Total Distance Traveled

Use Example 5.24 to find the total distance traveled by a particle according to the velocity function
v(t) = 3t - 5 m/sec over a time interval [0, 3].

Solution

The total distance traveled includes both the positive and the negative values. Therefore, we must integrate the
absolute value of the velocity function to find the total distance traveled.

To continue with the example, use two integrals to find the total distance. First, find the t-intercept of the function,
since that is where the division of the interval occurs. Set the equation equal to zero and solve for t. Thus,

                                       3t - 5 = 0
                                           3t = 5
                                             t = 5.
                                                     3

                          5  5 
The two subintervals are 0,  and  , 3. To find the total distance traveled, integrate the absolute value of33

                                                                        53          we have |v(t)| = -v(t) over that interval.
the function. Since the function is negative over the interval 0, ,

       5 3               the function is positive, so |v(t)| = v(t). Thus, we have

Applying the Net Change Theorem

The net change theorem can be applied to the flow and consumption of fluids, as shown in Example 5.26.

   Example 5.26

     How Many Gallons of Gasoline Are Consumed?

     If the motor on a motorboat is started at t = 0 and the boat consumes gasoline at 5 - t3 gal/hr for the first hour,
     how much gasoline is used in the first hour?

     Solution

     Express the problem as a definite integral, integrate, and evaluate using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
     The limits of integration are the endpoints of the interval [0, 1]. We have

           1 3                                 |  t4 1

                                                       4

                                               = 4.75.

  Thus, the motorboat uses 4.75 gal of gas in 1 hour.

  Chapter Opener: Iceboats

                         Figure 5.34 (credit: modification of work by Carter Brown,
                         Flickr)

As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, top iceboat racers (Figure 5.1) can attain speeds of up to five times the
wind speed. Andrew is an intermediate iceboater, though, so he attains speeds equal to only twice the wind speed.
Suppose Andrew takes his iceboat out one morning when a light 5-mph breeze has been blowing all morning. As
Andrew gets his iceboat set up, though, the wind begins to pick up. During his first half hour of iceboating, the
wind speed increases according to the function v(t) = 20t + 5. For the second half hour of Andrew's outing, the

wind remains steady at 15 mph. In other words, the wind speed is given by

                         20t + 5 for 0  t  1
                         v(t) =                                       2

Recalling that Andrew's iceboat travels at twice the wind speed, and assuming he moves in a straight line away
from his starting point, how far is Andrew from his starting point after 1 hour?

Solution
To figure out how far Andrew has traveled, we need to integrate his velocity, which is twice the wind speed. Then

Distance =  12v(t)dt.

                     0

Substituting the expressions we were given for v(t), we get

                = 25.

     Andrew is 25 mi from his starting point after 1 hour.

     5.23 Suppose that, instead of remaining steady during the second half hour of Andrew's outing, the wind
     starts to die down according to the function v(t) = -10t + 15. In other words, the wind speed is given by

                   20t + 5 for 0  t  1                                                               2
     v(t) =

                                                                                        2

     Under these conditions, how far from his starting point is Andrew after 1 hour?

Integrating Even and Odd Functions

We saw in Functions and Graphs that an even function is a function in which f (-x) = f (x) for all x in the
domain--that is, the graph of the curve is unchanged when x is replaced with -x. The graphs of even functions are
symmetric about the y-axis. An odd function is one in which f (-x) = - f (x) for all x in the domain, and the graph of the
function is symmetric about the origin.

Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from -a to a, involve two equal areas, because they are
symmetric about the y-axis. Integrals of odd functions, when the limits of integration are similarly [-a, a], evaluate to
zero because the areas above and below the x-axis are equal.

To verify the integration formula for even functions, we can calculate the integral from 0 to 2 and double it, then
check to make sure we get the same answer.

                                  Learning Objectives

     5.5.1 Use substitution to evaluate indefinite integrals.
     5.5.2 Use substitution to evaluate definite integrals.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gave us a method to evaluate integrals without using Riemann sums. The drawback
of this method, though, is that we must be able to find an antiderivative, and this is not always easy. In this section we
examine a technique, called integration by substitution, to help us find antiderivatives. Specifically, this method helps us
find antiderivatives when the integrand is the result of a chain-rule derivative.

At first, the approach to the substitution procedure may not appear very obvious. However, it is primarily a visual task--that
is, the integrand shows you what to do; it is a matter of recognizing the form of the function. So, what are we supposed to

                                                                                                          2 3
see? We are looking for an integrand of the form f g(x)g (x)dx. For example, in the integral x - 3 2xdx, we have

                                                                                                         

f (x) = x3, g(x) = x2 - 3, and g '(x) = 2x. Then,

                                                                         2 3
                                     f g(x)g (x) = x - 3 (2x),

and we see that our integrand is in the correct form.

The method is called substitution because we substitute part of the integrand with the variable u and part of the integrand
with du. It is also referred to as change of variables because we are changing variables to obtain an expression that is easier
to work with for applying the integration rules.

  Theorem 5.7: Substitution with Indefinite Integrals

  Let u = g(x), , where g (x) is continuous over an interval, let f (x) be continuous over the corresponding range of
  g, and let F(x) be an antiderivative of f (x). Then,

                                  f      x         (  x  )d  x       =  f (u)du                                (5.19)

                                     g(     )g

                                                                     = F(u) + C

                                                                     =     Fg(x)           +  C.

Proof                                                               = F (g(x)g (x)

Let f, g, u, and F be as specified in the theorem. Then             =      f        x      (  x  ).
                                                      d F(g(x))
                                                      dx                      g(       )g

Integrating both sides with respect to x, we see that

                                         f      x        (       x  )d  x  =        Fg(x)     +      C.

                                            g(     )g

If we now substitute u = g(x),  and du = g '(x)dx, we get

                                       f      x          (  x    )d  x        =  f (u)du

                                          g(     )g

                                                                              = F(u) + C

                                                                              =     Fg(x)        +   C.

Returning to the problem we looked at originally, we let u = x2 - 3 and then du = 2xdx. Rewrite the integral in terms of
u:

                                             x2 - 3    3

                                                          (2xdx) =  u3 du.
                                             u            
                                                          du
                                               
                                             

Using the power rule for integrals, we have

                                                   u3 du = u4 + C.4
                                                   

Substitute the original expression for x back into the solution:

                                                           2 4
                                               u4         x - 3
                                                 4 + C = 4 + C.

We can generalize the procedure in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Integration by Substitution

    1. Look carefully at the integrand and select an expression g(x) within the integrand to set equal to u. Let's select
         g(x). such that g (x) is also part of the integrand.

    2. Substitute u = g(x) and du = g (x)dx. into the integral.

    3. We should now be able to evaluate the integral with respect to u. If the integral can't be evaluated we need to
         go back and select a different expression to use as u.

    4. Evaluate the integral in terms of u.
    5. Write the result in terms of x and the expression g(x).

  Using Substitution to Find an Antiderivative

                                                  2 4
Use substitution to find the antiderivative 6x3x + 4 dx.

                                                

Solution

The first step is to choose an expression for u. We choose u = 3x2 + 4 because then du = 6xdx, and we
already have du in the integrand. Write the integral in terms of u:

                                               2 4                   4
                                             6x3x + 4 dx =  u du.
                                             

Remember that du is the derivative of the expression chosen for u, regardless of what is inside the integrand. Now
we can evaluate the integral with respect to u:

                                        u4 du = u5 + C

                                                                    5

                                                                                    2 5

                                                                   3x + 4
                                                                = 5 + C.
     Analysis
     We can check our answer by taking the derivative of the result of integration. We should obtain the integrand.
                                                 1 2 5
     Picking a value for C of 1, we let y = 3x + 4 + 1. We have
                                                 5
                                                              1 2 5
                                                         y = 3x + 4 + 1,

     so

                                                               1  2 4
                                                       y =  53x + 4 6x

                                                                5

                                                            = 6x3x + 4 .

     This is exactly the expression we started with inside the integrand.

Sometimes we need to adjust the constants in our integral if they don't match up exactly with the expressions we are
substituting.

   Example 5.31

     Using Substitution with Alteration

     Use substitution to find  z z2 - 5dz.

     Solution

                 2 1/2                         2
     Rewrite the integral as zz - 5 dz. Let u = z - 5 and du = 2z dz. Now we have a problem because
               

     du = 2z dz and the original expression has only z dz. We have to alter our expression for du or the integral in

     u will be twice as large as it should be. If we multiply both sides of the du equation by 1. we can solve this
                                                                                                              2

     problem. Thus,

                                               u = z2 - 5

                                               du = 2z dz

                                            21du = 1(2z)dz = z dz.2

Use substitution to evaluate the integral  sin t dt.

Solution                                       so we set u = cos t. Then du = -sin tdt. Substituting into the

We know the derivative of cos t is -sin t,
integral, we have

                                                sint dt = -du.
                                               cos3 t  u 3

                                     -du = - u-3 du

                                       u 3

Sometimes we need to manipulate an integral in ways that are more complicated than just multiplying or dividing by a
constant. We need to eliminate all the expressions within the integrand that are in terms of the original variable. When we
are done, u should be the only variable in the integrand. In some cases, this means solving for the original variable in terms
of u. This technique should become clear in the next example.

   Example 5.33

     Finding an Antiderivative Using u-Substitution

     Use substitution to find the antiderivative  x dx.

                                                          x-1

     Solution

     If we let u = x - 1, then du = dx. But this does not account for the x in the numerator of the integrand. We
     need to express x in terms of u. If u = x - 1, then x = u + 1. Now we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:

        x dx =  u + 1du                                                           u
       x-1

                         =  u + 1 du

                                      u

                         =  u1/2 + u-1/2du.                                                  

     Then we integrate in the usual way, replace u with the original expression, and factor and simplify the result.
     Thus,

      u1/2 + u-1/2du  = 2u3/2 + 2u1/2 + C

Substitution for Definite Integrals

Substitution can be used with definite integrals, too. However, using substitution to evaluate a definite integral requires a
change to the limits of integration. If we change variables in the integrand, the limits of integration change as well.

Theorem 5.8: Substitution with Definite Integrals

Let   u = g(x)  and let  g  be continuous over an interval                          and let f be continuous over the range of u = g(x).

                                                                     a,      b,

Then,

                                          b                                       g(b)

                                               f      x      (  x  )d  x   =      g(a)  f (u)du.

                                                  g(     )g

                                          a

Although we will not formally prove this theorem, we justify it with some calculations here. From the substitution rule for
indefinite integrals, if F(x) is an antiderivative of f (x), we have

                                               f      x      (  x  )d   x  =  Fg(x)        +  C.

                                                  g(     )g

Then

                                          b                        =    Fg(x)| xx   =      b                            (5.20)

                                                                   = F(u)|u = g(a) u = g(b)

                                                                          g(b)

and we have the desired result.

      Solution

      Let u = 1 + 2x3, so du = 6x2 dx. Since the original function includes one factor of x2 and du = 6x2 dx,
      multiply both sides of the du equation by 1/6. Then,

      To adjust the limits of integration,               du = 6x2 dx                          x = 0, u = 1 + 2(0) = 1,  and when
      x = 1, u = 1 + 2(1) = 3. Then                      1du = x2 dx.

     Solution

     Let u = 4x3 + 3. Then, du = 8xdx. To adjust the limits of integration, we note that when x = 0, u = 3, and
     when x = 1, u = 7. So our substitution gives

Substitution may be only one of the techniques needed to evaluate a definite integral. All of the properties and rules of
integration apply independently, and trigonometric functions may need to be rewritten using a trigonometric identity before
we can apply substitution. Also, we have the option of replacing the original expression for u after we find the antiderivative,
which means that we do not have to change the limits of integration. These two approaches are shown in Example 5.36.

Use substitution to evaluate  /2cos2  d.

                                            0

Solution

Let us first use a trigonometric identity to rewrite the integral. The trig identity cos2  = 1 + cos 2 allows us
                                                                                                              2

to rewrite the integral as

                              /2cos2 d = /21 + cos 2d.    2
                             0                 0

Then,

                            /21 + cos 2d = /21 + 1cos 2d

                                               = 1 /2d + 1 /2cos2d.
                                               20            20

We can evaluate the first integral as it is, but we need to make a substitution to evaluate the second integral. Let

u = 2. Then, du = 2d, or 1du = d. Also, when  = 0, u = 0, and when  = /2, u = . Expressing
                                     2

the second integral in terms of u, we have

                             /2 /2             = 1    /2 d + 11

         5.6.1 Integrate functions involving exponential functions.
         5.6.2 Integrate functions involving logarithmic functions.

Exponential and logarithmic functions are used to model population growth, cell growth, and financial growth, as well as
depreciation, radioactive decay, and resource consumption, to name only a few applications. In this section, we explore
integration involving exponential and logarithmic functions.

Integrals of Exponential Functions

The exponential function is perhaps the most efficient function in terms of the operations of calculus. The exponential
function, y = ex, is its own derivative and its own integral.

Rule: Integrals of Exponential Functions                                 (5.21)
Exponential functions can be integrated using the following formulas.

                                     exdx = ex + C
                                     axdx = ax + C

                                                                   ln a

Example 5.37

Finding an Antiderivative of an Exponential Function

Find the antiderivative of the exponential function e-x.

Solution                           and then du = -1dx. Multiply the du equation by -1, so you now have

Use substitution, setting u = -x,
-du = dx. Then,

                                    e-xdx                 = - eu du

                                                          = -eu + C
                                                          = -e-x + C.

        5.31 Find the antiderivative of the function using substitution: x2 e-2x3.

A common mistake when dealing with exponential expressions is treating the exponent on e the same way we treat
exponents in polynomial expressions. We cannot use the power rule for the exponent on e. This can be especially confusing
when we have both exponentials and polynomials in the same expression, as in the previous checkpoint. In these cases, we
should always double-check to make sure we're using the right rules for the functions we're integrating.

     Example 5.38

       Square Root of an Exponential Function

     Find the antiderivative of the exponential function ex 1 + ex.

     Solution
     First rewrite the problem using a rational exponent:

              ex 1 + exdx =  ex (1 + ex)1/2 dx.

     Using substitution, choose u = 1 + ex.u = 1 + ex. Then, du = ex dx. We have (Figure 5.37)

              ex (1 + ex)1/2 dx =  u1/2 du.

     Then

           u1/2 du = u3/2 + C = 2u3/2 + C = 2(1 + ex)3/2 + C.

   Example 5.39

     Using Substitution with an Exponential Function

    Use substitution to evaluate the indefinite integral  3x2 e2x3 dx.

     Solution
     Here we choose to let u equal the expression in the exponent on e. Let u = 2x3 and du = 6x2 dx.. Again, du
      is off by a constant multiplier; the original function contains a factor of 3x2, not 6x2. Multiply both sides of the
     equation by 1 so that the integrand in u equals the integrand in x. Thus,

                     2

                                        3x2 e2x3dx = 1 eu du.

                                                                           2

Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in x back into the u integral:

                         21 eudu = 1eu + C = 1e2x3 + C.22

      5.33 Evaluate the indefinite integral  2x3 ex4 dx.

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, exponential functions are used in many real-life applications. The number e is
often associated with compounded or accelerating growth, as we have seen in earlier sections about the derivative. Although
the derivative represents a rate of change or a growth rate, the integral represents the total change or the total growth. Let's
look at an example in which integration of an exponential function solves a common business application.
A price-demand function tells us the relationship between the quantity of a product demanded and the price of the product.
In general, price decreases as quantity demanded increases. The marginal price-demand function is the derivative of the
price-demand function and it tells us how fast the price changes at a given level of production. These functions are used in
business to determine the price-elasticity of demand, and to help companies determine whether changing production levels
would be profitable.

   Example 5.40

     Finding a Price-Demand Equation

      Find the price-demand equation for a particular brand of toothpaste at a supermarket chain when the demand is
     50 tubes per week at $2.35 per tube, given that the marginal price--demand function, p (x), for x number of
      tubes per week, is given as

                                                         p '(x) = -0.015e-0.01x.
      If the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it set?

     Solution
      To find the price-demand equation, integrate the marginal price-demand function. First find the antiderivative,
      then look at the particulars. Thus,

                                      p(x) =  -0.015e-0.01x dx
                                           = -0.015 e-0.01xdx.

     Using substitution, let u = -0.01x and du = -0.01dx. Then, divide both sides of the du equation by -0.01.
      This gives

                                   -0.015 eu du = 1.5 eu du

                                                  -0.01
                                                                      = 1.5eu + C
                                                                      = 1.5e-0.01x + C.

      The next step is to solve for C. We know that when the price is $2.35 per tube, the demand is 50 tubes per week.
      This means
598                                                                                     Chapter 5 | Integration

                                p(50) = 1.5e-0.01(50) + C
                                        = 2.35.

     Now, just solve for C:

                                                         C = 2.35 - 1.5e-0.5
                                                             = 2.35 - 0.91
                                                             = 1.44.

     Thus,

                                                      p(x) = 1.5e-0.01x + 1.44.

     If the supermarket sells 100 tubes of toothpaste per week, the price would be

                                p(100) = 1.5e-0.01(100) + 1.44 = 1.5e-1 + 1.44  1.99.

     The supermarket should charge $1.99 per tube if it is selling 100 tubes per week.

       Evaluating a Definite Integral Involving an Exponential Function

     Evaluate the definite integral  2e1 - x dx.

                                                   1

     Solution                                                                                             Then
     Again, substitution is the method to use. Let u = 1 - x, so du = -1dx or -du = dx.

      e1 - x dx = - eu du. Next, change the limits of integration. Using the equation u = 1 - x, we have

                                                         u = 1 - (1) = 0
                                                         u = 1 - (2) = -1.

     The integral then becomes

                                 2e1 - x dx = - -1eu du
                                                      1                           0

                                                         =  0 eu du

  Growth of Bacteria in a Culture

Suppose the rate of growth of bacteria in a Petri dish is given by q(t) = 3t, where t is given in hours and q(t)
is given in thousands of bacteria per hour. If a culture starts with 10,000 bacteria, find a function Q(t) that gives
the number of bacteria in the Petri dish at any time t. How many bacteria are in the dish after 2 hours?

Solution
We have

                                   Q(t) = 3t dt = 3t + C.
                                     ln 3

Then, at t = 0 we have Q(0) = 10 = 1 + C, so C  9.090 and we get
                                             ln 3
                                                    Q(t) = 3t + 9.090.
                                                             ln 3

At time t = 2, we have

                                                    Q(2) = 32 + 9.090
                                                              ln 3

                                                           = 17.282.

After 2 hours, there are 17,282 bacteria in the dish.

5.35 From Example 5.42, suppose the bacteria grow at a rate of q(t) = 2t. Assume the culture still starts
with 10,000 bacteria. Find Q(t). How many bacteria are in the dish after 3 hours?

       Fruit Fly Population Growth

     Suppose a population of fruit flies increases at a rate of g(t) = 2e0.02t, in flies per day. If the initial population
     of fruit flies is 100 flies, how many flies are in the population after 10 days?

     Solution
     Let G(t) represent the number of flies in the population at time t. Applying the net change theorem, we have

                                           G(10)  = G(0) +  102e0.02t dt

                                                                    0

                                                  = 100 +  2 e0.02t 10

                                                  | = 100 + 100e0.2 - 100
                                                  = 100 + 100e  0

                                                   122.

     There are 122 flies in the population after 10 days.

     5.36 Suppose the rate of growth of the fly population is given by g(t) = e0.01t, and the initial fly population
     is 100 flies. How many flies are in the population after 15 days?

       Evaluating a Definite Integral Using Substitution

                                                                              2 1/x

     Evaluate the definite integral using substitution:  e1 x2 dx.

     Solution
     This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a
     power of x, then bring the x2 in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent. We have

                                           2e1/x 2 2 dx =  ex-1 x-2 dx.
                                           1 x             1

     Let u = x-1, the exponent on e. Then

                                                    du = -x-2 dx
                                                  -du = x-2 dx.

     Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads

Chapter 5 | Integration                                                                                      601

                                                     - eu du.

Next, change the limits of integration:

                                                     u = (1)-1 = 1
                                                     u = (2)-1 = 1.

                                                                    2

Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by -1 and interchange the
limits. Thus,

                                         - 1/2eu du =  1 eu du
                                         1                     1/2

                                                     = eu |11/2

                                                     = e - e1/2
                                                     = e - e.

Integrals Involving Logarithmic Functions

Integrating functions of the form f (x) = x-1 result in the absolute value of the natural log function, as shown in the
following rule. Integral formulas for other logarithmic functions, such as f (x) = ln x and f (x) = loga x, are also included
in the rule.

Find the definite integral of  sin x dx.
                                0 1 + cos x

Solution

We need substitution to evaluate this problem. Let u = 1 + cos x, ,        so du = -sin x dx. Rewrite the integral in
terms of u, changing the limits of integration as well. Thus,

                                               u = 1 + cos(0) = 2
                                                           cos    
                                               u  =  1  +      2    =  1.

      Then

            /2 sin x = - 1u-1 du
            0 1 + cos x                                                           2

                         =  2u-1 du

                               1

                         = ln|u||12

                         = [ln2 - ln1]

                         = ln2.

         5.7.1 Integrate functions resulting in inverse trigonometric functions

In this section we focus on integrals that result in inverse trigonometric functions. We have worked with these functions
before. Recall from Functions and Graphs that trigonometric functions are not one-to-one unless the domains are
restricted. When working with inverses of trigonometric functions, we always need to be careful to take these restrictions
into account. Also in Derivatives, we developed formulas for derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions. The formulas
developed there give rise directly to integration formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions.

Integrals that Result in Inverse Sine Functions

Let us begin this last section of the chapter with the three formulas. Along with these formulas, we use substitution to
evaluate the integrals. We prove the formula for the inverse sine integral.

Rule: Integration Formulas Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The following integration formulas yield inverse trigonometric functions:

Proof

Let  y  =   sin-1 x.  Then  asin y  =  x.  Now let's use implicit differentiation. We obtain
                   a

Integrals Resulting in Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions

There are six inverse trigonometric functions. However, only three integration formulas are noted in the rule on integration
formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions because the remaining three are negative versions of the ones we use.
The only difference is whether the integrand is positive or negative. Rather than memorizing three more formulas, if the
integrand is negative, simply factor out -1 and evaluate the integral using one of the formulas already provided. To close
this section, we examine one more formula: the integral resulting in the inverse tangent function.

  Finding an Antiderivative Involving the Inverse Tangent Function

Find an antiderivative of  1 1 + 4x2dx.

Solution

Comparing this problem with the formulas stated in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse
trigonometric functions, the integrand looks similar to the formula for tan-1 u + C. So we use substitution,
letting u = 2x, then du = 2dx and 1/2du = dx. Then, we have

                         1 1 du = 1 tan-1 u + C = 1 tan-1 (2x) + C.

CHAPTER 5 REVIEW

KEY TERMS

average value of a function (or fave) the average value of a function on an interval can be found by calculating the
       definite integral of the function and dividing that value by the length of the interval

change of variables the substitution of a variable, such as u, for an expression in the integrand

definite integral a primary operation of calculus; the area between the curve and the x-axis over a given interval is a
       definite integral

fundamental theorem of calculus the theorem, central to the entire development of calculus, that establishes the
       relationship between differentiation and integration

fundamental theorem of calculus, part 1 uses a definite integral to define an antiderivative of a function

fundamental theorem of calculus, part 2 (also, evaluation theorem) we can evaluate a definite integral by
       evaluating the antiderivative of the integrand at the endpoints of the interval and subtracting

integrable function a function is integrable if the limit defining the integral exists; in other words, if the limit of the
       Riemann sums as n goes to infinity exists

integrand the function to the right of the integration symbol; the integrand includes the function being integrated

integration by substitution a technique for integration that allows integration of functions that are the result of a
       chain-rule derivative

left-endpoint approximation an approximation of the area under a curve computed by using the left endpoint of each
       subinterval to calculate the height of the vertical sides of each rectangle

limits of integration these values appear near the top and bottom of the integral sign and define the interval over which
       the function should be integrated

lower sum a sum obtained by using the minimum value of f (x) on each subinterval

mean value theorem for integrals guarantees that a point c exists such that f (c) is equal to the average value of the
       function

net change theorem if we know the rate of change of a quantity, the net change theorem says the future quantity is
       equal to the initial quantity plus the integral of the rate of change of the quantity

net signed area the area between a function and the x-axis such that the area below the x-axis is subtracted from the area
       above the x-axis; the result is the same as the definite integral of the function

partition a set of points that divides an interval into subintervals

regular partition a partition in which the subintervals all have the same width

riemann sum                                                                       n
             an estimate of the area under the curve of the form A   f (x*i )x
                                                                                  i=1

right-endpoint approximation the right-endpoint approximation is an approximation of the area of the rectangles
       under a curve using the right endpoint of each subinterval to construct the vertical sides of each rectangle

sigma notation (also, summation notation) the Greek letter sigma () indicates addition of the values; the values of the
       index above and below the sigma indicate where to begin the summation and where to end it

total area total area between a function and the x-axis is calculated by adding the area above the x-axis and the area
       below the x-axis; the result is the same as the definite integral of the absolute value of the function

upper sum a sum obtained by using the maximum value of f (x) on each subinterval

variable of integration indicates which variable you are integrating with respect to; if it is x, then the function in the
       integrand is followed by dx

5.2 The Definite Integral

     · The definite integral can be used to calculate net signed area, which is the area above the x-axis less the area below
         the x-axis. Net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero.

     · The component parts of the definite integral are the integrand, the variable of integration, and the limits of
         integration.

     · Continuous functions on a closed interval are integrable. Functions that are not continuous may still be integrable,
         depending on the nature of the discontinuities.

     · The properties of definite integrals can be used to evaluate integrals.
     · The area under the curve of many functions can be calculated using geometric formulas.
     · The average value of a function can be calculated using definite integrals.

5.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

     · The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that for a continuous function over a closed interval, there is a value c
         such that f (c) equals the average value of the function. See The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.

     · The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1 shows the relationship between the derivative and the integral. See
         Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1.

     · The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 is a formula for evaluating a definite integral in terms of an
         antiderivative of its integrand. The total area under a curve can be found using this formula. See The
         Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2.

5.4 Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem

     · The net change theorem states that when a quantity changes, the final value equals the initial value plus the integral
         of the rate of change. Net change can be a positive number, a negative number, or zero.

     · The area under an even function over a symmetric interval can be calculated by doubling the area over the positive
         x-axis. For an odd function, the integral over a symmetric interval equals zero, because half the area is negative.

5.5 Substitution

     · Substitution is a technique that simplifies the integration of functions that are the result of a chain-rule derivative.
         The term `substitution' refers to changing variables or substituting the variable u and du for appropriate expressions
         in the integrand.

     · When using substitution for a definite integral, we also have to change the limits of integration.

         decay.

     · Substitution is often used to evaluate integrals involving exponential functions or logarithms.

5.7 Integrals Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions

     · Formulas for derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions developed in Derivatives of Exponential and
         Logarithmic Functions lead directly to integration formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions.

     · Use the formulas listed in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions to match up
         the correct format and make alterations as necessary to solve the problem.

     · Substitution is often required to put the integrand in the correct form.

Introduction

The Hoover Dam is an engineering marvel. When Lake Mead, the reservoir behind the dam, is full, the dam withstands a
great deal of force. However, water levels in the lake vary considerably as a result of droughts and varying water demands.
Later in this chapter, we use definite integrals to calculate the force exerted on the dam when the reservoir is full and we
examine how changing water levels affect that force (see Example 6.28).

Hydrostatic force is only one of the many applications of definite integrals we explore in this chapter. From geometric
applications such as surface area and volume, to physical applications such as mass and work, to growth and decay models,
definite integrals are a powerful tool to help us understand and model the world around us.

6.1 | Areas between Curves

                                  Learning Objectives

     6.1.1 Determine the area of a region between two curves by integrating with respect to the
     independent variable.
     6.1.2 Find the area of a compound region.
     6.1.3 Determine the area of a region between two curves by integrating with respect to the
     dependent variable.

In Introduction to Integration, we developed the concept of the definite integral to calculate the area below a curve on
a given interval. In this section, we expand that idea to calculate the area of more complex regions. We start by finding the
area between two curves that are functions of x, beginning with the simple case in which one function value is always

greater than the other. We then look at cases when the graphs of the functions cross. Last, we consider how to calculate the
area between two curves that are functions of y.

Area of a Region between Two Curves

Let  f (x)  and  g(x)  be continuous functions over an interval  a, b               such that  f (x)  g(x)  on  a, b.  We want to find the

area between the graphs of the functions, as shown in the following figure.

                       Figure 6.2 The area between the graphs of two functions,
                        f (x) and g(x), on the interval [a, b].

As we did before, we are going to partition the interval on the x-axis and approximate the area between the graphs

of the functions with rectangles. So, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n,      let              P = {xi}   be a regular partition of  a, b.  Then, for

i = 1, 2,..., n, choose a point x*i  [xi - 1, xi], and on each interval [xi - 1, xi] construct a rectangle that extends

vertically from g(x*i ) to f (x*i ). Figure 6.3(a) shows the rectangles when x*i is selected to be the left endpoint of the

interval and n = 10. Figure 6.3(b) shows a representative rectangle in detail.

     Use this calculator (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_CurveCalc) to learn more about the areas between two
     curves.

                                         Figure 6.3 (a)We can approximate the area between the
                                         graphs of two functions, f (x) and g(x), with rectangles. (b)

                                         The area of a typical rectangle goes from one curve to the other.

The height of each individual rectangle is f (x*i ) - g(x*i ) and the width of each rectangle is x. Adding the areas of all
the rectangles, we see that the area between the curves is approximated by

Theorem 6.1: Finding the Area between Two Curves

Let  f (x)  and  g(x)  be continuous functions such that                 f (x)  g(x)        over an interval  a, b.        Let  R  denote the region

bounded above by the graph of f (x), below by the graph of g(x), and on the left and right by the lines x = a and

x = b, respectively. Then, the area of R is given by

                                                                 b               g(x)d                                             (6.1)

We apply this theorem in the following example.

Solution
The region is depicted in the following figure.

                                         Figure 6.5 This graph shows the region below the graph of
                                          f (x) and above the graph of g(x).

We first need to compute where the graphs of the functions intersect. Setting f (x) = g(x), we get

                                                            f (x) = g(x)

                                                        36 - x2 = 24 - 4x
                                                 x2 - 4x - 12 = 0
                                                (x - 6)(x + 2) = 0.

The graphs of the functions intersect when x = 6 or x = -2, so we want to integrate from -2 to 6. Since
 f (x)  g(x) for -2  x  6, we obtain

Areas of Compound Regions

So far, we have required f (x)  g(x) over the entire interval of interest, but what if we want to look at regions bounded by
the graphs of functions that cross one another? In that case, we modify the process we just developed by using the absolute
value function.

Theorem 6.2: Finding the Area of a Region between Curves That Cross

Let  f (x)  and  g(x)  be continuous functions over an interval  a, b.   Let      R  denote the region between the graphs of

     f (x) and g(x), and be bounded on the left and right by the lines x = a and x = b, respectively. Then, the area of

R is given by

                                 b

                           | f (x) - g(x)|dx.

                       A= a

In practice, applying this theorem requires us to break up the interval           and evaluate several integrals, depending on

                                                                         a,  b

which of the function values is greater over a given part of the interval. We study this process in the following example.

     Example 6.3

Solution

As with Example 6.3, we need to divide the interval into two pieces. The graphs of the functions intersect at
x = 1 (set f (x) = g(x) and solve for x), so we evaluate two separate integrals: one over the interval [0, 1] and
one over the interval [1, 2].

Over the interval [0, 1], the region is bounded above by f (x) = x2 and below by the x-axis, so we have

                                                            | A1 =  x1 2 dx = x 0 3 = 1 1.

     Adding these areas together, we obtain

                                             A = A1 + A2 = 1 + 1 = 5.

     The area of the region is 5/6 units2.

     6.4 Consider the region depicted in the following figure. Find the area of R.

Regions Defined with Respect to y

In Example 6.4, we had to evaluate two separate integrals to calculate the area of the region. However, there is another
approach that requires only one integral. What if we treat the curves as functions of y, instead of as functions of x ?

Review Figure 6.7. Note that the left graph, shown in red, is represented by the function y = f (x) = x2. We could just
as easily solve this for x and represent the curve by the function x = v(y) = y. (Note that x = - y is also a valid

representation of the function y = f (x) = x2 as a function of y. However, based on the graph, it is clear we are interested
in the positive square root.) Similarly, the right graph is represented by the function y = g(x) = 2 - x, but could just as
easily be represented by the function x = u(y) = 2 - y. When the graphs are represented as functions of y, we see the
region is bounded on the left by the graph of one function and on the right by the graph of the other function. Therefore, if
we integrate with respect to y, we need to evaluate one integral only. Let's develop a formula for this type of integration.

Let  u(y)  and  v(y)  be continuous functions over an interval  c, d  such that  u(y)  v(y)       for all  y  c, d.  We want to

find the area between the graphs of the functions, as shown in the following figure.

                                       Figure 6.8 We can find the area between the graphs of two
                                   functions, u(y) and v(y).

This time, we are going to partition the interval on the y-axis and use horizontal rectangles to approximate the area between

the functions. So, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n,  let  Q  =   {yi}  be a regular partition of              Then, for  i   =  1,  2,...,  n,  choose

     Let's revisit Example 6.4, only this time let's integrate with respect to y. Let R be the region depicted in
     Figure 6.10. Find the area of R by integrating with respect to y.

                                 Figure 6.10 The area of region R can be calculated using
                                 one integral only when the curves are treated as functions of y.

     Solution

     We must first express the graphs as functions of y. As we saw at the beginning of this section, the curve on
     the left can be represented by the function x = v(y) = y, and the curve on the right can be represented by the
     function x = u(y) = 2 - y.

     Now we have to determine the limits of integration. The region is bounded below by the x-axis, so the lower limit

     of integration is y = 0. The upper limit of integration is determined by the point where the two graphs intersect,

     which is the point (1, 1),  so the upper limit of integration is               y = 1.       Thus, we have           =  [0,  1].

                                                                                                                c,  d

     Calculating the area of the region, we get

                                             d

                                       u(y) - v(y)dy

                                 A= c

                                 =   0 2 - y -                                                   - 2 y3/2
                                                        =                           2y  -
                                                   ydy                                     2 3 0

                                 = 5.
                                    6

     The area of the region is 5/6 units2.

6.2 | Determining Volumes by Slicing

                                     Learning Objectives

        6.2.1 Determine the volume of a solid by integrating a cross-section (the slicing method).
        6.2.2 Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the disk method.
        6.2.3 Find the volume of a solid of revolution with a cavity using the washer method.

In the preceding section, we used definite integrals to find the area between two curves. In this section, we use definite
integrals to find volumes of three-dimensional solids. We consider three approaches--slicing, disks, and washers--for
finding these volumes, depending on the characteristics of the solid.

Volume and the Slicing Method

Just as area is the numerical measure of a two-dimensional region, volume is the numerical measure of a three-dimensional

solid. Most of us have computed volumes of solids by using basic geometric formulas. The volume of a rectangular solid,

for example, can be computed by multiplying length, width, and height: V = lwh. The formulas for the volume of a sphere

V = 4r3,3 a cone  V = 1r2 h,3 and a pyramid  V = 1 Ah3 have also been introduced. Although some of these

formulas were derived using geometry alone, all these formulas can be obtained by using integration.

We can also calculate the volume of a cylinder. Although most of us think of a cylinder as having a circular base, such as
a soup can or a metal rod, in mathematics the word cylinder has a more general meaning. To discuss cylinders in this more
general context, we first need to define some vocabulary.

We define the cross-section of a solid to be the intersection of a plane with the solid. A cylinder is defined as any solid
that can be generated by translating a plane region along a line perpendicular to the region, called the axis of the cylinder.
Thus, all cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder are identical. The solid shown in Figure 6.11 is an example
of a cylinder with a noncircular base. To calculate the volume of a cylinder, then, we simply multiply the area of the cross-

section by the height of the cylinder: V = A · h. In the case of a right circular cylinder (soup can), this becomes V = r2 h.

              Figure 6.11 Each cross-section of a particular cylinder is identical to the others.

If a solid does not have a constant cross-section (and it is not one of the other basic solids), we may not have a formula for
its volume. In this case, we can use a definite integral to calculate the volume of the solid. We do this by slicing the solid
into pieces, estimating the volume of each slice, and then adding those estimated volumes together. The slices should all be
parallel to one another, and when we put all the slices together, we should get the whole solid. Consider, for example, the
solid S shown in Figure 6.12, extending along the x-axis.

                                         Figure 6.12 A solid with a varying cross-section.

We want to divide S into slices perpendicular to the x-axis. As we see later in the chapter, there may be times when we
want to slice the solid in some other direction--say, with slices perpendicular to the y-axis. The decision of which way to
slice the solid is very important. If we make the wrong choice, the computations can get quite messy. Later in the chapter,
we examine some of these situations in detail and look at how to decide which way to slice the solid. For the purposes of
this section, however, we use slices perpendicular to the x-axis.

Because the cross-sectional area is not constant, we let A(x) represent the area of the cross-section at point x. Now let

P  =        x1 ...,            be a regular partition of           and for i = 1, 2,...n,  let Si represent the slice of S stretching from

                                         perpendicular to the x-axis.

Finally, for i = 1, 2,...n, let x*i be an arbitrary point in [xi - 1, xi]. Then the volume of slice Si can be estimated by

                     Adding these approximations together, we see the volume of the entire solid     S  can be approximated by

V S i    Ax*i  x.

                                                                        n
                                                                                   
                                                              V (S)

By now, we can recognize this as a Riemann sum, and our next step is to take the limit as n  . Then we have

                                                                     n                b

The technique we have just described is called the slicing method. To apply it, we use the following strategy.

  Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding Volumes by the Slicing Method
       1. Examine the solid and determine the shape of a cross-section of the solid. It is often helpful to draw a picture
            if one is not provided.
       2. Determine a formula for the area of the cross-section.
       3. Integrate the area formula over the appropriate interval to get the volume.

Recall that in this section, we assume the slices are perpendicular to the x-axis. Therefore, the area formula is in terms of
x and the limits of integration lie on the x-axis. However, the problem-solving strategy shown here is valid regardless of
how we choose to slice the solid.

   Example 6.6

     Deriving the Formula for the Volume of a Pyramid

     We know from geometry that the formula for the volume of a pyramid is V = 1 Ah. If the pyramid has a square
                                                                                                 3

     base, this becomes V = 1a2 h, where a denotes the length of one side of the base. We are going to use the
                                   3

      slicing method to derive this formula.

     Solution
      We want to apply the slicing method to a pyramid with a square base. To set up the integral, consider the pyramid
     shown in Figure 6.14, oriented along the x-axis.

     Figure 6.14 (a) A pyramid with a square base is oriented along the x-axis. (b) A two-dimensional view of the
     pyramid is seen from the side.

     We first want to determine the shape of a cross-section of the pyramid. We know the base is a square, so the
     cross-sections are squares as well (step 1). Now we want to determine a formula for the area of one of these cross-
     sectional squares. Looking at Figure 6.14(b), and using a proportion, since these are similar triangles, we have

     s  =  x  or  s                                                =              ax.h
     a     h

     Therefore, the area of one of the cross-sectional squares is

                                                 A(x) = s2 = ax2 step 2.

Then we find the volume of the pyramid by integrating from 0 to h (step 3):

Solids of Revolution

If a region in a plane is revolved around a line in that plane, the resulting solid is called a solid of revolution, as shown in
the following figure.
640  Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

                                    Figure 6.15 (a) This is the region that is revolved around the x-axis.
                                    (b) As the region begins to revolve around the axis, it sweeps out a
                                    solid of revolution. (c) This is the solid that results when the
                                    revolution is complete.

Solids of revolution are common in mechanical applications, such as machine parts produced by a lathe. We spend the rest
of this section looking at solids of this type. The next example uses the slicing method to calculate the volume of a solid of
revolution.

Example 6.7

  Using the Slicing Method to find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution

  Use the slicing method to find the volume of the solid of revolution bounded by the graphs of
   f (x) = x2 - 4x + 5, x = 1, and x = 4, and rotated about the x-axis.

  Solution
  Using the problem-solving strategy, we first sketch the graph of the quadratic function over the interval [1, 4] as
  shown in the following figure.

                                Figure 6.16 A region used to produce a solid of revolution.
Next, revolve the region around the x-axis, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 6.17 Two views, (a) and (b), of the solid of revolution produced by revolving the region
in Figure 6.16 about the x-axis.
642                                                              Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

     Since the solid was formed by revolving the region around the x-axis, the cross-sections are circles (step 1).
     The area of the cross-section, then, is the area of a circle, and the radius of the circle is given by f (x). Use the
     formula for the area of the circle:

                                                                2  2  2 2

                                        A(x) = r =  f (x) = x - 4x + 5 (step 2).

     The volume, then, is (step 3)

                             V      b
     The volume is 78/5.
                                =  A(x)dx

                                    a

                                =  4 x2 - 4x + 52dx =  4x4 - 8x3 + 26x2 - 40x + 25dx

     6.7 Use the method of slicing to find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving the region
     between the graph of the function f (x) = 1/x and the x-axis over the interval [1, 2] around the x-axis. See

     the following figure.

The Disk Method

When we use the slicing method with solids of revolution, it is often called the disk method because, for solids of
revolution, the slices used to over approximate the volume of the solid are disks. To see this, consider the solid of revolution
generated by revolving the region between the graph of the function f (x) = (x - 1)2 + 1 and the x-axis over the interval
[-1, 3] around the x-axis. The graph of the function and a representative disk are shown in Figure 6.18(a) and (b). The
region of revolution and the resulting solid are shown in Figure 6.18(c) and (d).

     revolving the rectangle about the x-axis. (c) The region under the curve is revolved about the x-axis, resulting in
      (d) the solid of revolution.

We already used the formal Riemann sum development of the volume formula when we developed the slicing method. We
know that

                                                                                       b

                                                             V= a
The only difference with the disk method is that we know the formula for the cross-sectional area ahead of time; it is the
area of a circle. This gives the following rule.

6.8 Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating the region
between the graph of f (x) = 4 - x and the x-axis over the interval [0, 4] around the x-axis.

So far, our examples have all concerned regions revolved around the x-axis, but we can generate a solid of revolution by
revolving a plane region around any horizontal or vertical line. In the next example, we look at a solid of revolution that has
been generated by revolving a region around the y-axis. The mechanics of the disk method are nearly the same as when

the x-axis is the axis of revolution, but we express the function in terms of y and we integrate with respect to y as well.

This is summarized in the following rule.

Rule: The Disk Method for Solids of Revolution around the y-axis

Let g(y) be continuous and nonnegative. Define Q as the region bounded on the right by the graph of g(y), on the
left by the y-axis, below by the line y = c, and above by the line y = d. Then, the volume of the solid of revolution
formed by revolving Q around the y-axis is given by

                                                  d                   2            (6.4)

The next example shows how this rule works in practice.

     Using the Disk Method to Find the Volume of a Solid of Revolution 2

Let R be the region bounded by the graph of g(y) = 4 - y and the y-axis over the y-axis interval [0, 4].
Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating R around the y-axis.

Solution
Figure 6.20 shows the function and a representative disk that can be used to estimate the volume. Notice that
since we are revolving the function around the y-axis, the disks are horizontal, rather than vertical.

     The volume is 8 units3.

        6.9 Use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution generated by rotating the region
        between the graph of g(y) = y and the y-axis over the interval [1, 4] around the y-axis.

The Washer Method

Some solids of revolution have cavities in the middle; they are not solid all the way to the axis of revolution. Sometimes,
this is just a result of the way the region of revolution is shaped with respect to the axis of revolution. In other cases, cavities
arise when the region of revolution is defined as the region between the graphs of two functions. A third way this can happen
is when an axis of revolution other than the x-axis or y-axis is selected.
When the solid of revolution has a cavity in the middle, the slices used to approximate the volume are not disks, but washers
(disks with holes in the center). For example, consider the region bounded above by the graph of the function f (x) = x
and below by the graph of the function g(x) = 1 over the interval [1, 4]. When this region is revolved around the x-axis,
the result is a solid with a cavity in the middle, and the slices are washers. The graph of the function and a representative
washer are shown in Figure 6.22(a) and (b). The region of revolution and the resulting solid are shown in Figure 6.22(c)
and (d).

  Using the Washer Method

  Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded above by the graph of f (x) = x
  and below by the graph of g(x) = 1/x over the interval [1, 4] around the x-axis.

  Solution
  The graphs of the functions and the solid of revolution are shown in the following figure.

As with the disk method, we can also apply the washer method to solids of revolution that result from revolving a region
around the y-axis. In this case, the following rule applies.

Rule: The Washer Method for Solids of Revolution around the y-axis

Suppose  u(y)  and  v(y)  are continuous, nonnegative functions such that  v(y)  u(y)        for  y             Let  Q  denote

                                                                                                       c,  d.

the region bounded on the right by the graph of u(y), on the left by the graph of v(y), below by the line y = c,

and above by the line y = d. Then, the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving Q around the y-axis

is given by

                                    d  2  2

                          V =  u(y) - v(y) dy.

Rather than looking at an example of the washer method with the y-axis as the axis of revolution, we now consider an
example in which the axis of revolution is a line other than one of the two coordinate axes. The same general method
applies, but you may have to visualize just how to describe the cross-sectional area of the volume.

   Example 6.11

     The Washer Method with a Different Axis of Revolution

     Find the volume of a solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded above by f (x) = 4 - x and
     below by the x-axis over the interval [0, 4] around the line y = -2.

     Solution
     The graph of the region and the solid of revolution are shown in the following figure.

                 Figure 6.24 (a) The region between the graph of the function f (x) = 4 - x and the x-axis
                 over the interval [0, 4]. (b) Revolving the region about the line y = -2 generates a solid of
                   revolution with a cylindrical hole through its middle.
      We can't apply the volume formula to this problem directly because the axis of revolution is not one of the

coordinate axes. However, we still know that the area of the cross-section is the area of the outer circle less the
area of the inner circle. Looking at the graph of the function, we see the radius of the outer circle is given by
 f (x) + 2, which simplifies to

                                                          f (x) + 2 = (4 - x) + 2 = 6 - x.

The radius of the inner circle is g(x) = 2. Therefore, we have

shells, we integrate along the coordinate axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution. The ability to choose which variable
of integration we want to use can be a significant advantage with more complicated functions. Also, the specific geometry
of the solid sometimes makes the method of using cylindrical shells more appealing than using the washer method. In the
last part of this section, we review all the methods for finding volume that we have studied and lay out some guidelines to
help you determine which method to use in a given situation.

The Method of Cylindrical Shells

Again, we are working with a solid of revolution. As before, we define a region R, bounded above by the graph of a
function y = f (x), below by the x-axis, and on the left and right by the lines x = a and x = b, respectively, as shown
in Figure 6.25(a). We then revolve this region around the y-axis, as shown in Figure 6.25(b). Note that this is different
from what we have done before. Previously, regions defined in terms of functions of x were revolved around the x-axis
or a line parallel to it.

     Figure 6.25 (a) A region bounded by the graph of a function of x. (b) The solid of revolution formed when the
     region is revolved around the y-axis.

As we have done many times before, partition the interval  a, b                     using a regular partition,  P = {x0, x1 ,..., xn}  and,

for i = 1, 2,..., n, choose a point x*i  [xi - 1, xi]. Then, construct a rectangle over the interval [xi - 1, xi] of height

 f (x*i ) and width x. A representative rectangle is shown in Figure 6.26(a). When that rectangle is revolved around the
y-axis, instead of a disk or a washer, we get a cylindrical shell, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 6.26 (a) A representative rectangle. (b) When this rectangle is revolved around the y-axis, the result is a cylindrical
shell. (c) When we put all the shells together, we get an approximation of the original solid.

To calculate the volume of this shell, consider Figure 6.27.

                                         Figure 6.27 Calculating the volume of the shell.

The shell is a cylinder, so its volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the height of the cylinder. The cross-sections
are annuli (ring-shaped regions--essentially, circles with a hole in the center), with outer radius xi and inner radius xi - 1.

Thus, the cross-sectional area is          x  2  -    x  2   1.  The height of the cylinder is     f (x*i ).   Then the volume of the shell is
                                              i          i-

                                                 V shell     =   f (x*i  )(  x  2  -    x  2   1)
                                                                                i          i-

                                                                            2 2 

                                                             =  f (x*i )xi - xi - 1

                                                             =  f (x*i )(xi + xi - 1)(xi - xi - 1)

                                                             = 2 f (x*i )    xi + xi - 1       (xi - xi - 1).
                                                                                      2

Note that xi - xi - 1 = x, so we have
658                                                                                                                        Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

                                                                        xi + xi - 1
                                                  Vshell = 2 f (x*i ) 2 x.

Furthermore, xi + x2 i - 1 is both the midpoint of the interval [xi - 1, xi] and the average radius of the shell, and we can
approximate this by x*i . We then have

                                                       Vshell  2 f (x*i )x*i x.

Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell and then opening it up to form a flat plate
(Figure 6.28).

Figure 6.28 (a) Make a vertical cut in a representative shell. (b) Open the shell up to form a flat plate.

In reality, the outer radius of the shell is greater than the inner radius, and hence the back edge of the plate would be slightly
longer than the front edge of the plate. However, we can approximate the flattened shell by a flat plate of height f (x*i ),
width 2x*i , and thickness x (Figure 6.28). The volume of the shell, then, is approximately the volume of the flat
plate. Multiplying the height, width, and depth of the plate, we get

                                          V shell     f (x*i  )2x*i                       

                                                                                          x,

which is the same formula we had before.

To calculate the volume of the entire solid, we then add the volumes of all the shells and obtain

                                                   n
                                                                                                 
                                          V                                       f (x*i
                                                      2x*i                                )x.

                                               i=1

Here we have another Riemann sum, this time for the function 2x f (x). Taking the limit as n   gives us

                                          n                                                    b
                                                                                             
     V=  lim                                          f (x*i                              =          x  f  (  x      x  .
         n                                     2x*i           )x                               a
                                                                                                  2              )d

                                          i=1

This leads to the following rule for the method of cylindrical shells.

As with the disk method and the washer method, we can use the method of cylindrical shells with solids of revolution,

For the next example, we look at a solid of revolution for which the graph of a function is revolved around a line other than
one of the two coordinate axes. To set this up, we need to revisit the development of the method of cylindrical shells. Recall
that we found the volume of one of the shells to be given by

                            V shell  =    f (x*i  )(  x  2    -                   x  2       1)
                                                         i                           i-

                                                    2 2 

                                     =  f (x*i )xi - xi - 1

                                     =  f (x*i )(xi + xi - 1)(xi - xi - 1)

                                     = 2 f (x*i )     xi + xi - 1                               (xi - xi - 1).
                                                                                  2

This was based on a shell with an outer radius of xi and an inner radius of xi - 1. If, however, we rotate the region around
a line other than the y-axis, we have a different outer and inner radius. Suppose, for example, that we rotate the region

around the line x = -k, where k is some positive constant. Then, the outer radius of the shell is xi + k and the inner
radius of the shell is xi - 1 + k. Substituting these terms into the expression for volume, we see that when a plane region is
rotated around the line x = -k, the volume of a shell is given by

                                        xi + k + xi - 1 + k
                                                                                                

                            = 2 f (x*i )                                                                        
                   V shell                                                                          xi + k - xi - 1 + k

                            = 2 f (x*i )          2            + kx.

As before, we notice that xi + x2 i - 1 is the midpoint of the interval [xi - 1, xi] and can be approximated by x*i . Then,
the approximate volume of the shell is

                                                              +                   k    f  (  x  *i  )x.
                                                                                     
                                     Vshell  2x*i

The remainder of the development proceeds as before, and we see that

                                               b

                                          2(x + k) f (x)dx.

                                     V= a

We could also rotate the region around other horizontal or vertical lines, such as a vertical line in the right half plane. In

each case, the volume formula must be adjusted accordingly. Specifically, the x-term in the integral must be replaced with
an expression representing the radius of a shell. To see how this works, consider the following example.

     Example 6.15

     A Region of Revolution Revolved around a Line

     Define R as the region bounded above by the graph of f (x) = x and below by the x-axis over the interval
     [1, 2]. Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving R around the line x = -1.

     Solution
     First, graph the region R and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.

For our final example in this section, let's look at the volume of a solid of revolution for which the region of revolution is
bounded by the graphs of two functions.

     Solution
     First, graph the region R and the associated solid of revolution, as shown in the following figure.

     The solid of revolution generated by revolving R around the y-axis.

     Note that the axis of revolution is the y-axis, so the radius of a shell is given simply by x. We don't need to
     make any adjustments to the x-term of our integrand. The height of a shell, though, is given by f (x) - g(x), so
     in this case we need to adjust the f (x) term of the integrand. Then the volume of the solid is given by

Which Method Should We Use?

We have studied several methods for finding the volume of a solid of revolution, but how do we know which method to use?
It often comes down to a choice of which integral is easiest to evaluate. Figure 6.34 describes the different approaches
for solids of revolution around the x-axis. It's up to you to develop the analogous table for solids of revolution around the
y-axis.

Let's take a look at a couple of additional problems and decide on the best approach to take for solving them.

   Example 6.17

     Selecting the Best Method

      For each of the following problems, select the best method to find the volume of a solid of revolution generated
     by revolving the given region around the x-axis, and set up the integral to find the volume (do not evaluate the
      integral).

          a. The region bounded by the graphs of y = x, y = 2 - x, and the x-axis.
          b. The region bounded by the graphs of y = 4x - x2 and the x-axis.

     Solution
           a. First, sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown.

     Figure 6.35 (a) The region R bounded by two lines and the x-axis. (b) The solid of
     revolution generated by revolving R about the x-axis.

     Looking at the region, if we want to integrate with respect to x, we would have to break the integral
     into two pieces, because we have different functions bounding the region over [0, 1] and [1, 2]. In this
     case, using the disk method, we would have

           1       2                                                                2         x) 2d x.

     V=    0    x   d  x  +                                                         1  (2  -

     If we used the shell method instead, we would use functions of y to represent the curves, producing

                   1
     V =   0 2y2 - y - ydy                                                                    

                     1

              =   0 2y2 - 2ydy.

         Neither of these integrals is particularly onerous, but since the shell method requires only one integral,
         and the integrand requires less simplification, we should probably go with the shell method in this case.

     b. First, sketch the region and the solid of revolution as shown.

               revolution generated by revolving R about the x-axis.

      Looking at the region, it would be problematic to define a horizontal rectangle; the region is bounded on
      the left and right by the same function. Therefore, we can dismiss the method of shells. The solid has no
      cavity in the middle, so we can use the method of disks. Then

                                      Learning Objectives

         6.4.1 Determine the length of a curve, y = f (x), between two points.
         6.4.2 Determine the length of a curve, x = g(y), between two points.
         6.4.3 Find the surface area of a solid of revolution.

In this section, we use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve. We can think of arc length as the distance you
would travel if you were walking along the path of the curve. Many real-world applications involve arc length. If a rocket
is launched along a parabolic path, we might want to know how far the rocket travels. Or, if a curve on a map represents a
road, we might want to know how far we have to drive to reach our destination.

We begin by calculating the arc length of curves defined as functions of x, then we examine the same process for curves
defined as functions of y. (The process is identical, with the roles of x and y reversed.) The techniques we use to find arc

length can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution, and we close the section with an examination of
this concept.

Arc Length of the Curve y = f(x)

In previous applications of integration, we required the function f (x) to be integrable, or at most continuous. However,
for calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for f (x). Here, we require f (x) to be differentiable, and
furthermore we require its derivative, f (x), to be continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are
called smooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.)

Let  f (x)  be a smooth function defined over                   a, b.  We want to calculate the length of the curve from the point      f         

                                                                                                                                    a,     (a)

to the point      f (b).    We start by using line segments to approximate the length of the curve. For  i = 0,  1, 2,..., n,

              b,

let  P = {xi}  be a regular partition of                      a, b.  Then, for  i = 1, 2,..., n,  construct a line segment from the point

                            to the point        f  (  x       Although it might seem logical to use either horizontal or vertical line segments,

xi - 1,  f (xi - 1)                       x i,           i).

we want our line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible. Figure 6.37 depicts this construct for n = 5.

                                       Figure 6.37 We can approximate the length of a curve by
                                       adding line segments.

To help us find the length of each line segment, we look at the change in vertical distance as well as the change in horizontal
distance over each interval. Because we have used a regular partition, the change in horizontal distance over each interval is
given by x. The change in vertical distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use yi = f (xi) - f (xi - 1)
to represent the change in vertical distance over the interval [xi - 1, xi], as shown in Figure 6.38. Note that some (or all)
yi may be negative.

                               Figure 6.38 A representative line segment approximates the
                               curve over the interval [xi - 1, xi].

By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the line segment is                                           (x)  2  +         2     We can also write this as

                                                                                                                     y    i .

f (x*i  ) = yi/(x).            Then the length of the line segment is given by                     x      1  +    f  (x*i   2   Adding up the lengths of all

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

Theorem 6.4: Arc Length for y = f(x)

Let     f (x)  be a smooth function over the interval               a, b.      Then the arc length of the portion of the graph of                  f (x)  from

the point          f           to the point      f           is  given  by

               a,     (a)                    b,     (b)

                                                                               b             (x)2                                                         (6.7)
                                                                                        
                                                    Arc Length = a                1  +    f        dx.

Note that we are integrating an expression involving f (x), so we need to be sure f (x) is integrable. This is why we
require f (x) to be smooth. The following example shows how to apply the theorem.

   Example 6.18

Solution

We have f (x) = 3x1/2,                   so   f (x)2  =  9x.  Then, the arc length is

                                                      Arc Length         b        1  +     f  (x)2   dx

Substitute u = 1 + 9x. Then, du = 9 dx. When x = 0, then u = 1, and when x = 1,                                         then u = 10. Thus,

Although it is nice to have a formula for calculating arc length, this particular theorem can generate expressions that
are difficult to integrate. We study some techniques for integration in Introduction to Techniques of Integration
(http://cnx.org/content/m53654/latest/) . In some cases, we may have to use a computer or calculator to approximate
the value of the integral.

     Using a Computer or Calculator to Determine the Arc Length of a Function of x

Let f (x) = x2. Calculate the arc length of the graph of f (x) over the interval [1, 3].

Solution

We have  f (x) = 2x,  so                  f (x)2  =   4x 2.  Then the arc length is given by

                                                                 b             (x)2               3  1 + 4x2 dx.

Arc Length of the Curve x = g(y)

We have just seen how to approximate the length of a curve with line segments. If we want to find the arc length of the
graph of a function of y, we can repeat the same process, except we partition the y-axis instead of the x-axis. Figure
6.39 shows a representative line segment.

                             Figure 6.39 A representative line segment over the interval
                             [yi - 1, yi].

Then the length of the line segment is     2  2                which can also be written as                      2       If we now
                                                                                                 y           1 + xi/y .

follow the same development we did earlier, we get a formula for arc length of a function x = g(y).

Theorem 6.5: Arc Length for x = g(y)

Let  g(y)  be a smooth function over an interval       c, d.      Then, the arc length of the graph of         g(y)  from the point

     g(c)  to the point      g(d)    is given by

c,                       d,

                                                               d                         2                               (6.8)

                                          Arc Length = c          1  +            g(y)      dy.

     Example 6.20

       Calculating the Arc Length of a Function of y

     Let g(y) = 3y3. Calculate the arc length of the graph of g(y) over the interval [1, 2].

     Solution

     We have g(y) = 9y2,     so    g(y)2  =  81y4.  Then the arc length is

                                                    d                2                      2  1 + 81y4 dy.

                                   Arc Length = c 1
                                                       1  +  g(y)                 dy  =

     Using a computer to approximate the value of this integral, we obtain

                                                     2

Area of a Surface of Revolution

The concepts we used to find the arc length of a curve can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution.

Surface area is the total area of the outer layer of an object. For objects such as cubes or bricks, the surface area of the

object is the sum of the areas of all of its faces. For curved surfaces, the situation is a little more complex. Let f (x) be a

nonnegative smooth function over the interval                        We wish to find the surface area of the surface of revolution created

As we have done many times before, we are going to partition the interval                       a, b     and approximate the surface area by

calculating the surface area of simpler shapes. We start by using line segments to approximate the curve, as we did earlier

in this section. For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n,  let  P  =         {xi}     be a regular partition of           Then, for  i  =  1,  2,...,  n,  construct a

                                                                                                a,  b.

                     formed by revolving the line segments around the x-axis.

Notice that when each line segment is revolved around the axis, it produces a band. These bands are actually pieces of cones
676  Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

(think of an ice cream cone with the pointy end cut off). A piece of a cone like this is called a frustum of a cone.

To find the surface area of the band, we need to find the lateral surface area, S, of the frustum (the area of just the slanted
outside surface of the frustum, not including the areas of the top or bottom faces). Let r1 and r2 be the radii of the wide
end and the narrow end of the frustum, respectively, and let l be the slant height of the frustum as shown in the following
figure.

                                       Figure 6.42 A frustum of a cone can approximate a small part
                                       of surface area.
We know the lateral surface area of a cone is given by

                                                     Lateral Surface Area = rs,
where r is the radius of the base of the cone and s is the slant height (see the following figure).

                                       Figure 6.43 The lateral surface area of the cone is given by
                                    rs.
Since a frustum can be thought of as a piece of a cone, the lateral surface area of the frustum is given by the lateral surface
area of the whole cone less the lateral surface area of the smaller cone (the pointy tip) that was cut off (see the following
figure).

                                         of a cone.

The cross-sections of the small cone and the large cone are similar triangles, so we see that
                                                                r2 = s - l.
                                                                r1 s

Solving for s, we get

                                                              r2 = s - l

                                                              r2 s = r1 (s - l)

                                                              r2s = r1s - r1l
                                                              r1l = r1s - r2s

                                                              r1 l = (r1 - r2)s

                                                     r1 l
                                                   r1 - r2 = s.

Then the lateral surface area (SA) of the frustum is

                       S = (Lateral SA of large cone) - (Lateral SA of small cone)

                                         = r1 s - r2 (s - l)

                                         = r1 r1 - r2 - r2 r1 - r2 - l

                                             r12 l r1 r2 l
                                         = r1 - r2 - r1 - r2 + r2 l

                                         = r1 - r2 - r1 - r2 + r1 - r2

                                         = r1 - r2 - r1 - r2 + r1 - r2 - r1 - r2

                                            2 2    (r1 - r2)(r1 + r2)l    = (r1 + r2)l.

                                         r1 - r2l
                                         = r -r =             r -r

Let's now use this formula to calculate the surface area of each of the bands formed by revolving the line segments around
the x-axis. A representative band is shown in the following figure.
678                                                                                                                                         Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

                                                  surface area.

Note that the slant height of this frustum is just the length of the line segment used to generate it. So, applying the surface
area formula, we have

                                                              S = (r1 + r2)l

                                                                    =      f  (xi  -  1)  +                     2  2

                                                                                             f (xi)         x + yi

                                                                          yi2
                                                                    =  f (xi - 1) + f (xi)x 1 +   .

                                                                                                         x

Now, as we did in the development of the arc length formula, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to select x*i  [xi - 1, xi]

such that   f (x*i    )     =     y i/x.          This gives us

                                                              S  =      f  (xi  -  1)  +  f  (  x        x  1    +    f  (x*i     2
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                   i)                            ) .

Furthermore, since                f (x)    is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a point                               x*  *    [xi - 1,  x i]  such that

                                                                                                                                             i

f (xi*  *)  =  (1  /        f  (  x  i  -  1)  +              so we get

                      2)                          f (xi),

                                                                    S = 2 f (xi* * )x                 1  +    f  (x*i     2
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                         ) .

Then the approximate surface area of the whole surface of revolution is given by

                                                                                   n      2 f (xi* * )x                                 2
                                                                                                                            
                                                     Surface Area                                                   1    +    f  (x*i  ) .

                                                                                i=1

This almost looks like a Riemann sum, except we have functions evaluated at two different points, x*i                                                 and      x* *,  over

                                                                                                                                                                i

the interval [xi - 1, xi]. Although we do not examine the details here, it turns out that because f (x) is smooth, if we let
n  , the limit works the same as a Riemann sum even with the two different evaluation points. This makes sense

intuitively. Both x*i                   and    x* *  are in the interval        [xi - 1, xi],            so it makes sense that as n  ,              both x*i  and x * *

                                                i                                                                                                                       i

approach x. Those of you who are interested in the details should consult an advanced calculus text.

Taking the limit as n  , we get

                                                                 n  2 f (xi* * )x                                 2              b                 2
                                                                                                      
                      Surface Area =                 lim                                     1     +    f  (x*i  )       =          2 f (x) 1 +  f (x) dx.

                                                     n        i=1                                                                a

As with arc length, we can conduct a similar development for functions of y to get a formula for the surface area of surfaces
of revolution about the y-axis. These findings are summarized in the following theorem.

       Calculating the Surface Area of a Surface of Revolution 2

       Let f (x) = y = 3 3x. Consider the portion of the curve where 0  y  2. Find the surface area of the surface
       generated by revolving the graph of f (x) around the y-axis.

       Solution
       Notice that we are revolving the curve around the y-axis, and the interval is in terms of y, so we want to
       rewrite the function as a function of y. We get x = g(y) = (1/3)y3. The graph of g(y) and the surface of rotation
       are shown in the following figure.

In this section, we examine some physical applications of integration. Let's begin with a look at calculating mass from a
density function. We then turn our attention to work, and close the section with a study of hydrostatic force.

Mass and Density

We can use integration to develop a formula for calculating mass based on a density function. First we consider a thin rod
or wire. Orient the rod so it aligns with the x-axis, with the left end of the rod at x = a and the right end of the rod at
x = b (Figure 6.48). Note that although we depict the rod with some thickness in the figures, for mathematical purposes
we assume the rod is thin enough to be treated as a one-dimensional object.

                                         Figure 6.48 We can calculate the mass of a thin rod oriented
                                         along the x-axis by integrating its density function.

If the rod has constant density , given in terms of mass per unit length, then the mass of the rod is just the product of the

density and the length of the rod: (b - a). If the density of the rod is not constant, however, the problem becomes a little

more challenging. When the density of the rod varies from point to point, we use a linear density function, (x), to denote

the density of the rod at any point, x. Let (x) be an integrable linear density function. Now, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n let

P  =  {xi}  be a regular partition of the interval           and for i = 1, 2,..., n choose an arbitrary point x*i   [xi - 1, xi].

                                                    a,  b,

Figure 6.49 shows a representative segment of the rod.

                                       Figure 6.49 A representative segment of the rod.

The mass mi of the segment of the rod from xi - 1 to xi is approximated by
                                                mi  (x*i )(xi - xi - 1) = (x*i )x.

Adding the masses of all the segments gives us an approximation for the mass of the entire rod:

                                                i=1     i=1

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n  , we get an expression for the exact mass of the rod:

                                                   n                                       b
                                     m = nlim  (x*i )x =  (x)dx.
                                                i=1                                        a

We state this result in the following theorem.

Theorem 6.7: Mass-Density Formula of a One-Dimensional Object

Given a thin rod oriented along the  x-axis     over the interval                          let (x) denote a linear density function giving

                                                                                  a,  b,

the density of the rod at a point x in the interval. Then the mass of the rod is given by

                                                           b                                                  (6.10)

                                                     (x)dx.

                                                m= a

We apply this theorem in the next example.

   Example 6.23

     Calculating Mass from Linear Density

     Consider a thin rod oriented on the x-axis over the interval [/2, ]. If the density of the rod is given by
     (x) = sin x, what is the mass of the rod?

     Solution
     Applying Equation 6.10 directly, we have

                                     b                
                                      (x)dx =                                                    x|
     m = a /2                                           sin        x              dx  =    -cos        =  1.
                                                                                                   /2

        6.23 Consider a thin rod oriented on the x-axis over the interval [1, 3]. If the density of the rod is given by
         (x) = 2x2 + 3, what is the mass of the rod?

We now extend this concept to find the mass of a two-dimensional disk of radius r. As with the rod we looked at in
the one-dimensional case, here we assume the disk is thin enough that, for mathematical purposes, we can treat it as a
two-dimensional object. We assume the density is given in terms of mass per unit area (called area density), and further
assume the density varies only along the disk's radius (called radial density). We orient the disk in the xy-plane, with
the center at the origin. Then, the density of the disk can be treated as a function of x, denoted (x). We assume
(x) is integrable. Because density is a function of x, we partition the interval from [0, r] along the x-axis. For
i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of the interval [0, r], and for i = 1, 2,..., n, choose an arbitrary
point x*i  [xi - 1, xi]. Now, use the partition to break up the disk into thin (two-dimensional) washers. A disk and a
representative washer are depicted in the following figure.

Figure 6.50 (a) A thin disk in the xy-plane. (b) A representative washer.

We now approximate the density and area of the washer to calculate an approximate mass, mi. Note that the area of the
washer is given by

                                                    Ai = (xi)2 - (xi - 1)2

                                                                             2 2 

                                                         = xi - xi - 1
                                                         = (xi + xi - 1)(xi - xi - 1)
                                                         = (xi + xi - 1)x.

You may recall that we had an expression similar to this when we were computing volumes by shells. As we did there, we
use x*i  (xi + xi - 1)/2 to approximate the average radius of the washer. We obtain

                                                  Ai = (xi + xi - 1)x  2x*i x.
Using (x*i ) to approximate the density of the washer, we approximate the mass of the washer by

                                            mi  2x*i (x*i )x.

Adding up the masses of the washers, we see the mass m of the entire disk is approximated by

                                         n             n
                                         m =  mi   2x*i (x*i )x.
                                         i=1           i=1

We again recognize this as a Riemann sum, and take the limit as n  . This gives us

                                         n                     r
                                         m = nlim  2x*i (x*i )x =  2x(x)dx.
                                         i=1                   0

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

Work Done by a Force

We now consider work. In physics, work is related to force, which is often intuitively defined as a push or pull on an object.
When a force moves an object, we say the force does work on the object. In other words, work can be thought of as the
amount of energy it takes to move an object. According to physics, when we have a constant force, work can be expressed
as the product of force and distance.

In the English system, the unit of force is the pound and the unit of distance is the foot, so work is given in foot-pounds. In

the metric system, kilograms and meters are used. One newton is the force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the
rate of 1 m/sec2. Thus, the most common unit of work is the newton-meter. This same unit is also called the joule. Both

are defined as kilograms times meters squared over seconds squared                      2 2
                                                                                  kg · m /s .

When we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant. The work done to
compress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the spring has already been compressed (or
stretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this section.

Suppose we have a variable force F(x) that moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point a to point

b.   To calculate the work done, we partition the interval                        and estimate the work done over each subinterval. So, for

                                                            a,  b

i = 0, 1, 2,..., n,  let  P  =  {xi}  be a regular partition of the interval                 and for i = 1, 2,..., n,  choose an arbitrary

                                                                                    a,  b,

point x*i  [xi - 1, xi]. To calculate the work done to move an object from point xi - 1 to point xi, we assume the

force is roughly constant over the interval, and use F(x*i ) to approximate the force. The work done over the interval
[xi - 1, xi], then, is given by

                                      Wi  F(x*i )(xi - xi - 1) = F(x*i )x.

Therefore, the work done over the interval           is approximately

                                            a,  b

                                                        n            n
                                            W =  Wi   F(x*i )x.
                                                     i=1        i=1

Taking the limit of this expression as n   gives us the exact value for work:

                                         W = nlim  F(x*i )x =  F(x)dx.
                                         i=1           a

Thus, we can define work as follows.

Definition

If a variable force F(x) moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point a to point b, then the work
done on the object is

                                                    b                   (6.12)

                                              F(x)dx.

                                         W= a

Note that if F is constant, the integral evaluates to F · (b - a) = F · d, which is the formula we stated at the beginning of

this section.

Now let's look at the specific example of the work done to compress or elongate a spring. Consider a block attached to a
horizontal spring. The block moves back and forth as the spring stretches and compresses. Although in the real world we
would have to account for the force of friction between the block and the surface on which it is resting, we ignore friction
here and assume the block is resting on a frictionless surface. When the spring is at its natural length (at rest), the system is
said to be at equilibrium. In this state, the spring is neither elongated nor compressed, and in this equilibrium position the
block does not move until some force is introduced. We orient the system such that x = 0 corresponds to the equilibrium
position (see the following figure).

                                       Figure 6.51 A block attached to a horizontal spring at
                                       equilibrium, compressed, and elongated.

According to Hooke's law, the force required to compress or stretch a spring from an equilibrium position is given by
F(x) = kx, for some constant k. The value of k depends on the physical characteristics of the spring. The constant k
is called the spring constant and is always positive. We can use this information to calculate the work done to compress or
elongate a spring, as shown in the following example.

   Example 6.25
690                                                                                       Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

     The Work Required to Stretch or Compress a Spring

     Suppose it takes a force of 10 N (in the negative direction) to compress a spring 0.2 m from the equilibrium
     position. How much work is done to stretch the spring 0.5 m from the equilibrium position?

     Solution
     First find the spring constant, k. When x = -0.2, we know F(x) = -10, so

                                                           F(x) = kx
                                                           -10 = k(-0.2)

                                                               k = 50

     and F(x) = 50x. Then, to calculate work, we integrate the force function, obtaining

     a| W =  F(x)dx = b  50x dx = 25x 0.5 2 00.5 = 6.25.0

     The work done to stretch the spring is 6.25 J.

        6.25 Suppose it takes a force of 8 lb to stretch a spring 6 in. from the equilibrium position. How much work
        is done to stretch the spring 1 ft from the equilibrium position?

Work Done in Pumping

Consider the work done to pump water (or some other liquid) out of a tank. Pumping problems are a little more complicated
than spring problems because many of the calculations depend on the shape and size of the tank. In addition, instead of
being concerned about the work done to move a single mass, we are looking at the work done to move a volume of water,
and it takes more work to move the water from the bottom of the tank than it does to move the water from the top of the
tank.

We examine the process in the context of a cylindrical tank, then look at a couple of examples using tanks of different
shapes. Assume a cylindrical tank of radius 4 m and height 10 m is filled to a depth of 8 m. How much work does it take
to pump all the water over the top edge of the tank?

The first thing we need to do is define a frame of reference. We let x represent the vertical distance below the top of the
tank. That is, we orient the x-axis vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank and the downward direction being positive
(see the following figure).

                                       Figure 6.52 How much work is needed to empty a tank
                                       partially filled with water?

Using this coordinate system, the water extends from x = 2 to x = 10. Therefore, we partition the interval [2, 10] and
look at the work required to lift each individual "layer" of water. So, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular
partition of the interval [2, 10], and for i = 1, 2,..., n, choose an arbitrary point x*i  [xi - 1, xi]. Figure 6.53
shows a representative layer.

                                       Figure 6.53 A representative layer of water.

In pumping problems, the force required to lift the water to the top of the tank is the force required to overcome gravity, so
it is equal to the weight of the water. Given that the weight-density of water is 9800 N/m3, or 62.4 lb/ft3, calculating the
volume of each layer gives us the weight. In this case, we have

                                                        V = (4)2 x = 16x.
Then, the force needed to lift each layer is

                                                  F = 9800 · 16x = 156,800x.
Note that this step becomes a little more difficult if we have a noncylindrical tank. We look at a noncylindrical tank in the
next example.
We also need to know the distance the water must be lifted. Based on our choice of coordinate systems, we can use x*i as
an approximation of the distance the layer must be lifted. Then the work to lift the ith layer of water Wi is approximately

                                                         Wi  156,800x*i x.
Adding the work for each layer, we see the approximate work to empty the tank is given by

The work required to empty the tank is approximately 23,650,000 J.

For pumping problems, the calculations vary depending on the shape of the tank or container. The following problem-
solving strategy lays out a step-by-step process for solving pumping problems.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving Pumping Problems

    1. Sketch a picture of the tank and select an appropriate frame of reference.
    2. Calculate the volume of a representative layer of water.
    3. Multiply the volume by the weight-density of water to get the force.
    4. Calculate the distance the layer of water must be lifted.
    5. Multiply the force and distance to get an estimate of the work needed to lift the layer of water.
    6. Sum the work required to lift all the layers. This expression is an estimate of the work required to pump out

         the desired amount of water, and it is in the form of a Riemann sum.
    7. Take the limit as n   and evaluate the resulting integral to get the exact work required to pump out the

         desired amount of water.

We now apply this problem-solving strategy in an example with a noncylindrical tank.

   Example 6.26

     A Pumping Problem with a Noncylindrical Tank

     Assume a tank in the shape of an inverted cone, with height 12 ft and base radius 4 ft. The tank is full to start
     with, and water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until the height of the water remaining in the tank is 4
      ft. How much work is required to pump out that amount of water?

     Solution
     The tank is depicted in Figure 6.54. As we did in the example with the cylindrical tank, we orient the x-axis
      vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank and the downward direction being positive (step 1).

                                Figure 6.54 A water tank in the shape of an inverted cone.
The tank starts out full and ends with 4 ft of water left, so, based on our chosen frame of reference, we need
to partition the interval [0, 8]. Then, for i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of the interval
[0, 8], and for i = 1, 2,..., n, choose an arbitrary point x*i  [xi - 1, xi]. We can approximate the volume
of a layer by using a disk, then use similar triangles to find the radius of the disk (see the following figure).

     From properties of similar triangles, we have

                                             ri         = 4 =1
                                         12 - x*i           12 3

                                                       3ri = 12 - x*i

                                                       ri = 12 - x* 3 i

                                                        = 4 - x*3i .

     Then the volume of the disk is

                                                 x*i 2
                                         Vi = 4 -  x (step 2).

                                                        3

     The weight-density of water is 62.4 lb/ft3, so the force needed to lift each layer is approximately

                                                     x*i 2
                                        Fi  62.44 -  x (step 3).

                                                             3

     Based on the diagram, the distance the water must be lifted is approximately x*i feet (step 4), so the approximate
     work needed to lift the layer is

                                                      x*i 2
                                     Wi  62.4x*i 4 -  x (step 5).

                                                               3

     Summing the work required to lift all the layers, we get an approximate value of the total work:

                                     n              n                              x*i 2
     W =  Wi   62.4x*i 4 -  x (step 6).
                                     i=1 i=1 3

     Taking the limit as n  , we obtain

                    n  x*i 2

     W = nlim  62.4x*i 4 - 3  x

     = 62.4 x16 - + dx = 62.4 16x - + dx
                                     0              39                            0       39

                                                      9 36

     It takes approximately 33,450 ft-lb of work to empty the tank to the desired level.

     6.26 A tank is in the shape of an inverted cone, with height 10 ft and base radius 6 ft. The tank is filled to a
     depth of 8 ft to start with, and water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until 3 ft of water remain in the
     tank. How much work is required to pump out that amount of water?

Hydrostatic Force and Pressure

In this last section, we look at the force and pressure exerted on an object submerged in a liquid. In the English system, force
is measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure is force per unit area, so in the English
system we have pounds per square foot (or, perhaps more commonly, pounds per square inch, denoted psi). In the metric
system we have newtons per square meter, also called pascals.

Let's begin with the simple case of a plate of area A submerged horizontally in water at a depth s (Figure 6.56). Then, the
force exerted on the plate is simply the weight of the water above it, which is given by F = As, where  is the weight
density of water (weight per unit volume). To find the hydrostatic pressure--that is, the pressure exerted by water on a
submerged object--we divide the force by the area. So the pressure is p = F/A = s.

                                         Figure 6.56 A plate submerged horizontally in water.

By Pascal's principle, the pressure at a given depth is the same in all directions, so it does not matter if the plate is submerged
horizontally or vertically. So, as long as we know the depth, we know the pressure. We can apply Pascal's principle to find
the force exerted on surfaces, such as dams, that are oriented vertically. We cannot apply the formula F = As directly,

because the depth varies from point to point on a vertically oriented surface. So, as we have done many times before, we
form a partition, a Riemann sum, and, ultimately, a definite integral to calculate the force.

Suppose a thin plate is submerged in water. We choose our frame of reference such that the x-axis is oriented vertically, with
the downward direction being positive, and point x = 0 corresponding to a logical reference point. Let s(x) denote the

depth at point x. Note we often let x = 0 correspond to the surface of the water. In this case, depth at any point is simply
given by s(x) = x. However, in some cases we may want to select a different reference point for x = 0, so we proceed

with the development in the more general case. Last, let w(x) denote the width of the plate at the point x.

Assume the top edge of the plate is at point x = a and the bottom edge of the plate is at point x = b. Then, for

i = 0, 1, 2,..., n,  let  P  =  {xi}     be a regular partition of the interval           and for i = 1, 2,..., n,  choose an arbitrary

                                                                                 a,  b,

point x*i  [xi - 1, xi]. The partition divides the plate into several thin, rectangular strips (see the following figure).
696                                                                                                       Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

     Figure 6.57 A thin plate submerged vertically in water.

Let's now estimate the force on a representative strip. If the strip is thin enough, we can treat it as if it is at a constant depth,
s(x*i ). We then have

                 Fi  =  As  =                                                        )xs(x*i  ).

                               w(x*i

Adding the forces, we get an estimate for the force on the plate:

                     n         n
                                                                                        )xs(x*i
           F            Fi  =                                                                     ).
                                    w(x*i
                  i=1          i=1

This is a Riemann sum, so taking the limit gives us the exact force. We obtain

              n                                                                           b               (6.13)
           nlim             )xs(x*i
     F  =                                                                         )  =    a  w(x)s(x)dx.
                  w(x*i
           i=1

Evaluating this integral gives us the force on the plate. We summarize this in the following problem-solving strategy.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding Hydrostatic Force

    1. Sketch a picture and select an appropriate frame of reference. (Note that if we select a frame of reference other
         than the one used earlier, we may have to adjust Equation 6.13 accordingly.)

    2. Determine the depth and width functions, s(x) and w(x).

    3. Determine the weight-density of whatever liquid with which you are working. The weight-density of water is
         62.4 lb/ft3, or 9800 N/m3.

    4. Use the equation to calculate the total force.

Select a frame of reference with the x-axis oriented vertically and the downward direction being positive. Select
the top of the trough as the point corresponding to x = 0 (step 1). The depth function, then, is s(x) = x. Using
similar triangles, we see that w(x) = 8 - (8/3)x (step 2). Now, the weight density of water is 62.4 lb/ft3 (step

3), so applying Equation 6.13, we obtain

       Chapter Opener: Finding Hydrostatic Force

       We now return our attention to the Hoover Dam, mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. The actual dam is
       arched, rather than flat, but we are going to make some simplifying assumptions to help us with the calculations.
       Assume the face of the Hoover Dam is shaped like an isosceles trapezoid with lower base 750 ft, upper base
       1250 ft, and height 750 ft (see the following figure).

     When the reservoir is full, Lake Mead's maximum depth is about 530 ft, and the surface of the lake is about 10 ft
     below the top of the dam (see the following figure).

         a. Find the force on the face of the dam when the reservoir is full.
         b. The southwest United States has been experiencing a drought, and the surface of Lake Mead is about 125
              ft below where it would be if the reservoir were full. What is the force on the face of the dam under these
              circumstances?
     Solution
         a. We begin by establishing a frame of reference. As usual, we choose to orient the x-axis vertically, with
              the downward direction being positive. This time, however, we are going to let x = 0 represent the top
              of the dam, rather than the surface of the water. When the reservoir is full, the surface of the water is 10
              ft below the top of the dam, so s(x) = x - 10 (see the following figure).

                           Figure 6.60 We first choose a frame of reference.
To find the width function, we again turn to similar triangles as shown in the figure below.

                                         Figure 6.61 We use similar triangles to determine a function

                                         (b) highlighting the similar triangles.

From the figure, we see that             w(x) = 750 + 2r. Using properties of similar triangles, we get
r = 250 - (1/3)x. Thus,                     w(x) = 1250 - 2x (step 2).

6.6 | Moments and Centers of Mass

                                         Learning Objectives

6.6.1  Find the center of mass of objects distributed along a line.
6.6.2  Locate the center of mass of a thin plate.
6.6.3  Use symmetry to help locate the centroid of a thin plate.
6.6.4  Apply the theorem of Pappus for volume.

In this section, we consider centers of mass (also called centroids, under certain conditions) and moments. The basic idea
of the center of mass is the notion of a balancing point. Many of us have seen performers who spin plates on the ends of
sticks. The performers try to keep several of them spinning without allowing any of them to drop. If we look at a single plate
(without spinning it), there is a sweet spot on the plate where it balances perfectly on the stick. If we put the stick anywhere
other than that sweet spot, the plate does not balance and it falls to the ground. (That is why performers spin the plates; the
spin helps keep the plates from falling even if the stick is not exactly in the right place.) Mathematically, that sweet spot is
called the center of mass of the plate.

In this section, we first examine these concepts in a one-dimensional context, then expand our development to consider
centers of mass of two-dimensional regions and symmetry. Last, we use centroids to find the volume of certain solids by
applying the theorem of Pappus.

Center of Mass and Moments

Let's begin by looking at the center of mass in a one-dimensional context. Consider a long, thin wire or rod of negligible
mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure 6.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses m1 and m2 at
distances d1 and d2 from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.62(b).

                                       Figure 6.62 (a) A thin rod rests on a fulcrum. (b) Masses are
                                       placed on the rod.

The most common real-life example of a system like this is a playground seesaw, or teeter-totter, with children of different
weights sitting at different distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one child sits at each end, the heavier child sinks
down and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the seesaw balances.
Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if m1 d1 = m2 d2.

In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However,
we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system by
moving the fulcrum. Suppose we have two point masses, m1 and m2, located on a number line at points x1 and x2,
respectively (Figure 6.63). The center of mass, -x , is the point where the fulcrum should be placed to make the system
balance.
704                                                                                     Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

               Figure 6.63 The center of mass -x is the balance point of
               the system.

Thus, we have

               m1 |x1 - -x | = m2 |x2 - -x |
               -                                                                    -
               m1  x - x1 = m2 x2 - x                                             

               m1 -x - m1 x1 = m2 x2 - m2 -x
                 -x (m1 + m2) = m1 x1 + m2 x2

                                                  -         m1 x1 + m2 x2
                                                   x = m +m .
                                                                                    12

The expression in the numerator, m1 x1 + m2 x2, is called the first moment of the system with respect to the origin. If the
context is clear, we often drop the word first and just refer to this expression as the moment of the system. The expression
in the denominator, m1 + m2, is the total mass of the system. Thus, the center of mass of the system is the point at which
the total mass of the system could be concentrated without changing the moment.

This idea is not limited just to two point masses. In general, if n masses, m1, m2 ,..., mn, are placed on a number line at
points x1, x2 ,..., xn, respectively, then the center of mass of the system is given by

                                                            n

                                                       mixi

                                                  -x = i = 1 .

                                                        mi

                                                           i=1

Theorem 6.9: Center of Mass of Objects on a Line

Let m1, m2 ,..., mn be point masses placed on a number line at points x1, x2 ,..., xn, respectively, and let

          n

m =  mi denote the total mass of the system. Then, the moment of the system with respect to the origin is given

        i=1

by

                                                            n                           (6.14)

                                                  M =  mi xi

                                                         i=1

and the center of mass of the system is given by

                                                  -x = M .                              (6.15)
                                                        m

We apply this theorem in the following example.

   Example 6.29

     Finding the Center of Mass of Objects along a Line

      Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows:

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12
Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration                                                              705

              m1 = 30 kg, placed at x1 = -2 m          m2 = 5 kg, placed at x2 = 3 m
              m3 = 10 kg, placed at x3 = 6 m           m4 = 15 kg, placed at x4 = -3 m.

Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the system.

Solution
First, we need to calculate the moment of the system:

                                                     4

                                         M =  mixi

                                                  i=1

                                             = -60 + 15 + 60 - 45 = -30.

Now, to find the center of mass, we need the total mass of the system:

                                                    4

                                         m =  mi

                                                  i=1

                                             = 30 + 5 + 10 + 15 = 60 kg.

Then we have

                                         -x = M = -30 = - 1.
                                         m 60                   2

The center of mass is located 1/2 m to the left of the origin.

6.29 Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows:

              m1 = 12 kg, placed at x1 = -4 m                   m2 = 12 kg, placed at x2 = 4 m
              m3 = 30 kg, placed at x3 = 2 m                    m4 = 6 kg, placed at x4 = -6 m.

Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the system.

We can generalize this concept to find the center of mass of a system of point masses in a plane. Let m1 be a point
mass located at point (x1, y1) in the plane. Then the moment Mx of the mass with respect to the x-axis is given by
Mx = m1 y1. Similarly, the moment My with respect to the y-axis is given by My = m1 x1. Notice that the x-coordinate

of the point is used to calculate the moment with respect to the y-axis, and vice versa. The reason is that the x-coordinate
gives the distance from the point mass to the y-axis, and the y-coordinate gives the distance to the x-axis (see the following
figure).

                                   Figure 6.64 Point mass m1 is located at point (x1, y1) in
                                       the plane.

If we have several point masses in the xy-plane, we can use the moments with respect to the x- and y-axes to calculate the
706                                                                                       Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

x- and y-coordinates of the center of mass of the system.

Theorem 6.10: Center of Mass of Objects in a Plane

Let m1, m2 ,..., mn be point masses located in the xy-plane at points (x1, y1), (x2, y2),..., (xn, yn), respectively,

                     n

and let m =  mi denote the total mass of the system. Then the moments Mx and My of the system with respect

                  i=1

to the x- and y-axes, respectively, are given by

                   n                                                              n                              (6.16)
                   Mx =  mi yi and My =  mi xi.
                   i=1                                                            i=1

Also, the coordinates of the center of mass  -   -y    of  the  system            are
                                             x,      

                   - My                                         - Mx                                             (6.17)
                   x = m and y = m .

The next example demonstrates how to apply this theorem.

   Example 6.30

     Finding the Center of Mass of Objects in a Plane

     Suppose three point masses are placed in the xy-plane as follows (assume coordinates are given in meters):
                                                   m1 = 2 kg, placed at (-1, 3),

                                                   m3 = 4 kg, placed at (2, -2).

     Find the center of mass of the system.

     Solution
     First we calculate the total mass of the system:

                                                                      3

                                    m =  mi = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 kg.

                                                                    i=1

     Next we find the moments with respect to the x- and y-axes:

                                                                      3

                                   My =  mixi = -2 + 6 + 8 = 12,

                                                                    i=1
                                                                      3

                                   Mx =  miyi = 6 + 6 - 8 = 4.

                                                                    i=1

     Then we have

                   -x = My = 12 = 1 and -y = Mx = 4 = 1.
                                             m 12                                 m 12 3

     The center of mass of the system is (1, 1/3), in meters.

        6.30 Suppose three point masses are placed on a number line as follows (assume coordinates are given in
        meters):

                                                      m1 = 5 kg, placed at (-2, -3),

        Find the center of mass of the system.

Center of Mass of Thin Plates

So far we have looked at systems of point masses on a line and in a plane. Now, instead of having the mass of a system
concentrated at discrete points, we want to look at systems in which the mass of the system is distributed continuously
across a thin sheet of material. For our purposes, we assume the sheet is thin enough that it can be treated as if it is two-
dimensional. Such a sheet is called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this
section, we also assume the density of the lamina is constant.

Laminas are often represented by a two-dimensional region in a plane. The geometric center of such a region is called its
centroid. Since we have assumed the density of the lamina is constant, the center of mass of the lamina depends only on
the shape of the corresponding region in the plane; it does not depend on the density. In this case, the center of mass of the
lamina corresponds to the centroid of the delineated region in the plane. As with systems of point masses, we need to find
the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes.

We first consider a lamina in the shape of a rectangle. Recall that the center of mass of a lamina is the point where the lamina
balances. For a rectangle, that point is both the horizontal and vertical center of the rectangle. Based on this understanding,
it is clear that the center of mass of a rectangular lamina is the point where the diagonals intersect, which is a result of the
symmetry principle, and it is stated here without proof.

  Theorem 6.11: The Symmetry Principle

   If a region R is symmetric about a line l, then the centroid of R lies on l.

Let's turn to more general laminas. Suppose we have a lamina bounded above by the graph of a continuous function f (x),
below by the x-axis, and on the left and right by the lines x = a and x = b, respectively, as shown in the following figure.

                                         Figure 6.65 A region in the plane representing a lamina.

As with systems of point masses, to find the center of mass of the lamina, we need to find the total mass of the lamina, as

well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes. As we have done many times before, we approximate

these quantities by partitioning the interval           and constructing rectangles.

                                               a,  b

For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n,  let  P = {xi}   be a regular partition of    a, b.   Recall that we can choose any point within the

interval [xi - 1, xi] as our x*i . In this case, we want x*i to be the x-coordinate of the centroid of our rectangles. Thus, for

i = 1, 2,..., n, we select x*i  [xi - 1, xi] such that x*i is the midpoint of the interval. That is, x*i = (xi - 1 + xi)/2.

Now, for i = 1, 2,..., n,  construct a rectangle of height              on  [xi - 1,  xi].  The center of mass of this rectangle is
                                                                    
                                                            f x*i
708                                                                                                    Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

       
x*i ,  f (x*i )/2, as shown in the following figure.

                            Figure 6.66 A representative rectangle of the lamina.

Next, we need to find the total mass of the rectangle. Let  represent the density of the lamina (note that  is a constant).
In this case,  is expressed in terms of mass per unit area. Thus, to find the total mass of the rectangle, we multiply the area
of the rectangle by . Then, the mass of the rectangle is given by  f (x*i )x.

To get the approximate mass of the lamina, we add the masses of all the rectangles to get

                                       n

                              m    f (x*i )x.

                                     i=1

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n   gives the exact mass of the lamina:

                                 n                                                b
                              m = nlim   f (x*i )x =  f (x)dx.
                              i=1                                                 a

Next, we calculate the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis. Returning to the representative rectangle, recall its

                            
center of mass is x*i ,  f (x*i )/2. Recall also that treating the rectangle as if it is a point mass located at the center of

mass does not change the moment. Thus, the moment of the rectangle with respect to the x-axis is given by the mass of

the rectangle,  f (x*i )x,  multiplied by the distance from the center of mass to the x-axis:                         Therefore, the

                                                                                                        f (x*i  )/2.

moment with respect to the x-axis of the rectangle is            2                Adding the moments of the rectangles and taking

                                                        f (x*i  ) /2x.

the limit of the resulting Riemann sum, we see that the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis is

                              n                         f (x*i )2                       b f (x)2
                              Mx = lim                                            x = 
                              n  i = 1 2                                                a2        dx.

We derive the moment with respect to the y-axis similarly, noting that the distance from the center of mass of the rectangle
to the y-axis is x*i . Then the moment of the lamina with respect to the y-axis is given by

                              n                                                          b
                              My = nlim  x*i f (x*i )x =  x f (x)dx.
                              i=1                                                       a

We find the coordinates of the center of mass by dividing the moments by the total mass to give
 -x = My/m and -y = Mx/m. If we look closely at the expressions for Mx, My, and m, we notice that the constant 

cancels out when -x and -y are calculated.

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

and right by the lines x = a and x = b, respectively. Let  denote the density of the associated lamina. Then we
can make the following statements:

i. The mass of the lamina is

                                                                                b             (6.18)

                                         Mx = a 2 dx and My =  b f (x)2 a x f (x)dx. b        (6.19)

                                             x = m and y = m .

In the next example, we use this theorem to find the center of mass of a lamina.

   Example 6.31

     Finding the Center of Mass of a Lamina

     Let R be the region bounded above by the graph of the function f (x) = x and below by the x-axis over the
     interval [0, 4]. Find the centroid of the region.

     Solution
      The region is depicted in the following figure.

                                         Figure 6.67 Finding the center of mass of a lamina.

Since we are only asked for the centroid of the region, rather than the mass or moments of the associated
lamina, we know the density constant  cancels out of the calculations eventually. Therefore, for the sake of

convenience, let's assume  = 1.

First, we need to calculate the total mass:

                                                 b       4

     Thus, we have

We can adapt this approach to find centroids of more complex regions as well. Suppose our region is bounded above by the
graph of a continuous function f (x), as before, but now, instead of having the lower bound for the region be the x-axis,
suppose the region is bounded below by the graph of a second continuous function, g(x), as shown in the following figure.

Theorem 6.13: Center of Mass of a Lamina Bounded by Two Functions

Let R denote a region bounded above by the graph of a continuous function f (x), below by the graph of the
continuous function g(x), and on the left and right by the lines x = a and x = b, respectively. Let  denote the
density of the associated lamina. Then we can make the following statements:

         i. The mass of the lamina is

                                                                   b             g(x)d                                   (6.21)

         ii. The moments Mx and My of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes, respectively, are

     Solution
      The region is depicted in the following figure.

The graphs of the functions intersect at (-2, -3) and (1, 0), so we integrate from -2 to 1. Once again, for the
sake of convenience, assume  = 1.

First, we need to calculate the total mass:

The centroid of the region is -(1/2), -(3/5).

        6.32 Let R be the region bounded above by the graph of the function f (x) = 6 - x2 and below by the graph
        of the function g(x) = 3 - 2x. Find the centroid of the region.

The Symmetry Principle

We stated the symmetry principle earlier, when we were looking at the centroid of a rectangle. The symmetry principle can
be a great help when finding centroids of regions that are symmetric. Consider the following example.

   Example 6.33

     Finding the Centroid of a Symmetric Region

     Let R be the region bounded above by the graph of the function f (x) = 4 - x2 and below by the x-axis. Find the
      centroid of the region.

     Solution
      The region is depicted in the following figure.

                                Figure 6.71 We can use the symmetry principle to help find
                                the centroid of a symmetric region.

The region is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the centroid is zero. We need
only calculate -y . Once again, for the sake of convenience, assume  = 1.
First, we calculate the total mass:

     Next, we calculate the moments. We only need Mx :

                   Mx = a 2 dx b f (x)2

                   = 1 2 4 - x22 dx = 1 2 16 - 8x2 + x4dx

     Then we have

The Grand Canyon Skywalk

The Grand Canyon Skywalk opened to the public on March 28, 2007. This engineering marvel is a horseshoe-shaped
observation platform suspended 4000 ft above the Colorado River on the West Rim of the Grand Canyon. Its crystal-
clear glass floor allows stunning views of the canyon below (see the following figure).

  Figure 6.72 The Grand Canyon Skywalk offers magnificent views of the canyon. (credit: 10da_ralta, Wikimedia
  Commons)

The Skywalk is a cantilever design, meaning that the observation platform extends over the rim of the canyon, with no
visible means of support below it. Despite the lack of visible support posts or struts, cantilever structures are engineered
to be very stable and the Skywalk is no exception. The observation platform is attached firmly to support posts that
extend 46 ft down into bedrock. The structure was built to withstand 100-mph winds and an 8.0-magnitude earthquake
within 50 mi, and is capable of supporting more than 70,000,000 lb.

One factor affecting the stability of the Skywalk is the center of gravity of the structure. We are going to calculate
the center of gravity of the Skywalk, and examine how the center of gravity changes when tourists walk out onto the
observation platform.

The observation platform is U-shaped. The legs of the U are 10 ft wide and begin on land, under the visitors' center,
48 ft from the edge of the canyon. The platform extends 70 ft over the edge of the canyon.

To calculate the center of mass of the structure, we treat it as a lamina and use a two-dimensional region in the xy-plane
to represent the platform. We begin by dividing the region into three subregions so we can consider each subregion
716  Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

separately. The first region, denoted R1, consists of the curved part of the U. We model R1 as a semicircular annulus,
with inner radius 25 ft and outer radius 35 ft, centered at the origin (see the following figure).

                   Figure 6.73 We model the Skywalk with three sub-regions.

  The legs of the platform, extending 35 ft between R1 and the canyon wall, comprise the second sub-region, R2. Last,
  the ends of the legs, which extend 48 ft under the visitor center, comprise the third sub-region, R3. Assume the density
   of the lamina is constant and assume the total weight of the platform is 1,200,000 lb (not including the weight of the
  visitor center; we will consider that later). Use g = 32 ft/sec2.

       1. Compute the area of each of the three sub-regions. Note that the areas of regions R2 and R3 should include
            the areas of the legs only, not the open space between them. Round answers to the nearest square foot.

       2. Determine the mass associated with each of the three sub-regions.
       3. Calculate the center of mass of each of the three sub-regions.
       4. Now, treat each of the three sub-regions as a point mass located at the center of mass of the corresponding

            sub-region. Using this representation, calculate the center of mass of the entire platform.
       5. Assume the visitor center weighs 2,200,000 lb, with a center of mass corresponding to the center of mass of

            R3. Treating the visitor center as a point mass, recalculate the center of mass of the system. How does the
            center of mass change?
       6. Although the Skywalk was built to limit the number of people on the observation platform to 120, the platform
            is capable of supporting up to 800 people weighing 200 lb each. If all 800 people were allowed on the platform,
            and all of them went to the farthest end of the platform, how would the center of gravity of the system be
            affected? (Include the visitor center in the calculations and represent the people by a point mass located at the
            farthest edge of the platform, 70 ft from the canyon wall.)

Theorem of Pappus

This section ends with a discussion of the theorem of Pappus for volume, which allows us to find the volume of particular

kinds of solids by using the centroid. (There is also a theorem of Pappus for surface area, but it is much less useful than the
theorem for volume.)

  Theorem 6.14: Theorem of Pappus for Volume
   Let R be a region in the plane and let l be a line in the plane that does not intersect R. Then the volume of the solid of
   revolution formed by revolving R around l is equal to the area of R multiplied by the distance d traveled by the centroid
   of R.

Proof

We can prove the case when the region is bounded above by the graph of a function f (x) and below by the graph of a

function  g(x)      over an interval              and for which the axis of revolution is the y-axis. In this case, the area of the region is

       b               g(x)d      Since the axis of rotation is the y-axis, the distance traveled by the centroid of the region depends
          
A= a        f  (x)  -         x.

only on the x-coordinate of the centroid, -x , which is

                                                                    - My
                                                                    x = m,

where

                                                    b           g(x)dx                          b                  g(x)d

Then,

                                                                        b                     g(x)d

                                                                           b               g(x)d
                                                                              
                                                                    a           f  (x)  -          x

and thus

                                                                           b                  g(x)d

                                                        d · A = 2 a           x    f  (x)  -          x.

However, using the method of cylindrical shells, we have

                                                                        b                  g(x)d

                                                             V = 2 a       x    f  (x)  -          x.

So,

                                                                    V =d·A

and the proof is complete.

               circular region R in the plane; (b) the torus generated by revolving R about the y-axis.

The region R is a circle of radius 2, so the area of R is A = 4 units2. By the symmetry principle, the centroid of
R is the center of the circle. The centroid travels around the y-axis in a circular path of radius 4, so the centroid
travels d = 8 units. Then, the volume of the torus is A · d = 32 2 units3.

6.7 | Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms

                             Learning Objectives

6.7.1 Write the definition of the natural logarithm as an integral.
6.7.2 Recognize the derivative of the natural logarithm.
6.7.3 Integrate functions involving the natural logarithmic function.
6.7.4 Define the number e through an integral.
6.7.5 Recognize the derivative and integral of the exponential function.
6.7.6 Prove properties of logarithms and exponential functions using integrals.
6.7.7 Express general logarithmic and exponential functions in terms of natural logarithms and
exponentials.

We already examined exponential functions and logarithms in earlier chapters. However, we glossed over some key details
in the previous discussions. For example, we did not study how to treat exponential functions with exponents that are
irrational. The definition of the number e is another area where the previous development was somewhat incomplete. We
now have the tools to deal with these concepts in a more mathematically rigorous way, and we do so in this section.

For purposes of this section, assume we have not yet defined the natural logarithm, the number e, or any of the integration
and differentiation formulas associated with these functions. By the end of the section, we will have studied these concepts
in a mathematically rigorous way (and we will see they are consistent with the concepts we learned earlier).

We begin the section by defining the natural logarithm in terms of an integral. This definition forms the foundation for
the section. From this definition, we derive differentiation formulas, define the number e, and expand these concepts to
logarithms and exponential functions of any base.

The Natural Logarithm as an Integral

Recall the power rule for integrals:

                                          xn dx = xn + 1 + C, n  -1.

                                                      n+1

Clearly, this does not work when n = -1, as it would force us to divide by zero. So, what do we do with  1xdx ? Recall

from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that   x  1dt  is an antiderivative of             Therefore, we can make the following
                                                   t
                                                1                                     1/x.

For x > 0, define the natural logarithm function by

                                                                                   x

                                              1dt.

                                                                    t
                                                       ln x =

                                                                                  1

For x > 1,   this is just the area under the curve y = 1/t from 1 to x. For x < 1,          we have   x  1dt     -  1  1dt,  so in
                                                                                                         t             t
                                                                                                      1       =     x

this case it is the negative of the area under the curve from x to 1 (see the following figure).
722                                                                                   Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

     Figure 6.75 (a) When x > 1, the natural logarithm is the area under the
     curve y = 1/t from 1 to x. (b) When x < 1, the natural logarithm is the
     negative of the area under the curve from x to 1.

Notice that ln 1 = 0. Furthermore, the function y = 1/t > 0 for x > 0. Therefore, by the properties of integrals, it is clear
that ln x is increasing for x > 0.

Properties of the Natural Logarithm

Because of the way we defined the natural logarithm, the following differentiation formula falls out immediately as a result
of to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Theorem 6.15: Derivative of the Natural Logarithm

For x > 0, the derivative of the natural logarithm is given by

     d   ln  x  =                                                                 1.

Theorem 6.16: Corollary to the Derivative of the Natural Logarithm
The function ln x is differentiable; therefore, it is continuous.

A graph of ln x is shown in Figure 6.76. Notice that it is continuous throughout its domain of (0, ).

          d   32
    b. lnx 

         dx

Note that if we use the absolute value function and create a new function ln |x|, we can extend the domain of the natural
logarithm to include x < 0. Then d/(dx)ln |x| = 1/x. This gives rise to the familiar integration formula.

Theorem 6.17: Integral of (1/u) du
The natural logarithm is the antiderivative of the function f (u) = 1/u:
724                                                                                                                                 Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

                                                                           1udu = ln |u| + C.

Although we have called our function a "logarithm," we have not actually proved that any of the properties of logarithms
hold for this function. We do so here.

Theorem 6.18: Properties of the Natural Logarithm

If a, b > 0 and r is a rational number, then

     i. ln 1 = 0
     ii. ln(ab) = ln a + ln b

     iii.    ab     =     ln  a  -  ln  b
           ln 

     iv. ln(ar) = r ln a

Proof

i. By definition, ln 1 =            1  1dt = 0.
                                       t
                                    1

ii. We have

              ab                    a            ab
() ln(ab) =  1dt =  1dt +  1dt.
              1t                    1t           at

Use u-substitution on the last integral in this expression. Let u = t/a. Then du = (1/a)dt. Furthermore, when
t = a, u = 1, and when t = ab, u = b. So we get

() ln(ab) =   a  1               ab    1dt       a  1              ab  a     1adt        a  1             b  1udu = ln a + ln b.

   d r rxr - 1 r
() ln(x ) = r = x.
    dx              x

Furthermore,

()  d   (r ln x) =  r.
    dx              x

Since the derivatives of these two functions are the same, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, they must differ by a
constant. So we have

() ln(xr) = r ln x + C

for some constant C. Taking x = 1,             we get

  ln(1r) = r ln(1) + C
() 0 = r(0) + C

       C = 0.

Thus ln(xr) = r ln x and the proof is complete. Note that we can extend this property to irrational values of r later in this
section.
Part iii. follows from parts ii. and iv. and the proof is left to you.

     Using Properties of Logarithms

        Use properties of logarithms to simplify the following expression into a single logarithm:

                                                             ln  9  -   2  ln  3  +  ln13  

                                                                                           .

        Solution
        We have

                        ln  9  -  2  ln  3  +  3 1  =     2  -   2  ln  3  +      -1    =     2  ln  3  -  2  ln  3  -  ln  3  =  -ln  3.

        6.37 Use properties of logarithms to simplify the following expression into a single logarithm:

                                                                 ln  8  -  ln     2  -  ln14  

                                                                                              .

Defining the Number e

Now that we have the natural logarithm defined, we can use that function to define the number e.

    Definition
    The number e is defined to be the real number such that

                                                                  ln e = 1.

To put it another way, the area under the curve y = 1/t between t = 1 and t = e is 1 (Figure 6.77). The proof that such

a number exists and is unique is left to you. (Hint: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove existence and the fact that
ln x is increasing to prove uniqueness.)

     Figure 6.77 The area under the curve from 1 to e is equal
     to one.

The number e can be shown to be irrational, although we won't do so here (see the Student Project in Taylor and
Maclaurin Series (http://cnx.org/content/m53817/latest/) ). Its approximate value is given by

                          e  2.71828182846.

The Exponential Function

We now turn our attention to the function ex. Note that the natural logarithm is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse
function. For now, we denote this inverse function by exp x. Then,

     exp(ln x) = x for x > 0 and ln(exp x) = x for all x.

The following figure shows the graphs of exp x and ln x.

     Figure 6.78 The graphs of ln x and exp x.

We hypothesize that exp x = ex. For rational values of x, this is easy to show. If      x is rational, then we have
ln(ex) = x ln e = x. Thus, when x is rational, ex = exp x. For irrational values of x,  we simply define ex as the
inverse function of ln x.

Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration                                                                        727

Definition              define y = ex to be the number for which
For any real number x,                          ln y = ln(ex) = x.

                                                                                                               (6.25)

Then we have ex = exp(x) for all x, and thus                                                                     (6.26)

for all x.

Properties of the Exponential Function

Since the exponential function was defined in terms of an inverse function, and not in terms of a power of e,
verify that the usual laws of exponents hold for the function ex.

Theorem 6.19: Properties of the Exponential Function
If p and q are any real numbers and r is a rational number, then

     i. e p eq = e p + q
    ii. e qp = e p - q

         e
   iii. (e p)r = e pr

Proof

Note that if p and q are rational, the properties hold. However, if p or q are irrational, we must apply the inverse

function definition of ex and verify the properties. Only the first property is verified here; the other two are left to you. We
have

                                         pq  p        q              p + q
                                         ln(e e ) = ln(e ) + ln(e ) = p + q = lne .

Since ln x is one-to-one, then

                                                              e p eq = e p + q.


As with part iv. of the logarithm properties, we can extend property iii. to irrational values of r, and we do so by the end
of the section.

We also want to verify the differentiation formula for the function y = ex. To do this, we need to use implicit
differentiation. Let y = ex. Then

                                                 ln y = x

                                             d ln y = d x
                                             dx          dx
                                                1 dy = 1
                                                y dx

                                                 dydx = y.

Thus, we see

as desired, which leads immediately to the integration formula

                                           ex dx = ex + C.

We apply these formulas in the following examples.

General Logarithmic and Exponential Functions

We close this section by looking at exponential functions and logarithms with bases other than e. Exponential functions
are functions of the form f (x) = ax. Note that unless a = e, we still do not have a mathematically rigorous definition
of these functions for irrational exponents. Let's rectify that here by defining the function f (x) = ax in terms of the
exponential function ex. We then examine logarithms with bases other than e as inverse functions of exponential
functions.

  Definition
  For any a > 0, and for any real number x, define y = ax as follows:

                                                             y = ax = ex ln a.

Now ax is defined rigorously for all values of x. This definition also allows us to generalize property iv. of logarithms and
property iii. of exponential functions to apply to both rational and irrational values of r. It is straightforward to show that
properties of exponents hold for general exponential functions defined in this way.
Let's now apply this definition to calculate a differentiation formula for ax. We have

                                               d ax = d ex ln a = ex ln a ln a = ax ln a.
                                               dx dx
The corresponding integration formula follows immediately.

  Theorem 6.20: Derivatives and Integrals Involving General Exponential Functions
  Let a > 0. Then,

                                                              d ax = ax ln a
                                                              dx
   and

                                         ax dx = 1 ax + C.

                                                                      ln a

If a  1, then the function ax is one-to-one and has a well-defined inverse. Its inverse is denoted by loga x. Then,

                                                   y = loga x if and only if x = ay.

Note that general logarithm functions can be written in terms of the natural logarithm. Let y = loga x. Then, x = ay.
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of this second equation, we get

                                                              ln x = ln(ay)
                                                              ln x = y ln a

                                                                 y = ln x
                                                                          ln a

                                                            log x = ln x.
                                                                          ln a

Thus, we see that all logarithmic functions are constant multiples of one another. Next, we use this formula to find a
differentiation formula for a logarithm with base a. Again, let y = loga x. Then,

6.8 | Exponential Growth and Decay

                                  Learning Objectives

     6.8.1 Use the exponential growth model in applications, including population growth and
     compound interest.
     6.8.2 Explain the concept of doubling time.
     6.8.3 Use the exponential decay model in applications, including radioactive decay and Newton's
     law of cooling.
     6.8.4 Explain the concept of half-life.

One of the most prevalent applications of exponential functions involves growth and decay models. Exponential growth
and decay show up in a host of natural applications. From population growth and continuously compounded interest to
radioactive decay and Newton's law of cooling, exponential functions are ubiquitous in nature. In this section, we examine
exponential growth and decay in the context of some of these applications.

Exponential Growth Model

Many systems exhibit exponential growth. These systems follow a model of the form y = y0 ekt, where y0 represents

the initial state of the system and k is a positive constant, called the growth constant. Notice that in an exponential growth
model, we have

                          y = ky0 ekt = ky.                                                               (6.27)

That is, the rate of growth is proportional to the current function value. This is a key feature of exponential growth.
Equation 6.27 involves derivatives and is called a differential equation. We learn more about differential equations in
Introduction to Differential Equations (http://cnx.org/content/m53696/latest/) .

Rule: Exponential Growth Model
Systems that exhibit exponential growth increase according to the mathematical model

                                                             y = y0 ekt,
where y0 represents the initial state of the system and k > 0 is a constant, called the growth constant.

Population growth is a common example of exponential growth. Consider a population of bacteria, for instance. It seems
plausible that the rate of population growth would be proportional to the size of the population. After all, the more bacteria
there are to reproduce, the faster the population grows. Figure 6.79 and Table 6.1 represent the growth of a population
of bacteria with an initial population of 200 bacteria and a growth constant of 0.02. Notice that after only 2 hours (120

minutes), the population is 10 times its original size!

Table 6.1 Exponential Growth of a Bacterial Population

Note that we are using a continuous function to model what is inherently discrete behavior. At any given time, the real-world
population contains a whole number of bacteria, although the model takes on noninteger values. When using exponential
736  Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

growth models, we must always be careful to interpret the function values in the context of the phenomenon we are
modeling.

   Example 6.42

     Population Growth

      Consider the population of bacteria described earlier. This population grows according to the function
       f (t) = 200e0.02t, where t is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 5
     hours (300 minutes)? When does the population reach 100,000 bacteria?

     Solution
     We have f (t) = 200e0.02t. Then

                                                   f (300) = 200e0.02(300)  80,686.
     There are 80,686 bacteria in the population after 5 hours.
     To find when the population reaches 100,000 bacteria, we solve the equation

                                                    100,000 = 200e0.02t
                                                         500 = e0.02t

                                                      ln 500 = 0.02t
                                                             t = ln 500  310.73.
                                                                      0.02

     The population reaches 100,000 bacteria after 310.73 minutes.

        6.42 Consider a population of bacteria that grows according to the function f (t) = 500e0.05t, where t is
        measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 4 hours? When does the population
        reach 100 million bacteria?

Let's now turn our attention to a financial application: compound interest. Interest that is not compounded is called simple
interest. Simple interest is paid once, at the end of the specified time period (usually 1 year). So, if we put $1000 in a
savings account earning 2% simple interest per year, then at the end of the year we have

                                                       1000(1 + 0.02) = $1020.
Compound interest is paid multiple times per year, depending on the compounding period. Therefore, if the bank
compounds the interest every 6 months, it credits half of the year's interest to the account after 6 months. During the
second half of the year, the account earns interest not only on the initial $1000, but also on the interest earned during the
first half of the year. Mathematically speaking, at the end of the year, we have

                                                           0.022
                                                    10001 +  = $1020.10.

                                                                   2
Similarly, if the interest is compounded every 4 months, we have

                                                    10001 + 0.023 = $1020.13,
                                                                  3

and if the interest is compounded daily (365 times per year), we have $1020.20. If we extend this concept, so that the
interest is compounded continuously, after t years we have

                                                       0.02nt
                                         1000n lim1 + n  .

Now let's manipulate this expression so that we have an exponential growth function. Recall that the number e can be
expressed as a limit:

                                                                        1 m
                                                          e = mlim1 + m .

Based on this, we want the expression inside the parentheses to have the form (1 + 1/m). Let n = 0.02m. Note that as
n  , m   as well. Then we get

1000 lim 1 + 0.n02nt = 1000 lim 1 + 0.02 0.02mt = 1000 lim 1 + m1 m . 0.02t
n                                        m   0.02m             m    

We recognize the limit inside the brackets as the number e. So, the balance in our bank account after t years is given by
1000e0.02t. Generalizing this concept, we see that if a bank account with an initial balance of $P earns interest at a rate
of r%, compounded continuously, then the balance of the account after t years is

                                         Balance = Pert.

Example 6.43

Compound Interest

A 25-year-old student is offered an opportunity to invest some money in a retirement account that pays 5%
annual interest compounded continuously. How much does the student need to invest today to have $1 million
when she retires at age 65 ? What if she could earn 6% annual interest compounded continuously instead?

Solution
We have

                                                1,000,000 = Pe0.05(40)
                                                          P = 135,335.28.

She must invest $135,335.28 at 5% interest.

If, instead, she is able to earn 6%, then the equation becomes

                                                 1,000,000 = Pe0.06(40)
                                                           P = 90,717.95.

In this case, she needs to invest only $90,717.95. This is roughly two-thirds the amount she needs to invest at
5%. The fact that the interest is compounded continuously greatly magnifies the effect of the 1% increase in
interest rate.

If a quantity grows exponentially, the time it takes for the quantity to double remains constant. In other words, it takes the
same amount of time for a population of bacteria to grow from 100 to 200 bacteria as it does to grow from 10,000 to
20,000 bacteria. This time is called the doubling time. To calculate the doubling time, we want to know when the quantity
reaches twice its original size. So we have

Definition
If a quantity grows exponentially, the doubling time is the amount of time it takes the quantity to double. It is given
by

                                                      Doubling time = ln 2.
                                                                             k

Example 6.44

  Using the Doubling Time

   Assume a population of fish grows exponentially. A pond is stocked initially with 500 fish. After 6 months,
   there are 1000 fish in the pond. The owner will allow his friends and neighbors to fish on his pond after the fish
   population reaches 10,000. When will the owner's friends be allowed to fish?

   Solution
   We know it takes the population of fish 6 months to double in size. So, if t represents time in months,
   by the doubling-time formula, we have 6 = (ln 2)/k. Then, k = (ln 2)/6. Thus, the population is given by
   y = 500e . (ln 2)/6t To figure out when the population reaches 10,000 fish, we must solve the following
   equation:

                                                 10,000 = 500e(ln 2/6)t
                                                       20 = e(ln 2/6)t

                                                    ln 20 = ln 2t
                                                                 6

                                                         t = 6(ln 20)  25.93.
                                                                   ln 2

   The owner's friends have to wait 25.93 months (a little more than 2 years) to fish in the pond.

        6.44 Suppose it takes 9 months for the fish population in Example 6.44 to reach 1000 fish. Under these
        circumstances, how long do the owner's friends have to wait?

Exponential Decay Model

Exponential functions can also be used to model populations that shrink (from disease, for example), or chemical
compounds that break down over time. We say that such systems exhibit exponential decay, rather than exponential growth.
The model is nearly the same, except there is a negative sign in the exponent. Thus, for some positive constant k, we have
y = y0 e-kt.
As with exponential growth, there is a differential equation associated with exponential decay. We have

                                                         y = -ky0 e-kt = -ky.

  Rule: Exponential Decay Model
   Systems that exhibit exponential decay behave according to the model

                                                               y = y0 e-kt,
  where y0 represents the initial state of the system and k > 0 is a constant, called the decay constant.

The following figure shows a graph of a representative exponential decay function.

                                         Figure 6.80 An example of exponential decay.

Let's look at a physical application of exponential decay. Newton's law of cooling says that an object cools at a rate
proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the surroundings. In other words,
if T represents the temperature of the object and Ta represents the ambient temperature in a room, then

                                                            T = -k(T - Ta).

Note that this is not quite the right model for exponential decay. We want the derivative to be proportional to the function,
and this expression has the additional Ta term. Fortunately, we can make a change of variables that resolves this issue. Let
y(t) = T(t) - Ta. Then y(t) = T(t) - 0 = T(t), and our equation becomes

                                         y = -ky.

From our previous work, we know this relationship between y and its derivative leads to exponential decay. Thus,

                                         y = y0 e-kt,

and we see that

                                                        -kt
                                         T - Ta = T0 - Tae

                                                        -kt
                                         T = T0 - Tae + Ta

where T0 represents the initial temperature. Let's apply this formula in the following example.

Newton's Law of Cooling

Suppose coffee is poured at a temperature of 200°F, and after 2 minutes in a 70°F room it has cooled to
740                                                                                   Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

     180°F. When is the coffee first cool enough to serve? When is the coffee too cold to serve? Round answers to
     the nearest half minute.

     Solution
     We have

                                                             -kt
                                    T = T0 - Tae + Ta

                                    180 = (200 - 70)e-k(2) + 70

                                    110 = 130e-2k

                                       11 = e-2k
                                       13
                                    ln 11 = -2k
                                       13

                                    ln 11 - ln 13 = -2k
                                                  k = ln 13 - ln 11.
                                                                 2

     Then, the model is

                                    T = 130e  ln 11 - ln 13t2  + 70.

     The coffee reaches 175°F when

                                    175 = 130e         ln 11 - ln 13t2          + 70

                                    105 = 130e         ln 11 - ln 13t2        

                                    21            ln 11 - ln 13t2
                                    26 = e

                                    ln 21 = ln 11 - ln 13t2
                                    26

                                    ln 21 - ln 26 = ln 11 - ln 13t
                                                                 2

                                                  t = 2(ln 21 - ln 26)  2.56.
                                                            ln 11 - ln 13

     The coffee can be served about 2.5 minutes after it is poured. The coffee reaches 155°F at

                                    155 = 130e         ln 11 - ln 13t2          + 70

                                    85 = 130e          ln 11 - ln 13t2        

                                    17            ln 11 - ln 13t2
                                    26 = e
                                    ln 17 - ln 26 = ln 11 - ln 13t
                                                         2        

                                    t = 2(ln 17 - ln 26)  5.09.
                                             ln 11 - ln 13

     The coffee is too cold to be served about 5 minutes after it is poured.

        6.45 Suppose the room is warmer (75°F) and, after 2 minutes, the coffee has cooled only to 185°F. When
        is the coffee first cool enough to serve? When is the coffee be too cold to serve? Round answers to the nearest

Just as systems exhibiting exponential growth have a constant doubling time, systems exhibiting exponential decay have a
constant half-life. To calculate the half-life, we want to know when the quantity reaches half its original size. Therefore, we
have

                                                               y0 = y0 e-kt

                                                                 1 = e-kt
                                                                 2
                                                            -ln 2 = -kt

                                                                 t = ln 2.

Note: This is the same expression we came up with for doubling time.

Definition

If a quantity decays exponentially, the half-life is the amount of time it takes the quantity to be reduced by half. It is
given by

                                                          Half-life = ln 2.
                                                                          k

  Radiocarbon Dating

One of the most common applications of an exponential decay model is carbon dating. Carbon-14 decays (emits
a radioactive particle) at a regular and consistent exponential rate. Therefore, if we know how much carbon was
originally present in an object and how much carbon remains, we can determine the age of the object. The half-
life of carbon-14 is approximately 5730 years--meaning, after that many years, half the material has converted
from the original carbon-14 to the new nonradioactive nitrogen-14. If we have 100 g carbon-14 today, how

much is left in 50 years? If an artifact that originally contained 100 g of carbon now contains 10 g of carbon,
how old is it? Round the answer to the nearest hundred years.

Solution
We have

                                         5730 = ln 2
                                                       k

                                             k = ln 2 .
                                                      5730

So, the model says

                                         y = 100e-(ln 2/5730)t.

In 50 years, we have

                                                 y = 100e-(ln 2/5730)(50)
                                                      99.40.

Therefore, in 50 years, 99.40 g of carbon-14 remains.
To determine the age of the artifact, we must solve

                                              10 = 100e-(ln 2/5730)t
                                              1 = e-(ln 2/5730)t
                                              10

                                                t  19035.

     The artifact is about 19,000 years old.

     6.46 If we have 100 g of carbon-14, how much is left after t years? If an artifact that originally contained
     100 g of carbon now contains 20g of carbon, how old is it? Round the answer to the nearest hundred years.

6.9.3 Describe the common applied conditions of a catenary curve.

We were introduced to hyperbolic functions in Introduction to Functions and Graphs, along with some of their basic
properties. In this section, we look at differentiation and integration formulas for the hyperbolic functions and their inverses.

Derivatives and Integrals of the Hyperbolic Functions

Recall that the hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine are defined as

                                         2sinh x = ex - e-x and cosh x = ex + e-x.2

The other hyperbolic functions are then defined in terms of sinh x and cosh x. The graphs of the hyperbolic functions are
shown in the following figure.

 Figure 6.81 Graphs of the hyperbolic functions.
It is easy to develop differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. For example, looking at sinh x we have
746                                                                                    Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

                                          d (sinh x)     d ex - e-x
                                          dx          = dx 2 

                                                      = 1 d (ex) - d (e-x)
                                                      2dx                         dx 

                                                      = 1[ex + e-x] = cosh x.
                                                         2

Similarly, (d/dx)cosh x = sinh x. We summarize the differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions in the following
table.

                                          Hyperbolic Functions

Let's take a moment to compare the derivatives of the hyperbolic functions with the derivatives of the standard
trigonometric functions. There are a lot of similarities, but differences as well. For example, the derivatives of the sine
functions match: (d/dx)sin x = cos x and (d/dx)sinh x = cosh x. The derivatives of the cosine functions, however, differ
in sign: (d/dx)cos x = -sin x, but (d/dx)cosh x = sinh x. As we continue our examination of the hyperbolic functions,
we must be mindful of their similarities and differences to the standard trigonometric functions.

These differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions lead directly to the following integral formulas.

                     sinh u du = cosh u + C                csch2 u du = -coth u + C
                    cosh u du = sinh u + C             sech u tanh u du = -sech u + C
                    sech2 u du = tanh u + C            csch u coth u du = -csch u + C

b.  tanh x dx

Solution
We can use u-substitution in both cases.

a. Let u = x2. Then, du = 2x dx and

                                           x         2  =    21cosh u  du  =  21sinh  u  +  C  =  21 sinhx 2 +  C.

b. Let u = cosh x. Then, du = sinh x dx and

                                          tanh x dx =  sinh x dx =  1udu = ln|u| + C = ln|cosh x| + C.

                                                             cosh x

    Note that cosh x > 0 for all x, so we can eliminate the absolute value signs and obtain

Calculus of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions

Looking at the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, we see that with appropriate range restrictions, they all have inverses.
Most of the necessary range restrictions can be discerned by close examination of the graphs. The domains and ranges of
the inverse hyperbolic functions are summarized in the following table.

Figure 6.82 Graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions.

To find the derivatives of the inverse functions, we use implicit differentiation. We have

                                                         y = sinh-1 x

                                             sinh y = x

                                         d sinh y = d x
                                         dx                 dx
                                         cosh ydy = 1.
                                             dx

Recall that cosh2 y - sinh2 y = 1, so cosh y = 1 + sinh2 y. Then,

                                         dy = 1 =        1         = 1.

We can derive differentiation formulas for the other inverse hyperbolic functions in a similar fashion. These differentiation
formulas are summarized in the following table.

Applications

One physical application of hyperbolic functions involves hanging cables. If a cable of uniform density is suspended
between two supports without any load other than its own weight, the cable forms a curve called a catenary. High-voltage
power lines, chains hanging between two posts, and strands of a spider's web all form catenaries. The following figure
shows chains hanging from a row of posts.

Figure 6.83 Chains between these posts take the shape of a catenary. (credit: modification of work by OKFoundryCompany,
Flickr)
Hyperbolic functions can be used to model catenaries. Specifically, functions of the form y = a cosh(x/a) are catenaries.
Figure 6.84 shows the graph of y = 2 cosh(x/2).

  Using a Catenary to Find the Length of a Cable

Assume a hanging cable has the shape 10 cosh(x/10) for -15  x  15, where x is measured in feet.
Determine the length of the cable (in feet).

Solution
Recall from Section 2.4 that the formula for arc length is

                                                               b               (x)2
                                                                          
                                         Arc Length = a           1  +      f        dx.

We have f (x) = 10 cosh(x/10), so f (x) = sinh(x/10). Then

                                                            b             (x)2
                                                                     
                                         Arc Length   =a       1  +    f        dx

                                                      =  1 + sinh 15 2  x  dx.

Now recall that 1 + sinh2 x = cosh2 x, so we have

Arc Length                               =  1 + sinh 15 2  x  dx
                                         -15              10

                                         =  cosh 15  x dx

       expressed in terms of mass per unit length; an area density, expressed in terms of mass per unit area; or a volume
       density, expressed in terms of mass per unit volume; weight-density is also used to describe weight (rather than mass)
       per unit volume

KEY CONCEPTS

6.1 Areas between Curves

     · Just as definite integrals can be used to find the area under a curve, they can also be used to find the area between
        two curves.

     · To find the area between two curves defined by functions, integrate the difference of the functions.

     · If the graphs of the functions cross, or if the region is complex, use the absolute value of the difference of the
        functions. In this case, it may be necessary to evaluate two or more integrals and add the results to find the area of
        the region.

     · Sometimes it can be easier to integrate with respect to y to find the area. The principles are the same regardless of
        which variable is used as the variable of integration.

6.2 Determining Volumes by Slicing

     · Definite integrals can be used to find the volumes of solids. Using the slicing method, we can find a volume by
         integrating the cross-sectional area.

     · For solids of revolution, the volume slices are often disks and the cross-sections are circles. The method of disks
         involves applying the method of slicing in the particular case in which the cross-sections are circles, and using the
         formula for the area of a circle.

     · If a solid of revolution has a cavity in the center, the volume slices are washers. With the method of washers, the
         area of the inner circle is subtracted from the area of the outer circle before integrating.

6.3 Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells

     · The method of cylindrical shells is another method for using a definite integral to calculate the volume of a solid of
         revolution. This method is sometimes preferable to either the method of disks or the method of washers because we
         integrate with respect to the other variable. In some cases, one integral is substantially more complicated than the

   other.

· The geometry of the functions and the difficulty of the integration are the main factors in deciding which integration
   method to use.

6.4 Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area

     · The arc length of a curve can be calculated using a definite integral.
     · The arc length is first approximated using line segments, which generates a Riemann sum. Taking a limit then gives

         us the definite integral formula. The same process can be applied to functions of y.

     · The concepts used to calculate the arc length can be generalized to find the surface area of a surface of revolution.
     · The integrals generated by both the arc length and surface area formulas are often difficult to evaluate. It may be

         necessary to use a computer or calculator to approximate the values of the integrals.

6.5 Physical Applications

     · Several physical applications of the definite integral are common in engineering and physics.
     · Definite integrals can be used to determine the mass of an object if its density function is known.
     · Work can also be calculated from integrating a force function, or when counteracting the force of gravity, as in a

         pumping problem.
     · Definite integrals can also be used to calculate the force exerted on an object submerged in a liquid.

6.6 Moments and Centers of Mass

· Mathematically, the center of mass of a system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be
   concentrated without changing the moment. Loosely speaking, the center of mass can be thought of as the balancing
   point of the system.

· For point masses distributed along a number line, the moment of the system with respect to the origin is

          n

M =  mi xi. For point masses distributed in a plane, the moments of the system with respect to the x- and

       i=1

                                         n    n
y-axes, respectively, are Mx =  mi yi and My =  mi xi, respectively.
                                         i=1  i=1

· For a lamina bounded above by a function f (x), the moments of the system with respect to the x- and y-axes,

respectively, are Mx = a 2 dx b f (x)2 and My = a x f (x)dx. b

· The x- and y-coordinates of the center of mass can be found by dividing the moments around the y-axis and around
   the x-axis, respectively, by the total mass. The symmetry principle says that if a region is symmetric with respect to
   a line, then the centroid of the region lies on the line.

· The theorem of Pappus for volume says that if a region is revolved around an external axis, the volume of the
   resulting solid is equal to the area of the region multiplied by the distance traveled by the centroid of the region.

6.7 Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms

     · The earlier treatment of logarithms and exponential functions did not define the functions precisely and formally.
         This section develops the concepts in a mathematically rigorous way.

     · The cornerstone of the development is the definition of the natural logarithm in terms of an integral.
     · The function ex is then defined as the inverse of the natural logarithm.
     · General exponential functions are defined in terms of ex, and the corresponding inverse functions are general

         logarithms.
760                                                                               Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration

     · Familiar properties of logarithms and exponents still hold in this more rigorous context.

6.8 Exponential Growth and Decay

     · Exponential growth and exponential decay are two of the most common applications of exponential functions.
     · Systems that exhibit exponential growth follow a model of the form y = y0 ekt.
     · In exponential growth, the rate of growth is proportional to the quantity present. In other words, y = ky.
     · Systems that exhibit exponential growth have a constant doubling time, which is given by (ln 2)/k.
     · Systems that exhibit exponential decay follow a model of the form y = y0 e-kt.
     · Systems that exhibit exponential decay have a constant half-life, which is given by (ln 2)/k.

6.9 Calculus of the Hyperbolic Functions

     · Hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions.
     · Term-by-term differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. These differentiation

         formulas give rise, in turn, to integration formulas.
     · With appropriate range restrictions, the hyperbolic functions all have inverses.
     · Implicit differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the inverse hyperbolic functions, which in turn give rise

         to integration formulas.
     · The most common physical applications of hyperbolic functions are calculations involving catenaries.

the amount of prey is extremely small, the rate at which predator growth is increasing is increasing, but when the amount of prey
reaches above a certain threshold, the rate at which predator growth is increasing begins to decrease. d. At lower levels of prey,
the prey is more easily able to avoid detection by the predator, so fewer prey individuals are consumed, resulting in less predator
growth.

53. If           is a subinterval of             under one of the left-endpoint sum rectangles, then the area of the rectangle contributing to

the left-endpoint estimate is f (c)(d - c). But, f (c)  f (x) for c  x  d, so the area under the graph of f between c and d is

f (c)(d - c) plus the area below the graph of f but above the horizontal line segment at height f (c), which is positive. As this

is true for each left-endpoint sum interval, it follows that the left Riemann sum is less than or equal to the area below the graph of

f on a, b.
