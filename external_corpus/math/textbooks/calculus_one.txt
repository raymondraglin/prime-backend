How to Read Mathematics

 Reading mathematics is not the same as reading a novel. To read mathematics you
 need:
(a) A pen.
(b) Plenty of blank paper.
(c) A willingness to write things down.
 As you read mathematics, you must work alongside the text itself. You must write
 down each expression, sketch each graph, and think about what you are doing.
 You should work examples and fill in the details. This is not an easy task; it is in
 fact hard work. However, mathematics is not a passive endeavor. You, the reader,
 must become a doer of mathematics.

0.1 For Each Input, Exactly One Output                                                 Something as simple as a dictionary could be thought
                                                                                       of as a relation, as it connects words to definitions.
Life is complex. Part of this complexity stems from the fact that there are many       However, a dictionary is not a function, as there

                                                                                       it would be a function.
    A function is a relation between sets of objects that can be thought of as a
"mathematical machine." This means for each input, there is exactly one output.        While the name of the function is technically "f ," we
Let's say this explicitly.                                                             will abuse notation and call the function "f (x)" to
                                                                                       remind the reader that it is a function.
   Definition A function is a relation between sets, where for each input, there
   is exactly one output.

    Moreover, whenever we talk about functions, we should try to explicitly state
what type of things the inputs are and what type of things the outputs are. In
calculus, functions often define a relation from (a subset of) the real numbers to (a
subset of) the real numbers.

    Example 0.1.1 Consider the function f that maps from the real numbers to
    the real numbers by taking a number and mapping it to its cube:

                                                 11
                                               -2  -8

                                                                                                          calculus 9

and so on. This function can be described by the formula f (x) = x3 or by the
plot shown in Figure 1.

Warning A function is a relation (such that for each input, there is exactly one                     y
output) between sets and should not be confused with either its formula or its                     5
plot.
                                                                                                                                                 x
· A formula merely describes the mapping using algebra.

· A plot merely describes the mapping using pictures.

                                                                                    -2      -1               1                                2

Example 0.1.2 Consider the greatest integer function, denoted by

                       f (x) = x.                                                                  -5

    This is the function that maps any real number x to the greatest integer less   Figure 1: A plot of f (x) = x3. Here we can see that
    than or equal to x. See Figure 2 for a plot of this function. Some might be     for each input (a value on the x-axis), there is exactly
    confused because here we have multiple inputs that give the same output.        one output (a value on the y-axis).
    However, this is not a problem. To be a function, we merely need to check that
    for each input, there is exactly one output, and this is satisfied.                                           y
                                                                                                               3
    Just to remind you, a function maps from one set to another. We call the set a
function is mapping from the domain or source and we call the set a function is                 2
mapping to the range or target. In our previous examples the domain and range
have both been the real numbers, denoted by R. In our next examples we show that                1
this is not always the case.
                                                                                    -2  -1             1  2     3                             4  x
    Example 0.1.3 Consider the function that maps non-negative real numbers
    to their positive square root. This function is denoted by                              -1

                                                         
                                                f (x) = x.

Note, since this is a function, and its range consists of the non-negative real                           -2

numbers, we have that                                                               Figure 2: A plot of f (x) = x. Here we can see that
                         x2 = |x|.                                                  for each input (a value on the x-axis), there is exactly
                                                                                    one output (a value on the y-axis).

   See Figure 3 for a plot of f (x) = x.
    Finally, we will consider a function whose domain is all real numbers except for              2
a single point.

    Example 0.1.4 Consider the function defined by                                                                     -2
                                           f (x) = x2 - 3x + 2
                                                        x -2

   This function may seem innocent enough; however, it is undefined at x = 2.
    See Figure 4 for a plot of this function.

                                                                                                                        -4

If a function maps every input to exactly one output, an inverse of that function     Here we abuse notation slightly, allowing v and t to
maps every "output" to exactly one "input." While this might sound somewhat           simultaneously be names of variables and functions.
esoteric, let's see if we can ground this in some real-life contexts.                 This is standard practice in calculus classes.

Example 0.2.1 Suppose that you are filling a swimming pool using a garden
hose--though because it rained last night, the pool starts with some water in
it. The volume of water in gallons after t hours of filling the pool is given by:

                           v(t) = 700t + 200

What does the inverse of this function tell you? What is the inverse of this
function?

Solution While v(t) tells you how many gallons of water are in the pool after
a period of time, the inverse of v(t) tells you how much time must be spent to
obtain a given volume. To compute the inverse function, first set v = v(t) and
write

                                         v = 700t + 200.

Now solve for t:

                           t = v/700 - 2/7

This is a function that maps volumes to times, and t(v) = v/700 - 2/7.

Now let's consider a different example.

Example 0.2.2 Suppose you are standing on a bridge that is 60 meters above
sea-level. You toss a ball up into the air with an initial velocity of 30 meters
per second. If t is the time (in seconds) after we toss the ball, then the height
at time t is approximately h(t) = -5t2 + 30t + 60. What does the inverse of this
function tell you? What is the inverse of this function?

Solution While h(t) tells you how the height the ball is above sea-level at an
instant of time, the inverse of h(t) tells you what time it is when the ball is at a
given height. There is only one problem: There is no function that is the inverse
14

    of h(t). Consider Figure 7, we can see that for some heights--namely 60 meters,             h
    there are two times.                                                                  100

       While there is no inverse function for h(t), we can find one if we restrict the    80
    domain of h(t). Take it as given that the maximum of h(t) is at 105 meters and
    t = 3 seconds, later on in this course you'll know how to find points like this with  60
    ease. In this case, we may find an inverse of h(t) on the interval [3, ). Write

                                      h = -5t2 + 30t + 60
                                      0 = -5t2 + 30t + (60 - h)

                                                                                          40

    and solve for t using the quadratic formula

    t = -30 ±  302 - 4(-5)(60 - h)                                                        20
                  2(-5)

    = -30 ±    302 + 20(60 - h)                                                                    2                             4  6               t
                 -10
                                                                                          Figure 7: A plot of h(t) = -5t2 + 30t + 60. Here we
    = 3  32 + .2(60 - h)
                                                                                          can see that for each input (a value on the t-axis),

    = 3  9 + .2(60 - h)                                                                   there is exactly one output (a value on the h-axis).
            
                                                                                          However, for each value on the h axis, sometimes
    = 3  21 - .2h
                                                                                          there are two values on the t-axis. Hence there is no

                                                                                          function that is the inverse of h(t).
                                                                                                  h

    Now we must think about what it means to restrict the domain of h(t) to values        100
    of t in [3, ). Since h(t) has its maximum value of 105 when t = 3, the largest
                                                                                          80
                                                                                 
    h could be is 105. This means that 21 - .2h  0 and so 21 - .2h is a real              60
    number. We know something else too, t > 3. This means that the "" that
    we see above must be a "+." So the inverse of h(t) on the interval [3, ) is

                  
    t(h) = 3 + 21 - .2h. A similar argument will show that the inverse of h(t) on

                                               
    the interval (-, 3] is t(h) = 3 - 21 - .2h.

                                                                                          40

    We see two different cases with our examples above. To clearly describe the 20
difference we need a definition.

Definition A function is one-to-one if for every value in the range, there is                      2                             4  6               t
exactly one value in the domain.
                                                                                          Figure 8: A plot of h(t) = -5t2 + 30t + 60. While

                                                                                          this plot passes the vertical line test, and hence

                                                                                          represents h as a function of t, it does not pass the

                                                                                          horizontal line test, so the function is not one-to-one.
                                                                                                                    calculus 15

    You may recall that a plot gives y as a function of x if every vertical line crosses               y
the plot at most once, this is commonly known as the vertical line test. A function is               2
one-to-one if every horizontal line crosses the plot at most once, which is commonly
known as the horizontal line test, see Figure 8. We can only find an inverse to a                    1                 f -1(x)
function when it is one-to-one, otherwise we must restrict the domain as we did in
Example 0.2.2.                                                                            -2  -1                    1                             2  x

    Let's look at several examples.                                                           f (x)

    Example 0.2.3 Consider the function                                                              -1

                                                f (x) = x3.                                                                 -2
                                                                                          Figure 9: A plot of f (x) = x3 and f -1(x) = 3 x. Note
   Does f (x) have an inverse? If so what is it? If not, attempt to restrict the          f -1(x) is the image of f (x) after being flipped over
   domain of f (x) and find an inverse on the restricted domain.                          the line y = x.
   Solution In this case f (x) is one-to-one and f -1(x) = 3 x. See Figure 9.
                                                                                                                                     y
    Example 0.2.4 Consider the function                                                                                           2

                                                f (x) = x2.                                                      1     f -1(x)
                                                                                              f (x)
   Does f (x) have an inverse? If so what is it? If not, attempt to restrict the

   Solution In this case f (x) is not one-to-one. However, it is one-to-one on the
   interval [0, ). Hence we can find an inverse of f (x) = x2 on this interval, and it

                                  
    is our familiar function x. See Figure 10.

0.2.1 A Word on Notation                                                                             -1

Given a function f (x), we have a way of writing an inverse of f (x), assuming it exists

                    f -1(x) = the inverse of f (x), if it exists.                                                           -2
                                                                                          Figure 10: A plot of f (x) = x2 and f -1(x) = x.
On the other hand,        f (x)-1 = 1 .                                                   While f (x) = x2 is not one-to-one on R, it is one-to-
                                     f (x)
                                                                                          one on [0, ).

   Warning It is not usually the case that
                                            f -1(x) = f (x)-1.

    This confusing notation is often exacerbated by the fact that
                      sin2(x) = (sin(x))2 but sin-1(x) (sin(x))-1.

    In the case of trigonometric functions, this confusion can be avoided by using
the notation arcsin and so on for other trigonometric functions.

1.1 The Basic Ideas of Limits

                                                                                                                    -2

Consider the function:         f (x) = x2 - 3x + 2
                                            x -2
                                                                                                                               -3
While f (x) is undefined at x = 2, we can still plot f (x) at other values, see Figure 1.1.              Figure 1.1: A plot of f (x) = x2 - 3x + 2 .

                                                                                                                                                 x -2

Examining Table 1.1, we see that as x approaches 2, f (x) approaches 1. We write

this:

                        As x  2, f (x)  1 or lim f (x) = 1.                                              x      f (x)      x      f (x)
                                                                                                         1.7    0.7        2      undefined
                                                                                x 2                      1.9    0.9        2.001  1.001
                                                                                                         1.99   0.99       2.01   1.01
Intuitively, lim f (x) = L when the value of f (x) can be made arbitrarily close to L                    1.999  0.999      2.1    1.1
                                                                                                         2      undefined  2.3    1.3
                      x a

by making x sufficiently close, but not equal to, a. This leads us to the formal

definition of a limit.

Definition The limit of f (x) as x goes to a is L,                                                       Table 1.1: Values of f (x) = x2 - 3x + 2 .
                                           lim f (x) = L,                                                                                        x -2

                                                              x a                                        Equivalently, lim f (x) = L, if for every  > 0 there is

if for every  > 0 there is a  > 0 so that whenever                                                                               x a
                      0 < |x - a| < , we have |f (x) - L| < .
                                                                                                         a  > 0 so that whenever x a and a -  < x < a + ,
If no such value of L can be found, then we say that lim f (x) does not exist.                           we have L -  < f (x) < L + .

                                                                                                    x a

In Figure 1.2, we see a geometric interpretation of this definition.
Limits need not exist, let's examine two cases of this.

         y                                                                           that a -  < x < a + . In our diagram, we see that
L +                                                                                  for all such x we are sure to have L -  < f (x) < L + ,
                                                                                     and hence |f (x) - L| < .

                 a- a a+

Example 1.1.1 Let f (x) = x. Explain why the limit                                             y
                                                                                             3

                 lim f (x)

                 x 2

does not exist.                                                                              2

Solution The function x is the function that returns the greatest integer less               1
than or equal to x. Since f (x) is defined for all real numbers, one might be
tempted to think that the limit above is simply f (2) = 2. However, this is not the  -2  -1       1  2  3                                       4  x
case. If x < 2, then f (x) = 1. Hence if  = .5, we can always find a value for x
(just to the left of 2) such that

                                                                                             -1

                 0 < |x - 2| < , where  < |f (x) - 2|.

On the other hand, lim f (x) 1, as in this case if  = .5, we can always find a                             -2

                                    x 2                                              Figure 1.3: A plot of f (x) = x. Note, no matter
                                                                                     which  > 0 is chosen, we can only at best bound
value for x (just to the right of 2) such that                                       f (x) in the interval [1, 2]. With the example of f (x) =
                                                                                     x, we see that taking limits is truly different from
                 0 < |x - 2| < , where  < |f (x) - 1|.                               evaluating functions.

We've illustrated this in Figure 1.3. Moreover, no matter what value one chooses
                                                                                                         calculus 21

   for lim f (x), we will always have a similar issue.                                                y

           x 2                                                                                  -0.1                                                 x
                                                                                          -0.2                                             0.1       0.2
    Limits may not exist even if the formula for the function looks innocent.
   Example 1.1.2 Let f (x) = sin 1 . Explain why the limit                                Figure 1.4: A plot of f (x) = sin 1 .
                                                                                                                                        x
                                                 x
                                                  lim f (x)                               Limits from the left, or from the right, are collectively
                                                                                          called one-sided limits.
                                                                       x 0

    does not exist.

   Solution In this case f (x) oscillates "wildly" as x approaches 0, see Figure 1.4.
    In fact, one can show that for any given , There is a value for x in the interval

                                           0-<x<0+
   such that f (x) is any value in the interval [-1, 1]. Hence the limit does not exist.

    Sometimes the limit of a function exists from one side or the other (or both)
even though the limit does not exist. Since it is useful to be able to talk about this
situation, we introduce the concept of a one-sided limit:

   Definition We say that the limit of f (x) as x goes to a from the left is L,

                                               lim f (x) = L

                                                                  x a -

   if for every  > 0 there is a  > 0 so that whenever x < a and
                             a -  < x we have |f (x) - L| < .

      We say that the limit of f (x) as x goes to a from the right is L,

                                               lim f (x) = L

                                                                  x a +

   if for every  > 0 there is a  > 0 so that whenever x > a and
                             x < a +  we have |f (x) - L| < .

    Example 1.1.3 Let f (x) = x. Discuss

    lim f (x), lim f (x), and lim f (x).
    x 2-  x 2+                            x 2

    Solution From the plot of f (x), see Figure 1.3, we see that

    lim f (x) = 1,  and lim f (x) = 2.

    x 2-                       x 2+

    Since these limits are different, lim f (x) does not exist.

1.2 Limits by the Definition

Now we are going to get our hands dirty, and really use the definition of a limit.     Recall, lim f (x) = L, if for every  > 0 there is a
   Example 1.2.1 Show that lim x2 = 4.
                                                                                                    x a
                                                         x 2
                                                                                        > 0 so that whenever 0 < |x - a| < , we have
                                                                                       |f (x) - L| < .

Solution We want to show that for any given  > 0, we can find a  > 0 such                      y
that
                                                                                       4+
                                            |x2 - 4| <                                      4

whenever 0 < |x - 2| < . Start by factoring the left-hand side of the inequality       4-
above

                                        |x + 2||x - 2| < .

Since we are going to assume that 0 < |x - 2| < , we will focus on the factor
|x + 2|. Since x is assumed to be close to 2, suppose that x  [1, 3]. In this case

                                       |x + 2|  3 + 2 = 5,

and so we want

                                          5 · |x - 2| <                                                                                                                             x
                                              |x - 2| <                                                                   2- 2 2+
                                                                5                      Figure 1.6: The (, )-criterion for lim x2 = 4. Here

Recall, we assumed that x  [1, 3], which is equivalent to |x - 2|  1. Hence we                                                                      x 2
must set  = min  , 1 .
                                                                                        = min  , 1 .
                          5                                                                         5

    When dealing with limits of polynomials, the general strategy is always the same.
Let p(x) be a polynomial. If showing

                                              lim p(x) = L,

                                                                  x a

one must first factor out |x - a| from |p(x) - L|. Next bound x  [a - 1, a + 1] and
estimate the largest possible value of

                                                 p(x) - L
                                                   x -a
26

for x  [a - 1, a + 1], call this estimation M. Finally, one must set  = min  , 1 .
                                                                                                               M

    As you work with limits, you find that you need to do the same procedures again
and again. The next theorems will expedite this process.

Theorem 1.2.2 (Limit Product Law) Suppose lim f (x) = L and lim g(x) = M.
                               x a                                  x a
Then

         lim f (x)g(x) = LM.

         x a

Proof Given any  we need to find a  such that

         0 < |x - a| < 

implies

         |f (x)g(x) - LM| < .

Here we use an algebraic trick, add 0 = -f (x)M + f (x)M:                                                         We will use this same trick again of "adding 0" in the
                                                                                                                  proof of Theorem 5.1.1.
         |f (x)g(x) - LM| = |f (x)g(x)-f (x)M + f (x)M - LM|
                             = |f (x)(g(x) - M) + (f (x) - L)M|                                                   This is all straightforward except perhaps for the
                              |f (x)(g(x) - M)| + |(f (x) - L)M|                                                  "". This follows from the Triangle Inequality. The
                             = |f (x)||g(x) - M| + |f (x) - L||M|.                                                Triangle Inequality states: If a and b are any real
                                                                                                                  numbers then |a + b|  |a| + |b|.
Since lim f (x) = L, there is a value 1 so that 0 < |x - a| < 1 implies |f (x) - L| <

          x a

|/(2M)|. This means that 0 < |x - a| < 1 implies |f (x) - L||M| < /2.

                    |f (x)g(x) - LM|  |f (x)||g(x) - M| + |f (x) - L||M| .
                                                                                 

                                                                               <2

If we can make |f (x)||g(x) - M| < /2, then we'll be done. We can make |g(x) - M|
smaller than any fixed number by making x close enough to a. Unfortunately,
/(2f (x)) is not a fixed number since x is a variable.

   Here we need another trick. We can find a 2 so that |x - a| < 2 implies that
|f (x) - L| < 1, meaning that L - 1 < f (x) < L + 1. This means that |f (x)| < N ,
                                                                                                                                                   calculus 27

where N is either |L - 1| or |L + 1|, depending on whether L is negative or positive.
The important point is that N doesn't depend on x. Finally, we know that there
is a 3 so that 0 < |x - a| < 3 implies |g(x) - M| < /(2N ). Now we're ready to
put everything together. Let  be the smallest of 1, 2, and 3. Then |x - a| < 
implies that

    |f (x)g(x) - LM|  |f (x)| |g(x) - M| + |f (x) - L||M| .

      <N                                               

          < 2N < 2

so

                     |f (x)g(x) - LM|  |f (x)||g(x) - M| + |f (x) - L||M|
                                         < N  +  |M|
                                                    2N 2M
                                         =  +  = .
                                                 22

This is just what we needed, so by the definition of a limit, lim f (x)g(x) = LM.

                                                                                                              x a

Another useful way to put functions together is composition. If f (x) and g(x)

are functions, we can form two functions by composition: f (g(x)) and g(f (x)). For
                                                         2
example, if f (x) = x and g(x) = x + 5, then f (g(x)) = x + 5 and g(f (x)) =2
 2
( x) + 5 = x + 5. This brings us to our next theorem.

Theorem 1.2.3 (Limit Composition Law) Suppose that lim g(x) = M and                                                  This is sometimes written as

                                                                                                                x a  lim f (g(x)) = lim f (g(x)).
                                                                                                                     x a  g(x )M
lim f (x) = f (M). Then

x M

                                       lim f (g(x)) = f (M).

                                                        x a

Warning You may be tempted to think that the condition on f (x) in Theo-
rem 1.2.3 is unneeded, and that it will always be the case that if lim g(x) = M
and lim f (x) = L then xa

        x M

                                         lim f (g(x)) = L.

                                                           x a
28

However, consider          
                           3
                   f (x) =    if x = 2,
                           4  if x 2.

and g(x) = 2. Now the conditions of Theorem 1.2.3 are not satisfied, and

                   lim f (g(x)) = 3 but  lim f (x) = 4.

                   x 1                   x 2

    Many of the most familiar functions do satisfy the conditions of Theorem 1.2.3.
For example:

Theorem 1.2.4 (Limit Root Law) Suppose that n is a positive integer. Then
                                          lim n x = n a,

                                                            x a

1.3 Limit Laws

In this section, we present a handful of tools to compute many limits without
explicitly working with the definition of limit. Each of these could be proved directly
as we did in the previous section.

    Theorem 1.3.1 (Limit Laws) Suppose that lim f (x) = L, lim g(x) = M, k is
                                                 x a           x a
    some constant, and n is a positive integer.

    Constant Law lim kf (x) = k lim f (x) = kL.
                 x a            x a

    Sum Law lim(f (x) + g(x)) = lim f (x) + lim g(x) = L + M.
            x a                 x a  x a

    Product Law lim(f (x)g(x)) = lim f (x) · lim g(x) = LM.
                 x a            x a  x a

    Quotient Law lim f (x) = limxa f (x) = L , if M 0.
                        xa g(x) limxa g(x) M

    Power Law lim f (x)n =                        n            is even,  then f (x)  0

                           x a  lim f (x) = Ln.

    Root Law lim n f (x) =      x a

                         x a                    n
                                n lim f (x) = L provided if n
        near a.
                                  x a

    Composition Law If lim g(x) = M and lim f (x) = f (M), then lim f (g(x)) =
                      x a            x M                                 x a
    f (M).

    Roughly speaking, these rules say that to compute the limit of an algebraic
expression, it is enough to compute the limits of the "innermost bits" and then
combine these limits. This often means that it is possible to simply plug in a value
for the variable, since lim x = a.

                                          x a

   Example 1.3.2 Compute lim x2 - 3x + 5 .
                                      x1 x - 2
Solution Using limit laws,                                                                                                            calculus 31

lim x2 - 3x + 5 = limx1 x2 - 3x + 5                                                           Limits allow us to examine functions where they are
x1 x - 2                    limx1(x - 2)                                                      not defined.

                            = limx1 x2 - limx1 3x + limx1 5
                                       limx1 x - limx1 2

                            = (limx1 x)2 - 3 limx1 x + 5
                                        limx1 x - 2

                               12 - 3 · 1 + 5
                            =

                                    1-2
                            = 1 - 3 + 5 = -3.

                                   -1

   It is worth commenting on the trivial limit lim 5. From one point of view this

                                                                                         x 1

might seem meaningless, as the number 5 can't "approach" any value, since it is
simply a fixed number. But 5 can, and should, be interpreted here as the function
that has value 5 everywhere, f (x) = 5, with graph a horizontal line. From this
point of view it makes sense to ask what happens to the height of the function as x
approaches 1.

    We're primarily interested in limits that aren't so easy, namely limits in which
a denominator approaches zero. The basic idea is to "divide out" by the offending
factor. This is often easier said than done--here we give two examples of algebraic
tricks that work on many of these limits.

Example 1.3.3 Compute lim x2 + 2x - 3 .
                                  x1 x - 1

Solution We can't simply plug in x = 1 because that makes the denominator
zero. However, when taking limits we assume x 1:

lim  x2 + 2x - 3            = lim           (x - 1)(x + 3)

x1 x - 1                    x 1                x -1

                            = lim(x + 3) = 4

                               x 1

    Example 1.3.4 Compute lim       x + 5 - 2  .

                         x-1 x + 1

    Solution  Using limit laws,

              lim        x + 5 - 2  = lim  x + 5 - 2 x + 5 + 2
                                                           
              x-1 x + 1             x-1 x + 1                 x +5+2
                                                                                       Here we are rationalizing the numerator by multiply-
                                    = lim         x +5-4                               ing by the conjugate.
                                                        
                                    x-1 (x + 1)( x + 5 + 2)

                                    = lim               x +1
                                                        
                                    x-1 (x + 1)( x + 5 + 2)

                                                     1     = 1.
                                    = lim 
                                    x-1 x + 5 + 2 4

    We'll conclude with one more theorem that will allow us to compute more difficult
limits.

    Theorem 1.3.5 (Squeeze Theorem) Suppose that g(x)  f (x)  h(x) for all
    x close to a but not necessarily equal to a. If

                                 lim g(x) = L = lim h(x),
                           x a             x a

    then lim f (x) = L.

             x a

                                                                                       rem 7.1.1, and we will give another derivation of
                                                                                       this limit in Example 8.1.2.

note that we only need to examine x  - ,  and for the present time, we'll

                                                            22
assume that x is positive--consider the diagrams below:

v                                                       v                         v

   sin(x )                                                                                                                            tan(x )

              cos(x )                                                                                          Triangle B

                   Triangle A
From our diagrams above we see that

   Area of Triangle A  Area of Sector  Area of Triangle B

and computing these areas we find

            2                      2                       2

Multiplying through by 2, and recalling that tan(x) = sin(x) we obtain
                                                                    cos(x )

   cos(x) sin(x)  x  sin(x) .
                           cos(x )

Dividing through by sin(x) and taking the reciprocals, we find

   cos(x)  sin(x)  1 .
                 x cos(x)

    Note, cos(-x) = cos(x) and sin(-x) = sin(x) , so these inequalities hold for all

        x 0                              x0 cos(x)

    and so we conclude by the Squeeze Theorem, Theorem 1.3.5, lim sin(x) = 1.

                                                                                                       100

2.1 Infinite Limits                                                                                    80

Consider the function                      1

                                  f (x) =         2                                                    60

                                           (x + 1)

While the lim f (x) does not exist, see Figure 2.1, something can still be said.                       40

                   x -1

Definition If f (x) grows arbitrarily large as x approaches a, we write                                20

                                           lim f (x) =                             -2        -1                                     1  x

                                                              x a                      -1.5      -0.5                          0.5

and say that the limit of f (x) approaches infinity as x goes to a.                Figure 2.1: A plot of f (x) = (x + 1)2 1 .
   If |f (x)| grows arbitrarily large as x approaches a and f (x) is negative, we

write
                                          lim f (x) = -

                                                            x a

and say that the limit of f (x) approaches negative infinity as x goes to a.

On the other hand, if we consider the function
                                         f (x) = 1
                                                   (x - 1)

While we have lim f (x) ±, we do have one-sided limits, lim f (x) =  and
                             x 1                            x 1+

lim f (x) = -, see Figure 2.2.

Definition If

      lim f (x) = ±, lim f (x) = ±, or                 lim f (x) = ±,
      x a                x a +
                                                       x a -                                  y
                                                                                          40
then the line x = a is a vertical asymptote of f (x).

Example 2.1.1 Find the vertical asymptotes of                                             20

                                x2 - 9x + 14   .
                         f (x) = 2
                                x - 5x + 6                                                                                                   x

                                                                             -1     -0.5            0.5                1        1.5       2

Solution Start by factoring both the numerator and the denominator:                       -20

                                x2 - 9x + 14 (x - 2)(x - 7)                                      -40
                                 x2 - 5x + 6 ( = x - 2)(x - 3)               Figure 2.2: A plot of f (x) = 1 .

Using limits, we must investigate when x  2 and x  3. Write                                                      x -1

                               lim (x - 2)(x - 7) = lim (x - 7)
                              x2 (x - 2)(x - 3) x2 (x - 3)

                                                      = -5
                                                         -1

                                                      = 5.

Now write

                   lim (x - 2)(x - 7) = lim (x - 7)                              y
                   x3 (x - 2)(x - 3) x3 (x - 3)                              40

                                          = lim -4 .
                                             x3 x - 3

Since lim x - 3 approaches 0 from the right and the numerator is negative,
      x 3+
lim f (x) = -. Since lim x - 3 approaches 0 from the left and the numerator
x 3+               x 3-                                                      20

is negative, lim f (x) = . Hence we have a vertical asymptote at x = 3, see
             x 3-
Figure 2.3.

                                                                                          y

Consider the function:  f (x) = 6x - 9
                                  x -1

As x approaches infinity, it seems like f (x) approaches a specific value. This is a  10

limit at infinity.

Definition If f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to a specific value L by making x                1                                 2       3  x
sufficiently large, we write
                                                                                          0.5     1.5                               2.5
                                            lim f (x) = L
                                                                                       -10

and we say, the limit at infinity of f (x) is L.                                                                           x -1
   If f (x) becomes arbitrarily close to a specific value L by making x sufficiently

large and negative, we write
                                            lim f (x) = L

                                                             x -

and we say, the limit at negative infinity of f (x) is L.

Example 2.2.1 Compute   lim 6x - 9 .
                        x x - 1

Solution Write

                        lim 6x - 9 = lim 6x - 9 1/x
                        x x - 1 x x - 1 1/x

                                                x6x - x9
                                       = lim x 1

                                            x 1

                                       = 6.

Sometimes one must be careful, consider this example.

    Example 2.2.2 Compute         x +1
                            lim 
                           x- x 2

    Solution In this case we multiply the numerator and denominator by -1/x,
    which is a positive number as since x  -, x is a negative number.

                           x +1         x + 1 -1/x

                                 = -1.

    Here is a somewhat different example of a limit at infinity.                       4.5

    Example 2.2.3 Compute  lim sin(7x) + 4.
                           x x
                                                                                       4

    Solution We can bound our function

               -1/x + 4  sin(7x) + 4  1/x + 4.                                         3.5
                                    x

    Since                                                                                                                                  x

               lim -1/x + 4 = 4 = lim 1/x + 4                                                  5  10                                   15  20

    we conclude by the Squeeze Theorem, Theorem 1.3.5, lim sin(7x) + 4 = 4.                                                         x
                                                                                  x x

Definition If

               lim f (x) = L or lim f (x) = L,
               x                        x -

then the line y = L is a horizontal asymptote of f (x).
                                                                                                                                             calculus 41

Example 2.2.4 Give the horizontal asymptotes of
                                          f (x) = 6x - 9
                                                    x -1

Solution From our previous work, we see that lim f (x) = 6, and upon further
                                                 x 
inspection, we see that lim f (x) = 6. Hence the horizontal asymptote of f (x) is
                 x -
the line y = 6.

    It is a common misconception that a function cannot cross an asymptote. As                           y
the next example shows, a function can cross an asymptote, and in this case this                       4
occurs an infinite number of times!

    Example 2.2.5 Give a horizontal asymptote of
                                          f (x) = sin(7x) + 4.
                                                             x

   Solution Again from previous work, we see that lim f (x) = 4. Hence y = 4 is

                                                                                                   x 

   a horizontal asymptote of f (x).

We conclude with an infinite limit at infinity.                                                        3

Example 2.2.6 Compute

                       lim ln(x)                                                                       2

                       x 

Solution The function ln(x) grows very slowly, and seems like it may have a                            1

horizontal asymptote, see Figure 2.6. However, if we consider the definition of

the natural log                                                                                                                                           x

                       ln(x) = y  ey = x                                                                    5  10                            15           20

Since we need to raise e to higher and higher values to obtain larger numbers,                          -1
we see that ln(x) is unbounded, and hence lim ln(x) = .                                                Figure 2.6: A plot of f (x) = ln(x).

Informally, a function is continuous if you can "draw it" without "lifting your pencil."
We need a formal definition.                                                                                      4

Example 2.3.1 Find the discontinuities (the values for x where a function is                                      2

                                                                                                                  1

Solution From Figure 2.7 we see that lim f (x) does not exist as

                                                                         x 4

lim f (x) = 1 and lim f (x)  3.5                                                                                        2                         6                      x

x 4-                                            x 4+

Hence lim f (x) f (4), and so f (x) is not continuous at x = 4.                                                   Figure 2.7: A plot of a function with discontinuities

We also see that lim f (x)  3 while f (6) = 2. Hence lim f (x)                f (6), and so
x 6                                                        x 6
f (x) is not continuous at x = 6.

                                                                                                                                               y

    Building from the definition of continuous at a point, we can now define what it
means for a function to be continuous on an interval.

Definition A function f is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at
every point in the interval.

    In particular, we should note that if a function is not defined on an interval, then                                                                  0.1            x
it cannot be continuous on that interval.                                                                         -0.2  -0.1                                             0.2

Example 2.3.2 Consider the function

                                                                                                                  Figure 2.8: A plot of

see Figure 2.8. Is this function continuous?                                                                                  5 1  x sin       if x 0,
                                                                                                                        f (x) =             x  if x = 0.

                                                                                                                           0
44

    Solution Considering f (x), the only issue is when x = 0. We must show that

    lim f (x) = 0. Note  -| 5 x|  f (x)  | 5 x|.

    x 0

    Since                lim -| 5 x| = 0 = lim | 5 x|,

                         x 0  x 0

    we see by the Squeeze Theorem, Theorem 1.3.5, that lim f (x) = 0. Hence f (x) is

                                                                                                     x 0

    continuous.

    Here we see how the informal definition of continuity being that you can

"draw it" without "lifting your pencil" differs from the formal definition.

    We close with a useful theorem about continuous functions:                                            The Intermediate Value Theorem is most frequently
                                                                                                          used when d = 0.

    there is a number c in [a, b] such that f (c) = d.                                                    and I am going to prove it to you. College Math. J. 42

   Solution By Theorem 1.3.1, lim f (x) = f (a), for all real values of a, and hence                      f (c) = d

   f is continuous. Since f (0) = -2 and f (1) = 3, and 0 is between -2 and 3, by                                a  c                                                    x

   f (c) = 0.                                                                                                                                                         b

    place.                                                                                                [f (a), f (b)], there exists a value c in [a, b] such that
                                                                                                          f (c) = d.
   Solution If we compute f (0.1), f (0.2), and so on, we find that f (0.6) < 0
   and f (0.7) > 0, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, f has a root between
   0.6 and 0.7. Repeating the process with f (0.61), f (0.62), and so on, we find

that f (0.61) < 0 and f (0.62) > 0, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem,
Theorem 2.3.3, f (x) has a root between 0.61 and 0.62, and the root is 0.6

3 Basics of Derivatives

3.1 Slopes of Tangent Lines via Limits

Suppose that f (x) is a function. It is often useful to know how sensitive the value of
f (x) is to small changes in x. To give you a feeling why this is true, consider the
following:
· If p(t) represents the position of an object with respect to time, the rate of change

    gives the velocity of the object.
· If v(t) represents the velocity of an object with respect to time, the rate of change

    gives the acceleration of the object.
· The rate of change of a function can help us approximate a complicated function

    with a simple function.
· The rate of change of a function can be used to help us solve equations that we

    would not be able to solve via other methods.
    The rate of change of a function is the slope of the tangent line. For now, consider
the following informal definition of a tangent line:
    Given a function f (x), if one can "zoom in" on f (x) sufficiently so that f (x) seems to be
    a straight line, then that line is the tangent line to f (x) at the point determined by x.
We illustrate this informal definition with Figure 3.1.
   The derivative of a function f (x) at x, is the slope of the tangent line at x. To find
the slope of this line, we consider secant lines, lines that locally intersect the curve

                                                                                       straight line, then that line is the tangent line to
                                                                                       f (x) at the point determined by x.

at two points. The slope of any secant line that passes through the points (x, f (x))
and (x + h, f (x + h)) is given by

                 y = f (x + h) - f (x) = f (x + h) - f (x) ,
                 x (x + h) - x        h

                                                                                                  y

see Figure 3.2. This leads to the limit definition of the derivative:

Definition of the Derivative The derivative of f (x) is the function

                 d f (x) = lim f (x + h) - f (x) .                                     f (x + h)

                 dx  h0            h

If this limit does not exist for a given value of x, then f (x) is not differentiable
at x.

                                                                                       f (x)

Definition There are several different notations for the derivative, we'll mainly
use

                                          d f (x) = f (x).
                                              dx
If one is working with a function of a variable other than x, say t we write

                                           d f (t) = f (t).
                                               dt

However, if y = f (x), dy , y , and Dx f (x) are also used.
                               dx

Now we will give a number of examples, starting with a basic example.

Example 3.1.1 Compute    d (x3 + 1).

                 = lim  x3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3 + 1 - x3 - 1

                 h0                     h                                                                           y
                                                                                                                 4
                 = lim  3x2h + 3xh2 + h3                                                 f (x)

                 h0      h

                 = lim(3x2 + 3xh + h2)                                                             2

                    h0

                 = 3x2.                                                                                                                      f (x)

See Figure 3.3.                                                                                                                                     x

Proof  We want to show that f (x) is continuous at x = a, hence we must show
that                                   lim f (x) = f (a).

Consider

                                                                                  Limit Law.

Since                                                                                                               y

we see that lim f (x) = f (a), and so f (x) is continuous.

This theorem is often written as its contrapositive:                                                              2
If f (x) is not continuous at x = a, then f (x) is not differentiable at x = a.                                                   f (t)

                                            h
                                   = lim

                                      h0 h

                                   = 1.

If x is negative we may assume that |x| is larger than h, as we are taking the
52

    limit as h goes to 0,

                             lim |x + h| - |x| = lim -x - h + x
                             h0   h                   h0   h

                                     = lim -h
                                        h0 h

                                     = -1.

    However we still have one case left, when x = 0. In this situation, we must
    consider the one-sided limits:

                        lim |x + h| - |x| and lim |x + h| - |x| .
                        h0+  h                            h0-       h

    In the first case,

                             lim |x + h| - |x| = lim 0 + h - 0
                             h0+  h                   h0+        h

                                               h
                                     = lim

                                        h0+ h

                                     = 1.

    On the other hand

                             lim |x + h| - |x| = lim |0 + h| - 0
                             h0-  h                   h0-        h

                                     = lim |h|
                                        h0- h

                                     = -1.

    Hence we see that the derivative is               if x > 0,
                                                      if x < 0.
                                                  
                                                  1
                                         f (x) = 
                                                  -1

    Note this function is undefined at 0, see Figure 3.5.

   Thus from Theorem 3.1.3, we see that all differentiable functions on R are
continuous on R. Nevertheless as the previous example shows, there are continuous
functions on R that are not differentiable on R.

It is tedious to compute a limit every time we need to know the derivative of a                 To gain intuition, you should compute the derivative
function. Fortunately, we can develop a small collection of examples and rules that             of f (x) = 6 using the limit definition of the derivative.
allow us to compute the derivative of almost any function we are likely to encounter.
We will start simply and build-up to more complicated examples.

The Constant Rule
The simplest function is a constant function. Recall that derivatives measure the
rate of change of a function at a given point. Hence, the derivative of a constant
function is zero. For example:

· The constant function plots a horizontal line--so the slope of the tangent line is 0.

· If p(t) represents the position of an object with respect to time and p(t) is constant,
   then the object is not moving, so its velocity is zero. Hence d p(t) = 0.
                                                                                            dt

· If v(t) represents the velocity of an object with respect to time and v(t) is constant,
   then the object's acceleration is zero. Hence d v(t) = 0.
                                                                      dt

The examples above lead us to our next theorem.

    Theorem 3.2.1 (The Constant Rule) Given a constant c,
                                                  d c = 0.
                                                      dx

   Proof From the limit definition of the derivative, write
                                            d c = lim c - c

                                                                0
                                                 = lim

rule.

    Theorem 3.2.2 (The Power Rule) For any real number n,
                                              d xn = nxn-1.
                                                  dx

Proof At this point we will only prove this theorem for n being a positive integer.

Later in Section 6.3, we will give the complete proof. From the limit definition of

the derivative, write      d xn = lim (x + h)n - xn .

                           dx      h0     h                                          Recall, the Binomial Theorem states that if n is a

Start by expanding the term (x + h)n

                                                                                     (a+b)n = an b0+ n an-1b1+· · ·+ n a1bn-1+a0bn

                                                                                               k k!(n - k)!
Note, by the Binomial Theorem, we write n for the coefficients. Canceling the
                                                             k

terms xn and -xn, and noting n = n = n, write
                                        1 n-1

    d xn nxn-1h + = lim 2 n-1 n xn-2h2 + · · · + n xhn-1 + hn

        = lim nxn-1 + n xn-2h + · · · + n xhn-2 + hn-1.
            h0                 2             n-1

Since every term but the first has a factor of h, we see

                       d xn = lim (x + h)n - xn = nxn-1.
                       dx      h0      h

Now we will show you several examples. We begin with something basic.
                                                                                        calculus 57

Example 3.2.3 Compute      d x13.
                           dx

Solution Applying the power rule, we write
                                          d x13 = 13x12.
                                              dx

Sometimes, it is not as obvious that one should apply the power rule.

Example 3.2.4 Compute      d 1.
                           dx x4

Solution Applying the power rule, we write
                                   dx x4 d 1 = ddx x-4 = -4x-5.

The power rule also applies to radicals once we rewrite them as exponents.

Example 3.2.5 Compute      d 5 x.
                           dx

Solution Applying the power rule, we write

                       d 5 x = d x1/5 = x-4/5 .
                       dx  dx                             5

The Sum Rule

We want to be able to take derivatives of functions "one piece at a time." The sum
rule allows us to do this. The sum rule says that we can add the rates of change
of two functions to obtain the rate of change of the sum of both functions. For
example, viewing the derivative as the velocity of an object, the sum rule states that
the velocity of the person walking on a moving bus is the sum of the velocity of the
bus and the walking person.

Proof We will only prove part (a) above, the rest are similar. Write

    d f (x) + g(x) = lim f (x + h) + g(x + h) - (f (x) + g(x))                                                                               x
    dx                                       h                                                             a

                           h0

                    = lim f (x + h) + g(x + h) - f (x) - g(x)                      Figure 3.7: A geometric interpretation of the sum

                                                                                   corresponding points on f (x) and g(x), increasing a

                           h0                h                                     sum of f (a)h and g(a)h. Hence,

The  Derivative  of    x

                     e

We don't know anything about derivatives that allows us to compute the derivatives
of exponential functions without getting our hands dirty. Let's do a little work with
the definition of the derivative:

                          dx           ax+h - ax
                              a = lim
                          dx  h0       h

                              = lim    axah - ax

                              h0       h

                              = lim ax ah - 1
                              h0            h

                              = ax lim ah - 1
                                     h0 h

                              = ax · (constant)

                                       limh0 h ah -1

There are two interesting things to note here: We are left with a limit that involves h

but not x, which means that whatever lim(ah - 1)/h is, we know that it is a number,

                                                                       h0

that is, a constant. This means that ax has a remarkable property: Its derivative is

a constant times itself. Unfortunately it is beyond the scope of this text to compute

the limit

                              lim ah - 1 .
                              h0 h

However, we can look at some examples. Consider (2h - 1)/h and (3h - 1)/h:
60

    h         (2h - 1)/h                h                   (2h - 1)/h  h            (3h - 1)/h  h        (3h - 1)/h
    -1        .5                        1                   1           -1            0.6667     1        2
    -0.1       0.6700                   0.1                  0.7177     -0.1          1.0404     0.1       1.1612
    -0.01      0.6910                   0.01                 0.6956     -0.01         1.0926     0.01      1.1047
    -0.001     0.6929                   0.001                0.6934     -0.001        1.0980     0.001     1.0992
    -0.0001    0.6931                   0.0001               0.6932     -0.0001       1.0986     0.0001    1.0987
    -0.00001   0.6932                   0.00001              0.6932     -0.00001      1.0986     0.00001   1.0986

    While these tables don't prove a pattern, it turns out that

    lim 2h - 1  .7 and lim 3h - 1  1.1.
    h0 h                                h0 h

Moreover, if you do more examples you will find that the limit varies directly with
the value of a: bigger a, bigger limit; smaller a, smaller limit. As we can already
see, some of these limits will be less than 1 and some larger than 1. Somewhere
between a = 2 and a = 3 the limit will be exactly 1. This happens when

              a = e = 2.718281828459045 . . . .

This brings us to our next definition.

Definition Euler's number is defined to be the number e such that
                                         lim eh - 1 = 1.
                                              h0 h

Now we see that the function ex has a truly remarkable property:

    Theorem 3.2.9 (The Derivative of ex)
                                                d ex = ex.
                                                    dx
                                                                                        calculus 61

Proof From the limit definition of the derivative, write

                         dx           ex+h - ex
                             e = lim
                         dx  h0           h

                             = lim    exeh - ex

                             h0           h

                             = lim ex eh - 1
                             h0           h

                             = ex lim eh - 1
                                   h0 h

                             = ex.

    Hence ex is its own derivative. In other words, the slope of the plot of ex is the
same as its height, or the same as its second coordinate: The function f (x) = ex
goes through the point (a, ea ) and has slope ea there, no matter what a is.

Example 3.2.10 Compute:

                             d 8 x + 7ex
                             dx

Solution Write:

                 d 8 x + 7ex = 8 d x1/2 + 7 d ex
                 dx                   dx         dx

                             = 4x-1/2 + 7ex .

4 Curve Sketching

Whether we are interested in a function as a purely mathematical object or in
connection with some application to the real world, it is often useful to know what
the graph of the function looks like. We can obtain a good picture of the graph
using certain crucial information provided by derivatives of the function and certain
limits.

4.1 Extrema

Local extrema on a function are points on the graph where the y coordinate is larger
(or smaller) than all other y coordinates on the graph at points "close to" (x, y).

   Definition
 (a) A point (x, f (x)) is a local maximum if there is an interval a < x < b with

      f (x)  f (z) for every z in (a, b).
 (b) A point (x, f (x)) is a local minimum if there is an interval a < x < b with

      f (x)  f (z) for every z in (a, b).
   A local extremum is either a local maximum or a local minimum.

    Local maximum and minimum points are quite distinctive on the graph of a
function, and are therefore useful in understanding the shape of the graph. In
many applied problems we want to find the largest or smallest value that a function
achieves (for example, we might want to find the minimum cost at which some task
                                                                                                                  calculus 65

can be performed) and so identifying maximum and minimum points will be useful                     y
for applied problems as well.
                                                                                               2       f (x)
   If (x, f (x)) is a point where f (x) reaches a local maximum or minimum, and if the
derivative of f exists at x, then the graph has a tangent line and the tangent line                                                                                         x
must be horizontal. This is important enough to state as a theorem, though we will
not prove it.                                                                            -0.5          0.5    1   1.5     2     2.5                                      3

points at which the derivative is zero, see Figure 4.1, or the derivative is undefined,
as in Figure 4.2. This brings us to our next definition.                                                                            y

   Warning When looking for local maximum and minimum points, you are likely                                                               f (x)

    Since the derivative is zero or undefined at both local maximum and local
minimum points, we need a way to determine which, if either, actually occurs. The
most elementary approach is to test directly whether the y coordinates near the
potential maximum or minimum are above or below the y coordinate at the point of
interest.

    It is not always easy to compute the value of a function at a particular point. The                          y
task is made easier by the availability of calculators and computers, but they have
their own drawbacks--they do not always allow us to distinguish between values                                2               f (x)
that are very close together. Nevertheless, because this method is conceptually                    f (x)
simple and sometimes easy to perform, you should always consider it.

    This is defined everywhere and is zero at x = ± 3/3. Looking first at x = 3/3,       Figure 4.3: A plot of f (x) = x3 and f (x) = 3x2. While
                                                                                         f (0) = 0, there is neither a maximum nor minimum
    we see that                                                                          at (0, f (0)).

                      f ( 3/3) = -2 3/9.

                                               
    Now we test two points on either side of x = 3/3, making sure that neither is
                                                     
    farther away than the nearest critical point; since 3 < 3, 3/3 < 1 and we

    can use x = 0 and x = 1. Since

                                                                                                                   y

    there must be a local minimum at x = 3/3.

    For x = - 3/3, we see that f (- 3/3) = 2 3/9. This time we can use x = 0                                                  f (x)

                                                   
    and x = -1, and we find that f (-1) = f (0) = 0 < 2 3/9, so there must be a
                    
    local maximum at x = - 3/3, see Figure 4.4.

4.2 The First Derivative Test

The method of the previous section for deciding whether there is a local maximum
or minimum at a critical point by testing "near-by" points is not always convenient.
Instead, since we have already had to compute the derivative to find the critical
points, we can use information about the derivative to decide. Recall that
· If f (x) > 0 on an interval, then f (x) is increasing on that interval.
· If f (x) < 0 on an interval, then f (x) is decreasing on that interval.

    So how exactly does the derivative tell us whether there is a maximum, minimum,
or neither at a point? Use the first derivative test.

    Theorem 4.2.1 (First Derivative Test) Suppose that f (x) is continuous on
    an interval, and that f (a) = 0 for some value of a in that interval.
    · If f (x) > 0 to the left of a and f (x) < 0 to the right of a, then f (a) is a

        local maximum.
    · If f (x) < 0 to the left of a and f (x) > 0 to the right of a, then f (a) is a

        local minimum.
    · If f (x) has the same sign to the left and right of f (a), then f (a) is not a

        local extremum.

    Example 4.2.2 Consider the function
                                          f (x) = x + - x 4 x3 2
                                                         43

   Find the intervals on which f (x) is increasing and decreasing and identify the
   local extrema of f (x).
    Solution Start by computing

                                         d f (x) = x3 + x2 - 2x.
                                             dx
                                                                                                           calculus 69

Now we need to find when this function is positive and when it is negative. To

do this, solve

                  f (x) = x3 + x2 - 2x = 0.

Factor f (x)

                  f (x) = x3 + x2 - 2x
                        = x(x2 + x - 2)
                        = x(x + 2)(x - 1).

So the critical points (when f (x) = 0) are when x = -2, x = 0, and x = 1. Now
we can check points between the critical points to find when f (x) is increasing

and decreasing:

f (-3) = -12 f (.5) = -0.625 f (-1) = 2 f (2) = 8                                                            y
                                                                                                           4
From this we can make a sign table:

                                                                                             f (x)         2

 f (x) < 0        f (x) > 0             f (x) < 0      f (x) > 0

              -2                                                                         -3  -2     -1          1                            2  x
Decreasing
                                     0              1

                                        Decreasing

                                                                                                    f (x)  -2

   Hence f (x) is increasing on (-2, 0)  (1, ) and f (x) is decreasing on                                                          -4
   (-, -2)  (0, 1). Moreover, from the first derivative test, Theorem 4.2.1, the         Figure 4.5: A plot of f (x) = x4/4 + x3/3 - x2 and
   local maximum is at x = 0 while the local minima are at x = -2 and x = 1, see         f (x) = x3 + x2 - 2x.
    Figure 4.5.

   Hence we have seen that if f (x) is zero and increasing at a point, then f (x) has a
local minimum at the point. If f (x) is zero and decreasing at a point then f (x) has
a local maximum at the point. Thus, we see that we can gain information about
f (x) by studying how f (x) changes. This leads us to our next section.

4.3 Concavity and Inflection Points

We know that the sign of the derivative tells us whether a function is increasing or

decreasing. Likewise, the sign of the second derivative f (x) tells us whether f (x)

is increasing or decreasing. We summarize this in the table below:

           f (x) < 0                                    f (x) > 0

           Concave Up                                   Concave Up

f (x) > 0

           Here f (x) < 0 and f (x) > 0. This means     Here f (x) > 0 and f (x) > 0. This means
           that f (x) slopes down and is getting less   that f (x) slopes up and is getting steeper.

           Concave Down                                 Concave Down

f (x) < 0

           Here f (x) < 0 and f (x) < 0. This           Here f (x) > 0 and f (x) < 0. This means
           means that f (x) slopes down and is getting  that f (x) slopes up and is getting less
           steeper. In this case the curve is concave   steep. In this case the curve is concave
           down.                                        down.

    If we are trying to understand the shape of the graph of a function, knowing
where it is concave up and concave down helps us to get a more accurate picture. It
is worth summarizing what we have seen already in to a single theorem.
72

    Theorem 4.3.1 (Test for Concavity) Suppose that f (x) exists on an inter-
    val.
  (a) If f (x) > 0 on an interval, then f (x) is concave up on that interval.
  (b) If f (x) < 0 on an interval, then f (x) is concave down on that interval.

    Of particular interest are points at which the concavity changes from up to down
or down to up.

   Definition If f (x) is continuous and its concavity changes either from up to
   down or down to up at x = a, then f (x) has an inflection point at x = a.

    It is instructive to see some examples and nonexamples of inflection points.

This is an inflection point. The concav- This is not an inflection point. The curve This is an inflection point. The concav-  This is not an inflection point. The curve

down.                                                    down.
We identify inflection points by first finding where f (x) is zero or undefined

and then checking to see whether f (x) does in fact go from positive to negative or

negative to positive at these points.

Warning Even if f (a) = 0, the point determined by x = a might not be an
inflection point.

Example 4.3.2 Describe the concavity of f (x) = x3 - x.
                                                                                                           calculus 73

Solution To start, compute the first and second derivative of f (x) with respect                        y

to x,

       f (x) = 3x2 - 1 and f (x) = 6x.

Since f (0) = 0, there is potentially an inflection point at zero. Since f (x) > 0                   2
when x > 0 and f (x) < 0 when x < 0 the concavity does change from down to
up at zero--there is an inflection point at x = 0. The curve is concave down for                           f (x)
all x < 0 and concave up for all x > 0, see Figure 4.6.
                                                                                              f (x)

                                                                                          -1                      1                       x

concavity, so we may as well try to use the second derivative test for maxima and
minima. If for some reason this fails we can then try one of the other tests.       Figure 4.6: A plot of f (x) = x3 - x and f (x) = 6x.

4.4 The Second Derivative Test

Recall the first derivative test, Theorem 4.2.1:

· If f (x) > 0 to the left of a and f (x) < 0 to the right of a, then f (a) is a local
    maximum.

· If f (x) < 0 to the left of a and f (x) > 0 to the right of a, then f (a) is a local
    minimum.

   If f (x) changes from positive to negative it is decreasing. In this case, f (x)
might be negative, and if in fact f (x) is negative then f (x) is definitely decreasing,
so there is a local maximum at the point in question. On the other hand, if f (x)
changes from negative to positive it is increasing. Again, this means that f (x)
might be positive, and if in fact f (x) is positive then f (x) is definitely increasing,
so there is a local minimum at the point in question. We summarize this as the
second derivative test.

    Theorem 4.4.1 (Second Derivative Test) Suppose that f (x) is continu-
    ous on an open interval and that f (a) = 0 for some value of a in that
    interval.

    · If f (a) < 0, then f (x) has a local maximum at a.

    · If f (a) > 0, then f (x) has a local minimum at a.

    · If f (a) = 0, then the test is inconclusive. In this case, f (x) may or may
       not have a local extremum at x = a.

    The second derivative test is often the easiest way to identify local maximum and
minimum points. Sometimes the test fails and sometimes the second derivative is
quite difficult to evaluate. In such cases we must fall back on one of the previous
tests.

    Example 4.4.2 Once again, consider the function
                                          f (x) = x + - x 4 x3 2                                    4

    Use the second derivative test, Theorem 4.4.1, to locate the local extrema of
   f (x).                                                                            -3  -2  -1          1                               2  x

                    f (x) = x3 + x2 - 2x and f (x) = 3x2 + 2x - 2.                                         f (x)
    Using the same technique as used in the solution of Example 4.2.2, we find that
                                                                                                                            -4
                             f (-2) = 0, f (0) = 0, f (1) = 0.                       Figure 4.7: A plot of f (x) = x4/4 + x3/3 - x2 and
    Now we'll attempt to use the second derivative test, Theorem 4.4.1,              f (x) = 3x2 + 2x - 2.

                           f (-2) = 6, f (0) = -2, f (1) = 3.
   Hence we see that f (x) has a local minimum at x = -2, a local maximum at
   x = 0, and a local minimum at x = 1, see Figure 4.7.

   Warning If f (a) = 0, then the second derivative test gives no information on
   whether x = a is a local extremum.

In this section, we will give some general guidelines for sketching the plot of a
function.                                                                           -2  -1         1  2                                3  4  x

    · Find candidates for vertical asymptotes, these are points where f (x) is

     · Use the second derivative test to identify local extrema and/or find the

        intervals where your function is increasing/decreasing.
    · Find the candidates for inflection points, the points where f (x) = 0 or

       f (x) is undefined.
     · Identify inflection points and concavity.
    · If possible find the x-intercepts, the points where f (x) = 0. Place these

        points on your graph.
     · Find horizontal asymptotes.
     · Determine an interval that shows all relevant behavior.
    At this point you should be able to sketch the plot of your function.

   Let's see this procedure in action. We'll sketch the plot of 2x3 - 3x2 - 12x.
Following our guidelines above, we start by computing f (0) = 0. Hence we see that
the y-intercept is (0, 0). Place this point on your plot, see Figure 4.8.
                                                                                                          calculus 79

    Note that there are no vertical asymptotes as our function is defined for all real              y
numbers. Now compute f (x) and f (x),                                                           20

      f (x) = 6x2 - 6x - 12 and f (x) = 12x - 6.

   The critical points are where f (x) = 0, thus we need to solve 6x2 - 6x - 12 = 0             10
for x. Write

                                                                                        -2  -1         1  2  3                              4  x

      6x2 - 6x - 12 = 0                                                                         -10
           x2 - x - 2 = 0

      (x - 2)(x + 1) = 0.

Thus                                                                                                        -20

      f (2) = 0 and f (-1) = 0.                                                         Figure 4.9: Now we add the critical points x = -1
                                                                                        and x = 2.

Mark the critical points x = 2 and x = -1 on your plot, see Figure 4.9.                             y
    Check the second derivative evaluated at the critical points. In this case,                 20

      f (-1) = -18 and f (2) = 18,

hence x = -1, corresponding to the point (-1, 7) is a local maximum and x = 2,                  10
corresponding to the point (2, -20) is local minimum of f (x). Moreover, this tells us
that our function is increasing on [-2, -1), decreasing on (-1, 2), and increasing on   -2  -1         1  2  3                              4  x
(2, 4]. Identify this on your plot, see Figure 4.10.
                                                                                                -10
   The candidates for the inflection points are where f (x) = 0, thus we need to
solve 12x - 6 = 0 for x. Write

      12x - 6 = 0                                                                                           -20
      x - 1/2 = 0
                                                                                        Figure 4.10: We have identified the local extrema
              x = 1/2.                                                                  of f (x) and where this function is increasing and
                                                                                        decreasing.
Thus f (1/2) = 0. Checking points, f (0) = -6 and f (1) = 6. Hence x = 1/2 is an
inflection point, with f (x) concave down to the left of x = 1/2 and f (x) concave up
to the right of x = 1/2. We can add this information to our plot, see Figure 4.11.
80

    Finally, in this case, f (x) = 2x3 - 3x2 - 12x, we can find the x-intercepts. Write

                                         2x3 - 3x2 - 12x = 0
                                         x(2x2 - 3x - 12) = 0.

Using the quadratic formula, we see that the x-intercepts of f (x) are                               y
                                                                                                 20

                       x = 0,          3 - 105       3 + 105                                     10
                                  x= 4 ,        x= 4 .

5 The Product Rule and Quotient Rule

5.1 The Product Rule

Consider the product of two simple functions, say

                                  f (x) · g(x)

where f (x) = x2 + 1 and g(x) = x3 - 3x. An obvious guess for the derivative of
f (x)g(x) is the product of the derivatives:

                      f (x)g(x) = (2x)(3x2 - 3)
                                   = 6x3 - 6x.

Is this guess correct? We can check by rewriting f (x) and g(x) and doing the
calculation in a way that is known to work. Write

                      f (x)g(x) = (x2 + 1)(x3 - 3x)
                                 = x5 - 3x3 + x3 - 3x
                                 = x5 - 2x3 - 3x.

Hence                 d f (x)g(x) = 5x4 - 6x2 - 3,
so we see that        dx

                      d f (x)g(x)  f (x)g(x).
                      dx

So the derivative of f (x)g(x) is not as simple as f (x)g(x). Never fear, we have a

rule for exactly this situation.

Theorem 5.1.1 (The Product Rule) If f (x) and g(x) are differentiable, then              f (x)g(x)

                                                                                                                      f (a)g(a)h + f (a)hg(a) + f (a)hg(a)h

Proof From the limit definition of the derivative, write

    d (f (x)g(x)) = lim f (x + h)g(x + h) - f (x)g(x)                                                                 g(a)h

    dx                    h0          h

                                                                                  g(x )                               f (a)h

Now we use the exact same trick we used in the proof of Theorem 1.2.2, we add                                      h
0 = -f (x + h)g(x) + f (x + h)g(x):

= lim f (x + h)g(x + h)-f (x + h)g(x) + f (x + h)g(x) - f (x)g(x)                                                             x

                                                                                  the corresponding points on f (x) and g(x), increasing
Now since both f (x) and g(x) are differentiable, they are continuous, see Theo-  a by a "small amount" h, increases f (a)g(a) by the
rem 3.1.3. Hence                                                                  sum of f (a)g(a)h and f (a)hg(a). Hence,

Let's return to the example with which we started.

Example 5.1.2 Let f (x) = (x2 + 1) and g(x) = (x3 - 3x). Compute:
                                            d f (x)g(x).
                                                dx

Solution Write
                      d f (x)g(x) = f (x)g(x) + f (x)g(x)
                        dx
                                     = (x2 + 1)(3x2 - 3) + 2x(x3 - 3x).

    We could stop here--but we should show that expanding this out recovers our
    previous result. Write

            (x2 + 1)(3x2 - 3) + 2x(x3 - 3x) = 3x4 - 3x2 + 3x2 - 3 + 2x4 - 6x2
                                                     = 5x4 - 6x2 - 3,

    which is precisely what we obtained before.

5.2 The Quotient Rule

We'd like to have a formula to compute

                                                  d f (x)
                                                  dx g(x)

if we already know f (x) and g(x). Instead of attacking this problem head-on, let's
notice that we've already done part of the problem: f (x)/g(x) = f (x) · (1/g(x)), that
is, this is really a product, and we can compute the derivative if we know f (x) and
(1/g(x)). This brings us to our next derivative rule.

    Theorem 5.2.1 (The Quotient Rule) If f (x) and g(x) are differentiable, then

        d f (x) f (x)g(x) - f (x)g(x)
                 =                    2.
        dx g(x)                  g(x )

Proof First note that if we knew how to compute

                    d1
                    dx g(x)

then we could use the product rule to complete our proof. Write

    d1  = lim    1 g(x+h) - 1 g(x)

    dx g(x) h0       h

                 g(x )-g(x +h )

        = lim g(x+h)g(x)
        h0           h

        = lim g(x) - g(x + h)
          h0 g(x + h)g(x)h

        = lim - g(x + h) - g(x) 1
        h0              h               g(x + h)g(x)

             g (x )
        = - 2.

             g(x )
                                                                                       calculus 87

Now we can put this together with the product rule:

                d f (x)             -g(x)  1
                              = f (x) 2 + f (x)
                dx g(x)             g(x )            g(x )

                                 -f (x)g(x) + f (x)g(x)
                              = g(x)2

                                 f (x)g(x) - f (x)g(x)
                              =            2.
                                    g(x )

Example 5.2.2 Compute:           d x2 + 1
                                 dx x3 - 3x .

Solution Write

                d x2 + 1 2x(x3 - 3x) - (x2 + 1)(3x2 - 3)
                dx x3 - 3x =
                                    (x3 - 3x)2

                              -x4 - 6x2 + 3
                        =                  2.
                                 3(x - 3x)

    It is often possible to calculate derivatives in more than one way, as we have
already seen. Since every quotient can be written as a product, it is always possible
to use the product rule to compute the derivative, though it is not always simpler.

Example 5.2.3 Compute            d 625 - x2
                                 dx x

in two ways. First using the quotient rule and then using the product rule.

Solution First, we'll compute the derivative using the quotient rule. Write

d 625 - x2 (-2x) x - (625 - x2) 12 x-1/2
dx x =                                         x.
88

    Second, we'll compute the derivative using the product rule:

    d 625 - x2 d       2 -1/2
         = 625 - x x
    dx  x  dx

           = 625 - x2  -x- + (-2x) x- 3/2 1/2 .
                          2

    With a bit of algebra, both of these simplify to

                    3x2 + 625
                  - 2x3/2 .

6 The Chain Rule

So far we have seen how to compute the derivative of a function built up from other
functions by addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. There is another
very important way that we combine functions: composition. The chain rule allows
us to deal with this case.

6.1 The Chain Rule                                                                          y
                                                                                                                        f (g(a))g(a)h
Consider

                    h(x) = (1 + 2x)5.

    While there are several different ways to differentiate this function, if we let                                                            g(x )
f (x) = x5 and g(x) = 1 + 2x, then we can express h(x) = f (g(x)). The question is,      a
can we compute the derivative of a composition of functions using the derivatives of
the constituents f (x) and g(x)? To do so, we need the chain rule.

                                                                                            h

Theorem 6.1.1 (Chain Rule) If f (x) and g(x) are differentiable, then                          g(a)h
                                  d f (g(x)) = f (g(x))g(x).

                                                                                      f (g(a)) by f (g(a))g(a)h. Hence,

                                                                                         y  f (g(a))g(a)h = f (g(a))g(a).
Proof Let g0 be some x-value and consider the following:                                 x     h

                    f (g0) = lim f (g0 + h) - f (g0) .

           f (g0) = lim f (g) - f (g0) .                       (6.1)
                     gg0 g - g0

At this point, we might like to set g = g(x + h) and g0 = g(x); however, we cannot
as we cannot be sure that

           g(x + h) - g(x) 0 when h 0.

To overcome this difficulty, let E(g) be the "error term" that gives the difference
between the slope of the secant line from f (g0) to f (g) and f (g0),

                                 E(g) = f (g) - f (g0) - f (g0).
                                              g - g0

In particular, E(g)(g - g0) is the difference between f (g) and the tangent line of
f (x) at x = g, see the figure below:

        y

 f (g)                                        E(g)(g - g0)
f (g0)
                                               f (g0)(g - g0)
                                        g-g0              x

                            g0                g
92

    Hence we see that

           f (g) - f (g0) = f (g0) + E(g) (g - g0),                             (6.2)

and so                 f (g) - f (g0) = f (g0) + E(g).
                          g - g0

    Combining this with Equation 6.1, we have that

                       f (g0) = lim f (g) - f (g0)
                                 gg0 g - g0

                               = lim f (g0) + E(g)

                                      gg0

                               = f (g0) + lim E(g),

                                                     gg0

and hence it follows that lim E(g) = 0. At this point, we may return to the

                                                  gg0

"well-worn path." Starting with Equation 6.2, divide both sides by h and set

g = g(x + h) and g0 = g(x)

        f (g(x + h)) - f (g(x)) = f (g(x)) + E(g(x)) g(x + h) - g(x) .
           h                                                   h

Taking the limit as h approaches 0, we see

    lim f (g(x + h)) - f (g(x))  = lim f (g(x)) + E(g(x))  g(x + h) - g(x)

    h0  h                           h0                            h

                                 = lim f (g(x)) + E(g(x))  lim g(x + h) - g(x)
                                                           h0        h
                                    h0

                                 = f (g(x))g(x).

Hence, d f (g(x)) = f (g(x))g(x).
           dx

    It will take a bit of practice to make the use of the chain rule come naturally--it
is more complicated than the earlier differentiation rules we have seen. Let's return
to our motivating example.
                                                                                        calculus 93

Example 6.1.2 Compute:     d (1 + 2x)5
                           dx

Solution Set f (x) = x5 and g(x) = 1 + 2x, now
                             f (x) = 5x4 and g(x) = 2.

Hence

                   d (1 + 2x)5 = d f (g(x))
                   dx       dx

                            = f (g(x))g(x)

                            = 5(1 + 2x)4 · 2

                            = 10(1 + 2x)4.

Let's see a more complicated chain of compositions.

Example 6.1.3 Compute:

                           d 1 + x
                           dx

Solution Set f (x) = x and g(x) = 1 + x. Hence,

       1 + x = f (g(f (x))) and d f (g(f (x))) = f (g(f (x)))g(f (x))f (x).
                                                     dx

Since                   1

              f (x) =       and g(x) = 1

                        2x

We have that  d             1                        1

                   1+ x =               ·1·  .
              dx 2 1 + x 2 x

    Using the chain rule, the power rule, and the product rule it is possible to avoid
using the quotient rule entirely.

    Example 6.1.4 Compute:      d x3
                                dx x2 + 1

    Solution Rewriting this as

                                d x3(x2 + 1)-1,
                                dx

    set f (x) = x-1 and g(x) = x2 + 1. Now

    x3(x2 + 1)-1 = x3f (g(x)) and d x3f (g(x)) = 3x2f (g(x)) + x3f (g(x))g(x).
                                                        dx

    Since f (x) = x2 -1 and g(x) = 2x, write

    d x3                        3x 2             2x 4
    dx x2 + 1 = x2 + 1 - (x2 + 1)2 .

6.2 Implicit Differentiation

The functions we've been dealing with so far have been explicit functions, meaning

that the dependent variable is written in terms of the independent variable. For

example:                                                         x -2

              y = 3x2 - 2x + 1,   y = e3x ,                y= 2        .
                                                           x - 3x + 2

However, there are another type of functions, called implicit functions. In this case,

the dependent variable is not stated explicitly in terms of the independent variable.

For example:

          x2 + y2 = 4, x3 + y3 = 9xy, x4 + 3x2 = x2/3 + y2/3 = 1.

Your inclination might be simply to solve each of these for y and go merrily on your

way. However this can be difficult and it may require two branches, for example to
                                                                       
explicitly plot x2 + y2 = 4, one needs both y = 4 - x2 and y = - 4 - x2. Moreover,

it may not even be possible to solve for y. To deal with such situations, we use

implicit differentiation. Let's see an illustrative example:                                          y
                                                                                                    6

Applying the sum rule we see                                                            defines a relation between x and y.

                              d x3 + d y3 = d 9xy.

    Let's examine each of these terms in turn. To start

            d x3 = 3x2.
            dx

    On the other hand d y3 is somewhat different. Here you imagine that y = y(x),
                               dx

    and hence by the chain rule

            d y3 = d (y(x))3
        dx                                    dx

            = 3(y(x))2 · y(x)

            = 3y2 dy .
                    dx

    Considering the final term d 9xy, we again imagine that y = y(x). Hence
                                           dx

        d 9xy = 9 d x · y(x)
        dx                                    dx

            = 9 x · y(x) + y(x)

            = 9x dy + 9y.
                   dx

    Putting this all together we are left with the equation

        3x2 + 3y2 dy = 9x dy + 9y.
                dx                                    dx

    At this point, we solve for dy . Write
                                          dx

    3x2 + 3y2 dy = 9x dy + 9y
            dx                                    dx
    3y2 dy - 9x dy = 9y - 3x2
    dx      dx
    dy 3y2 - 9x = 9y - 3x2

       For the second part of the problem, we simply plug x = 4 and y = 2 into the                            y
   formula above, hence the slope of the tangent line at (4, 2) is 5 , see Figure 6.3.                      6

                                                                                             4              4
    You might think that the step in which we solve for dy could sometimes be

to know that the function y has a derivative. All we have shown is that if it

has a derivative then that derivative must be 1/x. The Inverse Function Theorem

guarantees this.

6.3 Logarithmic Differentiation
                                                                                                  1  2  3  4                              6  7  x
Logarithms were originally developed as a computational tool. The key fact that
made this possible is that:                                                                                   5

                                    logb(xy) = logb(x) + logb(y).                         -2

    While this may seem quite abstract, before the days of calculators and computers,        -4
this was critical knowledge for anyone in a computational discipline. Suppose you         Figure 6.5: A plot of ln(x). Here we see that
wanted to compute
                                                                                                             ln(2 · 3) = ln(2) + ln(3).
                                                138 · 23.4
You would start by writing both in scientific notation

                                       1.38 · 102 · 2.34 · 101 .
Next you would use a log-table, which gives log10(N ) for values of N ranging between
0 and 9. We've reproduced part of such a table below.

    From the table, we see that

                   log10(1.38)  0.1399 and log10(2.34)  0.3692

Add these numbers together to get 0.5091. Essentially, we know the following at
this point:

                           log10(?) = log10(1.38) + log10(2.34)


                    
                                          

0.5091 = 0.1399 + 0.3692
   Using the table again, we see that log10(3.23)  0.5091. Since we were working                                          calculus 103
in scientific notation, we need to multiply this by 103. Our final answer is
                                                                                     Recall the properties of logarithms:
                            3230  138 · 23.4                                         · logb(xy) = logb(x) + logb(y)
                                                                                     · logb(x/y) = logb(x) - logb(y)
Since 138 · 23.4 = 3229.2, this is a good approximation. The moral is:               · logb(xy) = y logb(x)

Logarithms allow us to use addition in place of multiplication.

    When taking derivatives, both the product rule and the quotient rule can be
cumbersome to use. Logarithms will save the day. A key point is the following

                        d ln(f (x)) = 1 · f (x) = f (x)
                        dx  f (x)             f (x)

which follows from the chain rule. Let's look at an illustrative example to see how
this is actually used.

Example 6.3.1 Compute:      d x 9e4x
                            dx x2 + 4

Solution While we could use the product and quotient rule to solve this prob-
lem, it would be tedious. Start by taking the logarithm of the function to be
differentiated.

                  x 9e4x                
ln                          = ln x9e4x - ln x2 + 4
                  x2 + 4

                            = ln x9 + ln e4x - ln (x2 + 4)1/2

                            = 9 ln(x) + 4x - 1 ln(x2 + 4).
                                                   2

x 9e4x                  , we can write
Setting f (x) = 
                x2 + 4

                  ln(f (x)) = 9 ln(x) + 4x - 1 ln(x2 + 4).
                                                     2
104

Differentiating both sides, we find

                        f (x) 9               x
                                   = +4- 2 .
                        f (x) x               x +4

Finally we solve for f (x), write

     f (x) = 9x + 4 - x2x+ 4                       x 9e4x     .
                                                   
                                                     x2 + 4

The process above is called logarithmic differentiation. Logarithmic differentiation

allows us to compute new derivatives too.

Example 6.3.2 Compute:               d xx
                                     dx

Solution The function xx is tricky to differentiate. We cannot use the power
rule, as the exponent is not a constant. However, if we set f (x) = xx we can
write

                        ln(f (x)) = ln (xx )
                                  = x ln(x).

Differentiating both sides, we find

                        f (x) = x · 1 + ln(x)
                        f (x)              x

                                     = 1 + ln(x).

Now we can solve for f (x),
                                      f (x) = xx + xx ln(x).

    Finally recall that previously we only proved the power rule, Theorem 3.2.2, for
positive exponents. Now we'll use logarithmic differentiation to give a proof for all
real-valued exponents. We restate the power rule for convenience sake:
                                                                                          calculus 105

   Theorem 6.3.3 (Power Rule) For any real number n,
                                              d xn = nxn-1.
                                                  dx

   Proof We will use logarithmic differentiation. Set f (x) = xn. Write
                                           ln(f (x)) = ln (xn)
                                                     = n ln(x).

   Now differentiate both sides, and solve for f (x)
                                             f (x) n
                                                    =
                                             f (x) x
                                             f (x) = nf (x)
                                                                x
                                                    = nxn-1.

   Thus we see that the power rule holds for all real-valued exponents.

    While logarithmic differentiation might seem strange and new at first, with a little
practice it will seem much more natural to you.

7.1 The Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions

Up until this point of the course we have been largely ignoring a large class of
functions--those involving sin(x) and cos(x). It is now time to visit our two friends

Consider the following geometric interpretation of the derivative of sin().

                                      h h cos()
                                            

                                    sin()

             h

               
                                                                                      x

                         cos()

Here we see that increasing  by a "small amount" h, increases sin() by approxi-

mately h cos(). Hence,

                               y  h cos() = cos().
                                 h

With this said, the derivative of a function measures the slope of the plot of a

function. If we examine the graphs of the sine and cosine side by side, it should be

that the latter appears to accurately describe the slope of the former, and indeed

this is true, see Figure 7.1.

Of course, now that we know the derivative of the sine, we can compute derivatives

of more complicated functions involving the sine.

Theorem 7.1.2 (The Derivative of cos(x))                                        Figure 7.1: Here we see a plot of f (x) = sin(x) and
                                       d cos(x) = - sin(x).                     its derivative f (x) = cos(x). One can readily see that
                                           dx                                   cos(x) is positive when sin(x) is increasing, and that
                                                                                cos(x) is negative when sin(x) is decreasing.

Proof Recall that     cos(x) = sin x +  ,
Now:                                          2

                      sin(x) = - cos x +  .
                                                 2

                      d cos(x) = d sin x + 
                   dx  dx                                    2

                       = cos x +  · 1
                                      2

                       = - sin(x).

Next we have:

Theorem 7.1.3 (The Derivative of tan(x))
                                        d tan(x) = sec2(x).
                                           dx
110

Proof We'll rewrite tan(x) as sin(x) and use the quotient rule. Write
                                       cos(x )

         d tan(x) = d sin(x)
     dx  dx cos(x)

            cos2(x) + sin2(x)
         cos ( = 2 x)

                1
         cos ( = 2 x)

         = sec2(x).

Finally, we have

Theorem 7.1.4 (The Derivative of sec(x))
                                    d sec(x) = sec(x) tan(x).
                                       dx

Proof We'll rewrite sec(x) as (cos(x))-1 and use the power rule and the chain
rule. Write

     d sec(x) = d (cos(x))-1
     dx  dx

         = -1(cos(x))-2(- sin(x))

             sin(x )
         cos ( = 2 x)

         = sec(x) tan(x).

The derivatives of the cotangent and cosecant are similar and left as exercises.
Putting this all together, we have:

Warning When working with derivatives of trigonometric functions, we suggest
you use radians for angle measure. For example, while

                  sin ((90)2) = sin  , 2
                                             2

one must be careful with derivatives as

              d sin x2                   2 · 90 · cos(902)
              dx
                        x =90                     incorrect

Alternatively, one could think of x as meaning x ·  , as then 90 = 90 ·  =  .

7.2 Inverse Trigonometric Functions

The trigonometric functions frequently arise in problems, and often we are interested
in finding specific angles, say  such that

                                                sin() = .7

Hence we want to be able to invert functions like sin() and cos().
    However, since these functions are not one-to-one, meaning there are are infinitely

many angles with sin() = .7, it is impossible to find a true inverse function for sin().
Nevertheless, it is useful to have something like an inverse to the sine, however
imperfect. The usual approach is to pick out some collection of angles that produce
all possible values of the sine exactly once. If we "discard" all other angles, the
resulting function has a proper inverse.

                                  y

             1
                                            sin()

                           -1

In a similar fashion, we need to restrict cosine to be able to take an inverse.                Figure 7.2: The function sin() takes on all val-
                                                                      y                        ues between -1 and 1 exactly once on the interval
                                                                                               [-/2, /2]. If we restrict sin() to this interval, then
                                                                                               this restricted function has an inverse.

                                                                                               we restrict cos() to this interval, then this restricted
                                                                                               function has an inverse.

By examining both sine and cosine on restricted domains, we can now produce

functions arcsine and arccosine:

                                                                            

         /2 

                                  y                                     /2

     -1    1

             -/2                                                                         y

Here we see a plot of arcsin(y), the inverse                        -1                1
function of sin() when it is restricted to
the interval [-/2, /2].                                   Here we see a plot of arccos(y), the inverse

                                                          function of cos() when it is restricted to

                                                          the interval [0, ].

Recall that a function and its inverse undo each other in either order, for example,

           3 x3 = x and                       3 x 3 = x.                              Compare this with the fact that while  x 2 = x, we
                                                                                                   

                                                                                      have that x2 = |x|.

However, since arcsine is the inverse of sine restricted to the interval [-/2, /2],
this does not work with sine and arcsine, for example

              arcsin(sin()) = 0.

Moreover, there is a similar situation for cosine and arccosine as

              arccos(cos(2)) = 0.

Once you get a feel for how arcsin(y) and arccos(y) behave, let's examine tangent.

The Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

What is the derivative of the arcsine? Since this is an inverse function, we can find
its derivative by using implicit differentiation and the Inverse Function Theorem,
Theorem 6.2.3.

Theorem 7.2.1 (The Derivative of arcsin(y))

       d arcsin(y) =       1.
       dy                 1 - y2

Proof To start, note that the Inverse Function Theorem, Theorem 6.2.3 assures
us that this derivative actually exists. Recall

       arcsin(y) =   sin() = y.

Hence

           sin() = y

       d sin() = d y
       dy             dy

       cos() d = 1
                dy

           d = 1 .
           dy cos()

At this point, we would like cos() written in terms of y. Since

       cos2() + sin2() = 1

and sin() = y, we may write

                                   cos2() + y2 = 1
                                         cos2() = 1 - y2
                                          cos() = ± 1 - y2.
                                                                               calculus 117

Since  = arcsin(y) we know that -/2    /2, and the cosine of an angle in
this interval is always positive. Thus cos() = 1 - y2 and

       d arcsin(y) =   1.
       dy             1 - y2

We can do something similar with arccosine.

Theorem 7.2.2 (The Derivative of arccos(y))

       d arccos(y) =  -1 .
       dy             1 - y2

Proof To start, note that the Inverse Function Theorem, Theorem 6.2.3 assures
us that this derivative actually exists. Recall

       arccos(y) =   cos() = y.

Hence

           cos() = y

       d cos() = d y
       dy             dy

       - sin() d = 1
                  dy

           d = -1 .
           dy sin()

At this point, we would like sin() written in terms of y. Since

       cos2() + sin2() = 1
118

and cos() = y, we may write

                                   y2 + sin2() = 1
                                         sin2() = 1 - y2
                                          sin() = ± 1 - y2.

Since  = arccos(y) we know that 0    , and the sine of an angle in this
interval is always positive. Thus sin() = 1 - y2 and

       d arccos(y) =                           -1 .
       dy                                      1 - y2

Finally, let's look at arctangent.

Theorem 7.2.3 (The Derivative of arctan(y))

       d arctan(y) =                           1
                                                  2.
       dy                                      1+y

Proof To start, note that the Inverse Function Theorem, Theorem 6.2.3 assures
us that this derivative actually exists. Recall

       arctan(y) =   tan() = y.

Hence

                                    tan() = y

       d tan() = d y
       dy                                dy

       sec2() d = 1
                 dy

                                    d =        1
                                               2.
                                    dy sec ()
                                                                                           calculus 119

At this point, we would like sec2() written in terms of y. Recall

                                sec2() = 1 + tan2()

and tan() = y, we may write sec2() = 1 + y2. Hence

                                d arctan(y) =  1
                                                  2.
                                dy             1+y

    We leave it to you, the reader, to investigate the derivatives of arcsecant, arccose-
cant, and arccotangent. However, as a gesture of friendship, we now present you
with a list of derivative formulas for inverse trigonometric functions.

8.1 L'Hôpital's Rule

Derivatives allow us to take problems that were once difficult to solve and convert
them to problems that are easier to solve. Let us consider l'Hôpital's rule:

Theorem 8.1.1 (L'Hôpital's Rule) Let f (x) and g(x) be functions that are
differentiable near a. If

                      lim f (x) = lim g(x) = 0  or ± ,                                L'Hôpital's rule applies even when lim f (x) = ±
                      x a         x a
                                                                                                                                                      x a
f (x)
                                                                                      and lim g(x) = . See Example 8.1.4.

                                                                                             x a

and lim  exists, and g (x)        0 for all x near a, then

xa g (x)

                                  f (x)  f (x)
                             lim         = lim  .
                             xa g(x) xa g (x)

This theorem is somewhat difficult to prove, in part because it incorporates so many
different possibilities, so we will not prove it here.
122

L'Hôpital's rule allows us to investigate limits of indeterminate form.

Definition (List of Indeterminate Forms)

0/0 This refers to a limit of the form lim f (x) where f (x)  0 and g(x)  0 as
               xa g(x)
     x  a.

/ This refers to a limit of the form lim f (x) where f (x)   and g(x)  
               xa g(x)
     as x  a.

0 · This refers to a limit of the form lim (f (x) · g(x)) where f (x)  0 and
   g(x)   as x  a. xa

- This refers to a limit of the form lim (f (x) - g(x)) where f (x)   and
   g(x)   as x  a. xa

1 This refers to a limit of the form lim f (x)g(x) where f (x)  1 and g(x)  
   as x  a. xa

00 This refers to a limit of the form lim f (x)g(x) where f (x)  0 and g(x)  0
   as x  a. xa

0 This refers to a limit of the form lim f (x)g(x) where f (x)   and g(x)  0
   as x  a. xa

In each of these cases, the value of the limit is not immediately obvious. Hence,
a careful analysis is required!

    Our first example is the computation of a limit that was somewhat difficult before,
see Example 1.3.6. Note, this is an example of the indeterminate form 0/0.

    Example 8.1.2 (0/0) Compute
                                                lim sin(x) .
                                                     x0 x
                                                                                               calculus 123

Solution Set f (x) = sin(x) and g(x) = x. Since both f (x) and g(x) are differen-                y
tiable functions at 0, and
                                                                                               1
                                lim f (x) = lim g(x) = 0,                                                           f (x)
                                x 0  x 0
                                                                                                                                        x
this situation is ripe for l'Hôpital's Rule. Now                                                                                   /2

f (x) = cos(x) and g(x) = 1.

L'Hôpital's rule tells us that                                                            -/2

lim sin(x) = lim cos(x) = 1.
x0 x                                 x0 1

    From this example, we gain an intuitive feeling for why l'Hôpital's rule is true: If                                 -1
two functions are both 0 when x = a, and if their tangent lines have the same slope,                   g(x )
then the functions coincide as x approaches a. See Figure 8.1.
                                                                                          Figure 8.1: A plot of f (x) = sin(x) and g(x) = x. Note
    Our next set of examples will run through the remaining indeterminate forms           how the tangent lines for each curve are coincident
one is likely to encounter.                                                               at x = 0.

   Example 8.1.3 (/) Compute

                                                lim sec(x) .
                                              x/2+ tan(x)

Solution Set f (x) = sec(x) and g(x) = tan(x). Both f (x) and g(x) are differen-
tiable near /2. Additionally,

lim f (x) = lim g(x) = -.
x /2+                                x /2+

This situation is ripe for l'Hôpital's Rule. Now

f (x) = sec(x) tan(x) and g(x) = sec2(x).

L'Hôpital's rule tells us that

lim sec(x) = lim 2 sec(x) tan(x) = lim sin(x) = 1.
x/2+ tan(x) x/2+ sec (x)                          x /2+
124

Example 8.1.4 (0 ·) Compute

                             lim x ln x.

                             x 0+

Solution This doesn't appear to be suitable for l'Hôpital's Rule. As x ap-
proaches zero, ln x goes to -, so the product looks like

     (something very small) · (something very large and negative).

This product could be anything--a careful analysis is required. Write

                     ln x
           x ln x = -1 .

                       x

Set f (x) = ln(x) and g(x) = x-1. Since both functions are differentiable near zero

and

           lim ln(x) = - and lim x-1 = ,
     x 0+                                     x 0+

we may apply l'Hôpital's rule. Write

           f (x) = x-1 and g(x) = -x-2,

so x x-1
                           ln                 -2 = lim -x = 0.
     lim x ln x = lim -1 = lim
     x 0+  x0+ x                      x0+ -x        x 0+

One way to interpret this is that since lim+ x ln x = 0, the function x approaches

                                                                      x 0

zero much faster than ln x approaches -.

Indeterminate Forms Involving Subtraction
There are two basic cases here, we'll do an example of each.

   Example 8.1.5 (-) Compute
                                          lim (cot(x) - csc(x)) .

                                                           x 0
                                                                                      calculus 125

Solution Here we simply need to write each term as a fraction,

               lim (cot(x) - csc(x)) = lim cos(x) - 1
               x 0                     x0 sin(x) sin(x)

                                       = lim cos(x) - 1
                                         x0 sin(x)

Setting f (x) = cos(x) - 1 and g(x) = sin(x), both functions are differentiable near

zero and

                    lim(cos(x) - 1) = lim sin(x) = 0.
                    x 0                x 0

We may now apply l'Hôpital's rule. Write

               f (x) = - sin(x) and g(x) = cos(x),

so cos(x) - 1 - sin(x)                                                = 0.
          lim (cot(x) - csc(x)) = lim          = lim
          x 0            x0 sin(x)                         x0 cos(x)

Sometimes one must be slightly more clever.

Example 8.1.6 (-) Compute
                                              

                                       lim x2 + x - x .

                                                       x 

Solution Again, this doesn't appear to be suitable for l'Hôpital's Rule. A bit of
algebraic manipulation will help. Write

                    
               lim x2 + x - x = lim x 1 + 1/x - 1
               x                       x 

                         = lim              1 + 1/x - 1

                                       x    x              -1

Now set f (x) = 1 + 1/x - 1, g(x) = x-1. Since both functions are differentiable
for large values of x and

                    lim ( 1 + 1/x - 1) = lim x-1 = 0,
                    x                      x 
126

we may apply l'Hôpital's rule. Write
             f (x) = (1/2)(1 + 1/x)-1/2 · (-x-2) and g(x) = -x-2

so

         2                          1 + 1/x - 1

     lim x + x - x = lim               x  -1
     x                     x 

                           = lim  (1/2)(1 + 1/x)-1/2 · (-x-2)

                           x                                          -x  -2

                           = lim       1

                           x 2 1 + 1/x

                           = 1.

Exponential Indeterminate Forms
There is a standard trick for dealing with the indeterminate forms

                                          1, 00, 0.

Given u(x) and v(x) such that
                                               lim u(x)v(x)

                                                                   x a

falls into one of the categories described above, rewrite as

                                              lim ev(x) ln(u(x))

                                                                 x a

and then examine the limit of the exponent

            lim v(x) ln(u(x)) = lim                                   ln(u (x ))

            x a                     xa v(x)                           -1

using l'Hôpital's rule. Since these forms are all very similar, we will only give a
single example.

Example 8.1.7 (1) Compute

                           lim 1 + 1 x .
                           x        x
                                                                                          calculus 127

Solution Write                     lim 1 + 1 x = lim ex ln(1+ x1 ).

                                   x       x       x 

So now look at the limit of the exponent

                                              1        ln 1 + 1x
                lim x ln 1 + = lim -1 .
                x                             x x x

Setting f (x) = ln 1 + 1           and g(x) = x-1, both functions are differentiable for
                                x

large values of x and

                                   lim ln 1 + 1 = lim x-1 = 0.
                                   x          x x

We may now apply l'Hôpital's rule. Write

                f (x) = -x-2                     and g(x) = -x-2,
                          1 + 1x

so

                                   lim  ln 1 + 1x               -x -2

                                   x x     -1      = lim 1+ x1
                                                     x -x -2
                                                               1

                                                   = lim 1
                                                     x 1 +

                                                                         x

                                                   = 1.

Hence,          lim 1 + 1 x = lim ex ln(1+ x1 ) = e1 = e.

8.2 The Derivative as a Rate                                                              600 d

The world is constantly changing around us. To simplify matters we will only              500
consider change in one dimension. This means that if we think of a ball being
tossed in the air, we will consider its vertical movement separately from its lateral     400
and forward movement. To understand how things change, we need to understand
the rate of change. Let's start out with some rather basic ideas.                         300

Definition Given a function f (x), the average rate of change over the interval           200

[a, a + x] is given by                                                                    100

                             f (a + x) - f (a) .                                                                                                                                    t
                                     x                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
                                                                                         Figure 8.2: Here we see a plot of the distance traveled
Example 8.2.1 Suppose you drive a car on a 600 mile road trip. Your distance             on a 600 mile road trip.
from home is recorded by the plot shown in Figure 8.2. What was your average
velocity during hours 4-8 of your trip?

Solution Examining Figure 8.2, we see that we were around 240 miles from

home at hour 4, and 360 miles from home at hour 8. Hence our average velocity

was         360 - 240 = 120 = 30 miles per hour.

                        8-4  4

    Of course if you look at Figure 8.2 closely, you see that sometimes we were driving
faster and other times we were driving slower. To get more information, we need to
know the instantaneous rate of change.

Definition  Given a function, the instantaneous rate of change at x = a is
given by
                             d f (x) .
                             dx
                                 x =a

Example 8.2.2 Again suppose, you drive a car 600 mile road trip. Your
                                                                                                            calculus 131

    distance from home is recorded by the plot shown in Figure 8.2. What was               p
    your instantaneous velocity 8 hours into your trip?                                30

    Solution Since the instantaneous rate of change is measured by the derivative,     20
    we need to find the slope of the tangent line to the curve. At 7 hours, the curve
    is growing at an essentially constant rate. In fact, the growth rate seems to be   10
   constant from (7, 300) to (10, 500). This gives us an instantaneous growth rate
   at hour 8 of about 200/3  67 miles per hour.

Physical Applications

In physical applications, we are often concerned about position, velocity, speed,
acceleration.

                     p(t) = position with respect to time.
                     v(t) = p(t) = velocity with respect to time.
                     s(t) = |v(t)| = speed, the absolute value of velocity.
                     a(t) = v(t) = acceleration with respect to time.

    Let's see an example.

    Example 8.2.3 The Mostar bridge in Bosnia is 25 meters above the river
    Neretva. For fun, you decided to dive off the bridge. Your position t seconds
    after jumping off is

                                          p(t) = -4.9t2 + 25.
    When do you hit the water? What is your instantaneous velocity as you enter
    the water? What is your average velocity during your dive?

    Solution To find when you hit the water, you must solve

                                            -4.9t2 + 25 = 0

                                                                                                    0.5  1  1.5  2  2.5                       3  t

                                                                                       Figure 8.3: Here we see a plot of p(t) = -4.9t2 + 25.

                                                                                       Note, time is on the t-axis and vertical height is on

                                                                                       the p-axis.
132

Write

                                         -4.9t2 = -25
                                                t2  5.1
                                                 t  2.26.

Hence after approximately 2.26 seconds, you gracefully enter the river.
   Your instantaneous velocity is given by p(t). Write

                                          p(t) = -9.8t,

so your instantaneous velocity when you enter the water is approximately

In biological applications, we are often concerned with how animals and plants grow,  0.8

    Example 8.2.4 A certain bacterium divides into two cells every 20 minutes.
    The initial population of a culture is 120 cells. Find a formula for the pop-     0.4
    ulation. What is the average growth rate during the first 4 hours? What is
    the instantaneous growth rate of the population at 4 hours? What rate is the
    population growing at 20 hours?

Solution Since we start with 120 cells, and this population doubles every 20

minutes, then the population doubles three times an hour. So the formula for the      0.2

population is

                     p(t) = 120 · 23t                                                                                                          t

where t is time measured in hours.                                                             1  2  3  4                                   5

                                                                                      Note, time is on the t-axis and population is on the

                                                                                      p-axis.

Now, the average growth rate during the first 4 hours is given by

p(4) - p(0) = 491520 - 120 = 122850 cells per hour.

We compute the instantaneous growth rate of the population with

   p(t) = ln(2) · 360 · 23t .

So p(4)  1022087 cells per hour. Note how fast p(t) is growing, this is why it
is important to stop bacterial infections fast!

8.3 Related Rates Problems

Suppose we have two variables x and y which are both changing with respect to

time. A related rates problem is a problem where we know one rate at a given

instant, and wish to find the other. If y is written in terms of x, and we are given
dx , then it is easy to find dy using the chain rule:
dt   dt

                            dy = y(x(t)) · x(t).
                            dt

In many cases, particularly the interesting ones, our functions will be related in
some other way. Nevertheless, in each case we'll use the same strategy:

    Guidelines for Related Rates Problems

    Draw a picture. If possible, draw a schematic picture with all the relevant
        information.

    Find an equation. We want an equation that relates all relevant functions.

    Differentiate the equation. Here we will often use implicit differentiation.

    Evaluate the equation at the desired values. The known values should
        let you solve for the relevant rate.

Let's see a concrete example.

    Example 8.3.1 A plane is flying directly away from you at 500 mph at an
    altitude of 3 miles. How fast is the plane's distance from you increasing at the
    moment when the plane is flying over a point on the ground 4 miles from you?

    Solution We'll use our general strategy to solve this problem. To start, draw a
    picture.
                                                                                  calculus 137

      p(t) = 500 mph p(t) 

      s(t) miles      3 miles

      4 miles

Next we need to find an equation. By the Pythagorean Theorem we know

that

                      p2 + 32 = s2.

Now we differentiate the equation. Write

                      2p(t)p(t) = 2s(t)s(t).

Now we'll evaluate the equation at the desired values. We are interested
in the time at which p(t) = 4 and p(t) = 500. Additionally, at this time we know
that 42 + 9 = s2, so s(t) = 5. Putting together all the information we get

                      2(4)(500) = 2(5)s(t),

thus s(t) = 400 mph.

Example 8.3.2 You are inflating a spherical balloon at the rate of 7 cm3/sec.
How fast is its radius increasing when the radius is 4 cm?

Solution To start, draw a picture.
138

     dV = 7 cm3/sec
     dt

                     r = 4 cm

                     V = 4r3 cm3
                              3

    Next we need to find an equation. Thinking of the variables r and V as
functions of time, they are related by the equation

                              4 (r (t ))3
                     V (t) = 3 .

     Now we need to differentiate the equation. Taking the derivative of both

sides gives          dV = 4(r(t))2 · r(t).
                     dt

Finally we evaluate the equation at the desired values. Set r(t) = 4 cm and
dV = 7 cm3/sec. Write
 dt

                        7 = 442r(t),
                     r(t) = 7/(64) cm/sec.

Example 8.3.3 Water is poured into a conical container at the rate of 10
cm3/sec. The cone points directly down, and it has a height of 30 cm and a
base radius of 10 cm. How fast is the water level rising when the water is 4 cm
deep?

Solution To start, draw a picture.
                                                                                calculus 139

                     dV = 10 cm3/sec
                     dt

                              10 cm

30 cm                r cm

                                  h(t) = 4 cm

Note, no attempt was made to draw this picture to scale, rather we want all

of the relevant information to be available to the mathematician.

Now we need to find an equation. The formula for the volume of a cone

tells us that  V =  r2h.
                     3

Now we must differentiate the equation. We should use implicit differenti-

ation, and treat each of the variables as functions of t. Write

               dV =  2rh dr + r2 dh .                              (8.1)
               dt 3  dt       dt

    At this point we evaluate the equation at the desired values. At first
something seems to be wrong, we do not know dr . However, the dimensions

                                                                      dt
of the cone of water must have the same proportions as those of the container.
That is, because of similar triangles,

                                  r = 10 so r = h/3.
                                      h 30
In particular, we see that when h = 4, r = 4/3 and

               dr = 1 · dh .
               dt 3 dt
140

Now we can evaluate the equation at the desired values. Starting with
Equation 8.1, we plug in dV = 10, r = 4/3, dr = 1 · dh and h = 4. Write
                       dt  dt 3 dt

       10 =  2 · 4 · 4 · 1 · dh +  4 2 dh
               3 3 3 dt            3 dt

       10 =  32 dh + 16 dh
               3 9 dt 9 dt

       10 = 16 dh
                 9 dt

     90 = dh .
     16 dt

Thus, dh = 90 cm/sec.
         dt 16

Example 8.3.4 A swing consists of a board at the end of a 10 ft long rope.
Think of the board as a point P at the end of the rope, and let Q be the point of
attachment at the other end. Suppose that the swing is directly below Q at
time t = 0, and is being pushed by someone who walks at 6 ft/sec from left to
right. What is the angular speed of the rope in deg/sec after 1 sec?

Solution To start, draw a picture.
                             Q

     
                10 ft

     dx = 6 ft/sec
     dt P
                                                                                           calculus 141

        Now we must find an equation. From the right triangle in our picture, we
    see

                                              sin() = x/10.

    We can now differentiate the equation. Taking derivatives we obtain

                                        cos() · (t) = 0.1x(t).

   Now we can evaluate the equation at the desired values. When t = 1 sec,
    the person was pushed by someone who walks 6 ft/sec. Hence we have a
   6 - 8 - 10 right triangle, with x(t) = 6, and cos  = 8/10. Thus

                                          (8/10)(t) = 6/10,

   and so (t) = 6/8 = 3/4 rad/sec, or approximately 43 deg/sec.
    We have seen that sometimes there are apparently more than two variables that
change with time, but as long as you know the rates of change of all but one of them
you can find the rate of change of the remaining one. As in the case when there are
just two variables, take the derivative of both sides of the equation relating all of the
variables, and then substitute all of the known values and solve for the unknown
rate.

    Example 8.3.5 A road running north to south crosses a road going east to
    west at the point P. Cyclist A is riding north along the first road, and cyclist
    B is riding east along the second road. At a particular time, cyclist A is 3
    kilometers to the north of P and traveling at 20 km/hr, while cyclist B is 4
    kilometers to the east of P and traveling at 15 km/hr. How fast is the distance
    between the two cyclists changing?

    Solution We start the same way we always do, we draw a picture.
142

     a(t) = 20 km/hr

                                          c(t)
                         3 km

     P

        4 km                                    b(t) = 15 km/hr

   Here a(t) is the distance of cyclist A north of P at time t, and b(t) the distance
of cyclist B east of P at time t, and c(t) is the distance from cyclist A to cyclist B
at time t.

    We must find an equation. By the Pythagorean Theorem,

                                      c(t)2 = a(t)2 + b(t)2.

Now we can differentiate the equation. Taking derivatives we get

                             2c(t)c(t) = 2a(t)a(t) + 2b(t)b(t).

Now we can evaluate the equation at the desired values. We know that
a(t) = 3, a(t) = 20, b(t) = 4 and b(t) = 15. Hence by the Pythagorean Theorem,
c(t) = 5. So

                              2 · 5 · c(t) = 2 · 3 · 20 + 2 · 4 · 15
solving for c(t) we find c(t) = 24 km/hr.

techniques of calculus to find the maximum or the minimum value required.

9.1 Maximum and Minimum Values of Curves

We already know how to find local extrema. We wish to find absolute extrema.

   Definition
 (a) A point (x, f (x)) is an absolute maximum on an interval if f (x)  f (z) for

       every z in that interval.
 (b) A point (x, f (x)) is an absolute minimum on an interval if f (x)  f (z) for

       every z in that interval.
   An absolute extremum is either an absolute maximum or an absolute mini-
   mum.

    If we are working on an finite closed interval, then we have the following theorem.
                                                                                                         calculus 147

Theorem 9.1.1 (Extreme Value Theorem) If f (x) is a continuous function                    y
for all x in the closed interval [a, b], then there are points c and d in [a, b],    f (c)
such that (c, f (c)) is an absolute maximum and (d, f (d)) is an absolute
minimum on [a, b].

In Figure 9.1, we see a geometric interpretation of this theorem.

Example 9.1.2 Find the (absolute) maximum and minimum values of f (x) =
x2 on the interval [-2, 1].

Solution To start, write  d x2 = 2x.                                                 f (d)
                          dx
                                                                                                  a  c        d                                     x

The critical point is at x = 0. By the Extreme Value Theorem, Theorem 9.1.1, we                                                            b

f (-2) = 4, f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1.                                                    both an absolute maximum and an absolute mini-
                                                                                     mum on an interval [a, b]. Note, it may be the case
                                                                                     that a = c, b = d, or that d < c.

So on the interval [-2, 1], the absolute maximum of f (x) is 4 at x = -2 and the                           y
absolute minimum is 0 at x = 0, see Figure 9.2.                                                          6

    It is possible that there is no global maximum or minimum. It is difficult, and                      4
not particularly useful, to express a complete procedure for determining whether
this is the case. Generally, the best approach is to gain enough understanding of                        2

    Example 9.1.3 Find the (absolute) maximum and minimum values of the
   function f (x) = |x - 2| on the interval [1, 4].

Solution To start, rewrite f (x) as                                                                                                              x

   The derivative f (x) is never zero, but f (x) is undefined at x = 2, so we have a
   critical point at x = 2. Compute f (2) = 0. Checking the endpoints we get f (1) = 1     2
   and f (4) = 2. The smallest of these numbers is f (2) = 0, which is, therefore,
   the minimum value of f (x) on the interval and the maximum is f (4) = 2, see            1

                                                                                                1  2                         3  4                    x
   Warning The Extreme Value Theorem, Theorem 9.1.1, requires that the func-
   tion in question be continuous on a closed interval. For example consider                                                                      5
   f (x) = tan(x) on (-/2, /2). In this case, the function is continuous on
   (-/2, /2), but the interval is not closed. Hence, the Extreme Value Theorem             -1
   does not apply, see Figure 9.4.                                                         Figure 9.3: A plot of the function f (x) = |x - 2| on
                                                                                           the interval [1, 4].
    Finally, if there are several critical points in the interval, then the mathematician
might want to use the second derivative test, Theorem 4.4.1, to identify if the critical                                           y
points are local maxima or minima, rather than simply evaluating the function at                                              10

9.2 Basic Optimization Problems
                                                                                                               x cm
In this section, we will present several worked examples of optimization problems.   Figure 9.5: A rectangle with an area of 100 cm2.
Our method for solving these problems is essentially the following:

    Guidelines for Optimization
    Draw a picture. If possible, draw a schematic picture with all the relevant

        information.
    Determine your goal. We need identify what needs to be optimized.
    Find constraints. What limitations are set on our optimization?
    Solve for a single variable. Now you should have a function to optimize.
    Use calculus to find the extreme values. Be sure to check your answer!

    Example 9.2.1 Of all rectangles of area 100 cm2, which has the smallest
    perimeter?

    Solution First we draw a picture, see Figure 9.5. If x denotes one of the sides
    of the rectangle, then the adjacent side must be 100/x.

        The perimeter of this rectangle is given by
                                           p(x) = 2x + 2 100 .
                                                                     x

   We wish to minimize p(x). Note, not all values of x make sense in this problem:
    lengths of sides of rectangles must be positive, so x > 0. If x > 0 then so is
    100/x, so we need no second condition on x.

       We next find p(x) and set it equal to zero. Write
                                       p(x) = 2 - 200/x2 = 0.

   Solving for x gives us x = ±10. We are interested only in x > 0, so only the
                                                                                 calculus 151

value x = 10 is of interest. Since p(x) is defined everywhere on the interval
(0, ), there are no more critical values, and there are no endpoints. Is there
a local maximum, minimum, or neither at x = 10? The second derivative is
p(x) = 400/x3, and f (10) > 0, so there is a local minimum. Since there is
only one critical value, this is also the global minimum, so the rectangle with
smallest perimeter is the 10 cm×10 cm square.

Example 9.2.2 You want to sell a certain number n of items in order to
maximize your profit. Market research tells you that if you set the price at
$1.50, you will be able to sell 5000 items, and for every 10 cents you lower
the price below $1.50 you will be able to sell another 1000 items. Suppose
that your fixed costs ("start-up costs") total $2000, and the per item cost of
production ("marginal cost") is $0.50. Find the price to set per item and the
number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also determine the
maximum profit you can get.

Solution The first step is to convert the problem into a function maximization
problem. The revenue for selling n items at x dollars is given by

                                             r(x) = nx

and the cost of producing n items is given by

                                      c(x) = 2000 + 0.5n.

However, from the problem we see that the number of items sold is itself a
function of x,

                             n(x) = 5000 + 1000(1.5 - x)/0.10
152                                                                                                                            y

    So profit is give by:                                                                                                                      (x, a)

   P(x) = r(x) - c(x)                                                                                               A(x) = area
          = nx - (2000 + 0.5n)
          = (5000 + 1000(1.5 - x)/0.10)x - 2000 - 0.5(5000 + 1000(1.5 - x)/0.10)                                                               (x, x2)
          = -10000x2 + 25000x - 12000.
                                                                                                                                                                          x
    We want to know the maximum value of this function when x is between 0 and         Figure 9.6: A plot of the parabola y = x2 along with
   1.5. The derivative is P(x) = -20000x + 25000, which is zero when x = 1.25.         the line y = a and the rectangle in question.
   Since P(x) = -20000 < 0, there must be a local maximum at x = 1.25, and since
    this is the only critical value it must be a global maximum as well. Alternately,
   we could compute P(0) = -12000, P(1.25) = 3625, and P(1.5) = 3000 and
   note that P(1.25) is the maximum of these. Thus the maximum profit is $3625,
    attained when we set the price at $1.25 and sell 7500 items.

    Example 9.2.3 Find the rectangle with largest area that fits inside the graph
   of the parabola y = x2 below the line y = a, where a is an unspecified constant
   value, with the top side of the rectangle on the horizontal line y = a. See
    Figure 9.6.

   Solution We want to maximize value of A(x). The lower right corner of the
   rectangle is at (x, x2), and once this is chosen the rectangle is completely
    determined. Then the area is

                                 A(x) = (2x)(a - x2) = -2x3 + 2ax.
   We want the maximum value of A(x) when x is in [0, a]. You might object to
   allowing x = 0 or x = a, since then the "rectangle" has either no width or no
    height, so is not "really" a rectangle. But the problem is somewhat easier if we
    simply allow such rectangles, which have zero area as we may then apply the
    Extreme Value Theorem, Theorem 9.1.1.

       Setting 0 = A(x) = -6x2 + 2a we find x = a/3 as the only critical
   point. Testing this and the two endpoints, we have A(0) = A( a) = 0 and
   A( a/3) = (4/9) 3a3/2. Hence, the maximum area thus occurs when the
rectangle has dimensions 2 a/3 × (2/3)a.                                                                                    calculus 153

Example 9.2.4 If you fit the largest possible cone inside a sphere, what fraction             r 2 h
of the volume of the sphere is occupied by the cone? (Here by "cone" we mean          Vc = 3 r
a right circular cone, i.e., a cone for which the base is perpendicular to the
axis of symmetry, and for which the cross-section cut perpendicular to the                                            hR

and height of the cone inside the sphere. Our goal is to maximize the volume of
the cone: Vc = r2h/3. The largest r could be is R and the largest h could be is
2R.

    Notice that the function we want to maximize, r2h/3, depends on two

variables. Our next step is to find the relationship and use it to solve for one of

the variables in terms of the other, so as to have a function of only one variable

to maximize. In this problem, the condition is apparent in the figure, as the upper

corner of the triangle, whose coordinates are (r, h - R), must be on the circle of

radius R. Write

                 r2 + (h - R)2 = R2.

Solving for r2, since r2 is found in the formula for the volume of the cone, we find

                 r2 = R2 - (h - R)2.

Substitute this into the formula for the volume of the cone to find

                 Vc(h) = (R2 - (h - R)2)h/3

                 = -  h3 + 2 h2R
                 3  3

We want to maximize Vc(h) when h is between 0 and 2R. We solve

                 Vc(h) = -h2 + (4/3)hR = 0,

   finding h = 0 or h = 4R/3. We compute                                                                       h
                                                                                                                                      V = r2h
                   Vc(0) = Vc(2R) = 0 and Vc(4R/3) = (32/81)R3.

    fraction of the sphere occupied by the cone is                                        the cylinder.

                                      (32/81)R3 = 8  30%.

    Example 9.2.5 You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given vol-
    ume. Suppose that the top and bottom are made of a material that is N times
    as expensive (cost per unit area) as the material used for the lateral side of the
    cylinder. Find (in terms of N ) the ratio of height to base radius of the cylinder
    that minimizes the cost of making the containers.

    Solution First we draw a picture, see Figure 9.8. Now we can write an
    expression for the cost of materials:

                                         C = 2crh + 2r2Nc.

   Since we know that V = r2h, we can use this relationship to eliminate h (we
    could eliminate r, but it's a little easier if we eliminate h, which appears in only
    one place in the above formula for cost). We find

                                      C(r) = 2cr r2 V + 2Ncr2
                                             = 2cV + 2Ncr2.
                                                       r

   We want to know the minimum value of this function when r is in (0, ). Setting

                                    C(r) = -2cV/r2 + 4Ncr = 0

   we find r = 3 V/(2N). Since C(r) = 4cV/r3 + 4Nc is positive when r is
    positive, there is a local minimum at the critical value, and hence a global
    minimum since there is only one critical value.
                                                                                                  calculus 155

   Finally, since h = V/(r2),

                                             hV
                                         r = r3

                                           =V
                                               (V/(2N))

                                           = 2N,

so the minimum cost occurs when the height h is 2N times the radius. If, for
example, there is no difference in the cost of materials, the height is twice the
radius.

Example 9.2.6 Suppose you want to reach a point A that is located across                                A
the sand from a nearby road, see Figure 9.9. Suppose that the road is straight,
and b is the distance from A to the closest point C on the road. Let v be your                 w        b
speed on the road, and let w, which is less than v, be your speed on the sand.
Right now you are at the point D, which is a distance a from C. At what point
B should you turn off the road and head across the sand in order to minimize
your travel time to A?

Solution Let x be the distance short of C where you turn off, the distance from       v           x

                                                                                   D     B           C

B to C. We want to minimize the total travel time. Recall that when traveling at            a

constant velocity, time is distance divided by velocity.                           Figure 9.9: A road where one travels at rate v, with
                                                                                   sand where one travels at rate w. Where should one
You travel the distance from D to B at speed v, and then the distance from B       turn off of the road to minimize total travel time from
                                                                                   D to A?
to A at speed w. The distance from D to B is a - x. By the Pythagorean theorem,

the distance from B to A is  
                               x2 + b2.

Hence the total time for the trip is
                                            a - x x2 + b2

                                  T (x) = v + w .
We want to find the minimum value of T when x is between 0 and a. As usual
156

we set T (x) = 0 and solve for x. Write

              T (x) = - 1 +  x = 0.
                          v w x2 + b2

We find that

              x =  wb
                      v2 - w2

Notice that a does not appear in the last expression, but a is not irrelevant, since
                                                                                       

we are interested only in critical values that are in [0, a], and wb/ v2 - w2 is

either in this interval or not. If it is, we can use the second derivative to test it:

              T (x) =                    b2
                                                    .
                       (x2 + b2)3/2w

Since this is always positive there is a local minimum at the critical point, and
so it is a global minimum as well.

   If the critical value is not in [0, a] it is larger than a. In this case the minimum
must occur at one of the endpoints. We can compute

                                        T (0) = a + b
                                                       vw
                                                  a2 + b2

                                        T (a) = w

but it is difficult to determine which of these is smaller by direct comparison. If,
as is likely in practice, we know the values of v, w, a, and b, then it is easy to
determine this. With a little cleverness, however, we can determine the minimum
in general. We have seen that T (x) is always positive, so the derivative T (x) is

                                                      
always increasing. We know that at wb/ v2 - w2 the derivative is zero, so for
values of x less than that critical value, the derivative is negative. This means
that T (0) > T (a), so the minimum occurs when x = a. 

   So the upshot is this: If you start farther away from C than wb/ v2 - w2 then
                                                                                          

you always want to cut across the sand when you are a distance wb/ v2 - w2
from point C. If you start closer than this to C, you should cut directly across the
sand.

10 Linear Approximation

10.1 Linear Approximation and Differentials

Given a function, a linear approximation is a fancy phrase for something you already
know.

   Definition If f (x) is a differentiable function at x = a, then a linear approxi-
   mation for f (x) at x = a is given by

                                      (x) = f (a)(x - a) + f (a).

   A linear approximation of f (x) is a good approximation of f (x) as long as x        y
is "not too far" from a. As we see from Figure 3.1, if one can "zoom in" on f (x)     5
sufficiently, then f (x) and the linear approximation are nearly indistinguishable.
Linear approximations allow us to make approximate "difficult" computations.          4

   Example 10.1.1 Use a linear approximation of f (x) = 3 x at x = 64 to approx-                     (x )
   imate 3 50.                                                                        3

                                                                                                     f (x)
                                                                                      2

    so our linear approximation is                                                        1

   Now we evaluate (50)  3.71 and compare it to 3 50  3.68, see Figure 10.1.
    From this we see that the linear approximation, while perhaps inexact, is
    computationally easier than computing the cube root.

    With modern calculators and computing software it may not appear necessary to
use linear approximations. But in fact they are quite useful. In cases requiring an
explicit numerical approximation, they allow us to get a quick rough estimate which
can be used as a "reality check" on a more complex calculation. In some complex
calculations involving functions, the linear approximation makes an otherwise
intractable calculation possible, without serious loss of accuracy.

   Example 10.1.2 Use a linear approximation of f (x) = sin(x) at x = 0 to
   approximate sin(0.3).

                                                                                     -/2

Solution To start, write        d f (x) = cos(x),                                                                   -1
so our linear approximation is  dx                                                                (x )

(x) = cos(0) · (x - 0) + 0                                                           Figure 10.2: A linear approximation of f (x) = sin(x)
     = x.                                                                            at x = 0.

Hence a linear approximation for sin(x) at x = 0 is (x) = x, and so (0.3) = 0.3.
Comparing this to sin(.3)  0.295. As we see the approximation is quite good.
For this reason, it is common to approximate sin(x) with its linear approximation
(x) = x when x is near zero, see Figure 10.2.

The notion of a differential goes back to the origins of calculus, though our modern
conceptualization of a differential is somewhat different than how they were initially   y
understood.

                                             dy = f (x) · dx.                           Figure 10.3: While dy and dx are both variables,
                                                                                        dy depends on dx, and approximates how much a

                                                                                        point.
Note, it is now the case (by definition!) that

                       dy = f (x).
                       dx

Essentially, differentials allow us to solve the problems presented in the previous

examples from a slightly different point of view. Recall, when h is near but not equal

zero,                  f (x)  f (x + h) - f (x)
                                           h

hence,

                       f (x)h  f (x + h) - f (x)

since h is simply a variable, and dx is simply a variable, we can replace h with dx
to write

                       f (x) · dx  f (x + dx) - f (x)
                               dy  f (x + dx) - f (x).

From this we see that

                       f (x + dx)  dy + f (x).

While this is something of a "sleight of hand" with variables, there are contexts
where the language of differentials is common. We will repeat our previous examples
using differentials.

   Now f (.3)  f (0) + 0.3  0.3.

    The upshot is that linear approximations and differentials are simply two slightly
different ways of doing the exact same thing.

10.2 Iterative Methods

Newton's Method

Suppose you have a function f (x), and you want to solve f (x) = 0. Solving equations
symbolically is difficult. However, Newton's method gives us a procedure, for finding
a solution to many equations to as many decimal places as you want.

Newton's Method Let f (x) be a differentiable function and let a0 be a guess                 The point
for a solution to the equation                                                                                    an+1 = an - f f (an ) (an )

                                            f (x) = 0.                                       is the solution to the equation n (x) = 0, where n (x)
                                                                                             is the linear approximation of f (x) at x = an .
We can produce a sequence of points x = a0, a1, a2, a3, . . . via the recursive
                                                                                              y
formula              an+1 = an - f f (an) (an)
                                                                                                                                                                                  x
that (hopefully!) are successively better approximations of a solution to the                                                                                       a0
                                                                                             Figure 10.6: Here we see our first guess, along with
equation f (x) = 0.                                                                          the linear approximation at that point.

Let's see if we can explain the logic behind this method. Consider the following
cubic function

                                      f (x) = x3 - 4x2 - 5x - 7.

While there is a "cubic formula" for finding roots, it can be difficult to implement.
Since it is clear that f (10) is positive, and f (0) is negative, by the Intermediate Value
Theorem 2.3.3, there is a solution to the equation f (x) = 0 in the interval [0, 10].
Let's compute f (x) = 3x2 - 8x - 5 and guess that a0 = 7 is a solution. We can easily
see that

                      f (a0) = f (7) = 105 and f (a0) = f (7) = 86.

This might seem pretty bad, but if we look at the linear approximation of f (x) at
x = 7, we find

 0(x) = 86(x - 7) + 105 which is the same as 0(x) = f (a0)(x - a0) + f (a0).
Now 0(a1) = 0 when                                                                                                               calculus 167

a1 = 7 - 105              which is the same as        a1 = a0 - f f (a0) (a . 0)             y
              86

To remind you what is going on geometrically see Figure 10.6. Now we repeat the
procedure letting a1 be our new guess. Now

                          f (a1)  23.5.

We see our new guess is better than our first. If we look at the linear approximation
of f (x) at x = a1, we find

                          1(x) = f (a1)(x - a1) + f (a1).

Now 1(a2) = 0 when                                                                                  a1  a0                                         x

                          a2 = a1 - f f (a1) (a . 1)

See Figure 10.7 to see what is going on geometrically.     Again, we repeat our              Figure 10.7: Here we see our second guess, along
                                                                                             with the linear approximation at that point.
procedure letting a2 be our next guess, note

                          f (a2)  2.97,

we are getting much closer to a root of f (x). Looking at the linear approximation of        y

f (x) at x = a2, we find

                          2(x) = f (a2)(x - a2) + f (a2).

Setting a3 = a2 - f f (a2) (a , a 2) 3  5.22. We now have 2(a3) = 0. Checking by evaluating
f (x) at a3, we find

                                              f (a3)  0.14.

   We are now very close to a root of f (x), see Figure 10.8. This process, Newton's            a2  a1                x
Method, could be repeated indefinitely to obtain closer and closer approximations                       a0
to a root of f (x).

Example 10.2.1 Use Newton's Method to approximate the solution to

                          x3 = 50                                                            Figure 10.8: Here we see our third guess, along with
                                                                                             the linear approximation at that point.

to two decimal places.

Solution To start, set f (x) = x3 - 50. We will use Newton's Method to approxi-
mate a solution to the equation

                                      f (x) = x3 - 50 = 0.

Let's choose a0 = 4 as our first guess. Now compute
                                           f (x) = 3x2.

At this point we can make a table:

     n an               f (an)      an - f (an)/f (an)

     04                 14           3.708

     1 3.708  0.982  3.684

     2 3.684  -0.001  3.684

Hence after only two iterations, we have the solution to three (and hence two)
decimal places.

    In practice, which is to say, if you need to approximate a value in the course of
designing a bridge or a building or an airframe, you will need to have some confidence
that the approximation you settle on is accurate enough. As a rule of thumb, once
a certain number of decimal places stop changing from one approximation to the
next it is likely that those decimal places are correct. Still, this may not be enough
assurance, in which case we can test the result for accuracy.

    Sometimes questions involving Newton's Method do not mention an equation that
needs to be solved. Here you must reinterpret the question as one that is asking for
a solution to an equation of the form f (x) = 0.

   Example 10.2.2 Use Newton's Method to approximate 3 50 to two decimal
    places.
                                                                                  calculus 169

Solution The 3 50 is simply a solution to the equation

                                           x3 - 50 = 0.
Since we did this in the previous example, we have found 3 50  3.68.

Warning Sometimes a bad choice for a0 will not lead to a root. Consider
                                    f (x) = x3 - 3x2 - x - 4.

If we choose our initial guess to be a0 = 1 and make a table we find:

n an  f (an)  an - f (an)/f (an)

01    -7      -0.75

1 -0.75  -5.359  0.283

2 0.283  -4.501  -1.548

3 -1.548  -13.350  -0.685

4 -0.685  -5.044  0.432

      ....................

As you can see, we are not converging to a root, which is approximately
x = 3.589.

    Iterative procedures like Newton's method are well suited for computers. It
enables us to solve equations that are otherwise impossible to solve through
symbolic methods.

Euler's Method                                                                    The name "Euler" is pronounced "Oiler."

While Newton's Method allows us to solve equations that are otherwise impossible
to solve, and hence is of computational importance, Euler's Method is more of
theoretical importance to us.

 Euler's Method Given a function f (x), and an initial value (x0, y0) we wish
 to find a polygonal curve defined by (xn, yn) such that this polygonal curve
 approximates F (x) where F (x) = f (x), and F (x0) = y0.

(a) Choose a step size, call it h.

(b) Our polygonal curve defined by connecting the points as described by the
     iterative process below:

     n xn  yn

     0 x0  y0

     1 x0 + h y0 + h · f (x0)

     2 x1 + h y1 + h · f (x1)

     3 x2 + h y2 + h · f (x2)

     4 x3 + h y3 + h · f (x3)

           ...........

Let's see an example of Euler's Method in action.                                 y
                                                                               3
Example 10.2.3 Suppose that the velocity in meters per second of a ball
tossed from a height of 1 meter is given by                                    2          F (x)

                                        v(t) = -9.8t + 6.

Rounding to two decimals at each step, use Euler's Method with h = 0.2 to
approximate the height of the ball after 1 second.

                                                                               1

                                                                               approximation.

Solution We simply need to make a table and use Euler's Method.

                                               n tn yn
                                               00 1

                                               2 0.4 3.01
                                               3 0.6 3.42
                                               4 0.8 3.45
                                               5 1 3.08

Hence the ball is at a height of about 3.08 meters, see Figure 10.9.

 Here are some interesting questions involving derivatives:                                 f (x)

(a) Suppose you toss a ball into the air and then catch it. Must the ball's vertical               a  c                                       x
     velocity have been zero at some point?
                                                                                                         b
(b) Suppose you drive a car from toll booth on a toll road to another toll booth 30
     miles away in half of an hour. Must you have been driving at 60 miles per hour      Figure 10.10: A geometric interpretation of Rolle's
     at some point?                                                                      Theorem.

(c) Suppose two different functions have the same derivative. What can you say
     about the relationship between the two functions?

     While these problems sound very different, it turns out that the problems are
 very closely related. We'll start simply:

     Theorem 10.3.1 (Rolle's Theorem) Suppose that f (x) is differentiable on
     the interval (a, b), is continuous on the interval [a, b], and f (a) = f (b). Then

                                                  f (c) = 0

      for some a < c < b.

    Proof By the Extreme Value Theorem, Theorem 9.1.1, we know that f (x) has a
    maximum and minimum value on [a, b].

        If maximum and minimum both occur at the endpoints, then f (x) = f (a) = f (b)
    at every point in [a, b]. Hence the function is a horizontal line, and it has
    derivative zero everywhere on (a, b). We may choose any c at all to get f (c) = 0.

         If the maximum or minimum occurs at a point c with a < c < b, then by
    Fermat's Theorem, Theorem 4.1.1, f (c) = 0.

     We can now answer our first question above.
174

Example 10.3.2 Suppose you toss a ball into the air and then catch it. Must
the ball's vertical velocity have been zero at some point?

Solution If p(t) is the position of the ball at time t, then we may apply Rolle's
Theorem to see at some time c, p(c) = 0. Hence the velocity must be zero at
some point.

Rolle's Theorem is a special case of a more general theorem.

Theorem 10.3.3 (Mean Value Theorem) Suppose that f (x) has a derivative            y
on the interval (a, b) and is continuous on the interval [a, b]. Then

                     f (c) = f (b) - f (a)
                                  b-a

for some a < c < b.

Proof Let

                     m = f (b) - f (a) ,
                               b-a

and consider a new function g(x) = f (x) - m(x - a) - f (a). We know that

g(x) has a derivative on [a, b], since g(x) = f (x) - m. We can compute

g(a) = f (a) - m(a - a) - f (a) = 0 and                                                               x
                                                                                            b
     g(b) = f (b) - m(b - a) - f (a) = f (b) - f (b) - f (a) (b - a) - f (a)          a  c
                                                          b-a
                                                                                   Figure 10.11: A geometric interpretation of the Mean
                                           = f (b) - (f (b) - f (a)) - f (a)       Value Theorem
                                           = 0.

So g(a) = g(b) = 0. Now by Rolle's Theorem, that at some c,

                     g(c) = 0 for some a < c < b.

But we know that g(c) = f (c) - m, so
                            0 = f (c) - m = f (c) - f (b) - f (a) .
                                                              b-a
                                                                                         calculus 175

Hence        f (c) = f (b) - f (a) .
                          b-a

We can now answer our second question above.

Example 10.3.4 Suppose you drive a car from toll booth on a toll road to
another toll booth 30 miles away in half of an hour. Must you have been
driving at 60 miles per hour at some point?

Solution If p(t) is the position of the car at time t, and 0 hours is the starting

time with 1/2 hours being the final time, the Mean Value Theorem states there

is a time c  p(c) = 30 - 0 = 60
                         1/2
                                 where 0 < c < 1/2.

Since the derivative of position is velocity, this says that the car must have been

driving at 60 miles per hour at some point.

   Now we will address the unthinkable, could there be a function f (x) whose
derivative is zero on an interval that is not constant? As we will see, the answer is
"no."

Theorem 10.3.5 If f (x) = 0 for all x in an interval I, then f (x) is constant on
I.

Proof Let a < b be two points in I. By the Mean Value Theorem we know
                                       f (b) - f (a) = f (c)
                                           b-a

for some c in the interval (a, b). Since f (c) = 0 we see that f (b) = f (a). Moreover,
since a and b were arbitrarily chosen, f (x) must be the constant function.

Now let's answer our third question.
176                                                                                 y
                                                                                  4
    Example 10.3.6 Suppose two different functions have the same derivative.
    What can you say about the relationship between the two functions?            2
   Solution Set h(x) = f (x) - g(x), so h(x) = f (x) - g(x). Now h(x) = 0 on the
   interval (a, b). This means that h(x) = k where k is some constant. Hence                                                            x

                                             g(x) = f (x) + k.

   Solution One such function is - cos(x), so all such functions have the form
   - cos(x) + k, see Figure 10.12.

11 Antiderivatives

11.1 Basic Antiderivatives

Computing derivatives is not too difficult. At this point, you should be able to
take the derivative of almost any function you can write down. However, undoing
derivatives is much harder. This process of undoing a derivative is called taking an
antiderivative.

   Definition A function F (x) is called an antiderivative of f (x) on an interval if
                                               F (x) = f (x)

   for all x in the interval.
    We have special notation for the antiderivative:

   Definition The antiderivative is denoted by

                                            f (x) dx = F (x) + C,
   where dx identifies x as the variable and C is a constant indicating that there
   are many possible antiderivatives, each varying by the addition of a constant.
   This is often called the indefinite integral.
    Here are the basic antiderivatives. Note each of these examples comes directly
from our knowledge of basic derivatives.
                                                                                       calculus 179

Theorem 11.1.1 (Basic Antiderivatives)

· k dx = kx + C.                        · cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C.                      · sec(x) tan(x) dx = sec(x) + C.
                                        · sin(x) dx = - cos(x) + C.
      xn dx = xn+1 + C (n -1).          · tan(x) dx = - ln | cos(x)| + C.              · csc(x) cot(x) dx = - csc(x) + C.
·                                       · sec2(x) dx = tan(x) + C.                               1 dx = arctan(x) + C.
                                        · csc2(x) dx = - cot(x) + C.
                  n+1                                                                  · x2 + 1
· ex dx = ex + C.                                                                      ·  1 dx = arcsin(x) + C.

· ax dx = a + C. x                                                                              1 - x2
                  ln(a)

· 1 dx = ln |x| + C.

It may seem that one could simply memorize these antiderivatives and antidifferen-
tiating would be as easy as differentiating. This is not the case. The issue comes
up when trying to combine these functions. When taking derivatives we have the
product rule and the chain rule. The analogues of these two rules are much more
difficult to deal with when taking antiderivatives. However, not all is lost. We have
the following analogue of the Sum Rule for derivatives, Theorem 3.2.6.

Theorem 11.1.2 (The Sum Rule for Antiderivatives) Given two functions
f (x) and g(x) where k is a constant:
· kf (x) dx = kF (x) + C.

· (f (x) + g(x)) dx = F (x) + G(x) + C.

Let's put this rule and our knowledge of basic derivatives to work.

Example 11.1.3 Compute

                        3x7 dx.
180

    Solution By Theorem 11.1.1 and Theorem 11.1.2, we see that
                                            3x7 dx = 3 x7 dx
                                                     = 3 · x8 + C.
                                                                   8

    The sum rule for antiderivatives, Theorem 11.1.2, allows us to integrate term-by-
term. Let's see an example of this.

    Example 11.1.4 Compute
                                           x4 + 5x2 - cos(x) dx.

    Solution Let's start by simplifying the problem using the sum rule for an-
    tiderivatives, Theorem 11.1.2.

                  x4 + 5x2 - cos(x) dx = x4 dx + 5 x2 dx - cos(x) dx.

    Now we may integrate term-by-term to find
                           x4 + 5x2 - cos(x) dx = x5 + 5x3 - sin(x) + C.
                                                                  53

Warning While the sum rule for antiderivatives allows us to integrate term-by-
term, we cannot integrate factor-by-factor, meaning that in general

     f (x)g(x) dx  f (x) dx · g(x) dx.

Tips for Guessing Antiderivatives

Unfortunately, we cannot tell you how to compute every antiderivative. We advise
that the mathematician view antiderivatives as a sort of puzzle. Later we will learn
a hand-full of techniques for computing antiderivatives. However, a robust and
simple way to compute antiderivatives is guess-and-check.
                                                                                 calculus 181

 How to Guess Antiderivatives

(a) Make a guess for the antiderivative.

(b) Take the derivative of your guess.

(c) Note how the above derivative is different from the function whose an-
     tiderivative you want to find.

(d) Change your original guess by multiplying by constants or by adding in
     new functions.

Template 11.1.5 If the indefinite integral looks something like
                         stuff · (stuff)n dx then guess stuffn+1

where n -1.

Example 11.1.6 Compute    x3

                          x4 - 6  dx.

Solution Start by rewriting the indefinite integral as

                        x3 x4 - 6 -1/2 dx.

Now start with a guess of
                                x3 x4 - 6 -1/2 dx  x4 - 6 1/2 .

Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
                           d x4 - 6 1/2 = (4/2)x3 x4 - 6 -1/2 .
                              dx

We're off by a factor of 2/4, so multiply our guess by this constant to get the
182

solution,     x3
           
           x4 - 6        dx = (2/4) x4 - 6 1/2 + C.

Template 11.1.7 If the indefinite integral looks something like
                    junk · estuff dx then guess estuff or junk · estuff.

Example 11.1.8 Compute

                         xex dx.

Solution We try to guess the antiderivative. Start with a guess of
                                            xex dx  xex .

Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
                                        d xex = ex + xex .
                                            dx

Ah! So we need only subtract ex from our original guess. We now find
                                      xex dx = xex - ex + C.

Template 11.1.9 If the indefinite integral looks something like

           stuff         then guess   ln(stuff).
                   dx

           stuff

Example 11.1.10 Compute

                           2x 2
                         7x3 + 3 dx.
                                                                                   calculus 183

Solution We'll start with a guess of

  2x2 dx  ln(7x3 + 3).
7x3 + 3

Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:

d   3                                 21x 2
    ln(7x + 3) = 3 .
dx                                    7x + 3

We are only off by a factor of 2/21, so we need to multiply our original guess by
this constant to get the solution,

  2x2 dx = (2/21) ln(7x3 + 3) + C.
7x3 + 3

Template 11.1.11 If the indefinite integral looks something like
           junk · sin(stuff) dx then guess cos(stuff) or junk · cos(stuff),

likewise if you have
           junk · cos(stuff) dx then guess sin(stuff) or junk · sin(stuff),

Example 11.1.12 Compute
                                         x4 sin(3x5 + 7) dx.

Solution Here we simply try to guess the antiderivative. Start with a guess of
                               x4 sin(3x5 + 7) dx  cos(3x5 + 7).

To see if your guess is correct, take the derivative of cos(3x5 + 7),
                           d cos(3x5 + 7) = -15x4 sin(3x5 + 7).
                              dx
184

   We are off by a factor of -1/15. Hence we should multiply our original guess by
    this constant to find

                               x4 sin(3x5 + 7) dx = - cos(3x5 + 7) + C.
                                                                        15

Final Thoughts
Computing antiderivatives is a place where insight and rote computation meet. We
cannot teach you a method that will always work. Moreover, merely understanding
the examples above will probably not be enough for you to become proficient in
computing antiderivatives. You must practice, practice, practice!

11.2 Differential Equations

A differential equation is simply an equation with a derivative in it like this:

                                              f (x) = kf (x).

When a mathematician solves a differential equation, they are finding a function
that satisfies the equation.

Falling Objects
Recall that the acceleration due to gravity is about -9.8 m/s2. Since the first
derivative of the function giving the velocity of an object gives the acceleration of the
object and the second derivative of a function giving the position of a falling object
gives the acceleration, we have the differential equations

                                               v(t) = -9.8,
                                              p(t) = -9.8.

From these simple equation, we can derive equations for the velocity of the object
and for the position using antiderivatives.

    Example 11.2.1 A ball is tossed into the air with an initial velocity of 15 m/s.
    What is the velocity of the ball after 1 second? How about after 2 seconds?

   Solution Knowing that the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s2, we write
                                               v(t) = -9.8.

    To solve this differential equation, take the antiderivative of both sides

                                            v(t) dt = -9.8 dt
                                                v(t) = -9.8t + C.

    Here C represents the initial velocity of the ball. Since it is tossed up with an
188

    initial velocity of 15 m/s,
                                       15 = v(0) = -9.8 · 0 + C,

   and we see that C = 15. Hence v(t) = -9.8t + 15. Now v(1) = 5.2 m/s, the ball
   is rising, and v(2) = -4.6 m/s, the ball is falling.
    Now let's do a similar problem, but instead of finding the velocity, we will find
the position.
    Example 11.2.2 A ball is tossed into the air with an initial velocity of 15 m/s
    from a height of 2 meters. When does the ball hit the ground?
   Solution Knowing that the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s2, we write

                                              p(t) = -9.8.
    Start by taking the antiderivative of both sides of the equation

                                           p(t) dt = -9.8 dt
                                               p(t) = -9.8t + C.

    Here C represents the initial velocity of the ball. Since it is tossed up with an
   initial velocity of 15 m/s, C = 15 and

                                           p(t) = -9.8t + 15.
    Now let's take the antiderivative again.

                                       p(t) dt = -9.8t + 15 dt
                                           p(t) = -9.8t2 + 15t + D.
                                                             2

    Since we know the initial height was 2 meters, write

   Hence p(t) = -9.8t2 + 15t + 2. We need to know when the ball hits the ground,
                           2

   this is when p(t) = 0. Solving the equation
                                         -9.8t2 + 15t + 2 = 0
                                                  2

   we find two solutions t  -0.1 and t  3.2. Discarding the negative solution,
    we see the ball will hit the ground after approximately 3.2 seconds.
    The power of calculus is that it frees us from rote memorization of formulas and
enables us to derive what we need.

Exponential Growth and Decay
A function f (x) exhibits exponential growth if its growth rate is proportional to its
value. As a differential equation, this means

                  f (x) = kf (x) for some constant of proportionality k.
We claim that this differential equation is solved by f (x) = Aekx , where A and k are
constants. Check it out, if f (x) = Aekx , then

                                            f (x) = Akekx
                                                   = k Aekx
                                                   = kf (x).

    Example 11.2.3 A culture of yeast starts with 100 cells. After 160 minutes,
    there are 350 cells. Assuming that the growth rate of the yeast is proportional
    to the number of yeast cells present, estimate when the culture will have 1000
    cells.
    Solution Since the growth rate of the yeast is proportional to the number of
    yeast cells present, we have the following differential equation

                                               p(t) = kp(t)

   where p(t) is the population of the yeast culture and t is time measured in
190

minutes. We know that this differential equation is solved by the function

                         p(t) = Aekt

where A and k are yet to be determined constants. Since
                                       100 = p(0) = Aek·0

we see that A = 100. So

                         p(t) = 100ekt .

Now we must find k. Since we know that

                         350 = p(160) = 100ek·160

we need to solve for k. Write

                                              350 = 100ek·160
                                              3.5 = ek·160
                                          ln(3.5) = k · 160
                                   ln(3.5)/160 = k.

Hence

       p(t) = 100et ln(3.5)/160 = 100 · 3.5t/160.

To find out when the culture has 1000 cells, write

                                         1000 = 100 · 3.5t/160
                                            10 = 3.5t/160

                                        ln(10) = t ln(3.5)
                                                            160

                                  160 ln(10) = t.
                                    ln(3.5)

From this we find that after approximately 294 minutes, there are around 1000
yeast cells present.
                                                                                       calculus 191

    It is worth seeing an example of exponential decay as well. Consider this: Living
tissue contains two types of carbon, a stable isotope carbon-12 and a radioactive
(unstable) isotope carbon-14. While an organism is alive, the ratio of one isotope of
carbon to the other is always constant. When the organism dies, the ratio changes
as the radioactive isotope decays. This is the basis of radiocarbon dating.

    Example 11.2.4 The half-life of carbon-14 (the time it takes for half of an
    amount of carbon-14 to decay) is about 5730 years. If the rate of decay is
    proportional to the amount of carbon-14, and if we found a bone with 1/70th
    of the amount of carbon-14 we would expect to find in a living organism,
    approximately how old is the bone?

Solution Since the rate of decay of carbon-14 is proportional to the amount of
carbon-14 present, we can model this situation with the differential equation

                                    f (t) = kf (t).

We know that this differential equation is solved by the function defined by

                                    f (t) = Aekt

where A and k are yet to be determined constants. Since the half-life of carbon-14

is about 5730 years we write        1 = ek5730.
                                    2

Solving this equation for k, gives

                                           k = - ln(2) .
                                                       5730

Since we currently have 1/70th of the original amount of carbon-14 we write

                                                       - ln(2)t

                              70 = 1 · e 5730 .

Solving this equation for t, we find t  -35121. This means that the bone is
approximately 35121 years old.

    Procedure for Constructing a Slope Field It is usually easiest to construct
    a slope field using a computer algebra system. Nevertheless, the general
    theory of constructing a slope field must be understood before one can do
    this. Suppose you have a differential equation relating f (x) and f (x).
     · Choose a value for dx, this will be your step-size.
    · Plot points on an (x, y)-plane in increments of size dx.
    · For each point plotted, assume this point is on the curve f (x).
     · Now use your differential equation to plot an arrow pointing in the direction

       of (dx, dy) from the given point, where dy = f (x)dx. This means one draws
       an arrow in the same direction as the arrow from (x, y) to (x + dx, y + dy).

    Consider the differential equation

                                     f (x) = (f (x))2 - 6f (x) + 8.

if the step-size is dx = 1, and we are at the point (3, 1) then we should plot an arrow
in the same direction as the arrow whose tail is at (3, 1) and whose tip is at

                               (3 + 1, 1 + f (1)) = (4, 1 + 1 - 6 + 8)
                                                     = (4, 4).

Let's examine the slope field for f (x):

    Every solution to the differential equation should follow the arrows in the slope
field. Compare this slope field to the solutions found in Example 11.2.5, Exam-
ple 11.2.6, and Example 11.2.7. The slope field allows us to examine each solution
of the given differential equation simultaneously--this often gives more insight into
a problem than a single solution.

Accumulation Functions

While the definite integral computes a signed area, which is a fixed number, there
is a way to turn it into a function.

by

between f (t) and the t-axis. Hence t is playing the role of a "place-holder" and
represents numbers where we are evaluating f (t). On the other hand, x is the          -1                                                             t

Solution We can see a plot of f (t) along with the signed area measured by the
accumulation function in Figure 12.3. The accumulation function starts off at
zero, and then is decreasing as it accumulates negatively signed area. However
when x > 0, F (x) starts to accumulate positively signed area, and hence is
increasing. Thus F (x) is increasing on (0, 1), decreasing on (-1, 0) and hence
has a local minimum at (0, 0).

Working with the accumulation function leads us to a question, what is

With this in mind, let's consider one more example.                                                                                   y

Example 12.1.5 Consider the following accumulation function for f (x) = x3.               x               -1                                     t

           F (x) =    x                                                                                   +

                       t3 dt.                                                                                                     -2

                    -1

Where is F (x) increasing? Where is F (x) decreasing? When does F (x) have a                                            -4
extrema?

Solution From our previous example, we know that F (x) is increasing on (0, 1).                                         -6
Since f (t) continues to be positive at t = 1 and beyond, F (x) is increasing on
(0, ). On the other hand, we know from our previous example that F (x) is                                               -8
decreasing on (-1, 0). For values to the left of t = -1, F (x) is still decreasing, as
less and less positively signed area is accumulated. Hence F (x) is increasing            Figure 12.4:    The integral            -10
on (0, ), decreasing on (-, 0) and hence has an absolute minimum at (0, 0).                                Note, since
                                                                                          shaded area.                      x

                                                                                                                             t3 dt measures the

                                                                                                                         -1

                                                                                                                        x < -1, the area has

    The key point to take from these examples is that an accumulation function

                                                                                 x

                                                     f (t) dt

                                                                               a

is increasing precisely when f (t) is positive and is decreasing precisely when f (t) is
negative. In short, it seems that f (x) is behaving in a similar fashion to F (x).

12.2 Riemann Sums                                                                                           y

In the first section we learned that integrals compute signed area. However, we gave
no indication as to how this area is computed. Suppose you want to integrate f (x)
from a to b, see Figure 12.7. Start by partitioning the interval [a, b] by making a list

                               a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · xn-1 < xn = b
and considering the subintervals where

                   [x0, x1]  [x1, x2]  · · ·  [xn-1, xn] = [a, b].

For  each    subinterval   pick       a  point        [xi ,  xi+1]  and  evaluate  your  function  f  (x )

                                                xi

at each of these points, see Figure 12.8. We can now compute the area of the                                                                                              x

rectangles defined by the width of the subinterval [xi , xi+1] and the height f (xi).                          a                                                   b

Adding the areas of these rectangles together we find                                                       Figure 12.7: A plot of f (x) along with the area com-

    If we take the limit of all such sums as the partitions get finer and finer, we
obtain closer and closer approximations, see Figure 12.9. Sums of the form we are
describing are called Riemann sums.

Riemann sums give a mechanism though which integrals could be computed. Let's
give it a try.

Example 12.2.1 Compute the left Riemann sum that approximates                            y

                                                                 2

                                            x2 - 2x + 2 dx

                                                               1

using four equally spaced partitions of the interval [1, 2].

Solution Start by setting f (x) = x2 - 2x + 2 and examining Figure 12.10. Our                                       f (x3)
partition of [1, 2] is
                                                                                                            f (x2)

                                                                                            f (x0)  f (x1)

                  [1, 1.25]  [1.25, 1.5]  [1.5, 1.75]  [1.75, 2].

Hence our left Riemann sum is given by

     f (1)(1.25 - 1) + f (1.25)(1.5 - 1.25) + f (1.5)(1.75 - 1.5) + f (1.75)(2 - 1.75).     1                               2                  x

                                                                                                    1.25    1.5     1.75

This is equal to  1 + 17 + 5 + 25 = 39  1.22.                                            Figure 12.10: Here we see the interval [1, 2] parti-

    To guarantee that a Riemann sum is to equal the value of the related integral, we
need the number of subintervals to go to infinity as the width of our partitions goes
to zero. We'll work through an example of this.

                            (2x - 1) dx

                         3

Solution Start by setting f (x) = 2x - 1 and examining Figure 12.11. The
interval [3, 7] is divided into n subintervals each of width (7 - 3)/n. Our left
Riemann sum is now

                                n-1 f (3 + (7 - 3)i/n) 7 - 3 .
                                    i=0 n
Simplifying a bit we find                                                                                       calculus 205

                 n-1 f (3 + 4i/n) 4 n-1 = (2(3 + 4i/n) - 1) 4               y

                                    = n + n2
                                    i=0      i=0

                                    = 20 n-1 1 + 32 n-1 i
                                    n i=0    n i= 2 0
                                                                               ···
At this point we need two formulas

                 n-1                         n-1 n2 - n                     3                                         7             x
                                                 i= 2 .
                     1=n   and                                              Figure 12.11: We'll use a sum to compute

                 i=0

Substituting these formulas for the sums above, we find                          7

                                                                                  2x - 1 dx.

                                                        n

By construction

                  7 n-1 (2x - 1) dx = lim f (3 + (7 - 3)i/n) 7 - 3
                 3 n i=0 n

hence               7 (2x - 1) dx = lim 36 - 16 = 36.

13 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

13.1 The Fundamental Theorem

Let f (x) be continuous on the real numbers and consider

                                                                                        x

                                           F (x) = f (t) dt.

                                                                                      a

From our previous work we know that F (x) is increasing when f (x) is positive and
F (x) is decreasing when f (x) is negative. Moreover, with careful observation, we can
even see that F (x) is concave up when f (x) is positive and that F (x) is concave down
when f (x) is negative. Thinking about what we have learned about the relationship
of a function to its first and second derivatives, it is not too hard to guess that there
must be a connection between F (x) and the function f (x). This is a good guess,
check out our next theorem:

    Theorem 13.1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus--Version I)
    Suppose that f (x) is continuous on the real numbers and let

                                                                                        x

                                           F (x) = f (t) dt.

                                                                                      a

    Then F (x) = f (x).
                                                                                                                            calculus 209

Proof Using the limit definition of the derivative we'll compute F (x). Write

F (x) = lim F (x + h) - F (x)
                      h0                   h

                               1         x +h              x
                      = lim
                                             f (t) dt -     f (t) dt .
                         h0 h
                                        a                a

Recall that if the limits of integration are swapped, then the sign of the integral   y
is swapped, so we have                                                                                               f (x)

F (x) = lim 1                            x +h              a
           h0 h
                                             f (t) dt +     f (t) dt

                                        a                x

At this point, we can combine the integrals, as we are just "connecting" adjacent

signed areas to find

                      F (x) = lim 1               x +h                   (13.1)
                                 h0 h
                                                      f (t) dt.

                                                 x

Since f (x) is continuous on the interval [x, x + h], and h is approaching zero,

there is an  that goes to zero as h goes to zero such that

f (x) -  < f (x) < f (x) +  for all x  [x, x + h],

see Figure 13.1. This means that                                                      a                                     x x x + h     x

                                           x +h                                       Figure 13.1: Here we see f (x) along with a, x, x
                                                                                      and x + h.
(f (x) - )h <                                    f (t) dt < (f (x) + )h

                                        x

Dividing all sides by h we find

                      f (x) -  < 1          x +h
                                     h
                                                f (t) dt < f (x) + .

                                           x

Comparing this to Equation 13.1, and taking the limit as h goes to zero (remem-
bering that this also means that  goes to zero) we see that F (x) = f (x).

   The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that an accumulation function of f (x)
is an antiderivative of f (x). Because of the close relationship between an integral
and an antiderivative, the integral sign is also used to mean "antiderivative." You
210

can tell which is intended by whether the limits of integration are included. Hence

                                                                                b

                                                    f (x) dx

                                                                              a

is a definite integral, because it has a definite value--the signed area between f (x)
and the x-axis. On the other hand, we use

                                                    f (x) dx

to denote the antiderivative of f (x), also called an indefinite integral. This is evaluated
as

                                            f (x) dx = F (x) + C.

Where F (x) = f (x) and the constant C indicates that there are really an infinite
number of antiderivatives. We do not need to add this C to compute definite
integrals, but in other circumstances we will need to remember that the C is there,
so it is best to get into the habit of writing the C.

    There is a another common form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:

Theorem 13.1.2 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus--Version II)                                  Here the notation
Suppose that f (x) is continuous on the interval [a, b]. If F (x) is any an-
tiderivative of f (x), then                                                                                                                         b

        b  b                                                                                                                F (x)

           f (x) dx = F (x) = F (b) - F (a).                                                                                                        a

     a     a                                                                                  means that one should evaluate F (x) at b and then
                                                                                              subtract from this F (x) evaluated at a. Hence

                                                                                                                                     b

                                                                                                                  F (x) = F (b) - F (a).

                                                                                                                                     a

Proof We know from Theorem 13.1.1

                                                                                   x

                                       G(x) = f (t) dt

                                                                                 a

is an antiderivative of f (x), and therefore any antiderivative F (x) of f (x) is of
                                                                                    calculus 211

the form F (x) = G(x) + k. Then

F (b) - F (a) = G(b) + k - (G(a) + k)             = G(b) - G(a)

   b                                   a

= f (t) dt - f (t) dt.

a                                   a

                                                        a

It is not hard to see that f (t) dt = 0, so this means that

                                                      a

                                        b

      F (b) - F (a) = f (t) dt,

                                      a

which is exactly what Theorem 13.1.2 says.

    From this you should see that the two versions of the Fundamental Theorem are
very closely related. To avoid confusion, some people call the two versions of the
theorem "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus--Version I" and "The Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus--Version II", although unfortunately there is no universal
agreement as to which is "Version I" and which "Version II". Since it really is
the same theorem, differently stated, people often simply call them both "The
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus."

    Let's see an example of the fundamental theorem in action.

Example 13.1.3 Compute

                                    x 2 9 + 1 dx
                                          x
                                 1

Solution Here we start by finding an antiderivative of
                                              x9 + 1.
                                                           x

                              x 10
The correct choice is 10 + ln(x), one could verify this by taking the derivative.
212

Hence

          2 x9 + 1           x 10 2
             x      dx = 10 1 + ln(x)
       1

                    = 210 + ln(2) - 1 .
                    10  10

    When we compute a definite integral, we first find an antiderivative and then
substitute. It is convenient to first display the antiderivative and then do the
substitution; we need a notation indicating that the substitution is yet to be done.
A typical solution would look like this:

             2 x2 dx = x3 2 = 23 - 13 = 7 .
                    31 3 3 3
          1

The vertical line with subscript and superscript is used to indicate the operation
"substitute and subtract" that is needed to finish the evaluation.

    Now we know that to solve certain kinds of problems, those that lead to a sum of
a certain form, we "merely" find an antiderivative and substitute two values and
subtract. Unfortunately, finding antiderivatives can be quite difficult. While there
are a small number of rules that allow us to compute the derivative of any common
function, there are no such rules for antiderivatives. There are some techniques
that frequently prove useful, but we will never be able to reduce the problem to a
completely mechanical process.

Euler's Method
We have given a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, nevertheless it is
good to give intuition as to why it is true. Consider the following example:

    Example 13.1.4 Suppose that the velocity in meters per second of a ball
    tossed from a height of 1 meter is given by

                                            v(t) = -9.8t + 6.

    What is the height of the ball after 1 second?
                                                                                      calculus 213

Solution Since the derivative of position is velocity, and we want to know the
height (position) after one second, we need to compute

   1                                1

      -9.8t + 6 dt = (-4.9t2 + 6t)

0                                   0

      = -4.9 + 6 - 0

      = 1.1.

However, since the ball was tossed at an initial height of 1 meter, the ball is at a
height of 2.1 meters.

    We did this example before in Example 10.2.3. At that time we used Euler's
Method to give an approximate solution. Recall, the basic idea is to break the time
interval between 0 and 1 seconds into many small partitions. Then at each step
multiply the time duration by the velocity of the ball. In essence you are computing
a Riemann sum. Hence, Euler's method gives some rational as to why the area
under the curve that gives the velocity should give us the position of the ball.

    What's wrong with this? In some sense, nothing. As a practical matter it
is a very convincing argument, because our understanding of the relationship
between velocity and position seems to be quite solid. From the point of view
of mathematics, however, it is unsatisfactory to justify a purely mathematical
relationship by appealing to our understanding of the physical universe, which
could, however unlikely it is in this case, be wrong.

13.2 Area Between Curves                                                                                                     calculus 215

                                                                                            y

We have seen how integration can be used to find signed area between a curve and         10
the x-axis. With very little change we can find some areas between curves. Let's see
an example:                                                                                                         f (x)
                                                                                          5
Example 13.2.1 Find the area below f (x) = -x2 + 4x + 3 and above g(x) =
-x3 + 7x2 - 10x + 5 over the interval 1  x  2.                                                                                              g(x )

Solution In Figure 13.2 we show the two curves together, with the desired                0                                                                 x
area shaded.

   It is clear from the figure that the area we want is the area under f (x) minus
the area under g(x), which is to say

     2                         2             2                                              0      0.5  1  1.5  2                                  2.5  3

      f (x) dx -                g(x) dx =     (f (x) - g(x)) dx.                         Figure 13.2: The area below f (x) = -x2 + 4x + 3 and
                                                                                         above g(x) = -x3 + 7x2 - 10x + 5 over the interval
   1                         1             1

It doesn't matter whether we compute the two integrals on the left and then              1  x  2.
subtract or compute the single integral on the right. In this case, the latter is
perhaps a bit easier:

   2                         2

    f (x) - g(x) dx =         -x2 + 4x + 3 - (-x3 + 7x2 - 10x + 5) dx

1                         1

            2

   = x3 - 8x2 + 14x - 2 dx

                          1

   = x4 - 8x3 + 7x2 2 - 2x
                          43
                                           1

   = 16 - 64 + 28 - 4 - ( 1 - 8 + 7 - 2)
                          43               43

   = 23 - 56 - 1 = 49 .
              3 4 12

    In our first example, one curve was higher than the other over the entire interval.
This does not always happen.

Example 13.2.2 Find the area between f (x) = -x2 + 4x and g(x) = x2 - 6x + 5                  y
over the interval 0  x  1.                                                                  6

Solution The curves are shown in Figure 13.3. Generally we should interpret                           g(x )
"area" in the usual sense, as a necessarily positive quantity. Since the two                4
curves cross, we need to compute two areas and add them. First we find the
intersection point of the curves:                                                                                                          f (x)
                                                                                            2
                        -x2 + 4x = x2 - 6x + 5
                                                                                                                                   1              x
                                  0 = 2x2 - 10x + 5
                                        10 ± 100 - 40 5 ± 15                          -0.5                                 0.5                    1.5

                                  x= 4 = 2 .
                                                             

The intersection point we want is x = a = (5 - 15)/2. Then the total area is

        a                                  1                                          Figure 13.3: The area between f (x) = -x2 + 4x and

    In both of our examples above, we gave you the limits of integration by bounding  2
the x-values between 0 and 1. However, some problems are not so simple.
                                                                                                                                                       x
   Example 13.2.3 Find the area between f (x) = -x2 + 4x and g(x) = x2 - 6x + 5.

Solution The curves are shown in Figure 13.4. Here we are not given a specific              g(x )
interval, so it must be the case that there is a "natural" region involved. Since
the curves are both parabolas, the only reasonable interpretation is the region       -2

                                                                                      -4

If we let a = (5 - 15)/2 and b = (5 + 15)/2, the total area is

14 Techniques of Integration

14.1 Integration by Substitution

Computing antiderivatives is not as easy as computing derivatives. One issue is
that the chain rule can be difficult to "undo." Sometimes it is helpful to transform
the integral in question via substitution.

Theorem 14.1.1 (Integral Substitution Formula) If u(x) is differentiable               Here as is customary in calculus courses, we are
on the interval [a, b] and f (x) is differentiable on the interval [u(a), u(b)], then  abusing notation slightly, allowing u to both be a
                                                                                       name of a function u(x), and a variable in the second
  b                                       u(b)                                         integral.

   f (u(x))u(x) dx =                          f (u) du.

a                                        u(a)

Proof First we recognize the chain rule

  b                                        b

   f (u(x))u(x) dx =                       (f  u)(x) dx.

Next we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

        b                                   b

                                             u(b)

    There are several different ways to think about substitution. The first is using
the formula given above. Let's see an example.

Example 14.1.2 Compute

                          3

                           x cos(x2) dx.

                        1

Solution A little thought reveals that if x cos(x2) is the derivative of some

function, then it must have come from an application of the chain rule. Here we
have x on the "outside," which is the derivative of x2 on the "inside,"

                        x cos( x2 ) dx.

                        outside     inside                                                 Here we are directly using the equation

Set u(x) = x2 so u(x) = 2x and now it must be that f (u) = cos(u) . Now we see               b                    u(b)
                                                                                        2
                                                                                              f (u(x))u(x) dx =        f (u) du.

                                                                                           a                     u(a)

       3                             9 cos(u)
                                    1 2 du
        x cos(x2) dx =

     1

                                    sin(u) 9
                                 =

                                       21

                                 = sin(9) - sin(1) .
                                             2

    Sometimes we frame the solution in a different way. Let's do the same example
again, this time we'll think in terms of differentials.
                                                                                   calculus 221

Example 14.1.3 Compute

                          3

                           x cos(x2) dx.

                        1

Solution Here we will set u = x2. Now du = 2x dx, we are thinking in terms
of differentials. Now we see

             u(3) cos(u)       3 cos(x2) 2x dx.
            u(1) 2 du =        2
                            1

At this point, we can continue as we did before and write

               3 x cos(x2) dx = sin(9) - sin(1) .
                                          2
            1

    Finally, sometimes we simply want to deal with the antiderivative on its own,
we'll repeat the example one more time demonstrating this.

Example 14.1.4 Compute

                          3

                           x cos(x2) dx.

                        1

Solution Here we start as we did before, setting u = x2. Now du = 2x dx,
again thinking in terms of differentials. Now we see

               cos(u) du =  cos(x2) 2x dx.
                  2             2

Hence          x cos(x2) dx = sin(u) = sin(x2) .
Now we see                  2                2

               3 x cos(x2) dx = sin(x2) 3
                               21
            1

                            = sin(9) - sin(1) .
                                        2
222

   With some experience, it is not hard to see which function is f (x) and which is
u(x), let's see another example.

    Example 14.1.5 Compute

                                              x4(x5 + 1)99 dx.

Solution Here we set u = x5 + 1 so du = 5x4 dx, and f (u) = u . Now 99
                                                                                           5

     x4(x5 + 1)99 dx =                            u 99
                                                   5 du

                                         u 100
                                      = 500 .

Recalling that u = x5 + 1, we have our final answer

     x4(x5 + 1)99 dx = (x + C. 5 + 1)100
                                   500

Our next example is a bit different.

Example 14.1.6 Compute   31
                                      dx.

                        2 x ln(x)

Solution Let u = ln(x) so du = 1 dx. Write
                                               x

      31                 ln(3) 1
                 dx =             du

     2 x ln(x)          ln(2) u

                                                         ln(3)

                                     = ln(u)

                                                         ln(2)

                                     = ln(ln(3)) - ln(ln(2)).

On the other hand our next example is much harder.
                                                                                  calculus 223

Example 14.1.7 Compute

                        x3 1 - x2 dx.

Solution Here it is not apparent that the chain rule is involved. However, if it
was involved, perhaps a good guess for u would be

                                            u = 1 - x2

in this case

                        du = -2x dx.

Now consider our indefinite integral

                        x3 1 - x2 dx,

immediately we can substitute. Write               x2 u
                                 x3 1 - x2 dx =  - 2 du.

However, we cannot continue until each x is replaced. We know however that

                            u = 1 - x2
                        u - 1 = -x2
                        1 - u = x2

so now we may write                                (1 - u) u
                              x3 1 - x2 dx =     - 2 du.
224

At this point, we are close to being done. Write

       (1 - u) u     u u u                             du
     - 2 du =          2 -2                            u
                                                        2 du
            u 3/2
     = 2 du -

        u5/2 u3/2
     = 5 - 3.

Now recall that u = 1 - x2. Hence our final answer is

     x3 1 - x2 dx = (1 - x - + C. 2)5/2 (1 - x2)3/2
                  5                               3

    To summarize, if we suspect that a given function is the derivative of another
via the chain rule, we let u denote a likely candidate for the inner function, then
translate the given function so that it is written entirely in terms of u, with no x
remaining in the expression. If we can integrate this new function of u, then the
antiderivative of the original function is obtained by replacing u by the equivalent
expression in x.

14.2 Powers of Sine and Cosine

Functions consisting of products of the sine and cosine can be integrated by using
substitution and trigonometric identities. These can sometimes be tedious, but
the technique is straightforward. The basic idea in each case is to somehow take
advantage of a trigonometric identity, usually:

     cos2(x) + sin2(x) = 1,  sin2(x) = 1 - cos(2x) ,  cos2(x) = 1 + cos(2x) .
                                                  2                        2

Some examples will suffice to explain the approach.

Example 14.2.1 Compute

                                     sin5 x dx.

Solution Rewrite the function:       sin x(sin2 x)2 dx =     sin x(1 - cos2 x)2 dx.
    sin5 x dx = sin x sin4 x dx =

Now use u = cos x, du = - sin x dx:

     sin x(1 - cos2 x)2 dx = -(1 - u2)2 du

                                   = -(1 - 2u2 + u4) du

                                   = -u + 2 u3 - 1 u5 + C
                                     3           5
                                   = - cos x + 2 cos3 x - 1 cos5 x + C.
                                        3                 5

Example 14.2.2 Evaluate

                                     sin6 x dx.
                                                                              calculus 227

Solution Use sin2 x = (1 - cos(2x))/2 to rewrite the function:

sin6 x dx =  (sin2 x)3 dx =         (1 - cos 2x)3 dx
                            =1              8
                                 8
                                      1 - 3 cos 2x + 3 cos2 2x - cos3 2x dx.

Now we have four integrals to evaluate:

                                    1 dx = x

and 3
                                     -3 cos 2x dx = - 2 sin 2x

are easy. The cos3 2x integral is like the previous example:

             - cos3 2x dx = - cos 2x cos2 2x dx

                        = - cos 2x(1 - sin2 2x) dx

                        = - 1 (1 - u2) du
                                 2

                                    1     u3
                        = -2 u - 3

                        = - 1 sin 2x - sin3 2x .
                                    2            3

And finally we use another trigonometric identity, cos2 x = (1 + cos(2x))/2:

3 cos2 2x dx = 3        1 + cos 4x dx = 3 x + sin 4x .
                                       2         2              4

So at long last we get

sin6 x dx = x - 3 sin 2x - 1 sin 2x - sin3 2x + 3 x + sin 4x + C.
8 16                    16                    3     16             4
228

Example 14.2.3 Compute

                        sin2 x cos2 x dx.

Solution Use the formulas sin2 x = (1 - cos(2x))/2 and cos2 x = (1 + cos(2x))/2

to get:                                1 - cos(2x) · 1 + cos(2x) dx.

         sin2 x cos2 x dx =            2   2

The remainder is left as an exercise.

14.3 Integration by Parts

While integration by substitution allows us to identify and "undo" the chain rule,
integration by parts allows us to recognize the product rule.

Theorem 14.3.1 (Integration by Parts Formula) If f (x)g(x) is differentiable
on the interval [a, b], then

           b                      b                b

              f (x)g(x) dx = f (x)g(x) - f (x)g(x) dx.

        a                         a             a

Proof First note by the product rule we have
                             d f (x)g(x) = f (x)g(x) + f (x)g(x).
                                dx

Now integrate both sides of the equation above

        b d b f (x)g(x) dx = f (x)g(x) + f (x)g(x) dx.
        a dx
                            a

By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the left-hand side of the equation is

                                             b

                            f (x)g(x) .

However, by properties of integrals the right-hand side is equal to

                 b                b

Integration by parts is often written in a more compact form

                        u dv = uv - v du,

where u = f (x), v = g(x), du = f (x) dx and dv = g(x) dx. To use this technique we
need to identify likely candidates for u = f (x) and dv = g(x) dx.

Example 14.3.2 Compute

                        ln(x) dx.

Solution Let u = ln(x) so du = 1/x dx. Hence, dv = 1 dx so v = x and so

ln(x) dx = x ln(x) -                   x dx
                                       x

                        = x ln(x) - x + C.

Example 14.3.3 Compute

                        x sin(x) dx.

Solution Let u = x so du = dx. Hence, dv = sin(x) dx so v = - cos(x) and
                            x sin(x) dx = -x cos(x) - - cos(x) dx
                                          = -x cos(x) + cos(x) dx
                                          = -x cos(x) + sin x + C.

Example 14.3.4 Compute

                        x2 sin(x) dx.
232

Solution Let u = x2, dv = sin(x) dx; then du = 2x dx and v = - cos(x). Now
                         x2 sin(x) dx = -x2 cos(x) + 2x cos(x) dx.

This is better than the original integral, but we need to do integration by parts
again. Let u = 2x, dv = cos(x) dx; then du = 2 and v = sin(x), and

     x2 sin(x) dx = -x2 cos(x) + 2x cos(x) dx

             = -x2 cos(x) + 2x sin(x) - 2 sin(x) dx

             = -x2 cos(x) + 2x sin(x) + 2 cos(x) + C.

    Such repeated use of integration by parts is fairly common, but it can be a bit
tedious to accomplish, and it is easy to make errors, especially sign errors involving
the subtraction in the formula. There is a nice tabular method to accomplish the
calculation that minimizes the chance for error and speeds up the whole process.
We illustrate with the previous example. Here is the table:

     sign u  dv  u                             dv

     x2 sin(x)   x2 sin(x)

     - 2x - cos(x) or -2x - cos(x)

     2 - sin(x)  2 - sin(x)

     - 0 cos(x)  0 cos(x)

    To form the first table, we start with u at the top of the second column and
repeatedly compute the derivative; starting with dv at the top of the third column,
we repeatedly compute the antiderivative. In the first column, we place a "-" in every
second row. To form the second table we combine the first and second columns
by ignoring the boundary; if you do this by hand, you may simply start with two
columns and add a "-" to every second row.

    To compute with this second table we begin at the top. Multiply the first entry in
column u by the second entry in column dv to get -x2 cos(x), and add this to the
integral of the product of the second entry in column u and second entry in column
dv. This gives:

                                    -x2 cos(x) + 2x cos(x) dx,
                                                                                             calculus 233

or exactly the result of the first application of integration by parts. Since this integral
is not yet easy, we return to the table. Now we multiply twice on the diagonal,
(x2)(- cos(x)) and (-2x)(- sin(x)) and then once straight across, (2)(- sin(x)), and
combine these as

                              -x2 cos(x) + 2x sin(x) - 2 sin(x) dx,

giving the same result as the second application of integration by parts. While this
integral is easy, we may return yet once more to the table. Now multiply three
times on the diagonal to get (x2)(- cos(x)), (-2x)(- sin(x)), and (2)(cos(x)), and once
straight across, (0)(cos(x)). We combine these as before to get

  -x2 cos(x) + 2x sin(x) + 2 cos(x) + 0 dx = -x2 cos(x) + 2x sin(x) + 2 cos(x) + C.

Typically we would fill in the table one line at a time, until the "straight across"
multiplication gives an easy integral. If we can see that the u column will eventually
become zero, we can instead fill in the whole table; computing the products as
indicated will then give the entire integral, including the "+C", as above.

We have seen how to compute certain areas by using integration. We can do more,        y  10
some volumes may also be computed by evaluating an integral.
                                                                                          0 10
15.1.1 The Slab Method
Generally, the volumes that we can compute this way have cross-sections that are          -10 -5                                             0
easy to describe. Sometimes we think of these cross-sections as being "slabs" that                                    0
we are layering to create a volume.                                                                                      5                      z

    Example 15.1.1 Find the volume of a pyramid with a square base that is 20                                               10-10
    meters tall and 20 meters on a side at the base.

    Solution As with most of our applications of integration, we begin by asking       base. Here we see the thin slab used to generate the
    how we might approximate the volume. Since we can easily compute the volume        volume.
    of a box, we will use some "thin" boxes to approximate the volume of the pyramid,
    as shown in Figure 15.1.

        Centering our pyramid at the origin, each box has volume of the form

                                 width · length · height = (2x)(2x)h

    where h is understood to be a value close to zero. Write x in terms of y,
   x = 10 - y/2. If we really were adding together many small rectangles, we
236

might say xi = 10 - yi /2. In this case the total volume is approximately

                              n-1                                                                      1z

                                  4(10 - yi /2)2h.

                              i=0

This is a Riemann sum! If we take the limit as the number of slabs goes to                             0.5
infinity and the thickness of these slabs goes to zero, we obtain the following
integral:

        20                       20

As you may know, the volume of a pyramid is (1/3)(height)(area of base) =                                                 -1
(1/3)(20)(400), which agrees with our answer.                                           Figure 15.2: A plot of f (x) = x2 -1 and g(x) = -x2 +1.

Example 15.1.2 The base of a solid is the region between f (x) = x2 - 1 and
g(x) = -x2 + 1, see Figure 15.2. Its cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis

are equilateral triangles. See Figure 15.3. Find the volume of the solid.

Solution For any value of x, a cross-section is a triangle with base 2(1 - x2)             1
               2

and height 3(1 - x ), so the area of the cross-section is

        1 (base)(height) = (1 - x2) 3(1 - x2),                                          y
        2

Thus the total volume is                                                                   0 0.5

    One easy way to get "nice" cross-sections is by rotating a plane figure around a    Figure 15.3: A solid with equilateral triangle cross-
line. For example, in Figure 15.4 we see f (x) bounded by two vertical lines. Rotating  sections bounded by the region between f (x) = x2 -1
f (x) around the x-axis will generate a figure whose volume we can compute.             and g(x) = -x2 + 1.

The volume of each disk will have the form r2h. As long as we can write r in                                                                                         5

Sometimes the "slabs" look like disks with holes in them, or "washers." Let's see an  0.6                   f (x)
example of this.
                                                                                      0.4
    Example 15.1.4 Find the volume of the object generated when the area be-
   tween f (x) = x and g(x) = x2 is rotated around the x-axis, see Figure 15.6.

                                                                                      0.2                   g(x )

Solution This solid has a "hole" in the middle. We can compute the volume by                  0.2     0.4          0.6                 0.8      1  x
subtracting the volume of the hole from the volume enclosed by the outer surface
of the solid. In Figure 15.7 we show the region that is rotated, the resulting        Figure 15.6: A plot of f (x) = x and g(x) = x2.
solid with the front half cut away, the cone that forms the outer surface, the
horn-shaped hole, and a cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis.                         1

    We can compute the desired volume "all at once" by approximating the volume
of the actual solid. We can approximate the volume of a slice of the solid with a
washer-shaped volume, as indicated in Figure 15.7. The area of the face is the
area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner circle, say

                                            R2 - r2.

In the present example, we have                                                       y    0
                                            x2 - x4.

15.1.3 The Shell Method                                                                       y

Suppose the region between f (x) = x + 1 and g(x) = (x - 1)2 is rotated around the

y-axis. It is possible, but inconvenient, to compute the volume of the resulting solid

by the method we have used so far. The problem is that there are two "kinds" of             3

typical rectangles: those that go from the line to the parabola and those that touch

the parabola on both ends, see Figure 15.8. To compute the volume using this                2

approach, we need to break the problem into two parts and compute two integrals:                 f (x)                                  g(x )

1  (1 + y)2 - (1 - y)2 4 dy +  (1 + y)2 - (y - 1)2 dy = 8  + 65  = 27 .
                                                   36                   2

If instead we consider a typical vertical rectangle, but still rotate around the

y-axis, we get a thin "shell" instead of a thin "washer," see Figure 15.9. If we add

up the volume of such thin shells we will get an approximation to the true volume.                      1                     2                       3  x

What is the volume of such a shell? Consider the shell at x. Imagine that we cut

the shell vertically in one place and "unroll" it into a thin, flat sheet. This sheet will              1                     2                       3  x

unrolled. We may now write the integral                                                     Figure 15.9: A plot of f (x) = x + 1 and g(x) = (x - 1)2

Not only does this accomplish the task with only one integral, the integral is

somewhat easier than those in the previous calculation. Things are not always so
240

neat, but it is often the case that one of the two methods will be simpler than the
other, so it is worth considering both before starting to do calculations.

15.2 Arc Length                                                                            y

Here is another geometric application of the integral, finding the length of a portion                       (x1 - x0)2 + (y1 - y0)2     (x1, y1)
of a curve. As usual, we need to think about how we might approximate the length,                                (x0, y0)
and turn the approximation into an integral.
                                                                                                                                                                                x
    We already know how to compute one simple arc length, that of a line segment. If       Figure 15.10: The length of a line segment.
the endpoints are (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) then the length of the segment is the distance
between the points, (x1 - x0)2 + (y1 - y0)2, see Figure 15.10.                                                                                 y

   Now if f (x) is "nice" (say, differentiable) it appears that we can approximate the                                                      4
length of a portion of the curve with line segments, and that as the number of
segments increases, and their lengths decrease, the sum of the lengths of the line
segments will approach the true arc length, see Figure 15.11.

    Now we need to write a formula for the sum of the lengths of the line segments, in
a form that we know becomes an integral in the limit. So we suppose we have divided
the interval [a, b] into n subintervals as usual, each with length h = (b - a)/n, and
endpoints

                                      a = x0, x1, x2, . . . , xn = b.

The length of a typical line segment, joining (xi , f (xi )) to (xi+1, f (xi+1)), is

                 h2 + (f (xi+1) - f (xi ))2.                                                       f (x)  2

By the Mean Value Theorem, Theorem 10.3.3, there is a number ci in (xi , xi+1) such                                                                   x

that                                                                                       -3  -2  -1                                 1            2

                 f (ci ) = f (xi+1) - f (xi ) = f (xi+1) - f (xi ) .
                 xi+1 - xi  h                                                                             -2

so f (ci )h = f (xi+1) - f (xi ). Hence, the length of the line segment can be written as

                 h2 + (f (ci ))2h2 = h 1 + (f (ci ))2.                                                                               -4

The arc length is then                                                                     Figure 15.11: Approximating the arc length of the

                                                                 n-1

                                        lim h 1 + (f (ci ))2

                                                         n i=0

This is a Riemann sum! Now we may take the limit as the number of xi 's chosen
goes to infinity and h goes to zero to obtain the integral

                                                                      b

                                                 1 + (f (x))2 dx.

                                                                    a
                                                                                            calculus 243

Note that the sum looks a bit different than others we have encountered, because

the approximation contains a ci instead of an xi . In the past we have always used

left endpoints (namely, xi ) to get a representative value of f on [xi , xi+1]; now we are

using a different point, but the principle is the same.

To summarize, to compute the length of a curve on the interval [a, b], we compute

the integral

                                        b

                                           1 + (f (x))2 dx.

                                      a

Unfortunately, integrals of this form are typically difficult or impossible to compute

exactly, because usually none of our methods for finding antiderivatives will work.

In practice this means that the integral will usually have to be approximated.

                                      
Example 15.2.1 Let f (x) = r2 - x2, the upper half circle of radius r. The
length of this curve is half the circumference, namely r. Let's compute this

                                                                    
with the arc length formula. The derivative f  is -x/ r2 - x2 so the integral is

              r x2 r                        r2               r    1
                  1 + 2 2 dx =                                  2 2 dx.
                  r -x                      2 2 dx = r       -r r - x
              -r                      -r r - x

Using a trigonometric substitution, we find the antiderivative, namely arcsin(x/r).
Notice that the integral is improper at both endpoints, as the function 1/(r2 - x2)
is undefined when x = ±r. So we need to compute

                                   0  1D                         1 dx.
                                      2 2 dx + lim-          r2 - x2
                   lim                r -x  Dr 0

                  D-r+ D

This is not difficult, and has value , so the original integral, with the extra r
in front, has value r as expected.

1. -1(t) = 3t - 3, this function gives the number of months required to grow hair to a given

1. For these problems, there are many possible values of , so we provide an inequality
that  must satisfy when  = 0.1. (a)  < 1/30, (b)  < 110 - 1  0.0488, (c)  <
                                                        10

Let  > 0. Set  = . If 0 < |x - 0| < , then |x · 1| < , since sin 1  1, |x sin 1 - 0| < .
                                                        x             x
3. Let  > 0. Set  = /2. If 0 < |x - 4| < , then |2x - 8| < 2 = , and then because

|2x - 8| = |(2x - 5) - 3|, we conclude |(2x - 5) - 3| < . 4. Let  > 0. Set  = /4. If

0 < |x - (-3)| < , then | - 4x - 12| < 4 = , and then because | - 4x - 12| = |(-4x - 11) - 1|,

we conclude |(-4x - 11) - 1| < . 5. Let  > 0. No matter what I choose for , if x is within
 of -2, then  is within  of . 6. As long as x -2, we have x2 - 4 = x - 2, and the limit

                                                                                      x +2
is not sensitive to the value of the function at the point -2; the limit only depends on nearby

values, so we really want to compute lim (x -2). Let  > 0. Set  = . Then if 0 < |x -(-2)| < ,
                                                     x-2 

we have |(x - 2) - (-4)| < . 7. Let  > 0. Pick  so that  < 1 and  < 61 . Suppose
0 < |x - 4| < . Then 4 -  < x < 4 + . Cube to get (4 - )3 < x3 < (4 + )3. Expanding the

right-side inequality, we get x3 < 3 + 12 · 2 + 48 ·  + 64 <  + 12 + 48 + 64 = 64 + .

The other inequality is similar. 8. Let  > 0. Pick  small enough so that  < /6 and

 < 1. Assume |x - 1| < , so 6 · |x - 1| < . Since x is within  < 1 of 1, we know 0 < x < 2.

So |x + 4| < 6. Putting it together, |x + 4| · |x - 1| < , so |x2 + 3x - 4| < , and therefore

|(x2 + 3x - 1) - 3| < . 9. Let  > 0. Set  = 3. Assume 0 < |x - 9| < . Divide both sides
             |x - 9|               |x - 9|
by 3 to get           < . Note that x + 3 > 3, so       < . This can be rearranged to
             3                                    x +3

             x -9     - 6 < .  10. Let  > 0. Set  to be the minimum of 2 and 1. Assume
conclude 
             x -3
x is within  of 2, so |x - 2| < 2 and 1 < x < 3. So x - 2 < . Since 1 < x < 3, we also have
                                   2
2x > 2, so x - 2 < . Simplifying, 1 - 1 < , which is what we wanted.

Answers for 4.2

1. min at x = 1/2 2. min at x = -1, max at x = 1 3. max at x = 2, min at x = 4 4.
min at x = ±1, max at x = 0. 5. min at x = 1 6. none 7. max at x = 0, min at
x = ±11 8. f (x) = 2ax + b, this has only one root and hence one critical point; a < 0 to
guarantee a maximum.
