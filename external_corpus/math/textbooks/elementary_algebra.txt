About Elementary Algebra

Elementary Algebra 2e is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of a one-semester elementary algebra
course. The book's organization makes it easy to adapt to a variety of course syllabi. The text expands on the
fundamental concepts of algebra while addressing the needs of students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles.
Each topic builds upon previously developed material to demonstrate the cohesiveness and structure of mathematics.

Coverage and Scope

Elementary Algebra 2e follows a nontraditional approach in its presentation of content. Building on the content in
Prealgebra, the material is presented as a sequence of small steps so that students gain confidence in their ability to
succeed in the course. The order of topics was carefully planned to emphasize the logical progression through the
course and to facilitate a thorough understanding of each concept. As new ideas are presented, they are explicitly
related to previous topics.

      Chapter 1: Foundations
      Chapter 1 reviews arithmetic operations with whole numbers, integers, fractions, and decimals, to give the student
      a solid base that will support their study of algebra.
      Chapter 2: Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities
2 Preface

           In Chapter 2, students learn to verify a solution of an equation, solve equations using the Subtraction and Addition
           Properties of Equality, solve equations using the Multiplication and Division Properties of Equality, solve equations
           with variables and constants on both sides, use a general strategy to solve linear equations, solve equations with
           fractions or decimals, solve a formula for a specific variable, and solve linear inequalities.
           Chapter 3: Math Models
           Once students have learned the skills needed to solve equations, they apply these skills in Chapter 3 to solve word
           and number problems.
           Chapter 4: Graphs
           Chapter 4 covers the rectangular coordinate system, which is the basis for most consumer graphs. Students learn to
           plot points on a rectangular coordinate system, graph linear equations in two variables, graph with intercepts,
           understand slope of a line, use the slope-intercept form of an equation of a line, find the equation of a line, and
           create graphs of linear inequalities.
           Chapter 5: Systems of Linear Equations
           Chapter 5 covers solving systems of equations by graphing, substitution, and elimination; solving applications with
           systems of equations, solving mixture applications with systems of equations, and graphing systems of linear
           inequalities.
           Chapter 6: Polynomials
           In Chapter 6, students learn how to add and subtract polynomials, use multiplication properties of exponents,
           multiply polynomials, use special products, divide monomials and polynomials, and understand integer exponents
           and scientific notation.
           Chapter 7: Factoring
           In Chapter 7, students explore the process of factoring expressions and see how factoring is used to solve certain
           types of equations.
           Chapter 8: Rational Expressions and Equations
           In Chapter 8, students work with rational expressions, solve rational equations, and use them to solve problems in a
           variety of applications.
           Chapter 9: Roots and Radical
           In Chapter 9, students are introduced to and learn to apply the properties of square roots, and extend these
           concepts to higher order roots and rational exponents.
           Chapter 10: Quadratic Equations
           In Chapter 10, students study the properties of quadratic equations, solve and graph them. They also learn how to
           apply them as models of various situations.

    All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.

   Changes to the Second Edition

    The Elementary Algebra 2e revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy. Every Example, Try-It, Section
    Exercise, Review Exercise, and Practice Test item was reviewed by multiple faculty experts, and then verified by authors.
    This intensive effort resulted in hundreds of changes to the text, problem language, answers, instructor solutions, and
    graphics.

    However, OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when
    textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized
    any shifting of exercise numbers. For example, instead of deleting or adding problems where necessary, we replaced
    problems in order to keep the numbering intact. As a result, in nearly all chapters, there will be no shifting of exercise
    numbers; in the chapters where shifting does occur, it will be minor. Faculty and course coordinators should be able to
    use the new edition in a straightforward manner.

    Also, to increase convenience, answers to the Be Prepared Exercises will now appear in the regular solutions manuals,
    rather than as a separate resource.

    A detailed transition guide is available as an instructor resource at openstax.org.

   Key Features and Boxes

    Examples
    Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving
    approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective to model
    different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.

    All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the
    solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we show students how to check the solution.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   Preface 3

Most Examples are written in a two-column format, with explanation on the left and math on the right to mimic the way
that instructors "talk through" examples as they write on the board in class.
Be Prepared!
Each section, beginning with Section 2.1, starts with a few "Be Prepared!" exercises so that students can determine if they
have mastered the prerequisite skills for the section. Reference is made to specific Examples from previous sections so
students who need further review can easily find explanations. Answers to these exercises can be found in the
supplemental resources that accompany this title.
Try It

A "Try It" exercise immediately follows an Example, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a
similar problem. In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the
Answer Key.
How To

How To feature typically follows the Try It exercises and outlines the series of steps for how to solve the problem in the
preceding Example.
Media

The "Media" icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of
links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.
Disclaimer: While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these
tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany Prealgebra 2e.
Self Check The Self Check includes the learning objectives for the section so that students can self-assess their mastery
and make concrete plans to improve.

Art Program

Elementary Algebra 2e contains many figures and illustrations. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated
style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions.

Section Exercises

Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used
selectively for guided practice. Exercise sets are named Practice Makes Perfect to encourage completion of homework
assignments.

  · Exercises correlate to the learning objectives. This facilitates assignment of personalized study plans based on
      individual student needs.

  · Exercises are carefully sequenced to promote building of skills.
  · Values for constants and coefficients were chosen to practice and reinforce arithmetic facts.
  · Even and odd-numbered exercises are paired.
  · Exercises parallel and extend the text examples and use the same instructions as the examples to help students

      easily recognize the connection.
  · Applications are drawn from many everyday experiences, as well as those traditionally found in college math texts.
4 Preface

       · Everyday Math highlights practical situations using the concepts from that particular section
       · Writing Exercises are included in every exercise set to encourage conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and

           literacy.

   Chapter Review Features

    Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that
    students can use to prepare for exams.

       · Key Terms provide a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter.
       · Key Concepts summarize the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant

           Example(s) in case students need to review.
       · Chapter Review Exercises include practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each section.
       · Practice Test includes additional problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter.

      Introduction

Just like a building needs a firm foundation to support it, your study of algebra needs to have a firm foundation. To
ensure this, we begin this book with a review of arithmetic operations with whole numbers, integers, fractions, and
decimals, so that you have a solid base that will support your study of algebra.

1.1 Introduction to Whole Numbers

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
           Use place value with whole numbers
           Identify multiples and apply divisibility tests
           Find prime factorizations and least common multiples

   BE PREPARED 1.1  A more thorough introduction to the topics covered in this section can be found in
                    Prealgebra in the chapters Whole Numbers and The Language of Algebra.

As we begin our study of elementary algebra, we need to refresh some of our skills and vocabulary. This chapter will
focus on whole numbers, integers, fractions, decimals, and real numbers. We will also begin our use of algebraic
notation and vocabulary.

   Use Place Value with Whole Numbers

    The most basic numbers used in algebra are the numbers we use to count objects in our world: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.
    These are called the counting numbers. Counting numbers are also called natural numbers. If we add zero to the
    counting numbers, we get the set of whole numbers.

         Counting Numbers: 1, 2, 3, ...
         Whole Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
    The notation "..." is called ellipsis and means "and so on," or that the pattern continues endlessly.
    We can visualize counting numbers and whole numbers on a number line (see Figure 1.2).

    Figure 1.2 The numbers on the number line get larger as they go from left to right, and smaller as they go from right to
    left. While this number line shows only the whole numbers 0 through 6, the numbers keep going without end.

               MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

      Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Number Line-Part 1" will help you develop a better understanding of
      the counting numbers and the whole numbers.

    Our number system is called a place value system, because the value of a digit depends on its position in a number.
    Figure 1.3 shows the place values. The place values are separated into groups of three, which are called periods. The
    periods are ones, thousands, millions, billions, trillions, and so on. In a written number, commas separate the periods.

Figure 1.3 The number 5,278,194 is shown in the chart. The digit 5 is in the millions place. The digit 2 is in the hundred-
thousands place. The digit 7 is in the ten-thousands place. The digit 8 is in the thousands place. The digit 1 is in the
hundreds place. The digit 9 is in the tens place. The digit 4 is in the ones place.

EXAMPLE 1.1

In the number 63,407,218, find the place value of each digit:

7 0            1                 6  3

When you write a check, you write out the number in words as well as in digits. To write a number in words, write the
number in each period, followed by the name of the period, without the s at the end. Start at the left, where the periods
have the largest value. The ones period is not named. The commas separate the periods, so wherever there is a comma
in the number, put a comma between the words (see Figure 1.4). The number 74,218,369 is written as seventy-four
million, two hundred eighteen thousand, three hundred sixty-nine.

     HOW TO

Name a Whole Number in Words.

Step 1. Start at the left and name the number in each period, followed by the period name.
Step 2. Put commas in the number to separate the periods.
Step 3. Do not name the ones period.

  EXAMPLE 1.2

Name the number 8,165,432,098,710 using words.
     Solution

Name the number in each period, followed by the period name.

     TRY IT 1.4 Name the number             using words.

We are now going to reverse the process by writing the digits from the name of the number. To write the number in
digits, we first look for the clue words that indicate the periods. It is helpful to draw three blanks for the needed periods
and then fill in the blanks with the numbers, separating the periods with commas.

                 HOW TO

  Write a Whole Number Using Digits.

  Step 1. Identify the words that indicate periods. (Remember, the ones period is never named.)
  Step 2. Draw three blanks to indicate the number of places needed in each period. Separate the periods by commas.
  Step 3. Name the number in each period and place the digits in the correct place value position.

  EXAMPLE 1.3

Write nine billion, two hundred forty-six million, seventy-three thousand, one hundred eighty-nine as a whole number
using digits.

     Solution
Identify the words that indicate periods.
Except for the first period, all other periods must have three places. Draw three blanks to indicate the number of places
needed in each period. Separate the periods by commas.
Then write the digits in each period.

In 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population of the state of New York as 19,651,127. We could say the
population of New York was approximately 20 million. In many cases, you don't need the exact value; an approximate
number is good enough.

The process of approximating a number is called rounding. Numbers are rounded to a specific place value, depending
on how much accuracy is needed. Saying that the population of New York is approximately 20 million means that we
rounded to the millions place.

used symbols are a, b, c, m, n, x, and y. Further discussion of constants and variables appears later in this section.

Identify Multiples and Apply Divisibility Tests

The numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are called multiples of 2. A multiple of 2 can be written as the product of 2 and a
counting number.

Similarly, a multiple of 3 would be the product of a counting number and 3.

We could find the multiples of any number by continuing this process.

Multiple of a Number
A number is a multiple of n if it is the product of a counting number and n.

Another way to say that 15 is a multiple of 3 is to say that 15 is divisible by 3. That means that when we divide 15 by 3,

we get a counting number. In fact,   is 5, so 15 is

Divisible by a Number

If a number m is a multiple of n, then m is divisible by n.

Look at the multiples of 5 in Table 1.1. They all end in 5 or 0. Numbers with last digit of 5 or 0 are divisible by 5. Looking
for other patterns in Table 1.1 that shows multiples of the numbers 2 through 9, we can discover the following divisibility
tests:

Find Prime Factorizations and Least Common Multiples

In mathematics, there are often several ways to talk about the same ideas. So far, we've seen that if m is a multiple of n,
we can say that m is divisible by n. For example, since 72 is a multiple of 8, we say 72 is divisible by 8. Since 72 is a
multiple of 9, we say 72 is divisible by 9. We can express this still another way.

Since    we say that 8 and 9 are factors of 72. When we write  we say we have factored 72.

Other ways to factor 72 are                               Seventy-two has many factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18,

  understanding of multiplication and factoring.

Prime Number and Composite Number

A prime number is a counting number greater than 1, whose only factors are 1 and itself.
A composite number is a counting number that is not prime. A composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.

     The prime numbers less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Notice that the only even prime number is 2.
     A composite number can be written as a unique product of primes. This is called the prime factorization of the number.
     Finding the prime factorization of a composite number will be useful later in this course.

       Prime Factorization
       The prime factorization of a number is the product of prime numbers that equals the number. These prime numbers
       are called the prime factors.
     To find the prime factorization of a composite number, find any two factors of the number and use them to create two
     branches. If a factor is prime, that branch is complete. Circle that prime!
     If the factor is not prime, find two factors of the number and continue the process. Once all the branches have circled
     primes at the end, the factorization is complete. The composite number can now be written as a product of prime
     numbers.

     One of the reasons we look at multiples and primes is to use these techniques to find the least common multiple of
     two numbers. This will be useful when we add and subtract fractions with different denominators. Two methods are
     used most often to find the least common multiple and we will look at both of them.
     The first method is the Listing Multiples Method. To find the least common multiple of 12 and 18, we list the first few
     multiples of 12 and 18:

     Notice that some numbers appear in both lists. They are the common multiples of 12 and 18.
     We see that the first few common multiples of 12 and 18 are 36, 72, and 108. Since 36 is the smallest of the common
     multiples, we call it the least common multiple. We often use the abbreviation LCM.

       Least Common Multiple
       The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.

     The procedure box lists the steps to take to find the LCM using the prime factors method we used above for 12 and 18.

                    ...

                      HOW TO
       Find the Least Common Multiple by Listing Multiples.
       Step 1. List several multiples of each number.
       Step 2. Look for the smallest number that appears on both lists.
       Step 3. This number is the LCM.

Our second method to find the least common multiple of two numbers is to use The Prime Factors Method. Let's find the
LCM of 12 and 18 again, this time using their prime factors.

  EXAMPLE 1.10
How to Find the Least Common Multiple Using the Prime Factors Method

     Solution

Notice that the prime factors of 12  and the prime factors of 18     are included in the LCM

So 36 is the least common multiple of 12 and 18.

By matching up the common primes, each common prime factor is used only once. This way you are sure that 36 is the
least common multiple.

Self Check

 After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section.

 If most of your checks were:

...confidently. Congratulations! You have achieved the objectives in this section. Reflect on the study skills you used so
that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific.

...with some help. This must be addressed quickly because topics you do not master become potholes in your road to
success. In math, every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation
before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a
place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved?

...no--I don't get it! This is a warning sign and you must not ignore it. You should get help right away or you will quickly
be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as you can to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan
to get you the help you need.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
           Use variables and algebraic symbols
           Simplify expressions using the order of operations
           Evaluate an expression
           Identify and combine like terms
           Translate an English phrase to an algebraic expression

BE PREPARED 1.2                A more thorough introduction to the topics covered in this section can be found in the
                               Prealgebra chapter, The Language of Algebra.

Use Variables and Algebraic Symbols

Suppose this year Greg is 20 years old and Alex is 23. You know that Alex is 3 years older than Greg. When Greg was 12,
Alex was 15. When Greg is 35, Alex will be 38. No matter what Greg's age is, Alex's age will always be 3 years more, right?
In the language of algebra, we say that Greg's age and Alex's age are variables and the 3 is a constant. The ages change
("vary") but the 3 years between them always stays the same ("constant"). Since Greg's age and Alex's age will always
differ by 3 years, 3 is the constant.

In algebra, we use letters of the alphabet to represent variables. So if we call Greg's age g, then we could use  to

represent Alex's age. See Table 1.2.

                                      Greg's age Alex's age

                                      Table 1.2
24 1 · Foundations

                                          Greg's age Alex's age

                                                                  Table 1.2
The letters used to represent these changing ages are called variables. The letters most commonly used for variables are
x, y, a, b, and c.

  Variable

  A variable is a letter that represents a number whose value may change.

Constant
A constant is a number whose value always stays the same.

To write algebraically, we need some operation symbols as well as numbers and variables. There are several types of
symbols we will be using.

There are four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll list the symbols used
to indicate these operations in the table below. You'll probably recognize some of them.

Operation           Notation              Say:                              The result is...

Addition                                  a plus b   the sum of a and b

Subtraction                               a minus b the difference of a and b

Multiplication                            a times b the product of a and b

Division                                  a divided  the quotient of a and b, a is called the dividend, and b is
                                          by b       called the divisor

We perform these operations on two numbers. When translating from symbolic form to English, or from English to
symbolic form, pay attention to the words "of" and "and."

· The difference of 9 and 2 means subtract 9 and 2, in other words, 9 minus 2, which we write symbolically as
· The product of 4 and 8 means multiply 4 and 8, in other words 4 times 8, which we write symbolically as

In algebra, the cross symbol, is not used to show multiplication because that symbol may cause confusion. Does 3xy

mean                (`three times y') or  (three times x times y)? To make it clear, use or parentheses for multiplication.

When two quantities have the same value, we say they are equal and connect them with an equal sign.
  Equality Symbol
          is read "a is equal to b"
  The symbol is called the equal sign.

On the number line, the numbers get larger as they go from left to right. The number line can be used to explain the
symbols "<" and ">."

  Inequality

The expressions a < b or a > b can be read from left to right or right to left, though in English we usually read from left to
right (Table 1.3). In general, a < b is equivalent to b > a. For example 7 < 11 is equivalent to 11 > 7. And a > b is equivalent
to b < a. For example 17 > 4 is equivalent to 4 < 17.

Grouping symbols in algebra are much like the commas, colons, and other punctuation marks in English. They help to
make clear which expressions are to be kept together and separate from other expressions. We will introduce three
types now.

Grouping Symbols

Here are some examples of expressions that include grouping symbols. We will simplify expressions like these later in
this section.

What is the difference in English between a phrase and a sentence? A phrase expresses a single thought that is
incomplete by itself, but a sentence makes a complete statement. "Running very fast" is a phrase, but "The football
player was running very fast" is a sentence. A sentence has a subject and a verb. In algebra, we have expressions and
equations.

  Expression

  An expression is a number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables using operation symbols.

An expression is like an English phrase. Here are some examples of expressions:

                                 Expression  Words       English Phrase

                                             3 plus 5    the sum of three and five

                                             n minus one the difference of n and one

                                             6 times 7   the product of six and seven

                                             x divided by y the quotient of x and y

Notice that the English phrases do not form a complete sentence because the phrase does not have a verb.
An equation is two expressions linked with an equal sign. When you read the words the symbols represent in an
equation, you have a complete sentence in English. The equal sign gives the verb.

  Equation
  An equation is two expressions connected by an equal sign.

Here are some examples of equations.

Simplify Expressions Using the Order of Operations

To simplify an expression means to do all the math possible. For example, to simplify  we'd first multiply to

get 8 and then add the 1 to get 9. A good habit to develop is to work down the page, writing each step of the process

below the previous step. The example just described would look like this:

By not using an equal sign when you simplify an expression, you may avoid confusing expressions with equations.

  Simplify an Expression
  To simplify an expression, do all operations in the expression.

We've introduced most of the symbols and notation used in algebra, but now we need to clarify the order of operations.
Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in different values. For example, consider the
expression:

If you simplify this expression, what do you get?
Some students say 49,

Others say 25,

Imagine the confusion in our banking system if every problem had several different correct answers!
The same expression should give the same result. So mathematicians early on established some guidelines that are
called the Order of Operations.

             ...

                 HOW TO

  Perform the Order of Operations.
  Step 1. Parentheses and Other Grouping Symbols

                Simplify all expressions inside the parentheses or other grouping symbols, working on the innermost
                    parentheses first.

  Step 2. Exponents
                Simplify all expressions with exponents.

  Step 3. Multiplication and Division
                Perform all multiplication and division in order from left to right. These operations have equal priority.

  Step 4. Addition and Subtraction
                Perform all addition and subtraction in order from left to right. These operations have equal priority.

          MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

  Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Game of 24" give you practice using the order of operations.

Students often ask, "How will I remember the order?" Here is a way to help you remember: Take the first letter of each
key word and substitute the silly phrase: "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally."
30 1 · Foundations

It's good that "My Dear" goes together, as this reminds us that multiplication and division have equal priority. We do not
always do multiplication before division or always do division before multiplication. We do them in order from left to
right.

Similarly, "Aunt Sally" goes together and so reminds us that addition and subtraction also have equal priority and we do
them in order from left to right.

Let's try an example.

Identify and Combine Like Terms

Algebraic expressions are made up of terms. A term is a constant, or the product of a constant and one or more
variables.

  Term

  A term is a constant, or the product of a constant and one or more variables.

Examples of terms are
The constant that multiplies the variable is called the coefficient.

Coefficient
The coefficient of a term is the constant that multiplies the variable in a term.

Think of the coefficient as the number in front of the variable. The coefficient of the term 3x is 3. When we write x, the
coefficient is 1, since

EXAMPLE 1.21

Identify the coefficient of each term:   14y    a.

Use Negatives and Opposites

Our work so far has only included the counting numbers and the whole numbers. But if you have ever experienced a
temperature below zero or accidentally overdrawn your checking account, you are already familiar with negative
numbers. Negative numbers are numbers less than The negative numbers are to the left of zero on the number line.
See Figure 1.6.

The arrows on the ends of the number line indicate that the numbers keep going forever. There is no biggest positive
number, and there is no smallest negative number.
Is zero a positive or a negative number? Numbers larger than zero are positive, and numbers smaller than zero are
negative. Zero is neither positive nor negative.
Consider how numbers are ordered on the number line. Going from left to right, the numbers increase in value. Going
from right to left, the numbers decrease in value. See Figure 1.7.

Figure 1.7 The numbers on a number line increase in value going from left to right and decrease in value going from
right to left.

          MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

  Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Number Line-part 2" will help you develop a better understanding of
  integers.

Remember that we use the notation:
a < b (read "a is less than b") when a is to the left of b on the number line.
a > b (read "a is greater than b") when a is to the right of b on the number line.
Now we need to extend the number line which showed the whole numbers to include negative numbers, too. The
numbers marked by points in Figure 1.8 are called the integers. The integers are the numbers

You may have noticed that, on the number line, the negative numbers are a mirror image of the positive numbers, with
zero in the middle. Because the numbers 2 and are the same distance from zero, they are called opposites. The
opposite of 2 is and the opposite of is 2.

Opposite

The opposite of a number is the number that is the same distance from zero on the number line but on the opposite
side of zero.

Sometimes in algebra the same symbol has different meanings. Just like some words in English, the specific meaning
becomes clear by looking at how it is used. You have seen the symbol "-" used in three different ways.

                                 Between two numbers, it indicates the operation of subtraction.

                                                 We read  as "10 minus 4."

                                        In front of a number, it indicates a negative number.
                                                      We read -8 as "negative eight."

                    In front of a variable, it indicates the opposite. We read as "the opposite of ."

           Here there are two "-" signs. The one in the parentheses tells us the number is negative 2. The one outside

                                        the parentheses tells us to take the opposite of -2.

Simplify: Expressions with Absolute Value

We saw that numbers such as         are opposites because they are the same distance from 0 on the number line.

They are both two units from 0. The distance between 0 and any number on the number line is called the absolute

value of that number.

Absolute Value

The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line.
The absolute value of a number n is written as

Add Integers

Most students are comfortable with the addition and subtraction facts for positive numbers. But doing addition or
subtraction with both positive and negative numbers may be more challenging.

          MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

  Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Addition of Signed Numbers" will help you develop a better
  understanding of adding integers."

We will use two color counters to model addition and subtraction of negatives so that you can visualize the procedures
instead of memorizing the rules.
We let one color (blue) represent positive. The other color (red) will represent the negatives. If we have one positive
counter and one negative counter, the value of the pair is zero. They form a neutral pair. The value of this neutral pair is
zero.

We will use the counters to show how to add the four addition facts using the numbers  and

We start with 5 positives.

And then we add 3 positives.

In what ways were these first two examples similar?
  · The first example adds 5 positives and 3 positives--both positives.
  · The second example adds 5 negatives and 3 negatives--both negatives.

In each case we got 8--either 8 positives or 8 negatives.
When the signs were the same, the counters were all the same color, and so we added them.

EXAMPLE 1.37

Add:        

  Solution



  1 positive plus 4 positives is 5 positives.



1 negative plus 4 negatives is 5 negatives.

So what happens when the signs are different? Let's add  We realize this means the sum of and 3. When the

counters were the same color, we put them in a row. When the counters are a different color, we line them up under each

other.

                              -5 + 3 means the sum of -5 and 3.

We start with 5 negatives.

And then we add 3 positives.
52 1 · Foundations

We remove any neutral pairs.

We have 2 negatives left.

The sum of -5 and 3 is -2.       -5 + 3 = -2

Notice that there were more negatives than positives, so the result was negative.
Let's now add the last combination,

                                                 5 + (-3) means the sum of 5 and -3.

  We start with 5 positives.

And then we add 3 negatives.

We remove any neutral pairs.

We have 2 positives left.

The sum of 5 and -3 is 2.        5 + (-3) = 2

When we use counters to model addition of positive and negative integers, it is easy to see whether there are more
positive or more negative counters. So we know whether the sum will be positive or negative.

Now that we have added small positive and negative integers with a model, we can visualize the model in our minds to
simplify problems with any numbers.

When you need to add numbers such as                 you really don't want to have to count out 37 blue counters and 53

red counters. With the model in your mind, can you visualize what you would do to solve the problem?

Picture 37 blue counters with 53 red counters lined up underneath. Since there would be more red (negative) counters
than blue (positive) counters, the sum would be negative. How many more red counters would there be? Because

                    there are 16 more red counters.

Therefore, the sum of  is

Let's try another one. We'll add            Again, imagine 74 red counters and 27 more red counters, so we'd have
101 red counters. This means the sum is

Let's look again at the results of adding the different combinations of  and

Addition of Positive and Negative Integers

When the signs are the same, the counters would be all the same color, so add them.

When the signs are different, some of the counters would make neutral pairs, so subtract to see how many are left.

Visualize the model as you simplify the expressions in the following examples.

EXAMPLE 1.39

Solution

 Since the signs are different, we subtract    The answer will be negative because there are more

negatives than positives.

 Since the signs are the same, we add. The answer will be negative because there are only negatives.

We will continue to use counters to model the subtraction. Remember, the blue counters represent positive numbers
and the red counters represent negative numbers.

Perhaps when you were younger, you read     as take away When you use counters, you can think of
subtraction the same way!

We will model the four subtraction facts using the numbers and

To subtract   we restate the problem as take away

We start with 5 positives.

We `take away' 3 positives.

We have 2 positives left.

The difference of 5 and 3 is 2.          2

Now we will subtract               Watch for similarities to the last example
To subtract           we restate this as take away

We start with 5 negatives.

We `take away' 3 negatives.

We have 2 negatives left.

The difference of -5 and -3 is -2.          -2

Notice that these two examples are much alike: The first example, we subtract 3 positives from 5 positives and end up
with 2 positives.

In the second example, we subtract 3 negatives from 5 negatives and end up with 2 negatives.

Each example used counters of only one color, and the "take away" model of subtraction was easy to apply.

What happens when we have to subtract one positive and one negative number? We'll need to use both blue and red
counters as well as some neutral pairs. Adding a neutral pair does not change the value. It is like changing quarters to
nickels--the value is the same, but it looks different.

· To subtract  we restate it as take away 3.

We start with 5 negatives. We need to take away 3 positives, but we do not have any positives to take away.

Remember, a neutral pair has value zero. If we add 0 to 5 its value is still 5. We add neutral pairs to the 5 negatives until
we get 3 positives to take away.

                                                    -5 - 3 means -5 take away 3.

We start with 5 negatives.

We now add the neutrals needed to get 3 positives.

We remove the 3 positives.

We are left with 8 negatives.

The difference of -5 and 3 is -8.                   -5 - 3 = -8

And now, the fourth case,          We start with 5 positives. We need to take away 3 negatives, but there are no

negatives to take away. So we add neutral pairs until we have 3 negatives to take away.

                                   5 - (-3) means 5 take away -3.

We start with 5 positives.

We now add the needed neutrals pairs.

                                 Prealgebra chapter, Integers.

Multiply Integers

Since multiplication is mathematical shorthand for repeated addition, our model can easily be applied to show
multiplication of integers. Let's look at this concrete model to see what patterns we notice. We will use the same
examples that we used for addition and subtraction. Here, we will use the model just to help us discover the pattern.

We remember that means add a, b times.

The next two examples are more interesting.

What does it mean to multiply 5 by It means subtract 5, 3 times. Looking at subtraction as "taking away," it means to
take away 5, 3 times. But there is nothing to take away, so we start by adding neutral pairs on the workspace. Then we
take away 5 three times.

In summary:

Notice that for multiplication of two signed numbers, when the:
  · signs are the same, the product is positive.
  · signs are different, the product is negative.

We'll put this all together in the chart below.

What about division? Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. So,          because  In words, this

expression says that 15 can be divided into three groups of five each because adding five three times gives 15. Look at

some examples of multiplying integers, to figure out the rules for dividing integers.

Division follows the same rules as multiplication!
For division of two signed numbers, when the:

  · signs are the same, the quotient is positive.
  · signs are different, the quotient is negative.
And remember that we can always check the answer of a division problem by multiplying.

We'll outline a plan to solve applications. It's hard to find something if we don't know what we're looking for or what to
call it! So when we solve an application, we first need to determine what the problem is asking us to find. Then we'll write
a phrase that gives the information to find it. We'll translate the phrase into an expression and then simplify the
expression to get the answer. Finally, we summarize the answer in a sentence to make sure it makes sense.

Find Equivalent Fractions

Fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. The fraction means that one whole has been divided into 3 equal
parts and each part is one of the three equal parts. See Figure 1.11. The fraction represents two of three equal parts.
In the fraction the 2 is called the numerator and the 3 is called the denominator.

Figure 1.11 The circle on the left has been divided into 3 equal parts. Each part is  of the 3 equal parts. In the circle on
the right, of the circle is shaded (2 of the 3 equal parts).

    MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Model Fractions" will help you develop a better understanding of
fractions, their numerators and denominators.

Fraction

A fraction is written where  and

    · a is the numerator and b is the denominator.

A fraction represents parts of a whole. The denominator b is the number of equal parts the whole has been divided
into, and the numerator a indicates how many parts are included.

If a whole pie has been cut into 6 pieces and we eat all 6 pieces, we ate pieces, or, in other words, one whole pie.

So        This leads us to the property of one that tells us that any number, except zero, divided by itself is 1.

       Property of One

       Any number, except zero, divided by itself is one.

       Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Fractions Equivalent to One" will help you develop a better
       understanding of fractions that are equivalent to one.

     If a pie was cut in pieces and we ate all 6, we ate pieces, or, in other words, one whole pie. If the pie was cut into 8
     pieces and we ate all 8, we ate pieces, or one whole pie. We ate the same amount--one whole pie.
     The fractions and have the same value, 1, and so they are called equivalent fractions. Equivalent fractions are
     fractions that have the same value.
     Let's think of pizzas this time. Figure 1.12 shows two images: a single pizza on the left, cut into two equal pieces, and a
     second pizza of the same size, cut into eight pieces on the right. This is a way to show that is equivalent to In other
     words, they are equivalent fractions.

Equivalent Fractions

Equivalent fractions are fractions that have the same value.

How can we use mathematics to change into How could we take a pizza that is cut into 2 pieces and cut it into 8

pieces? We could cut each of the 2 larger pieces into 4 smaller pieces! The whole pizza would then be cut into pieces

instead of just 2. Mathematically, what we've described could be written like this as        See Figure 1.13.

                 Figure 1.13 Cutting each half of the pizza into pieces, gives us pizza cut into 8 pieces:

Simplify Fractions

A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator.

For example,

· is simplified because there are no common factors of 2 and 3.

·    is not simplified because is a common factor of 10 and 15.

Simplified Fraction

A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors in its numerator and denominator.

The phrase reduce a fraction means to simplify the fraction. We simplify, or reduce, a fraction by removing the common
factors of the numerator and denominator. A fraction is not simplified until all common factors have been removed. If an
expression has fractions, it is not completely simplified until the fractions are simplified.

In Example 1.64, we used the equivalent fractions property to find equivalent fractions. Now we'll use the equivalent
fractions property in reverse to simplify fractions. We can rewrite the property to show both forms together.

grouping symbol. The order of operations then tells us to simplify the numerator and then the denominator. Then we
divide.

To simplify the expression       we first simplify the numerator and the denominator separately. Then we divide.

Add or Subtract Fractions with a Common Denominator

To add or subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator.

Add or Subtract Fractions with Different Denominators

As we have seen, to add or subtract fractions, their denominators must be the same. The least common denominator
(LCD) of two fractions is the smallest number that can be used as a common denominator of the fractions. The LCD of
the two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators.

  Least Common Denominator

  The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators.

          MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

  Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Finding the Least Common Denominator" will help you develop a better
  understanding of the LCD.

After we find the least common denominator of two fractions, we convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the
LCD. Putting these steps together allows us to add and subtract fractions because their denominators will be the same!

     HOW TO

Add or Subtract Fractions.

Step 1.  Do they have a common denominator?
           Yes--go to step 2.
           No--rewrite each fraction with the LCD (least common denominator). Find the LCD. Change each fraction

               into an equivalent fraction with the LCD as its denominator.

Step 2. Add or subtract the fractions.
Step 3. Simplify, if possible.

When finding the equivalent fractions needed to create the common denominators, there is a quick way to find the
number we need to multiply both the numerator and denominator. This method works if we found the LCD by factoring
into primes.

Look at the factors of the LCD and then at each column above those factors. The "missing" factors of each denominator
are the numbers we need.

In Example 1.81, the LCD, 36, has two factors of 2 and two factors of
The numerator 12 has two factors of 2 but only one of 3--so it is "missing" one 3--we multiply the numerator and

denominator by 3.
The numerator 18 is missing one factor of 2--so we multiply the numerator and denominator by 2.
We will apply this method as we subtract the fractions in Example 1.82.

  EXAMPLE 1.82
Subtract:

     Solution
Do the fractions have a common denominator? No, so we need to find the LCD.

  Find the LCD.
  Notice, 15 is "missing" three factors of 2 and 24 is "missing" the 5 from the factors of the
  LCD. So we multiply 8 in the first fraction and 5 in the second fraction to get the LCD.
  Rewrite as equivalent fractions with the LCD.

    Name and Write Decimals

       Decimals are another way of writing fractions whose denominators are powers of 10.

       Notice that "ten thousand" is a number larger than one, but "one ten-thousandth" is a number smaller than one. The "th"
       at the end of the name tells you that the number is smaller than one.
       When we name a whole number, the name corresponds to the place value based on the powers of ten. We read 10,000
       as "ten thousand" and 10,000,000 as "ten million." Likewise, the names of the decimal places correspond to their fraction
       values. Figure 1.14 shows the names of the place values to the left and right of the decimal point.

Add and Subtract Decimals

To add or subtract decimals, we line up the decimal points. By lining up the decimal points this way, we can add or
subtract the corresponding place values. We then add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers and then
place the decimal point in the sum.

Multiply and Divide Decimals

Multiplying decimals is very much like multiplying whole numbers--we just have to determine where to place the
decimal point. The procedure for multiplying decimals will make sense if we first convert them to fractions and then
multiply.
So let's see what we would get as the product of decimals by converting them to fractions first. We will do two examples
side-by-side. Look for a pattern!

  Convert to fractions.

  Multiply.

  Convert to decimals.

Notice, in the first example, we multiplied two numbers that each had one digit after the decimal point and the product
had two decimal places. In the second example, we multiplied a number with one decimal place by a number with two
decimal places and the product had three decimal places.
We multiply the numbers just as we do whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal point. We then count the
number of decimal points in the factors and that sum tells us the number of decimal places in the product.
The rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers apply to decimals, too, of course!
When multiplying two numbers,

  · if their signs are the same the product is positive.
  · if their signs are different the product is negative.
When we multiply signed decimals, first we determine the sign of the product and then multiply as if the numbers were
both positive. Finally, we write the product with the appropriate sign.

     HOW TO

Step 1.  Determine the sign of the product.
Step 2.  Write in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole
         numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal points.
Step 3.  Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the number of decimal
         places in the factors.
Step 4.  Write the product with the appropriate sign.

  EXAMPLE 1.98                                                 (-3.9)(4.075)

     Solution

  The signs are different. The product will be negative.

Write in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right.

Multiply.
Add the number of decimal places in the factors (1 + 3).

Place the decimal point 4 places from the right.               (-3.9)(4.075) = -15.8925
The signs are different, so the product is negative.

number of decimal places we move the decimal point to the right to get the product.

Just as with multiplication, division of decimals is very much like dividing whole numbers. We just have to figure out
where the decimal point must be placed.
To divide decimals, determine what power of 10 to multiply the denominator by to make it a whole number. Then
multiply the numerator by that same power of Because of the equivalent fractions property, we haven't changed the
value of the fraction! The effect is to move the decimal points in the numerator and denominator the same number of
places to the right. For example:

We use the rules for dividing positive and negative numbers with decimals, too. When dividing signed decimals, first
determine the sign of the quotient and then divide as if the numbers were both positive. Finally, write the quotient with
the appropriate sign.

Divide Decimals.

Step 1.  Determine the sign of the quotient.
Step 2.  Make the divisor a whole number by "moving" the decimal point all the way to the right. "Move" the decimal
         point in the dividend the same number of places--adding zeros as needed.
Step 3.  Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend.
Step 4.  Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.

      A common application of dividing whole numbers into decimals is when we want to find the price of one item that is sold
      as part of a multi-pack. For example, suppose a case of 24 water bottles costs $3.99. To find the price of one water bottle,
      we would divide $3.99 by 24. We show this division in Example 1.101. In calculations with money, we will round the
      answer to the nearest cent (hundredth).

Convert Decimals, Fractions, and Percents

We convert decimals into fractions by identifying the place value of the last (farthest right) digit. In the decimal 0.03 the 3
is in the hundredths place, so 100 is the denominator of the fraction equivalent to 0.03.

Notice, when the number to the left of the decimal is zero, we get a fraction whose numerator is less than its
denominator. Fractions like this are called proper fractions.

  Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Square Numbers" will help you develop a better understanding of
  perfect square numbers.

Complete the following table to show the squares of the counting numbers 1 through 15.

The numbers in the second row are called perfect square numbers. It will be helpful to learn to recognize the perfect
square numbers.

The squares of the counting numbers are positive numbers. What about the squares of negative numbers? We know
that when the signs of two numbers are the same, their product is positive. So the square of any negative number is also
positive.

Did you notice that these squares are the same as the squares of the positive numbers?

Sometimes we will need to look at the relationship between numbers and their squares in reverse. Because
we say 100 is the square of 10. We also say that 10 is a square root of 100. A number whose square is is called a
square root of m.

Square Root of a Number

If          then n is a square root of m.

Notice            also, so is also a square root of 100. Therefore, both 10 and are square roots of 100.

So, every positive number has two square roots--one positive and one negative. What if we only wanted the positive

square root of a positive number? The radical sign,      denotes the positive square root. The positive square root is

called the principal square root. When we use the radical sign that always means we want the principal square root.

We also use the radical sign for the square root of zero. Because    Notice that zero has only one square
root.

Identify Integers, Rational Numbers, Irrational Numbers, and Real Numbers

We have already described numbers as counting numbers, whole numbers, and integers. What is the difference
between these types of numbers?

What type of numbers would we get if we started with all the integers and then included all the fractions? The numbers
we would have form the set of rational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be written as a ratio of two
integers.

  Rational Number

  A rational number is a number of the form where p and q are integers and
  A rational number can be written as the ratio of two integers.

All signed fractions, such as              are rational numbers. Each numerator and each denominator is an integer.

Are integers rational numbers? To decide if an integer is a rational number, we try to write it as a ratio of two integers.
Each integer can be written as a ratio of integers in many ways. For example, 3 is equivalent to

An easy way to write an integer as a ratio of integers is to write it as a fraction with denominator one.

Since any integer can be written as the ratio of two integers, all integers are rational numbers! Remember that the
counting numbers and the whole numbers are also integers, and so they, too, are rational.

What about decimals? Are they rational? Let's look at a few to see if we can write each of them as the ratio of two
integers.

We've already seen that integers are rational numbers. The integer   could be written as the decimal  So, clearly,
some decimals are rational.

Think about the decimal 7.3. Can we write it as a ratio of two integers? Because 7.3 means  we can write it as an
improper fraction, So 7.3 is the ratio of the integers 73 and 10. It is a rational number.

In general, any decimal that ends after a number of digits (such as 7.3 or   is a rational number. We can use the

reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the place value of the last digit as the denominator when writing the decimal as a

fraction.

EXAMPLE 1.110

Write as the ratio of two integers:    7.31.

     Solution

                                                             
                                 Write it as a fraction with denominator 1.

                                                                              
         Write it as a mixed number. Remember, 7 is the whole number and the decimal part, 0.31, indicates

                                                                      hundredths.

TRY IT 1.220 Write as the ratio of two integers:                      8.41.

Let's look at the decimal form of the numbers we know are rational.

We have seen that every integer is a rational number, since        for any integer, a. We can also change any integer to a
decimal by adding a decimal point and a zero.

We have also seen that every fraction is a rational number. Look at the decimal form of the fractions we considered
above.

What do these examples tell us?

Every rational number can be written both as a ratio of integers,    where p and q are integers and   and as a
decimal that either stops or repeats.

Here are the numbers we looked at above expressed as a ratio of integers and as a decimal:

A rational number is a number of the form          where p and q are integers and
Its decimal form stops or repeats.

Are there any decimals that do not stop or repeat? Yes!
The number (the Greek letter pi, pronounced "pie"), which is very important in describing circles, has a decimal form
that does not stop or repeat.

We can even create a decimal pattern that does not stop or repeat, such as

Numbers whose decimal form does not stop or repeat cannot be written as a fraction of integers. We call these numbers
irrational.

  Irrational Number

  An irrational number is a number that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers.
  Its decimal form does not stop and does not repeat.

Let's summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is rational or irrational.

  Rational or Irrational?

  If the decimal form of a number

We see that 0.40 is to the right of 0.04 on the number line. This is another way to demonstrate that 0.40 > 0.04.

How does 0.31 compare to 0.308? This doesn't translate into money to make it easy to compare. But if we convert 0.31
and 0.308 into fractions, we can tell which is larger.

We need a common denominator to compare them.

Because 310 > 308, we know that     Therefore, 0.31 > 0.308.

Notice what we did in converting 0.31 to a fraction--we started with the fraction and ended with the equivalent

fraction             Converting  back to a decimal gives 0.310. So 0.31 is equivalent to 0.310. Writing zeros at the end of a

decimal does not change its value!

We say 0.31 and 0.310 are equivalent decimals.
  Equivalent Decimals
  Two decimals are equivalent if they convert to equivalent fractions.

We use equivalent decimals when we order decimals.

The steps we take to order decimals are summarized here.

                 HOW TO

Order Decimals.

Step 1.   Write the numbers one under the other, lining up the decimal points.
Step 2.   Check to see if both numbers have the same number of digits. If not, write zeros at the end of the one with
          fewer digits to make them match.
Step 3.   Compare the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
Step 4.   Order the numbers using the appropriate inequality sign.

Use the Commutative and Associative Properties

Think about adding two numbers, say 5 and 3. The order we add them doesn't affect the result, does it?

The results are the same.
As we can see, the order in which we add does not matter!
What about multiplying

Again, the results are the same!
The order in which we multiply does not matter!
These examples illustrate the commutative property. When adding or multiplying, changing the order gives the same
result.

  Commutative Property

What about subtraction? Does order matter when we subtract numbers? Does  give the same result as

The results are not the same.
Since changing the order of the subtraction did not give the same result, we know that subtraction is not commutative.
Let's see what happens when we divide two numbers. Is division commutative?

The results are not the same.

Since changing the order of the division did not give the same result, division is not commutative. The commutative
properties only apply to addition and multiplication!

When multiplying three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers gives the same result.
You probably know this, but the terminology may be new to you. These examples illustrate the associative property.

  Associative Property

When adding or multiplying, changing the grouping gives the same result.

Let's think again about multiplying  We got the same result both ways, but which way was easier? Multiplying

and first, as shown above on the right side, eliminates the fraction in the first step. Using the associative property can
make the math easier!

The associative property has to do with grouping. If we change how the numbers are grouped, the result will be the
same. Notice it is the same three numbers in the same order--the only difference is the grouping.

We saw that subtraction and division were not commutative. They are not associative either.

When simplifying an expression, it is always a good idea to plan what the steps will be. In order to combine like terms in
the next example, we will use the commutative property of addition to write the like terms together.

We can check division with the related multiplication fact.

So we know           because

Division of Zero

For any real number a, except           and

Zero divided by any real number except zero is zero.

Now think about dividing by zero. What is the result of dividing 4 by 0? Think about the related multiplication fact:

means                Is there a number that multiplied by 0 gives 4? Since any real number multiplied by 0 gives 0,

there is no real number that can be multiplied by 0 to obtain 4.

We conclude that there is no answer to       and so we say that division by 0 is undefined.

Division by Zero

For any real number a, except 0, and         are undefined.
Division by zero is undefined.

We summarize the properties of zero below.

Simplify Expressions Using the Distributive Property

Suppose that three friends are going to the movies. They each need $9.25--that's 9 dollars and 1 quarter--to pay for
their tickets. How much money do they need all together?
You can think about the dollars separately from the quarters. They need 3 times $9 so $27, and 3 times 1 quarter, so 75
cents. In total, they need $27.75. If you think about doing the math in this way, you are using the distributive property.

  Distributive Property

Back to our friends at the movies, we could find the total amount of money they need like this:

In algebra, we use the distributive property to remove parentheses as we simplify expressions.

For example, if we are asked to simplify the expression  the order of operations says to work in the

parentheses first. But we cannot add x and 4, since they are not like terms. So we use the distributive property, as shown

in Example 1.132.

Make Unit Conversions in the U.S. System

There are two systems of measurement commonly used around the world. Most countries use the metric system. The
U.S. uses a different system of measurement, usually called the U.S. system. We will look at the U.S. system first.

The U.S. system of measurement uses units of inch, foot, yard, and mile to measure length and pound and ton to
measure weight. For capacity, the units used are cup, pint, quart, and gallons. Both the U.S. system and the metric
system measure time in seconds, minutes, and hours.

The equivalencies of measurements are shown in Table 1.58. The table also shows, in parentheses, the common
abbreviations for each measurement.

                                                                U.S. System of Measurement

   Table 1.58
In many real-life applications, we need to convert between units of measurement, such as feet and yards, minutes and
seconds, quarts and gallons, etc. We will use the identity property of multiplication to do these conversions. We'll restate
the identity property of multiplication here for easy reference.

  Identity Property of Multiplication

To use the identity property of multiplication, we write 1 in a form that will help us convert the units. For example,
suppose we want to change inches to feet. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so we will write 1 as the fraction

             When we multiply by this fraction we do not change the value, but just change the units.
154 1 · Foundations

But                  also equals 1. How do we decide whether to multiply by  or  We choose the fraction that

will make the units we want to convert from divide out. Treat the unit words like factors and "divide out" common units
like we do common factors. If we want to convert inches to feet, which multiplication will eliminate the inches?

The inches divide out and leave only feet. The second form does not have any units that will divide out and so will not
help us.

  EXAMPLE 1.140

How to Make Unit Conversions
MaryAnne is 66 inches tall. Convert her height into feet.

     Solution

     TRY IT 1.279 Lexie is 30 inches tall. Convert her height to feet.

     TRY IT 1.280 Rene bought a hose that is 18 yards long. Convert the length to feet.

          HOW TO

Make Unit Conversions.

Step 1.  Multiply the measurement to be converted by 1; write 1 as a fraction relating the units given and the units
         needed.
Step 2.  Multiply.
Step 3.  Simplify the fraction.
Step 4.  Simplify.

When we use the identity property of multiplication to convert units, we need to make sure the units we want to change
from will divide out. Usually this means we want the conversion fraction to have those units in the denominator.

TRY IT 1.282 The Carnival Destiny cruise ship weighs 51,000 tons. Convert the weight to pounds.

Sometimes, to convert from one unit to another, we may need to use several other units in between, so we will need to
multiply several fractions.

  EXAMPLE 1.142

Juliet is going with her family to their summer home. She will be away from her boyfriend for 9 weeks. Convert the time
to minutes.

     Solution
To convert weeks into minutes we will convert weeks into days, days into hours, and then hours into minutes. To do this
we will multiply by conversion factors of 1.

                                                                                                            9 weeks

Use Mixed Units of Measurement in the U.S. System

We often use mixed units of measurement in everyday situations. Suppose Joe is 5 feet 10 inches tall, stays at work for 7
hours and 45 minutes, and then eats a 1 pound 2 ounce steak for dinner--all these measurements have mixed units.
Performing arithmetic operations on measurements with mixed units of measures requires care. Be sure to add or
subtract like units!

Make Unit Conversions in the Metric System

In the metric system, units are related by powers of 10. The roots words of their names reflect this relation. For
example, the basic unit for measuring length is a meter. One kilometer is 1,000 meters; the prefix kilo means thousand.
One centimeter is of a meter, just like one cent is of one dollar.

To make conversions in the metric system, we will use the same technique we did in the US system. Using the identity
property of multiplication, we will multiply by a conversion factor of one to get to the correct units.
Have you ever run a 5K or 10K race? The length of those races are measured in kilometers. The metric system is
commonly used in the United States when talking about the length of a race.

As you become familiar with the metric system you may see a pattern. Since the system is based on multiples of ten, the
calculations involve multiplying by multiples of ten. We have learned how to simplify these calculations by just moving
the decimal.

To multiply by 10, 100, or 1,000, we move the decimal to the right one, two, or three places, respectively. To multiply by
0.1, 0.01, or 0.001, we move the decimal to the left one, two, or three places, respectively.

We can apply this pattern when we make measurement conversions in the metric system. In Example 1.147, we changed

3,200 grams to kilograms by multiplying by  (or 0.001). This is the same as moving the decimal three places to the

left.

    Use Mixed Units of Measurement in the Metric System

       Performing arithmetic operations on measurements with mixed units of measures in the metric system requires the
       same care we used in the US system. But it may be easier because of the relation of the units to the powers of 10. Make
       sure to add or subtract like units.

      Step 4. Name the decimal place of the last digit.

  · Write a Decimal
      Step 1. Look for the word `and'--it locates the decimal point. Place a decimal point under the word `and.' Translate
                  the words before `and' into the whole number and place it to the left of the decimal point. If there is no
                  "and," write a "0" with a decimal point to its right.
      Step 2. Mark the number of decimal places needed to the right of the decimal point by noting the place value
                  indicated by the last word.
      Step 3. Translate the words after `and' into the number to the right of the decimal point. Write the number in the
                  spaces--putting the final digit in the last place.
      Step 4. Fill in zeros for place holders as needed.

  · Round a Decimal
      Step 1. Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow.
      Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the place value.

                  the digit in the given place value.
      Step 4. Rewrite the number, deleting all digits to the right of the rounding digit.

  · Add or Subtract Decimals
      Step 1. Write the numbers so the decimal points line up vertically.
      Step 2. Use zeros as place holders, as needed.
      Step 3. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Then place the decimal in the answer under
                  the decimal points in the given numbers.

  · Multiply Decimals
      Step 1. Determine the sign of the product.
      Step 2. Write in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole
                  numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal points.
      Step 3. Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the decimal places in
                  the factors.
      Step 4. Write the product with the appropriate sign.

  · Multiply a Decimal by a Power of Ten
      Step 1. Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places as the number of zeros in the power of 10.
      Step 2. Add zeros at the end of the number as needed.

  · Divide Decimals
      Step 1. Determine the sign of the quotient.
      Step 2. Make the divisor a whole number by "moving" the decimal point all the way to the right. "Move" the decimal
                  point in the dividend the same number of places - adding zeros as needed.

Verify a Solution of an Equation

Solving an equation is like discovering the answer to a puzzle. The purpose in solving an equation is to find the value or
values of the variable that make each side of the equation the same - so that we end up with a true statement. Any value
of the variable that makes the equation true is called a solution to the equation. It is the answer to the puzzle!

  Solution of an equation

  A solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.

       ...

            HOW TO

To determine whether a number is a solution to an equation.

Step 1.  Substitute the number in for the variable in the equation.
Step 2.
Step 3.  Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.

         Determine whether the resulting equation is true (the left side is equal to the right side)
           If it is true, the number is a solution.
           If it is not true, the number is not a solution.

EXAMPLE 2.1

Determine whether                is a solution of           .

     Solution
Since a solution to an equation is a value of the variable that makes the equation true, begin by substituting the value of
the solution for the variable.

Multiply.
Subtract.

Since      results in a true equation (4 is in fact equal to 4), is a solution to the equation        .

Solve Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality

We are going to use a model to clarify the process of solving an equation. An envelope represents the variable - since its
contents are unknown - and each counter represents one. We will set out one envelope and some counters on our
workspace, as shown in Figure 2.2. Both sides of the workspace have the same number of counters, but some counters
are "hidden" in the envelope. Can you tell how many counters are in the envelope?

Figure 2.2 The illustration shows a model of an equation with one variable. On the left side of the workspace is an
unknown (envelope) and three counters, while on the right side of the workspace are eight counters.

What are you thinking? What steps are you taking in your mind to figure out how many counters are in the envelope?

Perhaps you are thinking: "I need to remove the 3 counters at the bottom left to get the envelope by itself. The 3
counters on the left can be matched with 3 on the right and so I can take them away from both sides. That leaves five on
the right--so there must be 5 counters in the envelope." See Figure 2.3 for an illustration of this process.

Figure 2.3 The illustration shows a model for solving an equation with one variable. On both sides of the workspace
remove three counters, leaving only the unknown (envelope) and five counters on the right side. The unknown is equal
to five counters.

What algebraic equation would match this situation? In Figure 2.4 each side of the workspace represents an expression
and the center line takes the place of the equal sign. We will call the contents of the envelope .

               Figure 2.4 The illustration shows a model for the equation  .

Let's write algebraically the steps we took to discover how many counters were in the envelope:

  First, we took away three from each side.

  Then we were left with five.

Check:
Five in the envelope plus three more does equal eight!

Our model has given us an idea of what we need to do to solve one kind of equation. The goal is to isolate the variable
by itself on one side of the equation. To solve equations such as these mathematically, we use the Subtraction Property
of Equality.
192 2 · Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities

         Subtraction Property of Equality
        For any numbers a, b, and c,

         When you subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.

                 MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS
         Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Subtraction Property of Equality" will help you develop a better
         understanding of how to solve equations by using the Subtraction Property of Equality.
       Let's see how to use this property to solve an equation. Remember, the goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the
       equation. And we check our solutions by substituting the value into the equation to make sure we have a true statement.
         EXAMPLE 2.2
       Solve:

            Solution
      To get y by itself, we will undo the addition of 37 by using the Subtraction Property of Equality.

What happens when an equation has a number subtracted from the variable, as in the equation  ? We use

another property of equations to solve equations where a number is subtracted from the variable. We want to isolate the

variable, so to `undo' the subtraction we will add the number to both sides. We use the Addition Property of Equality.

  When you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality.

In Example 2.2, 37 was added to the y and so we subtracted 37 to `undo' the addition. In Example 2.3, we will need to

Solve Equations That Require Simplification

In the previous examples, we were able to isolate the variable with just one operation. Most of the equations we
encounter in algebra will take more steps to solve. Usually, we will need to simplify one or both sides of an equation
before using the Subtraction or Addition Properties of Equality.
You should always simplify as much as possible before you try to isolate the variable. Remember that to simplify an
expression means to do all the operations in the expression. Simplify one side of the equation at a time. Note that
simplification is different from the process used to solve an equation in which we apply an operation to both sides.

      Most of the time a question that requires an algebraic solution comes out of a real life question. To begin with that
      question is asked in English (or the language of the person asking) and not in math symbols. Because of this, it is an
      important skill to be able to translate an everyday situation into algebraic language.
      We will start by restating the problem in just one sentence, assign a variable, and then translate the sentence into an

Solve Equations Using the Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality

You may have noticed that all of the equations we have solved so far have been of the form     or                     . We

were able to isolate the variable by adding or subtracting the constant term on the side of the equation with the variable.

Now we will see how to solve equations that have a variable multiplied by a constant and so will require division to

isolate the variable.

Let's look at our puzzle again with the envelopes and counters in Figure 2.5.
204 2 · Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities

Figure 2.5 The illustration shows a model of an equation with one variable multiplied by a constant. On the left side of
the workspace are two instances of the unknown (envelope), while on the right side of the workspace are six counters.

In the illustration there are two identical envelopes that contain the same number of counters. Remember, the left side
of the workspace must equal the right side, but the counters on the left side are "hidden" in the envelopes. So how many
counters are in each envelope?

How do we determine the number? We have to separate the counters on the right side into two groups of the same size

to correspond with the two envelopes on the left side. The 6 counters divided into 2 equal groups gives 3 counters in

each group (since                ).

What equation models the situation shown in Figure 2.6? There are two envelopes, and each contains counters.
Together, the two envelopes must contain a total of 6 counters.

                                 Figure 2.6 The illustration shows a model of the equation  .

If we divide both sides of the equation by 2, as we did with the envelopes and counters,
we get:

We found that each envelope contains 3 counters. Does this check? We know                   , so it works! Three counters in
each of two envelopes does equal six!

This example leads to the Division Property of Equality.

The Division Property of Equality

For any numbers a, b, and c, and                   ,

When you divide both sides of an equation by any non-zero number, you still have equality.

Consider the equation  . We want to know what number divided by 4 gives 3. So to "undo" the division, we will need

to multiply by 4. The Multiplication Property of Equality will allow us to do this. This property says that if we start with
two equal quantities and multiply both by the same number, the results are equal.

on the other side. This does not happen all the time--so now we will learn to solve equations in which the variable terms,
or constant terms, or both are on both sides of the equation.
Our strategy will involve choosing one side of the equation to be the "variable side", and the other side of the equation to
be the "constant side." Then, we will use the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality to get all the variable terms
together on one side of the equation and the constant terms together on the other side.
By doing this, we will transform the equation that began with variables and constants on both sides into the form

Equality.

Solve:
     Solution

In this equation, the variable is found only on the left side. It makes sense to call the left side the "variable" side.
Therefore, the right side will be the "constant" side. We will write the labels above the equation to help us remember
what goes where.

Since the left side is the " ", or variable side, the 8 is out of place. We must "undo" adding 8 by subtracting 8, and to keep
the equality we must subtract 8 from both sides.

                 HOW TO

Beginning Strategy for Solving Equations with Variables and Constants on Both Sides of the Equation.

Step 1.  Choose which side will be the "variable" side--the other side will be the "constant" side.
Step 2.  Collect the variable terms to the "variable" side of the equation, using the Addition or Subtraction Property of
         Equality.
Step 3.  Collect all the constants to the other side of the equation, using the Addition or Subtraction Property of
         Equality.
Step 4.  Make the coefficient of the variable equal 1, using the Multiplication or Division Property of Equality.
Step 5.  Check the solution by substituting it into the original equation.

In Step 1, a helpful approach is to make the "variable" side the side that has the variable with the larger coefficient. This
usually makes the arithmetic easier.

  EXAMPLE 2.33

Solve:
     Solution

In the first step, choose the variable side by comparing the coefficients of the variables on each side.

Since    , make the left side the "variable" side.

Solve Equations Using the General Strategy

Until now we have dealt with solving one specific form of a linear equation. It is time now to lay out one overall strategy
that can be used to solve any linear equation. Some equations we solve will not require all these steps to solve, but many
will.
Beginning by simplifying each side of the equation makes the remaining steps easier.

Classify Equations

Consider the equation we solved at the start of the last section,              . The solution we found was  . This

means the equation       is true when we replace the variable, x, with the value . We showed this when we

checked the solution  and evaluated                for                .

If we evaluate        for a different value of x, the left side will not be .

The equation          is true when we replace the variable, x, with the value , but not true when we replace x

with any other value. Whether or not the equation                  is true depends on the value of the variable. Equations

like this are called conditional equations.

All the equations we have solved so far are conditional equations.

Conditional equation

An equation that is true for one or more values of the variable and false for all other values of the variable is a
conditional equation.

This means that the equation                       is true for any value of y. We say the solution to the equation is all of the

real numbers. An equation that is true for any value of the variable like this is called an identity.

This method worked fine, but many students do not feel very confident when they see all those fractions. So, we are
going to show an alternate method to solve equations with fractions. This alternate method eliminates the fractions.

We will apply the Multiplication Property of Equality and multiply both sides of an equation by the least common
denominator of all the fractions in the equation. The result of this operation will be a new equation, equivalent to the
first, but without fractions. This process is called "clearing" the equation of fractions.

Let's solve a similar equation, but this time use the method that eliminates the fractions.

Use the Distance, Rate, and Time Formula

One formula you will use often in algebra and in everyday life is the formula for distance traveled by an object moving at
a constant rate. Rate is an equivalent word for "speed." The basic idea of rate may already familiar to you. Do you know
what distance you travel if you drive at a steady rate of 60 miles per hour for 2 hours? (This might happen if you use your
car's cruise control while driving on the highway.) If you said 120 miles, you already know how to use this formula!

  Distance, Rate, and Time

  For an object moving at a uniform (constant) rate, the distance traveled, the elapsed time, and the rate are related by
  the formula:

We will use the Strategy for Solving Applications that we used earlier in this chapter. When our problem requires a
formula, we change Step 4. In place of writing a sentence, we write the appropriate formula. We write the revised steps
here for reference.

Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable

You are probably familiar with some geometry formulas. A formula is a mathematical description of the relationship
between variables. Formulas are also used in the sciences, such as chemistry, physics, and biology. In medicine they are
used for calculations for dispensing medicine or determining body mass index. Spreadsheet programs rely on formulas
to make calculations. It is important to be familiar with formulas and be able to manipulate them easily.

In Example 2.58 and Example 2.59, we used the formula  . This formula gives the value of , distance, when you

substitute in the values of      , the rate and time. But in Example 2.59, we had to find the value of . We substituted in

values of     and then used algebra to solve for . If you had to do this often, you might wonder why there is not a

formula that gives the value of when you substitute in the values of  . We can make a formula like this by solving

the formula        for .

To solve a formula for a specific variable means to isolate that variable on one side of the equals sign with a coefficient of
1. All other variables and constants are on the other side of the equals sign. To see how to solve a formula for a specific
variable, we will start with the distance, rate and time formula.

Solution

Graph Inequalities on the Number Line

Do you remember what it means for a number to be a solution to an equation? A solution of an equation is a value of a
variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.

What about the solution of an inequality? What number would make the inequality  true? Are you thinking, `x could

be 4'? That's correct, but x could be 5 too, or 20, or even 3.001. Any number greater than 3 is a solution to the inequality
258 2 · Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities

.

We show the solutions to the inequality            on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of 3, to show

that all numbers greater than 3 are solutions. Because the number 3 itself is not a solution, we put an open parenthesis

at 3. The graph of  is shown in Figure 2.7. Please note that the following convention is used: light blue arrows point

in the positive direction and dark blue arrows point in the negative direction.

                                 Figure 2.7 The inequality    is graphed on this number line.

The graph of the inequality      is very much like the graph of                 , but now we need to show that 3 is a solution, too.

We do that by putting a bracket at                 , as shown in Figure 2.8.

                                 Figure 2.8 The inequality    is graphed on this number line.

Notice that the open parentheses symbol, (, shows that the endpoint of the inequality is not included. The open bracket
symbol, [, shows that the endpoint is included.

EXAMPLE 2.66

Graph on the number line:



Solution



This means all numbers less than or equal to 1. We shade in all the numbers on the number line to the left of 1 and

put a bracket at    to show that it is included.



This means all numbers less than 5, but not including 5. We shade in all the numbers on the number line to the left of

5 and put a parenthesis at       to show it is not included.

We can also represent inequalities using interval notation. As we saw above, the inequality    means all numbers

greater than 3. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In interval notation, we express  as 

The symbol  is read as `infinity'. It is not an actual number. Figure 2.9 shows both the number line and the interval

Solve Inequalities using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Inequality

The Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality state that if two quantities are equal, when we add or subtract the
same amount from both quantities, the results will be equal.

Properties of Equality

Similar properties hold true for inequalities.
  For example, we know that -4 is less than 2.
  If we subtract 5 from both quantities, is the
  left side still less than the right side?
  We get -9 on the left and -3 on the right.

And we know -9 is less than -3.

                                          The inequality sign stayed the same.

Similarly we could show that the inequality also stays the same for addition.
This leads us to the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Inequality.

  Properties of Inequality

We use these properties to solve inequalities, taking the same steps we used to solve equations. Solving the inequality
             , the steps would look like this:

                      Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate .

Solve Inequalities using the Division and Multiplication Properties of Inequality

The Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality state that if two quantities are equal, when we divide or multiply
both quantities by the same amount, the results will also be equal (provided we don't divide by 0).

  Properties of Equality

Are there similar properties for inequalities? What happens to an inequality when we divide or multiply both sides by a
constant?

Consider some numerical examples.

Divide both sides by 5.                            Multiply both sides by 5.
Simplify.
Fill in the inequality signs.

Does the inequality stay the same when we divide or multiply by a negative number?

Divide both sides by -5.                           Multiply both sides by -5.
Simplify.
Fill in the inequality signs.

When we divide or multiply an inequality by a positive number, the inequality sign stays the same. When we divide or
multiply an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses.

Just like some equations are identities and some are contradictions, inequalities may be identities or contradictions, too.
We recognize these forms when we are left with only constants as we solve the inequality. If the result is a true
statement, we have an identity. If the result is a false statement, we have a contradiction.

Translate to an Inequality and Solve

To translate English sentences into inequalities, we need to recognize the phrases that indicate the inequality. Some
words are easy, like `more than' and `less than'. But others are not as obvious.

Think about the phrase `at least' - what does it mean to be `at least 21 years old'? It means 21 or more. The phrase `at
least' is the same as `greater than or equal to'.

     Approach Word Problems with a Positive Attitude

       "If you think you can... or think you can't... you're right."--Henry Ford
       The world is full of word problems! Will my income qualify me to rent that apartment? How much punch do I need to
       make for the party? What size diamond can I afford to buy my girlfriend? Should I fly or drive to my family reunion?
       How much money do I need to fill the car with gas? How much tip should I leave at a restaurant? How many socks should
       I pack for vacation? What size turkey do I need to buy for Thanksgiving dinner, and then what time do I need to put it in
       the oven? If my sister and I buy our mother a present, how much does each of us pay?
       Now that we can solve equations, we are ready to apply our new skills to word problems. Do you know anyone who has
       had negative experiences in the past with word problems? Have you ever had thoughts like the student below?

       When we feel we have no control, and continue repeating negative thoughts, we set up barriers to success. We need to
       calm our fears and change our negative feelings.
       Start with a fresh slate and begin to think positive thoughts. If we take control and believe we can be successful, we will
       be able to master word problems! Read the positive thoughts in Figure 3.3 and say them out loud.

Use a Problem-Solving Strategy for Word Problems

We have reviewed translating English phrases into algebraic expressions, using some basic mathematical vocabulary and
symbols. We have also translated English sentences into algebraic equations and solved some word problems. The word
problems applied math to everyday situations. We restated the situation in one sentence, assigned a variable, and then
wrote an equation to solve the problem. This method works as long as the situation is familiar and the math is not too
complicated.

Now, we'll expand our strategy so we can use it to successfully solve any word problem. We'll list the strategy here, and
then we'll use it to solve some problems. We summarize below an effective strategy for problem solving.

             ...

                 HOW TO

Use a Problem-Solving Strategy to Solve Word Problems.

Step 1.  Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
Step 2.  Identify what we are looking for.
Step 3.  Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
Step 4.  Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important
         information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation.
Step 5.  Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.
Step 6.  Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Step 7.  Answer the question with a complete sentence.

  EXAMPLE 3.1

Pilar bought a purse on sale for $18, which is one-half of the original price. What was the original price of the purse?
     Solution

Step 1. Read the problem. Read the problem two or more times if necessary. Look up any unfamiliar words in a
dictionary or on the internet.

  · In this problem, is it clear what is being discussed? Is every word familiar?
Step 2. Identify what you are looking for. Did you ever go into your bedroom to get something and then forget what you
were looking for? It's hard to find something if you are not sure what it is! Read the problem again and look for words
that tell you what you are looking for!

  · In this problem, the words "what was the original price of the purse" tell us what we need to find.
Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. We can use any letter for the
variable, but choose one that makes it easy to remember what it represents.

  · Let the original price of the purse.
Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important
information. Translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation.
Reread the problem carefully to see how the given information is related. Often, there is one sentence that gives this
information, or it may help to write one sentence with all the important information. Look for clue words to help
translate the sentence into algebra. Translate the sentence into an equation.

  Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.

  Translate into an equation.

Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebraic techniques. Even if you know the solution right away, using good
algebraic techniques here will better prepare you to solve problems that do not have obvious answers.
284 3 · Math Models

         Solve the equation.

         Multiply both sides by 2.
         Simplify.

       Step 6. Check the answer in the problem to make sure it makes sense. We solved the equation and found that
       which means "the original price" was $36.

         · Does $36 make sense in the problem? Yes, because 18 is one-half of 36, and the purse was on sale at half the
             original price.

       Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. The problem asked "What was the original price of the purse?"
         · The answer to the question is: "The original price of the purse was $36."

       If this were a homework exercise, our work might look like this:
       Pilar bought a purse on sale for $18, which is one-half the original price. What was the original price of the purse?

                                                                             Let the original price.
                                                                             18 is one-half the original price.

         Multiply both sides by 2.
         Simplify.
         Check. Is $36 a reasonable price for a purse?
         Yes.
         Is 18 one half of 36?

                                               The original price of the purse was $36.

TRY IT 3.1  Joaquin bought a bookcase on sale for $120, which was two-thirds of the original price. What was
            the original price of the bookcase?

  EXAMPLE 3.2

Ginny and her classmates formed a study group. The number of girls in the study group was three more than twice the
number of boys. There were 11 girls in the study group. How many boys were in the study group?

     Solution
  Step 1. Read the problem.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.                           How many boys were in the study group?

Step 3. Name. Choose a variable to represent the number of boys. Let the number of boys.

Step 4. Translate. Restate the problem in one sentence with all
the important information.

Simplify.                                                           There were 4 boys in the study group.

Step 6. Check. First, is our answer reasonable? Yes, having 4 boys
in a study group seems OK. The problem says the number of girls
was 3 more than twice the number of boys. If there are four boys,
does that make eleven girls? Twice 4 boys is 8. Three more than 8
is 11.

Step 7. Answer the question.

Solve Number Problems

Now that we have a problem solving strategy, we will use it on several different types of word problems. The first type we
will work on is "number problems." Number problems give some clues about one or more numbers. We use these clues
to write an equation. Number problems don't usually arise on an everyday basis, but they provide a good introduction to
practicing the problem solving strategy outlined above.

Now that we have worked with consecutive integers, we will expand our work to include consecutive even integers and
consecutive odd integers. Consecutive even integers are even integers that immediately follow one another. Examples of
consecutive even integers are:

Notice each integer is 2 more than the number preceding it. If we call the first one n, then the next one is  The next

one would be    or

Consecutive odd integers are odd integers that immediately follow one another. Consider the consecutive odd integers
77, 79, and 81.

Does it seem strange to add 2 (an even number) to get from one odd integer to the next? Do you get an odd number or
an even number when we add 2 to 3? to 11? to 47?
Whether the problem asks for consecutive even numbers or odd numbers, you don't have to do anything different. The
pattern is still the same--to get from one odd or one even integer to the next, add 2.

Translate and Solve Basic Percent Equations

We will solve percent equations using the methods we used to solve equations with fractions or decimals. Without the
tools of algebra, the best method available to solve percent problems was by setting them up as proportions. Now as an
algebra student, you can just translate English sentences into algebraic equations and then solve the equations.
We can use any letter you like as a variable, but it is a good idea to choose a letter that will remind us of what you are
looking for. We must be sure to change the given percent to a decimal when we put it in the equation.

                      What number is 55% of 60?

We must be very careful when we translate the words in the next example. The unknown quantity will not be isolated at
first, like it was in Example 3.12. We will again use direct translation to write the equation.

  EXAMPLE 3.13

Solve Applications of Percent

Many applications of percent--such as tips, sales tax, discounts, and interest--occur in our daily lives. To solve these
applications we'll translate to a basic percent equation, just like those we solved in previous examples. Once we translate
the sentence into a percent equation, we know how to solve it.

We will restate the problem solving strategy we used earlier for easy reference.

             ...

                 HOW TO

Use a Problem-Solving Strategy to Solve an Application.

Step 1.  Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
Step 2.  Identify what we are looking for.
Step 3.  Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
Step 4.  Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important
         information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation.
Step 5.  Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.
Step 6.  Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Step 7.  Answer the question with a complete sentence.

Now that we have the strategy to refer to, and have practiced solving basic percent equations, we are ready to solve
percent applications. Be sure to ask yourself if your final answer makes sense--since many of the applications will
involve everyday situations, you can rely on your own experience.

Find Percent Increase and Percent Decrease

People in the media often talk about how much an amount has increased or decreased over a certain period of time.
They usually express this increase or decrease as a percent.
To find the percent increase, first we find the amount of increase, the difference of the new amount and the original
amount. Then we find what percent the amount of increase is of the original amount.

Solve Simple Interest Applications

Do you know that banks pay you to keep your money? The money a customer puts in the bank is called the principal, P,
and the money the bank pays the customer is called the interest. The interest is computed as a certain percent of the
principal; called the rate of interest, r. We usually express rate of interest as a percent per year, and we calculate it by
using the decimal equivalent of the percent. The variable t, (for time) represents the number of years the money is in the
account.

To find the interest we use the simple interest formula,

Interest earned according to this formula is called simple interest.

Interest may also be calculated another way, called compound interest. This type of interest will be covered in later math
classes.

Solve Coin Word Problems

In mixture problems, we will have two or more items with different values to combine together. The mixture model is
used by grocers and bartenders to make sure they set fair prices for the products they sell. Many other professionals,
like chemists, investment bankers, and landscapers also use the mixture model.

          MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

  Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity Coin Lab will help you develop a better understanding of mixture word
  problems.

We will start by looking at an application everyone is familiar with--money!
Imagine that we take a handful of coins from a pocket or purse and place them on a desk. How would we determine the
value of that pile of coins? If we can form a step-by-step plan for finding the total value of the coins, it will help us as we
begin solving coin word problems.
So what would we do? To get some order to the mess of coins, we could separate the coins into piles according to their
value. Quarters would go with quarters, dimes with dimes, nickels with nickels, and so on. To get the total value of all the
coins, we would add the total value of each pile.

How would we determine the value of each pile? Think about the dime pile--how much is it worth? If we count the
number of dimes, we'll know how many we have--the number of dimes.
But this does not tell us the value of all the dimes. Say we counted 17 dimes, how much are they worth? Each dime is
worth $0.10--that is the value of one dime. To find the total value of the pile of 17 dimes, multiply 17 by $0.10 to get
$1.70. This is the total value of all 17 dimes. This method leads to the following model.

  Total Value of Coins
  For the same type of coin, the total value of a number of coins is found by using the model

  where
             number is the number of coins
             value is the value of each coin
             total value is the total value of all the coins

The number of dimes times the value of each dime equals the total value of the dimes.

We could continue this process for each type of coin, and then we would know the total value of each type of coin. To get
the total value of all the coins, add the total value of each type of coin.
Let's look at a specific case. Suppose there are 14 quarters, 17 dimes, 21 nickels, and 39 pennies.
320 3 · Math Models

       The total value of all the coins is $6.64.
       Notice how the chart helps organize all the information! Let's see how we use this method to solve a coin word problem.

         EXAMPLE 3.26
       Adalberto has $2.25 in dimes and nickels in his pocket. He has nine more nickels than dimes. How many of each type of
       coin does he have?

            Solution
       Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.

         · Determine the types of coins involved.
             Think about the strategy we used to find the value of the handful of coins. The first thing we need is to notice what
             types of coins are involved. Adalberto has dimes and nickels.

         · Create a table to organize the information. See chart below.
              Label the columns "type," "number," "value," "total value."
              List the types of coins.
              Write in the value of each type of coin.
              Write in the total value of all the coins.
             We can work this problem all in cents or in dollars. Here we will do it in dollars and put in the dollar sign ($) in the
             table as a reminder.
             The value of a dime is $0.10 and the value of a nickel is $0.05. The total value of all the coins is $2.25. The table
             below shows this information.

       Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.
         · We are asked to find the number of dimes and nickels Adalberto has.

       Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
         · Use variable expressions to represent the number of each type of coin and write them in the table.
         · Multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of coin.

       Next we counted the number of each type of coin. In this problem we cannot count each type of coin--that is what you
       are looking for--but we have a clue. There are nine more nickels than dimes. The number of nickels is nine more than
       the number of dimes.

       Fill in the "number" column in the table to help get everything organized.

       Now we have all the information we need from the problem!

We multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of coin. While we do not know the actual
number, we do have an expression to represent it.

And so now multiply               See how this is done in the table below.

Notice that we made the heading of the table show the model.

Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence. Translate the English
sentence into an algebraic equation.

Write the equation by adding the total values of all the types of coins.

Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.

Now solve this equation.

Distribute.

Combine like terms.

Subtract 0.45 from each side.

Divide.

So there are 12 dimes.

The number of nickels is       .

TRY IT 3.58  At the movie theater, the total value of tickets sold was $2,612.50. Adult tickets sold for $10 each
             and senior/child tickets sold for $7.50 each. The number of senior/child tickets sold was 25 less
             than twice the number of adult tickets sold. How many senior/child tickets and how many adult
             tickets were sold?

We have learned how to find the total number of tickets when the number of one type of ticket is based on the number
of the other type. Next, we'll look at an example where we know the total number of tickets and have to figure out how
the two types of tickets relate.

Suppose Bianca sold a total of 100 tickets. Each ticket was either an adult ticket or a child ticket. If she sold 20 child
tickets, how many adult tickets did she sell?

· Did you say `80'? How did you figure that out? Did you subtract 20 from 100?

If she sold 45 child tickets, how many adult tickets did she sell?

· Did you say `55'? How did you find it? By subtracting 45 from 100?

What if she sold 75 child tickets? How many adult tickets did she sell?

· The number of adult tickets must be  She sold 25 adult tickets.

Now, suppose Bianca sold x child tickets. Then how many adult tickets did she sell? To find out, we would follow the same
logic we used above. In each case, we subtracted the number of child tickets from 100 to get the number of adult tickets.
We now do the same with x.

We have summarized this below.

We can apply these techniques to other examples
  EXAMPLE 3.30

Galen sold 810 tickets for his church's carnival for a total of $2,820. Children's tickets cost $3 each and adult tickets cost
$5 each. How many children's tickets and how many adult tickets did he sell?

     Solution
Step 1. Read the problem.

  · Determine the types of tickets involved. There are children tickets and adult tickets.
  · Create a table to organize the information.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.
  · We are looking for the number of children and adult tickets.

Step 3. Name. Represent the number of each type of ticket using variables.
  · We know the total number of tickets sold was 810. This means the number of children's tickets plus the number of
      adult tickets must add up to 810.
  · Let c be the number of children tickets.
328 3 · Math Models

· Then               is the number of adult tickets.

· Multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of ticket.

Step 4. Translate.
  · Write the equation by adding the total values of each type of ticket.

Step 5. Solve the equation.

How many adults?

Step 6. Check the answer. There were 615 children's tickets at $3 each and 195 adult tickets at $5 each. Is the total value
$2,820?

Step 7. Answer the question. Galen sold 615 children's tickets and 195 adult tickets.

TRY IT 3.59          During her shift at the museum ticket booth, Leah sold 115 tickets for a total of $1,163. Adult
                     tickets cost $12 and student tickets cost $5. How many adult tickets and how many student
                     tickets did Leah sell?

TRY IT 3.60          A whale-watching ship had 40 paying passengers on board. The total collected from tickets was
                     $1,196. Full-fare passengers paid $32 each and reduced-fare passengers paid $26 each. How
                     many full-fare passengers and how many reduced-fare passengers were on the ship?

Now, we'll do one where we fill in the table all at once.

  EXAMPLE 3.31

Monica paid $8.36 for stamps. The number of 41-cent stamps was four more than twice the number of two-cent stamps.
How many 41-cent stamps and how many two-cent stamps did Monica buy?

     Solution
The types of stamps are 41-cent stamps and two-cent stamps. Their names also give the value!

Solve Mixture Word Problems

Now we'll solve some more general applications of the mixture model. Grocers and bartenders use the mixture model to
set a fair price for a product made from mixing two or more ingredients. Financial planners use the mixture model when
they invest money in a variety of accounts and want to find the overall interest rate. Landscape designers use the
mixture model when they have an assortment of plants and a fixed budget, and event coordinators do the same when
choosing appetizers and entrees for a banquet.

Our first mixture word problem will be making trail mix from raisins and nuts.

  EXAMPLE 3.32

Henning is mixing raisins and nuts to make 10 pounds of trail mix. Raisins cost $2 a pound and nuts cost $6 a pound. If
Henning wants his cost for the trail mix to be $5.20 a pound, how many pounds of raisins and how many pounds of nuts
should he use?
330 3 · Math Models

            Solution
       As before, we fill in a chart to organize our information.
       The 10 pounds of trail mix will come from mixing raisins and nuts.

       We enter the price per pound for each item.
       We multiply the number times the value to get the total value.

Notice that the last line in the table gives the information for the total amount of the mixture.
We know the value of the raisins plus the value of the nuts will be the value of the trail mix.

  Write the equation from the total values.
  Solve the equation.

Find the number of pounds of nuts.                                         8 pounds of nuts
Check.

                                    Henning mixed two pounds of raisins with eight pounds of nuts.

TRY IT 3.63        Orlando is mixing nuts and cereal squares to make a party mix. Nuts sell for $7 a pound and
                   cereal squares sell for $4 a pound. Orlando wants to make 30 pounds of party mix at a cost of
                   $6.50 a pound, how many pounds of nuts and how many pounds of cereal squares should he
                   use?

TRY IT 3.64        Becca wants to mix fruit juice and soda to make a punch. She can buy fruit juice for $3 a gallon
                   and soda for $4 a gallon. If she wants to make 28 gallons of punch at a cost of $3.25 a gallon,
                   how many gallons of fruit juice and how many gallons of soda should she buy?

We can also use the mixture model to solve investment problems using simple interest. We have used the simple

interest formula,                where represented the number of years. When we just need to find the interest for one year,

        so then
  EXAMPLE 3.33
Stacey has $20,000 to invest in two different bank accounts. One account pays interest at 3% per year and the other
account pays interest at 5% per year. How much should she invest in each account if she wants to earn 4.5% interest per
year on the total amount?

     Solution
We will fill in a chart to organize our information. We will use the simple interest formula to find the interest earned in
the different accounts.
The interest on the mixed investment will come from adding the interest from the account earning 3% and the interest
from the account earning 5% to get the total interest on the $20,000.

The amount invested is the principal for each account.
We enter the interest rate for each account.
We multiply the amount invested times the rate to get the interest.

Notice that the total amount invested, 20,000, is the sum of the amount invested at 3% and the amount invested at 5%.

And the total interest,  is the sum of the interest earned in the 3% account and the interest earned in the

5% account.

As with the other mixture applications, the last column in the table gives us the equation to solve.

Write the equation from the interest earned.
Solve the equation.

                                                                      amount invested at 3%
Find the amount invested at 5%.
Check.

                         Stacey should invest $5,000 in the account that
                         earns 3% and $15,000 in the account that earns 5%.

Solve Applications Using Properties of Triangles

In this section we will use some common geometry formulas. We will adapt our problem-solving strategy so that we can
solve geometry applications. The geometry formula will name the variables and give us the equation to solve. In
addition, since these applications will all involve shapes of some sort, most people find it helpful to draw a figure and
label it with the given information. We will include this in the first step of the problem solving strategy for geometry
applications.

         sense in the context of the problem.
Step 7.  Answer the question with a complete sentence.

We will start geometry applications by looking at the properties of triangles. Let's review some basic facts about
triangles. Triangles have three sides and three interior angles. Usually each side is labeled with a lowercase letter to
match the uppercase letter of the opposite vertex.

The plural of the word vertex is vertices. All triangles have three vertices. Triangles are named by their vertices: The

             Figure 3.4 Triangle ABC has vertices A, B, and C. The lengths of the sides are a, b, and c.

The three angles of a triangle are related in a special way. The sum of their measures is  Note that we read             as

"the measure of angle A." So in  in Figure 3.4,

Because the perimeter of a figure is the length of its boundary, the perimeter of          is the sum of the lengths of its
three sides.

To find the area of a triangle, we need to know its base and height. The height is a line that connects the base to the

opposite vertex and makes a angle with the base. We will draw              again, and now show the height, h. See

Figure 3.5.

Use the Pythagorean Theorem

We have learned how the measures of the angles of a triangle relate to each other. Now, we will learn how the lengths of
the sides relate to each other. An important property that describes the relationship among the lengths of the three
sides of a right triangle is called the Pythagorean Theorem. This theorem has been used around the world since ancient
times. It is named after the Greek philosopher and mathematician, Pythagoras, who lived around 500 BC.

Before we state the Pythagorean Theorem, we need to introduce some terms for the sides of a triangle. Remember that
a right triangle has a angle, marked with a small square in the corner. The side of the triangle opposite the angle
is called the hypotenuse and each of the other sides are called legs.

The Pythagorean Theorem tells how the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle relate to each other. It states that in

any right triangle, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs equals the square of the length of the

hypotenuse. In symbols we say: in any right triangle,  where                       are the lengths of the legs and is the

length of the hypotenuse.

Writing the formula in every exercise and saying it aloud as you write it, may help you remember the Pythagorean
Theorem.

    The Pythagorean Theorem

    In any right triangle,

    where a and b are the lengths of the legs, c is the length of the hypotenuse.

To solve exercises that use the Pythagorean Theorem, we will need to find square roots. We have used the notation
and the definition:

If  then                    for

For example, we found that       is 5 because

Because the Pythagorean Theorem contains variables that are squared, to solve for the length of a side in a right
triangle, we will have to use square roots.

Solve Uniform Motion Applications

When planning a road trip, it often helps to know how long it will take to reach the destination or how far to travel each

day. We would use the distance, rate, and time formula,  which we have already seen.

In this section, we will use this formula in situations that require a little more algebra to solve than the ones we saw
earlier. Generally, we will be looking at comparing two scenarios, such as two vehicles travelling at different rates or in
opposite directions. When the speed of each vehicle is constant, we call applications like this uniform motion problems.

Our problem-solving strategies will still apply here, but we will add to the first step. The first step will include drawing a
diagram that shows what is happening in the example. Drawing the diagram helps us understand what is happening so
that we will write an appropriate equation. Then we will make a table to organize the information, like we did for the
money applications.

The steps are listed here for easy reference:

...

     HOW TO

Use a Problem-Solving Strategy in Distance, Rate, and Time Applications.

Step 1.  Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
           Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening.
           Create a table to organize the information.
           Label the columns rate, time, distance.
           List the two scenarios.
           Write in the information you know.

Step 2.  Identify what we are looking for.
Step 3.
         Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
           Complete the chart.
           Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.
           Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.

Step 4. Translate into an equation.
              Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
              Then, translate the sentence into an equation.

Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.
Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.

  EXAMPLE 3.48

An express train and a local train leave Pittsburgh to travel to Washington, D.C. The express train can make the trip in 4
hours and the local train takes 5 hours for the trip. The speed of the express train is 12 miles per hour faster than the
speed of the local train. Find the speed of both trains.

     Solution
Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.

  · Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening. Shown below is a sketch of what is happening in the example.

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                    3.5 · Solve Uniform Motion Applications 361

  · Create a table to organize the information.
  · Label the columns "Rate," "Time," and "Distance."
  · List the two scenarios.
  · Write in the information you know.
Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.
  · We are asked to find the speed of both trains.
  · Notice that the distance formula uses the word "rate," but it is more common to use "speed" when we talk about

      vehicles in everyday English.
Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

  · Complete the chart
  · Use variable expressions to represent that quantity in each row.
  · We are looking for the speed of the trains. Let's let r represent the speed of the local train. Since the speed of the

      express train is 12 mph faster, we represent that as

Fill in the speeds into the chart.

Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.

Step 4. Translate into an equation.
  · Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
  · Then, translate the sentence into an equation.
  · The equation to model this situation will come from the relation between the distances. Look at the diagram we
      drew above. How is the distance travelled by the express train related to the distance travelled by the local train?
  · Since both trains leave from Pittsburgh and travel to Washington, D.C. they travel the same distance. So we write:
362 3 · Math Models

Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.

Now solve this equation.

                                      So the speed of the local train is 48 mph.

Find the speed of the express train.

                                      The speed of the express train is 60 mph.

Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
                                                   express train
                                                     local train

                                                 Table 3.11
Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.

  · The speed of the local train is 48 mph and the speed of the express train is 60 mph.

TRY IT 3.95          Wayne and Dennis like to ride the bike path from Riverside Park to the beach. Dennis's speed is
                     seven miles per hour faster than Wayne's speed, so it takes Wayne 2 hours to ride to the beach
                     while it takes Dennis 1.5 hours for the ride. Find the speed of both bikers.

TRY IT 3.96          Jeromy can drive from his house in Cleveland to his college in Chicago in 4.5 hours. It takes his
                     mother 6 hours to make the same drive. Jeromy drives 20 miles per hour faster than his mother.
                     Find Jeromy's speed and his mother's speed.

In Example 3.48, the last example, we had two trains traveling the same distance. The diagram and the chart helped us
write the equation we solved. Let's see how this works in another case.

  EXAMPLE 3.49

Christopher and his parents live 115 miles apart. They met at a restaurant between their homes to celebrate his mother's
birthday. Christopher drove 1.5 hours while his parents drove 1 hour to get to the restaurant. Christopher's average
speed was 10 miles per hour faster than his parents' average speed. What were the average speeds of Christopher and
of his parents as they drove to the restaurant?

     Solution
Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.

      Christopher's speed is 10 mph faster, we represent that as

Fill in the speeds into the chart.

Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance.
Step 4. Translate into an equation.

  · Restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information.
  · Then, translate the sentence into an equation.
  · Again, we need to identify a relationship between the distances in order to write an equation. Look at the diagram

      we created above and notice the relationship between the distance Christopher traveled and the distance his
      parents traveled.
The distance Christopher travelled plus the distance his parents travel must add up to 115 miles. So we write:

Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.
                                         Now solve this equation.

                                           So the parents' speed was 40 mph.

     Solution
Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.

· Draw a diagram to illustrate what it happening.

  · Create a table to organize the information.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.
  · We are asked to find the amount of time the trucks will travel until they are 325 miles apart.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity.
  · We are looking for the time travelled. Both trucks will travel the same amount of time. Let's call the time t. Since
      their speeds are different, they will travel different distances.
  · Complete the chart.

Step 4. Translate into an equation.
  · We need to find a relation between the distances in order to write an equation. Looking at the diagram, what is the
      relationship between the distance each of the trucks will travel?
  · The distance traveled by the truck going west plus the distance travelled by the truck going east must add up to 325
      miles. So we write:

Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques.
                                                    Now solve this equation.

                                                 Table 3.15
So it will take the trucks 2.5 hours to be 325 miles apart.

Matching Units in Problems

It is important to make sure the units match when we use the distance rate and time formula. For instance, if the rate
is in miles per hour, then the time must be in hours.

  EXAMPLE 3.51

When Katie Mae walks to school, it takes her 30 minutes. If she rides her bike, it takes her 15 minutes. Her speed is three
miles per hour faster when she rides her bike than when she walks. What are her walking speed and her speed riding
her bike?

     Solution
First, we draw a diagram that represents the situation to help us see what is happening.

We are asked to find her speed walking and riding her bike. Let's call her walking speed r. Since her biking speed is three

miles per hour faster, we will call that speed  We write the speeds in the chart.

                                                                                                                                                    3.5 · Solve Uniform Motion Applications 367

The speed is in miles per hour, so we need to express the times in hours, too, in order for the units to be the same.
Remember, one hour is 60 minutes. So:

Next, we multiply rate times time to fill in the distance column.

The equation will come from the fact that the distance from Katie Mae's home to her school is the same whether she is
walking or riding her bike.
So we say:

  Translate into an equation.

  Solve this equation.
  Clear the fractions by multiplying by the LCD of all the fractions in
  the equation.

Simplify.                                                                 6 mph
                                                        (Katie Mae's biking speed)
Let's check if this works.
Walk 3 mph (0.5 hour) = 1.5 miles                       Katie Mae's walking speed is 3 mph.
Bike 6 mph (0.25 hour) = 1.5 miles                      Her speed riding her bike is 6 mph.
Yes, either way Katie Mae travels 1.5 miles to school.

              faster than her speed going uphill. Find Suzy's uphill and downhill speeds.

TRY IT 3.102  Llewyn takes 45 minutes to drive his boat upstream from the dock to his favorite fishing spot. It
              takes him 30 minutes to drive the boat back downstream to the dock. The boat's speed going
368 3 · Math Models

                                           downstream is four miles per hour faster than its speed going upstream. Find the boat's
                                           upstream and downstream speeds.
       In the distance, rate, and time formula, time represents the actual amount of elapsed time (in hours, minutes, etc.). If a
       problem gives us starting and ending times as clock times, we must find the elapsed time in order to use the formula.
         EXAMPLE 3.52
       Hamilton loves to travel to Las Vegas, 255 miles from his home in Orange County. On his last trip, he left his house at
       2:00 pm. The first part of his trip was on congested city freeways. At 4:00 pm, the traffic cleared and he was able to drive
       through the desert at a speed 1.75 times as fast as when he drove in the congested area. He arrived in Las Vegas at 6:30
       pm. How fast was he driving during each part of his trip?
            Solution
       A diagram will help us model this trip.

       Next, we create a table to organize the information.
       We know the total distance is 255 miles. We are looking for the rate of speed for each part of the trip. The rate in the
       desert is 1.75 times the rate in the city. If we let the rate in the city, then the rate in the desert is
       The times here are given as clock times. Hamilton started from home at 2:00 pm and entered the desert at 4:30 pm. So
       he spent two hours driving the congested freeways in the city. Then he drove faster from 4:00 pm until 6:30 pm in the
       desert. So he drove 2.5 hours in the desert.
       Now, we multiply the rates by the times.

       By looking at the diagram below, we can see that the sum of the distance driven in the city and the distance driven in the
       desert is 255 miles.

3.6 Solve Applications with Linear Inequalities

Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
           Solve applications with linear inequalities

       BE PREPARED 3.19 Before you get started, take this readiness quiz.

                                            Write as an inequality: x is at least 30.
                                             If you missed this problem, review Example 2.77.

BE PREPARED 3.20                 Solve
                                 If you missed this problem, review Example 2.73.

Solve Applications with Linear Inequalities

Many real-life situations require us to solve inequalities. In fact, inequality applications are so common that we often do
not even realize we are doing algebra. For example, how many gallons of gas can be put in the car for $20? Is the rent on
an apartment affordable? Is there enough time before class to go get lunch, eat it, and return? How much money should
each family member's holiday gift cost without going over budget?

The method we will use to solve applications with linear inequalities is very much like the one we used when we solved
applications with equations. We will read the problem and make sure all the words are understood. Next, we will identify
what we are looking for and assign a variable to represent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it easy
to translate into an inequality. Then, we will solve the inequality.

  EXAMPLE 3.53

Emma got a new job and will have to move. Her monthly income will be $5,625. To qualify to rent an apartment, Emma's
monthly income must be at least three times as much as the rent. What is the highest rent Emma will qualify for?

     Solution

                           Step 1. Read the problem.

            Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.  the highest rent Emma will qualify for

    Step 3. Name what we are looking for.                                          Let the rent.
Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

               Step 4. Translate into an inequality.            Emma's monthly income must be at least three
First write a sentence that gives the information to find it.                          times the rent.

            Step 5. Solve the inequality.

Remember,     has the same meaning as                      .

    Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it    The maximum rent is $1,875.
                                    makes sense.

   A maximum rent of $1,875 seems reasonable for an income
                                       of $5,625.

      Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.

Table 3.18

TRY IT 3.105  Alan is loading a pallet with boxes that each weighs 45 pounds. The pallet can safely support
              no more than 900 pounds. How many boxes can he safely load onto the pallet?

TRY IT 3.106  The elevator in Yehire's apartment building has a sign that says the maximum weight is 2,100
              pounds. If the average weight of one person is 150 pounds, how many people can safely ride
              the elevator?

Sometimes an application requires the solution to be a whole number, but the algebraic solution to the inequality is not a
whole number. In that case, we must round the algebraic solution to a whole number. The context of the application will
determine whether we round up or down. To check applications like this, we will round our answer to a number that is
easy to compute with and make sure that number makes the inequality true.

  EXAMPLE 3.54

Dawn won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom. The tablets she would like to buy cost
$254.12 each, including tax and delivery. What is the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy?

     Solution

                           Step 1. Read the problem.

            Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.           the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy

                Step 3. Name what we are looking for.           Let the number of tablets.
            Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

Step 4. Translate. Write a sentence that gives the information  $254.12 times the number of tablets is no more
                                     to find it.                                        than $4,000.

                        Translate into an inequality.

Table 3.19
374 3 · Math Models

                          Step 5. Solve the inequality.         Dawn can buy a maximum of 15 tablets.

      But must be a whole number of tablets, so round to 15.

     Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it
                                     makes sense.

       Rounding down the price to $250, 15 tablets would cost
                                         $3,750,

  while 16 tablets would be $4,000. So a maximum of 15 tablets
                                             at

                           $254.12 seems reasonable.

       Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence.

                     is the maximum number of people Daniel can have at the party?

  EXAMPLE 3.55

How much should his total sales be for his variable pay option to exceed the fixed amount of $925?

     Solution
                     Step 1. Read the problem.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.           the total sales needed for his variable pay option to exceed
                                                                           the fixed amount of $925

    Step 3. Name what we are looking for.                       Let the total sales.
Choose a variable to represent that quantity.

Step 4. Translate. Write a sentence that gives the
                    information to find it.

     Translate into an inequality. Remember to
           convert the percent to a decimal.

   Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make               The total sales must be more than $3,541.67.
                         sure it makes sense.

   If we round the total sales up to $4,000, we see that
                                      , which is more than $925.

Plot Points on a Rectangular Coordinate System

Just like maps use a grid system to identify locations, a grid system is used in algebra to show a relationship between
two variables in a rectangular coordinate system. The rectangular coordinate system is also called the xy-plane or the
`coordinate plane'.

The horizontal number line is called the x-axis. The vertical number line is called the y-axis. The x-axis and the y-axis
together form the rectangular coordinate system. These axes divide a plane into four regions, called quadrants. The
quadrants are identified by Roman numerals, beginning on the upper right and proceeding counterclockwise. See Figure
4.2.

                                           Figure 4.2 `Quadrant' has the root `quad,' which means `four.'
In the rectangular coordinate system, every point is represented by an ordered pair. The first number in the ordered pair
is the x-coordinate of the point, and the second number is the y-coordinate of the point.

  Ordered Pair

An ordered pair,  , gives the coordinates of a point in a rectangular coordinate system.

The first number is the x-coordinate.
The second number is the y-coordinate.

The phrase `ordered pair' means the order is important. What is the ordered pair of the point where the axes cross? At

that point both coordinates are zero, so its ordered pair is  . The point          has a special name. It is called the

origin.

The Origin

The point       is called the origin. It is the point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect.

We use the coordinates to locate a point on the xy-plane. Let's plot the point     as an example. First, locate 1 on the

x-axis and lightly sketch a vertical line through  . Then, locate 3 on the y-axis and sketch a horizontal line through

. Now, find the point where these two lines meet--that is the point with coordinates          .

Notice that the vertical line through     and the horizontal line through     are not part of the graph. We just used

them to help us locate the point       .

EXAMPLE 4.1

Plot each point in the rectangular coordinate system and identify the quadrant in which the point is located:

                                                                           .

  Solution

The first number of the coordinate pair is the x-coordinate, and the second number is the y-coordinate.

 Since              , the point is to the left of the y-axis. Also, since     , the point is above the x-axis. The point

is in Quadrant II.

 Since              , the point is to the left of the y-axis. Also, since     , the point is below the x-axis. The point

  is in Quadrant III.

 Since           , the point is to the right of the y-axis. Since          , the point is below the x-axis. The point     is

in Quadrant lV.

 Since              , the point is to the left of the y-axis. Since        , the point is above the x-axis. The point     is in

Quadrant II.

 Since           , the point is to the right of the y-axis. Since          , the point is above the x-axis. (It may be helpful to

write as a mixed number or decimal.) The point    is in Quadrant I.

How do the signs affect the location of the points? You may have noticed some patterns as you graphed the points in the
previous example.

For the point in Figure 4.3 in Quadrant IV, what do you notice about the signs of the coordinates? What about the signs
of the coordinates of points in the third quadrant? The second quadrant? The first quadrant?

Can you tell just by looking at the coordinates in which quadrant the point    is located? In which quadrant is
located?

In algebra, being able to identify the coordinates of a point shown on a graph is just as important as being able to plot

points. To identify the x-coordinate of a point on a graph, read the number on the x-axis directly above or below the

point. To identify the y-coordinate of a point, read the number on the y-axis directly to the left or right of the point.

Remember, when you write the ordered pair use the correct order,        .

Verify Solutions to an Equation in Two Variables

Up to now, all the equations you have solved were equations with just one variable. In almost every case, when you

solved the equation you got exactly one solution. The process of solving an equation ended with a statement like    .

(Then, you checked the solution by substituting back into the equation.)

Here's an example of an equation in one variable, and its one solution.

But equations can have more than one variable. Equations with two variables may be of the form   .

Equations of this form are called linear equations in two variables.

Linear Equation

An equation of the form      , where and are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two
variables.

Notice the word line in linear. Here is an example of a linear equation in two variables, and .

The equation             is also a linear equation. But it does not appear to be in the form     . We can use

the Addition Property of Equality and rewrite it in      form.

                             Add to both sides.

                             Simplify.

              Use the Commutative Property to put it in                  form.

By rewriting             as  , we can easily see that it is a linear equation in two variables because it is of the
form
                 . When an equation is in the form       , we say it is in standard form.

Standard Form of Linear Equation

A linear equation is in standard form when it is written                .

Most people prefer to have , , and      be integers and      when writing a linear equation in standard form,
although it is not strictly necessary.

Linear equations have infinitely many solutions. For every number that is substituted for there is a corresponding

value. This pair of values is a solution to the linear equation and is represented by the ordered pair     . When we

substitute these values of and into the equation, the result is a true statement, because the value on the left side is

equal to the value on the right side.

Solution of a Linear Equation in Two Variables

An ordered pair   is a solution of the linear equation                        , if the equation is a true statement when the

x- and y-values of the ordered pair are substituted into the equation.

Notice how the points line up perfectly? We connect the points with a line to get the graph of the equation             .

See Figure 4.6. Notice the arrows on the ends of each side of the line. These arrows indicate the line continues.

Every point on the line is a solution of the equation. Also, every solution of this equation is a point on this line. Points not
on the line are not solutions.

Notice that the point whose coordinates are  is on the line shown in Figure 4.7. If you substitute                 and

into the equation, you find that it is a solution to the equation.

often shortened to "the point      .")

                 HOW TO

Graph a linear equation by plotting points.

Step 1.         Find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the equation. Organize them in a table.
Step 2.         Plot the points in a rectangular coordinate system. Check that the points line up. If they do not, carefully
                check your work.
Step 3.         Draw the line through the three points. Extend the line to fill the grid and put arrows on both ends of the line.

It is true that it only takes two points to determine a line, but it is a good habit to use three points. If you only plot two
points and one of them is incorrect, you can still draw a line but it will not represent the solutions to the equation. It will
be the wrong line.

If you use three points, and one is incorrect, the points will not line up. This tells you something is wrong and you need
to check your work. Look at the difference between part (a) and part (b) in Figure 4.8.

                                                                              Figure 4.8

Identify the x- and y- Intercepts on a Graph

Every linear equation can be represented by a unique line that shows all the solutions of the equation. We have seen that
when graphing a line by plotting points, you can use any three solutions to graph. This means that two people graphing
the line might use different sets of three points.
At first glance, their two lines might not appear to be the same, since they would have different points labeled. But if all
the work was done correctly, the lines should be exactly the same. One way to recognize that they are indeed the same
line is to look at where the line crosses the x- axis and the y- axis. These points are called the intercepts of the line.

  Intercepts of a Line

  The points where a line crosses the x- axis and the y- axis are called the intercepts of a line.

Let's look at the graphs of the lines in Figure 4.18.

For each row, the y- coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x- axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the

x- axis has the form   and is called the x- intercept of a line. The x- intercept occurs when is zero.

Now, let's look at the points where these lines cross the y- axis. See Table 4.25.

Graph a Line Using the Intercepts

To graph a linear equation by plotting points, you need to find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the
equation. You can use the x- and y- intercepts as two of your three points. Find the intercepts, and then find a third point
to ensure accuracy. Make sure the points line up--then draw the line. This method is often the quickest way to graph a
line.

When you graph linear equations, you may notice that some lines tilt up as they go from left to right and some lines tilt
down. Some lines are very steep and some lines are flatter. What determines whether a line tilts up or down or if it is
steep or flat?
In mathematics, the `tilt' of a line is called the slope of the line. The concept of slope has many applications in the real
world. The pitch of a roof, grade of a highway, and a ramp for a wheelchair are some examples where you literally see
slopes. And when you ride a bicycle, you feel the slope as you pump uphill or coast downhill.

In this section, we will explore the concept of slope.

Use Geoboards to Model Slope

A geoboard is a board with a grid of pegs on it. Using rubber bands on a geoboard gives us a concrete way to model
lines on a coordinate grid. By stretching a rubber band between two pegs on a geoboard, we can discover how to find
the slope of a line.

          MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

  Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Exploring Slope" will help you develop a better understanding of the
  slope of a line. (Graph paper can be used instead of a geoboard, if needed.)

We'll start by stretching a rubber band between two pegs as shown in Figure 4.19.

                                                                             Figure 4.19

Doesn't it look like a line?

Now we stretch one part of the rubber band straight up from the left peg and around a third peg to make the sides of a
right triangle, as shown in Figure 4.20
444 4 · Graphs

                                                                             Figure 4.20
We carefully make a 90º angle around the third peg, so one of the newly formed lines is vertical and the other is
horizontal.
To find the slope of the line, we measure the distance along the vertical and horizontal sides of the triangle. The vertical
distance is called the rise and the horizontal distance is called the run, as shown in Figure 4.21.

                                                                             Figure 4.21
If our geoboard and rubber band look just like the one shown in Figure 4.22, the rise is 2. The rubber band goes up 2
units. (Each space is one unit.)

                            Figure 4.22 The rise on this geoboard is 2, as the rubber band goes up two units.
What is the run?
The rubber band goes across 3 units. The run is 3 (see Figure 4.22).
The slope of a line is the ratio of the rise to the run. In mathematics, it is always referred to with the letter .

  Slope of a Line

The slope of a line of a line is  .

The rise measures the vertical change and the run measures the horizontal change between two points on the line.

What is the slope of the line on the geoboard in Figure 4.22?

The line has slope . This means that the line rises 2 units for every 3 units of run.

When we work with geoboards, it is a good idea to get in the habit of starting at a peg on the left and connecting to a
peg to the right. If the rise goes up it is positive and if it goes down it is negative. The run will go from left to right and be
positive.

Use           to Find the Slope of a Line from its Graph

Now, we'll look at some graphs on the -coordinate plane and see how to find their slopes. The method will be very
similar to what we just modeled on our geoboards.

To find the slope, we must count out the rise and the run. But where do we start?

We locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers. We then start with the point on the left and sketch a
right triangle, so we can count the rise and run.

In the last two examples, the lines had y-intercepts with integer values, so it was convenient to use the y-intercept as one
of the points to find the slope. In the next example, the y-intercept is a fraction. Instead of using that point, we'll look for
two other points whose coordinates are integers. This will make the slope calculations easier.

Use the Slope Formula to find the Slope of a Line Between Two Points

          MANIPULATIVE MATHEMATICS

  Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity "Slope of Lines Between Two Points" will help you develop a better
  understanding of how to find the slope of a line between two points.

Sometimes we'll need to find the slope of a line between two points when we don't have a graph to count out the rise
and the run. We could plot the points on grid paper, then count out the rise and the run, but as we'll see, there is a way
to find the slope without graphing. Before we get to it, we need to introduce some algebraic notation.

We have seen that an ordered pair    gives the coordinates of a point. But when we work with slopes, we use two
points. How can the same symbol     be used to represent two different points? Mathematicians use subscripts to
distinguish the points.

The use of subscripts in math is very much like the use of last name initials in elementary school. Maybe you remember
Laura C. and Laura M. in your third grade class?

We will use       to identify the first point and         to identify the second point.

If we had more than two points, we could use           ,  , and so on.

Let's see how the rise and run relate to the coordinates of the two points by taking another look at the slope of the line

between the points      and    .

Since we have two points, we will use subscript notation,                .

On the graph, we counted the rise of 3 and the run of 5.
Notice that the rise of 3 can be found by subtracting the y-coordinates 6 and 3.

And the run of 5 can be found by subtracting the x-coordinates 7 and 2.

We know           . So      .

We rewrite the rise and run by putting in the coordinates        .

But 6 is , the y-coordinate of the second point and 3 is , the y-coordinate of the first point.

So we can rewrite the slope using subscript notation.

Also, 7 is , the x-coordinate of the second point and 2 is , the x-coordinate of the first point.

So, again, we rewrite the slope using subscript notation.

We've shown that               is really another version of      . We can use this formula to find the slope of a line

when we have two points on the line.

Graph a Line Given a Point and the Slope

Up to now, in this chapter, we have graphed lines by plotting points, by using intercepts, and by recognizing horizontal
and vertical lines.

One other method we can use to graph lines is called the point-slope method. We will use this method when we know
one point and the slope of the line. We will start by plotting the point and then use the definition of slope to draw the
graph of the line.

     Choose the Most Convenient Method to Graph a Line

       Now that we have seen several methods we can use to graph lines, how do we know which method to use for a given
       equation?
       While we could plot points, use the slope-intercept form, or find the intercepts for any equation, if we recognize the
       most convenient way to graph a certain type of equation, our work will be easier. Generally, plotting points is not the
       most efficient way to graph a line. We saw better methods in sections 4.3, 4.4, and earlier in this section. Let's look for
       some patterns to help determine the most convenient method to graph a line.
       Here are six equations we graphed in this chapter, and the method we used to graph each of them.

Equations #1 and #2 each have just one variable. Remember, in equations of this form the value of that one variable is
constant; it does not depend on the value of the other variable. Equations of this form have graphs that are vertical or
horizontal lines.

In equations #3 and #4, both and are on the same side of the equation. These two equations are of the form

            . We substituted           to find the x-intercept and     to find the y-intercept, and then found a third point

by choosing another value for or .

Equations #5 and #6 are written in slope-intercept form. After identifying the slope and y-intercept from the equation
we used them to graph the line.

This leads to the following strategy.

Strategy for Choosing the Most Convenient Method to Graph a Line

Consider the form of the equation.

  · If it only has one variable, it is a vertical or horizontal line.

            is a vertical line passing through the x-axis at .

            is a horizontal line passing through the y-axis at .

  · If is isolated on one side of the equation, in the form            , graph by using the slope and y-intercept.
      Identify the slope and y-intercept and then graph.

  · If the equation is of the form       , find the intercepts.

         Find the x- and y-intercepts, a third point, and then graph.

Graph and Interpret Applications of Slope-Intercept

Many real-world applications are modeled by linear equations. We will take a look at a few applications here so you can
see how equations written in slope-intercept form relate to real-world situations.

Usually when a linear equation models a real-world situation, different letters are used for the variables, instead of x and
y. The variable names remind us of what quantities are being measured.

     Use Slopes to Identify Parallel Lines

       The slope of a line indicates how steep the line is and whether it rises or falls as we read it from left to right. Two lines
       that have the same slope are called parallel lines. Parallel lines never intersect.

       We say this more formally in terms of the rectangular coordinate system. Two lines that have the same slope and
       different y-intercepts are called parallel lines. See Figure 4.27.

Figure 4.27 Verify that both lines have the same slope,  , and different y-intercepts.

What about vertical lines? The slope of a vertical line is undefined, so vertical lines don't fit in the definition above. We say
that vertical lines that have different x-intercepts are parallel. See Figure 4.28.

The slopes of the lines are the same and the y-intercept of each line is different. So we know these lines are parallel.

Use Slopes to Identify Perpendicular Lines

Let's look at the lines whose equations are  and                           , shown in Figure 4.29.

                                             Figure 4.29

These lines lie in the same plane and intersect in right angles. We call these lines perpendicular.

What do you notice about the slopes of these two lines? As we read from left to right, the line      rises, so its

slope is positive. The line                 drops from left to right, so it has a negative slope. Does it make sense to you that

the slopes of two perpendicular lines will have opposite signs?

If we look at the slope of the first line,   , and the slope of the second line,  , we can see that they are

negative reciprocals of each other. If we multiply them, their product is

This is always true for perpendicular lines and leads us to this definition.

Perpendicular Lines

Perpendicular lines are lines in the same plane that form a right angle.

If            are the slopes of two perpendicular lines, then:

Vertical lines and horizontal lines are always perpendicular to each other.

We were able to look at the slope-intercept form of linear equations and determine whether or not the lines were
parallel. We can do the same thing for perpendicular lines.

We find the slope-intercept form of the equation, and then see if the slopes are negative reciprocals. If the product of
the slopes is , the lines are perpendicular. Perpendicular lines may have the same y-intercepts.

equations relating two variables. Data is collected and graphed. If the data points appear to form a straight line, an
equation of that line can be used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of the other variable.

Find an Equation of the Line Given the Slope and a Point

Finding an equation of a line using the slope-intercept form of the equation works well when you are given the slope
and y-intercept or when you read them off a graph. But what happens when you have another point instead of the
y-intercept?

We are going to use the slope formula to derive another form of an equation of the line. Suppose we have a line that has

slope and that contains some specific point  and some other point, which we will just call  . We can write

the slope of this line and then change it to a different form.

Find an Equation of the Line Given Two Points

When real-world data is collected, a linear model can be created from two data points. In the next example we'll see how
to find an equation of a line when just two points are given.

We have two options so far for finding an equation of a line: slope-intercept or point-slope. Since we will know two
points, it will make more sense to use the point-slope form.

Find an Equation of a Line Parallel to a Given Line

Suppose we need to find an equation of a line that passes through a specific point and is parallel to a given line. We can
use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope. So we will have a point and the slope--just what we need to use the
point-slope equation.

First let's look at this graphically.

The graph shows the graph of               . We want to graph a line parallel to this line and passing through the point
         .

We know that parallel lines have the same slope. So the second line will have the same slope as  . That slope

is              . We'll use the notation to represent the slope of a line parallel to a line with slope . (Notice that the

subscript looks like two parallel lines.)

The second line will pass through          and have  . To graph the line, we start at         and count out the rise and

run. With       (or              ), we count out the rise 2 and the run 1. We draw the line.

Do the lines appear parallel? Does the second line pass through        ?

Now, let's see how to do this algebraically.

We can use either the slope-intercept form or the point-slope form to find an equation of a line. Here we know one
point and can find the slope. So we will use the point-slope form.

Find an Equation of a Line Perpendicular to a Given Line

Now, let's consider perpendicular lines. Suppose we need to find a line passing through a specific point and which is
perpendicular to a given line. We can use the fact that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. We
will again use the point-slope equation, like we did with parallel lines.

The graph shows the graph of  . Now, we want to graph a line perpendicular to this line and passing through
         .

We know that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. We'll use the notation to represent the
slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope . (Notice that the subscript  looks like the right angles made by two

To graph the line, we will start at  and count out the rise and the run 2. Then we draw the line.

Verify Solutions to an Inequality in Two Variables

We have learned how to solve inequalities in one variable. Now, we will look at inequalities in two variables. Inequalities
in two variables have many applications. If you ran a business, for example, you would want your revenue to be greater
than your costs--so that your business would make a profit.

Linear Inequality
A linear inequality is an inequality that can be written in one of the following forms:

where             are not both zero.

Do you remember that an inequality with one variable had many solutions? The solution to the inequality  is any

number greater than 3. We showed this on the number line by shading in the number line to the right of 3, and putting

an open parenthesis at 3. See Figure 4.30.

                                                                             Figure 4.30     that makes the inequality true when

Similarly, inequalities in two variables have many solutions. Any ordered pair
we substitute in the values is a solution of the inequality.

Solution of a Linear Inequality

An ordered pair   is a solution of a linear inequality if the inequality is true when we substitute the values of x
and y.

Recognize the Relation Between the Solutions of an Inequality and its Graph

Now, we will look at how the solutions of an inequality relate to its graph.

Let's think about the number line in Figure 4.30 again. The point     separated that number line into two parts. On

one side of 3 are all the numbers less than 3. On the other side of 3 all the numbers are greater than 3. See Figure 4.31.

                                                  Figure 4.31

The solution to      is the shaded part of the number line to the right of      .

Similarly, the line  separates the plane into two regions. On one side of the line are points with      . On

the other side of the line are the points with    . We call the line               a boundary line.
514 4 · Graphs

Boundary Line

The line with equation              is the boundary line that separates the region where           from the

region where                     .

For an inequality in one variable, the endpoint is shown with a parenthesis or a bracket depending on whether or not is
included in the solution:

Similarly, for an inequality in two variables, the boundary line is shown with a solid or dashed line to indicate whether or
not it the line is included in the solution. This is summarized in Table 4.48

                Boundary line is not included in solution. Boundary line is included in solution.

                Boundary line is dashed.                        Boundary line is solid.

                Table 4.48

Now, let's take a look at what we found in Example 4.69. We'll start by graphing the line       , and then we'll plot the
five points we tested. See Figure 4.32.

                                          Figure 4.32

In Example 4.69 we found that some of the points were solutions to the inequality          and some were not.

The two points  and          are on the other side of the boundary line                     , and they are not solutions to
the inequality
                      . For those two points,  .

What about the point  ? Because                , the point is a solution to the equation    . So the point            is on
the boundary line.

Let's take another point on the left side of the boundary line and test whether or not it is a solution to the inequality

. The point                  clearly looks to be to the left of the boundary line, doesn't it? Is it a solution to the inequality?

Any point you choose on the left side of the boundary line is a solution to the inequality           . All points on the left
are solutions.                                                                              , are not solutions to

The graph of the inequality      is shown in Figure 4.34 below. The line                  divides the plane into two

regions. The shaded side shows the solutions to the inequality               .

The points on the boundary line, those where   , are not solutions to the inequality           , so the line itself is

not part of the solution. We show that by making the line dashed, not solid.

                 HOW TO

Graph a linear inequality.

Step 1. Identify and graph the boundary line.

                 If the inequality is     , the boundary line is solid.

                 If the inequality is < or >, the boundary line is dashed.

Step 2.         Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?
Step 3.
                Shade in one side of the boundary line.
                  If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.
                  If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.

Then we test a point. We'll use     again because it is easy to evaluate and it is not on the boundary line.

An architect designing a home may have restrictions on both the area and perimeter of the windows because of energy
and structural concerns. The length and width chosen for each window would have to satisfy two equations: one for the
area and the other for the perimeter. Similarly, a banker may have a fixed amount of money to put into two investment
funds. A restaurant owner may want to increase profits, but in order to do that he will need to hire more staff. A job
applicant may compare salary and costs of commuting for two job offers.

Determine Whether an Ordered Pair is a Solution of a System of Equations

In Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities we learned how to solve linear equations with one variable. Remember that
the solution of an equation is a value of the variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation.
Now we will work with systems of linear equations, two or more linear equations grouped together.

  System of Linear Equations

  When two or more linear equations are grouped together, they form a system of linear equations.

We will focus our work here on systems of two linear equations in two unknowns. Later, you may solve larger systems of
equations.

An example of a system of two linear equations is shown below. We use a brace to show the two equations are grouped
together to form a system of equations.

A linear equation in two variables, like 2x + y = 7, has an infinite number of solutions. Its graph is a line. Remember, every
point on the line is a solution to the equation and every solution to the equation is a point on the line.
To solve a system of two linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions to both
equations. In other words, we are looking for the ordered pairs (x, y) that make both equations true. These are called the
solutions to a system of equations.

  Solutions of a System of Equations

  Solutions of a system of equations are the values of the variables that make all the equations true. A solution of a
  system of two linear equations is represented by an ordered pair (x, y).

To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two equations, we substitute the values of the variables into
each equation. If the ordered pair makes both equations true, it is a solution to the system.
Let's consider the system below:

Is the ordered pair                  a solution?

The ordered pair (2, -1) made both equations true. Therefore (2, -1) is a solution to this system.
Let's try another ordered pair. Is the ordered pair (3, 2) a solution?

                                                                         5.1 · Solve Systems of Equations by Graphing 545

The ordered pair (3, 2) made one equation true, but it made the other equation false. Since it is not a solution to both
equations, it is not a solution to this system.

  EXAMPLE 5.1

Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system:

            

  Solution



(-2, -1) does not make both equations true. (-2, -1) is not a solution.



(-4, -3) does not make both equations true. (-4, -3) is a solution.

Solve a System of Linear Equations by Graphing

In this chapter we will use three methods to solve a system of linear equations. The first method we'll use is graphing.

The graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two
equations, we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And, by finding
what the lines have in common, we'll find the solution to the system.

Most linear equations in one variable have one solution, but we saw that some equations, called contradictions, have no
solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers are solutions.

Similarly, when we solve a system of two linear equations represented by a graph of two lines in the same plane, there
are three possible cases, as shown in Figure 5.2:
546 5 · Systems of Linear Equations

                                                                                     Figure 5.2
       For the first example of solving a system of linear equations in this section and in the next two sections, we will solve the
       same system of two linear equations. But we'll use a different method in each section. After seeing the third method,
       you'll decide which method was the most convenient way to solve this system.

If you write the second equation in Example 5.8 in slope-intercept form, you may recognize that the equations have the
same slope and same y-intercept.
When we graphed the second line in the last example, we drew it right over the first line. We say the two lines are
coincident. Coincident lines have the same slope and same y-intercept.

  Coincident Lines
  Coincident lines have the same slope and same y-intercept.

Determine the Number of Solutions of a Linear System

There will be times when we will want to know how many solutions there will be to a system of linear equations, but we
might not actually have to find the solution. It will be helpful to determine this without graphing.
We have seen that two lines in the same plane must either intersect or are parallel. The systems of equations in Example
5.2 through Example 5.6 all had two intersecting lines. Each system had one solution.
A system with parallel lines, like Example 5.7, has no solution. What happened in Example 5.8? The equations have
coincident lines, and so the system had infinitely many solutions.
We'll organize these results in Figure 5.3 below:

                                                                              Figure 5.3
Parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. So, if we write both equations in a system of linear
equations in slope-intercept form, we can see how many solutions there will be without graphing! Look at the system we
solved in Example 5.7.

The two lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. They are parallel lines.
Figure 5.4 shows how to determine the number of solutions of a linear system by looking at the slopes and intercepts.

                                                                              Figure 5.4
Let's take one more look at our equations in Example 5.7 that gave us parallel lines.
556 5 · Systems of Linear Equations

       When both lines were in slope-intercept form we had:

Do you recognize that it is impossible to have a single ordered pair     that is a solution to both of those equations?

We call a system of equations like this an inconsistent system. It has no solution.

A system of equations that has at least one solution is called a consistent system.

Consistent and Inconsistent Systems

A consistent system of equations is a system of equations with at least one solution.
An inconsistent system of equations is a system of equations with no solution.

We also categorize the equations in a system of equations by calling the equations independent or dependent. If two
equations are independent equations, they each have their own set of solutions. Intersecting lines and parallel lines are
independent.
If two equations are dependent, all the solutions of one equation are also solutions of the other equation. When we
graph two dependent equations, we get coincident lines.

  Independent and Dependent Equations

  Two equations are independent if they have different solutions.
  Two equations are dependent if all the solutions of one equation are also solutions of the other equation.

Let's sum this up by looking at the graphs of the three types of systems. See Figure 5.5 and Figure 5.6.

                                                             Figure 5.5

Solving systems of linear equations by graphing is a good way to visualize the types of solutions that may result.
However, there are many cases where solving a system by graphing is inconvenient or imprecise. If the graphs extend
beyond the small grid with x and y both between -10 and 10, graphing the lines may be cumbersome. And if the
solutions to the system are not integers, it can be hard to read their values precisely from a graph.

In this section, we will solve systems of linear equations by the substitution method.

     Solve a System of Equations by Substitution

       We will use the same system we used first for graphing.
       We will first solve one of the equations for either x or y. We can choose either equation and solve for either variable--but
       we'll try to make a choice that will keep the work easy.
       Then we substitute that expression into the other equation. The result is an equation with just one variable--and we
       know how to solve those!
       After we find the value of one variable, we will substitute that value into one of the original equations and solve for the
       other variable. Finally, we check our solution and make sure it makes both equations true.
       We'll fill in all these steps now in Example 5.13.

We have solved systems of linear equations by graphing and by substitution. Graphing works well when the variable
coefficients are small and the solution has integer values. Substitution works well when we can easily solve one equation
for one of the variables and not have too many fractions in the resulting expression.

The third method of solving systems of linear equations is called the Elimination Method. When we solved a system by
substitution, we started with two equations and two variables and reduced it to one equation with one variable. This is
580 5 · Systems of Linear Equations

       what we'll do with the elimination method, too, but we'll have a different way to get there.

     Solve a System of Equations by Elimination

       The Elimination Method is based on the Addition Property of Equality. The Addition Property of Equality says that when
       you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality. We will extend the Addition Property of
       Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the results are equal.
       For any expressions a, b, c, and d,

       To solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we decide which
       variable will be easiest to eliminate. How do we decide? We want to have the coefficients of one variable be opposites, so
       that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable.
       Notice how that works when we add these two equations together:

       The y's add to zero and we have one equation with one variable.
       Let's try another one:

       This time we don't see a variable that can be immediately eliminated if we add the equations.
       But if we multiply the first equation by -2, we will make the coefficients of x opposites. We must multiply every term on
       both sides of the equation by -2.

       Now we see that the coefficients of the x terms are opposites, so x will be eliminated when we add these two equations.
       Add the equations yourself--the result should be -3y = -6. And that looks easy to solve, doesn't it? Here is what it would
       look like.

       We'll do one more:

       It doesn't appear that we can get the coefficients of one variable to be opposites by multiplying one of the equations by
       a constant, unless we use fractions. So instead, we'll have to multiply both equations by a constant.
       We can make the coefficients of x be opposites if we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by -4, so we get 12x
       and -12x.

       This gives us these two new equations:

When we add these equations,

the x's are eliminated and we just have -29y = 58.
Once we get an equation with just one variable, we solve it. Then we substitute that value into one of the original
equations to solve for the remaining variable. And, as always, we check our answer to make sure it is a solution to both
of the original equations.
Now we'll see how to use elimination to solve the same system of equations we solved by graphing and by substitution.

  coefficients of y, we will multiply the first equation by 2
  and the second equation by 3.

Choose the Most Convenient Method to Solve a System of Linear Equations

When you will have to solve a system of linear equations in a later math class, you will usually not be told which method
to use. You will need to make that decision yourself. So you'll want to choose the method that is easiest to do and
minimizes your chance of making mistakes.

Previously in this chapter we solved several applications with systems of linear equations. In this section, we'll look at
some specific types of applications that relate two quantities. We'll translate the words into linear equations, decide
which is the most convenient method to use, and then solve them.

We will use our Problem Solving Strategy for Systems of Linear Equations.

             ...

                 HOW TO

Use a problem solving strategy for systems of linear equations.

Step 1.  Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood.
Step 2.  Identify what we are looking for.
Step 3.  Name what we are looking for. Choose variables to represent those quantities.
Step 4.  Translate into a system of equations.
Step 5.  Solve the system of equations using good algebra techniques.
Step 6.  Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense.
Step 7.  Answer the question with a complete sentence.

Translate to a System of Equations

Many of the problems we solved in earlier applications related two quantities. Here are two of the examples from the
chapter on Math Models.

  · The sum of two numbers is negative fourteen. One number is four less than the other. Find the numbers.
  · A married couple together earns $110,000 a year. The wife earns $16,000 less than twice what her husband earns.

      What does the husband earn?

In that chapter we translated each situation into one equation using only one variable. Sometimes it was a bit of a
challenge figuring out how to name the two quantities, wasn't it?

Let's see how we can translate these two problems into a system of equations with two variables. We'll focus on Steps 1
through 4 of our Problem Solving Strategy.

Now we'll add to our list some properties of angles.

Solve Uniform Motion Applications

We used a table to organize the information in uniform motion problems when we introduced them earlier. We'll
continue using the table here. The basic equation was D = rt where D is the distance travelled, r is the rate, and t is the
time.

Our first example of a uniform motion application will be for a situation similar to some we have already seen, but now
we can use two variables and two equations.

  EXAMPLE 5.42

Translate to a system of equations and then solve:

Joni left St. Louis on the interstate, driving west towards Denver at a speed of 65 miles per hour. Half an hour later, Kelly
left St. Louis on the same route as Joni, driving 78 miles per hour. How long will it take Kelly to catch up to Joni?

     Solution
A diagram is useful in helping us visualize the situation.

Identify and name what we are looking for.

We are looking for the length of time Kelly,

k, and Joni, j, will each drive.

Since  we can fill in the Distance column.

Translate into a system of equations.
To make the system of equations, we must recognize that Kelly and Joni will drive the same distance. So,

Also, since Kelly left later, her time will be hour less than Joni's time.

So,

Now we have the system.

for k.

      Joni 3 hours (65 mph) = 195 miles.                                    By then, Joni will have traveled 3 hours.

Many real-world applications of uniform motion arise because of the effects of currents--of water or air--on the actual
speed of a vehicle. Cross-country airplane flights in the United States generally take longer going west than going east
because of the prevailing wind currents.

Let's take a look at a boat travelling on a river. Depending on which way the boat is going, the current of the water is
either slowing it down or speeding it up.

Figure 5.7 and Figure 5.8 show how a river current affects the speed at which a boat is actually travelling. We'll call the
speed of the boat in still water b and the speed of the river current c.

In Figure 5.7 the boat is going downstream, in the same direction as the river current. The current helps push the boat,

so the boat's actual speed is faster than its speed in still water. The actual speed at which the boat is moving is b + c.

Figure 5.7

In Figure 5.8 the boat is going upstream, opposite to the river current. The current is going against the boat, so the

boat's actual speed is slower than its speed in still water. The actual speed of the boat is  .

The ship goes downstream and then upstream.
Going downstream, the current helps the
ship; therefore, the ship's actual rate is s + c.
Going upstream, the current slows the ship;
therefore, the actual rate is s - c.

Downstream it takes 4 hours.
Upstream it takes 5 hours.
Each way the distance is 60 miles.

         In a tailwind, the wind helps the jet and so
         the rate is j + w.

Solve Mixture Applications

When we solved mixture applications with coins and tickets earlier, we started by creating a table so we could organize
the information. For a coin example with nickels and dimes, the table looked like this:

Using one variable meant that we had to relate the number of nickels and the number of dimes. We had to decide if we
were going to let n be the number of nickels and then write the number of dimes in terms of n, or if we would let d be
the number of dimes and write the number of nickels in terms of d.

Now that we know how to solve systems of equations with two variables, we'll just let n be the number of nickels and d
be the number of dimes. We'll write one equation based on the total value column, like we did before, and the other
equation will come from the number column.

For the first example, we'll do a ticket problem where the ticket prices are in whole dollars, so we won't need to use
decimals just yet.

Another application of mixture problems relates to concentrated cleaning supplies, other chemicals, and mixed drinks.
The concentration is given as a percent. For example, a 20% concentrated household cleanser means that 20% of the
total amount is cleanser, and the rest is water. To make 35 ounces of a 20% concentration, you mix 7 ounces (20% of 35)
of the cleanser with 28 ounces of water.

For these kinds of mixture problems, we'll use percent instead of value for one of the columns in our table.

Solve Interest Applications

The formula to model interest applications is I = Prt. Interest, I, is the product of the principal, P, the rate, r, and the time,
t. In our work here, we will calculate the interest earned in one year, so t will be 1.

We modify the column titles in the mixture table to show the formula for interest, as you'll see in Example 5.49.

EXAMPLE 5.49

Translate to a system of equations and solve:

Adnan has $40,000 to invest and hopes to earn 7.1% interest per year. He will put some of the money into a stock fund
that earns 8% per year and the rest into bonds that earns 3% per year. How much money should he put into each fund?

Solution

Step 1. Read the problem.                                  A chart will help us organize the information.

Step 2. Identify what we are looking for.                  We are looking for the amount to invest in each fund.

Step 3. Name what we are looking for.                      Let the amount invested in stocks.

each fund.

Did you notice that the Principal column represents the total amount of money invested while the Interest column
represents only the interest earned? Likewise, the first equation in our system, s + b = 40,000, represents the total
amount of money invested and the second equation, 0.08s + 0.03b = 0.071(40,000), represents the interest earned.

Determine Whether an Ordered Pair is a Solution of a System of Linear Inequalities

The definition of a system of linear inequalities is very similar to the definition of a system of linear equations.
  System of Linear Inequalities
  Two or more linear inequalities grouped together form a system of linear inequalities.

A system of linear inequalities looks like a system of linear equations, but it has inequalities instead of equations. A
system of two linear inequalities is shown below.

To solve a system of linear inequalities, we will find values of the variables that are solutions to both inequalities. We

solve the system by using the graphs of each inequality and show the solution as a graph. We will find the region on the

plane that contains all ordered pairs       that make both inequalities true.

  Solutions of a System of Linear Inequalities
  Solutions of a system of linear inequalities are the values of the variables that make all the inequalities true.
  The solution of a system of linear inequalities is shown as a shaded region in the x-y coordinate system that includes
  all the points whose ordered pairs make the inequalities true.

To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two inequalities, we substitute the values of the variables into
each inequality. If the ordered pair makes both inequalities true, it is a solution to the system.

  EXAMPLE 5.51

Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system.

 (-2, 4)  (3,1)

     Solution

 Is the ordered pair (-2, 4) a solution?

The ordered pair (-2, 4) made both inequalities true. Therefore (-2, 4) is a solution to this system.

 Is the ordered pair (3,1) a solution?

The ordered pair (3,1) made one inequality true, but the other one false. Therefore (3,1) is not a solution to this system.

Solve a System of Linear Inequalities by Graphing

The solution to a single linear inequality is the region on one side of the boundary line that contains all the points that
make the inequality true. The solution to a system of two linear inequalities is a region that contains the solutions to
both inequalities. To find this region, we will graph each inequality separately and then locate the region where they are
both true. The solution is always shown as a graph.

Solve Applications of Systems of Inequalities

The first thing we'll need to do to solve applications of systems of inequalities is to translate each condition into an
inequality. Then we graph the system as we did above to see the region that contains the solutions. Many situations will
be realistic only if both variables are positive, so their graphs will only show Quadrant I.

EXAMPLE 5.57

Christy sells her photographs at a booth at a street fair. At the start of the day, she wants to have at least 25 photos to
display at her booth. Each small photo she displays costs her $4 and each large photo costs her $10. She doesn't want to
spend more than $200 on photos to display.

 Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.

 Graph the system.

 Could she display 15 small and 5 large photos?

 Could she display 3 large and 22 small photos?

Solution

 Let     the number of small photos.
      the number of large photos

To find the system of inequalities, translate the information.

We have our system of inequalities.



To graph      , graph x + y = 25 as a solid line.

Choose (0, 0) as a test point. Since it does not make the inequality

true, shade the side that does not include the point (0, 0) red.

To graph                             , graph 4x + 10y = 200 as a solid line.

Choose (0, 0) as a test point. Since it does not make the inequality

true, shade the side that includes the point (0, 0) blue.

The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is double shaded and so is shaded darker.

 To determine if 10 small and 20 large photos would work, we see if the point (10, 20) is in the solution region. It is

not. Christy would not display 10 small and 20 large photos.

 To determine if 20 small and 10 large photos would work, we see if the point (20, 10) is in the solution region. It

is. Christy could choose to display 20 small and 10 large photos.
Notice that we could also test the possible solutions by substituting the values into each inequality.

EXAMPLE 5.58

Omar needs to eat at least 800 calories before going to his team practice. All he wants is hamburgers and cookies, and
he doesn't want to spend more than $5. At the hamburger restaurant near his college, each hamburger has 240 calories
and costs $1.40. Each cookie has 160 calories and costs $0.50.

 Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.  Graph the system.
 Could he eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie?  Could he eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies?

     Solution

 Let          the number of hamburgers.
           the number of cookies

To find the system of inequalities, translate the information.

The calories from hamburgers at 240 calories each, plus the calories from cookies at 160 calories each must be more

that 800.

The amount spent on hamburgers at $1.40 each, plus the amount spent on cookies at $0.50 each must be no more than
$5.00.

We have our system of inequalities.



To graph        graph                     as a solid line.

Choose (0, 0) as a test point. it does not make the inequality true.

So, shade (red) the side that does not include the point (0, 0).

To graph        , graph                   as a solid line.

Choose (0,0) as a test point. It makes the inequality true. So, shade

The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is double shaded and so is shaded darker.

 To determine if 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie would meet Omar's criteria, we see if the point (3, 1) is in the solution

region. It is. He might choose to eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie.

 To determine if 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies would meet Omar's criteria, we see if the point (2, 4) is in the solution

region. It is. He might choose to eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies.

We could also test the possible solutions by substituting the values into each inequality.

      Introduction

We have seen that the graphs of linear equations are straight lines. Graphs of other types of equations, called
polynomial equations, are curves, like the outline of this suspension bridge. Architects use polynomials to design the
shape of a bridge like this and to draw the blueprints for it. Engineers use polynomials to calculate the stress on the
bridge's supports to ensure they are strong enough for the intended load. In this chapter, you will explore operations
with and properties of polynomials.

Identify Polynomials, Monomials, Binomials and Trinomials

You have learned that a term is a constant or the product of a constant and one or more variables. When it is of the form
      , where is a constant and is a whole number, it is called a monomial. Some examples of monomial are
                                .

  Monomials

  A monomial is a term of the form , where is a constant and is a positive whole number.

A monomial, or two or more monomials combined by addition or subtraction, is a polynomial. Some polynomials have
special names, based on the number of terms. A monomial is a polynomial with exactly one term. A binomial has exactly
two terms, and a trinomial has exactly three terms. There are no special names for polynomials with more than three
terms.

  Polynomials

  polynomial--A monomial, or two or more monomials combined by addition or subtraction, is a polynomial.

    · monomial--A polynomial with exactly one term is called a monomial.
    · binomial--A polynomial with exactly two terms is called a binomial.
    · trinomial--A polynomial with exactly three terms is called a trinomial.

Here are some examples of polynomials.

Notice that every monomial, binomial, and trinomial is also a polynomial. They are just special members of the "family"
of polynomials and so they have special names. We use the words monomial, binomial, and trinomial when referring to
these special polynomials and just call all the rest polynomials.

Determine the Degree of Polynomials

The degree of a polynomial and the degree of its terms are determined by the exponents of the variable.
A monomial that has no variable, just a constant, is a special case. The degree of a constant is 0--it has no variable.

Degree of a Polynomial

The degree of a term is the sum of the exponents of its variables.
The degree of a constant is 0.
The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of all its terms.

Let's see how this works by looking at several polynomials. We'll take it step by step, starting with monomials, and then
progressing to polynomials with more terms.

A polynomial is in standard form when the terms of a polynomial are written in descending order of degrees. Get in the
habit of writing the term with the highest degree first.

Add and Subtract Monomials

You have learned how to simplify expressions by combining like terms. Remember, like terms must have the same
variables with the same exponent. Since monomials are terms, adding and subtracting monomials is the same as
combining like terms. If the monomials are like terms, we just combine them by adding or subtracting the coefficient.

Add and Subtract Polynomials

We can think of adding and subtracting polynomials as just adding and subtracting a series of monomials. Look for the
like terms--those with the same variables and the same exponent. The Commutative Property allows us to rearrange the
terms to put like terms together.

place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved?

...no - I don't get it! This is a warning sign and you must not ignore it. You should get help right away or you will quickly
be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as you can to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan
to get you the help you need.

Simplify Expressions with Exponents

Remember that an exponent indicates repeated multiplication of the same quantity. For example,  means to multiply 2

by itself 4 times, so means        .

Let's review the vocabulary for expressions with exponents.

Simplify Expressions Using the Product Property for Exponents

You have seen that when you combine like terms by adding and subtracting, you need to have the same base with the
same exponent. But when you multiply and divide, the exponents may be different, and sometimes the bases may be
different, too.

We'll derive the properties of exponents by looking for patterns in several examples.

First, we will look at an example that leads to the Product Property.
664 6 · Polynomials

  What does this mean?
  How many factors altogether?

  So, we have
  Notice that 5 is the sum of the exponents, 2 and 3.

We write:

The base stayed the same and we added the exponents. This leads to the Product Property for Exponents.

Product Property for Exponents

If is a real number, and         are counting numbers, then

To multiply with like bases, add the exponents.

An example with numbers helps to verify this property.

       Now let's look at an exponential expression that contains a power raised to a power. See if you can discover a general
       property.

         What does this mean?
         How many factors altogether?

         So we have
         Notice that 6 is the product of the exponents, 2 and 3.
       We write:

We multiplied the exponents. This leads to the Power Property for Exponents.

Multiply a Binomial by a Binomial

Just like there are different ways to represent multiplication of numbers, there are several methods that can be used to
multiply a binomial times a binomial. We will start by using the Distributive Property.

Multiply a Binomial by a Binomial Using the Distributive Property

Look at Example 6.33, where we multiplied a binomial by a monomial.

  We distributed the p to get:
  What if we have (x + 7) instead of p?

  Distribute (x + 7).
  Distribute again.
  Combine like terms.
Notice that before combining like terms, you had four terms. You multiplied the two terms of the first binomial by the
two terms of the second binomial--four multiplications.

     Solution

  Distribute (y + 8).

Multiply a Binomial by a Binomial Using the FOIL Method

Remember that when you multiply a binomial by a binomial you get four terms. Sometimes you can combine like terms
to get a trinomial, but sometimes, like in Example 6.37, there are no like terms to combine.
Let's look at the last example again and pay particular attention to how we got the four terms.

Where did the first term, , come from?

We abbreviate "First, Outer, Inner, Last" as FOIL. The letters stand for `First, Outer, Inner, Last'. The word FOIL is easy to
remember and ensures we find all four products.

Let's look at           .
  Distibutive Property         FOIL

       Notice how the terms in third line fit the FOIL pattern.
       Now we will do an example where we use the FOIL pattern to multiply two binomials.

                        HOW TO

       When you multiply by the FOIL method, drawing the lines will help your brain focus on the pattern and make it easier to
       apply.

Multiply a Binomial by a Binomial Using the Vertical Method

The FOIL method is usually the quickest method for multiplying two binomials, but it only works for binomials. You can
use the Distributive Property to find the product of any two polynomials. Another method that works for all polynomials
is the Vertical Method. It is very much like the method you use to multiply whole numbers. Look carefully at this example
of multiplying two-digit numbers.

Now we'll apply this same method to multiply two binomials.

  EXAMPLE 6.44

Multiply using the Vertical Method:
     Solution

It does not matter which binomial goes on the top.

              TRY IT 6.88 Multiply using the Vertical Method:
       We have now used three methods for multiplying binomials. Be sure to practice each method, and try to decide which
       one you prefer. The methods are listed here all together, to help you remember them.
         Multiplying Two Binomials
         To multiply binomials, use the:
           · Distributive Property
           · FOIL Method
           · Vertical Method
         Remember, FOIL only works when multiplying two binomials.

     Multiply a Trinomial by a Binomial

       We have multiplied monomials by monomials, monomials by polynomials, and binomials by binomials. Now we're ready
       to multiply a trinomial by a binomial. Remember, FOIL will not work in this case, but we can use either the Distributive
       Property or the Vertical Method. We first look at an example using the Distributive Property.

       TRY IT 6.90 Multiply using the Distributive Property:
Now let's do this same multiplication using the Vertical Method.
  EXAMPLE 6.46
Multiply using the Vertical Method:
     Solution
It is easier to put the polynomial with fewer terms on the bottom because we get fewer partial products this way.

  Multiply (2b2 - 5b + 8) by 3.

  Multiply (2b2 - 5b + 8) by b.
  Add like terms.

Square a Binomial Using the Binomial Squares Pattern

Mathematicians like to look for patterns that will make their work easier. A good example of this is squaring binomials.
While you can always get the product by writing the binomial twice and using the methods of the last section, there is
less work to do if you learn to use a pattern.

Let's start by looking at        .

What does this mean?

It means to multiply             by itself.

Then, using FOIL, we get:
Combining like terms gives:

Here's another one:

Multiply  by itself.

Using FOIL, we get:

And combining like terms:

  And one more:
  Multiply.
  Use FOIL:
  Combine like terms.
Look at these results. Do you see any patterns?
What about the number of terms? In each example we squared a binomial and the result was a trinomial.

Now look at the first term in each result. Where did it come from?

The first term is the product of the first terms of each binomial. Since the binomials are identical, it is just the square of
the first term!

To get the first term of the product, square the first term.
Where did the last term come from? Look at the examples and find the pattern.
The last term is the product of the last terms, which is the square of the last term.

To get the last term of the product, square the last term.
Finally, look at the middle term. Notice it came from adding the "outer" and the "inner" terms--which are both the
same! So the middle term is double the product of the two terms of the binomial.

To get the middle term of the product, multiply the terms and double their product.

     Multiply Conjugates Using the Product of Conjugates Pattern

       We just saw a pattern for squaring binomials that we can use to make multiplying some binomials easier. Similarly, there
       is a pattern for another product of binomials. But before we get to it, we need to introduce some vocabulary.
       What do you notice about these pairs of binomials?
       Look at the first term of each binomial in each pair.
       Notice the first terms are the same in each pair.
       Look at the last terms of each binomial in each pair.

Notice the last terms are the same in each pair.
Notice how each pair has one sum and one difference.

A pair of binomials that each have the same first term and the same last term, but one is a sum and one is a difference

has a special name. It is called a conjugate pair and is of the form              .

Conjugate Pair

A conjugate pair is two binomials of the form

The pair of binomials each have the same first term and the same last term, but one binomial is a sum and the other
is a difference.

There is a nice pattern for finding the product of conjugates. You could, of course, simply FOIL to get the product, but
using the pattern makes your work easier.

Let's look for the pattern by using FOIL to multiply some conjugate pairs.

Each first term is the product of the first terms of the binomials, and since they are identical it is the square of the first
term.

The last term came from multiplying the last terms, the square of the last term.

What do you observe about the products?

The product of the two binomials is also a binomial! Most of the products resulting from FOIL have been trinomials.

Why is there no middle term? Notice the two middle terms you get from FOIL combine to 0 in every case, the result of
one addition and one subtraction.

The product of conjugates is always of the form       . This is called a difference of squares.

This leads to the pattern:

         The product is called a difference of squares.

          It is the product of conjudgates, so the result will be the difference of two squares.

Divide a Polynomial by a Binomial

To divide a polynomial by a binomial, we follow a procedure very similar to long division of numbers. So let's look
carefully the steps we take when we divide a 3-digit number, 875, by a 2-digit number, 25.

  We write the long division
  We divide the first two digits, 87, by 25.

  We multiply 3 times 25 and write the product under the 87.

  Now we subtract 75 from 87.

  Then we bring down the third digit of the dividend, 5.

  Repeat the process, dividing 25 into 125.

We check division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor.
If we did the division correctly, the product should equal the dividend.

Now we will divide a trinomial by a binomial. As you read through the example, notice how similar the steps are to the
numerical example above.

  EXAMPLE 6.84
Find the quotient:

     Solution

  Write it as a long division problem.
  Be sure the dividend is in standard form.
  Divide x2 by x. It may help to ask yourself, "What do I need to multiply x by to get x2?"
  Put the answer, x, in the quotient over the x term.

         Subtract x2 + 5x from x2 + 9x.
         Then bring down the last term, 20.
         Divide 4x by x. It may help to ask yourself, "What do I need to
         multiply x by to get 4x?"
         Put the answer, 4, in the quotient over the constant term.

         Multiply 4 times x + 5.

         Subtract 4x + 20 from 4x + 20.

         Check:
         Multiply the quotient by the divisor.
         (x + 4)(x + 5)

  Negative Exponent
  If is an integer and  , then              .

The negative exponent tells us we can re-write the expression by taking the reciprocal of the base and then changing the
sign of the exponent.

Any expression that has negative exponents is not considered to be in simplest form. We will use the definition of a
negative exponent and other properties of exponents to write the expression with only positive exponents.

For example, if after simplifying an expression we end up with the expression , we will take one more step and write
    . The answer is considered to be in simplest form when it has only positive exponents.

Convert from Decimal Notation to Scientific Notation

Remember working with place value for whole numbers and decimals? Our number system is based on powers of 10.

We use tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on. Our decimal numbers are also based on powers of tens--tenths,

hundredths, thousandths, and so on. Consider the numbers 4,000 and    . We know that 4,000 means            and

0.004 means  .

If we write the 1000 as a power of ten in exponential form, we can rewrite these numbers in this way:

When a number is written as a product of two numbers, where the first factor is a number greater than or equal to one
but less than 10, and the second factor is a power of 10 written in exponential form, it is said to be in scientific notation.

     HOW TO

Convert from decimal notation to scientific notation

Step 1.  Move the decimal point so that the first factor is greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10.
Step 2.
Step 3.  Count the number of decimal places, n, that the decimal point was moved.

         Write the number as a product with a power of 10.

         If the original number is:
           greater than 1, the power of 10 will be 10n.
           between 0 and 1, the power of 10 will be 10-n.

Step 4. Check.

EXAMPLE 6.102

Write in scientific notation:

     Solution                  , is between 0 and 1 so we will have a negative power of 10.

     Multiply and Divide Using Scientific Notation

       Astronomers use very large numbers to describe distances in the universe and ages of stars and planets. Chemists use
       very small numbers to describe the size of an atom or the charge on an electron. When scientists perform calculations
       with very large or very small numbers, they use scientific notation. Scientific notation provides a way for the calculations

    Find the Greatest Common Factor of Two or More Expressions

       Earlier we multiplied factors together to get a product. Now, we will be reversing this process; we will start with a
       product and then break it down into its factors. Splitting a product into factors is called factoring.

       We have learned how to factor numbers to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers. Now we will
       factor expressions and find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions. The method we use is similar to
       what we used to find the LCM.

         Greatest Common Factor
         The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more expressions is the largest expression that is a factor of all the
         expressions.
       First we'll find the GCF of two numbers.
         EXAMPLE 7.1

Factor the Greatest Common Factor from a Polynomial

Just like in arithmetic, where it is sometimes useful to represent a number in factored form (for example, 12 as
                   in algebra, it can be useful to represent a polynomial in factored form. One way to do this is by finding the

GCF of all the terms. Remember, we multiply a polynomial by a monomial as follows:

Now we will start with a product, like        , and end with its factors,  . To do this we apply the Distributive
Property "in reverse."

We state the Distributive Property here just as you saw it in earlier chapters and "in reverse."

Distributive Property

If       are real numbers, then

The form on the left is used to multiply. The form on the right is used to factor.

So how do you use the Distributive Property to factor a polynomial? You just find the GCF of all the terms and write the
polynomial as a product!

Factor by Grouping

When there is no common factor of all the terms of a polynomial, look for a common factor in just some of the terms.
When there are four terms, a good way to start is by separating the polynomial into two parts with two terms in each
part. Then look for the GCF in each part. If the polynomial can be factored, you will find a common factor emerges from
both parts.

(Not all polynomials can be factored. Just like some numbers are prime, some polynomials are prime.)

Factor Trinomials of the Form x2 + bx + c

You have already learned how to multiply binomials using FOIL. Now you'll need to "undo" this multiplication--to start
with the product and end up with the factors. Let's look at an example of multiplying binomials to refresh your memory.

To factor the trinomial means to start with the product,            , and end with the factors,  . You need

to think about where each of the terms in the trinomial came from.

The first term came from multiplying the first term in each binomial. So to get  in the product, each binomial must
start with an x.

The last term in the trinomial came from multiplying the last term in each binomial. So the last terms must multiply to 6.
What two numbers multiply to 6?
The factors of 6 could be 1 and 6, or 2 and 3. How do you know which pair to use?
Consider the middle term. It came from adding the outer and inner terms.
So the numbers that must have a product of 6 will need a sum of 5. We'll test both possibilities and summarize the
results in Table 7.1--the table will be very helpful when you work with numbers that can be factored in many different
ways.

                                                                Factors of Sum of factors

Factor Trinomials of the Form x2 + bx + c with b Negative, c Positive

In the examples so far, all terms in the trinomial were positive. What happens when there are negative terms? Well, it
depends which term is negative. Let's look first at trinomials with only the middle term negative.

Remember: To get a negative sum and a positive product, the numbers must both be negative.

Again, think about FOIL and where each term in the trinomial came from. Just as before,

  · the first term, , comes from the product of the two first terms in each binomial factor, x and y;
  · the positive last term is the product of the two last terms
  · the negative middle term is the sum of the outer and inner terms.

How do you get a positive product and a negative sum? With two negative numbers.

Now, what if the last term in the trinomial is negative? Think about FOIL. The last term is the product of the last terms in

the two binomials. A negative product results from multiplying two numbers with opposite signs. You have to be very

careful to choose factors to make sure you get the correct sign for the middle term, too.

Remember: To get a negative product, the numbers must have different signs.

Recognize a Preliminary Strategy for Factoring

Let's summarize where we are so far with factoring polynomials. In the first two sections of this chapter, we used three
methods of factoring: factoring the GCF, factoring by grouping, and factoring a trinomial by "undoing" FOIL. More
methods will follow as you continue in this chapter, as well as later in your studies of algebra.

How will you know when to use each factoring method? As you learn more methods of factoring, how will you know
when to apply each method and not get them confused? It will help to organize the factoring methods into a strategy
that can guide you to use the correct method.

As you start to factor a polynomial, always ask first, "Is there a greatest common factor?" If there is, factor it first.

The next thing to consider is the type of polynomial. How many terms does it have? Is it a binomial? A trinomial? Or does
it have more than three terms?

If it is a trinomial where the leading coefficient is one,        , use the "undo FOIL" method.

If it has more than three terms, try the grouping method. This is the only method to use for polynomials of more than
three terms.

Some polynomials cannot be factored. They are called "prime."

Below we summarize the methods we have so far. These are detailed in Choose a strategy to factor polynomials
completely.

           ...

              HOW TO

Choose a strategy to factor polynomials completely.
Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor?

              Factor it out.
Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
784 7 · Factoring

                    If it is a binomial, right now we have no method to factor it.

                    If it is a trinomial of the form    : Undo FOIL

                    If it has more than three terms: Use the grouping method.

Step 3. Check by multiplying the factors.

Use the preliminary strategy to completely factor a polynomial. A polynomial is factored completely if, other than
monomials, all of its factors are prime.

Factor Trinomials of the form ax2 + bx + c with a GCF

Now that we have organized what we've covered so far, we are ready to factor trinomials whose leading coefficient is not

1, trinomials of the form            .

Remember to always check for a GCF first! Sometimes, after you factor the GCF, the leading coefficient of the trinomial
becomes 1 and you can factor it by the methods in the last section. Let's do a few examples to see how this works.

Watch out for the signs in the next two examples.

Factor Trinomials using Trial and Error

What happens when the leading coefficient is not 1 and there is no GCF? There are several methods that can be used to
factor these trinomials. First we will use the Trial and Error method.

Let's factor the trinomial     .

From our earlier work we expect this will factor into two binomials.

We know the first terms of the binomial factors will multiply to give us . The only factors of are  . We can
place them in the binomials.

Check. Does                 ?

We know the last terms of the binomials will multiply to 2. Since this trinomial has all positive terms, we only need to
consider positive factors. The only factors of 2 are 1 and 2. But we now have two cases to consider as it will make a
difference if we write 1, 2, or 2, 1.

Which factors are correct? To decide that, we multiply the inner and outer terms.

Since the middle term of the trinomial is 5x, the factors in the first case will work. Let's FOIL to check.
Our result of the factoring is:

     HOW TO

Factor trinomials of the form              using trial and error.

Step 1.  Write the trinomial in descending order of degrees.
Step 2.  Find all the factor pairs of the first term.
Step 3.  Find all the factor pairs of the third term.
Step 4.  Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found.
Step 5.  Check by multiplying.

When the middle term is negative and the last term is positive, the signs in the binomials must both be negative.

EXAMPLE 7.34

Factor completely:             .

Solution

The trinomial is already in descending order.

Find the factors of the first term.

Find the factors of the last term. Consider the signs. Since the last term, 5 is positive its factors
must both be positive or both be negative. The coefficient of the middle term is negative, so we
use the negative factors.

Consider all the combinations of factors.

greatest common factor, there cannot be one in its factors either. This may help us eliminate some of the possible factor
combinations.

The strategy for factoring we developed in the last section will guide you as you factor most binomials, trinomials, and
polynomials with more than three terms. We have seen that some binomials and trinomials result from special
products--squaring binomials and multiplying conjugates. If you learn to recognize these kinds of polynomials, you can
use the special products patterns to factor them much more quickly.

Factor Perfect Square Trinomials

Some trinomials are perfect squares. They result from multiplying a binomial times itself. You can square a binomial by
using FOIL, but using the Binomial Squares pattern you saw in a previous chapter saves you a step. Let's review the
Binomial Squares pattern by squaring a binomial using FOIL.

The first term is the square of the first term of the binomial and the last term is the square of the last. The middle term is
twice the product of the two terms of the binomial.

The trinomial 9x2 + 24 +16 is called a perfect square trinomial. It is the square of the binomial 3x+4.
We'll repeat the Binomial Squares Pattern here to use as a reference in factoring.

When you square a binomial, the product is a perfect square trinomial. In this chapter, you are learning to factor--now,
you will start with a perfect square trinomial and factor it into its prime factors.
You could factor this trinomial using the methods described in the last section, since it is of the form ax2 + bx + c. But if
you recognize that the first and last terms are squares and the trinomial fits the perfect square trinomials pattern, you
will save yourself a lot of work.
Here is the pattern--the reverse of the binomial squares pattern.

  Perfect Square Trinomials Pattern

  If a and b are real numbers,

To make use of this pattern, you have to recognize that a given trinomial fits it. Check first to see if the leading coefficient
is a perfect square, . Next check that the last term is a perfect square, . Then check the middle term--is it twice the
product, 2ab? If everything checks, you can easily write the factors.

three terms and it should be factored out first. And, sometimes, once the GCF has been factored, you will recognize a
perfect square trinomial.

Factor Differences of Squares

The other special product you saw in the previous chapter was the Product of Conjugates pattern. You used this to
multiply two binomials that were conjugates. Here's an example:

Remember, when you multiply conjugate binomials, the middle terms of the product add to 0. All you have left is a
binomial, the difference of squares.
Multiplying conjugates is the only way to get a binomial from the product of two binomials.

  Product of Conjugates Pattern
  If a and b are real numbers

  The product is called a difference of squares.

To factor, we will use the product pattern "in reverse" to factor the difference of squares. A difference of squares factors
to a product of conjugates.

  Difference of Squares Pattern
  If a and b are real numbers,

Remember, "difference" refers to subtraction. So, to use this pattern you must make sure you have a binomial in which
two squares are being subtracted.

     HOW TO

Factor polynomials.

Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor?
              Factor it out.

Step 2.  Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
           If it is a binomial:

               Is it a sum?
           Of squares? Sums of squares do not factor.
           Of cubes? Use the sum of cubes pattern.

                       Is it a difference?
                    Of squares? Factor as the product of conjugates.
                    Of cubes? Use the difference of cubes pattern.

          Is it of the form             ?

 If and are squares, check if it fits the trinomial square pattern.

 Use the trial and error or "ac" method.

 If it has more than three terms:
    Use the grouping method.

Step 3. Check.
              Is it factored completely?
              Do the factors multiply back to the original polynomial?

Remember, a polynomial is completely factored if, other than monomials, its factors are prime!

We have already solved linear equations, equations of the form                . In linear equations, the variables have no

exponents. Quadratic equations are equations in which the variable is squared. Listed below are some examples of

quadratic equations:

The last equation doesn't appear to have the variable squared, but when we simplify the expression on the left we will

get     .

The general form of a quadratic equation is                               .

Quadratic Equation

An equation of the form                      is called a quadratic equation.

To solve quadratic equations we need methods different than the ones we used in solving linear equations. We will look
at one method here and then several others in a later chapter.

Solve Quadratic Equations Using the Zero Product Property

We will first solve some quadratic equations by using the Zero Product Property. The Zero Product Property says that if
the product of two quantities is zero, it must be that at least one of the quantities is zero. The only way to get a product
equal to zero is to multiply by zero itself.

Zero Product Property

If                 , then either     or      or both.

We will now use the Zero Product Property, to solve a quadratic equation.

Solve Quadratic Equations by Factoring

Each of the equations we have solved in this section so far had one side in factored form. In order to use the Zero

Product Property, the quadratic equation must be factored, with zero on one side. So we must be sure to start with the

quadratic equation in standard form,            . Then we can factor the expression on the left.

      Introduction

Like rowing a boat, riding a bicycle is a situation in which going in one direction, downhill, is easy, but going in the
opposite direction, uphill, can be more work. The trip to reach a destination may be quick, but the return trip whether
upstream or uphill will take longer.

Rational equations are used to model situations like these. In this chapter, we will work with rational expressions, solve
rational equations, and use them to solve problems in a variety of applications.

In Chapter 1, we reviewed the properties of fractions and their operations. We introduced rational numbers, which are
just fractions where the numerators and denominators are integers, and the denominator is not zero.
In this chapter, we will work with fractions whose numerators and denominators are polynomials. We call these rational
expressions.

  Rational Expression

A rational expression is an expression of the form       where p and q are polynomials and

Remember, division by 0 is undefined.
Here are some examples of rational expressions:

Notice that the first rational expression listed above,  is just a fraction. Since a constant is a polynomial with degree

zero, the ratio of two constants is a rational expression, provided the denominator is not zero.

We will perform the same operations with rational expressions that we do with fractions. We will simplify, add, subtract,
multiply, divide, and use them in applications.

Determine the Values for Which a Rational Expression is Undefined

When we work with a numerical fraction, it is easy to avoid dividing by zero, because we can see the number in the
denominator. In order to avoid dividing by zero in a rational expression, we must not allow values of the variable that will
make the denominator be zero.

If the denominator is zero, the rational expression is undefined. The numerator of a rational expression may be 0--but
not the denominator.

So before we begin any operation with a rational expression, we examine it first to find the values that would make the
denominator zero. That way, when we solve a rational equation for example, we will know whether the algebraic
solutions we find are allowed or not.

             ...

                 HOW TO

  Determine the Values for Which a Rational Expression is Undefined.

  Step 1. Set the denominator equal to zero.
  Step 2. Solve the equation in the set of reals, if possible.

Simplify Rational Expressions

Just like a fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and
denominator, a rational expression is simplified if it has no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and
denominator.

Simplified Rational Expression

A rational expression is considered simplified if there are no common factors in its numerator and denominator.

For example:
  · is simplified because there are no common factors of 2 and 3.
854 8 · Rational Expressions and Equations

·  is not simplified because x is a common factor of 2x and 3x.

We use the Equivalent Fractions Property to simplify numerical fractions. We restate it here as we will also use it to
simplify rational expressions.

Equivalent Fractions Property

If a, b, and c are numbers where            , then             and  .

Notice that in the Equivalent Fractions Property, the values that would make the denominators zero are specifically

disallowed. We see                clearly stated. Every time we write a rational expression, we should make a similar

statement disallowing values that would make a denominator zero. However, to let us focus on the work at hand, we will

omit writing it in the examples.

Let's start by reviewing how we simplify numerical fractions.

To simplify rational expressions we first write the numerator and denominator in factored form. Then we remove the
common factors using the Equivalent Fractions Property.
Be very careful as you remove common factors. Factors are multiplied to make a product. You can remove a factor from
a product. You cannot remove a term from a sum.

Note that removing the x's from     would be like cancelling the 2's in the fraction !

Simplify Rational Expressions with Opposite Factors

Now we will see how to simplify a rational expression whose numerator and denominator have opposite factors. Let's
start with a numerical fraction, say . We know this fraction simplifies to . We also recognize that the numerator and
denominator are opposites.

In Foundations, we introduced opposite notation: the opposite of is . We remember, too, that          .

We simplify the fraction , whose numerator and denominator are opposites, in this way:

So, in the same way, we can simplify the fraction       :

But the opposite of      could be written differently:

This means the fraction  simplifies to .

In general, we could write the opposite of  as          . So the rational expression simplifies to .

do, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. If they do not have a common
denominator, you find one before you add.

It is the same with rational expressions. To add rational expressions, they must have a common denominator. When the

Find the Least Common Denominator of Rational Expressions

When we add or subtract rational expressions with unlike denominators we will need to get common denominators. If
we review the procedure we used with numerical fractions, we will know what to do with rational expressions.

Let's look at the example                   from Foundations. Since the denominators are not the same, the first step was to find

the least common denominator (LCD). Remember, the LCD is the least common multiple of the denominators. It is the
smallest number we can use as a common denominator.

To find the LCD of 12 and 18, we factored each number into primes, lining up any common primes in columns. Then we
"brought down" one prime from each column. Finally, we multiplied the factors to find the LCD.

We do the same thing for rational expressions. However, we leave the LCD in factored form.

             ...

                 HOW TO

  Find the least common denominator of rational expressions.
  Step 1. Factor each expression completely.
  Step 2. List the factors of each expression. Match factors vertically when possible.

Step 3. Bring down the columns.
Step 4. Multiply the factors.

Remember, we always exclude values that would make the denominator zero. What values of x should we exclude in
this next example?

Solution

Factor each expression completely, lining

Find Equivalent Rational Expressions

When we add numerical fractions, once we find the LCD, we rewrite each fraction as an equivalent fraction with the LCD.

We will do the same thing for rational expressions.

Rewrite as equivalent rational expressions with denominator     :

Solution

Complex fractions are fractions in which the numerator or denominator contains a fraction. In Chapter 1 we simplified
complex fractions like these:

In this section we will simplify complex rational expressions, which are rational expressions with rational expressions in
the numerator or denominator.

  Complex Rational Expression

  A complex rational expression is a rational expression in which the numerator or denominator contains a rational
  expression.

Here are a few complex rational expressions:

Remember, we always exclude values that would make any denominator zero.
We will use two methods to simplify complex rational expressions.

Simplify a Complex Rational Expression by Writing it as Division

We have already seen this complex rational expression earlier in this chapter.

We noted that fraction bars tell us to divide, so rewrote it as the division problem

Then we multiplied the first rational expression by the reciprocal of the second, just like we do when we divide two
fractions.
This is one method to simplify rational expressions. We write it as if we were dividing two fractions.

  EXAMPLE 8.50

Simplify:

reciprocal of the second.

Are there any value(s) of that should not be allowed? The simplified rational expression has just a constant in the

denominator. But the original complex rational expression had denominators of  and  . This expression would

be undefined if  or              .

Simplify a Complex Rational Expression by Using the LCD

We "cleared" the fractions by multiplying by the LCD when we solved equations with fractions. We can use that strategy
here to simplify complex rational expressions. We will multiply the numerator and denominator by LCD of all the rational
expressions.

Let's look at the complex rational expression we simplified one way in Example 8.51. We will simplify it here by

multiplying the numerator and denominator by the LCD. When we multiply by       we are multiplying by 1, so the value

stays the same.

After defining the terms expression and equation early in Foundations, we have used them throughout this book. We
have simplified many kinds of expressions and solved many kinds of equations. We have simplified many rational
expressions so far in this chapter. Now we will solve rational equations.
The definition of a rational equation is similar to the definition of equation we used in Foundations.

  Rational Equation

  A rational equation is two rational expressions connected by an equal sign.

You must make sure to know the difference between rational expressions and rational equations. The equation contains
an equal sign.

Solve Rational Equations

We have already solved linear equations that contained fractions. We found the LCD of all the fractions in the equation
and then multiplied both sides of the equation by the LCD to "clear" the fractions.

                                                                                 8.6 · Solve Rational Equations 907

Here is an example we did when we worked with linear equations:

We multiplied both sides by the LCD.
Then we distributed.
We simplified--and then we had an equation with no fractions.
Finally, we solved that equation.

We will use the same strategy to solve rational equations. We will multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. Then
we will have an equation that does not contain rational expressions and thus is much easier for us to solve.
But because the original equation may have a variable in a denominator we must be careful that we don't end up with a
solution that would make a denominator equal to zero.
So before we begin solving a rational equation, we examine it first to find the values that would make any denominators
zero. That way, when we solve a rational equation we will know if there are any algebraic solutions we must discard.
An algebraic solution to a rational equation that would cause any of the rational expressions to be undefined is called an
extraneous solution.

  Extraneous Solution to a Rational Equation

  An extraneous solution to a rational equation is an algebraic solution that would cause any of the expressions in
  the original equation to be undefined.

We note any possible extraneous solutions, c, by writing  next to the equation.

Solve a Rational Equation for a Specific Variable

When we solved linear equations, we learned how to solve a formula for a specific variable. Many formulas used in
business, science, economics, and other fields use rational equations to model the relation between two or more
variables. We will now see how to solve a rational equation for a specific variable.
We'll start with a formula relating distance, rate, and time. We have used it many times before, but not usually in this
form.

Solve Proportions

When two rational expressions are equal, the equation relating them is called a proportion.

Proportion

A proportion is an equation of the form       , where  .

The proportion is read " is to , as is to ."

The equation  is a proportion because the two fractions are equal. The proportion            is read "1 is to 2 as 4 is
to 8."

Proportions are used in many applications to `scale up' quantities. We'll start with a very simple example so you can see
how proportions work. Even if you can figure out the answer to the example right away, make sure you also learn to
solve it using proportions.

Suppose a school principal wants to have 1 teacher for 20 students. She could use proportions to find the number of
teachers for 60 students. We let x be the number of teachers for 60 students and then set up the proportion:

We are careful to match the units of the numerators and the units of the denominators--teachers in the numerators,
students in the denominators.
Since a proportion is an equation with rational expressions, we will solve proportions the same way we solved equations
in Solve Rational Equations. We'll multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to clear the fractions and then solve the

So let's finish solving the principal's problem now. We will omit writing the units until the last step.

Multiply both sides by the LCD, 60.

Simplify.

                                     The principal needs 3 teachers for 60 students.

Now we'll do a few examples of solving numerical proportions without any units. Then we will solve applications using

TRY IT 8.153  Yurianna is going to Europe and wants to change $800 dollars into Euros. At the current
              exchange rate, $1 US is equal to 0.738 Euro. How many Euros will she have for her trip?

TRY IT 8.154  Corey and Nicole are traveling to Japan and need to exchange $600 into Japanese yen. If each
              dollar is 94.1 yen, how many yen will they get?

In the example above, we related the number of pesos to the number of dollars by using a proportion. We could say the
number of pesos is proportional to the number of dollars. If two quantities are related by a proportion, we say that they
are proportional.

Solve Similar Figure Applications

When you shrink or enlarge a photo on a phone or tablet, figure out a distance on a map, or use a pattern to build a
bookcase or sew a dress, you are working with similar figures. If two figures have exactly the same shape, but different
sizes, they are said to be similar. One is a scale model of the other. All their corresponding angles have the same
measures and their corresponding sides are in the same ratio.

  Similar Figures

  Two figures are similar if the measures of their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are in
  the same ratio.

For example, the two triangles in Figure 8.2 are similar. Each side of  is 4 times the length of the corresponding

side of  .

Solve Work Applications

Suppose Pete can paint a room in 10 hours. If he works at a steady pace, in 1 hour he would paint of the room. If
Alicia would take 8 hours to paint the same room, then in 1 hour she would paint of the room. How long would it take
Pete and Alicia to paint the room if they worked together (and didn't interfere with each other's progress)?

This is a typical `work' application. There are three quantities involved here - the time it would take each of the two
people to do the job alone and the time it would take for them to do the job together.

Let's get back to Pete and Alicia painting the room. We will let t be the number of hours it would take them to paint the
room together. So in 1 hour working together they have completed of the job.

In one hour Pete did of the job. Alicia did of the job. And together they did of the job.

We can model this with the word equation and then translate to a rational equation. To find the time it would take them
if they worked together, we solve for t.

relation is to talk about the variation of the two quantities. We will discuss direct variation and inverse variation in this
section.

Solve Direct Variation Problems

Lindsay gets paid $15 per hour at her job. If we let s be her salary and h be the number of hours she has worked, we
could model this situation with the equation

Lindsay's salary is the product of a constant, 15, and the number of hours she works. We say that Lindsay's salary varies
directly with the number of hours she works. Two variables vary directly if one is the product of a constant and the other.

  Direct Variation

  For any two variables x and y, y varies directly with x if

The constant k is called the constant of variation.

In applications using direct variation, generally we will know values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find
the equation that relates x and y. Then we can use that equation to find values of y for other values of x.

      Introduction

Suppose a stone falls from the edge of a cliff. The number of feet the stone has dropped after seconds can be found by
multiplying 16 times the square of . But to calculate the number of seconds it would take the stone to hit the land
below, we need to use a square root. In this chapter, we will introduce and apply the properties of square roots, and
extend these concepts to higher order roots and rational exponents.

Simplify Expressions with Square Roots

Remember that when a number is multiplied by itself, we write           and read it "n squared." For example,        reads as

"15 squared," and 225 is called the square of 15, since            .

Square of a Number

If        , then is the square of .

Sometimes we will need to look at the relationship between numbers and their squares in reverse. Because 225 is the
square of 15, we can also say that 15 is a square root of 225. A number whose square is is called a square root of .

  Square Root of a Number

If        , then is a square root of .

Notice                      also, so is also a square root of 225. Therefore, both 15 and are square roots of 225.

So, every positive number has two square roots--one positive and one negative. What if we only wanted the positive
square root of a positive number? The radical sign, , denotes the positive square root. The positive square root is also
called the principal square root.

We also use the radical sign for the square root of zero. Because       ,  . Notice that zero has only one square

root.

Square Root Notation

       is read as "the square root of ."

If        , then                 , for    .

The square root of , , is the positive number whose square is .

Since 15 is the positive square root of 225, we write          . Fill in Figure 9.2 to make a table of square roots you can
refer to as you work this chapter.

                                                            Figure 9.2

We know that every positive number has two square roots and the radical sign indicates the positive one. We write

          . If we want to find the negative square root of a number, we place a negative in front of the radical sign. For

example,                      .

Approximate Square Roots

There are mathematical methods to approximate square roots, but nowadays most people use a calculator to find them.
Find the key on your calculator. You will use this key to approximate square roots.

When you use your calculator to find the square root of a number that is not a perfect square, the answer that you see is
not the exact square root. It is an approximation, accurate to the number of digits shown on your calculator's display.
The symbol for an approximation is and it is read `approximately.'

Suppose your calculator has a 10-digit display. You would see that

If we wanted to round to two decimal places, we would say

How do we know these values are approximations and not the exact values? Look at what happens when we square
them:

Simplify Variable Expressions with Square Roots                                   . Can you think of an expression

What if we have to find a square root of an expression with a variable? Consider
whose square is ?

When we use the radical sign to take the square root of a variable expression, we should specify that   to make sure
we get the principal square root.

However, in this chapter we will assume that each variable in a square-root expression represents a non-negative

number and so we will not write  next to every radical.

What about square roots of higher powers of variables? Think about the Power Property of Exponents we used in
Chapter 6.

If we square , the exponent will become .

In the last section, we estimated the square root of a number between two consecutive whole numbers. We can say that
       is between 7 and 8. This is fairly easy to do when the numbers are small enough that we can use Figure 9.2.

But what if we want to estimate   ? If we simplify the square root first, we'll be able to estimate it easily. There are

other reasons, too, to simplify square roots as you'll see later in this chapter.

A square root is considered simplified if its radicand contains no perfect square factors.

Simplified Square Root

      is considered simplified if has no perfect square factors.

So    is simplified. But  is not simplified, because 16 is a perfect square factor of 32.

Use the Product Property to Simplify Square Roots

The properties we will use to simplify expressions with square roots are similar to the properties of exponents. We know

that  . The corresponding property of square roots says that                                .

Product Property of Square Roots

If a, b are non-negative real numbers, then  .

We use the Product Property of Square Roots to remove all perfect square factors from a radical. We will show how to do
this in Example 9.12.

We have seen how to use the Order of Operations to simplify some expressions with radicals. To simplify
we must simplify each square root separately first, then add to get the sum of 17.

The expression                   cannot be simplified--to begin we'd need to simplify each square root, but neither 17 nor 7

contains a perfect square factor.

In the next example, we have the sum of an integer and a square root. We simplify the square root but cannot add the
resulting expression to the integer.

denominator to the power separately.

We can use a similar property to simplify a square root of a fraction. After removing all common factors from the
numerator and denominator, if the fraction is not a perfect square we simplify the numerator and denominator
separately.

Trying to add square roots with different radicands is like trying to add unlike terms.

Adding square roots with the same radicand is just like adding like terms. We call square roots with the same radicand
like square roots to remind us they work the same as like terms.

  Like Square Roots

  Square roots with the same radicand are called like square roots.

We add and subtract like square roots in the same way we add and subtract like terms. We know that  is .

Multiply Square Roots

We have used the Product Property of Square Roots to simplify square roots by removing the perfect square factors. The
Product Property of Square Roots says

We can use the Product Property of Square Roots `in reverse' to multiply square roots.

Remember, we assume all variables are greater than or equal to zero.
We will rewrite the Product Property of Square Roots so we see both ways together.

  Product Property of Square Roots
  If a, b are nonnegative real numbers, then

So we can multiply  in this way:

Sometimes the product gives us a perfect square:
1000 9 · Roots and Radicals

Even when the product is not a perfect square, we must look for perfect-square factors and simplify the radical whenever
possible.

Multiplying radicals with coefficients is much like multiplying variables with coefficients. To multiply  we multiply

the coefficients together and then the variables. The result is  . Keep this in mind as you do these examples.

Rationalize a One Term Denominator

Before the calculator became a tool of everyday life, tables of square roots were used to find approximate values of
square roots. Figure 9.3 shows a portion of a table of squares and square roots. Square roots are approximated to five
decimal places in this table.

  Figure 9.3 A table of square roots was used to find approximate values of square roots before there were calculators.
If someone needed to approximate a fraction with a square root in the denominator, it meant doing long division with a
five decimal-place divisor. This was a very cumbersome process.
For this reason, a process called rationalizing the denominator was developed. A fraction with a radical in the
denominator is converted to an equivalent fraction whose denominator is an integer. This process is still used today and
is useful in other areas of mathematics, too.

  Rationalizing the Denominator

  The process of converting a fraction with a radical in the denominator to an equivalent fraction whose denominator is
  an integer is called rationalizing the denominator.

Square roots of numbers that are not perfect squares are irrational numbers. When we rationalize the denominator,
we write an equivalent fraction with a rational number in the denominator.
Let's look at a numerical example.
1018 9 · Roots and Radicals

        But we can find a fraction equivalent to by multiplying the numerator and denominator by .

Now if we need an approximate value, we divide          . This is much easier.

Even though we have calculators available nearly everywhere, a fraction with a radical in the denominator still must be
rationalized. It is not considered simplified if the denominator contains a square root.

Similarly, a square root is not considered simplified if the radicand contains a fraction.

Simplified Square Roots

A square root is considered simplified if there are

  · no perfect-square factors in the radicand
  · no fractions in the radicand
  · no square roots in the denominator of a fraction

To rationalize a denominator, we use the property that  . If we square an irrational square root, we get a
rational number.

We will use this property to rationalize the denominator in the next example.

EXAMPLE 9.66

Simplify: .

     Solution
To rationalize a denominator, we can multiply a square root by itself. To keep the fraction equivalent, we multiply both
the numerator and denominator by the same factor.

Solve Radical Equations

In this section we will solve equations that have the variable in the radicand of a square root. Equations of this type are
called radical equations.
1026 9 · Roots and Radicals

Radical Equation
An equation in which the variable is in the radicand of a square root is called a radical equation.

As usual, in solving these equations, what we do to one side of an equation we must do to the other side as well. Since
squaring a quantity and taking a square root are `opposite' operations, we will square both sides in order to remove the
radical sign and solve for the variable inside.

But remember that when we write we mean the principal square root. So  always. When we solve radical

equations by squaring both sides we may get an algebraic solution that would make negative. This algebraic

solution would not be a solution to the original radical equation; it is an extraneous solution. We saw extraneous
solutions when we solved rational equations, too.

EXAMPLE 9.74

For the equation                 :

Simplify Expressions with Higher Roots

Up to now, in this chapter we have worked with squares and square roots. We will now extend our work to include
higher powers and higher roots.

Let's review some vocabulary first.
1042 9 · Roots and Radicals

The terms `squared' and `cubed' come from the formulas for area of a square and volume of a cube.

It will be helpful to have a table of the powers of the integers from  . See Figure 9.4.

                                          Figure 9.4 First through fifth powers of integers from to

Notice the signs in Figure 9.4. All powers of positive numbers are positive, of course. But when we have a negative
number, the even powers are positive and the odd powers are negative. We'll copy the row with the powers of below
to help you see this.

Earlier in this chapter we defined the square root of a number.

And we have used the notation to denote the principal square root. So  always.
We will now extend the definition to higher roots.

nth Root of a Number

If     , then is an nth root of a number .

The principal nth root of is written .

       n is called the index of the radical.

We do not write the index for a square root. Just like we use the word `cubed' for , we use the term `cube root' for .
We refer to Figure 9.4 to help us find higher roots.

Could we have an even root of a negative number? No. We know that the square root of a negative number is not a real
number. The same is true for any even root. Even roots of negative numbers are not real numbers. Odd roots of negative
numbers are real numbers.

When we worked with square roots that had variables in the radicand, we restricted the variables to non-negative values.
Now we will remove this restriction.

The odd root of a number can be either positive or negative. We have seen that  .

But the even root of a non-negative number is always non-negative, because we take the principal nth root.

Suppose we start with             .

How can we make sure the fourth root of -5 raised to the fourth power,     is 5? We will see in the following property.

We must use the absolute value signs when we take an even root of an expression with a variable in the radical.

like radicals.

  Like Radicals

  Radicals with the same index and same radicand are called like radicals.

Simplify Expressions with

Rational exponents are another way of writing expressions with radicals. When we use rational exponents, we can
apply the properties of exponents to simplify expressions.

The Power Property for Exponents says that               when m and n are whole numbers. Let's assume we are now
not limited to whole numbers.

Suppose we want to find a number p such that             . We will use the Power Property of Exponents to find the value
of p.

Multiply the exponents on the left.
Write the exponent 1 on the right.
The exponents must be equal.

· Every positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. The positive square root of a positive

number is the principal square root.

· We can estimate square roots using nearby perfect squares.

· We can approximate square roots using a calculator.

· When we use the radical sign to take the square root of a variable expression, we should specify that  to make

sure we get the principal square root.

      Introduction

The trajectories of fireworks are modeled by quadratic equations. The equations can be used to predict the maximum
height of a firework and the number of seconds it will take from launch to explosion. In this chapter, we will study the
properties of quadratic equations, solve them, graph them, and see how they are applied as models of various
situations.

Quadratic equations are equations of the form           , where  . They differ from linear equations by
1086 10 · Quadratic Equations

including a term with the variable raised to the second power. We use different methods to solve quadratic equations
than linear equations, because just adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing terms will not isolate the variable.

We have seen that some quadratic equations can be solved by factoring. In this chapter, we will use three other methods
to solve quadratic equations.

Solve Quadratic Equations of the Form ax2 = k Using the Square Root Property

We have already solved some quadratic equations by factoring. Let's review how we used factoring to solve the quadratic

equation            .

We can easily use factoring to find the solutions of similar equations, like  and        , because 16 and 25 are

perfect squares. But what happens when we have an equation like               ? Since 7 is not a perfect square, we cannot

solve the equation by factoring.

These equations are all of the form      .

We defined the square root of a number in this way:

This leads to the Square Root Property.

If        , and                , then       .

Notice that the Square Root Property gives two solutions to an equation of the form      : the principal square root of

and its opposite. We could also write the solution as  .

Now, we will solve the equation        again, this time using the Square Root Property.

What happens when the constant is not a perfect square? Let's use the Square Root Property to solve the equation

So far, we have solved quadratic equations by factoring and using the Square Root Property. In this section, we will solve
quadratic equations by a process called `completing the square.'

Complete The Square of a Binomial Expression

In the last section, we were able to use the Square Root Property to solve the equation  because the left
side was a perfect square.

We also solved an equation in which the left side was a perfect square trinomial, but we had to rewrite it the form
            in order to use the square root property.

What happens if the variable is not part of a perfect square? Can we use algebra to make a perfect square?
Let's study the binomial square pattern we have used many times. We will look at two examples.
1098 10 · Quadratic Equations

          Binomial Squares Pattern
          If are real numbers,

We can use this pattern to "make" a perfect square.

We will start with the expression        . Since there is a plus sign between the two terms, we will use the
pattern.

Notice that the first term of       is a square, .
                                     to make a perfect square trinomial?
We now know  .

What number can we add to

The middle term of the Binomial Squares Pattern, , is twice the product of the two terms of the binomial. This means
twice the product of and some number is . So, two times some number must be six. The number we need is

              The second term in the binomial, must be 3.

We now know  .

Now, we just square the second term of the binomial to get the last term of the perfect square trinomial, so we square
three to get the last term, nine.

We can now factor to

So, we found that adding nine to         `completes the square,' and we write it as  .

Solve Quadratic Equations of the Form x2 + bx + c = 0 by completing the square

In solving equations, we must always do the same thing to both sides of the equation. This is true, of course, when we
solve a quadratic equation by completing the square, too. When we add a term to one side of the equation to make a
perfect square trinomial, we must also add the same term to the other side of the equation.

For example, if we start with the equation              and we want to complete the square on the left, we will add nine
to both sides of the equation.

Then, we factor on the left and simplify on the right.

Use the Discriminant to Predict the Number of Solutions of a Quadratic Equation

When we solved the quadratic equations in the previous examples, sometimes we got two solutions, sometimes one
solution, sometimes no real solutions. Is there a way to predict the number of solutions to a quadratic equation without
actually solving the equation?

Yes, the quantity inside the radical of the Quadratic Formula makes it easy for us to determine the number of solutions.
This quantity is called the discriminant.

Identify the Most Appropriate Method to Use to Solve a Quadratic Equation

We have used four methods to solve quadratic equations:

  · Factoring
  · Square Root Property
  · Completing the Square
  · Quadratic Formula

You can solve any quadratic equation by using the Quadratic Formula, but that is not always the easiest method to use.

             ...

                 HOW TO

Identify the most appropriate method to solve a Quadratic Equation.

Step 1.  Try Factoring first. If the quadratic factors easily, this method is very quick.
Step 2.
         Try the Square Root Property next. If the equation fits the form  or                , it can easily be
Step 3.
         solved by using the Square Root Property.

         Use the Quadratic Formula. Any quadratic equation can be solved by using the Quadratic Formula.

What about the method of completing the square? Most people find that method cumbersome and prefer not to use it.
We needed to include it in this chapter because we completed the square in general to derive the Quadratic Formula.
You will also use the process of completing the square in other areas of algebra.

Find the Axis of Symmetry and Vertex of a Parabola

Look again at Figure 10.3. Do you see that we could fold each parabola in half and that one side would lie on top of the
other? The `fold line' is a line of symmetry. We call it the axis of symmetry of the parabola.

We show the same two graphs again with the axis of symmetry in blue. See Figure 10.4.

                  Figure 10.4

The equation of the axis of symmetry can be derived by using the Quadratic Formula. We will omit the derivation here

and proceed directly to using the result. The equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph of  is

So, to find the equation of symmetry of each of the parabolas we graphed above, we will substitute into the formula
            .

Look back at Figure 10.4. Are these the equations of the dashed red lines?

The point on the parabola that is on the axis of symmetry is the lowest or highest point on the parabola, depending on
whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. This point is called the vertex of the parabola.

We can easily find the coordinates of the vertex, because we know it is on the axis of symmetry. This means its
x-coordinate is . To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute the value of the x-coordinate into the quadratic
equation.

Find the Intercepts of a Parabola

When we graphed linear equations, we often used the x- and y-intercepts to help us graph the lines. Finding the
coordinates of the intercepts will help us to graph parabolas, too.

Remember, at the y-intercept the value of is zero. So, to find the y-intercept, we substitute    into the equation.

Let's find the y-intercepts of the two parabolas shown in the figure below.

        Earlier, we saw that quadratic equations have 2, 1, or 0 solutions. The graphs below show examples of parabolas for
        these three cases. Since the solutions of the equations give the x-intercepts of the graphs, the number of x-intercepts is

1196 Answer Key

157. The number should be            159. He meant that he should
        greater than 44. Since               have packed half the
        80% equals 0.8 in decimal            shorts and twice the
        form, 0.8 is less than one,          shirts.
        and we must multiply the
        number by 0.8 to get 44,
        the number must be
        greater than 44.
