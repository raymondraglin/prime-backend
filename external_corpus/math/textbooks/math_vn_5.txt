Watch the videos and take notes on this sheet

1. Researchers are interested in how many people have been evicted from their housing.
    Draw a diagram to represent the population, sample, parameter and statistic.

2. What is a representative sample?

Basic Types of Statistical Studies

Observational Studies
Example: Researchers examined health records of thousands of males to determine whether
there was a relationship between family history and heart attack.

Experiment
Example: Researchers want to investigate whether taking aspirin regularly reduces the risk of
heart attack. Four hundred people who identify as men are divided randomly into two
groups: one group will take aspirin, and the other group will take a sugar pill. At the end of
the study, researchers count the number of men in each group who have had a heart attack.

Treatment group:                               Control group:

Random Selection:

Placebo:                                       Placebo effect:

Single-blind:                                  Double-blind:

Observational Case-Controlled
Example: A group of disabled women aged 65 and older was tracked for several years, ending
in 2010. Those who had a vitamin B12 deficiency were found to be twice as likely to suffer
severe depression as those who did not.

         Subjects were separated into two categories:

Caution:

Margin of Error and Confidence Intervals
Example: According to a gallup.com poll in 2017, 29% of hourly workers and 41% of salaried
workers are completely satisfied with the amount of money they earn. The survey had a
margin of error of ±5%. Source: http://www.gallup.com/poll/216746/hourly-workers-unhappier-
salaried-job-aspects.aspx?g_source=WWWV7HP&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles

Write the confidence interval for each group:

Hourly Workers:                                Salaried Workers:

Types of Bias in Statistical Studies
What is bias in general?

What is bias in a statistical study?

   Sources of bias
   Sampling bias - when the sample is not representative of the population

         Voluntary response bias - the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is
         volunteers
   Self-interest study - bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the
         outcome
   Response bias - when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason
         Perceived lack of anonymity - when the responder fears giving an honest answer
         might negatively affect them
         Loaded questions - when the question wording influences the responses
   Non-response bias - when people refusing to participate in the study can influence the
         validity of the outcome

In each situation, identify a potential source of bias

   a. A survey asks how many sexual partners a person has had in the last year

b. A radio station asks readers to phone in their choice in a daily poll.

c. A substitute teacher wants to know how students in the class did on their last test. The
    teacher asks the 10 students sitting in the front row to state their latest test score.

d. High school students are asked if they have consumed alcohol in the last two weeks.

e. The Beef Council releases a study stating that consuming red meat poses little
    cardiovascular risk.

f. A poll asks, "Do you support a new transportation tax, or would you prefer to see our
   public transportation system fall apart?"

Two Types of Data

                   Quantitative (Numerical)  Qualitative (Categorical)

Description

Example

Types of Graphs

Graphing Qualitative Data
Example 1. A movie review website lists eight 5-star films, nineteen 4-star films, twelve 3-star
films, seven 2-star films, and four 1-star films.

a. Make a frequency table for the data.

Movie     Frequency  Relative Frequency      Cumulative Frequency
Rating          8
5-star         19
4-star         12
3-star          7
2-star          4
1-star
 Total

b. Create the table in a spreadsheet, and then make a frequency bar graph and relative
    frequency bar graph. Label the axes and give the graph a meaningful title.

c. Make a frequency and relative frequency pie chart using a spreadsheet. Label the axes and
    give the graph a meaningful title.

Please print your graphs from the spreadsheet as a pdf or insert them into word docs
and upload them with your notes.

Graphing One-Variable Quantitative Data
Example 2. Here is a set of 15 exam scores for a fictional MTH 105 class at PCC.

          31, 62, 65, 70, 76, 81, 82, 82, 87, 88, 89, 94, 95, 98, 100

a. Make a Histogram using a bin-width of 10 points. Label the axes and give the graph a
    meaningful title.
