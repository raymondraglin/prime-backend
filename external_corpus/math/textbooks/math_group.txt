                1.1-1.2: Logic in Everyday Life, Sets and Venn Diagrams

Group Activity

1. Discuss each statement and decide which are propositions. Circle or highlight them.

a) Are you hungry?
b) Janae was nominated for student council president.
c) Four pounds less.
d) 7 + 8 = 33

2. A proposition is given, represented by the letter p. Write the wording for the negation
     and double negation.

    p: Hannah eats apples.
    not p:
    not not p:

3. More negations. Read the following and decide whether logging will continue. "The

4. On this California ballot measure, what's the result of a "yes" vote?

    Ballot question title: Redistricting. State Senate Districts. Referendum.

12. Compound Statements: Some courses at PCC and other colleges have complex sets of
     prerequisites. For each class, list all the minimum ways a student could meet the
     prerequisites.

a. ART275 Printmaking II.
    Prerequisites: ART 272 or ART 273 or ART 274

b. AD256 Advanced Counseling and Addiction.
    Prerequisites: AD 160 or (AD 150 and AD 151)

c. BA285 Human Relations-Organizations.
    Prerequisite: (WR 115 and RD 115) or IRW 115 and MTH 20 or equivalent
    placement. Note: IRW 115 is integrated reading and writing.

d. CIS277A Data Analytics.
    Prerequisites: CIS 125D or CIS 275, and (WR 115 and RD 115) or IRW 115 and MTH 20

                              1.2: Sets and Venn Diagrams

13. Pizza Venn Diagrams

Let's continue the last example with P representing pepperoni, H representing ham, and M
representing mushrooms. Shade or color in the appropriate area(s) for each pizza on the
Venn diagrams below.

Pepperoni &                Cheese  Veggie                       Supreme
 Mushroom                                                  (everything on it)

Qualified Propositions

14. Draw a Venn diagram for each qualified or categorical proposition. Then write on the line
     whether the sets are disjoint, overlapping, or one is a subset of the other.

                                   Relationship between the Sets

a. Some bikes are orange.          _________________________________

b. All bicycles have wheels.       _________________________________

c. No bikes are alive.             _________________________________

15. Interpreting values on a Venn diagram

A survey was taken to see which
professional sports were watched by
students. Let F represent football, B
represent basketball, and H represent
hockey.

Answer the following questions (use
complete sentences). Show any
calculations that were used.

16. Challenge Problem - read the wording very carefully.

150 people attending a concert were asked if they played piano, guitar, or drums.

10 could play all three.
73 could play guitar.
18 couldn't play any of these instruments.
21 could play piano and drums.
49 could play at least two of the instruments.
13 could play piano and guitar but not drums.
69 could play drums or guitar but not piano.

    G represent guitar, and
    D represent drums.

Calculate and fill in the values for all eight regions.
