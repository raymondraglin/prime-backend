Rounding - May be Review

Step 1. Determine the place to which the number is to be rounded. Circle or underline it.

Step 2. If the digit to the right of the number to be rounded is less than 5, replace it and all the digits
to the right of it by zeros. If the digit to the right of the underlined number is 5 or higher, increase the
underlined number by 1 and replace all numbers to the right by zeros. If the zeros are decimal digits,
you may eliminate them.

                       Converting Percentages to Decimals - May be Review

Percent means per 100, so depending on which way we are converting, we move the decimal 2 places
to the left or to the right.

Percent to decimal

50% means 50/100. When we divide this we get 0.50 or 0.5. Notice how the decimal is now 2 places
to the left.

Decimal to percent

0.25 is read as 25 hundredths, which can be written as 25/100. This is 25%. Notice how the decimal
place is now 2 places to the right.

then multiply.

Absolute and Relative Change
Absolute change is the difference in two quantities and has the same units as the original
quantities.
Relative change is the absolute change and is written as a percentage increase or decrease.

                                      starting quantity

The starting quantity is called the base of the percent change.

                       1.4: Proportional Reasoning

Class Prep Assignment  Due at the beginning of next class

Watch the video on Proportional Reasoning and take notes on this page.

     Does a runner run a 5,000-meter race at the same rate they run a 100-meter race?
     Should the amount of taxes a person pays be related to their income?
     Should a state's representation in the U.S. government be related to the population of

         the state?

Proportional: When two quantities have the same relative size, or the same ratio or rate. In a
proportional relationship, one quantity is always a constant multiple of the other.

1. Tax example. Julia makes $40,000 a year and pays $6,800 in taxes. Fabiana makes
    $400,000 a year and pays $50,000 in taxes. Are these ratios proportional?

2. Shopping example. Cans of chickpeas are $1.25 each or 4 for $5.00. Are these rates
    proportional?

Ratio: A comparison of two like quantities without units                Page 4
Rate: A fraction of two unlike quantities (has units with "per")
Unit Rate: A rate where the denominator is one unit

    3. Identify each as a ratio, rate, or unit rate

Reflection: Give an example of a complex problem to solve in your life. How did you
approach it?

Watch the videos on Problem Solving and take notes on these pages.

A Problem Solving Process
    1. Identify the question(s) you're trying to answer. Do any research needed to understand
         the context.
    2. Identify the information you have and any information you may need. Look up or
         estimate any missing information. Estimate the range of reasonable answers.
    3. Brainstorm and try out different mathematical tools to see what might be helpful. Use
         manipulatives, visuals or tables whenever possible. All ideas are useful, even if they
         don't work out.
    4. Choose one method to continue and get a potential solution.
    5. Check whether your solution makes sense. Is it reasonable? Can you get there a
         different way to confirm your answer? Return to Steps 1-5 as needed. When finished,
         explain your conclusion.

Operation Sense

then watch the video.

1. You have two similar job offers. Which one would you choose and why?
     Job A: $50K per year salary, 3 weeks of paid vacation per year, and a benefits
         package valued at $9K. The company will match 6% of retirement contributions.
     Job B: $24 per hour, 40 hours per week, 2 weeks of paid vacation per year, and a
         benefits package valued at $10K per year. The company will match 5% of
         retirement contributions.

For the problem above, reflect on how you used your operation sense and number sense.
